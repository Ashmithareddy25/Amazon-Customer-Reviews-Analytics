0439813786|4.0|The only reason I know this book exists is because of the film adaptation. By page 2 I knew exactly why Scorsese made this movie.<br /><br /> The main character, Hugo, has a lot of worries. Like a character from one of the old fairy tales he once learned from his father, he is completely alone, driven to dishonesty and surrounded by figures who appear to be dangerous enemies. All he has are the comforts of his innate mechanical genius, a broken automaton left to him by his father, and the sheer compulsion to bring the automaton back to life.<br /><br />The mixture of pictures and text (which are never together on one page), evoking an old silent film, is full of charm. Selznick describes (with words, but mostly with pictures) the transformative experience of seeing a movie--a newly invented form of magic, your dreams brought to life, as he tells the story.<br /><br />Other wonderful elements are:<br /><br />Hugo's compulsion to finish his project--and his view that fixing the automaton is the most important task in the world. You don't see that every day in children's books, but that compulsion toward the creative process is an interesting theme.<br /><br />The hostility of all Hugo's relationships. He's sneaky, angry, and confrontational with everyone. It makes perfect sense, but this is something else you don't often see in a children's story about (effectively) living on the streets.<br /><br />One the other hand, I didn't know what to make of Papa Georges. For 90% of the book, his mood ranged from cranky to bitterly angry and cruel. (Not giving away his identity) you learn that much of his life's work has been lost or destroyed. But there is something that can lift his spirits: recognition from the right people... Interesting. Maybe this is just an honest look at people in his line of work?<br /><br />Again, not to give anything away, but I was surprised Selznick did not lay any accusations at that old thief, Thomas Edison, because he definitely played a role in this story.<br /><br />The pace was a little off for me. While the story was easy to follow, there were so few words that the plot sometimes advanced very quickly in just a few sentences and I felt cheated out of some of the mood. At the same time, I lingered over some of the drawings for their beauty, and that slowed the action quite a bit. If it -were- a movie, then the rate at which information reached my eyes would have been out of my control, and normally this is something I -prefer- about books--the way you control how fast you go. This time I felt like I was awkwardly driving a stick shift.<br /><br />Overall, the book was visually, historically, and thematically interesting. I can't wait to see what Scorsese saw when he read it!easy to follow, there were so few words that the plot sometimes advanced very quickly in just a few sentences and I felt cheated out of some of the mood.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|This is a pretty good show.  I'm definately glad I saw it.  It differs from the books a bit though, so don't expect to see the sdame story the Terry Goodkind spelled out in Wizard's First Rule.  Although I understand the need to deviate on some points because this is a television show, I do wish they had kept some of the details the same.  I especially feel this way about the way they killed Darken Rahl.  That is what taught Richard and Kahlan that they needn't fear her Confessor's touch in the books, but in the television series they carry on believing that Kahlan's touch would destroy Richard, continuing to keep them apart, which is a tragic departure from the storyline that I felt really shouldn't have been altered.  The other changes, as I said, I could understand because of the fact that it is a television show and they have to have different challenges for each episode or the show would utterly fail.

0374275637|5.0|Behavioral Economics is perhaps the most popular genre of non-fiction in the last decade. With bestsellers by the likes of Malcolm Gladwell, Steven D. Levitt, Dan Ariely, Richard Thaler, Tim Harford, and a number of other qualified journalists and academics, it seems as though the field contains an infinite wealth of fascinating material. And, it could be said, that all of this is due in large part to the work of Daniel Kahneman.<br /><br />As a part of the pioneering team with Amos Tversky, Kahneman has practically shaped Behavioral Economics since the 1960s, when they began conducting experiments. This book brings together all of Kahneman's findings in one coherent study.<br /><br />Since Kahneman's work has been so influential, a lot of the ideas presented here might not be new. Cognitive biases such as loss aversion, priming, and framing have all been presented and analyzed in nearly every Behavioral Economics book out there. But, while the ideas are not novel, it is rewarding to hear analysis from the original source of the studies. Kahneman provides insights into the rationale of the studies that other writers could not offer, and so this book seems more penetrative than the others. Where his successors string together pieces of interesting yet seemingly incoherent tid bits about cognition and behavior, Kahneman proposes a much more developed thesis on human cognition.<br /><br />That thesis is summarized by the title--that there are two ways humans think and make decisions, \\"fast\\" and \\"slow,\\" and that we cannot disregard either when considering people's thoughts and actions. The two ways can be described by a number of dichotomies: The first method of thinking is automatic, the second is controlled; the first is effortless, the second effortful; and so on. An easier way to describe the two systems would be to identify them as subconscious and conscious, though Kahneman does not explicitly make this description, perhaps because these concepts are so loaded with meaning.<br /><br />Kahneman examines this concept by delving into the latest studies in the field and thus provides the avid Behavioral Economics reader a source of great new instances of it. The survey of cognitive errors includes research on the strange tendencies of golfers under stressful situations, parole officers after lunch, and shoppers under the influence of marketing ploys. As it has been in nearly all Behavioral Economics books, this material is absolutely fascinating and doesn't ever seem to lose its mystery.<br /><br />Of course, despite being so fascinating, Behavioral Economics as a discipline has its flaws, and this book is no exception. In general, the flaws have to do with the fact that the studies assumed to prove various cognitive errors are rather abstract by nature and so rely on a number of qualifications to even be useful. In order to analyze behavior, for instance, there need to be objective standards for \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" actions, which I'm not sure has been investigated as thoroughly as it should. It is for this reason that far reaching claims about human behavior being irrational and the subsequent calls for changes in social structure (by whatever means) are typically unfounded and lead down a dangerous road of regulation and control (Thaler's Nudge and Ariely's Predictably Irrational come to mind). Kahneman does not jump to these conclusions, and certainly does not propose policy action a la Thaler or Ariely, but he does lay the groundwork for such ventures--after all, he is the pioneer.<br /><br />Altogether, this book does not suffer from this inherent flaw, and rather simply encourages more study and debate. And that might make it a classic in the field.this concept by delving into the latest studies in the field and thus provides the avid Behavioral Economics reader a source of great new instances of it.

0307593312|3.0|A real disappointment. It's a very long book but the story in no way justifies its 900+ pages, particularly the last 200 which are a tedious slog. All the trademark Murakami strokes and tropes are here in spades--the overall shimmering/fata morgana weirdness that leaves the reader a little dizzy and gravity-less time and again. Mundane descriptions of people, places, and situations that from one moment to the next morph into things eerie, half-funny/half- ominous, sometimes miraculous. And as usual at the center is a slightly befuddled, directionless protagonist expertly cooking his lonely guy meals while listening to classical music. Predictably he is unwillingly swept up by a series of events that, like a tornado, throws his life and future into chaos. Also there's a mysterious woman with beautiful ears, a number of enigmatic dream sequences that are sometimes resolved but usually aren't... All familiar, frequently delightful stuff for Murakami readers. In small doses. But the novel is simply too long for the tale it tells; it should have been cut by many pages. I started reading with enthusiasm and high expectations because it's this sui generis author and his purported magnum opus. But after turning the last page I felt relieved, exhausted and shrug'y. A friend and rabid Murakami fan who read 1Q84 at the same time I did said, `I'm going to need drugs to finish this damned book.'    __________________________  One of the 2 very negative reviews of the book in The New York Times:    [..]

B004HW7JMO|3.0|Not sure I understand all these five-star reviews. A decent effort but quite lacking when compared to everything that came before it. If you're new to Spartacus and wondering whether to watch this or Blood and Sand first, you have to watch Blood and Sand due to major spoilers in the first and last episodes. But really, it's money better spent anyways.<br /><br />If you're here reading reviews for Gods of the Arena, there's a good chance you loved the original -- Blood and Sand. I know I did. Campy but it had a great storyline and such depth of character. Raw and occasionally overdone but definitely evocative. I didn't know what to expect from this six-episode \\"prequel\\" arc. I was hoping to see Oenomaus fighting as a gladiator for the House of Batiatus, but this happens after that. There's really very little in the way of plot beyond Quintus and Lucretia's scheming ways. Having seen Blood and Sand, you pretty much know who will die and how things will turn out so no real suspense there. And Crixus' portrayal really missed the mark in my opinion.<br /><br />To make up for the lack of real substance and character depth, the show resorts to more racy sexual material to fill the time slot. I doubt most people would complain about this, but it feels like the writers focused more on raunchy sex scenes than the story. A shame because Gannicus had such promise and as a viewer you never really know much about him.<br /><br />So three stars. Decent, not amazing.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I have been a Coldplay fan for many years now and my opinions as to which album was their best sounding have varied. I like them all, but \\"X&Y\\" and \\"Parachutes\\" have not held up as well over time as \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends.\\" So writing a review for \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" less than 24 hours after I purchased it, I cannot predict whether I'll like it more or less by the time the band releases their next album.   That said, this release exceeded my expectations, which were initially high but began to fade as I heard the group was moving in more of a pop direction. Discovering that Rihanna was going to be part of the album didn't help. But after I listened to the album from start to finish, something happened that is typical when I listen to a great album. I listened to most of the songs again and again, and they seemed fresh each time.   The album isn't flawless, however. In fact, it's a much less consistant listen than their previous one. The real gems here are found mostly in the first half of the album. Everything from the 43 second opening title track to \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall\\" is excellent. From there, it's a mixed bag. \\"U.F.O.\\" sounds like something from \\"Parachutes\\", but isn't a standout track. \\"Princess of China\\" with Rihanna is a surprisingly good track, albeit one of the two most poppy songs on the album. That is followed by \\"Up In Flames\\", which I'm not impressed with after multiple listens. It could grow on me, but it's just too repititive. The album improves again from there. \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\" includes perhaps the fastest tempo of any Coldplay song.   It's understandable that some fans have expressed concern about the new sound Coldplay is exploring with this album. My opinion is this: It worked this time.   I enjoyed this album and it was worth the wait. But this is the limit when it comes to pop. Coldplay should, and probably will, try a different sound with their next album. They'd be wise not to venture further into pop.
0440244412|5.0|Holy crap. This series is awesome and this is one of the best books in the whole series. No wait --- it IS the best in the series. How amazing that the books could just keep getting better!!!! I was sure that Barrons wasn't dead, but of course, in the back of my mind I was thinking, \\"Yeah, but what if he IS???\\". The book would have been nothing without Barrons and his wonderful, terrible, awful, heartbreaking secrets. He is one of the most completely satisfying characters I have ever read. But you have to read the whole series to \\"get\\" him. You won't like him at the beginning, but you'll be wishing you were Mac, if only to be \\"his\\", by the end. I know for sure that I'll re-read this series at some point(s) in the future. I truly loved it. SIX stars.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|I respect the concept of the movie in a day where torture and gore passes as horror but it did little for me.  I get the plot, negativity etc. but I think it would have been better if the couple mistakenly allowed the entity in instead of the boyfriend being a jerk. It would've been cool if unrelated stress along with the camera etc inadvertently allowed the creature in. The confusion is the terror. The biggest problem I had was.... the lack of a good ole Priest!  The FIRST place I would've gone is to the closest Catholic Church...and I'm not Catholic lol!  By the end it was annoying. Then, the entire concept of imagination was ruined by the girl killing the guy on camera. Would've been better just to have the screams, silence, maybe 2 minutes of nothing or slight shadow shifts, and credits.

Natalie is working hard to get 'inside' the mind of Nikki Heat, the fictional character from Castle's books based on Det. Beckett.  What begins as a friendly offer to help give insight into Nikki's inspiration becomes a funny but somewhat annoying attempt by Natalie to 'mirror' Kate. Kate's annoyance only adds flavor to the complex relationship between her and Castle.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|After 2 and a half years, the original American Idol is back with her fifth cd 'Stronger'. And truthfully by listening to the album in full you can count the ways that our girl is indeed Stronger. The lyrics and the sound is more mature, but she still gives you that Kelly Attitude we all love. The lead single 'Mr. Know It All' was merely an introduction to a great album. The hopefully second single 'What Doesn't Kill You' brings back the tradition guitar strong and jumping she's known for. I could go play by play with each track, but i'll let you listen for yourself. From the spooky yet guitar driven 'Darkside' to the mathematically clever 'Einstein' and I can't forget a couple of my favorites, 'I Forgive You', 'Let Me Down' and 'Don't You Wanna Stay'. The album is different from the others, but still traditional Kelly. It's worth every penny.

B005YVSIZ4|5.0|This episode specifically, like one other reviewer posted, is definitely in the top 3 of the series.  I despise the director for these unbearable cliff hangers, but each installment always delivers, so it's worth the suspense in the end.  This is definitely one series worth watching.  It's come at the perfect time to tap into the rising zombie fad as well.  The best part about the show is that the zombie apocalypse is only the setting, not the story in and of itself.  Good character development and suspense put this one, in my opinion, just a notch above Romero (be gentle).

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Many Coldplay fans were really worried about this upcoming release. It takes years for the band to drop a new album, and many felt that those years would have been waited in vain. This album was originally intended to be an acoustic album, but as they went on they decided to let the songs develop in whatever way they felt necessary. The result? A breaking down of barriers in the musical world.  Mylo Xyloto has something for Coldplay fans across the board. If you're into oldplay, then songs like Us Against the World, Up In Flames, Up With the Birds, and U.F.O. will satisfy you.  If you're looking for something new (and catchy after a few listens) I'd suggest Charlie Brown, which is a coldplayesque pop track. Paradise, Princess of China, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall, and Hurts Like Heaven are also great tracks that have a completely new flavor previously foreign to the band.  As with all Coldplay albums, the songs are growers, by that I mean you need to give them a few listens before judging them. Coldplay is less about an immediately catchy tune, and more about connecting with an individual once they're familiar with the depth they offer in each song. It isn't a shallow quick fix, though they have a few commercial songs on the album that seem to aim to do that.  One great thing about MX is the fact that it tells a story from start to finish. I won't spoil anything but I will say what the band has said: It's about two characters who fall in love; Mylo and Xyloto. They meet in a big-city where they're being oppressed, and they try to express themselves and stay together in midst of all the opposition. The ending is bittersweet. Happy, but bittersweet.  I'll comment a bit on a few of the tracks, but I won't give away the ending. There will be spoilers throughout, but I'll leave the ending for people to read on their own. (SPOILER ALERT)  Hurts Like Heaven introduces the setting - the big city in which Mylo and Xyloto live in.  Paradise introduces the girl, Xyloto.  Charlie Brown introduces the boy, and in this track they fall in love. \\"All the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world\\" I feel like it's about a wild night on the town (stole they key, took the car downtown where the lost boys meet) and it ends with Mylo and Xyloto finally falling in love (See the gentle piano instrumental at the end, it seems like they had a great night, then split, but spent the rest of the night thinking of each other.)  Every Tear is a celebration of life in hard times. It's about expressing yourself in any way in an oppressive environment and banding together. The lyrics that suggest expression are: Cathedrals in my heart, turn the music up, my heart starts beating to my favorite song, heaven is in sight, etc.   Banding Together/Celebrating Life: All the kids they dance, all the kids all night, as we ascend, I swear you emerge blinking into, to tell me it's alright.  In the midst of oppression: You can hurt, hurt me bad, still I'll raise this flag.  Also, the line \\"Every siren is a symphony, and every tear's a waterfall\\" suggests that every cop siren (representing oppression) is beautiful in the sense that it shows we're standing up for something, a revolution, or whatever have you. Every tear shed by the 'kids' has great mountainous significance (or waterfall-like significance :P)  I know I'm ranting about this one particular track, but I'll end it with this: I also see Mylo and Xyloto in this. They're there for each other when it says \\"You emerge blinking into, to tell me it's all right\\"  Major Minus is about the big government pursuing people and spying on them. \\"One eye watching you, etc\\"  I believe things turn sour for Mylo and Xyloto here.  U.F.O. is about a hopeful/regretful Mylo hoping he can reunite with Xyloto after the events that occurred in the dark \\"Major Minus\\" He's wishing for their happily ever after.  Princess of China is them meeting to discuss what had happened in an attempt to work things out. It seems they both had hurt each other, and Mylo had walked out on Xyloto at one point. \\"'but no, you had to go; you really hurt me, etc\\"  Up in Flames is one of my favorite tracks because Mylo realizes that he lost Xyloto for good. This is a song about heartbreak. \\"So it's over, this time I know it's gone, this time you fly alone, I only know I'm wrong, Up in flames, can we put some water on?\\"  I love this song because it's so stripped down and basic. It's raw and emotional. Simply amazing.  Up With the Birds contains all the spoilers. Coldplay has said that the album has a happy ending. I won't tell you guys what happens with Mylo and Xyloto since I don't want to spoil it for others that may accidentally read it. But I'll just say this; to me it's very bittersweet. I believe this takes place once the oppression is over, and Mylo has a certain goal. That is all.  4/5 stars because I felt like it had too many transition tracks (short instrumentals between songs) I like that the album is short, but I thought the transition tracks were slightly too frequent.  *The above are my interpretation of the story. You can listen to the lyrics and come to a different conclusion about the story between the two characters in the album.  **The lyrics above may be off/out of order. My apologies for the sloppiness, but I do hope this review helps people on deciding whether they should buy the album or not.  ***Lastly, most people criticize Coldplay for developing and experimenting. Don't listen to them. Hear them out yourself and you be the judge. At this point, no matter what Coldplay does, someone will complain about something. I'd rather have them grow then have the same sound as they did when they came out. As I said before, they have songs that'll satisfy oldplay fans as well as new fans.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I gave the author three decades. Unfortunately  this Author had a harsh negative bias about his subject.  This bias created a narrative that will make him a hero of the anti-Apple crowd who hate Apple and Steve jobs with a personal intensity that is hard to classify or put ones arms around.  The Author is the Fox News Producer of Biographers where inconvenient facts are either left out, blurred , twisted or  obfuscated to fit a  narrative that was filled with personal animosity.   The worst part is; Steve never saw this book. I can't imagine his family getting a preview of it either. Of course the publisher and the author would have been agreeable to waiting to after Steve died to market this trash. Do not buy this book. If you do , you put money into the author and publisher's pockets that do not belong to them. If both Publisher and Author had one iota of decency they would pledge all their profits to charity.   I feel for his family and the Apple employees who would have followed him anywhere except the horrible slow death he went through.   The book is complete and utter trash.
1594484805|5.0|This book was an excellent read. Very fast paced and very insightful. It was also quite thought provoking and is not a \\"motivator\\" or \\"self-help\\" type book, but rather, it delves into the social science and economics behind motivation. It somewhat reminded me of Freakonomics crossed with other factors. I think it offers a unique perspective on something we all deal and struggle with- motivation, whether in the workplace, at home, or other aspects of our lives. Highly recommend.
0061906220|5.0|A delightful story and fun read-a-loud, I used this book with kindergarten students along with the music. It was a big hit. The book is so fun the students don't even realize that they are learning colors along the way.  I also like the message that while life is full of changes, that doesn't mean life can't still be good.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|Wow!  I have only heard the album once thus far.  I really didn't know what to expect as I had read all the conflicting reviews via Amazon yesterday, prior to my preview.  I have to say that it is their most upbeat and atmospheric album to date.  I remember first hearing the band back in 2000 when ABC TV played the song 'Yellow\\" to advertise their fall 2000 TV show lineup.  After a little investigation I discovered their album \\"Parachutes\\" while browsing in the music retail store I managed at the time. I immediately bought it and, as a result, became an instant fan at that point.  I was also a fan of The Beatles and listened to them when I was very young.  I recall anticipating each successive release, from the folky \\"Rubber Soul\\" to the psychedelic, hard rock tinged \\"Revolver\\" to the trippy, elysian mood of \\"Sgt. Pepper's....\\"  The group progressed, from album to album, in leaps and bounds.  I find this aspect of Coldplay's music comparable to The Beatles.  Coldplay has also progressed, musically, from album to album.  Their evolution in style is both a blessing and a curse to the band.  Those who like the style of their first, two albums would find it difficult to really appreciate and connect with their later offerings (i.e., \\"Viva La Vida\\" and \\"Mylo Xyloto\\").  Let me say that I am one who personally favors musical progression.  I really can't report on the album on a song by song basis, only having heard it just the one time, so far.  However, there are a couple of songs worth mentioning.  First, the song \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" is a total departure for them.  In fact, I really didn't even recognize Chris' voice in that song.  It is probably the most upbeat song in their entire catalogue and features very catchy, musical hooks.  I noticed that there were around three gorgeous ballads on the new album, the first being \\"Us Against The World.\\"  I had heard \\"Every Teardrop\\" and \\"Major Minus\\" from their digital download released during the summer.  The latter song is very U2 inspired.  I only wish that \\"Moving To Mars\\" would have been included right after Major Minus, as it originally appeared on the downloaded E.P.  That is the only drawback of this album. I had heard \\"Paradise\\" on Letterman's show around a month ago.  It sounds so much better on the album! I rather liked \\"Princess of China,\\" with Chris sharing vocals with Rihanna.  It is an interesting song with its intentional distortion. I feel she actually adds to rather than detracts from the song.  The new album is very lush in its production. There are a lot of interesting keyboard effects layered throughout the album. Brian Eno, and the other producers, have done an excellent job adding to this aural landscape for the ears.  Let me also say that it was nice to have all new copies released in the standard \\"jewel box\\"  once again. The reversible album cover insert is also a clever touch.  Needless to say I will be listening to the album with a great deal of frequency in the days ahead.  Congratulations to the band and the producers for another excellent job, well done!
0345472322|3.0|In Mindset, Carol Dweck points out the difference between people with growth mindsets, who just want to learn, and those with fixed mindsets, who feel a pressure to prove to others that they are smart. Fixed mindset people experience failure as something wrong with them. Growth mindset people use failure as an opportunity. Guess which mindset education, especially higher education whether experienced as a student or faculty, channels most people into. Dweck gives her readers information about how to get unstuck by changing their thinking into more successful patterns. Her book is heavy on examples: you can probably get the point by reading chapters 1-3 and 8.
B003L77G8I|5.0|They've done it again. Creating episodes that are fun, emotional, interesting,give you something new to learn, etc. Oh, and as always they leave you wanting more. I honestly would love if they would continue making new seasons of Bones for the rest of their lives! (But something in me doubts that they'll do that) Anyways if you've never watched Bones before you most definitely should.
6305291446|5.0|Plot: In 1963 Michael killed his first sister and in 1978 he went after his second! Now it is 1998 and he has found her once again! Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a teacher at a private school and has a son! But every night she is relived by the haunting memory of the Halloween night twenty years ago and now that her nightmare has returned she must make a choice... run, or fight back!  Review: With its $17 million budget Steve Miner (Director of Lake Placid/Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3D/Day of the Dead (2008)/ and This Movie), Robert Zappia (Writer for this Movie) and Matt Greenberg (Also a Writer for this movie) came up with a story that does the original justice and creates a great balance between hostility and hospitality! Although I do wish they explored Laurie Strode's foster family let alone her real family in the movies before creating this one... although I do appreciate Part 6 for revisiting Laurie Strode's foster family! A big flaw I found in this one though was the scene with Michael starring at the kid and it shows his \\"Eye\\" but in part two you see both his eyes shot and the eye in part seven looks totally intact! It was a superb addition to the Halloween franchise though and I don't think they could get any better than this except none of the sequels have anything on the original and can never measure up!  Acting: It's got solid actors, LL Cool J, Jamie Lee Curtis and many more and everyone did great in with there acting skills! I never felt like it had bad moments of dialogue either! Everything is in order about this movie and I love that!  Gore: multiple stabbings, a gross broken leg, two slit throats, a cleat to the face, and an infamous decapitation! it had its moments and when they came they were violent!  Bottom Line: $76 million was made from this movie (Including rentals) and it is one of the most successful Halloween movies of the series! It had great acting, some good blood and gore scenes, a great idea for a plot, and I adore the fact that Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is so bad-ass in this one... even more than Michael Myers!  Rated: R for terror violence/gore, and language  Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 5 (Doesn't really depend, both the versions, don't have anything good on them besides the movie itself!)  For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5
030788743X|5.0|I will be honest, I am not a big reader.  However, when I do read I like to read subjects that grab me don't let go until the end.  That is exactly what this book did.  It literally sucked me into the world of the future where OASIS is king and the only thing that matters is finding the 3 easter eggs buried by the games creator, as well as they the 3 gates they open.  This book is a joy to read from start to finish and as a former \\"hardcore\\" MMO player it really hit home.  It teaches a very valuable life lesson,  I wish others would follow.  This is a must read! And to the author, please write some more books like this one, fantastic work!
B00386EZJU|5.0|I didn't expect to love this movie and I most certainly didn't expect to still be drooling (figuratively) over the soundtrack months later. Truly spectacular score, up there with Lord of the Rings. Some tracks I simply don't get tired of--Test Drive, See You Tomorrow, Forbidden Friendship (my favorite), New Tail, Romantic Flight. It's uplifting and exciting music, almost all of the way through. I'm not particularly a fan of the \\"battle\\"  music at the end of the CD (Battling the Green Death and Counter Attack, mainly, though The Cove and Dragon's Den get tiresome as well), but I enjoy just about everything else.  The CD also plays very well on the surround sound system we have for the TV, and as a homeschooler armed with a math textbook, I love that about it.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Book is excellent for pre-teen readers. Lots of humor and of course adventure and excitement. Great if you are teaching a unit on Greek mythology as I am. The students LOVE the book, and many have read the other 4 in the series.

B0053YGYO4|1.0|This album needs to be stripped down, remixed or redone with a different producer. I popped this cd in the player to listen to it during the drive home. After the first track I was wondering what the heck was going on. After 5 tracks I turned it off. This album had me constantly adjusting the volume control. It fatigues the ears brutally! I have enjoyed every one of Coldplay's albums in the past but this one is getting filed to likely never to be listened to again. bad, just really bad. Could have been great tho', I think there are some decent songs beneath all the over dubs.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Having owned Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Final Cut, Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell in their previously most recent remastered form (I still have DSOTM and The Wall on MoFi), I approached this set with a bit of apprehension. I had considered buying the \\"Oh, By the Way\\" box set when it was issued, but decided against it when I read that I already had the most recent remastered versions of the previously listed albums contained in that set. The pricing and numerous bootleg sets were cautionary as well. I bought this set after reading about the \\"painstaking\\" remastering supposedly taking place for the entire studio catalog. I am happy to say that I was not disappointed. I hear definite improvements on all of the releases I used to own, especially Animals and WYWH. On DSOTM the variation is not as pronounced, but there is a tad better depth to the soundscape than I could hear before. The same for the others as well.  The older releases are great; they sound as if they belong in the here and now, not whispering in the ether banks of yesteryear. In short, an excellent, in some cases stellar remastering job and well worth purchasing for that reason alone. As for the packaging, it is, as some have pointed out, similar to the Beatles stereo box set, with an important difference. In the Beatles set, the discs are crammed so tightly into their sleeves that I bought some slim line disc jewel cases for alternative storage to prevent scratching them every time I wanted a listen. On the Discovery box, the CDs slip easily in and out of their sleeves. As long as you're careful, you should be able to avoid mussing up your discs. I agree that quality miniature LP sleeves ala \\"Oh,By the Way\\" would have been preferable (and more thought could have gone into the accompanying 60 page book; it adds little value), but I think the remastering work on Discovery more than offsets the packaging issue and earns this box set five stars from me on that virtue alone.

B00511PTWM|5.0|Exactly What I Needed to Use My GPS and Ipod Simultanously!<br /><br />It's a tough decision, but I almost always choose to use my GPS device, leaving my ipod for another time.  Now I do not have to choose.  With this AmazonBasics Dual Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter, I can use both at the same time.<br /><br />Here's my experience with the AmazonBasics Dual Port Swivel Cigarette Lighter Adapter:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Couldn't be easier to install.  Push it into the cigarette lighter, swivel it to the best position,  then push the two devices you want to use into the dual receptacles.<br /><br />2.  I cannot tell any difference in the performance of my GPS or my ipod when I'm using this device.  They both receive plenty of power for great performance.  I'm ready for a road trip.<br /><br />3.  This device is very inexpensive, especially when I consider the pleasure I receive from having both devices functioning simultaneously.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Although it is not a problem with the device itself because you can swivel its position on the console, I do notice a lot of crowding on the panel that also has the gear shift and a console box. I'm not certain what design could alleviate this difficulty, so it may be simply a function of the car's design.  But crowded it is!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This is a great solution to a problem I've experienced repeatedly. I`m a happy camper.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|Okay, Coldplay has released one fantastic album after another so they are due for a mediocre one, right? And mediocre for Coldplay is still very good. That's what I feel about this album. It is a little over produced and a little repetitive but it still somehow works. I give it a B- for now, but it may grow on me.

1589944607|4.0|I have played this game at serious \\"board game night\\"s, and it was TONS of fun.  the Cylons have a slight advantage or slight disadvantage, depending on the number of players, and the humans are not guaranteed to win.    This will take 30-50 minutes per person to play, and has a bit of a learning curve.  I recommend leaving it out of a lineup until you have 2-4 people who want to learn.  Time and learning prevent me from giving this 5 stars.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's music was my introduction to Celtic style music. Since then I have branched out, but she is still one of my favorites. I like this CD because it seems to be a return to her music roots. I particularly liked her version of \\"Star of the County Down\\" on this CD.

1451648537|3.0|This new, highly-anticipated bio is reasonably comprehensive in scope, but written in a plodding, subjectively fawning fashion that undercuts its impact. Mr. Isaacson doesn't hail from the technology world, and it shows; his feel for the real importance of Jobs' accomplishments is largely constrained to social impact (of the fuzzy, gee-whiz sort) rather than crucial areas of interface, functionality and convergence. Why do Apple's products really work? What impact will they have on how we interact with the digital world, tomorrow and after? Isaacson has no idea. All he seems to know is that 'simplicity' is good, and that 'design' is more than skin deep. And that the little things matter. Millions upon millions of people already know that; the opportunity missed here is to go deep on the subject, and unpack it. That doesn't happen here, because the writer is out of his element.  Apart from that, we learn that Jobs was basically an ass, and that he cried a lot when he didn't get his way. It's implied that he carried a narcissistic disorder, but that's never really explored -- to the book's detriment, as psychiatric context is pretty important to understand how a comprehensive tyrant could achieve so much, and improve the productivity and satisfaction of so many.   The book is also overlong -- a remarkable thing given the richness of the subject. It's written almost as a sequential fact-finding report, rather than as a truly insightful look at a man and his work. We come away with the impression that strong-willed CEOs can do what they want, as long as they make money for shareholders and impart a sense of accomplishment (however painfully won) to their underlings. Not exactly a revelation, but it takes more than 600 pages for Isaacson to drive the point home.  I'm glad we have this bio, but I suspect someone will come along and write a much better treatment of Jobs' life. For now, don't expect to learn any larger truths about Jobs and his world; just enjoy the anecdotes, and  prepare to make your own conclusions about the book's fascinating subject.
0140544518|5.0|The first time I read this book was when I was very young, and it stuck with me for all those years. I saw it on Amazon and immediately stuck it to my wish list. As soon as I had the spare bucks I bought it. It's such a wonderfully imaginative spin on the Story of the Three Little Pigs! It still makes me laugh and entertains me to no end. I plan on reading this (as well as books like Goodnight Moon and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs) book to my future children, and I know they'll absolutely love it. And one day, they'll see it and the nostalgia will make them buy it too. And 3 cheers to tangible pieces of your childhood.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|I can't even imagine what Mr. Malick was thinking when he made this movie... talk about self indulgent!  Run, don't walk, and do something useful with your life.  What a waste!!!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I saw this was released and asked my wife to get it for my birthday but, unfortunately, she did. I won't beat a dead horse but it's like everyone else has said here, George Lucas is constantly tweaking some of the best films in cinema history. That's fine, but why refuse so adamantly to include the original theatrical versions for the purists? Is he just being a jerk? As for the Darth Vader \\"Noooooo...\\" atrocity, imagine watching \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and at the end Rhett Butler says, \\"Frankly my dear, I don't really care.\\" Imagine watching the Wizard of Oz and having the whistle blow from tin man's dance CGI'ed out and replaced with a 3D fireball because hey, technology has improved. If you want to experiment with the new technology, make a new movie, you hack. Really disappointed. It arrived today and I'm not even going to take the plastic off so I can return it. I foolishly assumed a massive blu-ray release would include the theatrical releases I fell in love with, I guess I should've checked first. I'm starting to think he will have them released after his death or something. I don't see any logic in his decisions whatsoever so it must be some odd artistic thing like that. All we have to do now is outlive George Lucas.  I've held out this long and I'm a lot younger than him.
B003Y5H542|5.0|In spite of so many negative reviews about this movie not being for children and being only mildly funny etc. I found it to not only be pretty funny but also one of the most beautiful looking blu-rays I've ever seen. The picture quality of this movie on Blu-ray is gorgeous and at times truly jaw droppingly detailed. The colors, textures and overall razor sharp presentation are truly first rate. The HD sound is also a standout and makes this a must own on Blu-ray in my opinion. I don't have children but I do enjoy a good \\"toon\\" from time to time and I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The disc also has some great extras as well that are in HD. Enjoy.

B003MVJG8Q|5.0|This was a good addition for my computer. Easy installation instructions to follow. The only problem i had was that after i installed the card first as instructed for windows 7, the computer would not boot up completely. I needed to remove the card and load the driver first. Dont know why it only worked like that, but then it worked flawlessly with my new 3.0 hard drive. Data transfer speed was noticably faster than with the usb 2.0. Also, the addition of a power adapter on the card is a nice addition for power to connected devices. And Just a reminder, The card does not come with usb 3.0 or power adapter cables for the power connector so order as needed.
1843793792|5.0|I'm a devoted fan of Georgette Heyer, and Venetia is one of my all-time favorites. Since I've read the book more times than I can count, I was concerned about this being an abridged version. Luckily I didn't miss the bits that were left out -- some of the jokes and a few interchanges that didn't move the story forward.<br /><br />Richard Armitage was an absolutely delightful Damerel, all purrs and growls. He captured the spirit of a rakish man of the world who finally finds a woman worthy of his passion. That reading alone is worth getting this audiobook, but Mr. Armitage also did a great job in portraying the other characters. I enjoyed Mrs. Scorrier's sharp and nasty voice, Edward's ponderous tones, and young Aubrey's snippy and scholarly remarks.<br /><br />Looking forward to enjoying more of these audiobooks.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|Had I known this book was an apparent starting point for a series and would basically have no resolution to any storyline started in it, I would have stopped reading halfway through.  The book is one long, detailed and slow set up of a story yet to be told.  Getting closer to the end, I was worried it was going to be one of those books that quickly ties things up in the last 100 pages, but instead it just sets up what will happen in the next book.<br /><br />There were a few likable characters, but they don't start to be fleshed out until more than halfway through.  If you are looking for a paranormal read, with some paranormal action, there is very little of that to be had amongst the witches, demons and vampires who all walk around being mostly human.  The romance was presented in a way that read 'well they are the 2 main characters so of course they will love each other so just go with it'.  I doubt I will read the next book, especially if it reads like the first.

034552554X|5.0|Victoria Jones was abandoned as a baby and grew up in the foster-care system, not spending more than a year with anyone. Never having felt loved by anyone, she's certain that she is incapable of the emotion herself.<br /><br />At the age of nine, she is placed with a single woman named Elizabeth Hastings, who owns a vineyard, where she also lives. Victoria stays with her the longest, discovering that she shares Elizabeth's love and talent for horticulture in general, as well as viticulture. It is Elizabeth who teaches Victoria the language of flowers, which Victoria eventually adopts as her major method of communication, completely aware that many people won't understand it.<br /><br />The narrative begins on Victoria's eighteenth birthday, as she is preparing to be transferred from a group home to The Gathering House, a \\"transitional home\\". Here, she'll have three months in which to find a job and start paying rent, or be evicted.<br /><br />Told in the first person in Victoria's viewpoint, we learn how she handles her first opportunity at self-sufficiency. In alternating chapters, she tells us the story of her arrival at Elizabeth's and the not-quite-a-year she lives with her.<br /><br />This book is not for the faint of heart. The language of flowers can be used to express negative emotions as well pleasant ones, and Victoria does both. Victoria's voice, as written by Diffenbaugh, is very powerful. We share her experiences almost viscerally, and in some instances it's impossible not to be repulsed by her actions while completely understanding her motivations.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh's prose is astonishing. This is one of those books where the reader is torn between wanting to know what happens and reading slowly in order to appreciate her communication using the written word while she teaches us the language of flowers.<br /><br />The book includes Victoria's Dictionary of Flowers as an appendix.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Back and Forth is an incredible documentary that gives an honest and rare peak backstage at the history of Foo Fighters.  A must for any fan as well as a wealth of information on how to make fantastic records.

Highly, highly, highly recommend this film!

B004J4WKTW|3.0|The book was OK.  I found the 'love story' to be reminiscent of Twilight (Hi my name is Celia/Marco, I am now madly in love with you and will give up everything to spend the rest of eternity with you), and I really couldn't have cared less about those characters in general.  I wanted to like them, but they were just so flat and annoying.  I'd even go so far as to say removing them from the book entirely wouldn't have been a huge loss, and may even have improved things.  I would have loved to read more about the secondary characters, particularly Poppet and Widget.  I didn't expect the story twist surrounding Tsukiko, but as with every other character she was severely underdeveloped.  It really wouldn't be difficult to weave a rich storyline surrounding these characters, and it might even be worth writing... but unless there is another author involved to develop the characters I wouldn't read it.  I enjoyed reading about the Circus itself, and felt that a backdrop so amazing was wasted on the weak and disjointed storyline.  The description of the circus itself and the numerous tents is the only redeeming quality of this book.  I wanted to learn more about this circus, to read about more tents, to hear about more of the performers.  This alone kept me turning the pages in this book.
B002S0OBMS|3.0|Oh, Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber. I was so disappointed in this two-disc set.  I had heard two pieces from it (\\"Love Never Dies\\" and \\"Till I Hear You Sing Once More\\") that I thought were stunningly beautiful.  I think that Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are both extraordinary talents.  So, despite my lack of fondness for the source material on which the musical was based, I sallied forth recently to obtain the cast album.  Dear me.  As the Phantom says in the original musical, what a lamentable mess.  Honestly, the only two noteworthy songs are the ones I already mentioned.  Squalling vaudeville choruses reminiscent of the comedic Kit Kat Club girls in \\"Guys and Dolls\\" seem to make up the majority of the work here.  How many versions of \\"Bathing Beauty\\" do we need to hear, really?  Karimloo and Boggess are both better than this material, sad to say.

1451648537|4.0|While it is only weeks since the untimely death of the great visionary Steve Jobs it is matter of historical certainty to place him firmly in the linage of great inventors and technological pioneers which include names like Bell, Faraday and Edison. Perhaps this book on Jobs life by Walter Isaacson previous biographer of Einstein and Franklin comes to soon after his passing away, alternatively you could argue that's its publication is ironically like a well timed Apple launch. This is particularly the case since it appears that Jobs had typically taken a long view and in 2004 first approached Issacson with this idea of becoming his biographer. The latter hesitated at that point but in 2009 when the tumor inside Jobs pancreas was taking a crippling hold his wife Laurene Powell firmly informed the author \\"that if you are ever going to do a book on Steve, you'd better do it now\\" Issacson's biography was informed by over 40 interviews with Jobs, access to friends and colleagues and a complete free hand. Sadly Jobs never got to read it since it is a generally good if rushed biography and while it is hugely sympathetic to the main protagonist it shows all facets of Jobs not least his infuriating (but understandable) perfectionism, his vindictiveness and the exercise of a level of overpowering influence on those around him. Issacson casts this as Jobs \\"reality distortion field\\" a term coined by Apple employees to describe how he created his own unique cultural/organizational norms.<br /><br />The book starts by covering his adoption by the family of mechanic Paul Jobs who enshrined in his son a love of design and brought him up near Palo Alto the epicentre of a place which was \\"just about to turn silicon into gold\\". The development of the Blue Box with Steve Wozniak's innovative design was the starting point. This showed that Jobs brilliance at another key facet namely marketing even though at the time he was a highly opinionated vegan obsessed hippy with a penchant for drugs. The rest as they say is history not least through Wozniak's uber inventive phase in Jobs garage with initially the Apple 2 computer and that seminal moment in 1984. Here the first iteration of the foundation stone of modern computing was released enshrined in the Macintosh where the mouse and GUI sealed the deal. Jobs provided the hard commercial logic behind this although its impact was far from immediate as the world shifted towards its dalliance with Bill Gates.<br /><br />Granted there are times in Issacson's book when things feel superficial. An example is the chapter on Jobs love of music that is fashioned in relation to the ubiquitous question \\"what's on your IPod\\". It shows an enduring fanaticism for Dylan and a true fondness for Joni Mitchell's song about her daughters adoption \\"Little Green\\" which clearly resonated with Jobs. The problem here and in other parts of the book however is that the text feels like an extended magazine interview and not a weighty biography which in turn is a problem with the books immediacy. In one sense it is all too raw and recent, whilst truly great biographies do require distance and the passage of time. As such Issacson certainly will not be the last word on Jobs. Alternatively the book is strong on Jobs re-takeover of Apple and later involvement in Pixar but absolutely essential in describing the development of the IPhone and IPad. Jobs frustration with attempts to partner with Motorola on a new mobile phone with their cumbersome RAZR product is a key moment. As his frustration builds he exclaims, \\"I'm sick of dealing with these stupid companies...lets do it ourselves\\" (Kindle location 8024). The world turned at this moment. Equally on the IPad the brilliance of Apple marketing and technology combined to make the Wall Street Journal excitingly comment on its launch that \\"the last time there was this much excitement about a tablet, it had some commandments written on it\\" (Location 8474). Immediately the post PC era wasborn.<br /><br />His demise at the age 56 begs the question of where Jobs would have taken Apple in the era of cloud computing and how strong is his legacy. Jobs was a restless and impatient innovator and as Issacson observes he launched products that transformed whole industries. But he also concludes that Jobs \\"Zen training never produced in him a Zen like calm or inner serenity\\". And yet in 1997 in Apple's \\"Think Different\\" campaign Jobs wrote his own obituary when in high rhetoric he stated \\"Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers .....They push the human race forward\\".at the age 56 begs the question of where Jobs would have taken Apple in the era of cloud computing and how strong is his legacy.

B005NJ2K6U|4.0|This puts a terrific &quot;spin&quot; on match 3 games. It requires you to use your brain cells in a more complex way than the others. I downloaded it 45 minutes ago and played without once looking at the clock. Runs great on the Thunderbolt. No issues at all.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Great accessory for an amateur or someone looking to foray into flash photography. It's tiny, recharges fast, runs forever on 2 AA batteries. Tilts upwards with slots at 60º, 75º, 90º. Use the Sto-fen diffuser to diffuse it on the go, when there are no ceilings.  Very easy to use, almost no controls except ON/OFF.  Just misses High Speed FP, but hey, you can't have everything!

I would have loved him the same if his name were John. But whatever.  Anyway, Stephanie Perkins is pretty much a rock star. So much so that I wrote her a fan letter after I finished Anna. Yes, I really did. And I might write her another one.  When I was reading, I kinda felt like it was written as YA for adults because I was like \\"OMG. That's how I felt about my first boyfriend.\\" The whole HUGE love and \\"he's the one\\" blah blah blah. Because you look back on it now (older,wiser, and NOT married to that guy who may or may not have been a d-bag (Max was, by the way  and laugh at yourself but also sigh a little as you remember it. All the feelings that were SO STRONG. But weren't real.  That's my only hang-up with this book. It's still a little young to be in love THAT much. But I'm a bit of a pessimist when it comes to stuff like that. I will still read the hell out of EVERYTHING Stephanie Perkins writes and I will love it.
B004JAUCQE|5.0|Dinosaur Jr. always kept the masses at bay with their feedback-drenched wall of noise, which led to a dirty little secret only known to the faithful: frontman J. Mascis has a truly beautiful voice--plus both a damn fine sense of melody and the ability to craft his feelings into the kind of simple but meaningful lyrics that can put a spark into even the darkest of hearts and minds. `Several Shades Of Why', Mascis' first solo album of all-new material, has been a long time coming and is more than worth the wait. This mostly acoustic album features vocals and lyrics so dizzyingly heart-wrenching that I feel like a voyeur at either the beginning or at the dissolution of a grand romance. Songs such as `What Happened?', `Where Am I?', and my personal favorite, `Can I?'. allow a bit of the trademark Dinosaur Jr. buzzy electric guitar sound into the mix, albeit laid underneath the acoustic leads, while others, such as the title track, embark into bluegrass territory with a mournful fiddle and a gently-plucked mandolin turning the pages of the story. Mascis enlisted the help of some indie-scene friends to provide additional vocals and instrumentation for the recording--including members of A Silver Mt. Zion, Broken Social Scene, Black Heart Procession, Band Of Horses, and Wounded Knees--but this is his album through and through, and it leaves no room for debate about the man's unimpeachable musical legacy.

B0051E9INK|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film is pretty good, from the swordfighting to the musical score by the always reliable Michael Kamen. The acting, from Christopher Lambert to Sean Connery, is also excellent. I recommend it. I'm now interested in seeing the Director's Cut of the movie. Watch for a quick appearance by stunt coordinater Peter Diamond, who choreographed the fight scenes in the first three STAR WARS films, The Princess Bride and would go on to be the stunt coordinater (& guest star, for two episodes) of the Family Channel series Zorro, which aired from 1990-1993. This film should have been rated PG-13.

0062011847|2.0|Like many other readers and long-time fans of Sir Terry, I really wanted to like, even love, this book. Unfortunately, I don't.  Snuff just doesn't feel like a Discworld novel. I found myself unable to recognise Sam Vimes and Sybil as the characters I'd grown to love over many books - Vimes especially felt very out-of-character (inasmuch as you can say that about an author  writing his own characters). The novel suffers from cumbersome narrative and dialogue: at times it feels as though characters exchange ponderous speeches rather than converse naturally. This is something I also noticed in \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\". The humour of previous books is simply not present.  Some people have suggested that the novel will be polarizing because of its dark subject matter. I am not averse to \\"darker\\" themes at all - Terry Pratchett has often tackled some of the darkest aspects of humanity with exceptional skill. However, in my opinion, the problem with this novel is not that it is \\"too dark\\" but that it is simply not very well-written.  Given the circumstances and the author's health, I feel guilty writing this, but it is my honest opinion. I've been a fan of Discworld for over 15 years, and Terry Pratchett remains my all-time favourite author. I don't think I can imagine myself *not* buying a Discworld book, for as long as Sir Terry chooses to continue writing them. But I cannot say that reading Snuff was in any way an enjoyable experience. In truth: it feels like somebody else trying to imitate Terry's style, and not being able to pull it off. And I'm genuinely sorry to have to say that.
034552554X|4.0|I had read all the reviews for this book and in intrigued me a lot. I have to admit it took me a little while to get in the book. The main character does not make herself liked. As you read the story you realize that she is this way because she is afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid of the basic human emotions, trust and love. That is because she has never experienced them her whole life. The story will touch your heart as our main character finds that there is trust and love for everyone in life.

B004V6MWFU|4.0|I was not expecting Pearl Jam but was expecting something akin to the Into the Wild Soundtrack which was brilliant and captured the spirit of that film.  I was initially put off by this album since it did not resemble Into the Wild or anything that Vedder had previously done.  After listening I sat the CD aside as one of those mistakes one makes in buying something based totally on unrealized expectations.  After a few days I pulled it out and played again and found I really liked some of the music.  I played it again and discovered that I really liked the entire album and have listened to it enough I can sing along just like I do with Pearl Jam albums or Into the Wild.  Not every Pearl Jam fan will like this but only Eddie Vedder has the guts and the talent to do this kind of CD and be entertaining - at least I have been totally entertained.  The lesson - if after listening to this and not enjoying it, give it a second or third try and it will begin to grow on you.

B005KCZRI8|5.0|I bought this on a whim, not expecting much. I guess I got lucky. There isn't a song on this thing that I don't 'really, really like' if not love. \\"Father, Son, Holy Ghost\\" is now amongst my most played albums this month. It so chill, I've gotta reach for my guitar and play along half the time I listen to it.  I'm not always in the mood for Girls' music, but when I am I have to listen to the album in its entirety. I find myself replaying the tracks 'Alex', 'Forgiveness', and the bonus track 'Martina Martinez' a few more times than the others.  Sample the songs. If you like their vibe, buy it. Great stuff, or, at the very least, good enough to impel me to come back and write a review. :)  Enjoy!

Aside from the installing the batteries, I had a blast with it! It's a little lighter in weight from what I expected. It's a little more toylike than anything, but it's still a great present. I love it and can't get over it! A must buy for any Doctor Who fan!

B003L77G38|5.0|The third season of Fringe brilliantly continues and expands on the series mythologies and overall story arc. Some of its best episodes (Entrada, The Firefly, Subject 13) manage to maintain Fringe's unique balance of weirdness, emotion, character development, and brain-twisting plot reveals, all highlighted by the superb production values, outstanding performances (when is John Noble going to snag an Emmy?) and direction. If you haven't been watching, go back and start at the top. It's worth it!  My only gripe has to do with the physical format of the Blu-ray version. WB has stuffed so many episodes onto the four discs that many Blu-ray players may experience loading problems unless you first erase the players disc cache. A fifth disc would have solved this.  Quibbles aside, my wife and I are happy to have season three to watch and savor.
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|After becoming addicted after the first season, I was very excited for the 2nd.  The first episode was pretty good, but this one really gets the season going.  What a great episode.  As someone mentioned before, there was not a great deal of gore, which was ok, but the suspense was through the roof.  This show really knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I will say the cliffhangers are painful.  I watched the 1st season straight through here on Amazon, and I would like to just wait out the end of this season and watch them straight through, but I don't think I have the willpower for that.  They should do a special extra long episode for Halloween next week, that would be great.

You spend half of the movie wondering why the bleep is the guy so stupid and the other half in anticipation of whatever big climatic scene is supposed to happen. Well it never came. Not even when Micah is supposedly thrown across the room. Seriously don't waste your hour and 25 minutes watching it. It's precious time that you won't get back and honestly, wouldn't you rather do something meaningful like...watch the grass grow?

I bought it 3 hours ago and have listened to it 4 times. It is the first Coldplay album that has made me want to dance!! It's a Monday night and I'm so hyper I don't know what to do with myself!!! Thank you, Coldplay! Your happy sound isn't what I was expecting...it's even better!!
1423140591|5.0|I was an avid reader of the first series once I heard of it. I completely devoured The Lost Hero. It was gratifying to find mortal characters from Greek mythology and theatrical drama in the book. So as not to ruin the reading of the first book I'll say no more on that subject.<br />I was surprised at the stark difference between the Roman camp and Camp Half-Blood. I was mad at myself though for not knowing more about Roman mythology beforehand. The book is amazing. It offers much to a recurring fan of Riordan or someone just interested in finding a good book to fill the time. Stick your toes in the current of the Son of Neptune and let yourself be dragged into the interesting world of Roman and Greek myth as the join forces to fight the Mother of All Villains.
0307593312|5.0|The above is a quote from this book, and well worth taking to heart. I take Jung's advice on dream images when reading a Murakami novel: don't try to unravel the underlying/hidden meaning, just stay with the images and let them move you and revel their meaning/feeling slowly.  There are images in this novel that will stay with me for years.   I'm a big fan and this is certainly one of his best novels, right there with works like The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, Norwegian Wood, and Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. Like all those works, reading the novel felt like slowly sinking into a well of dreams, and being enveloped in a mood of curiosity and off hand beauty/absurdity.   Some of the early reviews seem to be complaining about the book being repetitious, and the characters being too passive. All I can say is, this must be the first Murakami books you've read. This describes many of his books.   The passivity of the characters is actually essential to this book which deals with a world bereft of meaningful stories, and people susceptible to meaning that gives the false impression of depth [cults in this case].  Repetition is a form of making real in Murakami. The meanings are in the images, the images often begin as shadows, the novel takes those shadows and through echoes like a jazz song it breaths life into them: sometimes quite literally as in his book Hard Boiled Wonderland. I love it, but someone not used to it might find it odd.   As far as the more fantastic elements, I'll let Murakami speak for himself:   \\"I don't want to persuade the reader that it's a real thing; I want to show it as it is. In a sense, I'm telling those readers that it's just a story--it's fake. But when you experience the fake as real, it can be real. It's not easy to explain.  In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, writers offered the real thing; that was their task. In War and Peace Tolstoy describes the battleground so closely that the readers believe it's the real thing. But I don't. I'm not pretending it's the real thing. We are living in a fake world; we are watching fake evening news. We are fighting a fake war. Our government is fake. But we find reality in this fake world. So our stories are the same; we are walking through fake scenes, but ourselves, as we walk through these scenes, are real. The situation is real, in the sense that it's a commitment, it's a true relationship. That's what I want to write about.\\" - 2004    To me this captures what I resonate with in Murakami's fiction: finding reality in simple things[cooking, having a bear, off hand conversations, relationships, music, art, thinking] in a world that is surreal or hyperreal much of the time. Even the surreal when followed deeper always leads to more reality not less in Murakami, you just can't cop out along the way, like how so many other postmodern writers do, you got to go deep into the well to use a often repeated Murakami image.   So overall, if you enjoy his works like me, this is a must read and a good time :  If you've never read him, you might want to start with something shorter[I'd recommend Hard boiled wonderland].  P.S. The initial review was based on the first two books[UK edition], and now just having finished the third part [US edition] I can honestly say I felt satisfied with the ending. Murakami is very hit and miss with endings in my book, but this one worked for me. Also there are some great secondary characters here, my favorite overall might well be the private detective who shows up more prominently in the third book.

1451648537|5.0|This review is being written on an IPad. My iPhone is charging on the nightstand next to me. If I were in the mood for music, my iPod  would be sitting in its dock.  I would have bought an electronic version of this book if I had not intended to share this book with others. I make these points to accentuate the fact that Apple  products and their quirky leader are responsible for the way I live my life and how millions of other people live theirs.<br />No doubt about it,  Jobs had what amounted to a cult following. You could like the guy, hate him, think he was obnoxious or whatever.  What you probably couldn't do was ignore him unless you live in a vacuum.<br />Walter Issacson has written exceptional biographies, but this may possibly his best effort to date. This  book had me mesmerized and more importantly surprised. While he wrote the book with Jobs'  cooperation (Jobs agreed to many interviews) and Jobs provided an uncharacteristic amount of candor for someone who was, if not secretive, extremely private. Jobs also agreed to not interfere with what was written and appears to have kept his word.<br />I'm not sure if it was Jobs'  arrogance or a need to set the record straight, but this book is not  always flattering.  Quite to the contrary, he seems like a brat let loose in his own personal toy shop. He is portrayed as tyrannical when he drives his employees to the edge of sanity during his rants. For someone who converted to Budhism, he is often anything but calm. He had no reservations re: taking competitors down when he felt they had infringed on his ideas. He expressed odd opinions re: people like Bill Gates (no creativity), had a lot of disdain for the people who engineered his ouster from Apple the first time around and delighted in their failure, and had an ego that seemingly had no boundaries.<br />Jobs' life is looked at in detail. From a strong sense of abandonment from birth (his birth parents gave him up) to the striving for perfection that he acquired from his adoptive father Paul Jobs, you get the idea that Jobs was always going to prove himself.<br />He saw himself as a loving father of four, but there is even a disconnect there. When his first child was born, he denied paternity.  He had an inability to adapt to things that he didn't see for himself. Same thing with his cancer. He couldn't concede that the doctors had the best treatment plan and that may have cost him not just time, but his life as well while he fooled around with alternate treatments.<br />He was a workaholic that wasn't driven by personal wealth and while a celebrity himself (Bill Clinton sought him out via a midnight phone call to ask him how to handle the Lewinski thing), Jobs turned to mush when he engineered a meeting with his idol Bob Dylan.<br />This book is filled with details that make Jobs seem all to human and eccentric.<br />To his credit, Issacson manages to cover Jobs without trying to psychoanalyze him. Issacson also manages to capture who Jobs was and reveal a person as opposed to a corporate brand.<br />I'm still trying to process everything covered in this book that I just finished reading, but one thing is certain: Jobs wasn't all that different than most people. He was at times flawed. Unlike most people, he had an out-of-control imagination and genius. I discussed this aspect with someone who also read this book, and we both tacked up our inability to 'type' Jobs as having to do with the eccentricity of genius.<br />The more I think about Jobs, the more I liked him despite the negatives. He was a very complex person and I would have not expected any less. As for author Issacson, this book is surprisingly detailed and thorough.<br />Much like another book I recently read, this book will redefine what you think you know about the late Steve Jobs.ed from his adoptive father Paul Jobs, you get the idea that Jobs was always going to prove himself.<br />He saw himself as a loving father of four, but there is even a disconnect there.

B0043GN6XK|5.0|The music is perfect and absolutely beautiful, but let me say straight away something I will not repeat: the librettist must have been on ink or pen restrictions because systematically he makes the arias repeat over and over. Musically it is very good and even absolutely fascinating most of the time because of the variations, but extra words would have been a treat and we do not get the treat.<br /><br />Apart from that this opera has a beautiful subject and the treatment is superb. Hercules has to go and get the weapons of the Queen of the Amazons, Antiope and at the same time curb them down. In fact the myth is a clear change in sex roles in ancient Greece. Women are set in a secondary place and men take over, but that's not the whole story: they introduce some new political order: kings of a hereditary nature. We have to set these Amazons next to Medea to understand what they mean. The older order of things in Europe, before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans was in the hands of the descendants of Cro-Magnon and the Turkic people who arrived in Europe around 45,000 years ago. The Indo-Europeans are the invaders but they are no more than 20% of the population (DNA heritage is proving it today) which means they have to take over, hence to integrate themselves in the older society and to integrate the people of the older society in the new order. They have to recuperate the beliefs and religions and cultures of these people.<br /><br />And that is the rub. These people are dedicated to one triple goddess that is as old as Homo Sapiens in Europe. It is Diana in this opera and myth. It is Hecate in Medea. The triple goddess is in Greek tradition Hecate, the queen of hell from which Antiope wants to realize her vengeance, Selene the goddess of the night and the moon, a moon that is quoted once in the opera, and finally Diana who is the goddess of hunting, young animals, life and pregnant women, the main goddess in this opera on the Amazons' side systematically referred to as the triple goddess.<br /><br />Hercules is the major integrator in this Greek mythology. His various works are successive and repetitive defeats of older myths and the integration of them in the making of a demi-god, Hercules himself. On Medea's side it is Jason who has to recuperate the Golden Fleece and vanquish three mythical dangers and the armed forces of the King of Colchis, Medea's father.<br /><br />Vivaldi changes one detail and turns one of the three sisters of the Queen into the daughter of the same Queen Antiope herself and he changes her name to Martesia. Then the whole situation is ready for a perfect war, victory and integration.<br /><br />Theseus, Hercules' friend and king of Athens, is taken prisoner by Orithya, the co-ruler and sister of Antiope. On the other side Martesia is taken by the Greeks and later Orithyas herself.<br /><br />On the Greek side we have two kings, Alceste, the King of Sparta, and Telamon the king of Ithaca, are in love with the prisoner Martesia who will prefer Alceste but in order to win one of the two men must do the most heroic deed. Alceste starts first and brings back Orithya prisoner. Telamon then frees Orithya, in Hercules' back of course, for her to go back to her sister and get Theseus free, who but no one knows is in love with Hippolyta the other sister of the Queen, so that on the Amazon side we have the love affair of Theseus and Hippolyta that is confronted to the decision of Antiope to choose a prisoner to avenge her daughter with a human sacrifice to Diana, and of course she chooses Theseus.<br /><br />Without giving more details on the plot, let's say Theseus will be freed just before the axe falls on his neck, Martesia will arrive just in time to prevent her mother Antiope from killing herself and everyone will have the last word over Antiope the stubborn and Hercules and his mission. It is in fact Orithya who will hand out the weapons of her sister that Hercules must bring back to Mycenae.<br /><br />And the opera ends up with two marriages dedicated to Juno, the goddess of matrimony, and Diana. The recuperation of the Amazons' goddess is a success and the Amazons will be able to go on living in their kingdom provided they stop being warriors botherring their neighbors and two of them will be integrated in the Greek descent with the two weddings.<br /><br />Now this opera is superb because of many musical elements and I only want to quote a few. At first I was surprised by the choice of a female mezzo-soprano for Theseus, but I was convinced it was a giood choice when he was confronted to two other mezzo-sopranos, Antiope and Hippolyta, and to a soprano, Orithya in the scenes 10-12 of the second act. The result is absolutely from another world, for out of space.<br /><br />Then Alceste being a countertenor, Philippe Jazoussky, the contrast with Hercules, a tenor, Telamon, another tenor and the non-contrast with Martesia, a soprano, except the sexual harmonics of the two voices, give a tremendous dynamism to these scenes that are super tragic in many ways, dramatic to the utmost and the voices embody these characteristics. And what's more Philippe Jaroussky does not stand out as he does too often because Vivaldi's composition integrates the voice differences in the music itself and not only as a symbol of heroism: the hero Alceste being an alto and the hero Theseus being a mezzo-soprano. That was a tradition in those days but Vivaldi made it a structural necessity. He built his musical plot on the various voices that become natural in the sound architecture of the opera.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUtrimony, and Diana.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have used other alarm apps in the last. They all have had issues especially with not going off in the morning.  That just can't happen. I have been using this alarm for over 6 months now and have NEVER had a problem. It has great features and most importantly it's reliable!!
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Bought this set for Christmas 2010 after much tribulation over the price, only to find what many others have written here. While the episodes are great, there are several discs which are unreadable, and our set has one disc missing completely. Imagine yourself watching an episode with family when 10 minutes from the end the disc becomes unreadable and you have to skip to the next episode. \\"Well kids, this is what happened...\\" The seller conveniently disappeared from Amazon within days of our purchase. I can only assume the reason I got a somewhat better price is because the seller knew they had a bootleg copy. So pay full price, and check out the seller before you buy.
0440238609|4.0|I first bought these books maybe 10 years ago.   I was fascinated. Every year I reread them and it's amazing how much I missed the year before.  Well written.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Man.  I just want to keep listening to it.  There's so many layers to the music and the production style that different and subtle nuances of the album keep popping up.  I can't say this is my favorite album, but I don't want that to sound like a negative comment either!  It isn't one bit.  I'm at my third listen all the way through and still stoked for it.  I'm stoked for blasting it in my car while driving downtown, I'm stoked to show it to my friends, and I'm stoked for the memories these songs are going to create.  I think that's a beautiful thing with the band.  When you hear certain songs or certain albums, a neuron is fired and you immediately remember a time, an event, a person, or whatever in your life. This is what music is about, guys.  How does it make you feel, or how did it make you feel at one time?  What a clamorous crescendo to mark as their fifth album. Amen.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|The first album was good. Not great, but good. I lost interest in it quicker than I thought I would.   This album is worse. One listen and I've lost any interest in hearing it again. They tried going in a more blues direction. It didn't come out well. Instead, it just sounds disjointed.   Satch went WAY overboard on the guitar solos. They really don't add much to the songs. An aspiring guitarist that loves epic solos would probably like them. But, I outgrew them back in the early 90's. Now, they just come across as ego stroking by Satch.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|This movie was so boring. I've been an avid Conan fan since I was young. The first Conan with Arnold to the Savage Sword of Conan comics, and yes even Conan the Adventurer cartoons. This movie was by far the most disappointing (yes even more the Conan the Destroyer). The first 20 minutes of the film were good, to which everyone agrees. But the next hour or more of the movie was horrible. The casting of Conan wasnt that bad, however, Conan is a barbarian, this character was too soft and he talked too much. Action sequences were too far in between and even then the most you would get is fake blood splatter... really.... really??? Personally, I would say wait for cable. And for all the people with these positive reviews, why was it a dud at the box office?? Hmmmm
B005IS565S|5.0|I saw them in concert this summer and they debuted the \\"Under and Over It\\" song. It's definitely my favorite song on the album. \\"100 Ways to Hate\\", \\"If I Fall\\" and \\"Coming Down\\" are very good as well. They went full ballad mode on \\"Remember Everything\\". It's probably my least favorite song on the album.
159562015X|5.0|Please buy this book. I've done the Myers-Briggs assessment, DISC assessment, and many others. This book tied in all of the loose ends. This copy was for my sister. We also ordered a copy for every one of our management team at work.
B000002G23|5.0|The year was 1980,music was going thru some serious changes in those days and I was a kid aged fifteen at the time, when I heard this really far-out tune that came on the radio called: \\"De Do Do Do,De Da Da Da\\" and it blew my mind!I had never heard anything lyrically,or in sound and style like it before.It was an eclectic fusion of:ska,new wave and even a little funky!I was hooked from that moment. I had the pleasure of sharing this with Stewart Copeland thier awesome drummer, at a friends gig one night. These white cats are so COOL, that they crossed over to FUNKY black dudes like myself, and even influenced legendary bands such as FISHBONE. This boxed set is awesome!It contains all of THE POLICE's early underground PUNK/NEW WAVE songs such as:\\"Fallout\\",\\"Dead End Job\\",\\"Nothing Achieving\\" and \\"On Any Other Day\\".You will also find their later pop songs that were huge hits that made them the international supergroup and later ROCK and ROLL Hall of FAME inductees.My personal favorites are all here,songs such as:\\"Hole In My Life\\",\\"Does Everyone Stare\\",\\"A Sermon\\" and \\"One World(NOT THREE)\\".Of course,there are too many songs to mention,but I will say that this is a brilliant compilation put together in chronological format with an excellent booklet filled with great photos and plenty of insight on the band.This boxed set is a must for all serious fans of this band and great music period!It displays these cats talents at their best as:song writers,musicians,vocalists,performers and composers.The music is creative and diverse with sounds and styles ranging from:REGGAE,HARD ROCK,SKA,NEW WAVE,PUNK,FUNK,POP and FUSION JAZZ. Myself,being a TWO TONE fan as well as SKA music,and MOD culture,have always felt that THE POLICE fitted perfectly in that world.I highly recommend this collection for all serious students on the subject of musicology.This music will also bring back a lot of great nostalgia for the late 1970's and the early eighties.But,most importantly the music is a lot of fun and ROCKS!!!
0452289963|5.0|\\"A New Earth\\" is probably the most profound book I have ever read. It could easily be renamed \\"The Meaning of Life\\". Eckhart Tolle has magnificently worded how life works, which means us! Anyone who approaches life with an open mind will see it's truth. No one could read this book and not have their level of consciousness enhanced in some way. The book should be compulsory reading for everyone on the planet. If everyone did read it, I think we could immediately have world peace. No one could argue the truth to this book. Because we are made in the image of Truth we can authenticate Truth in our own being. Try it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Magnificent music, compelling gameplay, visually dramatic. Love it. Great for passing the time while stimulating the mind. I highly recommend this game.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Surprised by the authenticity of the music,particularly since its coming from a British actor. We really liked the vocals, piano playing, and the background orchestra. Unique.
B005YVSIZ4|4.0|Is \\"cliffhanger\\" a new buzz word?  If you've watched a show like Dexter, that is pretty normal.  I watch Dexter by the season, so I guess its different when you watch 5 episodes in a row. This series, same way =)
B00479SVBU|5.0|I received it when I expected, and I love it. I bought it because I was taking a 1,200 mile drive for business, which I did between last Thursday and Sunday, two days ago. Over 25 hours of driving I used it almost constantly, with a 32GB SDHC card loaded with about 2,900 songs. The crucial feature is the \\"bookmark\\" button on the remote, which will resume play at the time you bookmark when you restart the device; otherwise, it begins at the beginning of the last song. This isn't a problem with your Top 40 hit, but I had a collection of 50-odd BBC Essential Mixes on there, all of which were at least two hours long, and a few of which were in excess of five hours--you really appreciate not having to start at the beginning of those, provided you remember to bookmark. I wish it was the default feature, but otherwise it's a great little dealie, a very cheap solution for the smartphone/mp3 player adverse.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Games has good graphics.  challenging puzzle game.  was a nice surprise on a phone.  looking forward to more like this.
1451648537|3.0|The writing was just OK. Steve wouldn't have liked the super-cheap feel of the binding and paper--Simon & Schuster should be ashamed of themselves--Tim Cook should send them a truckload of toilet plungers.
B005FNJL7K|2.0|This is a disappointment.<br /><br />If the composer had actually devised a symphony based on some of these themes - maybe blended themes never combined on screen to see how they interacted, or developed the music in new and unexpected ways - this would have been fascinating. Sadly, that's not what we get here.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, despite the title listeners do not get a \\"symphony\\" here. Instead of the statement and musical development of themes, what this working presents is, if you will, a potted musical summary of the story. The music associated with major narrative episodes in the films is joined together to give what is ultimately an unsatisfying (because undeveloped and undramatic) listening experience.<br /><br />I am sorry to say also that the vocal performances here are no match at all for the versions available on the \\"complete recording\\" discs. Simply put the voices (both soloists and choir) are not very good.<br /><br />As a \\"taster\\" for the real thing, this is probably an OK purchase, but I think you'd be better off with the single discs for each of the movies if you wanted a concise collection.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Runs very cool. This processor is both fast and energy efficient. Win 7 WEI gave this CPU a 7.1 out of 7.9. I have a discreet GPU for my system so I can't tell the performance of the Intel Graphics 2000. One thing I know is that you can overclock the GPU on this chip. Stock cooler does the job just fine as long as you don't burn the CPU with prime95 or something. It's also 200 MHz faster than the i3-2100. I would highly recommend this processor to everyone.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I have purposely not bought a single HP film. Why? Because I knew that a box set would come out. And now one has come out. And it is exactly what I want - the complete set of films. According to the photos provided, there are extras/additional scenes to the first five films. And that is a good thing. I will be interested to see how long it takes for other versions of the complete set to come out. And maybe they will be so great that I will consider purchasing those. Or maybe WB will pull a George Lucas on us . . . Either way, I am happy to see a set come out with the theatrical versions - versions that I fell in love with at the movies. Versions I will continue to love watching many years from now. Can't wait till this comes out.

B004GYY714|4.0|Works great on the droid x, hasn't crashed and I've been using it for several hours now. Would of given it five stars but it doesn't stream the local country station and instead streams one from the midwest. If they add Dixie 105.7 or 94.5 water country it will be ten times better. Overall a good application, would recommend.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I don't usually write reviews on artist or any type of music I listen to, but I had to say something...I am speechless! Kelly might be seen as a bubble gum pop star from American Idol, but she continues to grow and expand lyrically and musically. I am not a fan of American Idol, but I have always been a fan of Kelly. There is something in her voice when she sings that inspires me, gets my booty up and shaking, and makes me smile throughout the day. She may have fallen down along her music career, but she comes back to prove she is STRONGER. I like her persistence and her diligence to be true to herself even if the \\"whole world\\" doesn't agree with her.   Of course, after writing all that, I am truly impressed with her new album, \\"Stronger.\\" After I heard \\"The War Is Over,\\" I thought she had read my own journal from a personal situation in my own life. I don't usually cry over music, but WHOA! the tears came flowing...and she made me feel STRONGER at the end of the song. I could go on about each song, but everyone perceives music differently. If you are interested in music to inspire, uplift, and keep your booty shaking...it's worth the listen.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Arrived as stated. This is a Christmas gift so won't know how it is until then. I know it will be good.
B005KCGIUY|4.0|Very good album. I do enjoy when MJK shares the mike with a female voice, and there's a fair amount of that on this album. Tumbleweed is probably my favorite song. It belongs in an old west film.  It's so neat.  If you are expecting this album to sound just like V is for, then you'll probably be disappointed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Excellent series!!!  The best tv show ever made. Don't bother getting the yearly dvds your going to love it so should get the entire 45 (DVD) box set and you'll save money.
B005WQPDJK|5.0|Did you notice the elevator scene in this latest (Oct 17, 2011) episode? The team is loaded for bear, all SWAT and everything, in the elevator headed up. The setup of that scene and sequence was intentionally meant as a production treat for the viewers. The cast and crew of TV Shows, TV Series especially, love to insert things that the fans enjoy, seeing them as jokes that they hope we will laugh at, along with them, in my opinion. That elevator scene is just such a scene. I laughed my guts outs. Replay it and watch for it if you were grabbing a handful of popcorn when that short few seconds passed you buy. They put that in intentionally for us. It had to be. It is so fun to communicate with the production group in such a way, letting us in on the inside jokes. I would not be surprised if Fillion was behind it. That would be his style, in, \\"real life\\", as they say.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|OUCH!! I haven't felt the sting of buying an album this disappointing in a LONG time! Although I wouldn't count Coldplay among my favorite bands, I keep following them and I'm interested to see what they do, but each album I've eventually bought since \\"A Rush of Blood..\\" leaves me a bit disappointed and underwhelmed. Sure there were some nice songs and some interesting moments that hinted at a band that could forego the industry hype and the \\"next U2\\" mantle they seem to have so willingly snatched and tried to shoulder. It was enough to keep me listening and hopeful...until NOW.     From the start, this album just reeks of a rock band desperately trying to stay relevant by investing in overloaded pop hooks, guest vocals and sickenly sweet songs pandering to a mainstream pop audience. In addition, Coldplay has followed the U2 playbook to a \\"T\\" and know that its a new decade and they need to reinvent their sound and make a juggernaut of an album much like U2 did with Actung Baby. In fact the attempts to do so are shameless...from the street graffiti patchwork style album cover, odd foreign name for the album and more club oriented rock songs. Sadly, these comparisons only reveal how much better of a band U2 were on Actung Baby than Coldplay.  Where Actung Baby was bold, risky and edgy this album is so glossy and smooth the record execs themselves couldn't have designed a more sugar coated album for mass consumption.     The first song, isn't even a song, but instead a tiny little snippet of intro music that does nothing for the song or album (by the way, there's two or three more of those between songs that inexplicably given separate song titles). Hurts Like Heaven hurts the ears in its attempt to slam you into its wall of electro-pop/rock which along with Chris Martin's annoyingly distorted and buried vocals after WAYYYYY too much sugar and caffeine. Over and Over throughout this album Coldplay keeps playing that same card of a short bit of pointless atmospheric music followed by a BOOM of electric noise and bass. I've figured out that the reason Chris Martin's vocals are so buried is that he's not saying anything of substance and the vocal melodies just aren't that strong on most of the songs. So what do you do? Pile on more production of course!     The sound of the album does work on a few of the songs. Adding to my disappointment is that \\"Every Teardrop..\\" was the first Coldplay song that really grabbed me since \\"In My Place.\\" Every Coldplay album seems to have this one defining song and this or possibly \\"Paradise\\" is it. It works perfectly as a blend of a great dance/rock beat, effective synth chords and good innovative guitar playing. Paradise is another song that works well and sounds much better on the album when you can really hear that booming electonic bass sound. I also like Major Minus with its edgier acoustic guitar riff. That's about the only interesting high points of this album. Coldplay tries to strip a few of the songs down to their old simple acoustic sound on a few ballads. However, lyrics and melodies are so overly poppy and sweet they could have been written by Disney for Miley Cirus or Kelly Clarkson to sing.     I have kept the hope alive to hear something truly creatively and artistically on par with \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" Not Coldplay constantly trying to be U2. Only U2 can be U2, so just be Coldplay! Stop the hero worship! Brian Eno's production with U2 was great, but that was 20 years ago! Find your own producer, your own \\"Eno\\" that makes Coldplay shine!    I just watched the Pearl Jam 20 documentary the other night which puts even more prospective on this album. Pearl Jam consciously shunned pop radio, the big productions and trying to be the biggest band in the world and they've come out the other side with their intergrity as one of the most respected and loyaly followed bands still going today. Unfortunately, Mylo Xyloto shows that Coldplay has invested in the ever fickle pop audience. Although many fans may initially be seduced by the pop rush of this album, its substance that really sticks with fans and makes a great album. I certainly don't see this album still resonating and being talked about 20 years from now and given all the rerelease fanfare like Actung Baby is right now. Unless Coldplay someday decides to stand on their own, they will remain only in the shadows of greater bands and have at least one less fan in me.
B000UX6THK|1.0|I bought this on an Amazon Daily Special, so fortunately am only out $35.  But I fail to see the rave reviews.  Even if one looks at it as a spoof it's just not making it for me.  Writing sucks, acting's terrible (though maybe it's good actors pretending to be bad?); it's so weird it's hard to tell.  For the record, I am a fan of and have bought Boston Legal, Everwood, the Closer, Southland, and even Ally McBeal.  So, maybe this show is just above my level of intelligence.

1609611543|5.0|I started eating gluten free a number of months ago based on a suggestion from my doctor. It made such an amazing difference in my health, so I was especially interested to read Wheat Belly.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book. The wheat that we eat today is very different then the wheat our ancestors ate. It has been changed, through breeding, into a very different plant. The protein make-up of the wheat we do eat is can cause blood sugars spikes worse then table sugar - and that includes whole wheat. Wheat, if you are intolerant, can cause inflammation which can worsen many conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and more. I personally experience a big improvement of my asthma, and some stomach issues I had for years are now completely gone.<br /><br />Dr. Davis is a cardiologist and has amassed a large amount of information on what, gluten and disease. There are some great recipes as well.  This book is highly recommended.
B0057ZEMF2|5.0|This CD is a true feast for both the ears and the soul. A joyful and serene exploration of the bonds between the classical Indian music forms and the flamenco. Thereby following the legacy of the gypsies which originally came from Rajastan bringing the rhythms and melodies of India to Europe. (A legacy also explored in the collaborations between Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin).<br /><br />Amazing how Anoushka Shankar's musical universe has grown from her debut with competent but tentative interpretations of her father's music. To highly succesful experiments with the fusion of the classical tradition and modern day electronica on [[ASIN:B000AV2G6A Rise]] and [[ASIN:B000RPCEV6 Breathing Under Water]]. Constantly developing and expanding both her compositoric and improvisational skills.<br /><br />This album is beautifully diverse and innovative. Among the highlights - though all tracks are exquisite - are the guitar/sitar duet \\"Boy Meets Girls\\" with Pepe Habichuela and the infectious titletrack.<br /><br />Marvelous and essential for all lovers of world music, the beauty of the sitar and the spirit of musical adventure.
1466276177|4.0|Wilkie Collins is great fun to read. His philosophies are somewhat (and refreshingly) liberal for his time, particularly those in regard to servants, foreigners and women. His stories are sprinkled with just a dash of wit and satire, yet his characters and their motives are crystal clear and believable. In this, arguably one of the first mystery novels, (Poe began it all, after all, did he not?) the plot revolves around a stone, a great gem that has been stolen from an Indian idol. A birthday present to our heroine, it is stolen the same night it is given, and through a series of changing narratives the mystery is uncovered. It's a clever twist of plotting to make the hero the villain and then the hero again, but how it comes about I will not say. No one likes to have a mystery spoiled. The Moonstone is a thoroughly enjoyable read. I highly recommend it.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|Pretty cool game, just way too many mb's for what it is. Clear out some space on the SD card for this one.
1593082800|5.0|This is truly a haunting story of doppelgangers, deception, heartbreak and cruelty. And yet there is something very gentle about it as well. Collins spares nothing of his wit and satirical weaponry on the deserving, but always treats his heroes and heroines with the utmost respect. It's a complex story, and in interesting insight into marriage laws and relationships in the (middle of the) Victorian era. It's a tragedy, but with a happy ending. Wilkie Collins is truly one of my favourite authors.

B005NJ2K6U|1.0|Update:  I changed my review from two stars to one star.  Game play is not bad but when I finished the first level there was no way to exit the screen.  Little \\"Advance\\" token in the lower right was glowing but again non-responsive.  Wouldn't recognize capacitive buttons or any taps on the screen.  Had to reset again!  Uninstalling  -----------  First, this app locked my Vibrant when it stated. I thought I was going to have to pull the battery. Ended up holding the power button until it rebooted. That's probably the third time I've done that in 16 months.   Then the tutorial. Sheesh. Couldn't get out of it, couldn't figure out how to start the game without going into the tutorial every time.   When a game starts out like that it's probably ab omen of things to come.

B005ELZKWS|4.0|I wanna be like Sammy when I grow up, if I end up being lucky and reaching his age... people complain about the lyrics, but this is Sam being Sam... he hasn't mellowed out he still sings like 20 years ago, I mean it, I would love to reach that age and still have his flair and passion for life, sex and fun things, but well this is not a Sammy review it's a chickenfoot III review so let's focus on that.<br />Their debut album was the rock shocker of the year for me (2008 was it?) I thought it was going to end up being a one album band so I just can't explain how excited I was after finding out another one was being baked. It is not (only) about the music, don't you just love it when you see people doing what they like with passion? This is what I talk about, I like seeing Sam and Mike together bringing sonic memories and also creating some new memorable moments, Chad, he just brings the funk to the equation and he gets along with Mike so well and create the perfect rhythm section (No disrespect to Mr Flea of course) and what can I say about Joe, I am thrilled by the versatility and team play he shows in this album. Add these dudes together and you have a 4 star no filler (perhaps one) album that instead of repeating the first equation sounds like a totally new approach.<br />I must be honest I like their first one a bit better maybe because of it's straight ahead rock formula, while this one finds the guys going beyond and experimenting the end result is an album that even if I personally don't like as much as the first one I feel it is just as good music wise... an intelligent investment in your musical heath. And just one extra note, this is the kind of album that makes me want to keep on buying physical media, the 3D pictures provided are just awesome and fun.<br />I will sound greedy but I am now looking towards their 3rd album whatever they decide name it.<br />These old guys rock!
1451648537|2.0|I have read business books on and off for many years, and only in the past few years have I given up on most of them. This book is anotherw\ example of why I did so. Not ISaacson's best writing by any means, the book seems like a last minute attempt by a savvy, intelligent Steve Jobs to leave his message behind. It fails to do so, and only gives us a picture of the man that makes him cetainly more human, but also highly unlikeable. I am afraid that beyond the fans, this one will end up in the discount area of B&N quickly, like so many of its' ilk. Steve, you may have deserved better, or maybe you should have left well enough alone... time will tell. Still, I would wait for the price to go down, or skip altogether.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|What is up with the low reviews on Amazon? It's like there are two different groups of people on here versus the Market. At least the Market seems to have reviews that seem more fair. Anyway, I have the first Gem Spinner and I really enjoyed it, enough to beat the whole game. The game does get more challenging the further you progress. There's even some strategy involved in the last set of levels. I've also been playing this game with no hiccups and I think it's nice that the developers really tried to polish it from the first one.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Wish I could've been at the live performance - but thanks to this CD, you can feel like you were there!  Such a pleasure to listen to great musicians having a great time playing great music!
B004W2UBYW|1.0|I am so sorry I shelled out too much money for this, for the most part, BORING book. If you are interested in the history of every device Apple has made then this is for you. If you wanted to be captivated by the personality and struggles of someone who has achieved so much, well, good luck. I have no idea whether it is true, but Jobs is portrayed as an egotistical, not-all-that likable, pretty unchartitable man. If I had stuck by my \\"rule\\" for reading fiction--if I don't care about any of the characters, I bag the book at page 50-- I would have laid this book down and not finished it. As it is, I ended up skimming through a lot of it.
0553381407|5.0|Simply put, this book changed my life - and the lives of my siblings and their spouses, and my spouse's life, and the lives of all of those surrounding us who were impacted by my not understanding, nor knowing how to handle, the effects of my toxic parent. I would, and do, recommend this book a thousand times over.
B003A02W0I|4.0|It was a good read though and on top of that I actually finished it. Sometimes its hard for me to finish books. At times I get so distracted. Anyway that is my issue, hope you enjoy it!
B005J4TLN4|1.0|Wow, this movie was a huge dissapointment.  I was told that this movie was both very funny and the special effects were top notch.  I'm not sure which claim was more wrong.<br /><br />The movie simply is not funny.  Here's an example of an attempt at humor:  When trying to decide what to do about the dead alien one guy says \\"Yo, we should call Simon Cowell because this alien's got talent.\\"  The only thing vaguely funny about the movie was the kid's accents.<br /><br />The special effects were about on par with the movie alien, which was released in 1979.<br /><br />I don't know what someone could possibly be looking for in a movie where they would be even remotely satisfied.
0062101897|5.0|First of all, WOW! This book is massive! It's so big and full of info and never-seen-pics. I was really impressed, worth the money for a true HP Fan.
1416550550|5.0|I just finished reading The Forgotten Garden, and I cannot get it out of my mind.  It was sad, beautiful, and haunting.  I agree with the reviews that were slightly disappointed in the ending - it was almost as if the author wanted to tie up things happily and forced it a little - but it in no way diminished the experience of the entire book.  I find my little daughter even more valuable after reading it!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Long, dense, and absolutely the definitive look at an American icon. Avoiding the dreaded \\"Disney Bio\\" of a pristine and saintly genius, this is a probing and insightful look at a real person - genius, devil and driven inventor.   Simply put; if you are looking for some relief in this age of hype and mediocrity, Jobs in the hands of a consummate biographer is the book of the year.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|all of the people complaining about FREE apps are ridiculous. So what if you have a similar game, this is FREE FFS. Complain to Amazon, don't make the app look bad by reviewing it as one star
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Along with U2, Dave Matthews Band, Phish, Arcade Fire and The Decemberists...Coldplay are one of the best bands making music today.  This newest release ranks up there along their best work...Get it...you will be glad you did.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|All in all, I would say that it's Tom's most-inspired and best album since Bone Machine.  I highly recommend it!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I installed this on my DROIDX and have not had any problems with it.  I saw some reviews that were based upon the forced delivery of this app...stop being losers and rate the product legitimately.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This game literally puts an awesome twist on the match three concept. Jewels are in cells which the game has you drag entire cells, spin a cell of jewels, and connect 3 or more jewels to make a match. But that not all the goal is to connect jewels with light behind them to get water drops which add to you star ranking.   In all its hard to explain but if you like match three games that actually do something unique get this game. Production values are through the roof. I would of missed out on this gem if I didnt get it free, but its easily worth $2. EVO 3D
B0053B347M|5.0|I have three USB ports on my Samsung LED TV and I have these bias lights connected to each one. The lights power on and off with the TV. This solves the problem of having a separate remote or switch to control the light.  There seems to be a sweet spot around 6\\" from the wall that provides the most even and focused light dispersion. Too close and you will see orbs on the wall with darker areas between them. Too far and the light will become unnoticeable.  I'm very happy with the improved contrast and reduced eye strain made possible by these bias lights.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|i see alot of comments on here sayin it takes alot of time for it to load and people need a memory stick to use this bluray, i use a ps3 thats connected to the internet and the first scene pops up in secs and actully shows u the location of where u r at and even gives you the time and temp. thats outside which i thought was pretty cool, u simply press ok to get to the main menu, theres a boat load of extras and found out there are 3 versions of this movie, reg, extended and uncut and extended, but to watch the uncut and extended one u need to type in a few numbers and it pops up, i watchd that version last nite and i have to say its prob the best one, they should of used this version bc it explains and shows you alot more of the film and whats actully going on, but if they did use this film they couldnt have made part 3 which was a joke on its on and should of never been made, i strongly think people should watch the extended uncut version of this film and you will know what im talking about, expec. at the end of the film,
0756404738|5.0|What can I say,Patrick Rothfuss, is just awesome..Love this book..cannot wait until the 3rd book is out..Great buy at Amazon.
0439796636|5.0|War Horse follows the story of Joey, a farm horse, throughout World War I. It's a great story of triumph, perseverance, love and devotion. Centered around World War I, Joey finds himself fighting for both sides and losing loved ones along the way. It's wonderful for both boys and girls, as everyone can relate and is more empathetic towards animals. This is a great book for middle schoolers and would be great to use in the classroom! I highly recommend this book, though, for all ages.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've been using this app on my DROID X for about a year and never had a problem.  It keeps me reading away from my Kindle.
B004SUSZB4|5.0|It is so amazing that someone as young as this author can have such wisdom! If you don't cry through this book I don't know what to tell you. Not only did I cry for Holly and Gerry and the wonderful love they had, but for my kitty who just turned 14 and I know will be leaving me soon - I don't want her to go! Also I cried for my own wasted life and the soul mate that I have never found. Those who are so lucky to find that person may not know how lucky they are and again they may know and I am sure losing that person would leave an awful void in ones life.   Thank you for such a heartfelt life and may you find your soul mate in life.

B003F3NE1Q|5.0|I have been a Greys fan since 2009 when I first bought Season 1. I used to spend my weekend having a Grey's-athon. Season 6 is very entertaining and the show just gets better and better. And I love that I actually learn from it too. Cant wait to get the next season!
0765365278|5.0|the book is just great..I really enjoy Brandon Sanderson's books...It has kept me turning page after page..He know how to keep the reader asking for more..thank you Brandon...And I will be getting more books from Amazon..
B00003CXB4|4.0|They added a new song?! Why?! Who does that?! Ugh.<br /><br />The original would absolutely get 5 stars from me. It is a classic. I bought the 2 Disc Platinum Edition for my kids, so they could enjoy The Lion King for the first song. Imagine my surprise when there is some new hokey song in the beginning. It just ruins it for me. It irritates me that my kids will likely go around singing \\"The Morning Report\\" instead of \\"Hakuna Matata.\\" Why on earth would you mess with something as epic as The Lion King? Bad move there. Hopefully the future releases will omit that awful change.<br /><br />You can play it in the original version, but it isn't easy to get to. It is actually quite complicated to watch the movie in its original version. Instead of asking when you select \\"play\\" which version you would like to see (as many DVDs do), you have to go into the settings and change the version there. The original should be the default.
0786958731|5.0|I am a huge Drizzt fan and have been eargerly awaiting the arrival of this game.  I love it. The minatures are awesome.  The monster selection is significantly better than castle ravenloft.  I have played 3 adventures so far.  Drizzt's character is awesome.

B003ES61EE|2.0|The Lens Pen is a nice product and performs well.  However, I typically keep it loose in a backpack on inside a case with my camera, and when I retrieve it the cap is invariably lost somewhere in the bag. Often times, the felt tip will have fallen off along with the cap. Other than this issue it works fine, but this is a major annoyance and I am afraid that the felt tip's life will be seriously decreased due to this.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Nice &quot;spin&quot; on the normal match 3 game. Thanks to the developer for allowing the game to be a faotd.
0385534639|2.0|Not very often am I unhappy with a book, that has so much hoopla around it. Honestly I think it is hard to read, and it just drones on and on about an event that is going to happen. There are too many characters who you try to keep up with, and they have no importance in the whole picture. I try to read at least one book a week, but this thing is like,trying to move through molasses.
B005GUQIDC|5.0|This album is beautiful! The song \\"Settle Down\\" immediately attracted me to Kimbra's music and I've been listening to at least one track of hers every single day! Well-made music and such phenomenal vocal talent. I hope she comes to the States soon :)
0553801473|1.0|I suppose I could rant and rave about how long it took to write the fifth book of the series, or complain on much of the book was just plain fluff, but as an avid reader I would rather have quality than quantity and that sometimes bits and pieces of backstory are required.  However, of the five books so far, this was by far the most disappointing book.<br /><br />The characters that I missed so much in book four have become boring in the fifth book. And while I am envious of GRRM's ability to create such imagery with words, it's too bad he couldn't have applied some of that creativity to increasing the storylines of his main characters.  New points of view are used as filler material but offer little or no value to the storyline.<br /><br />If you haven't read or listened to this book yet, I recommend waiting till the next one comes out (assuming we live that long), you're not really missing much.

B000089RVX|5.0|It's a true gem, one of the best album of the decade.\  Buy it as soon as you can. Amy lee is the best and with ben moody it rocked
B0032KLAKE|5.0|(I watched this as an instant video)  Norton and Gere work wonderfully together and I can't imagine their roles being played by anyone else; each actor brought something wonderful to their character. Silly as it may seem, every time I watch this movie Aaron always manages to tug on my heart strings and the subtle looks of fondness Marty has for the 19 year old boy deepens the level of endearment.   Sometimes I fight with myself whether to finish the movie but I always do and I'm always left with the same, powerful feeling I had the first time I enjoyed this film.  A lot of movies do a great job at getting you to do a 180 on your point of view of the characters for the second viewing, but it's only a small handful that gets you to do a 360... damn you little Aaron.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|There is something about this album that makes me love Kelly even more than I already did. Her voice is stronger, richer. I have bought every album by her and enjoyed them all. She is so unique. Her voice, her style. This album is great track after great track. All of this is because of her voice. She treats it like an instrument and convinces you whatever she is singing about. Like in Mr. Know it All, when she just kills it. My favorite tracks are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17 but every track is great. Let Me Down and What Doesn't Kill You(Stronger) are sure to be radio hits. Dark Side shows a side to Kelly anyone can relate to if your imperfect. Hello is fun and describes what being single feels like. You Can't Win describes what life feels like sometimes. Definitely recommend this for people who love great singing and pop music.
030726999X|5.0|I'm upset that this is the last book of the series. I had to send it back though because my finace and sister ordered it for me for my birthday and I had no use for 2 books.<br />I wish there was a paperback version available, as I find hard covers too cumbersome.

0312576463|4.0|First off, this was my first book of Franzen that I read so can't comment on whether he's just re-written his previous books. Without any expectations I have to say I really enjoyed it. It took me a while to get into it. and yes certain sections in the middle were boring and dragged on (the birds, the war); but I still couldn't put it down and even in it's intellectual setting and some over the top scenes, I liked it for it's honest and unflattering descriptions of how many people live. Anyway, it reminded me of a modern \\"Buddenbrooks\\" and despite its flaws, I couldn't stop reading. That's why it's got 4 stars.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Simply excellent album. I loved all the songs! I really enjoyed the new melodies/styles explored by ColdPlay in this album. *I am in \\"Paradise\\" listening to the album :)
B005B19UPE|3.0|I had been hearing a lot about this book when the movie came out and thought I would check it out.  I read it yesterday.  Yes, it's a pretty quick little read.  In the first part of the book the action shifts between telling Sarah's story (1942, young Jewish girl and family are taken from their home, leaving their younger child behind, and eventually sent to concentration camp) and Julia's story (modern day American journalist married to jerky Frenchman, dealing with typical chick-lit family issues).  Roughly the second half of the book is all Julia's story and the research about Sarah and her family.<br /><br />I won't go into a lot of plot details because it is difficult to do so without giving too much away.  I thought Sarah's story was very compelling and like others here, I wish the entire book had been about her.  Julia is whiny and irritating, her husband is such an a$$ I can't see what on earth she sees in him (but the sex is great, apparently), his family treats her like an outsider despite years of marriage, and they don't take her career seriously.  I felt the book was very light and seriously lacking in telling Sarah's story; it's so perfunctory that it really annoyed me, and the contrast between what Sarah's family went through, and the aftermath of her later life, and Julia's fairly easy life, just didn't work for me.  Additionally, the author's almost constant swipes at the French people and their behavior in the modern story were strange.  It seemed to me that if Julia felt SO out-of-place and misunderstood and disliked by her relatives and the French people at large, she would have packed it in years ago!  Her husband is one of the most unsympathetic male characters I've ever seen, even by chick-lit standards.  The only bright spot is her 11-year-old daughter Zoe. Personally, if I were Julia, I'd have taken Zoe back to America simply so that she wouldn't absorb her father's crappy attitude and behavior.<br /><br />To sum up, I think those who are interested in this subject matter should look elsewhere for a serious examination of it.  This book is very light and insubtantial and the story of Sarah and those like her deserves a much better book.terested in this subject matter should look elsewhere for a serious examination of it.

B0050CQY1W|1.0|Our expectations from our \\"stars\\" are so low.  I can't image anyone actually enjoying this music and this is another example of how someone name sells instead of their talent. We must demand more. Black music has always left its mark on the world -- how does this compare to the very talented artist that has come before. Very disappointing.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Christmas is an absolutely beautifully recorded and sung album by the velvety rat pack voice of Michael Buble.  The arrangements are stellar featuring big band and full orchestra backings by some of the best musicians in the business with a great deal of input from Michael himself and genius producer David Foster. Additional production by Bob Rock gives an especially rewarding re-work of Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You. Michael slows the tempo way down and turns Mariah's festive version into a very romantic and longing song of desire and passion.  What a great version of one of the best Christmas songs written in the last 20 years!    Also quite amazing is Michael's version of Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).  Here he wisely  sticks to Darlene Love's original arrangement though the brass and drums are recorded so well and sound so bright it might almost make you forget her original version which is also fantastic. Buble modestly said that he might not have her pipes but he sure made up for it with his own punch and swagger.  Another classic is given the Buble treatment and the listener cannot help but get drawn into the singers desire to get his baby home as soon as possible.    There are an amazing 15 songs on this version which includes all traditional songs except for one original written by Michael and his piano player Alan Chang, Cold December Night, another romantic and well sung ballad that would go quite well with an eggnog sitting by the fireplace.  There are spicy versions of Holly Jolly Christmas and Jingle Bells as well as an awesome duet with Shania Twain on White Christmas that borrows a great deal from the Drifters version featured in the Home Alone movie.    Michael sings a hauntingly beautiful version of Ave Maria where he really shows the richness and clarity of his amazingly beautiful diction and singing technique.  Remember this is a guy who closes out many of his concerts by putting the microphone down on the stage and singingthe last song without amplification.  Silent Night features a tender brass arrangement at the beginning that segues into a beautiful children's choir that sings along with Michael.    Michael Buble's Christmas ranks right up there with the greatest holiday records of all time by Elvis Presley, Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis.  This album is immaculately sung and well produced and is a timeless masterpiece for the ages.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|This movie series is super fun for me since I have loved the comics growing up but the overall actual movie here is a struggle for me.  The transformers are sweet the fighting by them is intriguing and even the back story is great, but the ridiculously shallow vanity of Sam makes me struggle and then although easy on the eyes to some degree compared to Sam, his girlfriend really was not a huge treat as she really plays dumb and empty  which may have been her role ),  and the whole I am your hero and will keep you safe is very much injured by the fact that in the beginning part of the movie Sam is absolutely pathetic when it comes to reality and functional work.  The Machine vs Machine violence saves the moving and redeems it from the pit( making it actually fun to see  but much of the main character acting is very so so to mediocre plot/character development and essentially brings the movie down in a big way.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|This was our Spouses Org. Book Club pick for this month. All the witches and vampires and magic made it especially good for October. I'm not sure, okay I'm 100% sure, I wouldn't have read this book on my own because one reviewer described it as Adult Twilight. Ew. Ew. Ew.<br /><br />Hooowever, the woman who picked the book is smart and amazing, so I thought it would probably be a good read. And it was. Though I have to warn you, it moves so. slowly. The action  really only gets started at the last 20% of the book. And yes, the vampires have their typical speil about Vampire Culture and their lust for blood and their overprotective, moody tendencies. And yes, Diana Bishop is a little bit whiny and throws a lot of tantrums and then swoons and falls into her lover's arms. Which really, really irritated me. Why do books have to revolve around a moody male lead who pouts and the whiny girl eventually gives in!?<br /><br />But, it you stick with it until the last 20%, the book picks up and gets interesting.<br /><br />And the dialoge is not nearly as cheesy. And the book is not poorly written, though at almost 600 pages, it could have used a good once-over from a mean editor.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Twilight, you'll love this book. If you're a fan of history, you'll like this book. Hello, Oxford library and old books.<br /><br />Just don't try to read it all at once.
0439023521|5.0|At this point, there's not much else to say about Suzanne Collins' international best-seller THE HUNGER GAMES. The book is a hit, and a movie is coming out in spring 2012. It is loved by young adults (its target) and adults everywhere, and has won numerous awards. I can easily say that the book deserves all its accolades, it lives up to its hype, and I'm glad I read it.<br /><br />For me, the plot is just like the movie and Stephen King short story THE RUNNING MAN, where, in a bleak future, contestants are thrown into an arena and must fight to the death. The last person alive wins and receives numerous awards. Collins makes her version of the story work by creating a future in which America ceases to exist. The country of Panem has taken its place and has 12 districts. Every year, each district must send two children to compete in the Hunger Games where they will fight to the death. This is required to punish each district for a revolt against the capital years ago.<br /><br />The power of the novel comes in the characters and their every day lives. Katniss is 16 and lives in District 12. She and friend Gale spend their days hunting and selling their goods on the black market. Katniss is chosen for the Games and must leave Gale and her younger sister Prim behind. The lurid spectacle before the games is fascinating, as each player is worshiped like a celebrity. Once the games begin, there is heartbreak and violence as Katniss struggles to stay alive while trying not to get too close to others playing the game, including Peeta, a boy from District 12.<br /><br />I am so glad I read this novel, and already have the second book in the series and will soon start it. Collins writes in away that captures your imagination and she doesn't let go until the final word is written.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|But I wish there was a way to gift it to my family and friends who are still paper bound.    How I love thee, let me count the ways:  1. Declutter, don't organize your clutter.  I know this is a basic concept, but not one that I was able to grasp (as my favorite store is the container store).  2. The very practical instructions given in bite size pieces... I have ADHD, and finally there's a book for me.    3. The ode to January.  I love the idea of the peace of January.    4. The contemplation on couches.  I know that I still want one, but it's nice to not have to have one.  5. The best part, the vicarious thrill of imagining this minimalist life, and realizing that it will some day soon be mine.    6. the psychological space this book gives me.  So thanks for it, but I would love a small book with the same information for my family and friends.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|Zooey Deschanel is quite the charmer. Her acting is adorable and her voice is silk.  So how does this new Christmas album from She & Him rate in the endless potpourri of holiday staples?  Well, overall, I'd have to say that some of these renditions may very well knock those 1950's classics off their throne. Not every song is classic, but those that are REALLY are.  Here's my rundown:<br /><br />THE UNDENIABLY BRILLIANT:<br />- The Christmas Waltz. I've never been a huge fan of this song, but She & Him nailed it absolutely perfectly. Zooey's voice has never sounded better, the production is subtle but enhancing. I love love love this song. Will be playing it all Christmas '11 and probably forever after that.<br /><br />- Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I love how they made this classic even slower and more romantic. It's an amazing mixture beautiful, relaxing, and extremely sexy.<br /><br />- Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree. A simple kick-snare beat and lush guitar mixes flawlessly with Zooey's voice to provide a live-like effect. It sounds like she's performing right in your living room!<br /><br />- The Christmas Song. There's a lot of tough competition out there with this song, but She & Him's version is up there with the best.<br /><br />THE LOVELY:<br />- I'll Be Home for Christmas. Like \\"Have Yourself...\\" the tempo is slowed down a bit for this one too. It doesn't translate quite as well, but still a stunning rendition.<br /><br />- Christmas Wish. We get to hear more of \\"Him\\" on this track, and though he's no Zooey, it provides gorgeous contrast to the rest of the album and is a lovely merry relaxer.<br /><br />- Sleigh Ride. Unexpectedly mellow for this usually upbeat number, but still works well.<br /><br />- Christmas Day<br /><br />- Blue Christmas<br /><br />THE EH:<br /><br />- Baby It's Cold Outside. The Christmas song Zooey is probably most famous for (from the movie Elf) is actually the worst track on the album IMO. For some reason the tempo is too fast and there is absolutely no chemistry between the singers. It sounds like they're so worried about singing on cue that they completely left out the story behind the song.

B005AKFXZW|4.0|I loved this book! The descriptions of all the circus tents were magical. The circus was so well described, you could almost smell the popcorn and carmel! The characters and scenes are lovely. I was expecting a Prestige type story with this book, but the direction it takes is more along the lines of The Illusionist because of the love stories involved. I've heard it referred to as the next Harry Potter or Twilight. No. It's not either of them. It's more Moulin Rouge meets magician love story.  Definitely worth a read.
B002R25THI|5.0|For me this is a classic movie.  It's fun to watch in the dark with all of the lights off.
B001HN6922|5.0|Like a lot of other reviews, I was counting the days down with my 4-year old and 2-year old.  This was the first time he marked the days on the calendar and we went.  We loved it.  We saw it three times.  As for the violence, come one, really?  I hate guns and don't have them, but this movie was in context, it was a James Bond movie with talking cars.  No nudity, no language, and there were several messages that I have talked about with my kids.  The animation was great, the sound was great, it was well produced - is it Pixars \\"best\\" no, but a lot better than other things on the market over the last few years.  I have no problem having my kid look to Lightening and Matter as heros - infinitely better than Shrek or Kung Fu Panda.  As far as violence, I won't let them watch \\"The Incredibles\\" because though I liked the movie, it is not appropriate yet.  Now let's talk about the animation genre.  It is not just for kids.  In my opinion, what made Pixar great is the weaving of adult interest with kid friendly story telling.  Toy Story 3 - which I thought was horrible, and my kids have never played with or shown interest in a buzz toy since, was totally an adult movie.  Just because something is animated doesn't mean it is for kids.  Have you seen cable animation lately?  I like the Cars franchise including the short clips we watch on the new Disney Roku channel.  As with everything, parents needs to be engaged with their kids, talk about the messages they see, and make decisions.    From time to time, we go to the movies for entertainment.  Cars 2 is very entertaining with lots of eye candy.  My kids have not increased their violence but they love playing with their Cars.
0671027344|5.0|Oh my gosh! The Perks of Being a Wallflower can be uplifting, and yet kind of depressing. After you read this book you'll be amazed at how much this book will change your view on somethings. Now, I dream of myself in Charlie's position having to go through all of this... WOW is all I can say.
0765357151|5.0|A great short story that stands the test of time.  As soon as you read the first page or two your hooked. It's incredible how Hollywood recently made such a bad film from a such a great short story.  Forget the movie, with the bad fx and acting and read this wonderful book, from the writer who gave us Nightmare at 20,000 feet (the gremlin on the plane wing), Steel (now Real Steal, with Hugh Jackman), Prey, A Stir of Echoes and What Dreams May Come, to name a few.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I can't hide my excitement to have this cd when if i first read its ads in amazon. I rushed to a local music store on the first day of its release and became the first one to buy the cd in that store. The track listings in this cd are great! I love Michael's version of Mariah Carey's \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You\\" and the classic \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\". This cd is really a must have for Holiday CD Collectors out there.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I am not exactly a Kubrick scholar, so my knowledge of this film is somewhat limited compared to that demonstrated by some reviewers.  That said, for the casual viewer, The Shining is a singularly unique viewing experience.  The third act is among the most harrowing in the history of cinema; the use of the then-new technology of the steadycam is incredibly effective at heightening the tension and surreality of the isolated setting; and Jack Nicholson's manic performance is simultaneously over-the-top and chillingly realistic...madness made manifest.  Technically speaking, the Blu-ray transfer is very crisp, and the sound (always important in a Kubrick film, but especially important in this one) is SUPERB.  30 years after I first saw it, The Shining remains one of the definitive American horror films, and the Blu-ray edition is a wonderful representation of the work.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|For those who have always wondered about \\"is there other life out there\\", Avatar is the movie that will have you really wondering. Pandora is the name of the planet, and the imagery used in this movie is so breathtaking. It's about a former marine who is paralyzed whose twin brother is participating in the \\"Avatar Program\\", but dies and the program wants this ex marine to fill in for his deceased brother. The avatar program is a mixing of human dna and the natives dna to form an avatar. It is a living and breathing creature, and when it's human operator \\"sleeps\\", they are operating the avatar and are mingling with the natives. It's a non stop action movie and James Cameron definitely created another winner with this movie. If you like Cameron's work on Titanic, you will like his work with Avatar.

0525423281|4.0|Lola Nolan is a seventeen year old girl, who lives in San Francisco, California with her two dads. Lola is super into fashion and she wears wigs and crazy outfits. And she has a tattooed - no plans for college - boyfriend who's years older than her -- Max.   First of all, have you read Anna and the French Kiss? If you said no, well -- I know everyone says this but you have to get it. I mean, you can read Lola and the Boy Next Door without reading Anna and the French Kiss first but you will enjoy it even more because the main characters of Anna are friends with Lola.   Lola's parents, Nathan and Andy, were how I wish most parents in the YA books were. They were realistic; they grounded her, gave her curfews, great advice, and they supported her in her weird clothes and they didn't like \\"the boyfriend\\", Max. Which made for some funny scenes. Her mom -- well, is a mess but she's on Lola's life. Sort of. Not the best mom, though.   I liked Cricket Bell, the love interest. He's a year and a month older than Lola. I loved his style, the rubber bands and the writings in his hand. It was cool to see someone actually in college. I hope we get a trend here in the YA books of that, (characters in college) because there's not enough. Lola had history with Cricket but then some stuff happened and he moved away. Which gave Lola time to \\"forget\\" him and move on.   I loved Max. I liked him more than Cricket! Okay, don't kill me but seriously, let's make a list to explain why:   - he's in a band.   - he's older. Twenty-two to be exact.   - he has the bad boy vibe going on.   - he can be sweet...sometimes.   - it was awesome to see him jealous over Cricket!   Yes, he did some things in the book that made me dislike him after that but still, he was fun to read about.   What I didn't like about Cricket was that he was after Lola like a love sick puppy and she just was messing with his head, leading him on. Yes, he was funny and swoony, but he was also too sweet and patient. Which bothered me because Lola unconsciously knew (I know that doesn't make sense, but you know, girl senses) she had Cricket to \\"fall back on\\" in case things with Max didn't work out. I wanted Cricket to get really mad at her, and he sort of did but it wasn't what I expected.   I got mad at Lola for having a boyfriend and giving Cricket hope. She wanted to be with her boyfriend but she also liked Cricket. It was a crazy, realistic love triangle. I understood her reasons or whatever but come on! Apart from that, their friendship/relationship was fun to read about.   Lola has a best friend, Lindsey, but we didn't get a lot from her and she was an interesting character. We got more of Anna and St. Clair, which I don't mind one bit. St. Clair had me laughing so much. It was cool to see them again because we get some info on how they're doing and what's going on with them after the end of Anna and the French Kiss.   To summarize, these were the problems that I had with Lola and The Boy Next Door:   - Cricket was too soft.   - Lola had a way to lead the poor guy on and then make him fall flat on his face. Poor guy.   But yes, the book was amazing and I couldn't put it down. I was laughing and sometimes I felt bad for Lola. Stephanie Perkins has a way to write everything more realistic-- super realistic; the expressions and the way the characters talked and behaved-- I don't know how she does it. You feel like you know the characters; that if you go outside, you'll find them because they're so real.   You should get this book! Everyone loves it. You can't go wrong with Stephanie Perkins.
4770031246|5.0|This book is inspired, and exactly what we needed to revitalize our everyday menu. The recipes are incredible of course, but what takes the proverbial cake is the list of materials in the back to just keep in stock. Using that, pretty much everything in the book can be cooked with a low-cost grocery trip that requires a little meal planning--but leaves room for a lot of variation if your tastes fluctuate as ours do.<br /><br />If you buy this book--who am I kidding? WHEN you buy this book, be sure to check out Maki's websites to keep getting great recipes and tips from her and the community there.
B001HN694K|5.0|A different twist on the old fairy tale Alice In Wonderland. In this version, Alice is a teenager, not a little girl. And Johnny Depp knocks it out of the ball park with his portrayal as the Mad Hatter.  The computer animation is awesome in this movie and the action is non stop and keeps you watching.
6304493681|4.0|Four to five stars for the movie itself, but ten stars for the musical main theme!  Although I used to love science fiction, at the age of seventy I find myself living in a world even beyond some of the science fiction of my youth, so I now rarely seek out science fiction, but I purchased this film because so many sources emphasized what an important film it was.   At the beginning of the film I was stunned by the exquisitely beautiful, soul wrenching women's vocal music.  As I got to know the extraordinarily powerful cyborg female who was aching to understand more about herself, I realized that the main theme music represented the main character's situation better than any other movie music that I could remember.  In the Special Features the various production staff members comment on the film shortly after its world premier.  The Musical Director, Kenji Kawai, praised the excellence of the sound and recording quality, but politely and modestly added that he was \\"not so sure about the music though\\" (even though he had written what might well be the best movie theme music ever)!  I just Googled his name and am happy to see that this theme is indeed recognized for the gem that it is, and that he is a prolific composer for films, tv, and video games.

B005NJ2K6U|2.0|I was very excited to see a new version of this game come out. I loved the first one, so I thought this one would be fun too. Its a unique puzzle game, but they took it in the wrong direction. Its way to cutsie and bloated. I have a fairly new and fast phone, but the game was unresponsive at times. It would take way too many taps to get the whole cell to spin. When I matched a gem set it would move just fine, but to make it spin...quick taps, long taps, many taps...it would just be hard to get it to spin. And another thing, the irregularly shaped cells that had no way of being spun were annoying. I usually don't like to put down a small game dev, but this is not fun. I put it down after two levels and I still play the first game months later.

B0055PMJMW|4.0|I enjoyed reading these stories, although they were not quite up to the author's usual quality. the first story is quite short, but they get progressively better. Die hard Bosch fans (like myself) will  put the quality issues behind them and try to enjoy the stories. others may not appreciate the stories. Regardless I'm still looking forward to  the Nov 2011 short stories and the next novel (the drop).

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|This is a fascinating film acted to perfection.  Somehow we have come to expect these things from Clint Eastwood, who has certainly had one of the more fascinating film careers ever.  Do we remember \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" and the other Italian westerns?<br /><br />I think Eastwood simply took a gamble with this film \\"Hereafter.\\"  He had an excellent screenplay which cried out to be made, so he just went and made a film.  Like almost everything he touches, the acting in the film was golden.<br /><br />He may even have had the idea that we need to think a bit more about \\"the hereafter\\" -- about life after death.  There are, after all, hundreds of people who have had Near-Death Experiences (NDEs), and yet no one seems at all comfortable discussing these things.

0312954468|1.0|I've enjoyed historical fiction before, and also am something of a fan of Egyptian mythology, so I was looking forward to this book.  I was sorely disappointed.  The narrator, Taita , is one of the most blatant Mary Sue characters I've seen in a real novel.  He's good at everything he tries (except for very brief and occasional setbacks when the plot requires otherwise); he knows everything; he's come up with countless inventions; he's written wonderful plays and verse and stories; he's beautiful, noble, intelligent, witty, persuasive, proper, incorruptible, and OH SO ANNOYING.  The supporting characters of Lostris and Tanus are marginally more sympathetic than Taita -- if only because he spends so much time talking about himself that less time is left for them -- but they carry the same traits: Lostris is the most beautiful woman ever (pages are devoted to Taita going on about her beauty), sweet and gentle in nature; Tanus is the epitome of manly perfection, the best warrior, bowman, sailor, actor (sic), countryman, etc.  Even the antagonist, Intef, is charming in his devious ways, physically beautiful, rich, powerful, devious, scheming -- but a perfect gentleman when you're not on his bad side.  It's a Thirty Sue Pileup!  Gag.  We get it, you say to me, the characters are shallow.  What about the story?  Okay, let's talk about the story:  Forbidden love between the Lostris and Tanus.  Tanus fights and defeats corruption to save Egypt.  The end.  I exaggerate somewhat, but only slightly.  There's certainly plenty of detail filled in (mind-numbing, tedious detail) but that's the story.  There's nothing creative, no deep human drama.  The author telegraphs every development well in advance -- I presume in a clumsy attempt at foreshadowing -- so there's not even suspense at what's going to happen next.  Alright, alright, Mr. Reviewer, you say.  So the characters and story are cliche.  But sometimes it's all in the telling.  Good writing can be a joy to read, even if the story is as old as time.  Surely Mr. Smith is at least an artist with his prose?  I wish.  Remember Taita, the Marty Sue Club President?  He's the narrator.  The whole thing is told in the first person.  You can't get away from him.  The writing is ponderous, pompous, pedantic, and pathetic.  Long tracts of irrelevant information, on everything from local flora and fauna to court gossip, none of which has anything to do with the plot, and all of which is recited with a kind of earnest worship which would be endearing in smaller doses, but instead tempts nausea.  I could care less about the purported historical (in)accuracy, but this is just plain bad writing.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|The disc indicates that it includes Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy, but unlike other Blu-Ray disks you can not download this movie to your iTunes library and therefore you can not watch it using your AppleTV.  The inclusion of the \\"Digital\\" copy is one of the main reasons I actually purchased the disk.  Unfortunately, WB has used this misrepresentration to actually sell you something with some new \\"streaming\\" service, and even though it says you can download the movie, that is only true using third party software and completely disconnected from all your other digital media.

0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller's Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, an African Childhood (Random House) is a remarkable memoir about her family's struggle for survival in southern and central Africa.<br /><br />Spanning the period 1975 through the early 2000's, Bobo, as the author was nicknamed, makes unique observations about a life most people can't even imagine.<br />Born in England, Bobo moved with her family to what was then Rhodesia, later Zimbabwe, when she was three. Over the years the family eked out a living on a series of farms.<br /><br />The author considers herself African and the story is told not from a visitor's viewpoint, but from an African perspective. For a period of time, her father joins the side of the white government in the Rhodesion civil war, while her mother fights the battles at home-drought, wandering stock, reluctant crops and errant help. Her mother's fierce love for her children isn't shown with coddling, but rather as a model for hard work, self-reliance and dedication to managing their home. Her father seems fearless, determined to fight for what he believes, yet he's quick with humor and wry wit. He throws himself wholeheartedly into whatever he's doing at the moment, a profound example for his children..<br /><br />Her family means everything to Bobo, yet at times it's a tentative relationship-always with love, but often with shaky foundations<br /><br />Fuller's ability to show this unique lifestyle is extraordinary. With sly humor, she holds nothing back, but is always without judgement. Africa is a tough continent for anyone-the heat can be relentless, the mosquitoes deadly, tribal wars frequent, harsh terrain often unforgiving. Mere survival is a challenge.<br /><br />At the beginning of each chapter, pictures of the family are shown, giving the reader a sense of being there (but without having to endure all the hardships). The first picture shown is Bobo as a very young girl loading a revolver.<br /><br />Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, an African Childhood is told with stark honesty<br />and sensitivity. It's hard not to be cynical, yet Fuller's story is unflinching and captivating. I whole-heartedly recommend this book.itivity.

1451648537|5.0|Job's story called for a book that was fair, not always flattering, and one that reflected Job's aesthetic style, which included among other things being clear, elegant, concise and (cost) effective. Did Mr. accomplish this goal?<br /><br />Although there is a good deal here that gives Steve's life a fair hearing, and all things considered, I believe the jury is still out on how well he accomplished that task -- especially if judged by the Job's aesthetic criteria and by Isaacson's previous works, in particular his biography of Einstein, which in my view was simply suberb.<br /><br />A brief overview of the book reveals that a great deal of the mysteries of Job's early life was cleared up: his being born out of wedlock and being put up for adoption, his reaction and life-long resentment to learning about it, and the eventual finding of his parents and sister (Mona Simpson). Another interesting part is Job's rough and tumble trajectory into adulthood: rebelling against his adopted parents, dropping out, indulging in drugs and living as a SF hippy, traveling to India and studying Zen, and then eventually finding his way into adulthood with a purpose. Where he then eventually meets up with his tech soul-mate and Apple co-founder, the much more brilliant and tech savvy, Stephen Wozniak.<br /><br />Job's strong point was never technical brilliance, but the ability to value and pursue simplicity, functionality and elegance. These turned out to be enough and were Job's signature; and will probably be his legacy.<br /><br />Was Steve a prince of a guy? Isaacson says no, that he was driven and thus created his own \\"reality distortion field.\\" He was often abrasive and insensitive and made his share of enemies. He had rough and tumble relationships with others in the computer tech business, such as his off-and-on-again relationship with Bill Gates.<br /><br />His opinions about President Obama are probably as characteristic of Job's brutal honesty and bluntness as any. He saidObama is not a leader because he is afraid to offend people. According to Job's philosophy one cannot product a first class product or run a first rate country with that kind of character. Job's strove for excellence in an uncompromising way. That ethic it seems has been replaced in the U.S. with making money by any means necessary.  But on this angle, I must say, it was no accident that after the 2006-7 economic crash, I was smart enough to pick up enough Apple stock (at $68 and $78) to offset all the accumulated losses in my IRA during the crash. More power to Mr. Jobs and to Apple! A great read. Five Stars

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Wow! I bought this CD strictly because I loved The Cave when I heard it on the radio, and I wanted to hear more.  Unlike other CDs I've bought in the past, where the one I heard on the radio was the ONLY song I liked, I can honestly say that The Cave is not even my favorite on this CD.  This is such a wonderful mix of folk, Irish, rock sounds.  I kid not when I say that I have this in my car's CD player, and I have listened to nothing else when driving back and forth to work since I bought it about 2 months ago. Over and over and over again! I love it!

B005C8VQT4|5.0|There is surely no argument that Karajan's best work is to be found in his many and multiple recordings of the works of Richard Strauss. He returned again and again almost obsessively over a lifetime of engaging with Strauss' music to refine his interpretations and re-record them in better sound as new technology emerged. I vividly remember acquiring the big, black, DG box set of LP's with the customary hagiography of the conductor in its cover photo and thinking of it rather as middle-aged men might regard the Jaguar XJ 4.2 litre in the garage: not perhaps for everyday use but so comforting to take for a spin when one tires of the workaday Ford and wants to indulge in unparalleled quality and luxury. While an attachment to some of the earlier analogue recordings from the 70's and even back to the 1959 &#34;Also sprach Zarathustra&#34;, is understandable, these digital versions happily re-mastered for the &#34;Karajan Gold&#34; and now in a bargain box must represent the best buy for anyone wanting the lot.<br /><br />There is certainly nothing routine or comfortable about these performances; they are stunning in their sweep and power. Some of them, especially the &#34;Alpine Symphony&#34;,  when they were first released in early digital, were seriously compromised by a harsh glare in the sound; the shrieking strings have now been tamed and the ambience is wholly acceptable.<br /><br />There isn't much point in my attempting a detailed analytical comparison of these landmark recordings; they are very much of a piece in style and execution, thrillingly executed by the foremost twentieth century exponent of Strauss' music directing the Rolls-Royce (to continue in vehicular vein) of orchestras with verve and passion.<br /><br />Karajan was consistent in matters of tempo and phrasing once he had hit upon what worked and the differences between these and earlier recordings are mostly in the quality of sound rather than interpretation. If anything, and in contradistinction to other aging conductors, his speeds are generally distinctly swifter than of yore. For example, in the &#34;Four Last Songs&#34; here he was no doubt aware that his soloist, Anna Tomowa-Sintow could not emulate Gundula Janowitz for breath so the first three songs are almost brisk. As it is, she spoils her otherwise affecting rendition of &#34;September&#34; by taking a breath before &#34;Augen&#34; at the close of the song. For the last song, &#34;Im Abendrot&#34;, Karajan risks a more leisurely pace at a timing of 7:06 and Tomowa-Sintow copes admirably. He doesn't drag them it in the manner of Eschenbach (8:45) for Fleming in the first of her two recordings, or Masur for Jessye Norman (an extraordinary 9:56), where despite the glory of their singing, there is a suggestion of ponderousness. Tomowa-Sintow makes the same clumsy gaff in the last notes of &#34;Die heiligen drei K&ouml;nige&#34;, taking a gasping breath in the middle of the last word &#34;sangen&#34;. Goodness knows why she ran out of wind or why they didn't re-take as she was surely capable of bridging the gap. These flaws, the slight tremulousness and lack of real deep-pile velvet in her tone mean that for me this is perhaps the only performance which cannot stand comparison with Karajan's previous version. Good though Tomowa-Sintow is, Janowitz reigns supreme.<br /><br />The only thing in this set new to me was that little carol about the Magi, with its gorgeous orchestral postlude so redolent of the sound-world of &#34;Capriccio&#34;. I love the way Strauss musically points the link between the Incarnation and the Crucifixion with a momentary disturbance at the words &#34;das &Ouml;chslein br&uuml;llte, das Kindlein schrie&#34; (&#34;the ox bellowed, the baby cried&#34;) before restoring serenity.<br /><br />The last disc forms a kind of postlude to what precedes, which is essentially music of epic scope and ambition: life and death, faith and philosophy, heroism and perseverance. Only Mahler andWagner work on a similarly large and varied canvas and for me Karajan's deployment of the forces before him confirms my conviction that the 100-piece symphony orchestra in full flight is one of the chief glories of civilisation. Some do not get on with Strauss' overt emotionalism and find his effects calculating or contrived; I have even read complaints that his music never achieves a suitably climactic resolution. Listening to how Karajan builds towards the overwhelming paean to Creation at the summit of the mountain in the &#34;Alpine Symphony&#34;, or the explosion of erotic passion that depicts the Hero's love for his Companion, I cannot begin to comprehend how a sentient being cannot respond to such magnanimity of soul. But as George Eliot so wisely observed, there are some like Mr Casaubon who, upon determining &#34;to abandon himself to the stream of feeling...perhaps was surprised to find what an exceedingly shallow rill it was.&#34;<br /><br />A short note and full texts in three languages are included.

B005LJK3AC|1.0|This is the perfect example of a low budget, over-hyped, lousy movie that unfortunately attracted a few bankable box office actors . Kevin Spacey should be ashamed to be associated with this crap. I actually felt sorry for their bosses after about 20 minutes of watching this. I really liked them more than the poor victim man-boyz. What is it with the wimpy guy movies? Is this really still entertaining? Why not just watch some re-runs with David Schwimmer on \\"Friends\\" or anything with Ben Stiller? Not that all low budget movies stink; loved \\"Bad Teacher.\\" This is just Bad Movie!

B003Y5H57O|3.0|John Carpenter's version of The Thing is a horror classic that has not only stood the test of time, but is considered by many to be one of the best horror movies ever. The desire to return to the 1982 film to attempt and capture a similar atmosphere in a modern motion picture is understandable, but the journey is likely to not only tarnish its reputation but weaken the impact it once had. Despite being held in such high regard, it's not like The Thing is a huge money maker. The 1982 film didn't even break $20 million at the domestic box office and didn't really become a success until it was released on VHS. Fast forward nearly thirty years and a new version of The Thing has covertly made its way into theaters or at least that's what it would like to lead you to believe.<br /><br />The Thing has a pretty decent opening. What's a modern day R-rated horror movie without a really terrible raunchy joke to break the ice (pun intended) minutes before everything hits the fan? The scenery is kind of breathtaking, as well. The roaming shot that opens the film where we see many of the snow caps in \\"Antarctica\\" along with most of the scenic shots are fairly beautiful. There's something about vast, snowy landscapes and icy structures that's mesmerizing.<br /><br />The special effects are probably the main reason to see The Thing. Many horror fans that have seen the prequel are upset that the film relied so much on CG, but I found them rather extraordinary. There's a mix of both practical effects and computer generation for a result that is both gnarly and out of this world. It's not so much that CG is so relevant in films nowadays that turns me off of it it's the amount of cheap-looking CG that constantly gets used. In regards to living up to Carpenter's film, The Thing came closest with how the creature looked. That along with how everything happening seemed to explain events in the 1982 version are a drawing factor. The Thing feels like a remake, but the events that unfold explain what happened leading up to the opening shot in Carpenter's film. The sound effects also at least make the film worth a viewing in the theater. The creature's sounds alone are pretty intense. The score wasn't necessarily memorable, but was just subtle enough and just enough to put you on the edge to add a little bit to the film. Lastly, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the most decent part of the cast. She's no R.J. MacReady, but she has the most developed personality.<br /><br />Unfortunately The Thing pretty much has everyTHING working against it despite showing quite a bit of potential. It has the blandest dialogue. Everything is so boring and monotone. All of the characters feel one-dimensional, as well; paper thin. Character development is mostly nonexistent. The jump scares feel cheap and it's so dead set on staying close to Carpenter's vision that it isn't able to establish an identity of its own. The \\"test\\" in the prequel is beyond weak and the film's constant absence of logic becomes groan-worthy.<br /><br />In the 1982 film, Childs (Keith David) says at one point \\"If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know it was really me?\\" This version of The Thing aspires to be a perfect imitation of Carpenter's version and it crashes and burns. It barely passes as an imperfect imitation. The way it relies on Carpenter's film as a crutch hurts it more than anything. However the special effects at least make it worth seeing in the theater. Although disappointing, The Thing is somewhat decent, better than what most review sites are giving it credit for, and moderately entertaining.eading up to the opening shot in Carpenter's film.

The story is told by an old dog and was very comforting as the dog shares his belief that death comes when we have done \\"what we are supposed to achieve in this life,\\" and that a dog who achieves his purpose comes back in the next life as a human being.  And interesting story which is well told.

B00006HBUA|3.0|Being a fan of the original cartoon I went to see this live-action version of &#34;Scooby-Doo&#34; in the theater in June, 2002 (Was it that long ago?). After the first 15 minutes or so I slowly became more and more disappointed. But after seeing it again last night, I must say it's better on repeat viewings.<br /><br />What most impressed me on my first viewing was Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Freddy Prinze Jr. as Fred was acceptable while Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne wasn't quite right for the role, although serviceable; I'm sure she got the role because of her popularity at the time. The addition of the winsome Isla Fisher as Mary Jane is a peripheral highlight. The CGI Scooby was good for the time (2002) and holds up pretty well.<br /><br />What disappointed me on my initial viewing? I was hoping for a straight live-action adaption of the cartoon sorta like 1994's &#34;The Flinstones.&#34; What I got instead was part homage and part parody. This would have worked for me but the film bogged down in the &#34;Spooky Island&#34; segment, which comprises the 2nd and 3rd acts, which amounts to a full hour of the film. What's wrong with this large chunk of the movie? The whole &#34;Spooky Island&#34; set was just too cartooney for a live-action homage. It's hard to explain, but it just turned me off. In hindsight, I suppose the cartooniness was intended since the film's based on a cartoon (aduh).<br /><br />Viewing it a second time, I had the same impressions of the film up to the 30-minute mark, but the final hour won me over. How so? I still don't like the limitations of the &#34;Spooky Island&#34; set but I was impressed with the whole 'well of souls' aspect and the complications thereof, as well as the ingenious way they included Scrappy-Doo in the plot. I used to think I was the only one who literally couldn't stand Scrappy-Doo, but now I see that my feelings were pretty much universal. What's wrong with Scrappy-Doo? Scrappy rightly become the symbol of an annoyingly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of the &#34;Brady Bunch,&#34; of course).<br /><br />The film runs 86 minutes, which is perfect for cartooney fare like this, and was shot in Queensland, Australia.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: This live-action version of &#34;Scooby-Doo&#34; is definitely better on repeat viewings. If you loathed it on your initial viewing be sure to give it another chance. Aside from obvious positives like Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini nailing Shaggy and Velma, the film features cutie Isla Fisher in a significant role, plus the creative plot elements of the 'well of souls' and Scrappy-Doo.<br /><br />GRADE: C+ or B- (5.5/10 Stars)ngly overexuberant or cute character added to a series in an attempt to maintain ratings, also known as the Cousin Oliver Syndrome (named after the character from the final season of the &#34;Brady Bunch,&#34; of course).

B004Y6CS8I|5.0|I first heard of him on KCRW. tHE SONG \\"HOLD ON,\\" got my attention. I bought the album. It is not bad at all. He sings on a few of them, but it's a lot of instrumentals for the most part; very cool sounding instruments.
0345522478|4.0|This one has been on my radar for a while now and there is good news and bad news.  The bad news is that it is short, only 292 pages long - but the good news is how enjoyable it is.  The cover has a quote from SFF World \\"American Gods meets Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden\\" and I think that is very accurate.<br /><br />Atticus is the last of the Druids, over 2,000 years old and hiding in the body of a 21 year old wanting nothing more than to quietly run his bookshop.  This is a world where the old Gods still exist and there is a healthy(?) dose of the likes of Werewolves, Vampires and Witches.  Atticus draws the attention of an old and powerful enemy who wants a sword owned by Atticus.  Cue politics of the Gods, alliances and more than a bit of bloodletting.  Despite a slightly complex start where it takes a chapter or so to get your head into the world you are reading about, this then takes off with the perfect blend of pace, wit, charm and entertainment.  Especially enjoyable is his companion, an Irish Wolfhound who has an amusing take on life while being rather fond of French Poodles and sausages!<br /><br />So, short but very entertaining indeed.

From GAEMS Support:<br />\\"Yes,... it sometimes detects 1080p and the screen does support it.. but you won't notice I visual difference between 1080p and 720p because of the (screen) size.<br /><br />Everything is solid about the G155 carry case and LED screen.  Definitely worth buying.  My only complaints were the slightly limited viewing angle, the angle at which the open-lid (screen) is visible--not direct line of sight as you need to be looking down on it a little bit.  I would have also liked a small remote.  A thin profile carry case would be nice too.<br /><br />Definitely consider the G155 if you're on the road or you want to game anywhere.
1416596097|4.0|I've read most of John Le Carre's novels over the past twenty-five years or so, and have long counted him among my favorite authors. His command of the English language is unparalleled among living writers, in my estimation, and he's second to none in the espionage genre.<br /><br />My assessment has not been altered by \\"A Most Wanted Man.\\" The book bears all Le Carre's usual trademarks: unique characters, conveyed with subtle shades of gray; an intricate and creative plot, and an appreciation for the moral ambiguities of international politics. I found particular resonance, if not appeal, in the character of Tommy Brue. I also appreciated Le Carre's willingness to take on the subject of international terrorism, and the complicated interplay of Islamic funamentalists and Western intelligence agencies. An absorbing read, and one I enjoyed and would recommend, but....<br /><br />I will admit I found the whole to be somewhat less than satisfying---that it fell a little under the lofty standards of many of Le Carre's earlier works. There were frequent flashes of his old brilliance, to be sure, especially a deftly constructed scene where Brue is recruited by the British Secret Service. But the story seemed to meander at times, and ultimately finish on notes that left me wishing for a little more.<br /><br />That said, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\", for all its minor shortcomings, is superior to most of the fiction on today's best-seller lists. If you like espionage novels, and wish to relish the pre-eminent master of the genre, this book is still very much worth your time.

B0056BU3I2|5.0|This 5th installment brought all favorite characters from the first 4 together, so it's definitely a treat for all of us that liked the first four. The flavor is in the spirit of the original movie - deeper with more emotions for the characters.  Make sure you see the movie to the end even after the credit. There is a teaser, hinting this 5th movie is not the final!  \\"Do you believe in ghost?\\"  I'm reviewing just the blu-ray disc. The 1080p video quality is top notch. Detailed, sharp, but look real and natural.  The 5.1 audio is precisely decoded to play on designated speakers in such a way that I felt so involved: rockets whiz pass me, bullets riddled all through me in a cross fire, and car crashes / wrecks are just right level of sound force. I have a Butt Kicker installed under my home theater sofa. When the body slammed into the ground, I get the jolt. When the vault gets dragged on the road, I felt my sofa was getting dragged and me along with it! This is definitely a show piece!  There are some nice extras on the blu-ray. The digital copy is also as good as it can be, but I only watched couple of minutes of it.

I can listen to this one on eternal repeat just like the old albums, but I am more excited for each coming song. They have completed the Fire, Water, Earth, and Skye cycle... The Hunter is about rebirth and new opportunities.<br /><br />Pursue Happiness With Diligence. Buy this album immediately.
1594202842|4.0|I must say that \\"Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother\\" was a well-written and brutally honest book. I realize that there's been a lot of discussion about Amy Chua's parenting style (which some say borders on abuse), but I think people should understand that Chua was raised by immigrant parents who raised her the \\"Chinese way\\". Chua makes clear that the \\"Chinese way\\" (strict parenting) can cross racial/ethnic lines. Chua raised her girls, Sophia and Lulu to expect to be the best at whatever they did (school, piano, violin) and felt that it was her responsibility as a parent to \\"push\\" them to do so. Sometimes the book is shocking (spoiler alert: when Chua doesn't accept the girls' homemade birthday card because they are not \\"good enough\\" and when she threatens to give away the girls' toys to the Salvation Army). However, it's evident Chua also loves her girls. By the end of the book, Chua \\"softens\\" somewhat. Chua discusses how unreasonable she was at times (for example, she was exposed during a Yale Law Student reception at her home when some of the law students found notes that she would leave her daughters). She also agonized over if her way of parenting was the \\"best way\\", given the pervasive influence of Western Culture. Her daughters turned out fine; Sophia now attends Harvard University and had defended her mom's way of parenting; and Lulu (being especially strong-willed) quit violin and started participating in (previously unacceptable) activities such as tennis. I guess the reason why I'm sympathetic to Amy Chua is because I also had parents that had high expectations-and compromise was rarely an option :). I benefited by their strict parenting style. Also, I was in an academic program (and became friends with) many Chinese students. I came to respect how hard they studied and the sacrifices they made to \\"do better\\"-at the same time being disadvantaged (English as a second language, traveling to the US by themselves to study, etc.). They seemed to have a strong \\"inner core\\" and kept working despite issues that \\"came up\\". Of course there were problems too (like everyone else), but I admired my friends' commitment to family, their community, and education.   There are positive components of parenting that one can take from this book-such as spending time to help kids with math, spelling, etc. instead of saying \\"I'm tired\\" and putting a kid in front of a television set. I'm not being glib here.... research studies have shown that American kids spend far too much time watching TV. Conversely, tutoring can also be done with compassion and patience.... not calling a kid \\"garbage\\" when they're having a hard time with a subject (like Chua did). There has to be some sort of balance. There's so much I've left out of this review, but suffice it to say that I respect Chua's (sometimes painful) honesty about her family... and herself.

034552554X|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a book that will both break your heart and fill you with hope. Victoria's circumstances often feel devoid of hope, and yet she over comes her struggles one at a time. We watch her make terrible mistakes, yet learn and grow from them. We see her grow from an angry girl into a woman trying to help others understand their emotions and communicate their hopes and dreams for the future through the Victorian language of flower.<br /><br />If you chose just one book to read the remainder of this year, may I suggest that you chose The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh? I have not been so moved by a book since I read the much acclaimed The Help.<br /><br />Content: Some swearing, mild sexual content.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I had been waiting a long time for this release in high definition, and yes, the audio & video on these movies was excellent, and should not disappoint even the pickiest A/V enthusiast.  The big let down for me was the packaging.  I expected to see these 3 classic movies housed in something at least equal to that of \\"The Alien Anthology\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  So, if you are not an avid collector, this release will be fine.  For me, something nicer to present these discs in would have raised my rating to 5 stars!  Update 10/27/2011  -  I do agree with many of the other reviewers comments since my original post, & admit I was being \\"kind\\" with my own review.  The Bluray.com review gave the picture quality for the entire trilogy a 4 out of 5, so I was anticipating something much better, but didn't want to make a harsh early judgement.  It is true, the video portion could/should have been better, especially in the case of \\"The Lost World\\", which to me, appeared to have lower picture quality than JP or JP3.  I do believe that the expectations for this release were huge (myself included), & it was definitely a disappointment to see this whole thing treated in a suboptimal manner.  I still feel that the picture/sound quality is acceptable, but below the standards of most other classic releases, & certainly the millions of fans who expected much more.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|After the 5 year wait, the hype, their past solid performances and current success of every teardrop is a waterfall, I am truly sorry I bought/downloaded this CD.  I SHOULD have listened to the samples first, but didn't think I needed to.  Knowing now what I did'nt know then, I would not have done it, even for free.  I have listened to the CD all the way through twice.  Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />In case you didn't notice, there is NOT 14 songs on MX, just 11.  I'm not even sure why the blends are even in there, they SHOULD have been in the song itself.  A Hopefull transmission does blend well, but the song is horribly muddied.  AND not to mention, I listen to a variety of songs on my MP3  and it's irritating to hear an intro without the song following.<br /><br />Through out the CD, IMHO, they are trying out new directions and new stuff on every level. all at once.  STOP!<br /><br />There are two songs that may grow on me.<br />Princess of China, except for the very annoying weird sound that is done three times and at the very end.<br />Major Minus, except the Ooo Ooo is very annoying.  I kept wondering where I had heard that sound before.  It sounds like our local Heron Cranes.<br /><br />I will never buy another Coldplay CD till they find themselves again AND prove it to me.<br /><br />Sorry guys  FAIL!
0307593312|4.0|I am rushing this review to warn other Murakami fans (fanatics?) that this one starts out surprisingly slow.  It wasn't until Part 2 that the pace started approaching a typical Murakami.  I am also warning those who have never read Murakami before that that is NOT the novel to start with.    As always with his novels, it is of little value to attempt a plot summary.  Cults and Little People and two moons?  Yep, sounds like Murakami.  In fact you can open the book to any section and after a few minutes know that you can be reading no author other than Murakami.  It is a highly unusual voice, and comes through as distinctively in this as in his other books.    There are two main characters, a man and a woman who knew each other as children.  Both had typically Murakami odd lonely childhoods, and though they haven't seen each other since they were young, both continue to remember the other with a particular intensity.  In alternating chapters we follow the lives of these two, and soon we figure out that their stories are slowly (oh so slowly) leading towards each other.  As always, I am immensely enjoying reading this book.  But I do have reservations.  The book is too long, maybe 1/3rd too long.  A typical feature in his books is to present an idea, an object, a reference from one perspective, and then repeat it, often multiple times, from other perspectives.  Only through these repeated narrow views does the reader begin to piece together the true import of what is being presented.  This layering of perspectives, added to the unusual nature of what is being seen, is core to the world Murakami unveils to us in his fiction.  The problem in this book is that the perspectives are over-layered and at some point lose their power.  I was thoroughly sick of the Little People, two moons, 1Q84... the entire \\"other\\" world way before it even really appears.  There are insufficient ideas for the size of the book, and this increasingly claustrophobic duality of the 2 worlds and 2characters coming increasingly close simply gets old after a few hundred pages.  I've read every single book by Murakami, including the non-fiction cult and running books, but this is the only one that has not 100% engaged me.  His characters are usually somewhat flat, and it works well for the hyper-active worlds these characters inhabit.  But that same flatness continued for almost 1,000 pages is tough.  Without the characters as a strong focus for the readers, you are forced to concentrate on the events as the main focus of the book, and following flat characters through a dizzying world of ever accelerating events left this reader exhausted.  I expect to have my reactions mediated through the characters actually living those events.  But because these two characters are emotionally stunted I found myself almost ignoring their responses as my mind leapt straight into the events themselves.    I realize this is a less than coherent review, but I am trying to explain how this book by one of my favorite authors has so far left me alternately bored and exhausted, yet I can still recommend it to fans of Murakami, since we've been without a novel from him for too long.
0062011847|5.0|When I finished \\"Snuff\\" two days ago, I said to myself, \\"Very good, but not quite as good as 'Thud!'(my personal standard for Best Discworld Novel).  But after two days of browsing back through \\"Snuff\\" and savoring the best bits, I might have to revise that to \\"and as good as 'Thud!'\\".<br /><br />Of all the Discworld novels, my favorite subseries is the City Watch books, and my favorite character is Sam Vimes, so obviously \\"Snuff\\" had a good head start towards landing on my favorites list.  I consider the overriding theme of Pratchett's Discorld books (at least, the theme of those novels since the early ones that were basically spoofs of sword-and-sorcery books) is the responsibility of people (human, dwarf, troll, etc.) to Do Good (which is more or less Act Right towards Others, or the traditional Golden Rule, noncynical version).  To confront Evil and Do Good.  And this is especially front and center in the City Watch novels that ask the serious question of how much evil can a good man do in pursuit of the fight against Evil?  \\"Good\\" of course is a sometimes slippery quality.  Sam Vimes usually tries to equate it essentially with the law, but sometimes, as in \\"Snuff\\", \\"legal\\" and \\"right\\" do not necessarily coincide.  Oh, these novels are certainly humorous, but they have a deeply thoughtful heart.<br /><br />Nobody does this better than Terry Pratchett: make people think serious thoughts while chuckling with joy and being entertained by witty wordplay.
0857685570|5.0|Scarcely is an artistfs work as instantly recognizable as that of Drew Struzan.  His painting style is the modern equivalent to Michaelangelo on the pop culture landscape.  HIs biggest break outs were the stylish posters for Star Wars, and then later, Indiana Jones for George Lucas, who provides the forward here, commenting on the work of his favorite artist.  Ifm inclined to agree with his comments, that in 1,000 years, people will look at Drewfs work and whether they know much of the explanation or not, will be captivated and mystified by his paintings.     Released earlier this month from Titan Books, Oeuvre is a compendium of the best of Drewfs works, from his theatrical posters, to extra paintings hefs done of some of his most famous concepts, famous album artwork, down to his personal artwork that he paints for himself, even plates he painted of famous celebrities.  Having made his name as the premiere post artist of the past century, Struzan is to the point in his career where he doesnft need to take any job, he does simply when itfs right.     Far different from the 1980s, where Drew did the posters for such movies as E.T., Blade Runner, the bulk of the  Police Academy series, Johnny Dangerously, The Goonies, Big Trouble in Little China, Adventures in Babysitting, The Back to the Future Trilogy, Hook, Harlem Nights, The Muppets, Masters of the Universe, and into the 90s with posters for The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, in addition to posters for childrenfs fare like both of The Flintstones live action movies, as well as Duck Tales: The Movie and all the Star Wars prequels.  In recent years, he has done posters for Hellboy, The Mist, and Zathura.     The full list is on display here, in fact, the text pages take up very little space in the nice, wide, glossy hardbound cover.  Most of the texts concerns Drew explaining his art, how he got into the field, how he met George Lucas, and what he tries to do with every assignment he was given.  Having done such a wide array of films, from major Hollywood blockbusters to minor independent B-films, Struzanfs work covers the vast array beautifully.     Not every piece of work is in this book, but a very good amount appear right here in these wonderfully reproduced pages.  Each one could be framed on its own, speaking to the work of Struzan as an artist.  Wonderfully unique, but with that ever-recognizable style that sticks out in a way that is unreproducible by anyone else.     For fans of the aforementioned movies, (and really, who doesnft have at least one favorite movie on that list?), this book is a wonderful treat.  Itfs a joy to flip through the pages and see bright, slick posters for a large majority of Americafs favorite movies from the past 25 years.  For everyone that could care less about The Muppets, there is the amazing poster of The Thing.  Itfs all here, you just have to check it out.     9.3/10
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It is always refreshing to get the straight skinny on something as enigmatic as the Life of Steve Jobs. It was an absolutely fascinating read and lays bare an unadulterated glimpse into the universe of this legend.  The author has a unique and far-reaching method of communicating his story and I assure you , it will captivate your attention. Fills in alot of gaps about Mr.Jobs and the incredible life he led.  I give it my highest stamp of approval and I am a very critical and discerning judge of written publications , biography or otherwise.  Buy the book.
0783116934|5.0|Years ago I had occasion to be present during some important moments during the Beltway Sniper case. I realized, seeing what I saw and hearing what I heard, that the investigation into the murders was being deliberately compromised for political reasons. This later came out, in a muted fashion, in the press, but to this day the public has very little awareness that the case could have been wrapped up much sooner, and many lives saved, if the cops had simply been allowed to do their job. Sadly, it seems this problem goes the world over, even to the old Soviet Union, where if nothing else, you'd at least have expected the police to work efficiently!<br /><br />CITIZEN X is the story of Andrei Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn), a Russian factory worker who on the surface appears to be a failure at absolutely everything in life. Actually Andrei is quite good at one thing - murder. He prowls the railways, looking for victims to sexually assault and then murder, or murder and then sexually assault - Andrei is so sexually frustrated he doesn't much care. As the bodies pile up around rural train stations in the backwaters of the Soviet Union, a brilliant but socially awkward forensics investigator, Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea) is put on the case. Burakov rapidly concludes that the corpses are the result of a serial killer, but Soviet ideology, in the person of local Party boss Bondarkchuk (Joss Ackland) insists that serial killings are the result of Western, capitalist decadence and can't possibly occur in the Worker's Paradise. Burakov finds an extremely unlikely friend and ally in his police superior, Colonel Fetisov (Donald Sutherland), a buck-passing, butt-covering apprachnik who slowly begins to admire, and then to imitate, his relentless subordinate. Joining the team belatedly, but with great effect, is a brilliant psychiatrist, Dr. Bukhanovsky (Max von Sydow), whose psychological profile of the killer proves to be an invaluable tool in casting the net to catch him.<br /><br />CITIZEN X continues the long tradition of superior, character-driven movies produced by HBO Films. The settings look and feel authentic Soviet, and the process of watching forensic science evolve in front of your eyes is fascinating. The acting too is first rate; veteran Jeff DeMunn manages to take a character who on the surface is the soul of evil and make him seem more pitiable than frightening. Likeiwse, Stephen Rea does a good job of portraying a man under unbearable psychological stress, while Donald Sutherland, who can be annoyingly inconsistent as an actor, is at his best as a bureacrat who discovers that he has a soul. Radu Amzuelescu also has an interesting turn as Rea's cop-assistant Federenko, who develops a grudging respect for a boss he initially regards as a feckless scientist.<br /><br />One of the funny things about law enforcement is its universiality. Cops are basically cops the world over, and deal with the same pressures and stresses regardless of the country in which they serve. In my own career I saw firsthand how political correctness can cost lives, but also how dogged police work, often carried out in the face of official interference, and can save them. CITIZEN X reminds us that for every clock-punching, donut-eating Clancy Wiggum out there, there is also a Burkov - a man obsessed with putting the bad guys out of business no matter what the cost to himself.ues the long tradition of superior, character-driven movies produced by HBO Films.

044656740X|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad is both valuable and dangerous.  It was valuable to me because the book itself provides some very useful concepts (including the philosophy that I try to live my life by every day - I do not work for money; I work to learn) around matters of personal finance.  The idea that we are all working for ourselves is probably the central and most important point.  However, some of the investment advice (including the some of the highly leveraged real estate techniques) are very dangerous and were the same techniques that wiped out many people during this last real estate bubble.  I highly recommend this book as a good overall framework on how you should guide your career and financial life; but don't get bogged down by some of the specific investment strategies.  You could be very sorry.
B000001GXF|4.0|Schubert: Piano Quintet in A \\"Trout\\" and String Quartet in d \\"Death and the Maiden\\" Amadeus Quartet with Emil Gilels and Rainer Zepperitz (Deutsche Grammophon)<br /><br />This CD has Schubert's two best-known chamber works, the sunny \\"Trout\\" Quintet, written in 1819 when Schubert was 22, and the dark \\"Death and the Maiden\\" Quartet of 1824, written when Schubert suffered from illness.  Both works get their sobriquets from movements that are variations on a Schubert song of that name.<br /><br />The Quintet, written quickly for a special occasion, has several unusual features.  It has five movements, the extra one being the set of variations, and is scored for piano and an unusual string combo: violin, viola, cello, and bass.  The harmonic schemes in the first two movements are very unusual for a classical period work.  Only the variation movement has a coda, and it is very short.  And transitions between sections of a movement are abrupt.  As usual with Schubert, there are beautiful lyrical second subjects.<br /><br />The Quartet is one of Schubert's chamber music masterpieces.  The haunting \\"Death and the Maiden\\" theme used for the variations is unforgettable.  The first movement is taut drama, and the last is a furious tarantella.  But there are lyrical moments as well.<br /><br />The Quintet was recorded in 1975, with Emil Gilels at the piano and Rainer Zepperitz on the bass.  This made for a superb combination of musicians, and I think the result is a great performance.  The only concern I have is that the piano dominates the violin part in the duet that begins the opening movement.  That may be a result of microphone placement.  Otherwise, I haven't heard another version that I would prefer.  The remastered sound is very good.  Definitely five stars in my opinion.<br /><br />The Quartet was recorded in 1958, in the earliest days of stereo, but the sound has also been remastered and is quite good, though not as good as for the Quintet.  Here, the string players are very proficient, take lively tempi, and favor a straightforward, matter-of-fact performance.  Calling it perfunctory is much too harsh, but it leans in that direction.  I personally prefer the more subtle performance of Quartetto Italiano or the more dramatic Henschel Quartet version (with excellent sound).  The Melos Quartet version is also worth considering for a performance that emphasizes the lyrical aspects.  But the Amadeus version is worthy in its way, and being paired with the excellent Quintet performance is a plus.  I'd give Amadeus four stars on this one.straightforward, matter-of-fact performance.

1594484805|4.0|I wish many of my past bosses would have read \\"Drive.\\"  If you are in charge of motivating others - go get this book.  The premise of \\"Drive\\" is that \\"sticks and carrots\\" are no longer valid motivational tools.  Human beings are far more complex (and irrational) than what traditional motivational theory taught us in business school.  In fact, based on the studies referenced in the book, the whole idea of rewards and punishment can actually destroy productivity and innovation. Intrinsic motivation is far more important.  Autonomy, mastery and purpose are the magic recipe for motivational success.  The chapter on \\"flow\\" is worth the price of the book (though difficult and possibly unrealistic to implement). I had no trouble buying off on the theories in this book as this is how I'm motivated.  Pink does a great job of documenting his hypothesis and the book provides a toolkit on how to be a better motivator.  \\"Drive\\" should be required reading for anyone in a leadership position.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|\\"The Walking Dead\\" is an adaptation of a graphic novel series with the same name.  It is one of the best miniseries to come on TV in a while.  There are many detailed reviews on this product, so I will keep my review brief.<br /><br />The story focuses on approximately 15 main characters who are trying to survive after the dead have started coming back to life.  In some ways, it is an affirmative action sampling of the population since all groups are represented. (Which seems a little fake, but in a place like Atlanta it could happen.) The walking dead are zombies in the traditional sense...they want to eat living things and they are killed by destroying the brain.  They're typically referred to as \\"walkers\\" in this series.<br /><br />The first episode focuses primarily on the hero, Rick Grimes, who is a police officer that wakes up in the hospital after being in a coma.  Gradually, he learns the reality of the apocalyptic world.  A few of the other survivors are introduced to us in Episode 1 as well.<br /><br />The remainder of the episodes deal with a wider group of people and a few \\"quests\\" to either find someone or rescue someone.  The final episode of Season 1 seemed a little out of place with the previous tone of the movie, but it ended the season with a hard hitting reality check: there is no safety in Atlanta.  Many of the characters do come across as stereotypes, but there will be more seasons for character development.<br /><br />People will enjoy this series if they realize that it focuses on the characters more than blasting zombies.  It's a human interaction story.  Just don't take it too seriously or think too hard about it.  Just enjoy it and remember it was based on comic books.
1591844096|5.0|Linchpin is one of those books that cause you to completely question your methods, beliefs, and philosophies when it comes to how you work and how you can be most effective and successful.  The book really hits the mark when describing people that are cogs in the machine instead of real innovators and visionaries.  Godin breaks down work in such a way that you will really begin to question whether or not you are creating real value or simply filling a chair everyday.  The chapter on The Resistance is well worth the price you pay for the entire book.  It does a masterful job of describing how the fear generated by your reptilian brain is sabotaging you every step of the way.  More importantly, Godin also describes how to control this part of the brain.  Many of the Fortune 500-class companies that I have worked for would greatly dislike the philosophies detailed in this work (because it rallies against their six-sigma everyone-is-a-piece-of-meat world).  Recommended!
0545403359|4.0|By just examining  the cover of this book, all sorts of children will be attracted to reading this novel - boys interested in war along with girls interested in horses. That being said, you're getting a book which delivers much more than a story on war and horses. Morpurgo discusses themes mostly only found in adult novels. Intimate friendships, devotion, dedication, love, angst, and sacrifice. This story is indeed about a horse and his owner, but goes much deeper than that. I highly recommend this novel to any child and adult (young or old) looking for a quick, yet memorable read. Let's hope the movie doesn't ruin this story!

This book provides a well written summary of a research study (that was admittedly executed 15 years ago) that sought out the defining characteristics of visionary companies.  In a nutshell, a visionary company:  1.  Focuses on clock building (building an organization and processes that live on beyond the current leader.  2. Focuses on the genius of the AND (everything does not have to be an EITHER OR situation; sometimes you can have it all).  3.  Preserve their core ideologies and stimulates progress.  4.  Creates alignment with core ideologies and purpose.  This is a must read for anyone with an entrepreneurial spirit; even if they work in a huge bureaucratic mess.

006016848X|5.0|Since I'm a man, I'll come at this review from that perspective.  First, this book is not going to tell you what a woman is thinking.  Unfortunately, there is no power on heaven or earth that can help you with that mystery.  However, it does help provide some very deep understanding on why she is thinking it (once you finally figure out what she's thinking).  The chapters about men going to their caves and women riding through a series of emotional waves is pure gold.  I highly recommend that if you are in a relationship (no matter how long you've been in it) that you BOTH read it.  She needs to understand why we men do the things we do as well.  In general, this is a great book for anyone that is married, dating or wants to do so.  I wish I would have known most of this stuff decades ago...it would have saved me a lot of time and effort.
B005F6NA56|2.0|I've been a Feist fan since I first heard \\"Mushaboom.\\" This album takes the wonderful Let it Die and it's fun follow-up and throws them to the wolves. These songs are bare, boring, and devoid of any life. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it is when dealing with Feist, the normally slightly pop-oriented singer. If you're expecting melody or charm, look elsewhere.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I review this film now with a mixture of sorrow, elation, and wishful thinking of what could have been. I can remember the press conference he gave on CNN. At the time it seemed like no big deal. \\"OK,\\" I thought, \\"Michael's making another comeback after another long hiatus away from the spotlight.\\" Little did I realize that that would be the last time I'd see him alive and thinking back it's so ironic that his last concert was dubbed \\"This is It!\\"<br /><br />Took me a good year to getting around to seeing it. In that time I couldn't even bring myself to hear any of his songs. Had all of his adult stuff (was too poor growing up to get any of his earlier stuff) but I don't consider myself a hardcore fan. Still, all of his songs are like a soundtrack for all my memories growing up and my nostalgia comes mainly from that, from losing an icon from my generation.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the review. It's incredible. To think that this guy was 50 years old, had been doing this for over 40 years, had been through all the scandals he'd been through, you wouldn't be able to tell it watching and listening to him in this well-edited film by Kenny Ortega, truly a bittersweet farewell to the gloved one. That light, soft, often fragile voice of his still sounds as sweet, as beautifully alien and innocent it ever has on all of his songs and those which he performed with his brothers, especially their hit \\"I'll be there,\\" where he gets carried away at the end and warns his organist (Michael Bearden) not to let him get too carried away and jeopardize his voice. This film shows how dedicated and how obsessed Michael was, often softening his reprimands by saying in his light voice \\"I love you.\\"  There are many great numbers throughout this film but the standout is saved for last, Billy Jean. He left himself, so to speak, and danced his ass off as the performers stood and watched with their mouths open, cheering him on and clapping. It was great.<br /><br />Finally, there's a poignant retrospective of Michael by all the people he worked with in the film including various dancers, the musical director, former managers, etc. Say what you want about the man's personal life but there is no argument as to the fact that he is the greatest entertainer who ever lived. No one else even comes close. Thanks, Mike.all the people he worked with in the film including various dancers, the musical director, former managers, etc. Say what you want about the man's personal life but there is no argument as to the fact that he is the greatest entertainer who ever lived.

I wasn't before I read this, and now I like King, and this book, very much.  See for yourself!
B004RE29PO|5.0|Cameron's an overachiever if there ever was one. This was the first film he did that told me that he was something special. Not that Terminator's not good. No, Terminator's incredible, but  the Hollywood landscape is full of one-hit wonders like Shaylaman, The Wachowski's, etc. Rarely does one come along who, even at his worst, is still heads and shoulders above his peers. Others that come to mind like this are Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali, Michael Jordan, the late Steve Jobs...In the world of spectacle, of rock-'em sock-'em action films, no one's like James Cameron. The most hands-on of any director.<br /><br />This time, it's War! This is the slogan for Aliens, Cameron's follow up to Ridley Scott's brilliant Alien. To sum up Cameron's version, an astronaut named Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is discovered on a derelict space ship after being asleep for 40 years in frozen hibernation. She is revived and asked to be a part of a reconnaissance expedition consisting of Marines to a planet overrun with alien creatures. And I'll stop right here for anyone who has yet to see the film. What I will say is this: imagine a bunch of jingoistic Marines packing the latest in high-tech weaponry turned loose and given carte blanche to kill. Throw into this mix a couple of mean b*tches trying to protect their babies, flamethrowers, nuclear bombs, and industrial-grade exoskeleton suits and you can imagine the rest. Absolute bad-ass! Can you imagine how this film would have been if it were done with today's technologies in cgi?<br /><br />But the fact that these technologies weren't available is what makes the film so good, damn good. Computers can't replicate the organic feeling and weight of real textures. The aliens in this film look better than the cgi aliens in the later films because of the organic-hand-made craftmanship that went into creating them, something I have yet to see duplicated in a 3d environment. Live action and cg together is never seamless to the eye, which can't be fooled. Cgi looks good because it's hyper-real and placed beside live elements, cgi comes off as cartoonish and weightless.<br /><br />Aliens is Cameron unleashed,to date, his 2nd best (and most original) action film behind the original Terminator. I prefer the special edition to the theatrical version. Normally when you see what was left out of the original it's justified; in this case, it wasn't. The added scenes add even greater depth to Ripley's character and her maternal relationship with the orphan girl, Newt. This version also plays up the gung-ho mentality of the marines a lot more than the theatrical version. Looking at this film now, one gets the sense that Cameron was looser, having more fun doing it than he did directing Avatar, which had such a ridiculous budget attached with it. Like Jackson was just before he made Thriller, looser and not under a lot of pressure, having fun. Now, every film Cameron does will have to be bigger than his last film.<br /><br />Anyways, Aliens is one of those films that will never look cheesy no matter how old it gets. Still one of my favorite action films.good because it's hyper-real and placed beside live elements, cgi comes off as cartoonish and weightless.

B003L77FYS|4.0|I went through the entire first season over a single weekend simply because I couldn't stop.  This was a fresh new series with many parts to love. I was left wanting for more as the first season   had only 10 episodes - I suppose the network threw it out sort of on a trial.   The second season, however, was disappointing. May be my expectations were set too high.  It had expanded to 24 episodes and the writers clearly were out of ideas. It became predictable and I lost interest.  The first season was so good that I decided to give the third season a try before walking away and to my pleasant surprise, it has  recaptured much of the charm of the first season without changing any of the characters.  If you like the original NCIS, you will like CASTLE.
B005KGPC4S|4.0|First off, I admit to being thrown off my game by this type of film coming from the pen and imagination of Kevin Smith, but this social commentary/thriller doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />My complaints are few and far between, but enough to justify deleting a star.  Michael Parks- in the performance of a career- chews up the scenery with a malevolent and totally believable preacher gone mad.  Other than Smith's tendency to let Parks' character occasionally engage in mumble-speak, it's spot on and frighteningly controlled.  If this wasn't a Smith film the performance would garner Oscar consideration.<br /><br />Unlike many other Smith films the dialog was under control and focused- only straying during opening sequences where the boys engage in an excessively foul mouthed dialog which supposedly sets up their encounter with the faux prostitute.  Even the ATF sequence and subsequent inquisition of the Goodman character were believable and restrained.<br /><br />Two cinematography complaints- the use of head attached cameras during \\"flight sequences\\" and the sharp cutting during same.  It's as if Smith felt the need to stylistically insert his imprint on the film, but both techniques were distracting and failed to advance the terror factor inherent in the film.<br /><br />Over all, RED STATE was well acted and directed, and had a good, cogent story.  Contrary to those who feel this was Kevin Smith going Michael Moore in his pursuit of a particular social agenda, I didn't feel a heavy hand at work here.  The characters and the story are so chillingly believable that they overcame whatever biases Smith may have brought to the table.

If their faces were anything to go by in this show, it was time.<br /><br />Despite delivering the hits, I could almost sense the fire and passion smouldering even as the boys played the right songs and hit the right notes.  Part of it felt a little funereal.  They seem melancholy in this show somehow, only cracking a smile now and then.<br /><br />A-ha has never been less than professional. Yet, despite their tight musicianship, a strange repression of passion in this final act seemed to permeate as one song played after another.  No longer young exuberant pop-meisters, the trio looked decidedly more worn but still cut a striking sight.<br /><br />So this was a modest and polite farewell - not about striking a high note. For a band that's delivered many emotive pieces, they kept their feelings in check.  Goodbye A-ha.
B000EXZI1Y|5.0|This has to be one of the Best of the BeeGee works. I listen to this CD on my computer, I have down load on my MP3 player and I listen to it in my car.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Give us the original movies in blue ray!  If Lucas wants to give us his \\"improved\\" versions too, I can tolerate that but I want the original movie and I'm tired of Lucas not caring want the fans want.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|I just love these guys and their music.......they have excellent singing voices.  I would highly recommend this CD, or for that matter, any of their CD's.
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House was outstanding! The writing was superb and this was a book I couldn't put down. The story is about a young Irish girl named Lavinia who becomes orphaned on a ship heading to the United States. She is taken home by the captain to live with his slaves in the kitchen house as an indentured servant. Under the care of the slaves, she quickly becomes family. The relationships between the slaves and Lavinia is heartwarming as all she wishes is to belong and to have their love. However, the horrors of slavery and the hopelessness of the situation make this book very difficult to read. The atrocities the slaves suffered under the evil hands of their owners was at the same time disgusting and terrifying, particularly upon realizing just how helpless they were. I highly recommend this book! It's a MUST READ!
B003L77G6A|5.0|It's an awesome season. Worth the watch. Over and over again. You'll have to watch it at least twice. You'll miss half the good stuff from laughing the first time in that spot.
B005PW3OS8|4.0|This was a very good movie, would recommend it highly. The acting was good, I had thought it may be cheesy but was wrong. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B00001QEE8|4.0|daughter loves the movie.  was a used copy but in very good condition.  no problems so far.  she really enjoys the singing and dancing in the film.  the colors are not as bright as the newer limited edition, but the picture fits in the screen better.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|They did it.  And it is awesome.  They not only got it right, and cast the perfect guy to do it, they made a film that feels so fresh, simply by getting away from the tiresome darkness and the shaky-cam violence that is in every film.  Bravo!
B00005JKC3|5.0|This is the first made Hulk on theatre criticized for no reasons. The idea is excellent cos it mix the comics bubble which is a great work and also comes to the first things that brought the Hulk to form. Sure they are plenty of big effects at the end with the father becomes an element but it is a great movie. It's a shame this character won't be in the avenger's movie. Brilliant!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Kirby would be proud!  What film is riskier than this (besides maybe the Human Centipede or something)?  A god in a red cape that comes to earth?  Sounds like He-Man or something, right?  Guess what?  THOR is the source of all that crap.  This is the real deal.  They pulled it off!  Watch it and enjoy!  Great humor, great romance (a lot of people dis the romance, they should watch the interviews pre-release, of the two leads; Portman WAS in love with him.  And if Portman could fall in love with Helmsworth in a few months, Jane couldn't fall in love with a GOD in a few days?  Riiiight....).  Love it!
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|this is a great movie. Of course when u have seen the Xmen you just want to have seen this one in the first place. So to my experience watch this one and then the three Xmen movies!!! Love it purely and simply even if it's not always easy to come back to the Origins.
B0019N94X6|1.0|I am from Colombia, and I can't use the digital copy, so, I lost my money, don't buy this movie if you are not living in USA
B0034G4P80|5.0|this movies is just amazing quality that's why blu ray don't sell much or cos they are not that expensive. No need to view this in 3D in the theatre cos they're nothing to be 3dized ;  fast shipping brilliant sound.
0061992860|4.0|I like this book and its packed with louds of info. It has one problem its small. So for those that have glasses. Well buy it.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|wow the colors and just the effects are amazing. A great fly into the green lantern. If u saw the video comic it takes it and bring it to life with human beeing. A great time u will be blown away on your sit. Great stuff.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Absolutely love, love, love this book!  I have not read anything that drew me in like this in a very long time - I simply could not put it down.  I devour books at a rapid pace and this one was so delicious that I was left wanting for more and immediately purchased the sequel!  I hope I don't die before the third comes out!  It would be tragic to not know how it all ends!  As for the story - I literally felt like I was sitting around a campfire with a melodic voice telling me a very intricate and mesmerizing story - I was enthralled, and held on to every word.  That in itself is saying a lot since most every book I've read has contained passages I knew I didn't need to read (hate fill and fluff).  So...in such cases, you scan the words and get back to the meat of the story.  This did not happen once - I do believe that is a first for me.    The story is extremely well done, with characters that are so well defined that you feel an instant kinship with them all, especially Kvothe - love that guy!  You become so immersed in the story you feel like you are right there alongside Kvothe and his life's journey wondering where it will lead.   I highly recommend this to all, and have told all of my \\"reader\\" friends to get it and relish in the talents of Pat!  Job well done, sir!
B005MVIF7M|4.0|I'm well on my way to a wasted state of being but here goes.  I have been listening to their latest for the last 2+ weeks and it gets better with every listen.  \\"One Sunday Morning\\" has my vote for best song on the album, but other songs on this sonic landscape beg attention. \\"Almost\\" is a rocker par excellence.  This is clearly the best musically talented lineup the band has ever featured.  Fame and fortune and dilligent, brutal hard work have their advantages.  No band on the planet can touch this band right now.  That being said, this is not their best work, although it will probably be the best album released this year, without question.  Nothing can touch it!  But as I write this \\"A Ghost is Born\\" is playing loudly in the background.  A couple of jack and sevens led me to this spot.  I always saw Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and AGIB as almost a double A-side in terms of albums.  Both of these gems were released prior to the Cline-Sansone era.  Yeah, I know their presence was there on the live shows to support AGIB, but Wilco recorded the album without either.  This is no knock on either musician, but the sonic masterpiece(s) that Wilco wrought after the Jay Bennett era of the band are simply beyond compare.  That the band were able to achieve this under all the duress they experienced has already been well documented, photographed, filmed, written about prior to this post.    Wilco is now adding a new lustre to the catalogue of songs this band has released under various incarnations, in their live shows. And they are doing it better live than any band on the planet, if you want to compare catalogue vs. catalogue.  There exists however something fundamental and true in these two albums that are untouchable.  A music fan confronted by these two masterpieces, either for the first time, or through a progression of listens, simply cannot deny this unless they dismiss (their own) soul as immaterial.  This is a great band in its heyday right now.  Don't miss the opportunityto see them on tour.  And don't miss the opportunity to purchase their fine new CD as soon as you get the opporunity. Utilize this aural album experience as a starting point into  a voyage of self discovery, because their oeuvre is true art.  And give them credit - while they were at their seemingly lowest ebb they produced two of the greatest pop albums ever recorded in the history of Western Contemporary Music!
B005G4TJI4|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can!  Special effects are amazing, however the story line is weak compared to the first two movies.  I was a little disappointed by the story and this is my least favorite installment.  Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Just read the subject.  That says it all.  Absolutely perfect!  Would absolutely (and am thinking about) order another one for the television in my room.  Or maybe an HDMI cable.  Hmmmm.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This movie has fantastic animation and a wonderful, playful visual sense.  Our kids love it, as do we.  The dialog is very funny in many places, but it's also written on a level that some of the more introspective existential asides will just go over the kids' heads.  And that's fine.  But there's plenty to like.  This movie is smart, funny and moving, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have tried several Calendar apps, and even abandoned my old steadfast PocketInformant for CalenGoo.  I only wish I would have found this one first!  While best for users who already rely on Google Calendar, this app syncs and updates Google Tasks and Google Calendar seamlessly and without issues and it has many customization options:  colours, backgrounds, fonts -- you can even use Google's Icon set. One of the great benefits of Calengoo are the WIDGETS (numerous to choose from) and the ability to create recurring (and oddly recurring) tasks (great feature no one has!) and appointments/events.  Need to schedule an appointment every 3 weeks on a Monday and Tuesday?  You can do it in Calengoo.  The screenshots don't live up to the simple and attractive look of the program; again ALL colours can be customised  so you can spruce it up for the holidays if you're so inclined).  Great job on this calendar.    (if you don't like Google Calendar - it works with the internal Android calendar as well)

B0058WFO06|5.0|Steven Wilson's much anticipated second solo release \\"Grace for Drowning\\" will not disappoint his loyal and growing audience and will no doubt seduce many new listeners with its artistry, creativity, musicianship and, as with all Mr Wilson's work, exceptional production quality. It is quite simply, a masterpiece, and as such, hard to capture in any meaningful way in a 200 word review. That said, a few words  - first, what it is not - GFD is not a Porcupine Tree album - certainly there are echoes of PT heard here, some common musical roots,but GFD is exquisitely personal in a way that is unique, I think, to this release...hinted at in his first solo release \\"Insurgentes\\" but expanded here.  And in that intensity, it is a record that demands and commands your attention, I find this is not an album to put on shuffle, or listen to in the car on the way to work - no, for me this is a \\"curl-up-with-headphones-shut-the-door-turn-out-the-lights-and-listen-to-me\\" album Ticking in at over 80 minutes, this is no small commitment, but one well worth the investment. I've been a prog fan for years, and cut my musical teeth on Yes, King Crimson, VDGG, Rush, Genesis, Pink Floyd, and of course Porcupine Tree. I've come to expect excellence from all Mr. Wilson's work, whether PT, Blackfield, Bass Communion, or any of his other projects,he gives his best whole-heartedly,surrounds himself with like minded musicians of incredible skill and integrity (and they abound on this album, too!) but he has outdone himself with GFD. Each time I listen to GFD I get new impressions and new favorites, but the initial stand out tracks for me, (as many previous reviews have mentioned) are -  on disc one: Deform to Form a Star, No Part of Me, Remainder the Black Dog (stuck in my head right now...); and on disc two:Belle du Jour, Track One and Raider II (amazing!)  So, gentle reader, I urge you to curl up, plug in your headphones and take this trip, I suspect you will be drawn back many times.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|After seeing this film, I have not viewed meat the same and am careful of what and where I buy meat and fish.  The film is going to thoroughly disgust you with regard to what companies are doing in the production of food, not to mention cruelty to animals.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Pre-ordered this cd back in August and was really looking forward to receiving it.  The CD is great and very upbeat.  Wish he would have released this CD a few years ago.
0749942010|5.0|This book is a page turner that entices the reader to devour each page in search of what happens next.  It is also a beautifully written portrait of human nature and how love and understanding of another human being can transform a life forever. I loved this haunting novel and cannot stop thinking about it.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is my favorite over-all album from the Seattle music explosion. It is still a great listen. Pearl Jam and Soundgarden a great combo.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Reviewing track by track..<br /><br />Mr. Know It All - Mid-tempo, a little understated, but no less powerful than what we have come to expect from Kelly. Her vocals are strong, sassy lyrics, perfect first single to get everyone prepared for the even greater hits to come.<br /><br />What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger) - The confirmed 2nd single and another empowerment anthem. One of the best tracks on the album, it is reminiscent of Since U Been Gone, it makes you want to sing-along, jump, and dance around as she starts the chorus \\"You tried to break me but you'll see..what doesn't kill you makes you stronger!\\"<br /><br />Dark Side - Another mid-tempo track warning of a darker side of herself and asking the guy to embrace her, flaws and all.<br /><br />Honestly - A somber ballad, Kelly has kind of an edge of desperation in her voice as she tells the guy to judge her, love her, hate her, whatever, just as long as you've got the guts to do it honestly.<br /><br />You Love Me - A very intense pop track, it is a little 80's tinged, but not in a bad way. It's lyrics are heartbreaking and breathtaking, it is an immediate standout on the album, and one of my favorites.<br /><br />Einstein - Fun, kinda childish pop track with the diss \\"dumb + dumb = you\\" included.<br /><br />Standing in Front of You - A slow ballad with country/rock vibes to it, it feels a little lackluster compared to the first six tracks, but it does provide a little bit of a breather from the dark, scorned, vengeful, and intense verses of previous tracks.<br /><br />I Forgive You - It opens with \\"I forgive you, I forgive me/Now when do I start to feel again?\\" suggesting forgiveness may not be as easy as it seems. The stacked vocal harmonies really make the track.<br /><br />Hello - A great vocal highlight, its a bouncy pop song with hand claps included. The sound of the song is a lot lighter than the lyrics would suggest.<br /><br />The War is Over - Perhaps my favorite ballad on the album, it is a striking song marked by its pummeling drums and lovely layered vocals. \\"Already Gone\\"'s presence is felt.<br /><br />Let Me Down - Crackling rocky pop with a massive chorus, has definite single potential.<br /><br />You Can't Win - Another favorite of mine, may come as whiny and self-pitying to some but it comes off as honest and powerful to me. Definite highlight.<br /><br />Breaking Your Own Heart - A kind of country, soft rock power ballad, it's not my favorite but Kelly sounds lovely on it.<br /><br />Don't You Wanna Stay - The hit duet from last year, it doesn't really mesh well with the rest of the album, but Kelly shows off her versatility.<br /><br />Alone - I love this song, one of the best on the album and definitely worth buying the deluxe edition for. The chorus makes me want to get up and shout it out loud along with Kelly \\"Cause when I'm with you I'm alone!\\"<br /><br />Don't Be a Girl About It - A funky pop track that is similar to 'I Do Not Hook Up' with a catchier chorus.<br /><br />The Sun Will Rise - Moody, midtempo duet with former Idol judge, Kara DioGuardi. Pleasant closing to the album.<br /><br />Overall this is an awesomely crafted, total Kelly Clarkson experience of an album, it is everything I could have hoped for from her. Her vocals shine, production shines, it is like Breakaway mixed with All I Ever Wanted.<br /><br />Favorite tracks: What Doesn't Kill You(Stronger), You Love Me, You Can't Win, AloneLet Me Down - Crackling rocky pop with a massive chorus, has definite single potential.

B005WWBP1O|5.0|A classic book by a terrific writer.  A great story that is sure to be enjoyed by many.  The characters will capture your attention and you won't want to put it down.  A must read for any generation.
0634089358|5.0|As much as an audience enjoys inventiveness, with the Blues they are looking for authenticity; the rhythm section has to deliver the basics.  The arrangements in this book are true to the versions we all know and love and will give the people what they want.  The bass lines presented are well thought out and move around much more than one might expect (as in \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\").  If you just play them as written, you'd be able to hold the groove down in any Blues bar and be invited back to play again.  The author exposes a rich palette for bass that is graceful, economical and achievable; if you are just beginning it will get you on the right track and if you're a pro coming from another genre it's a reminder that fundamentals win the game.  You get over 20 standards to play with and because they are standard repertoire, everything can be understood in context and applied with confidence. \\"Key to the Highway\\" for instance comes in a very basic line that would work in an acoustic setting, but also contains a version more akin to Carl Radle's take from Derek and the Dominoes.  The text is a useful tool for sharpening bass clef reading skills as well; \\"Messin' with the Kid\\" is a reading exercise disguised as a fun bass line.  It works the key of C for both upper and lower registers.  This allows the player to hear the tonal differences and gently nudges them towards familiarity with the whole instrument right off the bat.  The play-along instrumental only CD made me wish there was a companion volume for guitar, it is so well executed from every aspect.  For a demo CD, it rocks.<br />I am predominantly a guitarist these days, but I started out playing bass and occasionally get asked to gig and record on the instrument.  I felt I needed a refresher for holding down the groove rather than playing over it.  I bought two other Blues bass books at the same time as this one.  I have used all 3 but this was the one I ended up using the most due to its practicality and straightforwardness.<br />Some points to remember:<br />*Very accessible.<br />*Good representation of the standard repertoire.<br />*Clear format and enjoyable to read.forwardness.   Some points to remember:  *Very accessible.  *Good representation of the standard repertoire.  *Clear format and enjoyable to read.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|After hearing some of the advanced cuts, I was expecting some surprises on the entire CD but was very disappointed to find they didnt exist.  Other than the leaked songs everyone has heard, theres only a few ballads and a few instrumentals and a VERY short album as well.  What happened to albums like X&Y that were an hour long?  And the surprises which were included on Viva, the experimental pieces and some of the unique arrangements.  Even though i didnt like them all, some of the songs were truly amazing for an alt band.  But the new CD is just like a collection of homogenized singles and simple ballads.  They dont even come close to their earlier material or even from X&Y or Viva.  I think this CD is going to flop!  Looks like it's only going to sell 1/3 of what Viva did in 2008 which came through with a big BANG AT 720,000 in the first week!  Mylo looks like it's going to debut at number one with around 250,000 copies sold.  I know CD sales are down, but that's a HUGE decline for a band this big!  This one is for loyalists only (who of course like every album by this group no matter what)!  I am loyal to the band but I call a spade a spade!
B000GUJHD0|5.0|Daniel Pink encourages us to use our right brain in meeting and happily greating the challenges of the globalization. Success and creativity abound. Pink is original and fun and funny. You won't be sorry you read this book. I've shared with all my favorite people.

On the Arnova 10G2 tablet I have the missing text, which makes the app on the android tablet annoying and unreadable. Please fix this problem.
B004U7MQXS|5.0|One of the best movies ever starring the best rock band ever. Great product and speedy service. This is highly recommended.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Something about this book kept pulling me in.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there were some typos and even some cringe-worthy actions by the main characters of the book, but that didn't take away from the heart of it.  I fell in love with Abby, the heroine, Travis, the hero and their two best buddies, America and Shepley.  This book was everything I love about true character development.  For better or worse, thick or thin, bad or good, the characters made you want to follow them on their journey of development and growth.    There is usually a danger in writing very long books--I get bored with drawn out, monotony easily. This wasn't the case with Beautiful Disaster.  Because I was so invested in the characters and their lives, I wanted to read every page of their journey.  I've not read the other two books the author has on amazon, but I'm tempted to because of how much of a pleasant surprise Beatiful Disaster was.    Great job!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I love this show. It is my favorite out there. It's smart, funny and interesting. Something exciting is always happening. This season is a perfect addition to the others. Definitely recommend.
0553381687|1.0|This is the worst fantasy series that I have tried to wade through in the last 25 years.  I gave up close to the end of Book 3.  Nothing good ever happens and everyone that you try to pull for in the books are killed or maimed.  Doesn't seem to be going anywhere and there is no plot.
0316067938|5.0|Breaking Dawn was bought so that  when the movie comes out in November I'll know whats going to happen. The book was awesome. It gives more insight into the vampire world. I LOVED IT
0307946711|2.0|Maybe it was because I'd just finished The Marriage Plot and the quality of character development, writing, and general flow just seemed so vastly superior. But, actually, I think not. I think the book was just rather weak. I tried but couldn't get interested in these characters. I found the writing confusingly scattered and disjointed, and the story not all that compelling or original. Rarely do I give up on a book. One Day, though? I'm afraid I actually opted for the United Airlines in-flight magazine instead. It sounds like I'm in a minority, though, and I really don't wish to criticize any writer too much given the tremendous effort involved - hence the two stars. It just wasn't for me.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I love almost all of Nicholas Sparks' older books.  I haven't been as thrilled with the past few and this one really didn't impress me.  The story is same-old same-old.  It's predictable and quite boring.  It feels like he's lost something since A Bend in The Road and The Rescue.

1439153663|3.0|[[ASIN:1439153663 The Kitchen House: A Novel]] is the latest book chosen by my book group.  I found it intriguing and I was eager to find out what happened next as I got rolling with the story.  I am generally not a history buff, nor am I a fan of books about the south although I did love [[ASIN:0143119133 My Name Is Mary Sutter: A Novel]],  [[ASIN:0399157913 The Help Deluxe Edition]] and [[ASIN:0802142842 Cold Mountain]].  While these three had me enthralled, I did not feel the same exhilaration with The Kitchen House.  Perhaps it is because the style of writing did not pull me in.  A  lot of it is told to the reader and things are presented in black and white, good and evil, with no subtleties presented.<br /><br />The story is told in two one-person narratives.  The first one is by an orphaned Irish girl named Lavinia who is held as an indentured servant on a southern plantation.  Her parents died before they could pay their passage to the Americas and Lavinia is taken as payment.  She is settled with the black slaves on the plantation and raised by them.  The other narrative is Belle's, a grown woman, the daughter of the plantation's master and an African-American slave, now deceased.<br /><br />The story takes the reader through Lavinia's life and the ups and downs of the plantation, through crisis after crisis, much like a soap opera.  Things are repeated and the reader doesn't have much of a chance to figure out nuances and gray areas.  While the events are interesting and even exciting at time, I felt I was being talked to rather than engaged with.<br /><br />The story is filled with secrets, shame, mental illness, addiction, cruelty and kindness.  There is something in it for everyone and I must say, that for a debut novel, it shows a lot of promise.  It appears, from the way it ends, that it is set for a sequel.  I actually look forward to it though I am only rating this one a three because of the reasons stated above.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|i never trust the reviews on amazon. people always give it a 1 because they think the developer is giving it positive reviews. then you go to the android market and find the same game, yet there it will have 4-5 stars, such as this one. good game, using a unique twist. i probably wouldnt pay for it but worth it when it is the free app of the day
1575666286|5.0|While this method is a difficult one to stay on you would reap unbelievable health benefits even as a healthy person. Most everyone knows today that you should reduce animal products if not eliminate them. What ever a farmer is forced to inject into an animal does go in you when you eat it; good, bad or indifferent. Eating organic fruits, vegetables, certain grains, fresh juices and sprouts for the major if not complete part of your diet does make you healthier, with more energy. Try growing your own fruits and vegetables so you know what is really in them and make sure to use organic compost for the fertilizer. Remember, if the soil is no good then there is little good in the food that grew in it. So, if you are looking to improve your lifestyle this is the book for you and if you have medical issues I would check out their clinic in Mexico.

B005NJ2K6U|3.0|Nice twist to the overdone 3-in-a-row games.  I can see most people deciding between this game and one of the other 20 games on their phone that Amazon has offered as a free app.  And even though it takes a different approach, it's still a big file (19MB) and I think that is the deal breaker for me.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is great, not only does it have awesome zombies but it also has a really great storyline.  I really got attached to the characters and if your a fan of the comics there are a lot of differences between this and the comics so it keeps you guessing.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|All I can really tell you is that... this movie is beautiful.  It is an absolutely stunning surreal film with an amazing soundtrack and an incredibly thought-provoking story.  I have never, ever seen a movie like this one.  Buying it is more than worth it.  It may or may not change your life.  It probably will.  If you have any issues with the R rating, I can tell you that the violence isn't bad.  I've seen worse in the Lord of the Rings.  But the story, people may have problems with it, and that should be the primary reason for the rating, in my opinion.

B000JMKNJ2|4.0|This is a good story, I am still reading it.  I just think it is well written already and wanted to leave good feedfack for it.  I almost bought the mass market paperback version because the art work on it it is so lovely, but I just find it easier to carry around my Kindle.
B005VYGE64|5.0|This episode grew on me; it did not go as I anticipated. I expected Osiris, a god of judgement, to be stern and forbidding. Instead he had a dark, quirky sense of humor, maybe from a few millenium of watching the absurdities of humanity. He was in fact almost playful, although in a sinister way like a cat with a mouse. His mood was entertainingly unexpected, and it was a nice counterpart to the heavy-duty emphasis on Dean's guilt. But also a nice development of the theme of how Dean always faces up to the dirty work he thinks must be done, even though he feels bad later, and how he shoulders responsibility for the dark aspects of all of their lives.
0756968801|5.0|Scorpia by Anthony Horowitz is one of the amazing books in the Alex Rider series. I would recommend it to anybody who has some time to spare; because once you pick this book up, it might be a while before you set it back down. Also this would be a great book for anybody who wants a nice, action-filled book with unpredictability and excitement around every corner. Also this book will still make sense if you haven't read the rest of the series, as long as you know that Alex Rider is a spy for MI6, who found out in the previous book that his dad was an assassin for a criminal organization known as Scorpia.<br /> In the beginning of Scorpia, Alex goes on a vacation with his friend to Italy. Alex suggests they go to Venice for a little while to relax with the underlying intent to find Scorpia. In Venice Alex spots a boat with a silver scorpion on the front and decides that it must belong to Scorpia. He follows the scorpion around Venice until he finally finds where Scorpia resides. Alex come up with a cunning plan to get in to a party held at Scorpia headquarters and eventually gets caught. Upon being caught, Alex is trapped and left to die in a basement in Venice during a flood, when he escapes and goes in search of more evidence about his father.<br /> Meanwhile, in the criminal organization: Scorpia, a plan is about to go down for a client who wants to rearrange the focus of power in the world, and you will have to red to find out how; but the results will shock the world and change it forever. And Scorpia is willing to carry out the plan at whatever means necessary.<br /> Later, Alex is infiltrating a lab that is linked to Scorpia when he is recognized as his father's son. John Rider, Alex's father, was the best Scorpia had ever had; so Alex is very valuable to them. He is taken to meet with the head of Scorpia where he is shown a film of his father's death by none other than Mrs. Jones, a leader of MI6. Alex is then given the option to join Scorpia or walk away unharmed.<br /> Read Scorpia to find out whom Alex chooses, and the conflict that arises with the people Alex didn't choose. Just expect either choice to have a great story with action and adventure; and be prepared to struggle with putting the book down as Scorpia paints a picture in your mind of the amazing adventure of Alex Rider.ead Scorpia to find out whom Alex chooses, and the conflict that arises with the people Alex didn't choose.

0393338398|5.0|I'm no longer much of a baseball fan, but I loved this book, especially the way a few individuals came to see the game and its statistics in different and revolutionary light. I know this is a stretch, but the book reminds me of the way Einstein, Darwin and other scientists changed the way we see the world.<br /><br />I also loved the mini-biographies of several players who made it to the major leagues even though most scouts thought they wouldn't. Their stories are inspiring.<br /><br />So to me, this book is a beautiful blend of statistics and personalities. In the end, I saw that the two go hand in hand.<br /><br />I did, however, have mixed feelings about the book's central character, Billy Beane. I found him interesting, but I can't say I liked him, even though I appreciated that he tried to run an organization in a new way, a way that was partly born from his own failures as a player. In fact, that's what I found most interesting about this book: the way the ideas of two men who experienced failure and rejection, Beane and Bill James, came together and brought the team with the lowest payroll within a game of the World Series.<br /><br />There are several compelling themes to this book. It's certainly multi-dimensional, as there are different levels to it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are great headphones all around! Dont pay extra money for brand name for $450 headphones, these sonys are high quality. Must buy.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|A friend recommended the book to me, warning me that it was a bit creepy but really, really good. She was right! I loved the voice the author used - that of a 5 year old child. Using Jack's voice and innocence, she was able to convey the horror his mother endured, without having to be graphic. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop. And when it ended, I looked for more... reading even some of the group discussion questions and answers at the end. Highly recommended!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I love this! The price is exceptional for the product. It has very strong velcro that will not come off!

B005I64U5C|1.0|Under NO condition, this is a review of the movie. It is the review of the product (Green Lantern 3 Disc Edition version)<br /><br />Now that we have that out of the way; I enjoy superhero movies and it is one of them. The movie is great.<br /><br />However I do hate the new Ultraviolet Flixster digital movie delivery medium.<br />The absolutely painful process to create 'yet another' login and then going through authentication process, downloading movies.<br />Watsed 20 minutes on this and after all this to not be able to play my movie? You may understand my frustration.<br />Whoever thought of UV Flixster, must be one of those guys who think they are the next Zuckerberg or something.<br /><br />Here are the flaws:<br />1. You cannot play the Flixster movies on any of the digital tablets or phones \\"offline\\". You HAVE to be connected to the internet as it streams.<br />2. Worse is that it will not even play on the PC (Yes, on Windows PC).<br />The extremely colorful dotted circle just keeps changing colors (and so do I with anger), when nothing happens for 15 minutes.<br />And I have let it run for a while (45 minutes). \\"Bad Dobby\\".<br /><br />The movie is great, but save your money and buy the Blu Ray ONLY edition.<br />You are better off spending money on the iTunes, or Zune, or Amazon (depending upon what you like), and not get the digital copy.

B005F3XV62|4.0|I am a big Kevin James fan and also love those silly \\"animals can talk\\" type movies. I thought this was really cute and I enjoyed it. Kevin James plays the usual funny chubby guy that you cant help but to love. Dont take this movie to seriously. Just enjoy it for the many funny laughs and the in general silliness. Dont expect a complicated story line. Just enjpoy Kevin James doing his thing and appreciate the cuteness of the talking zoo animals. Good for kids and adults. A nice  clean comedy:)
630469654X|4.0|Had never heard of this movie until I rented it two days ago. I thought it had a really good story, something which is often lacking in movies these days. The fantasy and romance aspects were, I thought, well done. In the end, the curse is undone, the bad guy gets his dues, and the lovers are reunited!  I thought the acting of the male lead (Rutger Hauer) was a little understated. But then, it was SO refreshing to see a movie like this that wasn't full of arguing, yelling, and stupid, overdone special effects.   The only irritating aspect is the character of Phillipe. Early in the movie, he talks too much, far more than a man on the run would. But his character improves as the story goes on.  Good entertainment, especially if you like medieval-style fantasy.

The sound went out in both earpieces and i could not use the mic. i found the problem to be bad wiring. this being said the 3 months i had them they worked great. i could hear people coming up on me and they saved my live many times in game (on PS3). even though they broke i am still willing to buy from turtle beach again. right now i am looking to buy the turtle beach px3 or trittons Ax 720. I read from reviews many people had trouble with the wiring on the px21 so i'm going to try going wireless to fix the problem.

0446556750|3.0|Mostly a Mickey Haller story with Bosch as a support character using determination and police skills to come to the rescue with no time to spare. Not in the for front but appearing here and there.  A good court room drama, interesting characters, but light on Bosch. I like the Haller character but not as much as Bosch in The Scare Crow, The Last Coyote, The Narrows, City of Bones, and the Closers.  With Haller Connelly is moving beyond the raw and gritty Bosch and the mean streets of LA to a more sophisticated and socially acceptable character in Haller and the court room.   I give it three stars for a court room drama.

B005YVSIZ4|5.0|I cried during the entire 2nd episode. I'm not a fan of watching things that make me cry, but it worked for this one episode. The actors in this show are amazing. I was really hoping Glenn would meet Maggie in the episode. He did see her quickly and I LOVEEEEEDD how they introduced her to Glenn. I can't wait for next week because I think they'll be together and things will start moving along with them. I love the idea of happier times mixed in with such terrible (but awesome to watch) times. I also love how they end each episode with a cliffhanger. Man, I can't wait for next week! I'm really losing my mind in anticipation. If I die before I get to see how this show ends I'm going to crawl my way back to earth as a ghost just so I can see it.
B00002E23E|3.0|A great performance, unfortunately undermined by a director and editor who think the movie is about them. The \\"dramatic\\" sequences are moronic in the extreme, and it's amazingly annoying to have the camera cut away from the performance to such pointless scenes as a bridge going by from a car. As though a band of this caliber and power needs some kind of visual support to make it interesting. . .  And even when they do allow us footage of the performance, there are a number of places where the visuals and the sound are completely unrelated---not just out of sync but Jimmy Page playing some other song than the song we're listening to.  It's worth getting for the performance, if you can tolerate all the nonsense you have to wade through to get to it.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|It boils down to this....more of he same....rejoice! These musical badasses have been making killer albums for days and this is no exception. People....it's not gonna be Seas of Cheese ok? However, what we have here is a great album that will make you smile, laugh, and ask yourself \\"WTF?\\". Ya know...like every other Primus album right? My analogy, if you will, is this: this is the movie that the genius director makes without the Oscars in mind. I would describe this it as a hybrid of Frizzle Fry, Punchbowl, and Seas of Cheese. It has no summer singles or any other frilly BS....but it is a sort of retrospective conglomeration of classic Primus! I highly recommend this to any old school Primus fan....and to any other knuckleheads who have never experienced their sound. I love this album!!!! Primus sucks!
B005IS565S|5.0|This album is amazing and the best FFDP cd yet!  American Capitalist is a hardcore explosion of awesome guitar riffs and angst driven lyrics
B0055EAJ7A|4.0|To be fair, I am NOT a huge Thor fan.  I probably hadn't thought much about the character since I was a kid 40 years ago.  I do follow some old and new comics/story lines and I had a general idea who Thor was, but that is all.  So, to me, this was a decent movie.  I am not one to compare every detail of a 2 hour long movie to a 50 year comic franchise.  As a stand alone movie and introduction to the characters, I thought it worked well.  It was not overly serious and at least the movie got going with some action early on.  A big problem in a lot of these super-hero movies is that you have to create the hero, get the cast of characters together, etc.  While I am not a big CGI fan, the effects here were, for the most part, good and not dark and murky.  Still the blue/grey skinned villians looked to be rip offs from Avatar's characters.  As you can expect, its set up for an obvious sequel.
0385534639|5.0|This book is simply MAGICAL.  The characters were very real... the love story develops beautifully, interwoven into the very fabric of the circus itself.  I can't remember the last time I was so completely lost inside the world of a story.   A few months back, there was an NPR list for people who were sad that Harry Potter was over...for the graduates of Hogwarts - this book belongs on such a list.    My only complaint is that it's over.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I wanted to also voice my opinion as has everyone else about this digital copy from Flixster/UltraViolet.  I have been buying the digital copies with all my BD collections; mostly so I don't have to  rip them myself and it is just easier to have an Itunes/Windows Media version easily available.  But, this version of digital copy is in my opinion a waste of the consumer's time.  I do not agree that a cloud based solution to a digital copy I specifically purchased to play on my Ipad/Iphone is the right answer.  I, like everyone else realized after the fact that it does say UltraViolet Digital Copy, but how many of us actually knew what it meant.  For someone like me that has literally over 600 movies and the last 30 or 40 I have bought with a digital copy I would never have thought that a company would change what a Digital Copy actually represents to the consumer.  In my humble opinion this is misleading advertisement and something should be done to rectify the situation.  I should be able to return the version I purchased or at least refund the difference between the normal BD and the BD with the Digital Copy.

B005ELQVGW|1.0|Another awful CD? After we waited for so long! The success of Volta was a culmination of her previous OUTSTANDING work, Volta is so bad and this one is really really bad. Barely any energy and excitement in and sound like Volta meets Drawing Restraint 9 (wherever that was)but watered down several times. How disappointing...   Bjork! Sweet Girl, your previous work still brings me to tears by its overwhelming beauty and expressiveness, after I have heard it literally hundreds of times \\"I am a fountain of blood in a shape of a girl, u r a bird on the rim hypnotized by the whirl.....\\"OMG!!!!!!! ......Breathtaking videos too! Enough of your breaks, PLEASE find inspiration again and COLABORATE with better musicians.  Still loving you and holding on to the hope that you will get back to your SELF, Boris  P.S. I haven't played with the graphic side of the CD, just wanted amazing music. I am not a gamer. So one * for being cutting edge all though not musically.
B003UESJGA|5.0|This movie provides an authentic feel for life in the 60's in England.  Fords at Dagenham was the only major employer in the area and was not unlike other employers in the way it treated and rewarded it's female employees.  This movie really captures the reality of the impact of industrial action on a family, the tensions within between those on strike and those kept out of work when there is no income.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Very descriptive book that explains how the North Koreans are taught from an early age that they are the privileged and that there is \\"nothing to envy\\" anywhere else. Most don't have any idea what life is like anywhere else. This book interviews 6 people about their lives after having defected to South Korea. I couldn't put it down and several times I had to re-read because I thought I must have misunderstood. It's unbelievable.

030788743X|2.0|No where in any review or article about Ready Player One did I read that it was a young adult novel. And not even a good young adult novel.   Proof? Type of page into Word and see what reading level it comes up with!  I read on my Kindle and highlight nice passages. When looking over this thing after finishing it I didn't highlight one nice description or intelligent turn of phrase. Simply not good writing.  As for the plot. It was ok. A simple adventure story. There's nothing wrong with that. There should be more of them. However, as I noted to myself at 16% of the way into the book, the adventure hasn't even started. I wrote \\"Didn't The Hobbit get started on chapter 2?\\" After a slow start was plotted nicely and had a couple cute 80s references which to this guy (born 1970) got tiring.  Another problem I had was that the real world he describes was just not realistic. He describes the protagonist as being fat and doesn't get exercise. However, the protagonists lives in a 20 high stack of trailers outside Oklahoma City (I think it was). If a kid is climbing up and down that all day, that's exercise and he's probably not fat! Also, why would they build a 20 high stack of trailers in a windswept area? Show me a 3rd world country where they do this?   There were other problems - at the end our protagonist learns a friend isn't who they say they were. However, instead of some discussion on the essence of identity in a digital world we get a trite After-school special treatment of \\"It's what's on the inside that matters\\". Come on!  This book will soon be forgotten.

1934030198|5.0|In my opinion, the goal of this book is to give people who want to compete in triathalons a scientific, self-coached training plan. Does it deliver? Absolutely. The book accomplishes this through six, cleanly divided parts.<br /><br />PART ONE, \\"The self-trained triathlete\\" is concerned with the \\"philosophical\\" basis for methodical training. It deals with things such as attitide and commitment, which are as important as physical training. PART TWO, \\"From lab to real world\\" talks about the scientific foundation of training and goes into the science and priciples of training (i.e. progressive resistance, periodization, etc.). PART THREE, \\"Training with a purpose\\" pulls together parts one and two in which a system of purposeful training is described. This part will help the reader to determine exactly what their training needs are and the best ways to address them. PART FOUR, titled \\"Planning\\" helps you design your own training plan for a season, week by week. PART FIVE, \\"Racing and recovering\\" takes you through the details of preparing to race and recovering after - it gives you info on what to do before and after the actual race. This information is essential as many athletes neglect to recover properly before starting training again for the next race.  PART SIX, \\"The competative edge\\" talks about supplemental aspects of training that can contribute to peak performance such as swimming tips, weight training ex's, eating tips, etc. - kind a of \\"tie up the loose ends\\" section.<br /><br />A book that truly lives up to its name, I can't see many readers coming away from this book without picking up much useful information - from the beginner to the experienced. Athletes who have shoulder trouble that interferes with their training might also find [[ASIN:1457527243 Bulletproof Your Shoulder]] helpful too. Happy training!oo. Happy training!
0439023513|5.0|At first I have to say I was disappointed. Since a lot of reviews already contain spoilers, I am not going to hide any detail. The protagonist doesn't follow the typical heroine defeat the bad guy and save the world formula. Instead, she was torn when she realized the side she has been fighting for is as viscous as the enemy. There is no winner. A lot of innocent people lose their lives. The weapon invention of \\"one of her boyfriends\\" kills her sister even it is just an accident. The heroine never really loves either of them as she is not ready to fall in love. Yet people all around her expect her to return their love and becomes one of their lover. The author paints a picture of human nature when survival instinct dictate. There is no super vampire power or unreal love.<br />The more I think about the story, the more I love it. We all have some point in our time have experience similar situation. There is no absolute. Paradigm can shift and the one we think we love a can turn into some strangers. I applaud the author's bravery to think outside of the box and refuses to follow other novels.<br />I am also happy at the end Peeta finally won Katniss' love even thought it wasn't a fair tale ending.
B004J4WKDI|4.0|I've been reading some of the other reviews for this book. Whether this book is for you will depend on what you are looking for. There were some complaints about it being too descriptive and not enough character development. I myself usually hate over descriptive writing, however, I found this one to be an exception. The descriptions were for the intent of making you feel like you were there in person. It is about sights and senses and they are wonderful. I felt I could really see, hear and smell what the characters were experiencing. It is fanciful fun and a great getaway from reality. If you are looking to compare this to a literary masterpiece then this may not be for you. I loved this book; try a sample and judge for yourself.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B005NJ2K6U|4.0|This is a fun game but I liked the original better.  This one has to stop after the first part and download the second part of the game...and that takes a while.  The puzzles aren't symmetrical so if you are used to being able to spin pieces to get matches, no go.  I HATE the puzzles at the end of each section you have solve to finish the 100%.<br /><br />I wish they had just created more puzzles for Gem Spinner 1.  I gave this 4 stars because it's a fun game, but more style over substance...more puzzles for the first one PLEASE!

0300169787|5.0|Silly me, I waited until the very last night of the McQueen exhibit at the Met to go. And then I stood in line, by myself, for 4  hours. I got really, really well acquainted with the exhibits the line snaked by. I stood there sweating in the hot galleries. And, around 1 a.m., I finally got to see the exhibit -- and it was worth all of the waiting. The Met always does an incredible job with its costume exhibits, but this was really a step above the rest, and the McQueen pieces displayed were, of course, stunning.<br /><br />This coffee table book is a great way to experience the exhibit, if you missed it (it is also great for making people jealous, if you saw it and they didn't). The front cover is a gorgeous hologram, and the photos and stories really capture each piece. This is also excellent to supplement the exhibit experience, if you were unable to read all of the plaques fully (which, toward the end of the exhibit's run, I doubt many people had the patience to do). Overall, a stunning book.

So you have between 11/11/11 and 12/29/11 to buy these movies. I'm sure in the next year or two they will release an Ultimate Collection and they will charge you a fortune for it. I don't want to wait that long. By taking all the movies off the shelf now, they can sell that version for whatever they want, whenever they deem it appropriate to release it. I'll buy this collection now, thank you. At least I'll have a copy of all the movies...  Press release came out 10/25/11. Google it.

B0058N2T3K|5.0|Firstly, I knew about this UK release before the announced release of the single disc, double movie edition of Nightmare on Elm Street 2 and 3.  So, I didn't purchase that.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the list of extra features included on this set, and even more pleasantly surprised to find all the old Nightmare Encycolopedia features on the disc as well.<br /><br />Well, beyond having 'decent' but way better than dvd quality transfers on these films, the big hook for this set is a fifth disc, a dvd, of ALL NEW special features, most prominently a retropspective doc on the entire Nightmare series.  Very cool.  Wish it was a blu ray, but at the end of the day it really doesn't matter tha much.  We also get two episodes of Freddy's Nightmares on this fifth disc.  The weird thing about this is that the two episodes are not Freddy Krueger-centric episodes.  What the hell is up with that?  The pilot episode was a great one directed by horror legend Tobe Hooper(ORIGINAL Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist, Eaten Alive).  This episode was basically a short prequel to the first Nightmare on Elm Street film and told Freddy's backstory including his trial and eventual succumbing to mob justice.  There were about three more Freddy starring episodes where he was just the villain and they're not the two included either.  Makes no sense.  Most of Freddy's Nightmares episodes weren't that good.  At least with a release of the movie franchise some in cannon episodes would've made sense.  I get the feeling Warner Brothers is gearing up to release the Freddy's Nightmares seasons soon and they know if people have the Freddy starring episodes already they probably won't buy the whole seasons.  I could be wrong.<br /><br />Disc one is a repeat of the already released first Nightmare film with all the previously released blu ray's special features.  Disc 2 has parts 2 and 3 and ALL the special features of the recently released American version of this same disc....same pretty good to decent transfer as well.  Better yet disc 3 has parts 4 and 5, and disc 4 has Freddy's Dead and New Nightmare on them, all with the various Nightmare Encyclopedia special features seperated for each film.  Very cool.  Can finally get rid of my old dvd box set and get some store credit.<br /><br />Like I said the transfers are better than DVD but not great.  The films have not been remastered and there's not a ton of digital noise reduction(which is a good thing, and yes I'm looking at you Predator blu ray).  Weirdly enough the first two films look the best on blu ray.  If you have the first Nightmare you already know how good it looks, its the same disc here verbatim.  It's a good transfer with good sound.  While Nightmare 2 doesn't have the same great sound it does have a crisp atmospheric transfer.  The rest of the films look good and better, but not a showcaser for you HD TV or blu ray player....but then again they're low budget horror so why would you pick them to do any kind of showcasing?<br /><br />Finally, you get a nifty Freddy Krueger comic book and a medium thick white blu ray case with Freddy tearing out of the front cover.  You will not have copies of the hopefully forgotten remake or Freddy VS. Jason in this package.  I have them on blu ray sooooo....I will live but it would've been cool to at least have the VS movie included.  I paid very little for this and it looks better enough to warrant the upgrade for me.  The new special features are mostly fun and grat with the exception of the bafflingly chosen Freddy's Nightmares episodes they did include.  This is worth the price.<br /><br />Also, for you major Nightmare geeks out ther the old late 80's MTV special is on the fifth disc as well and this sucker really brought pack some memories for me.  NOW, if only Paramount would take the hint and finish releaseing the Friday the 13th films after part 3 OR just give us a blu ray box set and stop making even more dvd versions.  Same goes for New Line.Why are they being so stingy with Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X?  Gotta finish out the franchise....ya'know?Hell and Jason X?  Gotta finish out the franchise....ya'know?
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|This game is tired and boring. If you are new to casual gaming, as in born yesterday, you might enjoy this. But making the same game over and over again but calling it something else is crap. Does nothing different than the hundreds of games it copied from. Booo!
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|I played the original and thought #2 would be fun, but got scared by the list of permissions.  For one, why the hell does it NEED to modify battery statistics?  Is there something that needs hiding?
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Great movie. Awesome 3D effects. Worth every penny. I wish they made more 3D movies that had this good of an effect. Most of them leave me very disappointed.
B004ZIHYXO|4.0|I like this very much.  I exercise to the music and enjoy the beat of the music.  Since it's a \\"rap\\" CD, and by Pitbull,  you can understand the words. It's great a very good CD.  To anyone who likes this type of music, I'd recommend it.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I'm suprised at all the bad reviews - or maybe not.  People love to hate on stuff that is popular.   People with no imagination (Im guessing 99% of the 1 star reviews) are really gonna hate this cause they lack grey matter upstairs and need everything spoonfed to them. Very slowly and with lots of CGI. (aka SAW lovers)  But for people who enjoy 'things that go bump in the night' this movie delivers.  The reason Im here praising this movie is because after all the 'found footage' movies made, the majority of them are bad (Yes, even the BWP) - so I went into this movie ready to bomb it.  By their 4th night, the smug look was wiped off my face, at the Ouija board scene the movie had my full attention.  Suspension of disbelief. Either you have it or you dont, and that is what is going to have you enjoying or hating this movie (well, that, and an imagination)
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|The app runs well with NO force closes.  The game itself is like any other match 3 game but is still a great way to kill some time.

0738711500|4.0|This was the first book I bought when I decided I wanted to learn how to read tarot cards. It seemed like a good choice for a beginner like myself. It's a great introduction to tarot and the author does a good job of explaining the meanings of the cards. Plus, it comes with the Gilded Tarot deck and the artwork is absolutely beautiful in my opinion.  The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five was because I think as an introduction, it's great, but I still want to learn more, and I don't think I can get any further in learning tarot with just this book alone.  Also, I would have loved if there were more spreads in the book. There were a few good ones, and I particularly liked The Cross of Truth spread, but there was one spread at the end I couldn't even do because it required TWO decks of cards. And seeing as how this was my first book, of course I only had just the one deck.  Overall though, it's a great book. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to start their journey to learning tarot. :)
B0031CO3WA|4.0|We have had the Schleich airplane for almost a year now and my boys(ages 4 and 2) play with it a lot.  We have a lot of Schleich items(the Animal Nursery, Expedition Truck, Corrals, and tons of animals), and they all get lots of use.  While there are some quality issues(I have superglued), the plane is still in decent shape and fully usable.  The wheels will pop off if you press too hard, but they are easy to put back on.  It would be nice if all of the Schleich \\"big items\\" held together a little better, but I would say that overall given the amount of time they are played with and the fact that my 4 year old just asked for another plane (so they both can have one), makes this toy worth it.

The bad news is that he's going to die right along with all of the rest of us when Doomsday rolls around next Saturday.<br /><br />By the way, there is no Rapture so don't think you're going to be able to settle down with a bowl of popcorn and watch the rest of us descend to Everlasting Torment.<br /><br />What are some of the signs that Armageddon is almost upon us?<br /><br />-Agnes Nutter predicted it<br /><br />-An Archangel (technically he's a Principality) and a rather famous snake band together to prevent it<br /><br />-Someone misplaced the Anti-Christ (technically the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness)<br /><br />-Atlantis rises out of the ocean and strands a cruise ship on its main plaza<br /><br />\\"Good Omens\\" is an extremely funny look at the End of the World--not in the gut-busting, laugh-out-loud style of a Dave Barry (at least not for me)--but in the best dead-pan, Monty Pythonesque 'take a normal object and rotate it into the wrong dimension' tradition. All of the main characters are loveable, earnest, and in some cases bumbling-- even the Witch-finder Sargeant. There are a couple of despicable (but bumbling) demons, and the Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are flat-out evil. The latter inhabit all of the truly scary corners of this book, but for the most part it is cross-eyed, cock-a-hoop, British tongue-firmly-in-cheek funny.<br /><br />And the Snake doesn't have _all_ the lines. Agnes Nutter, the Adversary (Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness),Aziraphale (technically a Principality), the 'hoor of Babylon', and the Witch-finders Sargeant and Private get in a few good ones, too.<br /><br />\\"Good Omens\\" is a classic.<br /><br />Metatron says you've got to read it.<br /><br />Before next Saturday.

B000SEH80I|5.0|I first read this book in 2002 when I was 23 and it changed my life.  I didn't have the worst parents by any stretch, but reading this book pretty much single-handedly helped show me how to stop being a victim and actually resolve things with my parents.<br /><br />I just re-read it 7 years later and it's amazing how much I have grown since. I would recommend this book to anyone, particularly people in their early- to mid-20s who had unhappy childhoods.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I really enjoyed the first game, and am mighty impressed by this follow up! It's smoother and visually gorgeous. It runs perfectly on Droid 3.  I'm not sure if the addition of a story was needed, but also gives a nice backdrop to the gameplay.   To the haters: I must say, the constant complaints on every FAotD are getting old. Ooooh, it asks for permissions so that it can properly run and you don't understand them--It must be a conspiracy! Ooooh, the file size is bigger than apps that are far more simple and less fun--boo hoo! I have a crappy phone, and it can't run this game--Waaaa!   Soon enough, someone will surely one-star it, just because they feel the need to &quot;balance out&quot; any good ratings. You people are a joke and your first-world problems sicken me. Thank you, both to Amazon and the Dev for this FREE game for me to play, while I am blessed enough to play games on my cellphone.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|11-11-11  Heeding the advice of another reviewer, I checked Amazon UK and not only can you get the Harry Potter with all 8 films, but at 25.50 pounds, that equates to roughly $41.00 American; even with shipping it's not only cheaper, but you get the final film to boot.  Please note, it is a pre-order; delivery is expected to be 12-2 (UK).  I just have to figure out how to order and set up delivery, but I will try and let you know what I find out.  earlier post:  Warner Bros. announced today that after December 29th no HP videos will be available; they're going to pull a Disney, where every 7 years they re-release one of the classics in the newest format. I wonder if the type of set you're speaking of will be released for the holidays only??

This book has given me a greater appreciation for Steve Jobs and Apple products. Thank you SJ. RIP.

B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Because of the large number of reviews which are either downrating this app because of issues with Amazon (rather than the app) or the too-common misunderstanding of how permissions work on Android, I'm giving this 5 stars.  Every single permission requested by this app has a necessary purpose for one feature or another, and it really is getting ridiculous that so many are downrating every other app on the market because they don't have a clue what the permissions actually mean and why they would be needed.  For example, \\"Read phone state and identity\\" is needed to pause the game when a phone call comes in.  That's what \\"reading phone state\\" is.  Blame Google for putting \\"...and identity\\" on that.  As for the guy who downrated it for accessing the battery log (to assist with power efficiency), what nefarious purpose do you imagine could be achieved with this?
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|keeps locking up my phone.  i have to pull the battery and reboot.  loved the first version but this one is unresponsive and unstable.  need to go back to the drawing board on this one.  glad i didnt pay $2 for thos worthless app.  samsung epic 4g.

B002ZG993Q|3.0|The book (published lately as [[ASIN:B004P5OPPM The American: A Special Edition of A Very Private Gentleman]] is a beautifully-written appreciation of life in Italy with a complex and not particularly likable protagonist, interrupted by annoying chase scenes. The movie is the chase scenes, with okay cinematography. George Clooney is not well cast as an extremely buttoned-up character who finds relationships difficult. Buy the book, skip the movie.

B005I64U5C|1.0|Ultraviolet.Flixter is the worst kind of ripoff. I ordered Green Lantern in 3D with a digital copy. I like to watch movies on my iPad while on cross country flights. I returned the first copy because I was unable to download the website.On the second copy the site loaded but there was no app for anything. I attempted to download the movie and was told I had to wait until 12/20. It also appears that you do not actually get a digital \\"COPY\\" you get streaming privileges which are useless without a high speed connection. I will never buy any movie with the Flixter/Ultraviolet connection again. I will save the money and get it later on iTunes.

B00002DEGZ|1.0|\\" . . . . . and I would like to say to the Board of Enquiry that this ghastly episode brings to mind the Mary Celeste, the brigantine merchant shop that was found adrift in the middle of the Atlantic. To this day, she remains the archetypal ghost ship.\\"<br /><br />\\"You had better explain yourself here!\\" the First Lord of the Admiralty thundered.<br /><br />\\"Your Honour, the Mary Celeste was discovered in late 1872, unmanned and apparently abandoned (one of the lifeboats was missing).  Adding to the mystery, the weather was clement and her crew had been experienced and able seamen. As found, the vessel was seaworthy and under sail with the winds pushing her towards the Strait of Gibraltar. There was plenty of food and water on board. Her cargo - a shipload of pure alcohol - was untouched. The personal possessions and valuables of the passengers and crew were still in place. Not one of them was ever seen or heard from again. Their fate has generated much speculation. Theories range from `alcoholic fumes, to underwater earthquakes, to waterspouts, to paranormal explanations involving extraterrestrial life, unidentified flying objects (UFOs), sea monsters, and the phenomenon of the Bermuda Triangle', although the Mary Celeste had kept her distance from that ill-fated region. The episode has been cited as the greatest maritime mystery of all time - until today.\\"<br /><br />I sipped away at my water. My lawyer surreptitiously kicked me under the table. After a moment's pause, I continued.<br /><br />\\"Sir, we came across the SS Bilson-Gardiner after a long search. She was still seaworthy - there was not a drop of water in her hold. We boarded at K 456 in B Flat. Lanterns in hand, we then moved on to K 466 and K 467, which received a rosette from the Penguin Guide. It was getting dark by the time we reached K 271.

1439153663|5.0|This was a well-written book that was almost investigative reporting about the horrors of slavery and indentured servitude.  Although slavery was a terrible historical period in our country, the slaves showed great courage, loyalty, and love to their owners and to each other.  The cultural differences in the owners and slaves were huge, but common humanity was shining through as evidenced by the thread of kindness that ran through the mozaic of their lives.  A white indentured servant was less than a landowner and his family, but far more than a slave.  This book has it all!

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I already have the whole set of Star Wars DVD and expect this Bluray set should be better than DVD in every aspect. Not so. Yes, the box is well designed and beautiful, the sound is noticably improved particularly in the early episodes like the first film, Episode IV.  The major, major fallback is the extremely long loading time on ordinary bluray player. I'm using a Denon mid-level player and it takes around 5 minutes from the insertion of disc to the real movie starts. The DVD takes 30 seconds.  There are obvious enhancement of the image quality but this improvement often uncovered a lot of the visual effect fault, so the film does not look as natural as in a DVD.  I'm not very impressed.

0345529057|5.0|I used to read Raymond Feist books, but after 8 books or so I totally lost interest in his ability to tell a story and keep me entertained.  These books are totally different.  I can't tell you how happy I was to find that the actual book is cheaper than the Kindle version.  I still like reading a book, having it in my hand etc.  But I bought a Kindle because of the amount of space my book collection had been taking, and now I get to read an actual book again.  I won't bore with details, but in short I can say the following:  Don't get attached to any one character.  The good guys and bad often change, and your opinion of them is based on shades of their actions....nobody is innocent in this series.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Wow. I am really shocked how much I like Mylo Xyloto. I am a long-time Coldplay fan and just love their music, but I wasn't sure about this record due to the slight change in style. The first half of the record I was mostly familiar with due to the singles, live versions and the side A sampler. The only song on side B that I had heard was Major Minus. Obviously, the second part of the record was what I was looking forward to the most as it was mostly new, unheard Coldplay!  I can definitely see why this record has fans divided. It is a new sound for Coldplay in terms of production and direction. However, there are many tracks where 'early' Coldplay is still there, just under new layers. Utimately, I gave the record a 4/5, with a point deducted for some unnecessary over-production. I do truly feel it deserves it though. It is a good mix of all the previous records, while still moving forward.  Mylo Xyloto:  Just beautiful. I love this as the opening track and the transition into Hurts Like Heaven. Although, I am with others who have said it's hard to listen to just MX or HLH by themselves...  Hurts Like Heaven:  Probably the track I was most fearing as I love the live version and people were saying it was so different on the record. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not crush my enjoyment of the track! I LOVE this song! Yes, it is a bit over-produced, but I also think that makes it interesting. There are so many sounds and layers to the track that a good set of headphones brings out.  Paradise:  No surprises here. The second single. It's definitely a grower. I liked it when I first heard it, but the introduction is just fantastic the more I listen to it. It fits so well on the record now I have heard it in context.  Charlie Brown:  This is my favourite track on the record. It is such a great track and should definitely be released as the next single! The piano part at the end is just fantastic. This will be a big hit and crowd-pleaser!  Us Against The World:  LOVE! This is such an amazing song! I adore the introduction. I loved this track live and this version just makes it all the better. Only quip is I wish Will's duet portion was more pronounced. The first song on the record that sounds like 'early' Coldplay material.  M.M.I.X.:  This instrumental makes Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall flow within the context of the record. If this was not here, it would be such an abrupt change from UATW.  Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall:  Again, no surprises. The first single and a really upbeat and optimistic song. It is pretty dancey for Coldplay, but it's a great song nonetheless.  Major Minus:  I had already heard this from the Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall EP. It's a fantastic track and really like it. I would have preferred less distortion on the verse vocals, but Jonny's guitar solo is awesome!  U.F.O.:  This is such a lovely acoustic track and reminds me so much of 'early' Coldplay. The melody is great, but I just wish it was a tad bit longer.  Princess of China:  I was really surprised by this one! First, Rihanna being on the track is strange. I think this might be one of her better vocal performances though. The song itself is very RnB to me, but I don't mind it. I am surprised to be honest as I was going in thinking I was going to really dislike it, but I think if this is released as a single, it will probably be a big hit. However, it's definitely one of my least favourite tracks on the record.  Up In Flames:  I really didn't think I was going to like this song. I had heard a clip of the Austin City Limits live version and it just didn't do anything for me. However, within the context of the record and with the added production (think Massive Attack style beat), I think this is a good track. Again, it reminds me of 'early' Coldplay but it's not up to par with the rest of the album. I consider this track and Princess of China to be the low point of the record really.  A Hopeful Transmission:  Probably the best instrumental on the record. It's basically a more upbeat 'Mylo Xyloto' with a sort of Latin vibe. It flows so well into Don't Let It Break Your Heart.  Don't Let It Break Your Heart:  Wow. One of my favourite tracks!  As with Hurts Like Heaven and Major Minus, I wish there wasn't as much distortion on Chris' voice, but really that's the only negative I see on this stellar track!  Up With The Birds:  A fantastic closer! Again, like 'early' Coldplay but with a modern twist. It starts so atmospheric, I had no clue what direction it was going to go! It's a beautiful track and such a great way to close the record!
B005YVSIZ4|4.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****  I watch this show because I want to see zombies. I didn't see any the first half of this episode and that is a problem. A zombie show with great characters is awesome. But just a character show with some zombies thrown in isn't really worth my time. That's just regular TV and I'll eventually stop watching. Might as well be shopping at the mall to see as much social and family drama play out as the melodrama we had to wade through here.      The move from Carl getting shot to getting medical care and introducing new characters took all of ninety seconds. Well done. Most of it played out nicely between the episodes actually, and that was fine, as it moved the story right along. And then it hit a brick wall in the form of Rick's continued weird parenting decisions. Your kid needs Type A transfusions and you're the only source. Even if you could leave, why would you? Stay by the bedside in case he wakes up again. I get he's concerned and overwrought but seriously that makes no sense. Nor does Lori whining to the only medical man available, \\"have you done this before?\\" Does it matter? Carl is either dead or has a slight chance. So an idiot shot your son. You let your son go wander off into zombie infested woods instead of staying in a cleared area. Who, really, is the idiot here? It was a mistake to cram all of that into a single episode. Drawing it out over two or more would have been better, substituting in some flesh eaters instead.     On the other hand, I must say I like the flashbacks to the day Rick was shot. Said it before and I'll say it again, I want to see how exactly society broke down as zombies, \\"the epidemic\\", overtook these peoples' everyday lives. To me that's the key where TWD can distinguish itself from others in the genre. Not a small pocket of resistance (Night of the Living Dead) or well after the fact (28 Days Later); show us the play-by-play of reality crumbling into this funky new surrealism. On that note, whenT-Dog saw the carseat splattered with blood, MAN, that was the most disturbing image I've seen in awhile. Speaking of him, thank you, writers, for illustrating his moniker (Theodore Douglas) and spelling out in his fever-induced delirium what we've been wondering since last season: what are the long term survival prospects for this group, anyway?     Lastly, here's a freebie of common sense. Two guys need to clear an area of walkers to search it. They drive up in a pickup. Just send one guy driving in slightly faster than a zombie can shamble to lead them away. They're not intelligent, they'll follow bait; they don't need to be tricked. Certainly two guys with no armor don't really need to risk themselves searching when one driver can just draw off the pack. It's like no one in this show has actually had a group discussion on survival techniques. Brainstorm! Instead, it always goes this way: we need something, you couple of people will go for it even though these people over here oppose the idea for sound and rational reasons. Take only one weapon each and under NO circumstances discuss the best approach to the problem on the way there--absolutely no strategy or tactics--and if at all possible leave a clear and easy trail back here for as many walkers as possible to follow you.     Notice how there isn't really any deterent to keeping them away from the farm house. That wire fence won't do much...
B005W3G2D4|5.0|I am 64 yrs old, grew up on rock'n'roll, and spent 5 years working at Circuit City, and daily heard it all in my Audio/Video dept. I was always aware of this lady's talent, bought some singles along the way.This GIRL CAN SING!!!! Never really bought too many female artists albums, maybe some Blondie,Heart,Carly Simon, but I still love rock and a good voice with great lyrics. WOW, now that I have purchased STRONGER, guess I need to backtrack and get her previous CDs. I LOVE the songs when she tells the guy off and tells him off. I guess when girls in my younger years blew me off, I wish they would have sung it to me like Kelly...woulda made the breakup so much more entertaing!. Hats off to Kelly, her musicians and producers. Finally an album where I got MORE than my moneys worth
B005EY2XFC|5.0|this is one of the most original movies i ever saw about revenge. based on a comic, bringing this 2 movie form only did justice to its characters. in brandon lee's final performances, this is definetly a movie that will leave u wanting more. b4 the dark knight, there was the crow!!!
0439023521|5.0|I chose HG after an avid reader told me she couldn't put the trilogy down.  This book started very slow and continued to be slow and redundant, until the last 20ish pages.  But... having said that... I zipped through the entire trilogy in 3 days.  Once I was finished with HG, I could not stop until I had read the entire series.  And I'm glad I did.  Many other reviewers praise it more eloquently than I.  But what I wanted most to do, was encourage everyone to stick with it.  The themes are worth conversation.  To me, this is the anti-twilight in that the protagonist doesn't sit around pining for her true love.  She is a hard worker, hunting and providing for her family, and can kill when necessary.  I'm thrilled to have found a non-gender-specific book for tweens.
B004EPYZQM|5.0|this was absolutly the best best besst of the series!!!!!! there was so much action n this i wanted to cry. and the ending jst blew my mind open. jst wooww!!!!! cant wait 2 c how they gonna top that n fast 6.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|In my opinion, a far better book than the first in the series.  It's not often that you find that and is proof that sometimes it's worth it to continue reading a series that at first you think is \\"meh.\\"  I think I liked this one better because a) I read the print version (as opposed to the audio for the first book) and b) there was a lot less Sam and Grace gooey love stuff and c) Isabel figures prominently in this book.  By far, Isabel is the best character in the series thus far....she is witty, smart, and has her fair share of demons (no paranormal pun intended...these books are about werewolves, not demons, ha).<br /><br />These books are fast reads and I can understand their appeal to the Young Adult market.  Lots of angst and Grace's relationship with her parents is compelling, if disturbing.  Wouldn't be a bad idea for parents of teens to read, as well, if for no other reason than to understand that there are some battles parents cannot win.  ;)<br /><br />I'll certainly read the new third in the series and hope it's as compelling as this one.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|4 all those sons of anarchy fans out there who luv this show alredy, its a no brainer 2 pick this 1 up 4 ur collection. this season does something that the others didnt...it gets more darker and serious!!!! gr8 buy for fans and newbies alike.
B0014WSWTY|5.0|I bought this as a \\"pig in a poke\\" having no idea what to expect except for the sterling reviews. I must say I agree with all of the good things said about the recordings. Superb performances by an unknown (at least to me) ensemble and conductor. Sound quality is ravishing. I am an audiophile with SOTA equipment. The recordings were made using Sonodore and Avalon equipment, and that is enough for me to know that these people know and appreciate quality. And the performances provide a clarity of line unmatched by any other Beethoven cycle in my collection (and I have quite a few) BUY IT! You will not regret it!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie the second time as much as I enjoyed it when I watched it at the theatres. The best part is that it arrived to my address quicker than the expected delivery date. I think I will have this company on my top 5 list of companies to purchase from.
B000PMG16U|1.0|there are many reviews intermixed with the reviews of the 9 disc box set...this review is about the 3 blu-ray prequel trilogy with the Yoda face on the cover: THERE ARE NO EXTRA'S OR BONUS FEATURES ON THIS 3 BLU-RAY SET...i was terribly disappointed...no deleted scenes, no making of's, nothing...just a lousy commentary...(i hate people talking over my movie, this isn't Mystery Science Theater 3000 y'know)...movies are fine, but all the extra's are ONLY on the 9 disc box set (with boy Anakin on the cover on Tatooine)  Lucas has robbed me again.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|just because you're too stupid to understand how android permissions work doesn't mean you should penalize devs for your idiocy. like anybody gives a flying crap about your contacts or the content of your phone anyway! maybe instead of writing crap reviews of an app you never played you should spend time reading about what android permissions actually do.<br /><br />I like match three games, this one isn't bad. I still like treasures of Montezuma 2 better though so ill probably keep that and uninstall this.
B003MVJG8Q|1.0|Gave this 1 star because hardware appears to work OK.  Two things you need to know before purchasing one of these  1. It needs its own separate 4 pin power connector (not just PCI-E bus power)  2. DRIVERS WILL NOT WORK UNDER WINDOWS 7 x64   The drivers for this card (and I tried them all including the off-lable NEC drivers from the chip manufacturer and all versions from Transcend) will not work under windows 7 64 bit.   I knew I was taking a risk buying a card this cheap, next time I will know better (although I bought and currently use a single port USB 3.0 card froma different manufacturer purchased from Amazon for $5).
0670034711|5.0|Free from any preconceived notion of what to expect, I picked it up simply because the cover was appealing to me.  Little did I know that a book would read my soul to me and articulate so precisely thoughts and feelings I hadn't even expressed out-loud to myself.  Elizabeth Gilbert writes from her heart, free of any concern for judgements.  After leaving a marriage she struggled to leave for years, she is left in despair.  Adding to the complications a romance that won't last with a man she can't seem to get over.  She decides she needs to embark on a journey to three specific countries with specific purposes that will eventually lead to balance in this crazy life.  Italy for pleasure, India for discipline and getting her mind back in order, and finally Indonesia for the balance between the two.    Her feelings and her life are so genuine and honest, you can't help but be pulled into it and relate to it so desperately.  I became Liz, traveling through these countries, learning about myself, believing in the wise words of company.  The realizations and conclusions she comes to are spelled so clearly it's as if I learned them myself through my own experiences.    This book has it's own message to send and there's enough to value and appreciate in it thats worth your time.  If this book wasn't for someone else, thats fine, they're entitled to their own opinion.  But I'm writing this review because this book touched my life more than any other form of media could ever do, and if you're reading this review and thinking that it might be for you, READ IT.  This is your sign.    I am constantly referring back to this book to help me cope with everyday situations and I gather so much strength and healing in its words.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|If this doesn't get noticed and put Joe and Beth in the mainstream of popular music then I don't know what will. A bit of a departure for Joe Bonamassa as his playing is mellow in many places but he pours it on in the places where it works. Beth Hart, what can be said about her voice and style. Her singing is soulful, powerful and has a great range. Why she is not more well known in the U.S. I do not know. I hope that these two artists colaberate again. There is not a bad cut on the CD. If you like great soulful blues buy it!
B00164GDD2|5.0|Nothing I can say about this film that you already don't know.<br /><br />For me it is probably the greatest spoof on the ghost/poltergiest sub-genres ever made.<br /><br />Love Bill Murray as always, but Rick Moranis steals the show as the nerdy accountant/Key Master. The scene with him telling the horse he's the Key Master, & asking the horse if he's the Gate Keeper, then saying, \\"Wait for the sign, then our prisoners will be released!\\" Now that's funny!<br /><br />Twister anyone!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I thought this film was a fine outing by Marvel. Fans of the hero will feel happy to know that Marvel got his origin just right. Chris Evans is fantastic as the earnest, honest Steve Rogers. I felt that the villain in the film could have evinced more menace, but one cannot have everything. The tech in the film (shield, ships, etc) reflects some top-notch effects work.   As an aside, please disregard any reviews of this film that address whether or not the film has any nudity, or \\"language\\" that could be \\"harmful\\" to children. These concerns are irrelevant, and reflect backwards thinking. People need to STOP worrying about children accidentally seeing breasts or hearing an \\"f-bomb\\". The former is a natural body part, and the latter is a word that every human being uses from time to time.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|This is one of the greatest soundtracks I've bought in a long time. It the perfect soundtrack to just put on and just drive to. I would recommend this to anyone who loved the film.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|If you picked and chose through all of Coldplay's material you could create a cut and paste masterpiece, but from all different eras in the bands history. I can see why this can be a hard listen to some who followed ColdPlay from the start, but after going through the Pixies discography (never had heard one Pixies song and they hurt) and \\"I'm With You\\" by the Chili Peppers (the album title is a song by Avril Lavigne) over the past week, Mylo Xyloto sounds like heaven in comparison. It is also easy to listen to and not derivative.
B004EPZ06Q|2.0|The Hangover Part II is almost an exact copy of the first. Sure the second had one or two moments, but when you basically play Ad-Libs with the first script, you get this monster.
B003R69N20|1.0|I used it for couple of days and dust went inside the screen and thats it. Dust goes into the screen while you take the phone of your pocket......, very poorly designed.... total rip off!!!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Don't know about the others but works in HD, and on vizio tablet. Great take on match 3 game. No force close here.
B005DR64OQ|2.0|How many times have we seen this home invasion plot? Too many for it to be any different form any of the others. The only reason to watch it is if you are a fan of the actors. It's really, the same movie as all other hostage-in-their-own-home films you've seen since the damn of time. Regurgitated tripe that really doesn't merit a full review, so it's not gonna get one--
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Paul is a dope-smoking, foul mouthed, smart-ass alien who spent decades as a prisoner of the U.S. government while mistakenly believing that he was a guest.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be fond of somebody who swears, does drugs and takes decades to realize that they're being exploited, but Paul manages to be very charming.  He's a very likable kind of guy.  Just watch him on screen for five minutes and you'll see what I mean.  He's the kind of guy who makes friends easily.<br /><br />Of course it would probably be easier if he wasn't grey-skinned, four feet tall and had eyes the size of your fists.<br /><br />But even taking his physical appearance into consideration, Paul is TOTALLY lovable!  Paul is always willing to stick up for a friend and do whatever he can to help out.  He cares about the human beings on this planet more than most humans care!  And he's not even the same species as us!!<br /><br />The humor and the plot are a little difficult to describe.  It's sort of like what would happen if you mixed in a little bit of \\"E.T.\\", a little bit of \\"Close encounters of the Third Kind\\", a little bit of \\"Alien\\" and a little bit of one of those buddy/road-trip movies.<br /><br />It's difficult to explain, but basically if you love sci-fi and you enjoy a good comedy then you have every reason to buy this movie!
B003Q6D25K|2.0|Ok, I am convinced sequels can't outdo the originals.  This tried to tie the 2 movies together and did an ok job with the plot.  But how far can you go with a storyline of 'ghost whom you never see, terrorizes family'.  Take that and see what you come up with.  I think the Blair Witch Project was scarier.  Pretty lame things went on, it seemed rushed, and like it was grasping for something scarier than the original that it couldn't get a hold of.  Save your time and skip it cause it sucked.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|ur opinion that u leave here is supposed to reflect ur opinion of the app, not ur opinion of Amazon's choice to allow u to get the app at no charge. I'm not the dev,  but u idiots r unfairly rating thews apps. BTW, get it straight 1st that this isn't the Android Market, it's Amazon's Appstore n there r plenty of quality apps 4 all through either outlet. Just because u can act like an uneducated, disrespectful troll doesn't mean u should. Also, it's a paid app for free...it didn't cost u anything n nobody twisted ur scrawny arm to download or keep it so BE POLITE, at the very least. Hateful trolls...I gave it 3 stars because it's average...looking n playing, not imaginative enough for me to want to keep playing. This is only MY opinion, at least I'm rating this app on it's merits. THAT IS ALL!
B004EPYZPI|4.0|Matthew McConaughey stars as a successful defense attorney...the kind everyone hates.  He defends the scum who deserve to be in prison.  There are exceptions of course.  In this story he is hired to defend a spoiled rich realtor who is accused of a brutal attack on a prostitute.  Well played by Ryan Phillippe, it will take a while to figure him out.  Mickey (McConaughey) eventually does and the courtroom fun begins.  And I do like courtroom drama.  In spite of the twists and turns, the movie really doesn't break new ground.  Well except for the co-star, a 1988 (I think) Lincoln Towncar that Mickey uses as his office.  This is the most prominent use of a Lincoln since \\"Entourage\\".  Very entertaining and fun.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I already own the DVD with specials - have for a few years.  And I thought that looked amazing.  But to see this blu-ray transfer - oh, my....i don't remember it ever looking this good.  And it truly makes you feel like it's a new film. It's nearly unsettling how you feel like you are actually flying over the lakes and trees in the opening.  Excellent job - and made it worth going out and buying the same flick again....remarkable job - bravo!
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Spoiler Alert:  It's been many years since I saw what is considered to be one of Michelangelo Antonioni's masterpieces, for the first time.  It is also his most successful film and the only one made in English (maybe his first).  In any case, I have a new appreciation for the film and at the same time reject the \\"masterpiece\\" tag.  I will admit, my memories were focused on the constant parading of boney British models in various stages of undress.<br /><br />David Hemmings is a successful fashion photographer who is fed up ,or at least bored, with his career.  We see throughout the film, sex, drugs, wealth and all the trappings of the \\"Mod\\" era of London in the 60's.  Thomas (Hemmings) goes on a search for items he thinks he needs for his next shoot.  While shooting in a park, he photographs a couple engaging in playful romance.<br /><br />The woman (a young Venessa Redgrave) tracks him down and insists she needs the pictures that he had taken.  When Thomas develops the film he believes he has witnessed a murder and does what he can to prove it...except of course, call the police.  This is a clue to why this may all be a fantasy.  There are others.  When Thomas asks one of his models why she isn't in Paris as he thought, she says \\"I am\\".  When he says to the girl in the park, \\"we only just met\\", she replies \\"no we haven't\\".<br /><br />The concluding sequence involves a mime troupe - also featured at the beginning of the film - watching 2 of them play tennis, without balls or racquets.  After Thomas tosses an errant phantom ball back over the fence and walks away, we hear actual balls bouncing for the first time.  Alas, perhaps it's all in his mind, and a hoax on us.  Now I love twisty-turny plots.  The problem for me with this film is that it isn't particularly entertaining.  Much time is given just setting up the atmosphere.  At times the movie is as boring as Thomas' life.<br /><br />Here are a few bits of trivia however that makes the movie re-watchable.  Thomas' primary camera is a Nikon F; a precursor of the FE which I bought in the early 70's and still have.  During a club scene, we see a band belting out \\"Train Kept a Rollin'\\" (here called \\"Stroll On\\").  It's the Yardbirds during the brief period when Jeff Beck (busting up a guitar, ala Pete Townshend) and Jimmie Page were both in the band.  This is the first British film where full frontal female nudity is shown.  Herbert (aka Herbie) Hancock did the musical score.  Oh hell, now I have to watch it again.<br /><br />Note: When playing the DVD, a stereo soundtrack plays over the opening credits, but then the sound mutes.  I had to stop the DVD and select Dolby Digital Mono to continue the sound. The same thing happened on other players.  I don't know if this was just a fluke with this disc, but I've never had this happen before or since with any other DVD or Blu ray.primary camera is a Nikon F; a precursor of the FE which I bought in the early 70's and still have.

1597801585|5.0|This book is utterly extraordinary.  The incredible, dystopian world is vividly depicted in tight, compelling prose.  I could not stop reading it.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|While somewhat primitive based on what we see today, the special effects and sets created for this sci-fi classic raised the bar for the genre.  For a more accurate comparison, look at some of the other films of the day.  Before Leslie Nielsen became the go-to guy for comedic parodies, he was a serious actor and yes, this is a serious film. Ann Francis plays his romantic interest and wears short \\"futuristic\\" outfits that, as Steven Spielberg says, \\"makes you wish she were your babysitter\\" when watching this movie as a kid. Both Nielsen and Francis died recently.<br /><br />The story involves a team of space travelers from Earth in the 23rd century who are on a mission to find a research party that has not been heard from.  Upon arrival at the planet Altair-4, they are met by the lone survivors, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon adding credibility to the role) and his winsome daughter, Alta (Francis).  The rest of the party has been killed by an alien creature decades earlier.  Morbius has discovered a new race that ruled for thousands of centuries only to disappear overnight.  The seemingly undefeatable creature comes back again, and the Shakespearian plot thickens.<br /><br />Sure, the film has its share of cheese but it is easily offset by a more serious look at our inner selves.  Perhaps more important is that \\"Forbidden Planet\\" took a serious look at science fiction in film and set the stage for Star Trek, Star Wars and others to follow.<br /><br />As an aside, the Blu ray package includes a terrific TCM documentary \\"Watch the Skies!\\" about sci-fi films of the 50's featuring interviews with the aforementioned Spielberg, George Lucas, James Cameron and Ridley Scott.  These guys know their film history and really get excited about these science fiction classics.
B001K3ENEA|5.0|I bought a pair of these for my computer. I plan on using them for editing movies and I have to say that the sound quality is impressive for this price.   I run them on a headphone amp connected to my external FW-soundcard and they sound great!  I'm not sure if they're good looking or so ugly that they start to look good. I've always liked Harman's sound, so I guess this would be well worth the money as well.
B0036T31YY|4.0|Good movie, was worried it would be a dud at first. It's interesting like Memento. I was rooting for her!
B004LWZW24|5.0|All horror and suspense films owe tribute to Hitchcock. This one counts as well. But this film rates a 10 out of 10 for me. Very creative, well-done, and no nonsense. From the word go, the film has a dark atmosphere which pays off well in the last twist of the film.  Please watch this...and say goodbye to sleep and your psyche.
0446585025|5.0|I love Ellen. I love her show, and this book gives you a little bit more when her show is not on. I love her positive outlook on everything, and her humerous open mind to every situation. I highly recommend this book!
B00005N6KG|4.0|haven't used it yet, will have to wait and see! But the package seems clean and nice and arrived in time.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have a new found respect for James Cameron.<br /><br />Sure, this is an environmental allegory, without the pretense of fiction. It's blatant and in-your-face. Despite the corny name for the film's McGuffin (the heavy natural magnetic ore called unobtanium) and obvious parallels to the real-world problems faced by older cultures (native Americans, Brazilian tribes et al) we are treated to a new world that faces the same problems as anyone else. That, and the crazy-cool computer graphics for everything from the beasts and natives of the world of Pandora to frikkin' mech suits. We are revisited by Sigourney Weaver and once again she brings on a powerful persona into the film. But the real magic is in Sam Worthington portraying disabled military veteran who refuses to quit. The characters are all obvious stereotypes, but we love them anyway. The range of emotion for the entire film is incredible despite the similarities with other films such as Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai.<br /><br />This gem of a BR release contains three versions of the film, theatrical, special edition re-release, and the collector's extended cut. There is a large portion of folk who were unhappy with the re-release, but a vehemently voice of praise for the extended edition. Plus, these films are made to be 'family friendly', and so the theatrical and special editions both have a language filter. And that's just what's on the first disc. The other two are swamped with all manner of behind the scenes, extensive interviews, nearly an hour of deleted scenes, and tons more. I imagine most folk will buy this set for the three versions of the film, but film geeks like me get to enjoy all the tid-bits that every BD should come with.<br /><br />And apparently, this film is the first in a trilogy. If you ask me, they have a very high benchmark they need to obliterate. The ending of Avatar is, in my eyes, nigh-perfection.<br /><br />All in all, this is without a doubt one of the greatest BD releases to this day. A close second being Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It is hard to catch the lightning in a bottle, and very few films seem able to do just that. Avatar not only catches the lightning, but it throws it back in your face, making you question the material driven nature of mankind and the natural simplicity we seem to have left behind many years ago.<br /><br />Here's to the newest epic, on par with Star Trek, better than Star Wars, and more grandeur than the Lord of the Rings. This BD is incredible, and it's only sin is an apparently left behind Gag Reel. But it may very well be within the Live features.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun with a film since the Abyss.ases to this day. A close second being Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't mind any of the changes made in the film, I really like that at the end of ROTJ you see a younger Annakin.  Would recommend for any fan, if you freak out about change maybe you should move on.  just enjoy the fun
B005JLNALG|5.0|Road Salt Two by Pain of Salvation is an inspired collection of extremely well written songs that are raw, soulful, authentic, atmospheric, innovative, passionate, transcendental, visceral.  I have read complaints from some fans or prior fans who say that this album is nothing more than a 70's throwback, but that is is a grossly oversimplified, over-generalized statement.  I grew up listening to 70's progressive rock, and there was no band that sounded like Pain of Salvation in the 70's.  While there are undeniably some influences from the 70's on this recording, the genius of Gildenlow and PoS is that they have synthesized those influences (along with many other influences: middle eastern music, gospel, blues, jazz, folk, 90's subpop, etc.) into their own scintillating, completely original blend; true artistry!    The raw emotive power of Gildenlow's voice stands out on this recording, indeed, on RS1 and RS2 both, his voice is at it's authentic, emotive, passionately unbridled best!  The musicianship on this recording is impeccable as always and there are so many powerful pieces on this release: Eleven, Conditioned, Softly She Cries, Healing Now, 1979, and the stunning Physics of Gridlock, that I can't pick a favorite!    I continue to admire this band for their artistic authenticity and willingness to share their deepest emotional experiences so adeptly through their music.  Few that I have heard over decades of listening to music are willing or capable of creating this caliber of audible art!  Listen with an open mind and an open heart; you won't be disappointed!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome job on the series and the quality is top notch. The extras on it are totally worth it. A few new changes that I didn't care for but it didn't ruin it for me. What's up with the new Ben kenobi scream when he's chasing away the sand people on ep iv
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was an awesome read! I loved the way all the stories meshed together! I don't review books much, but I was compelled to write a review of this book as soon as I finished reading it.   The stories are short and focused and damn creepy, and the overall message is very humanistic. It made me really wonder about how humanity, globally, would actually act if a zombie war actually happened, while most movies and books on the subject never really scratch the surface.  Read it now!
B001AW156U|4.0|Really comfortable to use. i use it when playing racing games, fingers wont slip away and cost you the photo finish.
B004R739LE|4.0|I currently use a much smaller \\"sling\\" style bag, which is the Vanguard Pampas 47. It is a great bag for when you are on the move, out for maybe 1-3 hours at a time, OK with a limit amount of lenses, and want to get the camera out quickly (hence the sling option). With kids along though it isn't always up to the task of holding all the toys, treats, drinks, clothing, etc......Also if you want some extra lenses, flashes, etc.... it runs out of room quickly.  The Orion daypack is light weight and seems to be of decent build quality but isn't overbuilt. Designed more for the urban adventure then roughing it out in the elements. It is about twice the size of my Vanguard bag and has two traditional over the shoulder straps, vs. the single sling of the smaller bag. The straps and back are padded for comfort. Like the Vanguard bag, the bottom is where you would store your camera body, lenses, and flashes. (feels like 1/2\\" foam for the protection on all sides) It doesn't open on the side so you cannot cheat like with the sling bag by only partially removing the bag to get your camera out. You will need to take it off, unzip it and get your items out. The area for camera and lenses has some velcro dividers which you can move around to fit your needs. If you looking to get one of the big Canon zooms in there, you won't be getting your body in the lower part though. It is designed for smaller to midsized lenses.   The upper part has similar spacing as the lower, just no dividers and one small internal mesh \\"pocket\\". Perfect for a light jacket, food, etc.... It has zippered side pockets for small items like a phone you might want to have quick access to( up top) and mesh pockets (on the bottom sides). It also has a two cinch straps underneath you could put a small tripod in with or secure a jacket. It has extensions that go over the zipper welds (for moisture protection) but I don't think I will be trusting them enough based on their look and feel to be comfortable having thisout in inclement weather.  Weight is listed at 1.3 pounds.   Inner Dimensions of camera compartment: 11W x 6D x 6.9H  Inner Dimensions of upper compartment:  12W x 5D x 9H  Overall nice dedicated camera lower pack with more traditional upper storage. Will be replacing my vanguard bag on more extended outings, or short outgoing where I need to haul more stuff or need more flash, battery, and lens choices. Great for my needs and I would recommend.
B004FEJ3VY|1.0|My 5 year old who is a bright kid was given this.  The instructions are ok at very best, not good and poor for a first timer buyer.  If you have these and are used to the basic functions of these types of toys then you may be fine but if this is your first transformer toy for a 5 year old it is better to start them with an easy one. This is a mid-level one and will challange most parents.  The idea is the kids should be able to do it and a 5 year old won't learn on this toy.
1451648537|5.0|I treated myself to the Kindle download right after midnight last night and began reading--it's very well written and a great absorbing book!  I've been aware of SJ and his legendary temper and eccentricities for many years including a few insights from those around his circle of acquaintances.  I'm glad SJ allowed the unvarnished truth told and saw how his life story could be instructive and cautionary to many.  When you're about to die, your viewpoint changes as you realize the truth, or what will pass as it, is or will be out there anyway soon.  So it is much better for it to be written up well and include some of your inner experiences and rationale for posterity and legacy.       I switched to Mac back in 1990 and never looked back, so I'm a long-time Apple user and have followed all things Apple for many years in this valley.  I'm expecting his life's work to inspire, and this book will keep it real for those growing up now to learn he was after all a real human being like the rest of us...flaws and all.  He just learned how not to give up (which is a powerful capability in and of itself) which I think is what gave him the extra years he fought so hard to live for through the devastating illness that finally took him home to God.  I HIGHLY recommend this book from which to learn so much about life in this valley as it once was and as it grew into Silicon Valley.  I'm a native to this area, and old enough to wistfully remember all the orchards in this valley before Silicon.  Enjoy the ride!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Best book he has written yet! Can`t wait for the next one. I hope its just as good as this one {or better!}
1451648537|4.0|Steve Jobs - 100 million people, one could guess, probably changed their Facebook profile pictures the day he died. Every major tastemaker in design and media gave a statement on his passing. Bono played his private funeral.  Isaacson certainly gets a lot of detail and data across about the private perfectionist; yet, there's literally not enough synthesis or understanding (I'll say it, \\"thinking\\") into what made Jobs \\"Jobs\\". I just came off the book, Talent is Overrated, and think that Jobs was instinctual and demanding to get his products right. One can almost feel Jobs \\"ghost-editing\\" this tome to make it perfect - yet great bios are best on imperfect personalities, I think.  Maybe this is the case when books get rushed to print following famous passings, or may be an unauthorized version would have been more authentic. I think we'll see more of these, but definitely worth a first read.
B000001GAM|3.0|The reviews for this recording are more passionately positive than for any other I've seen, but they are not supported by the recording itself. The playing and the recording are of high quality, but the conducting misses the mark.  The Bruckner 9th should build gradually as the lofty edifice comes into full being; I regard Bruckner as a kind of impressionist in that the evolution in time of the music, at least in any given movement, does not proceed from place to place but rather tends to hover and fill in the impression associated with that movement. The most suitable conducting style recognizes this by modulating tempo and dynamics.  In this recording, Giulini doesn't really modulate at all in either dimension. He merely goes slowly (longer timings than any other recording I checked), and rather vaguely, through the score. Loud parts are pretty loud, but not emphatic. Soft parts are not very soft, and do not get the momentary slowing of tempo that would better distinguish them from the loud parts and let the listener hear some of the ethereal magic of those parts. Bridging parts wander. Overall, this recording does impress from time to time (mostly because of the excellent playing of the VPO) but does not inspire.  There are many worthy recordings of the Bruckner 9th. Solti really got Bruckner, and the recording of the 9th in the currently-available complete-symphonies set ([[ASIN:B0000042ED Symphonies (Complete  Comp)]]) mesmerizes, inspires, and enraptures in a way that would match the rhetoric of the other reviewers for the Giulini recording. I continue to enjoy the '60s recording by the then-young-and-promising Zubin Mehta and the VPO, available on (currently very expensive) CD ([[ASIN:B00005N56Z Bruckner: Symphony No.9]]) and LP ([[ASIN:B004XGCGJA LXT 6202 Bruckner Symphony 9 VPO Zubin Mehta LP]]).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Must face it, I'm a big fan of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Her will to see the lives of her family, \\"cousins\\" and friends protected and her own human survival skills are pretty impressive in this first book.   I really wonder how they'll make the Capitol look in the upcoming movie too.  I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of great YA (young adult) literature. The brevity of the writing, succinct storylines and generally interesting characters make them worthwhile ... and don't seem to just retread the usual writing we see with fiction. Maybe it's the younger, more unpredictable Millennial leads?
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Great music and arrangement of songs   I like the music has a great range of blues and some soul easy to listen too and not to boring keps you going and want to listen to the next song.  The singer reminds me a bit of Etta James but doing a great job.  In overall I like the CD and it is great music and song arrangements.
0439023491|3.0|Really came back to Katniss expecting a strong second act in the series - her love with Peeta (or Gale as it were - sorry for the spoilers), her living large as a Victor and the spread of uprisings and the curious District 13...<br /><br />However, the writing and the structure just seemed off. Even with Romulus Thread, the new Peacekeeper (who pretty much lacks personality), there's not enough new \\"hunger\\" in this second book to convince me to buy the third.
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|More than just another solid installment to this season. I think this week was one of the top three episodes to date.   This episode is a brave triumph, setting gratuitous gore aside and leaning on the strengths of the actors. Walking Dead is maturing at a welcomed pace. If I'm not mistaken, there were no shots fired in this episode. Congrats!   Could they please find this girl before it's too late? I can't stand it!
0446585025|1.0|Never before have I read a book that said nothing! What a waste of time and money! This should NEVER have been published.

What crap! By the way, I had to pick at least one star but, in reality, I choose a negative 1,000,000 stars!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I have always bought the latest and greatest with Disney, so buying this Blu-Ray combo pack was no different.  Love the graphics on the Blu-Ray.  Plays great, and has a lot of great extras.  We don't have a 3D TV yet, so I can't comment on it from that perspective, but I am totally satisfied with the rest of the discs and will be enjoying this movie for many years to come!!
0785153322|5.0|The Marvel Cinematic Universe is great! It is the way these Marvel comic movies should have been made all along. I wish so bad that Marvel would get the film rights back for X-Men, Spiderman and Fantastic Four and reboot them. Fox has done ok with some of these films but they are very inconsistent and often times horribly miscast or horrible written...with a few exceptions.   The reason Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America work so well is the great casting (Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Edward Norton Bruce Banner....on and on), Awesome Sci-Fi Effects and top quality graphics, great stories, adapt comics to film well, and the great sense of humor.  These films aren't like the Christopher Nolan Batman series. You can't take that angle with these films. They are a different kind of story, to grand to be brought down to our level, so why not embrace the sci-fi element and make them more fantastical. That's why I think these films are so successful. What these books display is how great the art and design are, which is one of the things I love most about these films. This set is a must have! It collects all these great books in hardcover editions in one beautiful set. This is the best way to get all these books in one shot for a great price...this will no doubt be a collectors set that will be highly valued when out of print...so get two!  I collect \\"art of\\" books for films and this set is at the top of my collection for quality. Great concept art, writing, all the behind the scenes stuff artists like to look at...Don't miss out on this set!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|this is game is very good and very fun. But if the app was updated to have a HD package that can be downloaded on the side, then sure I would give this app 5 stars. installed on a HTC Inspire 4G (HD Desire)
0739368435|5.0|When I was searching for an audiobook, this one popped up & I thought it would be an interesting topic.  I ended up loving it.  The style it was written in was really fun & I learned a lot about a part of history I had never known about.  It made we want to get on a plane & go visit the Island of Guernsey right away! I loved the characters & the way the story developed.  Such a great read!

B003ITZBVI|5.0|This entry in the Batman lore may be the best one by Warner Bros. of all time.  The story is tight, the action is intense, and the characters are well played.  Why cant they make a live action movie like this?  Great movie overall.

B00284BMBM|2.0|There is no possible way Daughtry is going to \\"Leave This Town\\" with the wheels having fallen off.<br /><br />Tracks 1 - 4 are exceptional, and then...then...it all falls apart like a sand castle at high tide. Don't get me wrong, I like rock ballads just like the next guy from time to time, and \\"September\\" is a marginal to above-average effort, but EVERYTHING else after track 4 just outright sucks. There are no memorable choruses, no heartfelt lyrics, no good hooks, no high level guitar solos, no nothing...just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!<br /><br />While the first album was over-produced and tended to sound the same after six or seven songs, it was still tolerable and listenable. \\"Leave This Town\\" was simply head-shaking to me. And those head shakes were in disbelief at how terrible these songs really are. They all sound like cookie-cutter copies of each other, and they are extremely painful to listen to. The country song is just simply ridiculous.<br /><br />If the next album doesn't produce a consistent list of good music, like songs 1 - 4 on this album, then my listening-to-Daughtry-days are over and done. I won't waste my time with a fourth album.<br /><br />Two Stars for 1 - 4, and a teeny-tiny bit of star for \\"September.\\"

1400052181|5.0|I've found this book to be interesting and inspiring. I know the use of human tissue without patient permission is still a hot issue. I found it unfortunate that even now the relatives of Henrietta Lacks STILL aren't even given health care. That small act would seem the least that could be done considering the many lives the cells from this woman are STILL saving!
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs wanted to change the world, \\"put a dent in the universe.\\" And he did.  If you are interested in life and want to know how Jobs changed it right before our eyes, you should read this book.   No other book on Jobs has been based on first hand information from the Master himself, his colleagues and his detractors. There is no other way to know the man who changed the way we live and work. The fact that the book is engaging is a big bonus.   First Jobs' personal life, personality and beliefs. Like all fascinating people in history, Jobs was a bundle of contradictions. Born out of wedlock, he was an American icon and yet born of a Syrian Muslim whom he never knew, but had accidentally met. Adopted at birth by working class parents, he became skeptical of the Church as the all-knowing god did not help the starving children in Biafra and alternated between being a believer and a non-believer. He was, at different times, a vegan and a fruitarian (hence the name Apple).  Jobs was influenced by the counter cultural ideas of the 60's and the 70's and yet become one of the most revered corporate figures of all time. He was a multi-billionaire who lived on a regular street with no high fenced compound, security or live-in servants; a Zen Buddhist who was obsessed with Zen-like simplicity but did not possess Zen-like tranquility; a son who tried to abandon his child like the way he had thought he was abandoned; a leader who was highly demanding of his colleagues and coworkers; a vastly influential figure in computing who neither built computers not wrote codes himself; a genius who was mean to many people. All these factoids had to have some influence on who he was and who he became and may keep interested psychologists busy for years. Yet, it is not for these tabloid fodder that he is looked upon with awe. To get caught up in the contradictions of a man is to miss the man.   So who is the man then? Isaacson presents Jobs life and work as a play in three acts.    During the first act, two unlikely partners named Steves (Jobs and Woz) create the world's first commercially viable personal computer, Apple II. Jobs then creates the revolutionary but unsuccessful Lisa. Apple goes public, Jobs creates the Mac, which carves itself a distinct niche. He then brings in Pepsi's Scully to manage the company only to find himself ousted from the company he founded. During his exile Jobs creates another revolutionary but not-so-successful computer NeXT.  But Jobs other venture, Pixar, an outstanding animation company, is a huge commercial success.  The second act is Jobs' return to Apple.  Apple was in decline and it buys the money losing NeXT. Job returns to the company he founded as the interim CEO. Introduces a series of products: peppermint colored iMacs followed b y 21st Century Macs.  The third act is the post-pc revolution, the most dramatic of all: the creation of ipod (almost 10 years ago to the day), paradigm-changing iphone and the category-creating ipad, along with many other things and cloud computing. We can't imagine a world today without ipads, ipods and iphones. The rewards are high. Apple first surpasses Microsoft and becomes the most valuable tech company. Then Apple becomes, for brief periods of time, the most valuable company in the world.  But this is not the story of Apple, but of Job. What was happening in the background while the three act play is being staged -  to his family, his health, his odd beliefs that might have cost him his life, and his relationships with other giants of technology - is the focus of this book. The story is told with many interesting anecdotes such as Bill Gates incredulously exclaiming \\"Do ALL of you live here?\\" when visiting for the first time Steve Jobs' modest house.  This is an \\"authorized  biography\\" and I'm wary of \\"authorized\\" biographies. Always thought they were full-length PR pieces. This one is different. Jobs gave Isaacson complete freedom to write the book and Jobs didn't demandeditorial control. He didn't even want to see the book before it was published. And it shows. You see Jobs as he was. Warts and all. This is Jobs' last gift to those of us who admired his vision of the world, but wondered about the essence of the man behind it all. Now we know.  As you finish reading Job's biography of nearly 600 pages, something strikes you as odd. Steve Jobs' death is not mentioned in the book. Not the date, not the time and not even the fact that he is no more. Strangely fascinating. Like the man himself.
B004ZN9RWK|1.0|I have the original vinyl LP; I went to the original Dark Side of the Moon concert tour.  I am a huge fan.  This edition is awful.  There are big gaps between songs - actually songs are cut off and unfinished - jumping from one song to the next with jarring premature stops.  I bought it through downloading, so there is no way to return it or I would.  I am very disappointed.  Now I'm going to have to borrow my 82 year old mother's copy and burn that one for myself.  She has had hers for about 15 years, and it flows from one song to the next like it is supposed to.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|If you're sick of hearing \\"the 1st Tom Waits album in 7 years\\", guess Bad As Me arrives right on schedule. That is if you don't count him emptying out the Orphanage a few years back. Maybe he breaks a mirror after every album & is just waiting for the bad luck to wear off.<br /><br />The album kicks off on the road with a manic Mr. Toad's wild ride to \\"Chicago\\". An open invitation to wrong side of the road, careening its way to the Big City, where all your dreams turn blue. Throughout this road trip Waits seems to throw the pages of any itinerary to the wind. His only destination seems to be to \\"Get Lost\\". From Bluesy barnstormers(\\"Raised Right Men\\") to after hours ballads (\\"Kiss Me\\"), fans from every phase of Waits' traveling sideshow will find something to take home here.<br /><br />\\"Hell Broke Luce\\" finds Waits in one helluva bad mood, putting you right in the middle of the war-zone in a song that would have been at home on 2004's Real Gone. But where Real Gone gave the piano a rest, Waits blows the dust off the ivories. For every hell raiser like \\"Luce\\", \\"Kiss Me\\" is a nod in the mirror back to the barfly balladeer of his Blue Valentine days. It's enough to make you stop and do a double take in slow motion.<br /><br />For all the criticism of his signature rusty pipes, the laid back falsetto croon he puts into \\"Talking at the Same Time\\" shows far more range than most fans and critics are willing to admit. \\"Pay Me\\" is Waits at his most tongue in cheek while  \\"Back In Crowd\\" is the sound of a heart quietly breaking at sunset, complete with a Mariachi band playing in the shadows.<br /><br />Throughout, Bad As Me also makes crystal clear just how integral guitarist Mark Ribot has been to Waits' sound since 1985's Rain Dogs. Some of his most subtle work can be heard on the eerie \\"Face to the Highway\\" while some of his most raucous is featured on the title track.<br /><br />Another guitarist that pops up here is a little known hack named, Keith Richards (nah, never heard of him either). Leave it to Keef to put an an alley cat strut into Satisfaction, a grumpy old man's answer to the Stones classic. At first glance, its a bit of a toss off, on second, a middle finger to mortality. Even more poignant is Keef's ghostly duet on the bittersweet, \\"Last Leaf\\".<br /><br />While welcome, am glad the bonus tracks are on a separate disc since they would lessen the impact of the overall album. But who doesn't want to hear what happens \\"After You Die?\\" That said, there's a real gem in \\"Tell Me\\". Not to knock \\"New Year's Eve\\", but perhaps it would have made for a more powerful ending.<br /><br />If Waits' last few proved a bit unwieldy for some, Bad As Me is Waits' most concise and accessible in years. As for this longtime eavesdropper, I can't stop placing my glass to the wall. The audio equivalent of a mighty fine scotch...At the end of a horrible deed...<br /><br />Hit me again, Tom...ard of him either).

0316098337|4.0|This story begins a bit slow (it's told from a 5-year-old's point of view)...but, once you get into it, it's difficult to put down!  Just imagine what this world must look like if you've never been beyond an 11' x 11' room.  Never met anyone else, except your mother, nor knew what it's like to experience the outdoors.  It's definitely eye-opening.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|On its surface, the Captain America character is pretty ridiculous. The name alone is rife with World War II jingoism that seems out of place in today's considerably more cynical and global world.  Director Joe Johnston smartly embraced the silliness that is a superhero with a giant \\"A\\" on his forehead through a mix of digital wizardry, American montages, and good old fashioned Nazi-punching.<br /><br />Steve Rogers (who first appears as a digitally-altered version of Chris Evans) is an asthmatic wimp with a hero's heart.  He can't fight for beans and he's been rejected from the Army four times, but that doesn't stop him.  Rogers may not be popular with the ladies but he's a moral man, a theme that will carry throughout the film. It's his bright soul that attracts former German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to Rogers for a top-secret super-soldier project.<br /><br />That project, initiated by Erskine under the funding of insane Nazi Johann Schmidt (played with feral menace by Hugo Weaving), is a super-soldier serum.  It has one side-effect however - whoever is injected with the glowing blue stuff gains super strength and endurance but also reveals his true self. Schmidt's face peels off, thus his moniker The Red Skull.  Once Rogers becomes the hero he always knew he could be, Captain America: The First Avenger really gets rolling.<br /><br />Until then, the scrawny, CGI-diminished form of Rogers is distracting.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but Evans just doesn't look right. Evans' booming voice betrays the deeply powerful body that it belongs to. But once Rogers is in Evan's true form, he is a wonder to behold.  The film literally hits the ground running once Rogers becomes Captain America.<br /><br />Lurking around the edges of Captain America is the idea of the ubermensch or superman.  It's interesting that the film completely avoids this topic; Erskine's genetic research was a real focus for both the German and U.S. governments.  Good old Cap is the Nazi ideal realized, but the script never goes there.<br /><br />The Nazi obsession with the reclamation of a Slavic identity is also missing.  In part, this was the motivation behind the Ahhenerbe quest for ancient artifacts proving German supremacy - the same quests that were made legendary in the Indiana Jones series.  There is mention of Yggdrasil, the Nordic tree of life, and the Tesseract, which fortunately is never actually named in the film. This cube, a boundless source of energy, funds all sorts of Schmidt's projects and it's not long before he turns against his Nazi overseers to launch his own splinter organization, HYDRA.<br /><br />Captain America is basically a guy juiced up on super steroids that runs around with a bull's-eye shield, and the film cleverly capitalizes on the larger-than-life comic book without disrespecting the pulp feel of an ugly war.  Rogers transforms from super-soldier to poster boy for America, and his ridiculous outfit comes complete with dancing girls.  This plays well in the States until Rogers is sent to the front lines to cheer up the troops, where he's jeered as a \\"chorus girl.\\"<br /><br />The film never lets us forget this: superheroes are ridiculous enough in civilian life, but in war they're a dangerous liability.  Rogers has to prove himself every day to crusty Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones, with some of the funniest lines in the film) and the beautiful-but-tough British Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter).  Atwell's burgeoning romance with Evans centers the film; they're less star-crossed lovers than two kids just trying to go out on a first date in a war-torn world.<br /><br />Captain America, being a war film, has heaping measures of American optimism and personal loss.  The optimism is embodied by the Howard Hughes-like Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper, playing Tony Stark's father), who is the host of the World's Fair and inventor of Rogers' outfit.  When Rogers' best friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)is captured by HYDRA, it's propels Captain America to risk everything to rescue him. During that rescue mission Rogers gets a glimpse of a map with the locations of HYDRA's bases, leading to the final conflict as Captain America and his soldier buddies take down the wicked organization, one technologically-advanced Nazi at a time.<br /><br />It's hard not to love Captain America.  Ever respectful of its roots, it harks back to a time when America believed in the promise that anyone could be a hero at a time when the world desperately needed heroes.  Although it glosses over some rough edges, this is a film made by someone who clearly loved war films.  You can see the fingerprints of its pulp ancestors on everything from the lensing to the musical score to the brilliantly executed credits.  Captain America may be something of an anachronism in today's world, but this film does his reputation justice as a war hero.cue him.

B003LPV960|5.0|It's nice to find a movie that my entire family can watch.  A couple of scenes are a little \\"bawdy\\" but there is no gratuitous use of foul language to spoil it.<br />The product I purchased has both Blu-ray and DVD, as well as electronic copy for download.  The vibrant colors of this movie work exceptionally well on the Blu-ray, and the differences are quite noticable (and favorable) when compared to the DVD.

1400052181|5.0|My teacher recommended that book to us in order to be discussed in class. It's one of the best I've ever read.
B000GH2YPG|1.0|Many negative reviews have already been written about this book.  I chose to ignore them and read the book anyways.  Hmm...<br /><br />My verdict (which was swift from the beginning but kept getting delayed because I want to give the book full justice) is that I wished I never picked up this book.  The author did an excellent job of keeping up the sense of foreboding dread.  If you like that kind of a book, then it would be good for you.  If there is enough tension, heartache, and doom in your life, don't pick up this book.  The author doesn't give us any relief.<br /><br />I am a reader of classics and have foresworn against Harlequin novels since I was in high school.  This author does an excellent job of describing Manderly (the mansion and its property) and of leading the reader to spin in the mind of the nameless narrator (2nd wife of Mr. Maxim DeWinter).  Otherwise there is no plot, and nearly no movement.  Just plenty of character description without any character development.  Even the first person narrator didn't really undergo character development.<br /><br />I understand that many people will still choose to read this book based on the 5 star reviews.  Believe me, there are way better classics to read than this.

1903517958|4.0|This is a unique collection of Estonian literature, translated into English.  This is the only book of it's kind that I've found, so it's kind of hard to really rate it.  The selection is interesting - contains writings from the small number of Estonian authors I'm familiar with plus many I haven't heard of.  The translations are good quality and read well.  I especially appreciate the brief biographies of the authors at the back of the book, this helps to put the stories into some kind of context.  The assortment of stories is varied and interesting.  All in all, a book that I find a lot of value in.  I can't really speak to how it would appeal to someone for casual reading - for me it has meaning because of my Estonian heritage and rudimentary Estonian language skills.  I also see this as having interest to fans of the short story, in particular, world literature.

B005G4TJUC|3.0|Maybe I'm just not a Transformers person, but I found this one to be long, drawn out, and boring. The plot was rather ridiculous (as per usual) and I'm was extremely saddened by the absence of Megan Fox. I guess if you've seen the other two, you might as well see this one, but to me it wasn't all that enjoyable.

B004WJV6OY|4.0|If you like Eddie's solo stuff from both Into the Wild and Ukelele Songs, you'll love this performance.  It also gives Eddie a chance to show off his sense of humor and overall personality.  It feels like he's hanging out with the crowd rather than \\"putting on a show\\".  Just know that it is a totally acoustic and mellow  performance.  There are no full band, loud/fast songs.
B002KR7NTC|5.0|This movie is hilarious.  No wonder it's been a classic that's been watched for many years!  Be aware that there are no subtitles so whoever watches this must be able to understand French, English and probably some German too.  I cannot understand German but can the other two languages.  Other than that, I couldn't stop laughing throughout this movie.  I highly recommend it.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Acting not too bad.  Story, believable.  Dancing, are you KIDDING me?  Ballet with the world's BEST and the late Gregory Hines...WOW!  Definitely a classic and timeless movie.

The design allows me to utilize a screen protector and and still see the great sleek design of the phone. Great price too

This family should have been informed as to what was going on and benefited also from the outcome as her cells are still doing research that benefit others.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Though it is only a make believe moive, the music if awsome.  I like the screen play very much.  It is a reflection of the tragic caused by our previous generation and the hope for children in the Froster Home.  Not all children given away turn out with such luck to find both of the parents who are still in love with each other after such seperation.  I love the way music is interperated.  Like the foreign film \\"Beyond Silence\\", this is my favorite children film.  Nowaday, children are so spoiled that they have no idea how their lives could possibly without their loving parents.  Many adults grow up also with the hurting child inside from the divorced or death of their parents.  This movie is very healing.  I am saving it for my mother, my boyfriend to watch.  This is also one of the few musical DVD in my collection.  I bought the soundtrack after watcing the DVD, but the music is too loud to be enjoyed.  Please buy DVD only and don't waist your money on CD.
B004CGUC06|5.0|Amarcord is an oddball film. It does not have a specific plot or story and there is not a main character with a purpose. Instead, we are introduced to an array of unique individuals each one with its own plots and conflicts. Amarcord follows the life of this town and the characters that populates it. Although there is no story \\"per se\\", the movie is very engaging and you'll never feel bored. One of the film merits is that fills the screen with unforgettable characters such as Gradisca, Titta, his parents, the priest, the narrator and more. Also the score by Nino Rota is amazing and enhances the whole experience.<br /><br />Unlike other films by Fellini, Amarcord is pure fun without much subcontext or political themes, the characters just live there, watch each other, tease each other, fight, laugh, etc. Many have said that this film is a biographical one but although it does contain elements that undoubtedly belong to Fellini's life, this film is a creation of his own with dream like sequences, surrealistic scenes and character exaggeration.<br /><br />Amarcord may not be Fellini's finest film but it surely his most delightful one and a true classic in its own right.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Amarcord comes to BD courtesy of Criterion and, as expected, the results are spectacular. The transfer is very strong with superb detail, well reproduced colors and a well preserved grain layer that gives the film a natural look. Sometimes some mild noise creeps in the screen but it's nothing of serious concern. A fantastic transfer.<br /><br />The uncompressed monoaural soundtrack is also superb with astounding clarity and no signs of damage.<br /><br />Bonus Features<br />Amarcord comes with a healthy collection of bonus material that are very interesting to watch:<br />First you have a very informative documentary with professors Peter Brunette and Frank Burke, they analize key scenes in the movie and deconstruct the characters in the film. You should hear it alongside the film.<br />\\"Fellini's Homecoming\\" is a great documentary dealing with the complicated relationship between Fellini and his hometown Rimini in which the film is partially based.<br />Then you have an interesting interview with actress Magali Noel (Gradisca) in which she talks about her relationship with Fellini.<br />\\"Fellini's Drawings\\" are a collection of sketches that Fellini did during the production on Amarcord.<br />\\"Felliana\\" is a collection of publicity material for the film.<br />\\"Gideon Bachmann Interviews\\" are a series of interviews that Bachmann conducted with Fellini and his friends and family members.<br />You also have a deleted scene, the trailer, an optional English language for the film and a restoration demonstration.<br /><br />A 64 page booklet is also included which features an essay by San Rohdie \\"Federico of the Spirits\\" as well as a collection of remiscences by Fellini called \\"My Rimini\\".<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Amarcord is one of the many Fellini masterpieces and it's a must own film. It may not be a very complex film but is pure good quality entertainment. Is a must see for everyone. This Criterion BD features superb picture and sound and a lot of bonus features. This BD is Very Highly Recommended!!he film.<br />\\"Fellini's Homecoming\\" is a great documentary dealing with the complicated relationship between Fellini and his hometown Rimini in which the film is partially based.<br />Then you have an interesting interview with actress Magali Noel (Gradisca) in which she talks about her relationship with Fellini.<br />\\"Fellini's Drawings\\" are a collection of sketches that Fellini did during the production on Amarcord.<br />\\"Felliana\\" is a collection of publicity material for the film.<br />\\"Gideon Bachmann Interviews\\" are a series of interviews that Bachmann conducted with Fellini and his friends and family members.<br />You also have a deleted scene, the trailer, an optional English language for the film and a restoration demonstration.<br /><br />A 64 page booklet is also included which features an essay by San Rohdie \\"Federico of the Spirits\\" as well as a collection of remiscences by Fellini called \\"My Rimini\\".<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Amarcord is one of the many Fellini masterpieces and it's a must own film.

B005E8KQPM|5.0|Astonishing, to say the least.  Opeth's new release is, to my own perception, THE masterpiece for this band.  Drifting from the death-metal essence, HERITAGE does not lack the distinct energy and feel that other Opeth albums comprise.  Not enough stars in the rating scale are available for grading this superb album.
B005W3G2D4|4.0|Last time I reviewed All I Ever Wanted was without the songs from the Deluxe version. Which in my opinion are some of the best of that collection. So I'm going to hold off giving a complete review, but I will give my opinion on the songs on the standard MP3 download/CD. Disclaimer: Like most here I go way back to 2001 with Kelly. Voted my fingers off and support every move she's made. Felt every release has been worth the money up to this point.<br /><br />1. Breaking our own heart ... 3 stars. I like it. It's slow and gentle and I was surprised to find it the first track. Normally an artist like Kelly would feature one of the big anthems... so it put me in the frame of \\"okay, this is going to be a little different than normal.\\" Great vocals, love the voice, nice melody.<br /><br />2. Dark Side ..... 5 stars. Awesome. Classic Kelly anthem. Reminds me of Miss Independent. Not the lyrics of course, but the construction of the song. Should be a big hit.<br /><br />3. Einstein ... 3 stars. Dance beat, but I can't imagine trying to dance to it. A bit simplistic for my tastes. Vocals somewhat limited. Kelly's not testing herself on this one.<br /><br />4. Hello ... 3 stars. Like Einstein, but up tempo, a little catchy, but it doesn't get stuck in my head. Again, Kelly's not pushing herself on these.<br /><br />5. Honestly .... 4 stars. It reminds me of Irvine a little bit (which I love.) Pushing herself a bit more here. Not quite an anthem, but I like it.<br /><br />6. I Forgive You . 1 stars. It starts off feeling old, picks up some in the middle and then gets old fast. She's trying, her voice is good, but it's just boring to me. Sorry Kelly.  I forgive you.<br /><br />7. Let Me Down ... 3 stars, classic Kelly vocals. But the song has no hook, so I doubt it'll do very well on it's own.<br /><br />8. Mr. Know It All. .... 4 stars. Classic Kelly. Excellent song.<br /><br />9. Standing In Front of You ....- 3.5 stars. Slow song, tender vocals. Reminds me of Thankful.<br /><br />10. War is Over .. 2 stars. Seems rehashed. Sweet voice, but nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />11. What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger. ....- 4.5 stars. Great msg, great song. great hook. Love it. Classic Kelly.<br /><br />12. You Can't Win .. 2 stars. It sounds like she's trying, but the song just isn't cooperating. Doesn't work for me.<br /><br />13. You Love Me. ..- 2.5 stars. Doesn't really work for me. A bit boring.<br /><br />Thus far, I have to say just an okay effort. Dark Side is clearly the best song so far. What Doesn't Kill You..., and Honestly are worth the money... as is Mr. Know it All, but the rest .. I'm not so sure about. Most of the songs seem to have a \\"1/2 beat off\\" feel to them. Like they are not in synch. Maybe it's just me. :)<br /><br />Let's hope the deluxe songs pull it up. :) Thank you Kelly. You are still tops with me.11.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I am rarely compelled to write a product review (this might be my first on Amazon), but I am so impressed with this case and screen protector! The case itself is attractive, fits perfectly, and feels solid and durable.  It's smooth but has enough grip that the phone won't slip out of your hand. Screen protector was super easy to apply. Love that it came with the cover. For the price this is a really quality product. Thanks Amazon!!
0143106465|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

014310652X|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B004YJMQCS|3.0|I saw this back in 2009 it was tense fun and funny.I enjoyed every minute of it except a few things.The ACTING was a huge letdown and sure the FD movies have never been known for high caliber acting but still this was a letdown.   The 2 girl characters were extremely grating everytime they talked horrible actors and just flat out annoying.The main character was very good looking but bland not that interesting to say the least.The stereotypical jerk guy was very cute and someone I was rooting to die the whole time.Mikael Williamson I think thats his name anyways was pretty interesting as a former alcoholic who had lost his family due to an accident.Was not pleased with what happened to him that is all I will say.It was cruel extremely fast and just plain cold.   The deaths ranged from meh to pretty good won't say which or whose deaths in case someone has still not seen this movie.   The 3d was awesome for the most part but after a while it got boring with stuff popping out every few minutes. After a while it became predictable.The ending however I did not see coming and thought it was a great twist.Will not give it away but suffice it to say you should never think for one minute that you are SAFE in a FD movie. Overall a good entry to the franchise a great opening sequence at a race track some good acting some horrible and a clever twist at the end I did not see coming.This is not by no means the BEST FD not by a long shot to me the 2nd one was the best so far.I have still not seen the recent one the 5th one in 3d so I can not make an opinion of that as of yet.

Having heard it, there are a few points that stand out:<br /><br />Performance quality - some reviewers have commented on the inferiority of performers of this work versus the soundtracks. On the soundtracks, they had as many takes as they wanted and studio funding to cover the cost. For this recording, I know that most of it was taken from a live performance - which means one, maybe two takes. Given this caveat, the performance on these discs is of a very high standard. The trained ear will notice some imperfections.<br /><br />The music - An entirely subjective opinion is that Shore did an excellent job combining themes and attempting to make an effective large musical structure out of his cues for the movies. The music suffers from a lack of variety of tempo - much of it moves at the same calm, steady pace. This is only a problem if the melodic material is not sufficiently varied. Movements One and Two form a complete suite by themselves, mostly using material from the Fellowship of the Ring. The sense of the larger structure is quite evident here, as the emergence of the Fellowship theme at end of Movement Two - after much hinting - provides a good sense of closure. Movement Three used some of my favorite themes from The Two Towers, including the Rohan theme (which strangely appears nowhere else in the Symphony). Movements Four and Five I felt to drag and wander a little bit (Five worse than Four in this regard), though by this time you've listened to over an hour's worth of music with another half-hour still to come. Movement Six almost returns to the variety of the first three movements, and wraps up well; we hear the Fellowship theme again, as well as the Shire theme, both of which help create a sense of an organic whole. To Shore's credit, the Fellowship theme is not over-used at all, but the vagueness I found in Movements Four and Five comes I think from not having a second primary theme to assist in tying the work together.<br /><br />The LOTR Symphony won't blow the doors off many classically structured symphonies, but it is a great effort by composer Howard Shore to create a leisurely musical tour of Middle Earth. I found it wonderfully relaxing - not the kind of disc to play while driving, but perfect for a lazy, sun-drenched afternoon where your mind has the freedom to wander uninhibited to Tolkien's universe.heme is not over-used at all, but the vagueness I found in Movements Four and Five comes I think from not having a second primary theme to assist in tying the work together.

B000LN7HUC|5.0|I have been using this for a few months now and it's has become an indispensable part of my kit. I like to take as little with me as possible when I go on a hike.  I originally used this as a backup cook kit incase I was unable to get a good cooking fire going. Now I bring it on every trip. It boils 2 cups of water in about 10 minutes in good conditions, which is perfect for a pack of ramen or some rice. The whole kit nests nicely and you can store fuel in the stove which is REALLY nice. My only complaints are with the simmer ring. the coating on the top of the simmer ring melted off the first time I used it to simmer something, and there is no way to open or close the simmer ring without taking it off the burner and doing so  which means you need a pair of gloves if you don't want to get burned). Small complaints for a wonderful setup. I highly recomend it!

B000XAE3IM|1.0|you are getting a copy that is worth $10 at best. Misleading Image and description that makes you think you are buying the original Battery. This business is based on the experience that most customers wont return the item because they need a battery. Total unethical practice.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|No pun intended.  The &quot;next&quot; button doesn't work--just takes you back to the same level. can't unlock new levels even after you have earned the required number of stars.

1559409002|4.0|The 1962 version of the movie is creepy and corny as only it was done in the 1950's and early 1960's.  A fun scary movie for Halloween! A classic \\"B\\" style movie.  I loved \\"Saltair\\" which featured prominently in the movie as the Carnival and former dance hall.They don't make places like that anymore and that is a real horror.  Perfect for Halloween.
B004498KPU|5.0|The quality and compilation of music videos in this DVD is beyond awesome.  There were even some videos that I had not seen before on TV.  DEFINITE purchase for Michael Jackson fans......We miss you MJ.
B00000IWVS|5.0|This is monstrous piano playing.  And monstrous as a compliment.  Fabulous, belonging to the realm of the inhuman.  Playing from a time when dinosaurs still roamed the planet, seemingly.  [Postcript: Dearest Martha, did you ever commit the Chopin Etudes, both sets, to disc?  If so, will they see the light of day?  If not, what are you waiting for?]
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This is almost like a turn-based Pac-Man, except that instead of running from ghosts in lanes you are trying to cut pathways in a spiderweb to get away from a hungry, greedy spider. It is well thought out and challenging and nowhere as easy as one would think when they start playing it. A for a dollar, you really can't go wrong with this game. It is great to play whether you have a minute or a few hours to kill.  Highly recommended.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Had this cd before but lost it. With Amazon's great prices and percentage facts as to how crisp the cd is...you can't go wrong. Later days with Best Buy or Circuit City for cd's AND selection!! Absolutley love Amazon for all my cd purchases!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|There are some minor changes, but otherwise this is just like the first Gem Spinner. If you liked that one, you should pick this one up to continue play. If it didn't do anything for you then I'd skip this one altogether. If you haven't played it, then know that this is a three-gem matching game with a few twists. Primarily, everything is set up in boundaries, and you can only swap gems within those boundaries though you can match through multiple boundaries. You can move the boundaries, setting up different and interesting possibilities. And you can rotate the boundaries 180 degrees, again varying the matching you can make. I love a good thinking game and this one you have three ways to find matches which leads to a good amount of thinking and creativity. I enjoyed the first one as well as this one.
B002WPVNOS|5.0|I just love their music! Feel good music that can change your mood when any of their songs pop up the playlist!
B004V98UKS|5.0|I love a good thinking and strategy game, much like Angry Birds. This is a lot like that, except that you are moving boxes as efficiently as possible instead of knocking over buildings. You advance through levels trying to get 3 stars on each, even if you only earned less previously. It is enjoyable and well worth a dollar if you are looking for something to keep you thinking for a few hours.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Never saw or played a game like this its great. Spin boxes, replace etc wow great. Runs smooth on my mobile.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I actually tried the app before reviewing unlike some trolls on here. The graphics are clean, the gameplay is smooth, and it doesn't crash. I like the new mechanic of shuffling cells as well as the rotation of the gems. It creates a new challenge.
B0019J8KYO|5.0|So glad I found this in Spanish for a special friend in Mexico.   Great movie in any language. It is a touching story of a family's love (in particular a son) for  a mother.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|That sounds pretty childish, I know, but this book really is just--boring.  It is well written to a point, but there is really no substance to the book.  I just kept waiting for something more, but it never happened.  Not worth the hype IMO.  Could have been really great, but the author failed to make it happen on this one.
B003Y5H574|4.0|This was a positive surprise - the film turned out to be cute and charming. Complicated relations are dealt with in an amusing and yet respectful way. The characters are likeable, the actors are doing a great job and the plot was well written. Absolutely an entertaining film worth seeing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very well written biography, especially considering the fact that it is being released 3 weeks after Steve Jobs' death. The book serves as a testament to the incredible life that Steve Jobs lived and it is interesting to see how the author has tried very hard to remain immune to the famous 'reality distortion field' created by him. The author refuses to put Jobs on the pedestal. Throughout the book Steve Jobs sounds like an child obsessed with his 'vision' of reality and his greatest strengths and weaknesses are juxtaposed in the narration seamlessly. Fascinating anecdotes and conversations between Silicon Valley giants, the deals, fights and the whole process of product design and creation with Jobs at the helm makes this biography a must read! This biography also serves as a narration of the revolutionary rise of semiconductor/software industry in the Silicon Valley in the last three decades with emphasis, of course, on Apple.
B005U9RQNU|4.0|Breaking Bad is one of, if not the best T.V. series ever produced, in my opinion.  From story, location and top notch actors made breaking bad the success it is today.   I found it hard to watch anything else after the very first episode of Breaking Bad.   The New Mexico setting with all the exterior shots made it life like. A brilliant story line that will be plagiarized for a long time to come.  The choice for actors couldn't have been better. I love the way Walter White (Bryan Cranston) and Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) characters have a protagonist antagonist ark within the story line. Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) was perfect for this part and played it to perfection, great choice. All the actors were brilliant and are the perfect choices for this production. Give the Casting Director a raise.   I only started watching Breaking Bad on Netflix last month and got hooked immediately. I watched all three seasons in a month. I couldn't wait and had to buy the 4th season from Amazon.  I told my 17 year old son about it and one day a few days later at his friend's house they were scrolling through Netflix for something to watch and spotted Breaking Bad He told them that his father said that Breaking Bad was really good, so they gave it a try and they got hooked, then it spread through school like wild fire.  Simply put, Breaking Bad is just great fun. Thanks to all who made this one and  Bravo to Vince Gilligan for his keen intellect. I look forward to next season.
B004J2TPSI|4.0|I received my order two days late. The device is seemingly simple enough. I wanted to use the unit with a work PC (using Windows XP). After trying for the better part of a day, I could not get the transmitter to communicate with my bluetooth headset (which I also ordered from Amazon). I couldn't tell if it was a problem with the transmitter, the headset or with the computer itself. I had assumed that Windows would have settings that needed changing to make it all work. I emailed the seller, asking for advice, since the included instructions didn't go into enough detail about how to use the device with a PC.  Their response was to email me a PDF file of the same instructions I already had. The next day, I tried again, and this time it all worked out perfectly. It seems obvious now, but no settings needed changing on the PC or to Windows.  Overall, I give the seller/manufacturer 4 stars. They responded quickly to my initial email, but the response itself was rather weak. The instructions should be explicit in that no computer settings need changing to make the unit work properly with a computer.
0312576463|3.0|There were several times that i wondered why an editor hadn't hacked this 600 page novel down about 200 pages, but then i got to the ending and realized the fully developed characters are people i almost expect to meet on the street. Freedom is an honest approach to the awkwardness, deceit and gratification people give and get in relationships and how selfishness is always, tirelessly, at the heart of our pursuits. There are many emotions in this raw, descriptive, preachy novel and i found myself relating uncomfortably to every one. If you're in the mood for a well crafted depiction of the guilt and longing of American suburban life or just looking for some cheap therapy, pick it up.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Movies look great and sound good.  I don't ever watch the commentaries so the presence or lack thereof does not really affect me.  If you like the Star Wars movies this I think this is a great set.  It's in a slim box, looks and sound great. For an in depth, minute by minute review of the movies plot, see some of the other reviews.
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|I am a huge APP fan.  I own every APP CD and have several of their albums.  Remember those big black vinyl things?  Like most APP CD's almost every song on it is a treasure.  I enjoy this one in particular.  I went to Barcelona Spain several years after owning this CD and saw the Sagrada Familia and other Gaudi works and they were even more special after listening to this CD and loving it for years.  If you're an Alan Parson's Project fan or just love good music this one is a \\"Must Have\\".
0307888681|5.0|This is a truly fabulous read, and very frightening. Wished I'd liked it less because this kind of talent really ticks me off! (just kidding)  We could read quite a few parables into World War Z: the allowing of foreign immigrants with tuberculosis into our country (recent exposure to a high school has caused quite a scare), the failure to consider carrying capacity of this country's resources when allowing unbridled immigration: we are long past the point where immigration can be allowed as though this is the mid-1890s with land to be had for the taking.  What was most fascinating about World War Z is the premise that the zombies can be fought and that the human race, always with hope and desire and fighting spirit, can survive and get back on our feet. I really loved this book and feel a bit embarrassed at loving it so much: but cest la vie. Mr. Brooks gave us a lot to think about, not the least of which is that the first zombie (this is in the opening pages so it's not a spoiler) arises out of the vast deep waters of a dam in China. We know that China is so polluted it is in ecological collapse and that the sheer number of people creates the opportunity for viruses to rise up in ways never seen before, especially because the Chinese people still live with their animals underfoot. I saw an ecological clip of a film crew filming the pollution of abandoned garbage in China and the Chinese people watching them (shown in the film) looked like they were about to string the film crew up: the Chinese people do not like their dirty laundry, or pollution as it were, to be shown to the public.   Again, such a great book, but sooo scary for its parable to the forgotten principles that have kept our world one that provides for us. Looking forward to the movie from Brad Pitt's production company late 2012. Hope it's great.
B003JTHESA|4.0|The last 2 albums with Bruce Dickinson and the following 2 with Blaze Bayley were somewhat disappointing and that's still their worst phase. Brave New World came and everything got better. Their 4 latest albums are amazing and some of their best in a long time but especially The Final Frontier. They had their better and worse moments, their worse ones already came and now over. Virtual XI and No Prayer for the Dying are their only albums I don't like. The Final Frontier's their best album in a long time, their last album this good was Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and it's their best since then. It follows the same direction as Seventh Son took, their most progressive album since then. Sounds very similar to Seventh Son but it also has a hint of Fear of the Dark, reminds me of it a lot. The production's amazing, it's almost over-produced though. Iron Maiden are one of the few bands that have new albums as good as the old ones. This makes the latest metalcore and emo/screamo bands look pathetic compared to this. Iron Maiden are one of the top 5 best metal bands of all time and still are today. Satellite 15... The Final Frontier and El Dorodo really stand out, the rest is all good  but Starblind and The Alchemist are more of my personal favorites.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|When Bjork released her first adult solo album, \\"Debut\\", in 1993, Bjork's ecstatic voice and unique songwriting offered a refreshing take on dance-pop music. Since then, Bjork has released seven more albums, most of which towed a fine line between highly creative pop music and experimental, even otherworldly songs.<br /><br />Bjork's new album, \\"Biophilia\\" is her most ambitious, intuitive, and non-commercial album to date. (And considering Bjork's catalog, that's really saying a lot.) If you are looking for catchy, easily digestible pop music, than this is not the album for you. Even for a hardcore Bjork fan like me, it took a few complete listens to start to wrap my head around this album. At first listen, it seemed amelodic, difficult, and inaccessible. But once I gave in to it, the songs began to slowly reveal themselves to me. And I found myself in a strange, beautiful, and yet somehow familiar world.<br /><br />\\"Biophilia\\" is an intersection. Thematically, the entire album is about science. With \\"Vespertine\\" (my all-time favorite Bjork album), Bjork explored the human condition through music about intimate human relationships. With \\"Biophilia\\", Bjork explores the human condition through the context of our place in the natural world. \\"Biophilia\\" exists at the intersection between science and music, between human beings and our environment, between classical music and modern electronica, between emotion and instinct.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Not much into games myself,  but this one was intriguing because of the look and reviews.  First game i've purchased on my phone.  Worth every penny.  Just wish it were longer! Can't wait for next release.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|The album is nothing special to me. It does not compare at all two the previous albums. (Excluding Viva la Vida) The songs are for the most part vague, mainstream, and something you would see playing on the radio in the United States 1,000 times a day. Chris Martin includes Rihanna in one of his songs, which makes no sense? What happened to Parachutes? X&Y? Why is Coldplay now a mainstream, techno band, that has no meaning to listeners? They Screwed us over, having us wait a year and a half! It was all a marketing scheme to boost sales. However, a few songs I do like..

B001ECDVKE|5.0|This powerfully comic Sci-Fi DVD is rated PG-13, but I'll warn you it isn't necessarily for the faint of heart.  With a dynamic A-list cast that includes Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Annette Bening, Pierce Brosnan, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger, Tom Jones, Jim Brown Natalie Portman, Pam Grier, Lisa Marie, Lukas Haas, Jack Black, Christina Applegate, Joe Don Baker, and the comedy relief of Sylvia Sidney (along with several others you probably also know), this hour and forty-six minutes, 1996 film is worth your time; trust me.  ROFLMAO is one acronym I'd use to describe the experience.  The story of course (obviously) is that Mars invades Earth, and although the Martians do some gruesome stuff (great FX here), this movie will have you cackling if you have any funny bone at all.  Tim Burton directed this masterpiece, on a 80 million dollar budget, filmed in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Burns, Kansas; Dolan Springs, Arizona; Kingman, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Lawrence, Kansas; Washington D.C.; and Wichita, Kansas.  This is noir humor, surreal humor and political satire; becoming a parody of several B-movie Sci-Fi / Fantasy films.  A special note is that the language this film uses for the Martians is the sound of ducks - reversed.  Strap in tight, as the invaders from Mars destroy (utterly decimate) Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal, the Washington Monument, one of the Great Pyramids, Hawaii, and other famous places, as well as re-construct Mount Rushmore to resemble their own likeness.  It's a spoof people, relax - all those antiquities are not really destroyed.  The resolution for defending Earth is absolutely hilarious, although parts of this film are violent enough that Paul Newman dropped out from an early cast offer.  Yes to the connoisseurs of famous places, the hotel destroyed as part of this film is actually the true-to-life demolition of \\"The Landmark Hotel and Casino,\\" which Tim Burton personally chose to include.  Again, this is not the serious genre of \\"Independence Day,\\" but instead is a spoof meant to entertain you enough to make you slap both thighs several times as you watch \\"Mars Attacks.\\"  I recommend small sips of beverages, and small amounts of snacks - you might end up having to clean that up when you burst out laughing.  See if you can guess if I like this movie or not.nclude.

1416549447|5.0|This book was loaned to me initially by a friend when I decided to try running again. I was about to start the c25k (couch to 5k) running program. ChiRunning techniques were a tremendous help and combined with the c25k running program, I completed my 5k training right on schedule. I've always had difficulty in pushing myself past the discomfort of running and ChiRunning helps teach focus points, relaxation, and so much more. I'm not into running for the speed or a competition race.  My desire, at age 61, is just to be able to run the distance. I'm running my first 5k this weekend and I attribute ChiRunning a great deal for my success in getting this far.  I was only 1/3 of the way through the borrowed book when I decided I HAD to buy my own so I could highlight and keep going back to the references!!  If you're into running for the enjoyment and want to run injury free, I highly recommend the book. In past years when I tried to run, I'd always end up with shin splints and quit.  No shin splints with ChiRunning!!  Additionally, I ordered the book on Amazon and saved $5 from the book store price.. an my \\"used\\" copy... I couldn't even tell it had been used. It was in excellent condition. Quite a buy! It's a reference book I'll keep on my shelf and refer back to often.

I wanted one that was like the classes I go to with modern music that got you pumped up. I tried to return, the buyer seemed happy to refund, but I had to pay the shipping. I was afraid to take my chances on returning the item and not receiving my money back. I decided to just keep it and give it away when I decide to purchase the right product. Now I'm more cautious.

1439192812|5.0|Excellent and easy to understand scientific explanations of everyday things that most of us take for granted; teamed up with beautiful illustrations to help the reader understand the concepts behind the end results.  I also enjoyed reading about the mythological explanations, and our humble beginnings.  Rated and aimed toward readers 12 and up.  I'm a 32 year old grown man, and it's still fascinating to me.  Back in my day most American public schools taught these materials to 5th graders all the way up until high school, and I believe it's still relevant up until the day you die.  Whether you're a young student that might be new to this, or an older dude like me just with an interest in brushing up in the sciences, you will no doubt not want to put this down.  This one's a keeper.

Watson tackles this very issue skillfully in the book \\"Before I go to sleep\\".<br /><br />Christine, the narrator and main character, suffers from amnesia. She was involved in an incident of sorts and cannot form new memories. Every day she wakes up in a bed she doesn't know, next to a man she does not remember and 20 years older than what she thought. Every day starts the same.<br /><br />The one person that helps her through this is her husband, Ben. She also is seeing a doctor behind her husband's back and she writes in her diary daily, trying to piece together the previous days she can't remember, as well as her life. But, when she writes in her diary \\"Don't trust Ben\\" she must try to figure out how the accident happened, her life to date and whether she can trust those around her. Her life, and sanity, rests on whether she can put together and make sense of her fragmented life.<br /><br />The book itself is Christine diary. She uses it to keep track of her days, her experiences, her memories. The book is Christine's memory and the anchor to her life. S.J. Watson authored an incredible book. The narration conveys the desperation Christine feels and a sense of urgency about finding out more about Christine's accident and what has transpired in her life.<br /><br />\\"Before I go to sleep\\" is a great book. I was thoroughly enthralled by the subject matter and the narration. I don't think I was able to physically put it down. Even if I wasn't actively reading it, I had it in my hand.
B000002KDO|5.0|Thank g*d for Black Sabbath. When I was 13 I heard \\"Iron Man\\" on the radio and it threw a switch inside me that remains in the \\"on\\" position to this day. I bought \\"Iron Man\\"'s parent album Paranoid and was mesmerized from note one. Sabbath had me under their spell and soon I was digging deeper into the back catalog of this diabolical and mysterious band from way back in the misty 1970's.<br /><br />When I snuck Master of Reality home under my parents' noses one October night, I listened to it in my room with the door shut and couldn't believe it was even heavier than Paranoid. Black Sabbath had tuned their guitars down to C# and the riffs were absolutely sinister. The mix was dry as a bone and all the more terrifying for it. I hadn't previously heard any of the songs on MOR, so it was all deliciously new to me. I played it over and over.<br /><br />You probably know the album's staples: \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Sweet Leaf\\", \\"Into the Void\\". These songs are Heavy with a capital H. Plodding, deliberate, malevolent and bone crushing. But the mellow instrumental interludes (\\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\") and the blurry, psychedelic \\"Solitude\\" only add to the hallucinogenic quality of this potent, immursive listen.<br /><br />(interesting side-note: my original vinyl copy of Master of Reality had the lyrics printed on the back. I was both fascinated and confused by the seemingly Christian message of \\"After Forever\\", a lyrical anomaly in Sabbath's catalog to this day)

B005IZLPMY|5.0|The movie was good and I enjoyed it very much.  Yes, it is a super hero movie.  So, do not expect a deep, complex plot.  But, for what it is, it is fun and entertaining.  The 3D was really cool.  One day they may make 3D work without the glasses.  That would nice.

When balancing humanity against technology or profits, humanity should outweigh any innovation inhumanity may produce. After all, slavery supported the South. But did we really need all that cotton?

Keep up the wonderful job you are doing!!!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|This game has some similarities to Bejeweled, but the twist element and the ability to actually move the gems around give this game a unique and challenging shakeup to the game. Definitely good for free, but might be a stretch for most at two dollars.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|They've released some of the most revolutionary music of the last decade, with songs like Clocks, The Scientist, Fix You, Strawberry Swing, Life in Technicolor, Viva la Vida...but don't expect as much glory from Mylo Xyloto. Compared to most other artists, Mylo Xyloto is an excellent piece of work, but by Coldplay's standards, it's pretty sorry. That's not to say it's bad: just the opposite, I think it's great, but it's just not the same sound that we've grown used to from Coldplay. Now, I can't say I've been a fan of theirs for long. It was when I first heard Viva la Vida a little over a year ago that I became one. Now I've heard all of their songs and have all of their albums (except for X and Y...still have yet to buy that one), and it was those earlier works that grabbed my attention. I love their music, and I believe that they are perhaps one of the most talented bands today (excluding lead singer Chris Martin, who's more a middle-of-the-road talent...his piano playing and songwriting is unmatched. He's a role model for me in those areas. It's more his vocals, which have never been amazing...but hey, if you have something to say, it doesn't have to sound perfect!). My main gripe with this album is that it sounds extremely close to that dreaded, god-awful, bland ol', generic rock that anyone with a brain wouldn't ever listen to. It's close enough to that Coldplay sound that is unmatched to pass, but only just. The majority of Coldplay fans will probably love this as much as I do, but for those of you who are die-hard and expect them to keep the audio-revolution going may or may not be disappointed. It sounds a lot like the stuff that you hear so much on the radio...you know, the kind of music that makes you want to cut your ears off with a herring?...Well, okay not THAT bad. Nothing remotely close to that bad. All I can say is, if you can't stand that garbage on the radio, then this album will, for the most part, get old after the fifth or sixth time through (save for Paradise, which in my opinion is the best track on here).

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I never expected this to show up as free app of the day. however the luster of it wore off quick once I discovered that it is almost a complete clone of quickoffice which my droid 2 already had. the only plus side is the menu bar that stays visible.  The only downside I can see is what happens when a newer version comes out. only way to find out is to wait it out.  For those that just need the basics, this will get the job done. but don't expect alot out of this. It's not a drop in replacement for Microsoft office or whatever you happen to be used to using.
0553807919|5.0|Daniel Siegel and Tina Bryson both make this an insightful read about how to nurture your child's brain and help them develop, and ultimately THRIVE, rather than survive in such situations.<br /><br />The book is written with an easy-to-follow structure of outlining some examples, and then providing you with guidelines as to turn a surviving situation into a thriving opportunity. Instead of telling your child that you'll make everything better \\"because you say so\\" or bringing out the \\"we'll get ice cream\\" line, you can help your child understand the situation and express him/herself. That is one way to help them nurture their mind. The ability to retell a story and think back is a common theme in this book. This just among one of the approaches.<br /><br />Among some of the strategies addressed are: replaying memories, teaching that feelings come and go, engaging the logical side of the brain, family fun, etc. The 12 strategies addressed, as well as the many introductions and insightful explanations are extremely helpful to parenting style and the individual. Some of the research about the brain show ways to understand yourself before you can help your child. Helping yourself before you can help others, you could call it.<br /><br />This book is a brief read with helpful charts and drawings. At the end of the book there is a \\"refrigerator sheet\\" that highlights some tips to remember. There is also a section called \\"Whole-brain stages and ages\\" which show ages, stages, and possible things you can do to help your child thrive at different points in their lives.<br /><br />All in all, this books has opened my eyes to rich and useful information that can be applicable to parenting. Although the book is about helping your child grow, it's also about how well you take of yourself too. The authors emphasize that a healthy, whole-brain parent will do so much and influence their children positively. I've also realized that much of the information about the brain - memories, logic, linguistics, emotions, fears - can be helpful to not only parents, but also anyone seeking to learn more about the brain. Great read, highly recommended.can be helpful to not only parents, but also anyone seeking to learn more about the brain. Great read, highly recommended.

B001HN6922|5.0|People giving Cars 2 a bad rept saying that its not up there with the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, Up, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc, any other Pixar film, Dreamworks Animation films (How to Train Your Dragon, Kung Fu Panda, Shrek) Blue Sky (Rio, Ice Age), Despicable Me, Rango or any other hit animated movie in the last couple of years, its not as bad as what critics think about this sequel,yes, Mater goes a long way from being the comic relief character in the first Cars film as now more as a main character in this film leaving Lighting Macqueen as a supporting character this time around but come on at least nobody is crying like Toy Story 3 and Up in the last two Pixar hits. Pixar's first box office disappointment and critical failure isn't the end of the world yet that every animated studio gets a misfire fit now and then that its better that any bad animated film. See this on dvd and blu-ray for the Toy Story short and try to turn your brain off when watching this just like people turn their brains off for Green Lantern. Think about other bad animated movies twice before seeing this. Next year with be better with Brave, the next Pixar blockbuster!

B002BSHXJA|4.0|After listening to these mono mixes closely for several months, I'm now utterly convinced that THIS is the way The Beatles were meant to be heard. With the exception of a few tracks on the White Album, the overall impact of the songs is greater when compared to the rather tinny-sounding stereo mixes. All the albums have a warmer, more organic feel and reveal little details I've never noticed before (Ringo's drumming is a lot more forceful and muscular than I ever realized) and the vocals blend nicely with the backing tracks, especially in the case of \\"Rubber Soul\\", unlike the original 1987 CD release which always aggravated me with its terrible 2-channel separation. I'm very pleased with my purchase & nice work EMI!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book was easily one of the best that I have read in years. It had intrigue, suspense, romance, mystery, everything that a good book needs.

I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Jason Mratz, Bruno Mars, Adele, and similar styles of music.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|An app that lets you view AND edit Office doc. Works great! I am a college student so I use MS Office almost every day. This app will make my life much easier.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I purchased QuickOffice Pro (QOP) several months ago, but I decided to try OfficeSuite Pro 5 (OSP) when it was offered as the FAOTD. I found that OSP is better for editing and creating documents, but QOP is better for viewing.  I don't see myself creating anything complex on a mobile device, but I still appreciate the extra features in OSP. Compared to QOP, it has more spreadsheet functions, and it can easily add bullets and numbered lists to \\"Word\\" documents.  I also viewed several files in both apps. For PDFs, QOP loaded pages more quickly, and I could take advantage of embedded bookmarks, which I couldn't do in OSP. Both apps had similar performance for .doc, .docx, and .xls, opening every document except a large spreadsheet with macros. (In earlier testing, only Documents To Go could open that last file.) However, OSP had trouble with .xlsx. It opened the file, but it failed to load all my columns, even though the file opened without trouble in QOP. I'm sure this is a bug that will be fixed in a future update, so I'm not giving a bomb review, but it is a significant issue. If that's fixed soon, I'll give more stars. If not, I'll uninstall OSP.  If you can get OSP when it's the FAOTD, definitely do so. Otherwise, I can't recommend paying for it right now because of the issue with .xlsx files. However, if that's fixed, OSP will be my preferred app because of the improved editing functions. That said, both apps are fine for basic use.  Update: Between very responsive customer service and a reinstallation, I was able to view .xlsx files properly. Even though I'd never use this as a substitute for Office on my main computer, I now consider it a 5-star app that will take QOP's place on my phone. (I considered 4 stars since it can't handle large files with multiple macros, but the customer service deserves an extra star!)
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Reviews were mixed for Green Lantern although all the trailers I viewed indicated that it would be a movie that I would thoroughly enjoy. And I was right. From beginning to end Green Lantern is a special effects extravaganza and an entertaining origin story. I generally do not care for origin stories because being familiar with a superhero character means I already know the story and would rather see something new. With Green Lantern we really have the best of both worlds. The movie does not delay in placing the ring of power on the finger of Hal Jordan. From there we watch as Hal struggles to meet the burden placed upon him while the Earth is threatened by Parallax one of the Guardians of Oa that has turned evil.<br /><br />There is good character development with Hal who is depicted as being a womanizing cocky and brash pilot to a responsible superhero. The CGI is top notch and the depiction of Oa, the guardians and many of the other aliens that are a part of the intergalactic Green Lantern Corps rivals the special effects seen in the more recent Star Wars prequels. The relationship between Hal and Dr. Hector Hammond, who is infected with the yellow power of Parallax, could have been better fleshed out and brought to more depth. The same could be said with Hal's relationship with Carol Farris. There seems to be little justification for the affection between the two given the characterization of their earlier antagonism toward one another.<br /><br />Parallax has a habit of easily defeating the other Green Lanterns in the Corps and after the Guardians of Oa refuse to help him, with the encouragement of Sinestro a future supervillian, Hal faces the Corps most notorious villain alone.  I won't give away the ending and although origin stories can be predictable, as this one certainly is, the story is told in a manner which is exciting and entertaining. I am unabashedly a CGI junkie and this movie delivers on that account. Therefore combined with a story that is pretty riveting despite its predictability along with great eye candy The Green Lantern is a good introduction for this underdog and little known superhero.riveting despite its predictability along with great eye candy The Green Lantern is a good introduction for this underdog and little known superhero.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I expected this book to be insightful and inspiring. Insightful, yes. But surprisingly it was more entertaining (especially towards the end) than inspiring. There were parts I had to run to another room and share, and other parts I could not help myself but to laugh out loud.<br /><br />I would have preferred a deeper analysis into Steve Jobs' motivations. Instead, this book seemed to frequently digress into the topic of Apple and Silicon Valley ... a lot more than I felt was necessary. Almost like a grade school biography of Patton which would break off frequently and discuss the general progress of the War to give the readers some background. Nevertheless, the book was very enjoyable. And the Kindle version was excellent.

B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch has brought us another great album and coming along with it of course is their unique style of play. The album starts off hard with their title track and then with my favorite, which is also the single, \\"Under and Over it.\\" The whole cd is very pleasing and pretty catchy. It'll make you take out that air guitar and start playing along with them. This band doesn't seem like they are gonna slow down any time soon, they are just gonna get stronger by each passing day and their fans are as die hard as they come!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|For just under $30 this handle seems to be a great deal.  I expected it to be a bit more sturdy.  It's all plastic and holding a Canon 7D on it seems safe so far, but it might be better for lighter cameras.  I have my 28-135 zoom lens on it and if I get bigger lenses the durability will be more in question.  DSLRs are not video friendly in terms of their shape and ergonometry so having this handle will be very beneficial.  The box claims that it \\"Easily mounts to tripod or monopod\\" which as far as I can tell so far is a false claim.  I've only just received it so my review is based only on the out-of-box reaction.  Bottom line thus far:  I don't regret buying something that will probably be very convenient and used often for only $30.

B004LSO6YI|5.0|This movie was awesome!!! The intensity between Elena and Peyton was completely and utterly believable!  The intensity and chemistry there was crazy!  My props go out to whoever cast those two B-E-A-utiful ladies!  The story line was believable and filled with hope, while not just losing itself to sappy love story blah blah, instead this movie had depth and feeling where most modern movies lack such complexity.  This movie is now on my top 5 favorite movies, only taking second to my coming out movie which was Imagine Me & You, and believe me when I say this is a complete compliment seeing that the other movie is the only film Ive watched more than ten times.  Definitely a must see.  Now Im off to find this on DVD to add to my collections.  Congrats to all the poeple who put forth effort to create such a fabulous movie.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|It's an odd addition to the \\"Cars\\" name, but an abundance of humor, action, and beautiful visuals show just how unappreciated \\"Cars 2\\" really is.   You know something, I've never really understood why people always told me that \\"Cars\\" was the worst Disney Pixar film ever made. From what I've read, the story isn't as appealing as other works in the Disney Pixar line up, and friends tell me they just didn't care for the characters. I, of course, am in the minority of audience members who fell that \\"Cars\\" is no different in terms of charm and lovability from the rest of Disney Pixar's film line up. I've always stuck to my guns claiming that \\"Cars\\" is just as amazing as the likes of \\"Toy Story\\" or \\"Up\\", because I found myself learning to love the characters of the \\"Cars\\" world, and felt the story was both endearing and charismatic. Then came the poor reviews for \\"Cars 2\\"; a movie I had been greatly anticipating since it's announcement. Again, everyone was saying the story was nowhere near as well done as previous entries in Disney Pixar's movie line up; and I was completely bummed. It almost made me not even bother seeing it at all; since I felt it would ruin the built up reputation I posses in my head of how amazing each and every Disney Pixar film. I know when you're trying to be a good movie critic, one mustn't allow themselves to be swayed by public opinion, but I just couldn't help but feel a little let down; even before I saw the film itself. Thankfully, I finally built up the nerve to ignore the harsh reviews and sit down at the Cinema Center to watch it myself. I decided to just clear my mind of the bad publicity, and just watch it with the open mind a good critic should posses. From what I have gathered from the reviews other critics have lined before me and from what I personally saw in \\"Cars 2\\", I know now that overall public opinion should never dictate whether you choose to see a film or not. \\"Cars 2\\" is, in fact, an amazing piece of art from the Disney Pixar team. \\"Cars 2\\" has almost all of the original characters from the first film, excluding Doc Hudson because of Paul Newman's death. This time around, Lightning McQueen has won 4 Piston Cups since his first attempt in the first film, and is planning on taking a break from the racing world to pal around with his best friend Mater, and to spend quality time with his girlfriend Sally. When Mater hears of the news that Lightning rejected an entry opportunity to participate in the first ever \\"World Grand Prix\\", and additionally hears Lightning's rival Francesco's mockery of McQueen, he calls in to the news broadcaster to personally tell Francesco how well Lightning would mop the floor with him. This, subsequently, forces Lightning to accept the entry offer and participate. The World Grand Prix has all drivers completely powering themselves with a new alternative fuel source called Allinol; and major fuel tycoons are trying to stop the fuel from making a huge public splash for patrons to turn away from gasoline. The threat that lies within the race is all too dangerous, and British spies Finn McMissile and Holly Shiftwell are there to figure out who specifically is causing all this chaos. After accidentally mistaking Mater for their American counterpart, Mater is thrown into a world of action and espionage to help Finn and Holly figure out what's truly going on behind the races. Mater tries to do his best for both the spy team, and Lightning, but begins to feel like he's more of a problem than actual help. In order for everyone to succeed, Lightning must set away his pride, Finn and Holly must do whatever's necessary, and Mater must look within himself to be the great car he knows he really is. After everything I had read on why \\"Cars 2\\" was so bad, I found myself completely shocked to see that there was really nothing wrong with the film at all. The story may be the strongest ever, but it still holds itself very well because of the still lovable Pixar characters and exotic locations. The visuals are even better than the previous \\"Cars\\" entry, and it's even funnier as well! The fact that so many critics were so willing to pan this film amazes me; there's no change in my admiration for how well Disney Pixar makes a good film. Everything from music, to story, to characters fits well with the name, and I don't see myself falling for the critical buzz again. Now, let's point out something really quick though. I do understand when some say this Pixar movie doesn't have the same amount of charm behind it; I do somewhat agree here. When comparing it to the previous \\"Cars\\" in terms of charm, it doesn't have the same amount and uses a more mature kind of charm with itself; sort of like Up's charm, although I do feel Up was better. This film actually deals with cars dying throughout it; which you would expect from a spy type film, but I didn't really see it coming with a Pixar one. It doesn't hamper it in any way, but I just though I'd point it out. Oh, and one last thing before I give a final summary if how much I liked \\"Cars 2\\". What I mean by, \\"An odd entry\\", is that the whole spy theme going on in this entry feels like it could have easily been used in a different Pixar film; like a new film series about spies. I don't know why they used it specifically for \\"Cars\\" and to make a \\"Cars\\" film surrounding it, but nevertheless, it's still a well done film overall. So to sum everything up, \\"Cars 2\\" is a highly under-appreciated Disney Pixar film. Story, visuals, characters, music, scenery, and so much more I felt was done right and just wasn't noticed as well as it should have been by so many others. Besides, it's about talking cars that can fly, swim, and do karate; what can you possibly hate about a movie that has that? It's nowhere near predictable and anyone who looks past the negative reviews surrounding it will find the same amount of Disney Pixar charm they've come to know and love with the other entries they've done so well.

I am always looking for brain teasers, so those were fun to try as well.  It isn't always possible to come up with the best solution in an interview setting, but this book goes far in preparing one for the mindset required to do well in an interview.  I feel more confident and better prepared to face such interviews.

B00007KWHP|5.0|Yes' fourth album was released in November 1971 and was the first to feature new keyboardist Rick Wakeman as well as the first to feature art by Roger Dean. Original keyboardist Tony Kaye had been replaced during rehearsals for the album. The album switches between band performances and individual members songs. The album opens with Roundabout which would be a massive hit for the band. Unfortunately, both this and the Joe Gastwirt remaster do away with the cool stereo panning between Steve's guitar and Rick's organ during the \\"in and out of the lake\\" section. Cans and Brahms is new guy Rick Wakeman's chance to shine with his version of a classical piece Brahms. Jon then gets his We Have Heaven before giving way to a rocking song called South Side of the Sky performed by the whole band. The song is about mountain climbers who get lost in the snow and end up freezing to death. The second half of the album begins with drummer Bill Bruford's percussion piece Five Per Cent for Nothing. Long Distance Roundaround is another full band song with a nice little loop with gives way to Chris' The Fish. Steve Howe get a pretty classical guitar piece with Mood for a Day. The album ends with the entire band doing the album's longest song Heart of the Sunrise which is just wonderful. The bonus songs on here are a version of Paul Simon's America that was performed live by the band in their early days and was recorded on a sampler called The New Age of Atlantic and better known for it's appearance on Yesterdays. The disc ends with an early mix of Roundabout.
0345529057|3.0|The price is very decent, you can get each book new for 5 bucks.  The story is overall good, many parts of the book keep you entertained.  I only have one book left to finish the so far series and my complain for now is that although overall interesting, the author tends to be very superfluous.  A couple of these books could have been 500-600 pages instead of 1,000.  Author is redundant, some chapters are dull and should have not been included and it seems like if the story had been written knowing that in the future there could be a TV show where they could have it for many seasons and make money...it is just too long and not that great when compared to other classical novels such as those of J.R.R. Tolkien.

1410430103|3.0|Killing Floor is the fourth Jack Reacher novel I have read, and the first in the series.  Three of the four I've read have similar broad plot lines:  a small rural town that is corrupted by, beholden to, and/or terrified by an evil family or employer, until Jack Reacher walks into town and kills all the bad guys.  In other words, a Samurai movie.  Child's books are good enough to make me want me to read a few more, but I am hoping for more diversity.

1597801585|5.0|DISCLAIMER: I bought this book in a little Indie Shop in NYC.  Just found it on a shelf, who'd'ov thunk.<br /><br />The Windup Girl was not an easy book to read.  I've read a number of negative reviews of this book and while I don't agree I understand how this happened.  I couldn't read more than 3 or 4 chapters at a time without my ears starting to leak gray matter.  But please, don't let that stop you.  The Windup Girl is both terrifying and hopeful, devastating and beautiful.  The dichotomy of humanity has never been captured as well as Bacigalupi did in here.<br /><br />I've talked a lot in the past about world building and how a quality book, especially sci-fi, doesn't stop at location.  A quality book builds a world using history, anthropology, science, sociology, genetics, religion and politics.  All of these factors exist in The Windup Girl and more.  Bacigalupi tackles biology, evolution, family and the essential question of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Strangely, the most human character in the entire book is the one who is considered to not have a soul.  Emiko is a Windup, one of the New People, built and bred for specific purposes.  The society of The Windup Girl is obsessed with Niche.  Everyone has a place and in a time when resources are scarce and hope is extinct, clinging to ones role is what keeps order and sanity in an insane world.  Emiko's Niche is as a servant.  Bred to obey, designed to give and experience pleasure, her innocence and crisis of self is the most engaging of the plots.  However, without the others her story would lack the context which makes it so powerful and heartbreaking.<br /><br />While The Windup Girl is a fictional novel speculating on the future of the world if we continue to mess with the genes of our food it's one that feels very familiar.  It isn't hard to imagine a world where rickshaw's replace cars because there is no fuel left, or where carbon emission allotments are sold on the black market to the highest bidder. The threat of a virus or strain of an illness which we cannot defeat is in the back of our minds already. Antibiotic resistant strep and recalled Cantaloupe already infect our modern world.  Take that reality to the extreme and you have Bacigalupi's novel.<br /><br />For my part I was exceptionally happy with The Windup Girl.  It was a full story, that surprised and challenged with uncomfortable questions on the nature of humanity.  Bacigalupi used every resource the writer has available, from research to religion to pure fantasy, to create something completely original.  I highly recommend this novel to everyone.<br /><br />Oh and because I'm an Indie Author and I'm so sick of hearing about typos I'd like to point out that this Hugo Award winning, Nebula Prize novel had a number of typos, specifically on pages 276 and 307.  My favorite was: \\"The scooter slews to a stop and she hops down.\\" Guess what word he meant.  So the next time you find an error or two in a self published novel consider this before you blast it all over the internet.bidder.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A ripping yarn, well paced and thoughtfully put together.  Stories centered around a love triangle usually leave me cold but in this case Ms. Collins didn't allow the romantic complications to overwhelm her core story (looking at you, Laurell Hamilton).  Although clearly written for a younger audience, the book held my attention to the end and left me wanting more.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Using [[ASIN:B0052P6DQI Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016]], entering review with Dolphin HD.<br /><br />While I would have preferred an application integrated with ANY cloud, this will do nicely.  It goes above and beyond the specs described - I can create Docs, Spreadsheets, and Presentations. Also, if you are working from the Remote Files location, your new Doc is saved directly to Google Docs. You can also save in different formats.  I personally don't use presentations, but PDFs and PDF books are now easily shared (though most of my User Manuals are stored on my SD card).<br /><br />The application can be set to a document folder locally on the full size SD card.  For Thrive owners, that is storage/sdcard-disk0/Documents (you will need to set up the Documents folder on the SD card first, the application will create a folder in the sdcard-disk0 folder for you).<br /><br />I can now upload my monthly budget and expense worksheet, shopping lists, documents I'm working on - and not be tied to my oversized laptop.  There is a persistent process, looks like it is related to verifying if this is a legit copy (MS hello).<br /><br />For this complaining about permissions, these are to access your external storage, and to integrate your Google account.  After authorizing the application for access to Goggle Docs, you are good to go (watch that storage size folks) :-  1 star dock for having to do external work not documented (figured out on own), and persistent process (really not needed in a tablet).<br /><br />Happy Android Tabbing.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) isn't exactly cut out for the Army: he's short, scrawny, and asthmatic.  In essence, he's the exact opposite of what Uncle Sam is looking for.  Yet Steve just can't wait to get over to Germany and kick some Nazi butt.  A scientist (an almost unrecognizable Stanley Tucci) admires Rogers's ambition, as well as his good heart, and enlists him in a special Army program, against the wishes of Colonel Phillips (a deadpan Tommy Lee Jones).  Rogers come out of the experiment stronger and smoother, and teams up with a feisty female (tough-as-hell Hayley Atwell), his best bud (super-suave Sebastian Stan), and scientist Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper doing a dead-on Robert Downey Jr.) to take on the evil Johann Schmidt (the always-sinister Hugo Weaving) and his cohort (Toby Jones.<br /><br />CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER has one solid thing going for it (no, not that god-awful title): its cast.  Everywhere is admirably cast, and while a few get underused (both Joneses, for example), and still others don't get much time to shine (Weaving is perfect when he's Schmidt, but as Red Skull, the special effects kind of get away from him), throughout these characters remain relatable and intriguing.  We genuinely root for Rogers, and though Captain America comes off as a bit of a d***** (rhymes with \\"whoosh\\"), that could be intentional.  Director Joe Johnston knows what he's doing, at least: crafting a middle-of-the-road superhero flick, something meant to tide us over until THE AVENGERS gets here (the set-up for the latter is actually interesting; not believable or original, but interesting).<br /><br />It seems I'm heaping a lot of criticism on the film.  Well, I am.  But note those 4 stars.  CAPTAIN AMERICA shouldn't be taken for anything more than it is.  It's not a great comic book film; merely a good one.  But hell, that's better than so many others out there.  If nothing else, it makes the 1940s look spectacular; kudos to Johnston for knowing how to make a period piece.  Watch this film if you're a fan of the comics, enjoy a good action/adventure yarn, or want to know all the pieces of the puzzle before seeing THE AVENGERS.  You won't be blown away, but you won't be bored, either..

1451648537|2.0|So you want insight?  I don't know Steve Jobs. However, based on what I know about his life, I think I have seen something that is much deeper. Here's my personal idea about Steve Jobs as a con man:  Steve Jobs was not an inventor. He could dream but he could not invent. When you talk about Pablo Picasso, you talk about a genius who had been a well-trained classical painter while he was a kid. Pablo Picasso could paint. On the other hand, Steve Jobs has never had anything under his name. Apple II was totally designed by Steve Wozniak. Apple III, Lisa, Macintosh 128k, NeXT, iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad were created by Apple and NeXT engineers with some input from Steve Jobs. Anything prior to iMac were business blunders. Jobs could make some critical aesthetic decisions. He brought the kids to Xerox. He flew the pirate flag. He humiliated and fired people. At the end of the day, we all know that Steve Jobs was not an engineer after all. He was not among the same league as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Andrew Grove. He was nothing but a successful salesman. A gourmet is not a chef. We praise great chefs. We just treat gourmets as ... gourmets.  To be an inventor or a master of something, you must be more than Steve Jobs. Thomas Edison was in the labs. Frank Lloyd Wright was the chief designer of his buildings (even though he failed to put enough structural support for his famous Fallingwater). You must control a key aspect of your design to be a master of something. Certainly Steve Jobs could tell you that the Objective C is great. But could he tell you the differences between Objective C and the original C, or C++, or C#? Could you imagine Steve Jobs solving a hardware problem? He did not even have an industrial design created by him directly! The elegant Apple II case was designed by some designer with the opinions from Steve Jobs.  This lack of expertise made Steve Jobs a very harsh and picky man. He could not write a line of code or build a USB-powered fan (he hatesfans anyway). As a result, he invented his bad attitude to ride these highly intelligent engineers. You know it's like rodeo. You show them who's the boss.  He could not argue with the engineers over any technical matter. He chose aesthetics as his battlefield. As we all know that engineers are ... well ... you know it. This helped him to sit on top of these bright kids. Then you may ask why did they listen to Steve Jobs? Money. It's the money that matters.  Steve Jobs knew it pretty well that money is the only thing that could buy him any dignity. Bill Gates knows computers. He can give you a lecture on any aspect of programming for a whole semester or more. Steve Jobs knew nothing but money. As a result, when Apple went IPO, he gave many early-day engineers not even one share of AAPL. Steve Wozniak gave them about 1/3 of his shares. Steve Jobs needed the money to stay on top of the engineers to control them.  After he was kicked out of Apple, Steve Jobs used his AAPL money to start NeXT which was a miserable business failure. He bought Pixar and let them do the good job. It was his FIRST SUCCESS. He did not do too much. HE COULD NOT ARGUE WITH THESE ARTISTS OVER AESTHETICS ISSUES! He could not control Pixar because Pixar has John Lasseter and many others who are more creative and skillful than Steve Jobs. If Steve Jobs wanted to control Pixar, they can just resign and start another company. Then he returned to Apple. Now he got rid of anything created by the previous regime. Now he populated Apple with his NeXT guys who knew how to work for Steve Jobs and survive Steve Jobs.  During the early 1980s, most engineers in Apple had Steve Wozniak as their hero.  Now these NeXT boys and newcomers had Steve Jobs as their God. As long as they have money they are willing to be abused. Steve Jobs did not change. The World changed. Apple changed. As long as he still has the money. Thanks to Wozniak and his Apple II.  This is what makes the 21st century Apple different from the 1980s Apple. Finally, Steve Jobs had the men and women are controllable ... well, with his money ...  Steve Jobs was a con man because he tried to make you believe that he was the brain behind something. He used his money to control his engineers and steal their glory. He wants you to remember iPod, iPhone and iPad. He wants you to forget the rest.  Isaacson's story about Steve Jobs is a failure because he failed to give readers an insightful look into Steve Jobs. He tried to fillup his book with stories that have alredy been told. I think he failed to escape from Steve Jobs' Reality Distortion Field.  I can't agree with Mr. Isaacson's view that adoption was the cause of Steve Jobs' undesirable personality. No. I think Steve Jobs shall be ashamed of it. You can manipulate or control other people. Just don't use your foster parents as the excuse of your behavior. Manipulation is not a crime. No one's gonna send you to jail because you know how to control other people. Just leave your foster parents alone. They were some of the most loving and helpful parents on Earth. It's your choice to use other people so you can have money and power. Why could't you see it, Steve?  As to his legacy. We do not know if he has passed on some of his legacy to the ones in need. He had lived a very successful life collecting money so he could control people. Now what did he want to do with the money. I can't help it but think about Frankenstein and some other nice SF stories.  On the other hand, I think as a cultural icon, Steve Jobs was in no comparison with Howard Hughes. Hughes was much smarter. He was more capable. He was weirder. Howard Hughes died less than a week after the founding of Apple Computer. I bet that the story of Hughes would live on much longer than that of Steve Jobs.  So you want to know Steve Jobs?  =========  Did you guys know anything about Atari's Breakout affair? Almost all books that talked about this shameful betrayal mentioned Nolan Bushnell's offer: $5000to $7000 (depending on the source). This authorized author seemed to skipped this highly important number. He described Woz's $350 as a \\"base fee\\". I have never heard of this \\"base fee\\" from any source. He also mentioned that Steve Jobs pocketed the \\"bonus\\". It looks like Steve Jobs only pocketed the bonus part of Atari's payment. To me, this is highly suspicious. It looks like that the author has tried his best to cover up something.  You may consult Apple Confidential 2nd ed. for better researched information. You may visit folklore.org for early Apple employees' versions of this story.

0792164903|5.0|While not a big fan of Tim Burton's films, most of his films don't move<br />me as they do many. However, Sleepy Hollow (SH) is the exception. I<br />really can find no fault with this film. I think Burton's take on a<br />two-hundred year old story is, in my opinion, fresh. I prefer Ichabod<br />Crane the constable to Ichabod Crane the teacher. In SH Crane is not<br />only investigating the Headless Horseman but the less than supernatural<br />conspiracy behind the murders taking place.<br /><br />SH boasts an acting cast about as perfectly cast as can be had, with<br />nary a bad performance to be had. Depp's portrayal of Crane is one only<br />Depp could have delivered. What I enjoyed most were the set designs and<br />locations. Burton was able to somehow create a sense of beauty and<br />foreboding in this film. The special effects were spot on and even over<br />a decade later do not seem dated.<br /><br />SH is an excellent blend of story, imagery, special effects, and<br />suspense. I watch it every October as it fits right in with the season<br />as do apple cider and pumpkins. Watch this on a chill and dark autumn<br />night and I bet you will get the wonderful scary sensation that will<br />send you to sleep feeling nervous and leave you feeling frightened when<br />you hear a board creek or the trees rustle.

B003YOXIVW|4.0|I was looking for this album in June of this year and was intrigued that there was a remaster version from 2010 available.  I've always thought there were some good songs on this album but the album as a whole was - pretty good but not great.  My wife was interested in this album so I was seeking out a copy for her.  Of course with any CD purchase, I had to critically analyze the remastering job and I must say I'm impressed.  There is some clarity in the mid range and bass frequencies that I didn't detect before, but the timbrel balance is still pleasing.  Dynamic range is also very lifelike.  It's amazing how good an album can sound when they optimize the loudness for the CD medium, but still leave the dynamic range intact.  I find it hard to believe that this was mastered by the same person (Tony Cousins) who mastered the recent Genesis reissues.  The approach on the two projects are completely different.  I think this may be proof that Peter Gabriel did not have input on the green Genesis box set, at least as far as the audio production on the stereo CDs was concerned.  If you love this album, this 2010 remaster is highly recommended.

B001L4NJIO|3.0|The audio mix on this Blu-ray disc is overly dynamic range compressed so it doesn't have any dimension to it and is quite harsh/brittle sounding at times.  With its squashed dynamic range, it was pointless to present this in 96khz/24bit audio - if they used 8 bit audio it would sound exactly the same.  But it's no wonder, the audio was mixed and mastered by Robert Orton, who calls himself the \\"hit mixer\\".  It's apparent that Robert's mixing \\"The Police\\" like he does \\"Lady Gaga\\" and \\"Enrique Iglesias\\" does not yield optimal audio fidelity.

B004ZNARH4|4.0|When this was first announced I knew I had to have it.  However, I was concerned that the packaging may be an issue.  In an attempt to avoid disc damage in transit, I decided to buy this box at my local Best Buy.  As soon as I got it home I opened the box to find the two discs in the sleeves to be fine but all four discs in the bottom of the box had come dislodged and had minor scuffs on them.  I found this to be disheartening after paying $108.99 plus 9.75% local sales tax.  I went back to by local BB and noticed all three of the remaining box sets on the shelf had loose discs rattling around inside.  Oh well, guess I'll keep them the way they are.  Fortunately none of the discs exhibit any playback issues.  I think the content is quite good with this set and I only have minor complaints:  Disc 1 - 2011 remaster - Sounds a little warmer than the 1994 release, but no differences that make me want to replace my entire PF remasters collection.  Disc 2 - live 1974 - very cool and worth while to the set.  Disc 3 - lossy 5.1 mixes - pointless if you have a Blu-ray player.  EDIT: this DVD also has the James Guthrie stereo remaster in 48khz/24bit resolution and it reveals more detail than the CD  version.  I like to listen to this when I'm not near my Blu-ray player.  Disc 4 - EPK & screen films - nice to see once, but also kinda pointless.  Disc 5 - Blu-ray disc - both Guthrie 5.1 and and Parsons 4.0 mixes are really nice, but the quad mix is the winner in the fidelity dept.  EDIT: The stereo remaster by James Guthrie appears here in 96khz/24bit resolution and it reveals much more clarity and detail than the CD.  IMO this makes the CD also kinda pointless.  Disc 6 - very cool bonus material.  The Household Objects track is killer.  I feel the price is inflated because of the physical collectibles included with this set.  Personally I would have preferred no collectibles, better disc storage, and a price more in the range of $65.  UPDATE:  I emailed EMI about my scuffed discs and they said they will be sending out replacements!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Hey all,<br /><br />I watched this movie last night through Amazon Instant on my Panasonic Blu Ray using Vierra. As usual the video and sound quality was amazing.<br /><br />The movie was very entertaining and I know it sounds strange but rather authentic. By authentic I am talking about the sets, characters, the era, etc. I do not know much about Captain America in general so I am not talking about it being authentic from that standpoint. it could be, I just do not know. It just appearred realistic to me considering the type of movie it is.<br /><br />The acting was great and the cgi was not over done. I really thought it was a fun, action packed movie though I tgend to like things a little darker. I would have loved for this movie to have been rated r but I guess you can't have everything.<br /><br />If you like this type of movie and if you liked Green Lantern you will love this. In my opinion it was much, much better than Green Lantern.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Webdevoman<br />Talk Development
B003L45JLW|5.0|I must admit, I'm not what you would call a huge Tom Petty fan.  Seeing this Blu-ray audio advertised peaked my interest however, so I bought it.  From the first track I was pleasantly surprised at both musical quality and audio fidelity.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers have released a very blues based album here, and I'm lovin' it because I'm a big blues fan (Muddy Waters is my favorite).  The audio mix provides definition for all the instruments and is both warm and clear sounding.  Some here have knocked the fact that it's presented at only 48khz/24bit resolution but when comparing to the CD release, the warmth and clarity are noticeably superior with the BD-Audio.  Personally, it sounds every bit as resolute as the 96khz/24bit audio on the \\"Damn The Torpedoes\\" BD-Audio disc.  Just my two cents.  Highly recommended for any hi rez audio lover.

1451648537|3.0|I've started to read the new Isaacson bio and have the same reaction I have to most of the coverage of how Reed College influenced him--it focuses on the counterculture stuff (which was not universal at Reed even during the 70s) and not on the intellectual rigor (which clearly influenced him as well).    It paints a very one-dimensional picture of an environment that nurtured thorough and independent thought and perfectionism.  No one at Reed ever felt smart enough.  Also, I never see it mentioned that the calligraphy class, was taught by an ex-Jesuit, Bob Palladino, who spoke extensively about buddhist philosphy and practice as we spent hours writing letters over and over again in italics.  Isaacson did not add to the public record about this period in Jobs' life and I wonder if his research in other parts of the book are as thin.
0307593312|4.0|I read this particular work in Korean and in English.  I am fluent in both languages, but this was the only time I read his work in Korean as well and that was because I simply could not wait for the US edition to come out and the 3-volume Korean version was available in the meantime.  All other fiction and nonfiction works by Murakami I have read had been translated by the same two translators of this book and I enjoyed all of them except for this one.  It's quite possible that my having read it in Korean first might have introduced a bias (Korean is my first language).  Granted Murakami's prose is known to be overly simple, I still feel that their translation seems to have rendered Murakami's prose more \\"plain\\" than how it comes across in Korean.  Just my opinion...    I would not put this in my top three Murakami novels, maybe not even top five...  But I'm still giving it four stars because it is still an excellent and enjoyable work by one of my favorite authors.    One other remark I would make is that the last pages of this book left me feeling a lot like how I felt when I finished reading Norwegian Wood (they are both love stories, Murakami-style)...    I am curious what other Japanese/Chinese/Korean readers who also read both translations thought of the English edition...

I want to know the answers for the following questions.   1) How did Jobs convince Woz to do all the tech work for him and still take a share of Woz's earnings (in 1974).  2) What really inspired him to go to India? Did that trip help him in making any important decisions later in life?  3) It is well known that Jobs is not a good programmer. How did he earn the respect of his fellow workers?  4) How did he become a millionaire in 5 years? How did he get the customers to buy all those bulky machines?   5) Was he really a shrewd man?  6) How did he get a Job in Atari without a college degree?

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It's a great app. Why are people who are having problems with Amazon giving it one star? That issue has nothing to do with the app itself.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book and I can hardly wait for the next one to come out.  I read the book so fast (because I just COULDN'T put it down), that I kept surprising myself to see that I had so much more book to read.  This book is perfect for people who like witches, mystery, romance, historical fiction, etc AND people who usually read through great books incredibly too fast. I think I may just read it again....
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|glad i didn't pay for it ... barely even opens before it closes. it's a waste of space and i'll be deleting it.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Bejeweled with a  twist! Hard to put down; works fine on my HTC Incredible 2. Glad I got it for free.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is an excellent FAOTD. I am shocked at all the negative. App is as close to the real deal as you can get for the phone.  I for one certainly appreciate this being free today.  App is working like a dream on HTC Thunderbolt... five stars!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I'm exploring self-publishing a novel, and so I thought John Locke would have some worthy ideas. Yes, the book is brief. But it's definitely worth the cost. There are some very interesting ideas, but I found the most valuable element to be a glimpse into Locke's marketing mind. He's really, really good. After reading the book I'm not surprised at his success. I wish there was a bit more of a psychological exploration about where his drive and enthusiasm come from and how other authors could tap their own drives. Locke gave me ideas, but he also guided me to think on my own and come up with some original plans.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This application works great on T mobile G2.  This is a great office application, I was able to open and edit my word documents as well as synch with Google idocs. This is a great productivity application and worth the download
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Who needs this when we have google docs? Not only is google docs free every day, be its ten times better. This dev wasted their time, and Amazon its wasting ours.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Simply put, one of the best batman movies.  With so many batman movies and shows to compare, its hard to raise above the rest.  I would put this one near Batman: The Dark Knight, but it is a different flavor considering its more based on the comics.  Its not the classic animated series joker, but he seriously does justice to the character.  It includes great one lines, especially from the joker, and touches bases with the least well known Robins.  Just an overall delight for any batman or action fan.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|The program looks great and I have only tried to load a couple of files and it wasn't able to load all of them.  One of them was an Excel file that loads fine in QuickOffice and Excel but would only load the dates and numbers but not the text.  I also had a PDF file that works fine in QuikOffice and Adobe reader buy not in OfficeSuite
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Long time fans of John Grisham will love The Litigators, which is one of his best books in years.  You can read the plot elsewhere, but suffice to say unlike some of his recent efforts, this book not only keeps you interested right to the end, but provides a satisfactory ending that doesn't leave the reader feeling short-changed. Some recent Grisham books seem to spend a lot of time setting up the characters and the plot, and then end with a whimper. This breaks the trend.  I've got every one of Grisham's books and this one ranks in the top half-dozen. There was always the feeling of \\"just one more chapter before I put it down\\" which (let's be honest) can't always be said.  For those who've fallen out of love with Grisham, maybe give this one a try before you give up all together! Highly recommended.

0385344325|5.0|When I heard that the next Reacher novel would be a prequel as opposed to the run of the mill, trouble in a small town type of story, I knew immediately that I had to read it. I've enjoyed everything Mr. Child has read so far, so I felt that this would be no different, but the idea that we would finally get to see a bit of Reacher's back story, in detail as opposed to vague allusions to an older brother, a falling out with the Army, etc., was intriguing to say the least.   After finishing the book in one sitting (not unlike many of my fellow readers, I'm sure) I had a feeling that I'd never had after reading through one Reacher's adventures. The action, the extraordinary knowledge of hand to hand combat, the evidence that Army training never leaves a person no matter where they are, and the breathtaking suspense that made this book impossible to put down, these were all there, and in massive quantity, but this didn't seem to be the Reacher that we were all used to. I wanted to chalk it up to character development, the fact that the plot literally takes place years before any of us knew who Jack Reacher was, let alone how cool he is and how much every red-blooded American male wants to be him. Then I put my finger on it. In Reacher's long literary history, this is the first time we've seen him vulnerable. The first time we've seen him look past the \\"facts\\" of a case in favor of personal interest. I won't go into too much detail in order to preserve the story for those of you that haven't read it, but suffice it to say that we're not talking vulnerable in terms of combat or strategy...it's another vulnerability altogether. And in the end, as always, Reacher's gut instinct proves to be right. I applaud Mr. Child for allowing us to see this aspect of his character. Without a doubt the best series character in literature today, created by one of best writers in the genre. If you haven't read any of Mr. Child's work, the first suggestion is to move out of your cave. The second is to find yourself a copy of this book and immerse yourself in the world of Jack Reacher.
1594744769|5.0|This is a wonderfully creepy book!  Jacob's grandfather had shown him photographs of the peculiar children that he lived with in a children's home during WWII.  He told Jacob that the children had unusual abilities - such as the ability to levitate or be invisible, and that they had lived on a beautiful island protected by a hawk who smoked a pipe.  When Jacob grew older, he no longer believed his grandfather's stories about the peculiar children and the horrible monsters that were after him.  Until, when he was 16 years old, his grandfather died and Jacob saw the monster who killed him.      After going through therapy, and after finding a mysterious letter that had belonged to his grandfather, and with the encouragement of his therapist, Jacob goes to the island off of Wales where his grandfather had lived in the children's home.  His father goes with him to observe and write about the birds that live on the island.  There, Jacob learns who and what he is, travels in time and fights the monsters as well.      This story is illustrated with authentic vintage photographs, which is an unusual and fascinating way to write a story.  The story is a fantasy with mystery, suspense and intrigue.    I totally enjoyed it, and highly recommend it.
0062060554|3.0|If you haven't seen the movie \\"Memento\\", I suppose this would be a 5-star book.  If you have seen the movie, then you'll find yourself saying \\"Hey, something like that happened in Memento\\" every couple pages, so 3-stars.  Even so, the story takes some interesting twists and turns and I found myself staying up later than expected to see how it ends.   And if you haven't seen \\"Memento\\" and you've read this book, then by all means check it out.  It's an excellent movie!  And you can watch the movie and say \\"Hey, something like that happened in Before I Go To Sleep\\" every couple minutes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a great way to keep up with your Kindle books since the program offers very stable performance.  I don't always carry my Kindle with me and when I find time on my hands I can just open my android and continue where I left off with my story.
0071636080|1.0|This book is not completely vacuous. It has the substance of a 10-page article spread over 238 pages.  It is supposed to be on presentations but is in fact only on sales pitches. The techniques presented are applicable if you are selling, for example, a new computer operating system, but what if you have to train programmers on developing applications for it? Tag lines, celebrity guests, and three-minute demos won't do it, no matter how much you practice. You have to dive into technical details over days, not minutes. It is a different challenge, and not addressed in this book.<br /><br />What happens when an author stretches an article to book length? The reader wastes time reading unnecessary words. The book is full of redundancies, as he same keynote speeches are quoted multiple times. Explanations are long-winded, with captions like , \\"Slows down rate of speech\\" instead of just \\"Slows down.\\" You have long quotations from other books, like an entire page from Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers on pp. 182-183. And you have material that the editor should have cut. Most Americans learn the difference between a metaphor and an analogy in 5th grade. You don't need to explain it in a book about Steve Jobs, but if you choose to, you better get it right. Gallo has it backwards: his example of an analogy, \\"the microprocessor is the brain of your computer,\\" on p. 8, is actually a metaphor, and vice versa.  As an example of his \\"rule of three,\\" he cites \\"The three musketeers,\\" which is a strange choice to anyone who has read it or seen any movie adaptation of it.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|While most everyone knows that the first Badlands release is indeed a classic, few have heard the next 2 releases Voodo Highway and Dusk. While Voodo Highway to my pleasure reverted to sounding very 70 ish and didnt no where near follow the popularity of the first that is I think untill now, Dusk is a whole new animal. While Badlands was on its way out due to Rays illness and reported conflict within the band they somehow put together Dusk. Dusk is full of big rock sound and I have to say reminds me at times of Trapeze. One thing for sure Ray Gillen gave it all in voice and lyrics while Jake E. Lee was tearing up some serious guitar. Now that I have all 3 Badlands I can say that I love them all for each ones individuality. I believe that each in its own way is indeed a classic for their form. I think they call that talented progression. So instead of downing Badlands for not following up their debut with just more of the same I give them tons of credit for breaking the mold and going down a different path that in my opinion lead to 2 albums that very much need to be explored and heard for the classics that they are. If you love rock n roll you have to have Voodo and Dusk ! Ray and Jake laid out some fantastic tunes that I think if played on todays radio would blow people away !
B004EPZ084|2.0|It has a few moments. As the New Yorker said (roughly), it's sounds good when described, but it does not work well, a lot of funny ideas wasted. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he is in, but he's just being the same mean guy he often is. I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a \\"stud\\" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four. Overall, the plot is obvious, the comedy is clunky, we don't get to know any of the characters at all (well, maybe Kevin Spacey's the most).
1401201911|4.0|This is a book that is inventive enough, and good enough, that it makes me ask more from it than I would a normal book.  Wonderful reimagining of the Superman story. It seems so obvious, but it takes a special genius to actually generate this idea. Superman lands in the Soviet Union instead of the United States. Brilliant concept. I've never cared for Superman, he's not that interesting of a superhero to me. Yet this context makes him far more intriguing.  Generally, the art is quite good. It does vary some. Other heroes make appearances, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern are handled well. The coolest thing is the inclusion of \\"Batman\\". The Russian Batmen have the perfect costume for their role. Great translation of the American batman into the context of this story.  The one letdown, and perhaps it isn't even a fair criticism given how much the book achieved, is I feel the story could have gone one step further down the subversive road. I think there was another level of satire that might have been achieved. Maybe it's how things wrapped up that just felt a little too standard for this type of effort, though they certainly put an interesting twist on the end. Personally, I feel it would have been stronger without the twist, though many people will certainly like it.  This is a really unique book and I definitely recommend it, particularly to people who may not be pure comic book or Superman fans. There is enough interest in the story for anyone with basic familiarity with Superman to enjoy. Perhaps it is missing that one tiny element that lifts it to true greatness, but that is a a request for perfection rather than an insult to this tremendous effort.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|A total surprise. Out of 25ish episodes a season, there are maybe two OK ones, 20 great ones, and three amazing ones.  There are no weak characters in the ensemble, but the actress who plays Britta is by far the least talented, and occasionally makes me cringe with her obvious acting. Because of this, her character is the roughest sketch and does not always ring true. Had the actress who plays Annie been cast as Britta, her character would have surely been up with the rest. There have been a few bad arcs with Pierce going on a dark and mean streak that just is not funny or fun (Chevy Chase's acting is never the issue). But the rest of the show and cast is so strong, I happily sit through a few bad moments for one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. My favorite line so far is \\"slurred speech\\". The first season's paintball episode was a revelation, where the second season's two-parter was merely great.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was looking for the ability to create/edit Microsoft documents on my phone, and this app was just what I was looking for. Compared to other useless &quot;free app of the day&quot; apps, this is an app worth keeping. Thanks Amazon!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|was going to purchase for 15$, found its free today! Outside of the minor issue of defaulting to the alpha instead of the numeric keyboard in spreadsheet, it works flawlessly on my Dinc. Will work well for the times when I'm not at my desktop for lightweight calculations. I haven't tried the wp yet, but if its anywhere near as functional as the spdsheet, terrific! Most definitely 5-STAR or more.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|First thing first it's free so that's $15 I saved. Second this is so much better then the default QuickOffice. I have no issue editing documents it's so fluid with no headaches.

B0054N73EY|4.0|I´m one of those people who thought the Red hot chili peppers, would not make another good record without John frusciante. Well, guess i was wrong..  In fact, \\"Im with you\\" is much better than i expected, and at this moment, its a real candidate to my favorite record of the year.  The new guitarrist, Josh Klinghoffer, brough fresh blood to the band, which is a good thing. The funk is here, just like those sunny pop gems and soft ballads, the chili had made in the last 10years. It may not have those super-singles songs like \\"Californication\\", \\"By the Way\\" or \\"Snow\\", but as a whole, i think its their most consistent album to date.  Best Songs: \\"Did i let you know\\", \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" and \\"Police Station\\".  My Rate: 3 and a half stars, BUT very, very close to the 4 stars.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Unbelievable. I could not put The Hunger Games down!  I am 40+ years old and was completely captivated by this book!  The book was recommended to me, and now I have to go back for the rest of the trilogy.  A little SciFi mixed with adventure, conspiracy (which I hope to see how it turns out in the other books), fighting like gladiators, and a little romance.  You will love this book.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I have used This app for a long time. I have tried others and keep coming back to it. I use it on both my Android Phone (Galaxy S5) and my tablet (Asus TF300). The latest update (3.2.3163) brings a great new Material Design user interface, and The ability to bookmark favorite folders and files (ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN A VERY USEFULE FEATURE). My only issue is this, I am a big user of cloud based file storage (Box, Google, etc). which OfficeSuite supports very well, and is one of the biggest reasons I use it. This last update for some reason broke/removed cloud access, but only for my SMARTPHONE. On my tablet it works as well as ever, and the bookmark feature makes it even easier to get to oft-used docs.  Mobisystems, Please tell me wheter this is a bug or if the feature really is &#34;Not yet supported&#34; as the error message says when I try to re-add my cloud accounts on my S5??   If it is for some reason not implmented on smartphones, or if it is a bug PLEASE FIX SOON.

The upgrade to Swiftkey X this year was more than worth it. It's still great at predicting text and has a few new options like customizations and themes. It was worth every penny when I first paid for it.

B004SBULWE|2.0|I remember when I first got my HTC Evo 4G with Android 2.1 (Eclair) onboard, I used this app to help manage tasks. After the update to 2.2 (Froyo), I discovered that this app was essentially worthless because Android already has internal task management from that point on.   It gets two stars instead of one because I can see people stuck with older phones finding this useful. If you're with the times and have any form of Android above 2.1, avoid this, because you won't be needing it. The most you'll get from this app on a modern phone is a placebo effect.

0446547654|5.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and absolutely LOVED this book. As usual, he crafted a fabulous love story that kept me guessing until the very last page. It was not predictable, as another reader stated it was. At times, it was a little unrealistic, but it's fiction and I've come to understand that. All in all, it was a great read! It took me less than 2 days to finish it. I recommend this book, without reservations, to all readers!

1439192812|4.0|Thanks to Richard Dawkins, I no longer confused incubus with succubus. They are night demons that paralyse you when you're asleep, in order to have sex with you -- incubus with females and succubus with males. (Succubus are supposed to be very beautiful but most horny males won't have any luck meeting them, sorry, this isn't part of the book text!)<br /><br />Too bad, sexy night demons don't exist; your sense of being paralysed in your sleep is caused by sleep paralysis, says Dawkins. He also explains alien abductions are most likely caused by false memories. People's descriptions of what the aliens look like and the experiements performed, usually followed closely what appeared on television.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a book on basic science facts covering everything that can be explained by a well-articulated science teacher, but written in Dawkins's lucid, conversational style.<br /><br />So, if you've forgotten your biology, physics and chemistry stuff that you learnt in secondary school, this book is a handy volume to refresh your knowledge.<br /><br />I give it four stars simply because I dislike untidy caricature drawings that seem to dominate every page. These illustrations look goofy and do not convey the sense of drama that Dawkins tries hard to depict.<br /><br />Caricatures are more suited to books on messy politics or economics.<br /><br />Anyway enjoy the three pictures I've selected which don't look that messy. Note that the page numbers followed the UK edition which has a different cover picture from what is shown in this Amazon offering.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Please stop rating this app 1 star for the purchasing bug.  That is an Amazon bug and not the fault of the app.  Also, for those complaining about the permissions, they are legit.  Go to an Android developer site and read about them.  They are all needed to make this app do what it says it does.  For example, they need your account info so that you can sign in to Google docs.  I agree the developer should explain them better, but they are not intended to invade your privacy.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|5 out of 5 stars!!!! THIS WAS A WONDERFUL NOVEL!! The author put together a story full of romance, friendship, and the links some would go to just so they could be a part of the person they love's life. Abby is an intriguing character who had a great back-story, and the author took that story into turns that I never expected. But I absolutely LOVED the friendship and respect that Travis and Abby shared for each other, no matter what happened between them, they were there for each other no matter what. Travis is a strong Alpha male! That made me wish I had someone who worshiped me as much as he did Abby. Okay maybe not exactly as much ... since he was a little overbearing at times but other than that he was just about the perfect guy! *sigh*<br /><br />In addition, the secondary characters from Travis' family/relatives to America to Travis and Shepley's fraternity brothers made this whole novel an addiction that I could not get enough of!<br /><br />Reviewed By: From Me to You ...

B0057R5XRG|1.0|As a Jurassic Park fan, I couldn't wait for the blu-ray release of these films. What a disappointment! I have over 200 blu-rays, and this is the worst transfer I have ever seen.  The picture is incredibly grainy, worse than my old DVD's of the films.  Universal should be ashamed at the lack of effort that went into this blu-ray release.  I have much older blu-rays from them, including \\"The Blues Brothers\\" (1980), that look fantastic, but this one looks like a vhs transfer that has been played 100 times. Absolutely terrible.
142313866X|5.0|First of all, if you don't already own the other three books so far in the Archive Series (Story, Animation, and Design), WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???  This is by far the best art book series Disney has released yet, and it demonstrates a commitment to displaying the true (often unsung) artistry of the Disney animated films, without the excessive self-congratulatory commentary of many of the recent Pixar art books.<br /><br />While the other books in the series have beautiful art as well, what makes Layout and Background a real gem is how much of the work collected here really is never-before-seen.  If you own a few other Disney art books, odds are you've seen concepts from The Lion King, or animation drawings from Beauty and the Beast, but you've probably never seen background art from the Pluto short films.  In fact, the layouts from the many short films (Mickey, Goofy, Silly Symphonies, the Disneyland TV show segments) are the big surprise of this book: the level of craftsmanship is shocking, easily just as impressive as in any of the feature films, and often spanning a greater range of styles.<br /><br />The only small complaint I have about this book is that, compared to the 2D films, the editors really seem to have phoned it in on the background samples from the 3D films: instead of showing the layout art that went into creating the detailed 3D environments, they just show final renders, and not even the best ones, at that.  There's a full-page image from Bolt that I almost wanted to rip out of the book (and I liked that movie!).  So, note: if you're looking for background art from the 3D films, you're going to need to pick up the art book for each respective movie.  Otherwise, this is a magnificent addition to any artist's collection, and a great coffee-table book for the everyday Disney fan!
B005J4TLN4|3.0|Lots of hype surrounding this movie, and after watching it last night I can see why. While it does have elements of The Warriors and Escape From New York, Attack the Block is fresh and exciting pitting street kid thugs (and one woman) against an alien invasion of some very nasty, blacker than night, with glowing massive teeth that will rip you to shreds - Aliens. The acting by a bunch of new kid actors was very believable. The aliens are done very well and intertwined in a solid action movie.  On the flip side...  I read the other day, discussions are on the way of how to remake this in America. Yesterday my reaction was of 'huh?', today I understand. Despite the skill, the story and it is a phenomenal alien movie, it suffers horribly, not only from a heavy English accent, but conversations that mostly consist of slang, and English slang at that. I literally missed the first 10 minutes of dialog, because I could not understand anything they were saying.  I then turned on subtitles (groan). But at least I now could read what I was hearing. But even with that, so much of the dialog was very specific to the English slang, and I was guessing at best what they were meaning. This really counters the otherwise excellent picture.  I can totally see them doing it over for the American audience. I just hope they focus on the magic that made this film, with excellent characters, street kid scenario, and attention to detail with tension, photography and light.   I give this only 3 stars, but if the dialog wasn't such a hindrance, the rating would be much higher

0007331789|4.0|It is close to 900 AD, and King Alfred of Wessex is dying after reigning for over 28 years. The Danes, who rule much of what will later be England, are waiting eagerly to tear apart King Alfred's Christian kingdom. Uhtred of Bebbanburg returns to the south at King Alfred's request and is asked to negotiate a treaty with King Eohric of East Anglia.<br /><br />`Every day is ordinary, I thought, until it gets interesting.'<br /><br />Uhtred has grown to admire Alfred, albeit grudgingly at times, but does not feel the same respect for Alfred's heir, the ætheling Edward. Uhtred knows that Edward mistrusts him and he also knows that battles will need to be fought if the country is to be united. The Danes are not the only enemies: there is also a rival claimant for the throne.<br /><br />`.., but victory does not come to men who listen to their fears.'<br /><br />We see a number of different aspects of Uhtred in this novel: the tenderness he feels for King Alfred's daughter Æthelflaed; his delight in annoying the priests who believe that prayer is the path to victory; and his capacity for strategic planning for the battles he knows must be fought. Uhtred may be battle ready and cynical about the role of Christianity but his encounter with a mysterious pagan witch still leaves him shaken.<br /><br />Uhtred of Bebbanburg is larger than life and while he dominates the story, it fits within what we know of the history. In this blending of history and fiction, Bernard Cornwell brings this period to life. There are reminders that while Alfred's kingdom is becoming increasingly Christian, there are many who still believe in the old gods. The use of the old place names makes the setting seem more authentic - even though I had to keep turning back to check them against the current place names.<br /><br />`I sometimes lie awake in the long nights of old age and I think of the mad things I have done, the risks, the dice throws that challenge the gods.'<br /><br />This is the sixth instalment in The Saxon Stories, and Uhtred is now in his mid-forties. I'm looking forward to the next instalment.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-SmithI'm looking forward to the next instalment.  Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I visited London last year. I actually stayed around this area in South London. It's pretty accurate as far as I can tell. It's a pretty rough city. I thought the movie and the writing was amazing. There are spots where the dialogue is hard to understand, unless you watch a lot of British movies. The action scenes were surprisingly well-choreographed and filmed. The story was lacking, but accomplished the job that the director sought to do. It honestly is more a character film, much like Guy Ritchie's movies were before he lost touch with his roots. I could see how some might not like this movie, particularly Americans. If you're open-minded to a decent movie, give this a watch.
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|I was a huge fan of the first one... it feels like the graphics are way over done in the second, which slows down the loading time, and does not contribute to game play... I have only made it through the first level, but I wish they had kept the graphics more simple... that said, I am a sucker for &quot;bejeweled&quot; type of games, and will play through the next level before I give up on this app altogether.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Most people looking through these review I'm sure will be most interested in the sound quality of the remastered material. I am an audiophile in every sense of the word, and anybody who says 'it's not that much different from the prior cd releases' needs to clean out their ears. The sound quality of these cd is SUPERB beyond belief, amazing. Completely surpasssed my wildest expectations with this. It's rich and full, not over done but rather, sounds as timeless as the music itself. If you knew nothing of the Smiths and played a song in 2011, you would most likely think it came from 2011. That is priceless. So, is it worth the purchase for the immaculate sound upgrade?...yes. 100%.

0307474712|5.0|A one sentence synopsis for \\"One Day\\" by David Nichols might go something like this: Girl meets boy following college graduation, a friendship kindles, and they stay in touch for the next 20 years.<br /><br />It's that simple, and yet so much more.<br /><br />Emma and Dexter begin as two, fairly typical twenty-something's trying their hardest to avoid the traps of conventional living. Emma is by far the level-headed one of the pair while Dexter is a hedonistic loose cannon. Emma's life takes unfortunate twists mostly due to circumstances beyond her control. Dexter's pain is almost entirely his own doing. Still, Dexter has a love and respect for Emma (most of the time) that grounds him.<br /><br />When I first picked up this book I read one chapter and then put it away for several months. The beginning was slow and I was weary of what might turn out to be an overly indulgent novel. When I picked up the book again I discovered I didn't give the tone enough of a chance. The dialogue is witty and true. The relationships are believable even though they're forever mired in the bad choices of flawed people. Dexter is often a selfish jerk to everyone in his life and not just Emma, and his actions might turn readers off to this story. Several times I hoped Emma would say \\"I've had enough\\" and simply walk away forever. Her one great flaw might be she gives Dexter too many chances. Though I would argue it's because of Emma's strength that makes this story extraordinary.

B001M2CBRK|3.0|I was not impressed with this movie at the theaters, but that was probably because the previews looked really good. I watched Jarhead again on DVD and thought it was much better with the deleted scenes. Some of them really give you a better understanding of the complexity of the characters and where there are coming from.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I found this book to be a very fantastic read and really enjoyed the story, the characters, and the excitement of it all. This book added to the story line and helps peak the interest of the reader. Reading the books of the Pretty Little Liars series was more enjoyable then watching the tv series. The books flowed really nicely and showed how the story should truly be told unlike the tv series. Highly recommend to all...

0553807919|5.0|If you are a parent, teacher or other person who works with children, I would commend this book to you. By understanding how the brain works, you can survive tough moments and teach children to thrive. The Whole-Brain Child explains both how and why.<br /><br />The twelve strategies the book explains are:<br />Connect then Redirect<br />Name It To Tame It<br />Engage, Don't Enrage<br />Use It Or Lose It<br />Move It Or Lose It<br />Use The Remote Of The Mind<br />Remember To Remember<br />Let The Clouds of Emotion Roll By<br />SIFT: sensation, image, feeling, and thought<br />Exercise Mindsight<br />Increase The Family Fun Factor<br />Connect Through Conflict<br /><br />Each strategy is explained both scientifically and practically. There are examples and a particularly helpful appendix chart that give examples of how to use these strategies with various ages. The book also includes cartoons to share these concepts with your kids. This isn't voodoo science you use on your children to control them, these are strategies you share with them so they can have greater control over their own emotions.<br /><br />I think this book provides tools any parent can use with their children. I have already recommended it many times.

B005NJ2K6U|3.0|I really like this game, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really care for match 3 games. I dislike Bejeweled with a passion, so I found it interesting that I found this game so addicting. The combination of gameplay elements, graphics, and sounds are really pleasing, and I found myself wanting to play more and more throughout the day. However...  I'm not sure what it is with the match 3 games I've downloaded lately. This is the 2nd one I've played on my SGS2 that eats the battery like crazy, the first being Tropical Fish Shop. I've played other games that are much more graphically-intensive, yet they only use a fraction of the power. In fact, my phone gets very abnormally hot to the touch, and the game becomes the top power consumer in just a few rounds. Because of this, it's very likely I wont be playing this unless I'm near an outlet, to which case what's the point of even having this game on my phone? I get games for my phone to let me pass the time in idle situations, but if I can't do that it really reduces my interest in playing the game. Using a high end phone, I would expect this game to run more smoothly than your typical budget phone, which is why the power usage surprises me.  Great game, but as of this review I can't give it more than 3 stars because of the power problem; I can't play it on-the-go for fear the game will reduce my phone's capability to be a phone.
0316056863|3.0|Some other reviewers have stated it already, but I'll add to their voices, that while there is quite a bit of humor contained in this book there is a missing element of cohesion. Not quite a memoir, not quite a reflection on sexism, not quite a comment on motherhood, not quite a full presentation of her SNL and 30 Rock experiences. It's a bit of everything. Unfortunately, the switch from each of those topics is abrupt and lacking a common narrative to tie things together. I'd love to read some straight fiction from Tina once she has the time to write something again.

B0057R5XRG|1.0|How they could even dare call this set \\"digitally re-mastered\\".  The Blu Ray transferer on \\"Jurassic Park\\" was just plain terrible, I think my DVD actual looks better.  The image was so soft and grainy I truly don't understand what they were thinking.  \\"The Lost World\\" was the best transfer of the 3 by far with \\"Jurassic Park III\\" (while although also grainy) was a distant 2nd but was no where near as bad as the original.  I feel I wasted $50 on a set I was looking so forward to.  Lesson learned, I will wait for reviews before buying other major sets.  Don't tell me it was because it was an older movie either.  As Universal did a great job with the \\"Back to the Future\\" trilogy and did you see the Star Wars (1977) \\"New Hope\\" Blu Ray version?  No excuses on this set, Universal dropped the ball on this much awaited Blu Ray. My advice is to skip it and save some money as well as the disappointment.<br /><br />AMAZON, you need to start separating your reviews into categories.  Stop mixing DVD reviews with the Blu Ray.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This concert was a wonderful representation of Les Miserables.  I first fell in love with this musical, and musical theater, when I saw a school production of the show some 6 years ago.  The flaws in this show were that certain scenes were cut and replaced with a filmed sequence.  This would leave first time watchers a bit confused as they could not piece together what happened.  Also I felt that the death exits could have been done better than people just walking off stage.  Otherwise the casting was impeccable.  I just wish that they had made a cd for the concert because I would have loved to have heard the songs over and over on my ipod without having to view videos on youtube.  Please let me know if you find a cd for the concert.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby back in the 1940's.  This was one creation that didn't involve Stan Lee.  Stan was responsible for the Captain's revival back in the mid- 1960's.  Ironically, a  1990 feature film version of the Captain prominently displayed Lee as the creator.<br /><br />Captain America was one of the first to show the element of genetic engineering or \\"super serum\\".  The movie shows character actor Stanley Tucci as the German scientist who recruits Steve (Chris Evans) Rodgers for his experiment. The scientist wants a humble man who \\"knows the value of strength\\".  He wants a man who knows failure and weakness. He doesn't want an ego maniac who could turn into another Adolph.<br /><br />On the other side of the globe, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)is preparing an attack on the U.S.A. and overthrowing Hitler.  The Cosmic Cube, which is a device in Stan Lee's 1960's Captain America revival, holds the key to his power.<br /><br />The movie places all it's elements together at a fast pace. We even get to see Bucky, Cap's partner. Although in this version he doesn't have the costume.  The Howling Commandos make their appearance.  Sans Nick Fury in this movie, because he's alive in the 21st  Century.  Neal  McDonough has a few moments as the ever popular \\"Dum, Dum Doogan, Fury's burly and  mustached right hand man. If you're a fan of the comics; you are in for a special treat.<br /><br />That's the advantage of Marvel producing this film. I would have to say out of all the super hero movies this summer, this is the best of them all. You won't be disappointed if you're a die hard fan like myself.  The directors commentary provides lots of unknown information on how the film was made. You get to hear the director, Joe Johnston  talk about how the movie was developed from the ground up.  This has to be the most plausible version of the character I have seen.<br /><br />There were four attempts to bring the Captain to the screen. In the 1940's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown. That version brought him into modern times. However the script was very slow to develop.  The 1990 feature film starred Matt Salinger  son of the famous author) as Captain America.  It also featured Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox in supporting roles.  That too was also painfully slow to watch.  What the current producers see was the fact that fans want to see action on the screen. Not two hours of talking heads.40's there was a mediocre movie serial, that didn't follow the  Captain's mythology. In 1979 there were two TV movies with actor Reb Brown.

B004EPZ00W|5.0|They say that few things are as American as baseball. Maybe apple pie, but even that is a close decision. But in the early 2000s, and even today, that meant one thing: to succeed in America at baseball all you needed was the biggest bank account. The Red Sox and Yankees, and to some extent the entire East Coast, had budgets that dwarfed other ball clubs.  It had gotten to the point that under that system teams like the Oakland A's became nothing but farm teams for teams with the bigger payrolls to cherry-pick from come free-agency. Billy Beane, who remains the GM for the A's, and his assistant Paul DePodesta fought against the system, and revolutionized the way baseball is scouted today.  Moneyball, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of this revolution and the men who bucked the system.      Billy Beane was a five-star draftee (23rd overall pick by the Mets in 1980) who didn't pan out for the organization. Despite millions of dollars a year invested in scouting, Beane's case was not uncommon. Players hyped as future Hall of Famers routinely underperform in the Big Show, if they make it at all. Furthermore the only explanation scouts can point to for valuing one recruit higher than another, other than batting average or total runs batted in, was \\"instinct\\". But after the Beane-DePodesta revolution, as Beane has put it: \\"It's all about evaluating skills and putting a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k  a retirement savings account) has a choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which way I'd choose.\\"  What really makes this movie exceptional isn't that unique take on baseball, the direction, or even the acting, although both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are brilliant in their respective roles, it is the writing. Moneyball, the movie and book, both shine in their juxtaposition of Beane's life with his career and his beloved A's and their revolution that forever altered baseball.  Brad Pitt plays Beane perfectly, from the public swagger of a former ball player to the despair and somberness in his private moments. Some of the most memorable scenes in this film are scenes that have nothing to do with baseball. And for anyone who has ever been around baseball knows, the moments in this movie that are laugh out loud hilarious are exactly how humor on the diamond has always been: random, a little weird, but perfect in the moment.    This movie's failings, and truly there aren't many, exist in its pacing. At times it feels like the movie is roaring along, trying to fit Mr. Lewis' entire book into but two hours, and at others we are crawling along like a major league club in early July. If you love baseball, you may not even notice (I didn't notice the pacing until a friend of mine, a strictly football guy, mentioned it after), but if not it can seem tedious at times.      The film itself could easily stand alone, but for any true blue baseball fan this movie is destined to become required viewing. For anyone interested in what those mad scientists in Oakland were doing in '03, or the system that almost every major league club has now embraced, this movie is for you.
B0042L78MG|5.0|I heard \\"Back it Up\\" on a local college radio station, and I was entranced.  I ordered the CD, the shipper cancelled, I reordered with another...it's a pain that she doesn't have a distributor in the US, but when I finaly got it (3 weeks after the initial order), I found that it was totally worth the wait.  I can't believe she hasn't gotten airplay in the US!  She is so different than anything I hear on commercial radio, but in such a great way.

0062011847|4.0|Roger Zelazny is my all-time favorite writer. But Terry Pratchett is knocking at the door, causing a ruckus. And I marvel at the man's persistence in producing quality stuff even after 38 novels set in the Discworld. After nearly three decades, he's still tipping over those sacred cows, still pointing a finger at those shifty establishments. Here's SNUFF now, the 39th one. SNUFF casts as its central character the fabulous Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (who is also the reluctant Duke of Ankh). Sam Vimes is one of my favorites.<br /><br />After a history of fierce, steadfast service, it's come to this for Sam Vimes: a two-week bucolic holiday at his wife's country home. Kicking and screaming and forced to temporarily turn in his badge, Vimes actively dreads his vacation, dreads leaving Ankh-Morpork and its stench and depravity and all-around city-ness. And for what? For the soul-sucking ennui of the countryside... where crime is more scarce than people who don't use apostrophes at the end of words? But Lady Sybil will have her way. And it's not as if Lord Vetinari, Ankh-Morpork's manipulative Patrician, had anything to do with this, oh no...<br /><br />Except that a policeman will dig up wrongdoing anywhere, if only he looked hard enough. As Vimes remarks to Sgt. Littlebottom: \\"Where there are policemen there's crime, sergeant, remember that.\\" (To which the sergeant respectfully replies: \\"Yes, I do, sir, although I think it sounds better with a little reordering of the words.\\") In his wife's clean-aired, open-skied shire, Sam Vimes stumbles onto grievous malfeasance, at which point you can picture Sam Vimes big grinning.<br /><br />Vimes' sleuthing nose leads him into prying into the local gentry's business, and as we've witnessed time and again in those cosies, wickedness runs rampant in pastoral environs. Vime's poking and prodding unearth a smuggling ring and the, if not illegal, at least immoral trafficking of goblins. There's even a murder or two. There's even wholesale slaughter or two. Good thing, then, that Commander Vimes sort of accidentally on purpose neglected to turn in his badge.<br /><br />As ever Terry Pratchett launches his salvo of clever metaphors and satiric observations, and the themes in SNUFF are in your face enough that there's no need to delve into them too much. We note the goblins, smelly and annoying and universally regarded as vermin, and so what if a goblin girl is killed for sport and her fellow goblins are trundled off and shoved on a barge to be stacked like kindling? On Discworld, goblins are not classified as human beings. But we know Pratchett's about to turn this perception topsy-turvy. It gradually sinks in that there's more to goblins than just chicken stealing. Goblins observe the practice of \\"Unggue\\" which dictates that they collect various bodily excretions and store them in finely crafted pots (which they themselves make). These containers, ironically, are highly coveted by those classified as \\"human beings.\\"<br /><br />More a Sam Vimes story, we still get cameo glimpses of the rest of the City Watch, with Wee Mad Arthur, the urban Nac Mac Feegle copper, being showcased delightfully. In Ankh-Morpork Sgt. Fred Colon is stricken with a mysterious malady, and perhaps that exquisite goblin pot he won't let go has something to do with it. Fred's plight eventually dovetails into Vimes' story.<br /><br />The first half of SNUFF is paced deliberately, Pratchett focusing on Vimes' fish out of water reactions in the country. But when Vimes catches the scent, the pace picks up and rapidly generates momentum. Along the way, Vimes takes the local village constable under his wing, tries not to question his suddenly shady butler, Willikins, too much (and just when did Willikins become street savvy?), and tries to keep up with his son Young Sam's poo collecting. He also tries to sneak in a bacon sandwich or two.<br /><br />It's nice that Lady Sybil has a great presence in this story, and Pratchett illustrates why Vimes is so besotted with her. It's nice to catch up to Young Sam, although I personally could've done without all the poo stuff. SNUFF is not Pratchett's best work. It's certainly not the best City Watch story I've read, and the narrative isn't as tight. But because this is a master storyteller spinning his yarn, I still couldn't tear away from the pages. Pratchett's humor and wisdom and sheer writing talent and the premise of Vimes on a busman's holiday easily overcome the lack and the lag. What makes his novels work is that he peoples them with rich - in Vimes' case, reluctantly rich - and utterly compelling characters, which then has the consequence of making his skewering of conventions all the more telling. I love the mad footnotes, the forays into non-sequiturs, the sheer breadth of detail he imposes on the narrative. Listen, I even ate up the series of epilogues that were so seemingly unending, even the LotR: RETURN OF THE KING movie was heard to remark, \\"Geez, just end it already.\\"nd Pratchett illustrates why Vimes is so besotted with her.

It seems obvious that we should test our products with real people, discover the actions responsible for our successes and failures, and make it as easy as possible to update our products frequently.  In practice, few entrepreneurs actually do.  The Lean Startup is a wake up call for any entrepreneur that has struggled to find success and a beacon for those about to start their journey.  Eric provides plenty of first hand accounts of business that found success through rapid, experimentation-driven iteration as well as those that lost their way by assuming that they were headed down the right path.  If you're wondering what Lean Startups are all about, you should buy this book right now.  You'll understand the characteristics that define a Lean Startup and why they are the future of business.  If you're already familiar with Lean Startup, you'll still discover new perspectives through the case studies that aren't available anywhere else.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Despite the supposed 40 interviews with Job's and his closest associates, I don't really feel like much was revealed.  I expected to hear more personal details from Steve.  The book struggles to personally discover Jobs.  It tries to at the beginning, when analyzing that Job's struggle in life was to reconcile being abandoned by his biological parents.  It doesn't really continue this theme or develop any new ones as the story continues.<br /><br />That said it is an easy and fast read.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Okay so I am a relatively new Coldplay fan (starting listening and following them about 6 years ago) but I've just read through a few of these negative reviews and I just had to review one of my own.  Seriously, people? I think if you are a true fan, and appreciate their efforts, that you should listen to the album at least 3 times before giving it a poor rating. I have to listen to any album a few times until I can honestly say I do/do not like it. As a fan, you at least owe them that for their years worth of effort and work put into this album. If you don't like it after that, then its okay to rate it low.  I consider myself a COLDPLAY fan, and anything they dish out I usually love. So can you honestly say you love Coldplay?

B0049D1TCM|5.0|Nicki Minaj Raps and sings, \\"wow\\" that's the way Hip Hop Vocalist should do music and take popular urban dance music to the next level of entertainment. Another up and coming American artist I just listen to on Amazon name [[ASIN:B005Q0FO1Y Stryk]], he performs the entire CD with street beats, R&B, SOUL , Blues and Rap vocals on the [[ASIN:B005Q0FO1Y Thorough]] Album.  Just like Nicki Minaj and [[ASIN:B002LVAZO2 Drake]] he Raps and sings.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Purchased this item as my car doesn't have a jack to plug an iPod or other player into. I saw this and thought it was a cool solution to this problem. I had tried a cheaper version of this kind of player that I found at WalMart, but that one didn't have fast forward/rewind, and the signal would get interference from local & distant FM stations. The Soundfly corrects these issues, and I have been very happy with it. The menus are decently arranged and the display is pretty easy to read for it's size. Just pop in an SD card and you're good to go. A great bonus feature  is that it displays the song title and artist on my car's FM radio readout - very cool item.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is hands-down the best game I have on my phone, and probably the best game I have seen for any mobile device period. It is extremely unique and although easy to jump right into is quite challenging. As many people have said, it is beautifully designed. And even after beating the whole thing it is still fun to go back and replay it. i cannot recommend it enough.
1451648537|5.0|This was an insanely well-written biography for Steve Jobs that covered everything from the history of his adoptive parents, his early days at school to the eventual success he had with the companies he built. Walter Isaacson did a great job to recreate the past events and more importantly the emotions and struggles of the person - Steve Jobs.  I was extremely impressed with the detail and the openness that Steve gave to Isaacson, knowing he was an extremely private person. However, as the cancer complications became fatal, I guess Steve wanted to passed on his true legacy to his kids and the rest of the world. He was no longer the private and maybe a bit selfish person he once was.  In addition to the stories, there were never before seen photos of his family; interviews from his friends, former colleagues and even enemies. What surprised me the most was the never before told flaws of the great person we all came to love. Steve was perhaps the worst manager to work for.  More here - frankleng.me/?p=626

B003L77GGK|3.0|Season 6 in my opinion was the worst season so far.  Firstly, it is obvious that Sera Gamble is no Erik Kripke. The Ben/Lisa/Dean story line was ridiculous. It was drawn out and unnessecary. (I'm not a Dean/Lisa fan, there was NO chemisty between the actors). Besides, whenever Lisa was involved, Dean was not the loveable hunter we all know and love. And it felt like Dean was more of a supporting character to Sam and Castiel. Then there was \\"Souless Sam\\". Does every season have to involve some Evil!Sammy? We went through five seasons with this, can we have a little change? Though it was sad, Cas going darkside was the strongest plot.  There was some good points though. 6x05 where there was some funny Twilight bashing, 6x15 where reality and the show mixed together, and 6x18 where Sam and Dean enter the wild, wild west.  Season 7 is already stronger in my opnion (and I'm hoping Cas comes back in it later!)  If you are a true Supernatural fan, I do reccomend it.

If I Stay is one of the only books I've read in a long time that I can guarantee I will read again and again. It's also the first one to make a move for Lovely Bones' spot as my favorite book. I knew that Adam instead of Mia as the narrator would also bring a new perspective to the story, and I guess I wasn't sure if I was ready for that.  When the book started out, I had a bit of a hard time getting into the new POV. It's not that I didn't like Adam's story. I actually think that I was, for some subconscious reason, ANGRY with him. I'm not sure why, exactly, but I so wanted him and Mia to be together and I couldn't understand why his life was in such shambles if he was basically living his dream. I had so many questions at the beginning when I realized they weren't together and he was living on this celebrity image with the celebrity girlfriend and everything. I think it broke my heart more than a little to see how Adam was living because I loved him in the first book. However, the book really takes you through his story in his flashbacks and everything really starts to come together.  I eventually really did fall in love with Adam as the narrator. His flashbacks on Mia's coma and recovery were so eye-opening and, well, heart-breaking.  I loved how the author brought Mia back into Adam's life and the way they spent what little time they each had together. There isn't an unrealistic, instant \\"I forgive you for everything because I love you\\" moment when they first meet again, which was good because I would have put the book down right then and there. These characters are real people with real issues to work through. I mean, they haven't seen each other for three years!  Well, I think I should stop my ramblings before I start giving away the story~! I really, really enjoyed this book. It left me satisfied and with a smile on my face
B005LY4B0A|5.0|love this game..it passes a lot of time..I haven't found any problems..I hope they come out with new levels soon
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Looking at this as a normal purchase of $15, I'd have to say its a very complete Office style replacement program. Most devices come with reader only or lesser substitutes that just leave you with such limited capabilities. Officesuite Pro definitely fills those gaps of non functionalilty very well.  The connection to Google Docs is the smoothest of the major office editors available. No file format changes are needed and it syncs with three quick clicks. It seems like other file sources should be easier to sync as well.  Overall, its a great app even at $15. For the mobile professional or a student with a tablet, its a great investment.  For the person below that has had issues with the Keyboard not coming up in spreadsheet mode, selecting the cell will not bring the keyboard back... You need to select the cell, then move to the bar at the top of the screen where the cell contents are inorder to begin typing again...
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game is beautiful, the sound track fits the atmosphere and everything works like it should. I couldn't give it five stars because the game directed me to the review site after only a few minutes of play. If it continues to work without crashing and if the puzzles continue to be entertaining it would definitely rate 5 stars.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|A must have for the creative mind.  Even if it breaks (mine are still going) this is one of those toys that you remember for a lifetime.  And the price is very low to replace.  If I had 30k laying around I would pick up the giant wooden one.  This is the best toy that I have ever bought for my son (myself).
B005ER6SNM|3.0|The two most essential scenes are missing from the film.  Total runtime is 103 minutes. Deeply disappointed. Not because I'm a sick bastard, but because they've completely undermined the point of the film, and the suffering of Milos and his family.  I'm only giving this three stars because of the picture quality (which is quite good).
0525951652|5.0|I have enjoyed reading all of Ken's books in the past, and this book is just as enjoyable as the others. May start off a little slow, and is completely different than others due to the time period, but the overall flow of the book is very similar. GREAT READ!
157912688X|5.0|Sad Cypress was published in 1940. It's author is Dame Agatha Christie. It is one of the famous cases handled with genius by Hercule Poirot the egg head shaped former member of the Belgian Police.<br />  The Plot: Elinor Carlisle is a rich young thing from London. She is madly in love with Roddy Welman whom she has known since childhood. The two pay a visit to Mrs Laura Welman the moribund widow of Roddy's uncle. Laura is found dead; it is learned she died from a morphine injection. Suicide? A mercy killing? Murder? Elinor and Roddy's will bequest is in danger of being altered.<br />  Meanwhile, Roddy has falled in love with Mary Gerrard the fetching blonde daughter of old Ephraim Gerrard who works on the estate where Aunt Laura lived. Mary is found dead of poison. Elinor is arrested. Other chief characters include Nurses O'Brien and Hopkins. The key to the case is the past lives of the characters. Dr. Peter Lord is a character who loves Elinor and seeks to free her from a hangman's noose.<br />  The title of the novel is culled from a line in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. I like this book considering it a good novel to begin for someone who has not yet read Christie. The reasons for this are:<br />a. The book does not have an abundance of suspects to try and keep straight.<br />b. Elinor views the courtroom in London from the perspective of a prisoner giving immediacy to the proceedings.<br />c. The book consists largely of dialogue between the characters. Dialogue was a forte of Christie.<br />  A fun read for fans of Christie and British murder mysteries!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|OfficeSuit Pro 5 is a fairly unintuitive app for many users of MS word and Excel.  Many of the simpler functions from MS word is missing such as spell checker, input footnotes, grammar check, etc. OSP5 Excel doesn't allow x variable input for line graphs and uses different names for similar chart options from MS Excel.  Overall due to the lack of ease of life functions and strange UI names for Excel makes this app not as good as advertised.

1451648537|5.0|What a better tribute to Steve Jobs than to write a 600+ pages biography in a sympathetic yet not altogether favorably biased in capturing all that Steve Jobs was and had stood for -- his passion for perfection, total control, focus, and \\"reality distorting will\\" to make the impossible happen, in his personal life, at Apple/Pixar/NeXT, and his lasting legacy to all of us. A highly readable and understated book.   For those who are critical about his lack of philanthropic interests, Steve's single-minded focus to make great products demonstrates that social impact comes in different forms and motives (or lack of philanthropic ones, as was the case for Steve). In the book, even Bill Gates himself acknowledged when commenting about the success of the iPad and how Jobs, even while sick, was focusing on ways to improve it -- \\"Here I am, merely saving the world from malaria and that sort of thing, and Steve is still coming up with amazing new products...\\" Enough said.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|I've always liked Coldplay. Rush of Blood & Parachutes were awesome. Even Viva La Vida was pretty good.  This new album just bored me. Maybe I need a few more listens through the whole thing before it grows on me, but their new direction they've taken in this album just doesn't do it for me. Lots of Coldplay fans will like the album. Just personal preference.  Listening to \\"The Valley\\" by Eisley while typing this review. Now that's a good album :)
B004CLYKLI|4.0|Obviously, this is a polarizing book. I read it in the lighthearted, self-deprecating way it was meant to be read, so I really enjoyed it. Like many others, I read the WSJ article (with the misleading title!) months ago, and even back then I thought that this book couldn't be the spawn of Satan that so many were insisting it is. After reading it, I stand behind my original opinion.  Chua's writing is colloquial and easy to follow, and the story (or, really, stories) is/are entertaining. I have to believe that there's a certain amount of hyperbole in here because there is no way some of this stuff actually happened. Either way, though, the book is hilarious despite (or perhaps because of?) Chua's self-admitted scary craziness.  As many others have pointed out before, this isn't meant to be a parenting manual. No one who treats it as such is going to enjoy it. Many of the negative reviews slam Chua for being abusive and cold and blah blah blah. I don't think I should waste space in my review addressing my disagreements with their opinions, but let's just say that I think they need to lighten up and read the book in the way that Chua has said it was meant to be read.  So to summarize - don't take it too seriously. If you know you vehemently disagree with Chua's methods/ideology, just save yourself the headache and don't read it. If you grew up the Asian way and lived to laugh about it (like me), you'll absolutely love it.
0767817478|3.0|For the longest time, I have been a Godzilla fan. I have every movie, lots of toys, books and a few video games. I feel like Godzilla has grown up with me. I remember being so happy that Hollywood was going to make an american Godzilla movie. I thought the movie was in good hands with guys who made Independence Day (one of my favortie alien movies). But when the film came out, I was really disappointed with the results.<br /><br />Even as a kid, I knew the monster in this film was NOT Godzilla! Everybody knows the reasons why at this point. From being smaller and being weaker than the real Godzilla. They also tried to make him realistic by taking away his atomic fire and not making him indestructible. Those are what made Godzilla in the first place! Instead we get some movie with a giant lizard running around getting hurt and laying eggs! This film was not true to Godzilla nor toward the sprit of the films. The old films had aliens, other monsters and more. This film doesn't even come close to Godzilla standards at all. Instead, the film tries to be a poor mans version of Jurrasic Park. Many elements are clear such as the design of \\"Godzilla\\", the foot stomping effects and most noticably the baby zilla raptors. It's clear that this film wanted to be more like Jurrasic Park than Godzilla. But what really ruined this movie for me was the ending. I don't want to spoil it, but if your a G fan like me; this will be a big insult to you and to Godzilla. There is no way in heck Godzilla would go out the way he did! It makes it worse when the people in the movie actually cheer for his fate as if the filmmakers were trying to capture that ID4 victory scene again. As a kid, it always made me angry how they treated \\"Godzilla\\" in this film.<br /><br />However, I'm not trying be like everyone else and simply say it sucks. This film has plenty of good moments. The action scenes are fun to watch with lots of guns and expoltions. The acting was ok for this film, especially from Jean Reno. It's not perfect, but I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane standard. Plus, it's good for being a monster movie. The plot is simply a monster comes by and destorys New York, that's it. I'd like to think of this film as  a remake of \\"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.\\" They are both similar in every way. But what ruined this movie is the fact they called it Godzilla. It felt like they only cared about the name rather than the actual character. The filmmakers shouldn't be the only ones to blame. Toho gave them the ok to use that design.<br /><br />Overall, this is worth a check out if your a fan of giant monster movies. But it's likely to dissapoint you if you are a big Godzilla fan like I am. This film should not have been called Godzilla. Tri-star should have picked a great director that has love for the Godzilla series. Much like how Peter Jackson had for Lord of the Rings & King King and Sam Raimi had for Spider-Man. This film felt more like a cash in on a big time character. This film should either be called Zilla (Toho's offical name for the monster in this film) or Fraudzilla.Reno.

B005PW3OS8|3.0|Chris Evans did a great job playing Cap.<br /><br />The CGI to make Chris look small was great.<br /><br />The CGI to make Chris look super was horrible/lacking.<br /><br />I think a lot of people tried hard to make this movie but the directing/scripting was par.<br /><br />What was with Neal McDonough, he's a pretty good acter but he sure didn't do dum dum any credit.  I always pictured dum,dum Dugan a lot tougher, Neal made him look like a slouch and he sure didn't make the handlebar mustache look tough...<br /><br />Howling commandos, ok at best, definitely not 'howling'<br /><br />I wish the movie was more dynamic, super, amazing.  It was humdrum and disappointing.

0143119788|3.0|Le Carre succeeded at showing readers what the world of a spy is like: dull encounters and never-ending stress, with betrayal upon betrayal, and an inability to ever believe or trust anybody except yourself. Unfortunately, those revelations alone don't make for a good reading experience. In \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,\\" Smiley is forced into retirement when his Control oversees a disastrous operation in Eastern Europe. But then Smiley is called back, secretly, because the Circus (British Intelligence) has been told that one of the four people now in charge (of Intelligence) is a deeply imbedded double agent. Smiley must work on his own to discover which of the four is the traitor. This could, and should, make for a novel full of tension but, strangely, it doesn't. The novel is slow reading, with very complicated situations that are difficult to follow. On the positive side, though, reading this book makes for an interesting intellectual exercise: can you keep everything in mind so that you understand the results? Probably worth a try.
1439107955|5.0|A fascinating read, tracking the history of our understanding of cancer and its treatment.<br /><br />Beginning with Galen and Vesalius, and continuing to the spring of 2011, the author somehow manages to explain the underlying biology in terms a layman can follow.<br /><br />Those with family experience with breast cancer and leukemia will be especially interested, as those two cancers serve as examples and receive more detailed commentary.<br /><br />A very easy, almost conversational style (not perfectly edited, but let's not quibble) makes for an approachable book suitable for anyone with a passing knowledge of DNA.
1451648537|5.0|I'm about halfway through the book (on my iPad of course) and thoroughly enjoying the access into such an amazing persons life.  But man oh man, what a harsh portrait is being painted.  I almost feel funny for idolizing such a person.  I'm hoping the second half of the book has some more redemption in it.    On a related note, a little over a year ago I was eating in an Indian restaurant in Palo Alto, and ended up sitting in the table right next to Steve Jobs and got to listen into his conversation for 20 minutes.  He was with one other person and was going off on some Stanford professor they knew and saying what an arrogant ahole he had become.  Now that I am reading this biography, what I overheard fits in so well with everything in the book.
1439102732|1.0|What a disappointment! . I was so excited to read Jodi Picoult's latest book but this one does not have any of the multi- dimensional character development  and insightfulness that she is known for.The book is very depressing and drags on in many places. It is almost if she is writing to prove a  personal point to someone. Picoult's  bias against christianity overshadows her development of many of the christian characters and gives them obvious stereotypes and behaviors. This  is very atypical of her writing style. Her plot line which is usually full of surprises and thought provoking is very predictable. I wonder if she did the same character research on this one as she does for her other books. It is usually very hard to tell what Jodi personally believes, not with this book.  I would skip it . Hope this new writing style is not a trend .

Fortunately, Vertigo is now reprinting the early trade paperbacks of Hellblazer. This edition includes the Swamp Thing issues that introduced the infamous street mage to the Vertigo universe. Volume 2 is scheduled to come out in January and I have already pre-ordered my copy. I am so happy that now I can read the early trades of HB without having to pay $70-90 for out of print titles (suck it you marketplace leeches).<br /><br />Thank you to Vertigo for putting Hellblazer back in print.

What a great horror movie is all about not just blood and guts. But a great story that keeps you wanting more! Can't wait until tommorrow....
B00479SVBU|5.0|Does what it says & has so many features.  I dig it!  FM transmitter, thumb drive mp3 player, AND a remote.  This way it stays in my car & I only need to take the thumbdrive inside.  Sounds great, easy to use, and my kid can use the remote from the back seat (although needs to point remote at unit, but whatever....).  Highly recommended.  I'll check Satechi out again, for sure!  I wish it could play WMV files (I think it doesn't, right?).  mp4 files would be great, too.  But at this price?  Mp3 is fine.  5 stars, easily.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is a must on your Android.  I was having some trouble with my wifi.. this little app showed me what the problem was.  it is a nice tool to have.
1451648537|4.0|Having just power read the book, I found it to be good, but not great.  All said, I would definitely recommend this book, but I was just hoping for more. What the book left me with is, Steve Jobs was not afraid of no, he was not afraid to take risks.  He was relentless in his drive, imagination and intuition.  On those facets, the books drills that inspiration home.  If you have read many of the articles on Steve Jobs, or watched many YouTube videos on his speeches, this book is not exactly eye opening, but more of a chronicle and summary of all those articles, quotes,  and videos in one place.  For a deeply personal man, most articles written about him lacked insight into Jobs as a person, as a husband, brother, son, father.  I was hoping this book would share more of that.  I found there to be some areas that illuminated my understanding of this deeply complex and personal man, but overall, lacked that depth I thought this book would explore.   The book spends a lot of time chronicling Steve's career, how he made decisions, and how he created amazing product.  Yet doesn't delve into his personal life enough to get a sense of the man.  The book asked questions about why he was so mean, or why he would hurt people knowingly and with precision, but not a lot of answers.  There wasn't enough time in the book dedicated to his personal relationships, or lack thereof.  I thought there would be more direct quotations from him about being a father, his shortcomings, his failure, his successes on a personal level, his responses to how his friends and family perceived him in those roles.  There are plenty of quotes in the book about his views on Apple, tech, the dynamics of people in his career, but what about non Apple, non work perspectives? I thought there were be more personal anecdotes from the people closest to him, such as his wife or sister, but that was lacking.  Perhaps the book was lacking on this personal level because Jobs didn't share the side of himself, or because there were no answers to this enigma.  The book in a lot of way replicated his life, it was lacking on the personal stories, the behind the scenes, or peeks inside the heart of Jobs....his job, his passions to create were his life, the other things like having a personal life were in the shadows.

B005J7K964|5.0|I first saw this film seventeen years ago in a film studies course, went out and bought it on VHS, and shared it with lots of friends.  I was the first of all of my friends to own a DVD player, quickly switching over all of my old films.  This remains the one film that I still have on VHS and have been unwilling to part with.  I don't even have a VHS player anymore.  I have the soundtrack on CD, a wonderfully written collection of songs that becomes the dialogue in the film.  In essence it speaks for the characters.  The sound effects work well and the tinting serves to effectively emphasize the shifting moods and tensions of the film.  Very much worth the purchase.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|Visually interesting... for a while.  The story was so fragmented and slow that I found myself actually angry at about the 34 minute mark and stopped watching it.  I was shocked to see all of the reviews positive reviews as I could not even give it 2 stars.

Also if you open pptx having some formula it won't display. Developer should work hard to make it more useful.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|As an avid tech news fan, and Steve admirer, I couldn't wait for the release and quickly finished the book in two days. Steve, not Isaacson, is the shining star and his life makes for a fascinating story regardless of who is telling it. Steve's accomplishments, boldness, twists and turns, wisdom, intelligence, abrasiveness and intuition all contribute to intriguing reading. However, how good a job did Isaacson do?  Isaacson's job was \\"fair\\" for a couple of reasons. On the plus side, Isaacson appeared mainly objective in describing Steve, which is an important and difficult task, giving the controversial nature of someone like Steve. Isaacson, reveals both Steve's brilliant and ugly sides (I was a bit skeptical Steve would insist on a biography only painting him in a positive light). It was great to see his human side and get an understanding of Steve's polarized personality.  However, it was a little frustrating how much Isaacson re-told of which was already out there. I knew much of what he wrote about Steve - elements of his business strategy, dealings and philosophies and the Apple products he helped create and market. Most of the book's contents I was aware of through watching his keynotes, AllThingsD interviews, Stanford address and reading the articles about him on Wired, Time and other tech news sites. In fact, Isaacson often used such sources directly which I found slightly disappointing - like getting second hand info. On the bright side, I have not noticed any contradiction in these sources with Isaacson's version of Steve - it's accurate.   Having said this, Isaacson does give a fair amount of novel insight into Steve's family life, relationships and younger years which is not readily available through other sources. There is also a interesting detail about his Pixar years which I'm sure many are unaware of. Otherwise, light is shed on his relationship with colleagues and much about his personality, health and lifestyle are revealed. I think those unfamiliar with Steve and Apple might find this biography particularly enlightening about this talented, eccentric individual.  Finally, I do have a sense of Isaacson rushing this biography. The early and mid years were well covered, however later years were lacking on fresh insight and thoroughness. Chunks of story seemed glossed over or un-researched such as his relationship with Cook, Mark Papermaster's ousting, the reaction to Steve's passing, the future of Apple and perhaps more about his final days.  Something worth mentioning, is that the book did reinforce lessons I had learnt from Steve, the ones which stand out I will summarise:  * Life is short, make the most of it.   * We stand on the shoulders of giants, and it's our job to extend their work further.   * Focus on a few things you do well.   * Conflict can be very helpful in driving things forward.   * Love what you do and don't do it for money. Money is helpful in that it is there to improve the product/service.   * Keep re-inventing yourself.  Overall I find the biography easy to read, fairly thorough, provides some novel insight and balanced commentary and contains some profound words from Steve too. Reading a book about a man with this amount of intuition, energy, perfectionism, persuasiveness and determination can only enrich your life.
B00150VWX8|2.0|I bought this CD and was just very unimpressed with the conducting.  Maazel just barrels through the music without any regard for its beauty, like he's in a hurry or something.  I recommend George Szell's Wagner Without Words.  It's much closer to the master's (Karajan's) style.

B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is my first purchase from Gigabyte and so far it has gone pretty smooth. Bought this to replace my Asus M4A88TD-M, which is a fantastic motherboard, may I add, but I made the change due to wanting to go SLI. The first time I got the board into my case, I noticed how much larger it was than my Asus board, but this was expected. Luckily I have a full tower so it wasn't a problem. I don't know much about motherboards and how one compares to another other than the obvious, but this board seems to be solid and definitely worth it.<br /><br />One thing I'd like to point out is the space between the two PCI Express slots. If you plan on going SLI with this board, Gigabyte made sure you had more than enough room between the two cards to allow better airflow. I've seen cases where the cards are right up against each other, not getting any airflow between the two, but this board gives your cards room to breathe. Very smart choice. Also, the fact that both slots are running at full 16x speed is one of the main reasons I went with this board. Again, great design Gigabyte.<br /><br />The only problem I've noticed, which others have pointed out also, is the BIOS. The first few times booting up, the Gigabyte screen popped up like it should. However, after those few first times, I no longer get the screen allowing you to hit Delete for BIOS or whatever. I don't know if it's a glitch, something you have to set, or what, but I'm still unsure of how to get into the BIOS to do some overclocking. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br />I guess the Gigabyte screen actually does load up. I must just miss it every time I boot up. Anywho, I got into the BIOS for the first time and that was enough to overclock my processor from 3.2GHz stock to 3.6GHz. I should also mention, like someone before me, that if you have 1600MHz RAM, the board will automatically set it to 1333MHz, so you'll have to go into the BIOS, change it to manual from auto, and set the multiplier to 8x to get it to read full 1600MHz.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great motherboard. With it having AMD's new socket (AM3+), SLI, PCI-e slots both at 16x, a decent price, and just a solid board period make this a great buy. While the BIOS might be tricky to get the hang of, it's still a nice board. Definitely recommend it.<br /><br />PC Specs:<br />Case: AZZA Hurrican 2000<br />Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3<br />Processor: AMD Phenom II X6 1090t<br />Graphics Cards: SLI EVGA GTX 460 SSC+<br />Hard Drives: 3TB<br />Power Supply: Corsair 850w<br />RAM: Corsair 4GB 1600MHz<br />DVD Drive: LG 24XMHz.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Awesome FAOTD offering, thanks Amazon! This one is a keeper.  I like the interface on this one better than DocsToGo, the one I was using prior to today. It's also nice that it integrates directly into your google docs account, so you can download your docs straight into the program.
B005FMB8X6|5.0|This is an abbreviated review of the new version released this past week. 40th anniversary with Steve Wilson's help.  Firstly, for anyone familiar with the packaging and bundling greed of the new Pink Floyd releases and the new Jethro Tull Aqualung release should be very thankful for what Fripp has given us here.(Again) To have these releases in 5.1 with bonus content along with the 30th anniversary mixes is just incredible. Not only that, but at a reasonable price too! Steve Wilson is just brilliant. There are what I would describe as subtle shifts on the new mixes of the album and more significant changes in the Wilson \\"alternate mixes.\\" (Rhythm guitars particularly) This guy knows exactly what to highlight and when. It is like listening to the album all over again. There are even \\"rough mixes.\\" in the extras. Nice liner notes as usual too... CRAZY GOOD! *Fripp states in these liner notes that he is REALLY happy with this project/new mix. If Fripp is happy you know it's good!I totally reccommend this 2 disc set. What a great deal, especially in light of the ripp offs going on where they expect you to shell out ober $100 just to get the 5.1 mixes! (EG Tull and Floyd) ***The 5.1 mix in just incredible! What an experience.  *I am having computer problems right now but for anyone on the fence about this purchase, do it! Great band great work!

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews.  To me this album is pure genius.  This could be my favorite SW release, and that's saying a lot.  Do yourself a favor and buy the Japanese version or vinyl with the bonus tracks.  The bonus disc is a masterpiece by itself and actually contains my favorite track from the album, puncture wound.
0765348276|3.0|I was a bit suprised this was a nebula nominated book.  I mean, it was good and all.  The beginning and the ideas were engaging.  Then it went into a bunch of light battle descriptions that really had no tension, no sense of being there.  I also think the author was a bit too clever, which took away a bit mid book.  Then I got hit by the ending, which I really liked.  Overall good book.  If like military sci-fi you should check it out.
1607053551|5.0|I got this book not knowing a whole lot about fabric design, just a little bit of exposure here and there to the industry. This book is not a how to necessarily for step by step how to design fabric (IE using photo shop or illustrator) but rather focuses on resources and pros and cons of different ways to design fabric (IE block printing, Spoonflower, mass production). The book also touches on some of the business ramifications of each arena such as minimum runs, cost per yard and what to look for when selecting a process. I definitley would reccomend this book for anyone thinking about doing any kind of fabric design for a business purpose.
B00425S1H8|5.0|If you are an IT professional looking for a USB-to-RS-232 Console adapter, look no further.  The Prolific PL2302HX Chipset integrated into this adapter is the heart of what makes it work properly.  I have tried numerous other USB adapters with different chipsets and the PL2303HX produced the most consistent and accurate serial data transfers.  I ran tests using a legacy laptop running Windows XP and a standard DB9 serial port against a new Windows 7 x64 Laptop with the Plugable USB adapter and performed data captures and transfers with a Cisco router.  I did encounter a few problems when performing large file transfers, but the same problems were also encountered using the legacy serial port.  Unlike other USB adapters, I experienced no bit inversions, no lost connection, no console port lockups, and no baud-rate changes.<br /><br />The Drivers provided by Plugable are also great.  Drivers are available for Windows XP x32, Windows 7 x32, and Windows 7 x64, as well as MAC OSX.  I did not have a Mac available for testing, but the drivers and adapter worked perfectly under the 3 windows environments tested.  You will most likely need to change your COM Port assignment each time you reboot Windows or change to a different USB port, as windows will Dynamically assign a COM Port on a first-available basis.  However, I have noticed that once I disabled the non-existent serial port in the BIOS of my machine, my COM assignment stayed the same as long as I used the same USB port.  If all of this is a bit too technical for you, the provided PDF user manual offers step by step instructions with accurate screen shots for Windows Vista/7 and 2000/XP.  Mac instructions are also included, but I have not verified them.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I played the first one for many hours and the shapes were very easy to arrange to make rows of 3+. It seems this one has made a lot more challenging shapes, which may turn off simple only minded gameplayers. This can get very complex and challenging from the start, then the very first one at the end. Still as every bit as good as the first. Great visuals and interface, and the puzzle challenges are very clever! All the negatives people sayon are stupid, for free this is awesome! I'd maybe even buy it. Idiots will complain as always, shut them up and see for yourself. Android users are annoying, nearly as much as iphone users.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus, first published in 1818, is well-deserved classic of science fiction and horror. Mary Shelley's work, much like the similarly influential Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson (see my review of that here on Amazon for more on that tale), has almost been forgotten in its original form, as so many adaptations - most quite different from the original - have been produced in the nearly two centuries since it first appeared.<br /><br />The story begins with an introductory framing narrative by Robert Walton, an arctic explorer who catches a glimpse of a giant person traveling through the ice shortly before rescuing a stranded traveler who turns out to be Victor Frankenstein.<br /><br />Frankentein, a young Swiss student of chemistry and natural philosophy, relates his tale to Walton, who then records it in letters to his sister in England. Frankenstein describes how he created artificial life, only to be repulsed by the hideousness of the new being. Frankenstein abandons the creature, which then disappears.<br /><br />However, some time later, the creature begins taking revenge for his abandonment and misery upon Frankenstein's loved ones. Eventually tracking his creation down, the being tells Frankenstein his own tale of how he has attempted to befriend humans, only to be hated and driven away each time. The creature extracts a promise from Frankenstein to create a mate for him, after which the pair will disappear.<br /><br />Frankenstein begins to work on another creature, but eventually decides that he cannot create another monster and destroys his work. This prompts the creature to continue his campaign of revenge upon Frankenstein, eventually leading to the chase into the arctic. At this point, Walton resumes the narration and describes the final climax of the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation.<br /><br />The central theme of the story is the creation of life and the responsibility of the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life. Frankenstein, though the main character, could hardly be described as a hero in this narrative with his abandonment of the creature and self-centered actions, and the creature manages to illicit both sympathy from his lonely misery and horror with the lengths to which he will go to enact his revenge. Shelley does a fine job of taking the reader between these contradictions.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version read by Ralph Cosham, a favorite narrator of mine, and can certainly recommend Cosham's reading of the tale. Cosham's readings of the classics are always well done.<br /><br />Shelley's language will sound archaic to modern readers. However, if you can manage to get past that or you actually enjoy that style, Frankenstein is well worth reading. It has earned its place in popular culture and as a foundational tale in both the science fiction and horror genres. Do yourself a favor, and read the original Frankenstein. You'll find a lot more than the grunting, shambling monster of the movies. Shelley's creation is as alive, powerful, and intelligent as Frankenstein's.the creator to his creation, as framed by the now-classic science fiction device of the artificial creation of life.

0307888681|5.0|I have to admit being very late to this party, and still can't believe I plopped down cash for this book, as the whole zombie craze is a bit lost on me..  That being said, this book was riveting.  Different perspectives from individuals, different responses from countries, etc., makes you wonder how bad everything would really be for us all, in the event of a global outbreak of disease, famines, etc.  Sobering food for thought, combined with the zombie popularity.  all in all, a great read.   Even if you are not a zombie fan.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|I'm not sure what the deal is with Spielberg and his bad transfers to Blu Ray, but this is just ludicrous. I got War Of The Worlds a while back psyched to see the great eye candy of a great remade movie. The same was true with that release, it was HORRIBLY grainy, i checked my really \\"good\\" blu ray discs to make sure it wasn't my player or TV. So this doesn't give much hope to the old Indy movies that i'm waiting for. Close Encounters and E.T both looked incredible (like new films) and they were made in the 70's and 80's. Come on Steven, step up to the plate and supervise Universal a bit more during the restoration process, it's obvious they just do a half a## job. Luckily my cousin bought it before i did, so i just saved 50 bucks. So this review is for his disappointment as well. I waited forever for JP to be restored the way it was meant to be seen. I'll go back to my original DVD's, even the VHS Digitally Remastered versions look better than this. To sum it up, the movies are just full of grain, bland colors, and the dinosaurs don't look nearly as good as they did nearly 20 years ago. No improvements whatsoever. That is all. :)  P.S Check out the old Star Wars on blu ray. They look INCREDIBLE. Except the stupid looking newer CGI parts of course.
0743454537|3.0|I have always wanted to read this book, and was quite happy to find it for sale during a yard sale recently.  I finished the book I was reading at the moment in a hurry in order to start reading My Sister's Keeper.  My expectations were pretty high and I have to say they were not met.  My Sister's Keeper is about a young girl, Anna, who was conceived in order to be a donor for her older sister Kate, someone who has suffered through chemotherapy and all other sorts of treatments for leukemia.  At the start of the novel, Anna seeks an attorney, Campbell, because she says she does not want to be a donor for her sister anymore.  The book is told in chapters, each chapter narrated by a different character, including Anna, her mother Sara, her father Brian, her brother Jesse, Campbell, and Julia, a court appointed guardian who is to determine what is best for Anna.  Throughout the book, Anna seems to flip flop over whether or not she really wants legal medical emancipation from her parents.  The book is told over the expanse of a little more than a week.  Throughout that week there are many soap operaish moments, some cheesy moments, some sweet moments, and some very sad moments.  Sara's chapter that tells about Kate flirting with, and eventually dating, a young boy with cancer himself sticks out the most to me.  It's very sad, but as a reader, I had a few questions like what exactly caused him to die?  Was it the kiss with Kate?  What bugged me more than the ending, an ending which is mentioned in quite a few reviews here already, is Sara's character.  I found myself hating her.  She came off as a selfish person who only seemed to have one child, her sick daughter Kate.  She did not seem to care at all about Anna or Jesse.  She only seemed to care if something affected Kate.    All in all, My Sister's Keeper is an OK book.  It's not horrible but it's certainly not the best book out there.  I might read it again but I won't be reading it again any time soon.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I remember three years ago when I saw this movie with my mom and we were meeting a couple of friends to see it too. I had high hopes for this movie but was sadly disappointed. It was the worst movie about Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn and Henry the 8th I ever saw. It wasn't even historaclly accurate. First of all Anne was the younger sister not Mary. And the acting was kind of bad too. And there was a scene where Henry the 8th raped Anne Boleyn. Really? I know Henry the 8th was a womanizer and a tyrant but COME ON!!! A rape scene people? That never happened!!! And the scene where Anne and her brother were going to commit incest that was just a rumor Henry made up so he can marry Jane Seymore. That was just hollywood trying make it better. Instead they made it even worse. The ending was really strange too. At the end Mary takes Annes little baby daughter Elizabet and raises her when in real life Elizabeth always lived in a seperate palace and only saw her father when he requested her prescence so she like her other siblings lived lonely lives. And I don't think Elizabeth was allowed to visit her mothers family. If you want a good historical movie or show that most or all of it is historically accurate watch the 2003 BBC version of The Other Boleyn Girl and watch the Tudors that was on Showtime. The Tudors and that movie are what really stick to the truth of what really happened. Don't watch this garbage! The only good part of this movie was that Eric Bana, the man who played Henry the 8th was very sexy and we got to see him take his shirt off but other wise thats it.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|The movie was very good.  However, my review is of the product.  After paying extra for a digital copy, I find out that I can only watch it through flixter's crapy app and that it does not down load to iTunes.  In order watch in on a mobile device you have to have an internet connection so you can stream the video.  It kind of defeats the whole purpose of a digital copy.  If you are planning on buying this for the digital copy don't.  It is false advertising.  I will not be buying any more disc with an UltaViolet digital copy.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a fantastic replacement keyboard and is well worth the money, whether you got it free or it's the full $4.  The most painful thing about switching to Android from Blackberry for me was the need to use a soft keyboard.   While my typing in Android is as horrible as I expected, this software has made it a non-issue. Since you can set it to automatically put in its guess when you hit the spacebar, and since its guesses are pretty damn good, you can actually type really quickly with minimal error. I would still be faster on the Blackberry, but the tradeoff is not anywhere near as bad as it would have been with the stock keyboard.  One of my favorite things about it is that you can have it display arrow keys to move the cursor, so when you do make an error that it doesn't catch, you can easily go back and edit without deleting.  The only complaint I have is that performance seems to vary depending on the software you're using. I don't know if it's SwiftkeyX or the other programs' fault, but it can be a really jarring experience when all of a sudden your keyboard sucks. One example is in a telnet program I have, the keyboard all of a sudden becomes really really prone to double-strikes (like, literally 30% of keypresses it'll interpret as being hit twice).  But, happily, that's a rarity (I think that telnet program might be the only one I still use). So, four stars!

B0020GUXW2|5.0|So you could go pay $18 or so for the Bach Cello Sonatas by any composer, especially Casals, or you could get 7 more CDs for not a whole lot more money- and by the way, those 7 other less famous CDs happen to be very good too.  I do like the Bach Sonatas, and those are what I was looking for when I stumbled across Casals and found this one. However, as much as I rage against the global Walmart-esque Yo Yo domination of a fine instrument, I must say I prefer the Ma on Bach's first and most famous sonata- but only on that first.  The 9th disc has music you will not get anywhere else which is quite good, all written and/or performed by a Casals...a brother in music too?  Plus \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\" on a cello, which, is rather jaw-droppingly fast.  Great music from most of the masters of composing, terrific cello play, and a more natural feel to the recordings.  The quality is not always perfect, but it just sounds like you are at a live performance.  Which I prefer sometimes as the thinner or fuzzier sound just draws you deeper into the music because you have to listen harder to get it all.  If you do not prefer that, then go get perfect recordings by that perfect robot of cello play who grinched the whole industry with a fun and memorable name and flawless, soul-less exactitude, Yo Yo Ma.  Personally though, I'd have to say if you go with just the Casals Bach sonatas or with Yo Yo Ma and his name brand mark-up per disc- and I only tell you this because we are such good friends- you are really just a sucker who does not understand the concepts of value.  Love me some cello.

For only a couple more dollars you'll get four more new songs, including her great duet with country star Jason Aldean (\\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\") and a snotty \\"I Don't Not Hook Up\\"-like song called \\"Don't Be a Girl About It,\\" which upon second listen was actually my favorite song on the album, which is weird, being a guy.  As with all of her CDs, lyrics are included.
0689835604|5.0|I purchased this book to attach to a baby shower gift.  If you only purchase one book for a newborn/toddler, this is the one to buy.  It is interactive as it has items on the page that you lift to find the baby's belly button, eyes, etc.  At the shower a young mother of two, exclaimed, \\"Oh, this book was the favorite book of both of my children!\\"  Now that's the best positive affadavit for a book that one can hear.  I love this book and I know the new baby will too.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Just played around with the product and loved the interface on my honeycomb tablet. Really nice.. Needs deeper integration with google docs and its formulas.<br />Also needs integration with Dropbox. Another improvement would be in presentations to be able to change slides using a swipe action.<br />Overall a great product and if they listen to their customer's needs, i think this can be the best office suite on android..
B003VANOFY|5.0|These headphones arrived nearly fully charged and sounded great.  The surround sound worked great with both WoW and Fallout NV.  The surround sound also worked great with VLC, you just have to go to the audio options on VLC and tell it to use 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound.  The range is also great.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Comparing this to quickoffice, Both seem to be on par with each other. It will definitely suite your needs for basic editing and all that, but bear in mind 1 thing:  if you use a different android app (like quickoffice) to edit a document (in my case, an excel spreadsheet), and bring it up on OfficeSuite, it will get jumbled up. I haven't tested out a workaround for this yet, but a way to possibly fix this is probably to open it on a computer and save over it again and bring it straight onto office suite.   The interface looks nice and gives me the feel of a good ol' office software so that's a big bonus.  If a later update gives interapp compatibility I'll give back the 1 star that i took away.  EDIT 11/7/11: i've noticed that the excel spreadsheet when you make scene numbers that has a D or F it removes the letter (i.e. scene 5D would turn to 5. I would have to add a ' in front to stop it from doing that.) Not sure what causes that but it's pretty annoying.

B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I guess the only debate about these guys is which album is better, the first one (Is this It?) or the second one (Room on Fire). I have given both several listens and surprisingly this is the one I always come back to.  Solid from start to finish. If you only buy one Strokes CD, this is it- not \\"Is this it\\".  Both are good but Room on Fire is the kind of album that other bands can only dream of making. Oh yeah and their 3rd album is pretty sweet too.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It appears that the 3 developers need to get together to build the perfect Office product. This one is nice but has a few problems just like the others. The main problem I have is when putting in dates (10/24/2011) it changes the date to a numeric value. Docs2go does not have this issue. Quick office does not recognize the cell formatting so it does not exactly work their either. Docs2go does not show tabs like this one or Quick office.  Like I said, they all need to get together and merge to create a better one.

B003Y5H57O|3.0|It's hard to criticize a movie like The Thing - the 2011 film by first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen - as it is in fact a good movie and very well done. And had John Carpenter never made his 1982 version of The Thing (which itself was a remake of the 1951 scifi/horror classic The Thing From Another World), then this would have been a great movie. But Carpenter did make his film and therein lies the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that, while this new film is written as a prequel to the 1982 film (and why couldn't they have come up with some slightly different name, btw?) and slavishly dedicates itself to that purpose, it does not for the most part add anything to the story. Certainly not enough to warrant an entire film being made. If you've seen the earlier film, then nothing in this prequel comes as a surprise. And if somehow you never saw the earlier film, then there's no real point to seeing it after the prequel as nothing in it will come as a surprise either. The bottom line is, this was a completely unnecessary film. The basic plot and events are exactly the same, just occurring a few days earlier in a Norwegian Antarctic base instead of an American Antarctic base. Which you would already know if you've seen the first film. Both the Carpenter film and this film are good movies and both are very well done - but we only need one of them.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is set in 1982, the year of the original film.  At a research base in Antarctica, a team of Norwegian scientists, headed by Dr. Sander Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen), make an astounding discovery, buried deep beneath the glacial ice. Or two discoveries, actually.  The first is an extraterrestrial spacecraft that apparently crashed on Earth over a hundred thousand years ago. And the second a body of what may have been one of the aliens from the ship, completely encased in - and preserved by - the ice.  Determined to keep the discovery a secret but needing special expertise to research the body, Halversen recruits an American paleontologist, Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to join the project. The alien, whose outlines are just vaguely discernable through the surrounding ice, is transported back to the base where the scientists begin their research by drilling a hole in the ice to secure a small tissue sample. This decision has unfortunate consequences as shortly afterwards, while most of the scientists are celebrating their discovery, the creature bursts out of its icy confinement, incredibly somehow alive in spite of having been frozen for the last hundred thousand years.  Alive, and as the scientists quickly discover, more dangerous than any of them could ever have imagined.  The `thing' as they call it, not only attacks everything it encounters, its cells have the ability to mimic living tissue:  it can become whatever it kills or infects.  And suddenly the scientists are trapped in a paranoid nightmare:  which of them are still human, and which of them have been replaced by the thing?  Which is pretty much the dilemma of the first film, and so nothing that happens will surprise anyone who's seen the original.<br /><br />To its credit, The Thing does deliver the goods where the creature is concerned.  The skin-crawling creepiness of its various manifestations and forms and the sheer grisliness of its attacks are on a par with what Carpenter's original provided in spades.  And Winstead's Lloyd does come up with a clever way of distinguishing who's human and who's one of the things that is completely different from the blood test that was used in the original film.  But only fans of the first film will be able to appreciate what the director and writer managed to accomplish in making this a true prequel.  When I say that this version of The Thing was slavishly devoted to making itself a prequel, I mean it.  Enormous care was taken both in the writing of the script and in the filming of the shots to reproduce in exacting detail the images of whatthe American team found when they went to the Norwegian base in the early part of the original. And the very end of the film - you'll have to sit through the ending credits to catch it - dovetails perfectly with the beginning scene of Carpenter's film.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I will note that the new film's makers did allow themselves a possible basis for another sequel (technically the Carpenter film counts as a sequel now, at least in terms of story) to this film. Whether or not it's made will probably depend on how well The Thing does at the box office.<br /><br />One final note - I would have to rate the Carpenter film as better than this one in two areas. The Carpenter film had a better musical score, done by the immortal Ennio Morricone.  The new score by Marco Beltrami is not bad, but Morricone's bass-thrumming score lent an edgier tenseness to the earlier film. The Carpenter film also had better dialogue, and more humor, as exemplified in the classic line \\"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.\\"  On the other hand, van Heijningen's film does have one very funny dirty joke, related in Norwegian with English subtitles, that's so obscene I can't relate it here but is pretty damned funny nonetheless.<br /><br />And one final question - why is it that Antarctic research stations in these movies all seem to be abundantly supplied with flame-throwers? It's not the sort of thing you'd thing would be standard equipment for that environment, unless the alien threat in Antarctica is a lot greater than the new media would have us believe.<br /><br />If you've already seen Carpenter's The Thing, then I can recommend this film as a kind of filler-in for people who want to know exactly what happened in the events prior to the Carpenter film and don't expect much else. But if by chance you haven't seen the Carpenter film, then I would highly recommend you see at least at least one of these two films; it's just that there's no pressing need to see them both.<br /><br />But all that said, both films will still scare the living daylights out of you and probably show up in your nightmares.hey went to the Norwegian base in the early part of the original.

B004SIP8BG|5.0|I have just finished watching this in its Asian incarnation produced by GdFace.  If you love this movie you owe it to yourself to track it down. The soundtrack is so superiorly balanced in all aspects (music, sound effects, dialogue).  The translation to English is much more subtle and balances the written word with the spoken dialogue to great advantage. There is footage, anywhere from 2 seconds to 45 seconds, that was cut from the American release that is not just interesting but actually important. I love this film and now feel as though I have seen it for the first time.  Two small drawbacks.  The written intro is only in Chinese, as are the special features, but if you've seen the American version you know what it says. And periodically the company puts its logo in the upper left hand corner.  I found that after the second time I didn't really notice.  If you have never seen this movie rent the American so you get a grasp on the written intro and outro, and then find this edition.  I can't see a reason for watching the American version again.

1451648537|2.0|I was hoping for an insightful, entertaining book that does justice to the legacy of a great man. Instead, this is a flawed, insanely UNgreat book.  It is a tragedy that someone who gained access to Jobs for a semi-authorized biography squandered it in this horrible hackjob. The only good thing about this book is that it's so bad there will doubtlessly be other bio's of Jobs that other people will write. There are too many un-great things about the book to enumerate, but below are two main ones:  1) Poor quality. I read a lot of bio's and the ones I like are ones that give some insight into the person, rather than list dates and what happens like a bad history book. This bio does very little to really tell you what drove Jobs or what might have influenced him. There is no insight. Talking about how Jobs cried at this event or that doesn't qualify as insight. You don't feel like the author really knew Jobs. Or understood him. In fact, iWoz, a bio of the other Steve, actually gives you more insight into Jobs than this book. I rate this in the bottom 5% of the bio's I've read.  2) Insult to Jobs. This book is an insult to Jobs in several ways. First, Jobs insisted on quality, even if it took longer - no shipping a substandard product just to make the timelines. This book is a shoddy product, the antithesis of Jobs, a rush job. Second, Isaacson calls Jobs a businessman. Jobs calls Gates a businessman, and he means that as an insult. So therefore Isaacson calls Jobs a businessman...hm.

B0000020C4|3.0|To be fair, I didn't make this purchase from Amazon or I probably would have gotten it taken care of by now.  I bought a new set because I was under the impression the old set was damaged.  Since finding out it wasn't I had hung on to it to give as a gift at some point.  I decided that since I now have a car with a cd player I would use it in the car, opened the case and found I only have disc one, the other side is empty.  I doubt this is something that happens often, but apparently it isn't completely out of the question.  To make matters worse, I bought it from Borders so getting this taken care of might be a challenge ):

Also, the smoke color on my white phone makes it look clean. I have the 4S for Sprint, and this works perfectly for me. I recommend without hesitation at this price.

0425166805|3.0|I remember reading this book (as well as some H. P. Lovecraft) at the urging of students.  Unlike so many, who were attracted to, if not captivated by, \\"Chariots of the Gods,\\" the book struck me as little more than pseudo-scientific hypotheses (frequently expressed in the interrogative) written \\"on the fly.\\"  The so-called \\"evidence,\\" or its accuracy and credibility, mattered little to me--certainly not enough to fuss over its validity.  Von Daniken was practicing a form of what theological scholars call \\"proof-texting,\\" which basically means coming forth with a premise, a proposition, a \\"conclusion\\" first, then proceeding to cherry-pick whatever evidence appears to support any claim, however extreme or bizarre.  Hence, the plethora of interpretations of the Biblical literature, whether OT, NT, or apocryphal.  If you want to justify, say, capital punishment or unregulated capitalism as Biblical teaching, you should have little difficulty finding assorted bits and pieces to make your case.<br /><br />In the case of von Daniken's book, the author simply lucked out, tapping into a building interest if not \\"need\\" of a younger segment of the population not merely to believe in but to find tangible \\"proof\\" of extraterrestrial life.  It's fair to see the work as a \\"portal\\" to pop culture landmarks like \\"Close Encounters\\" and \\"Star Wars.\\"  Perhaps this sociological phenomenon was due, in part, to the diminishing hold of established religion among the boomers or even to residual disillusionment on the part of the flower children/hippies who had fallen short of \\"making the revolution\\" in a still-flawed and corrupt \\"real\\" world, a barrier to the longed-for social and spiritual sea-change that had once seemed both certain and imminent.  Or, given the persistent popularity of von Daniken's notions, perhaps it boils down to the \\"denial of death\\" that Ernest Becker finds as a universal reflex among human beings.<br /><br />Von Daniken's book would be easier to accept if its author acknowledged it as a form of literature, belonging to a sub-genre of science fiction or the fantastic.  But then the author would be as vulnerable for the carelessness of his writing as he has always been for the decidedly unscientific nature of his methods.  Still, amateurism might strike some of us as less offensive than misrepresentation.  A \\"period piece\\" as a book, the three stars are for its seminal influence as a pop culture phenomenon that continues to expand even as it refuses to play itself out.  The difference is that whereas contemporary readers of \\"Chariots\\" were searching for an alternative to a flawed society, today's readers are as likely to long for an alternative to the \\"virtual reality\\" that encompasses all of us, threatening to \\"squeeze\\" meaning out of personal experience and human consciousness.a form of literature, belonging to a sub-genre of science fiction or the fantastic.

0307454541|3.0|Props to any writer for creating something that touches readers around the world.  However, while parts of this book were great, as a whole, it left me flat at the end.  Put it this way, I bet if you cut about 150+ pages out of this, there's a well-paced, tighter, more satisfying book inside.  Unfortunately, between introducing waaaaay too many characters that, frankly, don't matter; a mid-section that drags to the point of skim-inducing; and an ending that goes on about 75 pages after the only dramatic question the reader cares about is wrapped up, the book feels more like a solid rough draft rather than finished novel.<br /><br />MOST FRUSTRATING OF ALL (WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)<br /><br />So our hero(es) chase \\"BLANK\\" to his death and then...the book continues on for the above-mentioned 75 pages to wrap up the Millenium/libel thing?  That would be like Clarice Starling killing Buffalo Bill in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but then the book continuing on for 75+ pages to wrap up some personal matter for Clarice back at FBI HQ.<br /><br />Watched the original Swedish film after finishing the book and the movie does a better job with the dramatic structure, pacing and denouement.  Worth checking out.

0786838655|5.0|I picked up The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1) because I like to start at the beginning of a series, and by the time I was four or five chapters in, I had the rest of the series downloaded into my Kindle. These are a great introduction to Mythology in my opinion. Mr. Riordan flirts with us, teasing with bits of myth that sound hauntingly familiar, and yet show us a fresh perspective on old friends. And, honestly, despite a lifelong love of mythology and folklore, some of the creatures he mentioned made me make a mental note to look them up later because I was unfamiliar with them. The ability to arouse a desire to research in a reader is a rare gift. His premise of the Greek Gods moving shop to America as the seat of Western Civilization drifted across the Atlantic was intriguing and innovative. In short, I loved the series and bought all his remaining juveniles as a result.

0062112430|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books and I cannot wait for the next 2 in the series.  Lauren Oliver is a beautiful writer- her descriptions are so detailed without being tedious.  This is a story of a future where love is regarded as an infectious disease.  Lena, the main character is counting down until she gets \\"the procedure\\" done- the day she will no longer feel emotions.  Her world is full of order and calm, because it is believed that creates happiness.  Lena can't wait for the change, because she is haunted by the fact that her mother did not \\"change\\" and ultimately fell in love, and committed suicide.  As the days approach Lena's change, she is exposed to what life could be like without it.  People unchanged love and cry, they listen to music and dance, and they feel joy and pain.  All of those things are illegal.  When Lena meets Alex- who turns out to be an invalid (rebel) her whole life changes completely.<br /><br />The book starts off slowly and other reviewers have mentioned that it is too slow.  I don't think so- Lauren paints a picture of how life is and what Lena has always known.  Once Lena meets Alex, the story picks up pace until I found myself actually holding my breath towards the end.  I think this is one of the most beautiful novels that I have read and cannot wait for the next!

B005IZLPMY|2.0|Honestly, I don't know what are this director's strengths besides his extensive background in VFX. I remember the first two Jurassic Park movies, just loved them. But when the third arrived in theaters I felt something was missing, didn't like it, yes there was more dinosaurs and things we never saw in the previous movies. It was a disappointing experience to say the least, completely lost interest in the Jurassic Park movies, and I think I was not even 14 by that time.  Well a few years later after being in school and having learned about story, script, storyboarding, lighting, camera, all you can name, I had a better understanding of film-making. By the way I am not saying I'm a genius or that I have the maximum authority regarding movies, this is my personal opinion. By this time I already knew the name of this director, already knew he was involved in the making of the great classic Star Wars movies.  Now to the point. For the last 10+ years I have enjoyed watching movie trailers in their maximum quality. The trailer for \\"The Wolfman\\" was great, I was so excited with the casting choice that I was desperate to see it. One day a friend comes and tells me the movie sucked, didn't want to believe him. Went to the theater and felt he was right, VFX were really really good, the movie itself: NO. I was glad to see they chose the practical way (make-up and prosthetics) for the wolfman, but in the end, not even the actors could save the movie, it was just.. too \\"flat\\", no real tension, no real motivation for the characters to do what they were doing.  And finally a year or more later, Captain America made his first appearance. Again, the story repeated itself when it comes to talk about the trailers. OK, I got movie, watched it, I almost fell asleep. But lets talk about what didn't disappoint me. First, I was not sure about Evans in the leading role, I'm glad to say he was good, not great but good. The rest of the actors did a good job too. Stanly Tucci's role felt too similar to that scientist's in the first Iron Man movie. I like Tucci's acting, specially in The Lovely Bones, which is a movie I had so much hope to be great... Anyway, VFX were great again, flawless, good cinematography. Now I think it comes to the script when I say I didn't like this movie that much. In my opinion, both Johnston and Evans could have done so much more with a better story. If you are teaming up Captain with the Howling Commandos, please make us feel that they are a team, that they are friends, that they care for each other. Someone else has said that the movie was a bit too long, I agree. You could have taken some time from those 2 hours and create a few sequences depicting their relationships, again, makes us feel that they were a TEAM. Like Transformers: the first movie showed us how well they played with each character but the last 2 movies, come on!!! most of the beloved characters were mute, so when a couple of them died, you wouldn't even care. Tell me I'm wrong when I say you DID feel sorry when Bumblebee was captured in the first movie. Now if I were to choose Johnston's best movie I would go for OCTOBER SKY, man!! that was a story with heart, it was inspiring, made me feel that I could achieve my goals no matter how far and difficult they seemed.  OK, so that's what I think when it comes to superhero movies, sometimes the script isn't good enough to make you feel REALLY attracted to the characters. I mean, Captain America was good but not enough to make me say: I wish I was that guy, I WISH I WAS CAPTAIN AMERICA. There are some movies that claim they are going to be \\"bigger and grander\\" in terms of a whole, unfortunately only a few succeed. Example? The Dark Knight, that movie really set a new standard in comic book movies. Iron Man 2, X-Men The Last Stand, Green Lantern, the latest Transformers films, they just forgot about developing a strong enough story and delivering us great villains and great story arks. They have tons of material they could use but sometimes they don't make the right choices. Did they make good money? Yes they did. Would I go to see them again in theaters? No, not even in 3D, which I think is not the greatest cinematic experience ever as some say. 3D should have stayed in theme attractions, for the kids, again NO OFFENSE MEANING to anyone.  Share your comments please!!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|would recommend to anyone that needs to work with Office files on their Android.  files load and edit quickly, even when i opened a 6 page word doc.  larger files took i little longer than expected to open but it wasnt anything drastic.  cons: some tables in word dont display correctly very large (read: ~200 pg, high res) pdf loaded pretty slowly. no print option (consider adding send to cloudprint or printershare)  other than those minor complaints its great, i look forward to using the app for all my procrastinated coursework :P

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I was looking for a case that didn't add much size to my phone, offered some protection, and was clear so I could maintain the look of the iPhone 4S. If you are looking for these things, then this is the case for you. Installation was a snap. The screen protector went on in less than a minute without any bubbles, and the case goes on easy as well. The case fits very snug and doesn't seem like it would come off without someone intentionally doing so. I would recommend this case to anyone not wanting a bulky case that takes away from the sleek look of the iPhone. The best part of all is that this case and screen protector combo is a steal!
B005FFW46S|4.0|I won't recount the story because you already know what its about but, regardless of typos and price, Snuff was just plain fun to read.  I found myself laughing out loud (unusual for me when reading) on numerous occasions.  I gave it a four star because the typos were a distraction.
B005XN30GA|5.0|Note: I saw this with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the premise of this new series (i like fantasy-type shows/movies) and decided to give it a shot. ABC has yet another hit on their hands (Revenge being the other hit; shame they don't think the same way about Charlie's Angels, which is produced by Leonard Goldberg, who produced the original series, which ironically, aired on ABC). The opening minutes just pull you right in and it never lets up from there. Adventure, suspense, magic, true love, the hope that dreams can come true. What more could one ask? At first, it gets a bit confusing keeping track of all the characters (ie. who's who in the fantasy realm and in the real world), but towards the end of the episode, it all clicks. I'm definitely going to have to view the pilot again. This series is just getting warmed up, and magic is in the air once again...
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Crossroads the movie arrived in good time, it is clean and we viewed the dvd without a problem at all. A good deal. Thanks.
B005ZO6DIO|5.0|Over the past month I have become a major fan of the series. Watched the first two seasons on Netflix, then the rest on Amazon. Great show and awesome story.  This episode blew my mind! Oh, man.. not Piney! How could this happen!  Anyway, looking forward to how this season comes to a finish.  Oh, and the Chuckie Chili! Just awesome!  Keep it up FX!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|These headphones are the absolute best. I was hesitant to purchase them because I've heard so many good things about Beats By Dre, but after some research I made a decision that I don't regret at all. A friend of mine owns the \\"Studio\\" model of Beats by Dre which sound amazing but the treble doesn't sound quite as crisp as the AKG K702 headphones, this may be due to the higher amount of bass in the Beats headphones. One thing to note is that there isn't much base in the AKG K702 which provides for an unparalleled treble experience. While some may view the lack of bass as a downside, a portable amplifier with a bass boosting function can be purchased to fix this possible dilemma, although in my eyes it is in no way a dilemma. One clear advantage of the treble is that music with an echo quality to it sounds simply amazing; these headphones mimic the sound of the acoustics in an orchestra hall, and are therefore ideal for classical music. An example of more modern music, utilizing this echo quality, is Benny Benassi's \\"Satisfaction.\\" When the synthesized theme/motive of this techno work begins, the excellent treble of the AKG K702 headphones makes for a sound, as far as I know, unattainable by any other headphones of the same price range. Another great example of this echo quality is the last twenty seconds of \\"Scatta\\" (feat. Foreign Beggars & Bare Noize) by Skrillex. Sound quality is top notch and so far the build quality of the headphones appears to have had an equal amount of attention.     One thing I don't like is that it's not really practical to wear these headphones around your neck when they're not being used. Because the ear pads are so large, they take up most of the space between my neck and chin and make it feel as if I'm wearing a neck brace, and at 6'3\\" I am in no way a small person. On the other hand, the over sized ear pads make for an extremely comfortable fit because they cover the entire exterior part of your ear without any contact. This makes for a fit where your ears won't ache after long hours of use, a problem that other over ear headphones tend to cause. Overall I must give these headphones a five out of five because honestly I've never heard anything like them. After purchasing these headphones I can confidently say that Beats aren't the only headphones that let you \\"hear all the music.\\"    Used and tested with the following styles of music:   everything but country
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|this game was fun and ran great on my nexus s with no problems. however, I am glad that I got this app for free because I would have been sorely disappointed if I had paid the $2 normal price. there were only five levels to complete and that went by really fast. It was fun while it lasted but now deleting after just two days because there is nothing else to do with it.
B001EC0OMW|5.0|A great classic from Hammer.  I rented it from Amazon and it wouldn't play through, but Amazon was great and when I told them they promptly refunded my money.  Thanks Amazon!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|The permissions seem a bit intrusive.  As much as I would like to have a reasonable productivity suite on my phone (doubly so for something inexpensive), I can't justify the trade-off in terms of security.  I guess TANSTAAFL applies here?
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this one... simple yet complex... music is beautiful. This one is my favorite one so far. I love it!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|When attempting to install I was warned that this app wants access to  - My messages  - Full internet access  - Full phone account access and credentials  - Phone status and ID's  as well as more.  However, the specific items above really boggle my mind, and I will *NOT* install nor recommend this product if this is the kind of information the app \\"requires\\" for installation and use.  What could possibly be the reason for all that?  Insane
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Blu-ray picture quality was awesome. Just a non-stop, action packed movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The sound is awesome too.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|a free app valued at $14.99. it's at least worth a look, no. well you never know until you try.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I rented this movie so my wife and I could enjoy a comedy instead of the \\"Hallmark\\" channel. Well, should have let her watch the Hallmark channel. After reading reviews, it seem to receive a gamut of reviews. Now, concise to state I am not a prude, but the language was coarse. My wife is quite sensitive to street language and I am often chastised for such. We did not finish the movie. Southern traditions are hard to overcome.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Permissions seem very excessive. Devs should explain in app description why they need each permission.  Thanks to previous reviewers for flagging this issue.  I wish Amazon would display permissions BEFORE you download the app.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Have watched the first five episodes and am quite happy with the quality of the dvds. The series is hilarious and witty. The characters, settings, costumes are top notch. Highly recommended.. a fun series, quite faithful to the original stories by Wodehouse.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America: The First Avenger, in my opinion, is this summer's top superhero movie. Heck, it might even be the best movie of 2011, period. Forget X-Men: First Class, Thor or Green Lantern. I'll have to say it, when noone else will, that this has to be Marvel's best, thus far.<br /><br />The movie, basically, tells the origin of how Cap came to be with him going up against The Red Skull(who himself is a super soldier). There's plenty of action and the performances of the cast are top-notch and believable. Chris Evans plays Cap much better than he did as The Human Torch in Fantastic Four(which I always questioned anyhow). He's definitely more physical in this movie, with all the action he does.<br /><br />However, where I find fault in the movie, The Red Skull doesn't get much screen time in the movie and-for that reason- he doesn't seem to be THAT serious of a threat to me. In the comics, The Red Skull is maniacal and is hellbent on threatening all humanity and making good on it. Like the original Batman movie(by Tim Burton), I was expecting the movie to portray the villain in as close a manner as he was in the comics but was disappointed that he wasn't. I can't find fault in Hugo Weaving, though. He did an excellent job as The Red Skull. Too, the conclusion of the movie seemed awkward and forced. I find fault in Director Joe Johnston, who seemed more concerned in laying down the origin and foundation for the upcoming Avengers movie. Not that that is a bad thing as it isn't but(..). With the sequel, however, he better 1-up everything...if he wants Cap to continue as a viable movie franchise. I suggest he looks to the Iron Man movies for inspiration or bow out while the gettin' is good and let someone else give it a shot. I know that's being critical but Cap deserves better.<br /><br />Other than that, Captain America: The First Avenger is a great movie. One of Marvel's best, if not THE best.
B001HN6922|1.0|After wearing out one disc of \\"Cars\\", we are on our second one.  My 2 year old son absolutely loves Mater and \\"Stickers\\".  With sheets, comforter, toys, movies, wall clings, and recently slippers shaped like Lightening that walks around in going vroooom, we decided this would be his first movie.  We waited until the 3rd or 4th week it was out, and went on a Sunday afternoon.  To make it better, there was only 2 other families in there, with children about the same age.  When Mater first showed up, the two other children and my son all screamed and hollered.  I thought this is going to be great.  Something he will enjoy.  It wasn't.  As other reviewers have stated this is a movie produced by left wing Hollywood.  Green is good and oil is bad.  I am fine with messages being in movies, anyone remember Bambi, but this one went way too far.  Children's movies lately have been a good mix of action, excitement, stellar animation, and just enough adult humor.  The adult humor is sly enough the kids do not realize it, hence Shrek or the first Cars (\\"Doc did what in his cup?\\").  This one tried way too hard to get the adult element into the storyline.  It seems they made this movie for adults and the 12-15 year old age group that would have been young when the first Cars came out.  Kind of like a storyline that grew up with the original viewer.    Keep it simple movie makers.  Family movies that make our young children laugh and giggle.  That we enjoy sitting down on the weekends and watching as a family.  Do kill the innocence in our youth with propaganda over and over.  Do not use your liberal agenda to influence children's movies.  Hoped this review helped just one person.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|What a great day when Amazon offers this great app for free.  If you have Google Docs try this one too.  You'll be amazed how user friendly it is and how it really works like the real MS Office.  This is a high quality app and now allows me to do my work on the go and not have to have my laptop with me everywhere.  Combined with dropbox I can share all my docs.  Thanks Amazon.
B004DSX5B6|3.0|While this utility tool works pretty well - it has some drawbacks.  The most glaring is the case has a flap built in it and every time you try to put the tool away it's a struggle. Some of the inner tools are hard to get out - but the ones used most often are on the edges and work well.  I bought this because the pliers tool has a spring loaded grip so they are flexed against you hand for easy use - this works fantastic. If they had a better case I would give it four stars.
B005I64U5C|1.0|First - I loved the 3D blu-ray version of the movie (good story and great special effects).  4.5 stars  Second - I HATE the so called digital version.  The download model that the studio/flixster/ultraviolet uses is way to cumbersome and complicated to work.  I own a PC, an iPad, an iPhone, and an Android tablet and I've only been able to make the streaming work on my PC (which is my last choice for were it should play).  Couple this with the fact that my movie collection already exists in iTunes makes this digital copy a waste of time.  If you want a digital copy of this movie that can be easily accessed, this is not the movie format for you.  I wish it weren't so.....
B004EPZ08E|1.0|If I pay for something, give it to me.  Don't make me share my purchase with Facebook, or keep asking me to enter in my credit card information in order for me to watch me.  Put it in iTunes, and leave me ALONE!!!  Never have I had such a terrible experience.  I will never buy another Flixster digital copy movie.  I hope that at least one person learns from my experience.
B00122HT04|1.0|here we have it folks, another AMAZING cd from an AMAZING band. I can't tell the difference between this band and the other 10000000 deathcore/metalcore/emocore/screamocore bands but this definately has to be # 1 in my opinion. I love the... generic riffs, lack of originality, and the totally BRUTAL name \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" For other good deathcore check out Limp Bizkit, Atreyu, Bleeding Through, As I lay Crying, and Ja Rule.  Avoid STUPID wanna be metal bands like Iron maiden, Slayer, Testament, Bathory, and any other junk from the 80s!
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins dissects several popular arguments for 'God' in his witty English style and follows with a case for morality being independent of religion.  Be forewarned that depending on your reading level you might have to look up the meaning of a handful of words.  Also be prepared to put your science hat on for a few pages.  I would expect this book reads better for an atheist than theist because of the general tone.  Although Dawkins' support for the case there is almost certainly no god(s) is convincing to the open minded, I doubt the book will convince many believers.  Either way it is a good book to hone ones apologetic or counter-apologetic skills.
0439813786|5.0|I have always loved reading, lately I have been intrigued by graphic novels. I purchased this book after a friend suggested the author to me, and I had seen the movie trailer. I enjoy reading books before seeing their onscreen versions if possible.  I was completely blown away by The Invention of Hugo Cabret. The illustrations captured my complete attention and interest, I couldn't get enough. The text was well written, and left me eagerly flipping each page. I read the entire book in one sitting and couldn't stop thinking about it after I was done. It was unlike anything I had ever read before.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a solid story and gorgeous artwork. The Invention of Hugo Cabret will be a permanent part of my home collection, and a book I plan on revisiting again and again.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is an excellent movie about having the courage to face one's biggest fears and find one's true voice.  I can understand why this movie won so many awards.  I highly recommend it.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Although some on the reviews are complaining about this set not having all the extras, if you want the whole set of movies, this will probably be your last chance, unless you want to buy them individually, and even the time to do that is limited.

B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Well, I thourghly enjoyed this version of Evangelion.  The graphics were movie quality.  The Engilsh dub is on par with the original.  Story and plot were chillingly excellent.  However, I could tell there were changes in their voices.  They are older now, so that is understandable, but I their original voices fit better.  Another thing I noticed is that there isn't that same emotional spirit in 1.11 compared to the English dubbing of the original series.  Just compare the emotional joy you can hear out of Ritsuko when she says, \\"He's walking!\\" in the first episode of the original, versus Ritsuko exclamation in 1.11.  You could tell that the voice actors had a lot of fun doing the original.  But, they still do a stellar job of the English dub in 1.11.  Another thing that fans may or may not like, is that 1.11 is more condensed.  There is no filler at all.  This is good because the story progesses quickly and is more condusive to action and a sense of urgency.  However, the character developement is reduced.  But not reduced so much that the characters lose their emotion, their feelings, their reason for being.  The difference in character developement between the series and 1.11 is that the series had more time.  In the first 5-8 episodes of the series where we see Ayanami's life is completely desolate; in 1.11 her life is empty.  In the series Ayanami's life cuts our soul, in 1.11 her life hurts us deeply.  This is pretty much the same for most of the other characters.  Character developement is absolutely great.  But its hard to compare with the series that had 3-4 times more time to develope their characters.  You'll be relieved to know that the plot, pacing, timing, etc, etc, ... still retains its Hitchcockishness.  The complexity and mood wrenching is completely intact.  Even compared to the original I really can't find any faults in 1.11.

B000002HJD|5.0|This CD contains some of Morrison's finest work! An excellent portal into the mind of one of Rock's greatest artists.
B005JU5JTI|3.0|This is not a serious movie, it is silly and irreverent. I actually liked it better than I thought I would, and it is fairly witty. I don't think it deserves the negative reviews.   The movie flows well, and comes to a few pretty nice points by end, and along the way is sassy and humorous. I watched it, with my teenage daughter, who liked it as well. To the point of Cameron Diaz's acting skills, I thought this role actually had more depth, than her usual movie.   My other point, though is streaming service for this movie on a Saturday night, was particularly poor. We had several breaks and stutters in streaming, and at one point actually waited over 10 minutes before it came back on line again. I have not had the same problem with netflix or hulu. And at the cost, they are charging, considering redbox is around the corner, I maybe rethinking purchasing streaming again.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I had the same problem. It asked me to set up payment, which I already had done in the past.  Closed my browser, re-opened went back to app and purchased and downloaded, as it's supposed to.  Now to try it out... works great!!

B004J1DBJI|1.0|I would give 5 stars normally. But since last update the app crashes. PLZ fix this bug. Then I'll give 5 stars again.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is a really fun but there are some downsides to it. I'm running this app on a galaxy s2, so I can't figure out why it crashes on me almost once every level. The game will be fine until I get to the very end when it says a lot of zombies are coming, and then almost every other time it crashes and I have to start the level over, it's extremely annoying. The only other downside is that the game looks very pixilated, which other reviewers were also complaining about. Hopefully they will fix the crashing issue, because it almost makes the game unplayable...
B0044RUSZM|1.0|The product does what it does - it lifts up your laptop. But that doesn't mean Griffin did it right.  I often find the Elevator lacking in sturdiness. Just a slight touch to the arms almost guarantees a vigorous shake. The arms are also too small that I doubt it would collapse one day.  I have put the Griffin Elevator away and now use mStand, as it's just much sturdier and much more aesthetically pleasing.  Update: This product is unacceptable. I'm using a wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse to work with my MacBook Pro, and every time I place my hands on and leave from the table, the product wobbles vigorously. This is hands down the worst notebook stand I've ever seen and I advise against using it. I'm getting the mStand.
0307352145|4.0|Since reading Elaine Aaron's book [[ASIN:0553062182 The Highly Sensitive Person]]and the Briggs-Meyers based [[ASIN:B003P2VDJW Do What You Are: Discover the Perfect Career for You Through the Secrets of Personality Type]], both of which had a strong and positive impact on my understanding of myself, I was really excited about seeing what new information was available on the subject.  Part One of this book was great, and I was tempted to give it a glowing review on that basis alone.  Part Two served to dampen my enthusiasm.  The author chose, as examples, public figures.  That is understandable:  it gives the reader is the opportunity to consider the figure's behavior over time, and to see how that personality trait affected the individual's life and relationships.  Perhaps choosing a number of political figures, given the public focus on the next presidential election, makes sense:  politicians are getting a disproportionate amount of air-time these days.  But focusing on liberal politicians...Hmm.  Why?  What does the author want the reader to understand from that?  Since she makes a case for introverted people being more thoughtful, more considerate and deeper thinkers, a reader might conclude that those politicians mainly inhabit the left side of the political spectrum.  Maybe in the author's mind, but the reality is that such people inhabit both sides of the isle, just as the extroverted politicians do.  Plenty of non-fiction authors write about psychological issues and are liberal, but don't feel the need to use examples from such a specific population.  In fact, wouldn't most authors want balanced examples from a wide range of the population to illustrate their premise?... if only to prove that these findings are valuable when considering anyone they know personally, or meet in day to day settings?    The author has created, in my mind, an unnecessarily distraction from what is otherwise a very informative and enjoyable book.  In no way am I indicating that everyone who reads the book will find this to be the case.  And while I am tempted to sound off on her laudatory comments regarding Al Gore, who brought global warming concerns to the fore yet refused to debate them, and apparently didn't learn in grade school that the earth has gone through extreme cycles of hot and cold in the past, changing our flora, fauna, and land masses numerous times or that there were more buffalo producing more gas on the American plains before western Europeans arrived than cattle we raise today....oops! (I wasn't going to go there!  Obviously, the \\"lone voice in the wilderness\\" bit was quite irritating to me!    Nevertheless, the book pulls together many studies in recent years.  In Part Three, the reader, if a team leader, is provided with practical suggestions to elicit ideas from both extroverts and introverts in ways that allow all ideas to stand on their own merit.  It encourages the introverts out there to present their ideas, and suggests ways to communicate without being drowned out.  It also has suggestions for partnership decisions between an extrovert and an introvert.    The book is highly readable, and well worth reading.  Just be aware that the author's political bias becomes obvious over the course of the book.  The book would have been better without that indulgence.
1416575464|2.0|the worst gushed over book that i have ever read and the only decorating book that i have purchased in years that i did not keep. I simply hated this book, but did enjoy the magazine.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|\\"No better and no worse\\" a lyric from Lost! that pretty much sums up this album. I've been a Coldplay fan since Parachutes. I understand that the lyrical ballads of \\"Parachutes\\", \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" and even \\"X&Y\\" can only be done so many times, but why this? It's just so radically different from anything they've created before. I don't know why they sold their own unique creativity to Brian Eno (who has helped U2 and Radiohead).I've always loved Coldplay for their lyrics, and not a single song on this album is lyrically creative or profound in my opinion. Again, I understand they cannot possible keep producing songs like \\"Sparks\\" and \\"Fix You\\", but this album is just so so different. I feel like it is from a completely different band. I wish this album was more like \\"Vida\\" where some tracks were radically different from their usual but with some songs that kept the feel of old Coldplay going (ie \\"Life in Technicolor ii\\" and \\"Strawberry Swing\\")   Anyways, I rated the album a three of five stars because some of the tracks I do quite like, although they lack depth. \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"Us Against the World\\" and \\"U.F.O\\" are notable amongst the rest of the sounds on the album.   All in all, if this is what Coldplay wanted to do then congrats to them for not slaving to their fans, because after all music is from the heart. But if they sold out their passions to become radically different from the suggestion of Brian Eno or the general public, shame on them.  I am still a fan but a part of me hopes there is one more album after this so I am not left with such disappointment.

B0057R5XRG|1.0|I'll preface this by saying that I am a HUGE Jurassic Park fan. It's what I played as a kid. I've probably watched it close to 8 billion times. I was 6 when it came out, so it left a big impression. Obviously, I had to rush out to buy the blu rays I had been waiting so long for. I got home and immediately put in the first movie. Within 5 minutes, I was disgusted.   This is the worst transfer I have ever seen. It's VHS bad. It's 1960's spaghetti western on antenna bad. I have a pretty decent collection and I prefer older movies so the flaws of production stand out and give it a surreal feeling. Total Recall, Clint Eastwood movies, Star Wars, etc have all been given worthy transfers. Now, people may say \\"it's 18 years old, what do you expect?\\" I expect a movie that won the Oscar for special effects not to look like an impressionist painting. When they see the first dinosaur in Jurassic Park, the background moves because of how grainy it is. My VHS set when I was a kid had better clarity. I am appalled by the low quality of this set. I will be returning it and I no longer look forward to Jaws coming to blu ray if this is what Spielberg thinks is acceptable. This collection is a travesty.  If you care about video quality, the transfer rate will actually make you mad.

B0057URWSQ|5.0|I love this show and the pilot is one of the best episodes of the season.  It is about a normal guy with no real goal in life although he was born with a photographic memory.  He \\"bumps\\" into a hot shot lawyer and becomes his apprentice (junior associate).  A great must see show!! My only complaint is that the show won't be back on until next summer.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have been using a different office program.  I have a very large multi tabbed excel file that it could not open without a memory problem (Atrix).  This program opened up all of the tabs without a problem.  This is now my default office program.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm extremely excited to see this today.  It looks like Ms word, feels like Ms word, and since I'm used to using Ms word, I'm definitely very enthusiastic about this app!
B005F9CPG8|5.0|the way it is remastered is perfect.it is as tho if you close your eyes you would think that you are there with the beatles in person----now you know it don't get any greater than that.i bought this cd through amazon new for $10 dollars and  3 dollars postage
B00243FQFA|5.0|The return of the city of Atlantis back to earth is awesome. It also opens the door to speculations about the real existence of Atlantis here on earth today. I never expected Mr. Wulsy (Picard) to turn his personality around and be the very one that broke all the Rules of the IOA, when he was the one that was so intent in enforcing them. We finally see Dr. McCay's tender moments with his new girl friend. Season was very well executed.
0307887960|1.0|I followed this diet EXACTLY the way it should be done for a month more less. I lost nothing more than 4 pounds in all that time (lot less than it is promised) but not only that.. I had to cancelled it after that month because I got a serious constipation problem and I had to go to the doctor. The doctor told me that my problem was due to the diet and that it was a terrible unhealthy plan. So I quit the diet and started to eat balanced meals and I gained the few weight I lost!!! I regret doing it very much!!!!!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Not too happy with this one. Half of the DVDs wouldn't play the episodes!!  So I missed out on soo much!  I had to fill in the blanks  by watching the next episode (if that one would even play)
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I would love to review the actual function ot this app but It wants access to every aspect of my device and my personal information on it for no good reason that I can see. I refuse to install it on those grounds. Any security conscious persons should do the same.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I know you want to laugh.  $4 is not a lot of money. But, we're still in a recession.  Wasted money isn't funny. Want to know what else isn't funny? This movie. I am typing this review WHILE watching the film. It's that boring.    For a woman who loves Jason Bateman, adores Jamie Fox, enjoys Charlie Day, and likes Jennifer Anniston, I am both surprised and disappointed.  I am surprised that a movie full of my favorite actors has failed to deliver. I am disappointed that it sucked.  And I waited so long to see this.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app does everything it says. I am very pleased with the quality and how easy this app is to use
B0042EJD8A|5.0|\\"Gasland\\" took a good run at being the most terrifying film of 2010. The reality that our modern technology, especially our energy technology, might be both unsustainable and deadly dangerous is indeed terrifying. The specific horror in \\"Gasland\\" is the possibility that hydraulic fracturing (fracking) as method of extracting natural gas from deep shale deposits may be responsible for perilous contamination of our water supplies, both of ground water and of streams. If so, that would truly be terrifying. The secondary horror depicted in \\"Gasland\\" is the ineffectiveness and/or collusion of our environmental regulatory agencies. Honestly, I can't verify or contradict the thesis that fracking is contaminated ground water; there are vociferous arguments on both sides of that question, leaving me, as a single voice, only the fall-back position of \\"Better safe than sorry!\\" However, the second thesis, that the fracking industry and the whole petrochemical mega-industry is disastrously under-regulated and irresponsible is gospel truth, beyond any reasonable doubt. We don't need to watch tap water being ignited to know that! We voters had some \\"hope\\" after the 2008 elections that the plutocratic tyranny of Halliburton and of Big Oil might be challenged by \\"change\\"; so far we've had to cherish the \\"hope\\" despite the lack of \\"change\\".<br /><br />\\"Gasland\\" is a well-done home movie, a documentary made by a thirty-two year old guy with a hand-held camera and little education in film-making, or hydrology, or chemistry ... just a modest ordinary guy who has gotten worried about the environment, first of his own home turf in the Delaware Valley, then about the 'big back yard' America he travels across. Most of the footage is of interviews with ordinary Americans who are convinced that living near fracked gas wells has spoiled their health or their welfare. Filmmaker Josh Fox has learned his style, I think, from Michael Moore, though he doesn't yet have the financial resources for a production like Moore's most recent releases. Fox is the main persona of his own film, as Moore has usually been. To my mind, Fox is a more likable guy than Moore, and his likability makes him more convincing. But that might not be an asset; I don't want to be convinced by Fox's personality but rather by the information he conveys. The critics of this documentary rage that Fox is deliberately disingenuous, a charge also leveled at Moore. It seems to me that a more serious question is the inherent value of a documentary of this sort: Yes, it alerts large numbers of people to a potential calamity who might otherwise never get wind of the problem until too late. But No, it can't and doesn't present the whole story, with enough fact-based insight to guide people toward intelligent political decisions. This is a 'sensational' documentary film of 106 minutes. How many people who see it will invest even another 106 minutes in learning more about the issue? What I'm saying is that films are just too convincing! In fact, all the electronic media are just too convincing. Too dramatic! Democracy demands dispassionate discourse. As my favorite bumper-sticker reads\\" \\"Don't believe everything you think!\\"<br /><br />Meanwhile, however, the energy industry really doesn't want you or me to think. That's obvious in the shenanigans that surrounded the environmental impact studies in preparation for the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, intended to carry crude 'oil' from the oil sands of Upper Canada all across our 'purple mountain majesty and fruited plains' to the refineries of the Texas Gulf Coast. This is NOT a project to be rushed! Vast corporate profits should NOT be the prime consideration here, and not even perhaps a consideration at all. The prime consideration should be the environmental/ecological impact, not locally but globally, not in our lifetimes but in the lifetimes of our children's children's children. Only the federal governments of the USA and Canada can properly instigate and oversee the rational, impartial discourse that should precede such an awesome project. Government regulation is our only protection against corporate indifference to our long term welfare and to our community values. I strongly urge President Barack Obama (for whom I voted enthusiastically) to keep some of his promises ... to stop the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline until the \\"informed\\" electorates of both the USA and Canada have had time and info to evaluate the consequences.oversee the rational, impartial discourse that should precede such an awesome project.

B005JU5JTI|1.0|What more is to be expected from Cameron Diaz? No wit and no talent, really. This movie is nothing more than a waste of money.
0439023513|3.0|It was a great book, but I feel like this took it too far.  The first two books followed a story line, and this kind of went out of the way.  Nonetheless, a great book
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this based on all the rave reviews. When I first got it I thought it was too big. I like smaller knives 4-5 inches long and an inch wide or so. Now that I have been using it, it's growing on me. One thing I was surprised about was that the sheath was actually ambidextrous, just requires unscrewing and flipping the belt clip portion around. If you are left handed you know how frustrating living in a right handed world is, I had planned on a custom sheath. Slicing, chopping, hacking stabbing or digging this knife isn't going to flinch. It really is a jack of all trades so keep that in mind because its not going to fillet like a fillet knife or skin like a skinning knife and chop through jungle like a machete BUT it will do all the above. I have also customized mine, not being a fan of the tactical look I stripped the black finish off by soaking it in acetone for about 20 minutes then took a wire wheel to it, then had some custom wood scales made. It is a beautiful knife now. The unfinished metal and wood give it a really rustic look. Next up is making an new leather sheath to completely get rid of its tacticalness (if thats even a word) . Buy this knife.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this app for free. It is excellent. Fast (very fast), easy to use, great user interface, and have enough basic functions for mobile editing. The synchronization with gdocs is very good too.
1451629184|4.0|\\"Stolen Life\\" will give you an inside look at what Dugard had to suffer through for 18 years and how it shaped her to be the woman she is today. Despite the horrors she faced, she has an optimistic view on life that is inspiring. Although difficult to read at times because of the awful situations Dugard had to live through, her story is amazing - and will stick with you until the end of time.    Read my full review at [...]
B0053TMP24|5.0|I did enjoy the first book, however, Jason had a major character flaw. He felt to perfect.<br />Bringing back Percy was needed. He is a flawed but good hero. He makes mistakes. Book two was a fast fun and easy read. I enjoy the other characters but could the fact that Percy has already been established in another series be the reason his personality shines even brighter?
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Well, I have to say, as a GL fan, i liked the movie.  This review is not a review of the film, but of the product.  I see Amazon has changed the \\"digital copy\\" to \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\", however, too little too late.  I will not be buying any UV digital copy movies.  It's a huge annoyance, but I will gladly buy the Blu Ray ONLY and then spend 15.00 in iTunes for a product that WORKS.  I travel a lot, and Digital Copies + my tablet are a godsend.  I have an iPad, but I've heard around the internet that this service won't work on Android tablets either.  I hope people boycott this new format.  I tried to download mine, but I couldn't get it to stream or download, and had to sign up for so many new services that evidently promise to be the \\"hub\\" of my digital life (reality check, Apple has already done that, and beyond them, Amazon), that I backed out, and discontinued all accounts.  Movie Studios-  I love the work you are doing, but you are NOT going to unseat iTunes.  Apple has won, deal with it. Almost everyone who has adopted digital media buys through iTunes.  They've invested in it, and they will continue to do so.  SUPPORT IT.  If anyone besides Apple could carve a niche, it was Amazon, and they did that by creating a great, easy to use alternative for media.  This restrictive BS is ridiculous.    I have cancelled all my preorders for UV products, and I'm really considering not even buying some of those movies now.
B0051OZ564|1.0|The movie started out interesting as they went through the first fantasy action scene. Then the second scene was just like the first fantasy sequence. After a few more predictable fantasy action scenes, we just wanted the story to end. It had a nice graphic novel look, but there really was no substantive. I think that if you're an 18 year guy raised on graphic novels and 1st person shooters, you'll love it. Maybe the rest of us are just too old to get it...
B0027REDK2|5.0|Ive had this on cassette tape a few times over but never had it on cd & FINALLY!  It's an oldie but a goodie! If you grew up as a teenager in the early 80's it was a must & a still is!  Great songs, great memories!
B003L77G06|5.0|I don't have cable in my home, so I view TV series when released on DVD. Modern Family Season 2 was as fresh and funny as season 1! Really fun viewing!
B003F3NDWG|5.0|New concept on television-an author working along side a beautiful detective (who becomes a muse for the writer). The show has attractive actors and super storylines. I really like that the character author \\"Richard Castle\\" has books that are published in real life along with the shows publication of the books-very clever.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Solid game with crisp graphics and bugs that are funny to watch.  Only minor complaints are difficulty for some levels seem out of place and hint system is different, should be able to build up hints.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|As a diehard Bonamassa fan, I had no idea what to expect from this pairing with Beth Hart.  But what a stellar combo!  Beth's sultry vocals evoke Billie Holiday, Etta James, and even Janis Joplin while Joe's guitar-playing finesse reaches out and grabs my soul, as usual.    These are not new songs, but slightly reworked classics done beautifully.  The title track, \\"Don't Explain,\\" haunts in the most pleasant way.  I cannot get it out of my mind.  When I listened to one of the sampler tracks, I experienced a momentary fear that Joe was going \\"country,\\" which would be the worst thing ever!  But rest easy:  \\"Well, well, getting to know you so well,\\" is simply a rollicker, with high energy.  It's as \\"country\\" as this album gets, thank goodness.  I am on my 10th or possibly 12th listen straight through (in my car) and haven't gotten the urge to replace it in my disc changer at all.  Highly recommend a listen.
0385534639|5.0|I finished reading \\"The Night Circus\\" last week, and am so happy I came across it. It's a beautifully told story of magic and love, filled with an unusual cast of characters and settings. This story is deeply and darkly emotional, one I truly felt. Thank you, Erin Morgenstern, for bringing the Night Circus to life. I'd visit it in a heartbeat!  I highly recommend that you read this book, but only if you want to be swept away into a colorful and fascinating world!
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|runs fine on my EVO 4G if u keep the game in the phone. when I move to SD card, fame FC's nonstop. I uninstalled and reinstalled but no luck. was fun but 20 megs is to large...I need the space.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|When Chuck first came on tv I thought \\"Give me a break, what a silly concept\\". I was wrong it works. Nerdy but attractive guy who becomes a spy, a gorgeous spy who loves Chuck, and her no nonsence partner and the rest of the cast make this show a fun one to watch and look forward to watching each week. This show is definately worth collecting each season.
1451648537|1.0|I don't understand why people are so in love with him.  By all accounts, Wozniak was the technical wizard behind Apple, not jobs.  The company he started, NeXT computers, was a total failure.  He didn't start Pixar; he bought it.  He was a tyrant and was was famous for being extremely difficult to work for.  This book is not objective at all.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|a very good app for handling office productivity while in the go. while it's no substitute for the real deal, this app comes in handy
B000001FSU|5.0|State of Euphoria is an excellent album.  One of Anthrax's better ones.  If you're really into thrash/speed this is one to purchase.
B00514HDNW|3.0|It was an okay book although I found it a bit boring at times and the ending could have been better.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is a unique show that hopefully will be around a few years-the longer the better. Better than average storylines and attractive actors make this show one of my favorites. Try it you won't be disappointed.
B004VQRCF0|2.0|This was not their best performance,is not a complete show, and the video and sound quality leaves much to be desired.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book is hilarious! I absolutely loved it. Ms. Kinsella is a fantastic writer. She did an excellent job fleshing out the characters and the story. I feel like I really know these characters. It's fluid throughout; there was never a moment I wanted to rush through a page. I highly recommend this book!
