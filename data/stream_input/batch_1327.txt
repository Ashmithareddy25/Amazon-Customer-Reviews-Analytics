B005L38QK2|5.0|I have changed my Razer Lachesis 4000 dpi for this one and i am very satisfy. It is very more precise when playing FPS game and very comfortable.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|I bought this case from Meijer actually. When I was looking around for some other cases I ran across it out here and decided to write a review. It fits my Kindle Fire just fine. I dont know what happened with the other review on here, but I've been using it with my Fire for a few weeks now. I love it because its hard and durable, its not cheap. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes the elastic in the top corner can come off of my kindle, but i just reapply it. This only happens after constant handing back and forth to my boyfriend, so i will just blame him (: The color is nice as well. Its simple but not super plain. I definetly recommend this case, its a great value and isnt that expensive for a nice quality case.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I absolutely do not understand the person who reviewed this film as boring, because before the opening credits even begin this movie has you on the edge of your seat.  Ryan Gosling's depth as an actor shows through in this gritty crime drama, portraying a man of few words in a world where actions speak volumes.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a silent film by any stretch, but the brooding character Ryan Gosling plays offers much more than empty banter.  This is an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end, the extreme and graphic violence in this film is unsettling but not out of place in order to tell the story, in other words, not thrown in just for the shock value. It has a much deserved R rating for the violence depicted in the film. The action sequences and car chases are excellent.  I was hooked from the get go, and highly recommend it. This is absolutely not a family friendly film, it is for adults only, which I personally appreciate.  While there is nothing wrong with a good \\"family\\" film, there is also a place for films like this one, and I highly recommend it.

0375842381|5.0|The Golden Compass is by far the best of the three, we're introduced to young Lyra, we get to see her world and how it differs from ours. The story is very intelligently written and expressed in very vivid detail. The storyline is grand and suspenseful, and (especially if you saw the movie first) the ending is quite a bit different than expected. the characters are vividly drawn, and rich in detail and resonance. I did see the movie first which inspired me to start reading the series, but the more I read the books I find the cast was expertly cast. Sam Elliot was perfect for the role of Lee Scorsby and Dakota Blue Richards' portrayal of Lyra was spot-on. but this is a review of the book not the movie. I found this one hard to put down,and if read as a fantasy epic adventure it works flawlessly. On the subject of religion, which is where most of the criticism comes from, there are times I agree with the portrayal, and other times I found myself wondering what was the purpose behind how it was portrayed. But, there are a few points in the overall story that didn't seem to pan out for me. But, again, overall it's a great series and an excellent addition to my book collection. I loved the relationships between the characters and the way the author had of showing each character's true nature. It all centers around Lyra, and it seems by their reactions to her, they tend to be defined. Much like your enjoyment of this series is how well you relate to or understand the central heroine. Fortunately she's not one dimensional like so many other child characters in books these days. She has many facets and many personal changes throughout the course of the series. I keep seeing this series compared to Lord of the Rings or the Chronicles of Narnia, while I can see that to some degree, this series stands on its own. Like Lord of the Rings Pullman gives rich full details on the characters and the enviroment. You find yourself immersed in this little universe as if it were your very own. Sometimes he tends to give us too much detail, but that's fine. It never takes away from the overall story or mood. But whereas The Chronicles of Narnia was replete with Christian imagery and allegory, this one is the opposite. I am not sure if it's anti-church or anti-God (as it's been accused of being) but rather a distancing from all the things that interfere with the lives and journeys of the individual. You get the feeling he is saying that heaven is within us, good or bad is within us, you don't need to look for internal sources to govern your lives look inside of yoursel. Religion has been known to get in the way of clear thinking. There are occasions when the chuch seems to stray from it's intent and message, and there are times when people spend too much time preparing for or thinking about the afterlife that very little thought is given to the life we have now, and if there is an overall theme to the series it might be that, the greatest journeys are the ones we take within ourselves. That this life, this time we are in now, is the most precious. But, regardless of the religious or anti-religous overtones and underpinnings this is a great story with great characters and surprising events. This is a great way to start the series.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife is my second favorite, and introducds Will to the story arch. While I like Will and find his character well though out, it bothers me that Lyra, who up until now was braver and stronger and more clever than any adult she knew male or female, was suddenly helpless (at times) and needed to be saved/rescued or helped by the male character. The reason this bothers me is there are so few strong female characters out there, and even less who are created by men, who are totally self-sufficient and strong. Why would Lyra all of a sudden play second stringer to a boy when her own actions and plans worked so well for her in the past? It just makes me feel as if they are saying that it's better if the man makes the decisions and protects the girl. It's a little too old fashioned for me. But, the saving grace is the relationship that develops between the two, as Lyra is getting older her thoughts are changing along with her body, she's becoming aware of herself as a woman, albeit a young woman, and that is juxtapositioned against this backdrop of saving the universe, or the multiverse and herself as well. I find the relationship between them to be real, they only know each other a short while, but their experiences together, and the fact that they are about the same age, helps them to bond, and children of that age are more trusting, but at the same time selective about their friends, but when they do find a friend, they tend to be loyal and caring. this opens up a whole new world for Lyra, while she's always had help, now she has an equal. the side story of Mary Malone though never quite does anything for me, and while it seems like there is a buildup, it never actually delivers. But overall a great book, and a page turner.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass is my least favorite, but that isn't to say it's bad, or unreadable, but just like the Last Battle in the Narnia Series, it leaves you feeling a little unsettled as if some of the pieces aren't actually fitting together as nicely as they should. While the story is grand in scope and still strongly sculpting the character and the story arch. There are times, you are left wondering: What was the point in that? The whole war with the Autority and the demise of the God-like Creature seems a little anti-climactic. A lot of people might lose interest here simply because of what it seems to be implying about God and religion. But, I feel that if you are strong in your faith and truly believe in what you believe then no fictional story, no matter what the intent was behind the metaphors, should be threatening to you. It simply should be read as an epic fantasy story, and not be taken so seriously. Like I stated though I found myself asking, what was that all about more? than actually getting offended or discusted by the metaphorical references. full disclosure, I am a firm believer in God but not a fan of organized religion but I do not criticize anyone who finds solace in the chuch. But at this point in the story, you already know there is a bit of an anti-authority vibe flowing through the story, and it's simply part of the mood/plot. I did wonder what it was Mary was supposed to do or say that was to be the temptation that Lyra was supposed to either give into or spurn. They were portraying her as the new EVE, and that Mary was the serpent in the garden but I never quite figured out what it was that she was supposed to do. And again it seemed like the plot was building up to something at the end of the story but it just seemed to go on for a long time without actually going anywhere (much like the Last Battle) But the tale of self-sacrifice and parting of friends and lovers more than makes up for the misfires I would like to see what happens to Lyra when she gets older and wouldn't mind seeing a reunion of sorts with all the characters. The bond between Lyra and Iorek is a pretty interesting one, and I feel that it wouldn't lessen due to time. So that would be interesting to see. I didn't like the fact that Lyra lost the ability to use the alethiometer after she had finished her mission, it was something that made her special, and it's like sad to see her lose the ability and now she has to relearn it, I guess it shows character development as it shows that originally she was a smart girl but wasn't very keen on learning, yet she was wise in other ways. But now she is shown the importance of learning and the benefits and rewards of studying. Overall I'm very happy to have found this series, and look forward to the chance to read more. So hopefully that will happen sometime soon.cisions and protects the girl. It's a little too old fashioned for me.

B000YEUUCK|4.0|Hi, first of all, I'm no big fan of c. dion. i'm fan of music. This may be a 5 star but I dont think it's that perfect because live music is never as good as studio versions, however this concert is very well recorded, unlike other concerts i've heard on surround, this one has the voice on the center and the instruments on the rest so background music comes from the back speakers and so on. that's a very good thing to enyou music because most of the concerts in surroud they only have the surround channels to play the echoes of the venue, who wants that? So this is good, if you like celine dion and have a surround sound system, get this. Thanks.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|When I discovered a.Bible app with optional audio reading, it was like manna from heaven. I thought I found the one app I needed to study and succeed in my annual Bible reading. It would be great to listen whilst washing dishes or other housework, then pickup reading where the audio left off. So far so good. However the reading piece of the User interface is uncomfortable. Each chapter is a down scrolling single page of content, it is weird that I cannot tap the right side of the screen to turn pages as on most reading apps....and the navigation arrow buttons are just bad design.  So i love love love the audio portion of this app, but i still use the Olive Tree BibleReader when I switch to reading. PLEASE fix the reading UI and I will boost my rating freon three to five stars.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I haven't been so drawn in by a story and its characters in a long time, so for this to happen for this book shows you just how much I loved it. From beginning to end I was drawn into the story, I felt the fear that Anastasia felt and was just as confused by her with some of Mr Grey's \\"issues\\". I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy, and have already told all of my friends who love to read that this is a must for them.

When they open one and find video tapes from when the girls were kids they decide to play one.  I need to begin by saying I don't scare easy.  I can count on one hand the amount of movies that have actually scared me.  The original \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is one of them.  I laughed at \\"Blair Witch\\" but something about the first one really creeped me out.  The second movie wasn't that creepy and only made me tense because of the first one.  Going in I was already a little tense and the longer the movie went on the more tense I became. By the end I was in a little ball.  Other then that embarrasing reveal there is really not much else to say.  If you have seen the other movies you will know what to expect.  If you haven't seen the others watch those first.  Overall, very creepy and almost as good as the first one. I give it a B+

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|\\"I want you to fight for me. That's all I ever wanted.\\" Charlie Kenton (Jackman) is a former boxer who is now involved in the world of robot boxing. After making a bet that his robot can win a match at a rodeo he is once again in the hole to someone. When he is told that his ex has died and he is now in charge of his 11 year old son he finds a way to pay people back. When his son finds a old robot that he fixes up Charlie's outlook changes. This is a movie that is hard to review. On one hand (for me at least) it was pretty sappy and felt like a remake of \\"Rocky 4\\". On the other hand this is a great family movie that younger boys will love. The action was very good and the boxing was fun to watch. The dialog and story were pretty cheesy but in terms of a family movie they fit. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you are looking for a manly boxing movie with lots of fighting and action then you may be disappointed. If you are looking for a family movie to watch with your son then this is what you want. Overall, a good movie for families. I give it a B.
8186336141|5.0|I purshed this book based on other customer feedback on Amazon and I was not dissapointed. If you need one comprehensive book on Yoga i.e. Asanas then this is it. It is very detailed including the medical benefits of and effects of doing a specfic Asana.  However if you purchase other books by the Author you can expect some duplication, maybe even the same language e.g. I purchased the book on Kriya Yoga by the same author and looked like a partial transpose fromthis book.  Over all a weel written book and a must have for anyone considering Yoga / even a reference.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Arguably the best X-Men movie to date if you like a story with substance. This one focuses on how it all began with two different perspectives of the future good and bad X-Men leaders, Xavier and Lensherr, who started as good friends and are then split emotionally over their differences at the end of the film. Good themes about isolation and not fitting in amidst the Cold War period. The cast is bad a** with James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, Michael Fassbender, Oliver Platt and the icy January Jones. Uncredited Cameo by Hugh Jackman as Woleverine. The 2011 Scream Awards gave this one Best Fantasy Movie. X-Men fans should be happy with this one even though there are some minor nitpickings. One of the better emotional scenes was how Xavier loses the use of his legs. The budget for this film was $160M and reared in over $353M at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: December 2011; BEST DIALOGUE (SPOILERS): Professor Charles Xavier: [to Eric] There's so much more to you than you know, not just pain and anger. There's good in you too, and you can harness all that. You have a power that no one can match, not even me. //// Dr. Moira MacTaggert: You know, one day the government is going to realize that how lucky they were to have Professor X on their side. Professor Charles Xavier: I suppose I am a real professor, aren't I? Next thing you know, I'll be going bald. We're still on the government side, Moira. We're still G-Men. Just without the \\"G\\". Dr. Moira MacTaggert: No. You're your own team now. It's better. You're X-Men. Professor Charles Xavier: Yes, I like the sound of that. /// [a deflected bullet fired by Moira towards Erik hits Charles] Erik Lehnsherr: [to Charles] I am so sorry. Erik Lehnsherr: [Erik looks at Moira] YOU! You did this! [Erik begins to strangle Moria with her necklace. Raven, Hank, Alex, and Sean walks toward Erik in order tostop him] Erik Lehnsherr: [Erik to the others approaching] I SAID BACK OFF! [Erik throws Hank, Alex, and Sean into the air leaving Raven on the ground] Professor Charles Xavier: Wait, please. She didn't do this, Erik. You did. [Erik releases Moira] Erik Lehnsherr: [Erik speaks pologetically towards Charles] Us turning on each other, it's what they want. I tired to warn you, Charles. I want you by my side. We're brothers, you and I. All of together, protecting each other. We want the same thing. Professor Charles Xavier: My friend. I'm sorry, but we do not. //// Charles Xavier: Mother. What are you...

B00005T30L|4.0|Ghost World is the anti-teen movie in that it perfectly captures real teen life.  Most ironic thing:  The fact that Enid is an artist who keeps flunking art classes.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />I find period pieces to be a very intriguing genre of film. They depict a past that I'll never know. But if I'm lucky, the really good ones will manage to transcend the times and live on as a sort of cultural imprint throughout the rest of history. David Fincher did this for the most in 2007's Zodiac, in which he showed audiences the captivation and obsession of the Zodiac Killer saga through the eyes of Robert Graysmith and how the case affected the lives of many throughout Northern California area in the late '60s and early '70s. However, Zodiac is a period piece with emphasizing more on sleuthing, police procedure, and mystery-solving elements and isn't so much \\"relevant\\" as it is just \\"engrossing.\\" Enter Fincher's next period piece: The Social Network, which follows the accounts about the founding of the social networking behemoth we now know today as Facebook. One night during a presumably harmless conversation between Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his date, Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), the two strike the subject of final clubs, which would then lead to a rather harsh breakup and serve as the sole catalyzing moment that would lead to the evolution of said social network. Fast forward to a legal hearing in the present day where Zuckerberg is giving depositions for the lawsuit against him from the likes of his once best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), and supposed \\"intellectual theft victims\\" Cameron and Tyler [the] Winklevoss [twins] (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence). Meanwhile, there are various jumps throughout the rest of the film depicting other events, including a meeting with one Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), about all the drama and deceit in-between, and its bitter aftermath for the people involved.<br /><br />I know, it sounds weird; this movie was released in 2010 and I'm already calling it a \\"period piece.\\" But I believe this film has accomplished the extremely rare feat of solidifying itself as an instant classic way before its place in hitory has even been determined yet. It's difficult to say just how far the Information Age will progress. Fifteen years ago, I don't think anyone would've expected smart phones, computers, and the Internet to develop as quickly they have, let alone the mere existence of a concept like social networking. But it all goes beyond technology. The Social Network also represents the feelings, attitudes, and demeanor of an age where people can now get by, not just with tech-savvy knowledge, but through something even more valued by these times: social status. In particular, social status and its exclusivity. It's become a harsh, but often forgotten, fact of life that what you know will not always get you somewhere in life, but also who you know. Throughout the film, despite Zuckerberg's \\"punk rage\\" and \\"rebel cause\\" to take a concept like exclusivity and make it a worldwide phenomenon available to everyone, it also depicts the fast, cold, and cutthroat values capitalist society has come to accept as \\"successful,\\" as evident by all the legal proceedings, arguments of ownership, and constant involvement of money. Even more shocking, it also puts our own values into question with the power to friend, unfriend, or look people up at the simple click of a button. In the end, The Social Network is a timeless masterpiece that will serve as one of the pinnacles of the, now, fb generation and Information Age and serve as a fantastic character study in the coming decades when society has moved to the next big thing.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Shot digitally by Jeff Cronenweth on the Red One MX camera at 4.5K resolution, the video transfer is as sleek and stylish as its script and the clarity as eerily defining as the film's thematic legacy. Much of how I feel the movie itself is a monumental representation of its era and place in history, the cinematography does a stupendous job showing this in parallel. Being a mostly dialogue-driven film, a lot of the shots consist of closeups and static frames that contain very little to no movement by the actors (who are mostly just sitting and talking to each other). But don't let the talk-heavy nature fool you. Despite what little motion there is, it's still very easy to appreciate the lighting, production, and general photography of the all the people, sets, and actions happening within these moments. The color scheme tends to possess a very natural palette that more so reflects the time of day or mood of the situation, but leans a little more towards amber skin tones, greys, browns, and other Fall colors for the overall art direction.<br /><br />Detail is amazing for all its subtleties, crispness, and extremely sharp line quality. Black levels are especially deep with a great deal of delineation in low-lit scenes that help maintain the movie's dark mood, while at the same time providing a very clean and precise presentation. Just look at the opening scene when Zuckerberg is talking to Albright in the crowded college bar. Even amidst all the smoke, haze, and dim lights, the picture is proficiently sharp. Contrast picks up in a matter of minutes when Zuckerberg gets back to his dorm and starts programming, with everything from the curls in his hair to the individual smears of marker from the algorithm written on the window being clearly visible. Subsequently, later shots in the movie (specifically the Ruby Skye VIP room) will display some deeper, more vibrant colors. At any rate, the film has an enormous amount of detail in just about every shot (even the dark ones), which is especially easy to appreciate with all the closeups, and should come as no surprise as to why it rightfully received its Oscar nomination for cinematography.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />As low-key as the movie might seem in terms of audio potential (a character drama about the creation of Facebook with lots of dialogue), you wouldn't think the sound design would be all that great. I mean, it's a lot of code speak, keyboards clacking, and vocal reverberation in a bunch of dorm and deposition rooms, right? Not the case. As unremarkable as the audio may appear on the surface, this is quite the understated sound design that really does more than it should thanks to the mastery of subtlety by sound mixer Ren Klyce and the musical genius of composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whom I really have to praise for their Oscar-winning score. The music simply drives the film's overall sound mix by creating a great deal of ambiance and an electronic tone reflective of the movie's theme to really keep the audience in to things. Particularly, the piece \\"In Motion\\" when Zuckerberg goes on his drunken hacking spree, has a lot of bass and rhythm to it that really gives the surround sound system a nice work out and contributes an \\"engaging\\" to the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Directionality and separation of sound effects and ambient noise are crisp and clear from the front and rear speakers. The opening scene in the bar is just one of the many examples where you can hear a lot of the subtle sounds of people talking, glasses clattering, doors opening, and furniture moving all over the place. Or, even in quieter scenes like where Zuckerberg throws a bottle cap across his desk; a chicken clucking in the background when Zuckerberg is talking to Saverin; the grandfather clock ticking in the background of the Winklevoss' dorm; the door bell at the summer house in California; all of these are subtle in presentation, yes, but the quality and architecture of it all and the fact that it mixes so well with the music is what's outstanding. And then there's the bass. The Ruby Skye VIP room is by far one of the loudest scenes in a movie I've ever watched on BD. The bass is so insanely deep, my wireless keyboard literally fell off my couch by the end of the scene, which has only happened in two or three other instances. So yes, the audio is deceptively reference.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)<br />In another great commentary by Fincher, he starts off in detail about the casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara and how he sort of fell upon them with just a little bit of exposure. He then talks about how the shots of Harvard were actually filmed at Johns Hopkins with the occasional matte painting insert because Harvard was being uppity about filming on their actual campus. He also talks about a number of other topics such as: realism in the technicality of actual typing/programming and how it was all just blue screen that later had the text typed up to match the actions of the actors, the omniscient presence of The Phoenix Club and the kind of \\"mysticism\\" that came with its name, the awesomeness of Josh Pence and his ability to pick up a lot of the physical mannerisms that Armie Hammer had created while they worth both playing the Winklevoss twins, how the Bill Gates in the movie is actually the official Bill Gates impersonator (whom I honestly thought WAS Gates when I first saw him), the 3 distinct musical forms of the main theme and how each one represented a different aspect of transition in the plot, the casting of Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker because of his innate ability to channel a form of \\"executive charisma\\" required for the character, how they couldn't shoot at the actual Ruby Skye club, and many other anecdotal stories or explanations pertaining to themes of the film. This is a must-listen for fans.<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin; Actors Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, and Josh Pence)<br />This track isa lot more jovial than Fincher's, but also contains a wealth of information and trivia. It's funny to hear Sorkin talking about how he wrote the whole movie and how the script looked on paper, but then couldn't understand a single word of what Eisenberg was saying in the context of things like the code speak or deposition lines. He also talks about some of the script/screenplay changes they made, how they ended up casting some of the actors, and then shooting logistics. Eisenberg talks a lot about his portrayal of Zuckerberg, the chemistry he tried to build with Garfield, about his sister and how he used her as a little bit of inspiration for the role, and points out the fact the costuming was all taken from actual photos of the real people. Garfield, Hammer, and Pence interject here and there with some great anecdotes about shooting the movie and the research they did in preparing for their characters. Timberlake doesn't get a whole lot of time, but he does a good job telling how he landed the role of Parker and the kind of character he wanted to portray in relation to, not so much the authenticity of the history, but for the movie itself and how everything would work out thematically by the end. If you like the movie, I highly recommend you give this track a listen to compliment Fincher's.<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />Note: It is not a typo that I kept all the featurette titles in lower case, they were all lower case on the extras menu in Facebook font. I thought it looked cool and am trying to preserve it here as my own personal quirk.<br /><br />- how did they ever make a movie of facebook? (HD; 1:32:43)<br />The following featurettes pretty much cover the entire production of the movie itself showing how they shot some scenes on location, CG'd some others, did the whole Winklevoss twins look with two actors but only one of their faces, the various different angles they used for editing, and even have some pretty insightful comments from cast and crew throughout. The four segments are as follows:<br /><br />- commencement (7:56)<br />Talks a lot about the 3-week rehearsal they had and the kind of mood they wanted to establish in the delivery of the script and how those lines could best be achieved through the characters. It wasn't so much about learning what to say, but how to say it and effectively set the atmosphere with the dialogue from the get-go.<br /><br />- boston (29:19)<br />Starts off with Eisenberg talking about the filming experience and how it was a little easier to do this than what he's done in theater. Also takes a look at how they shot the opening bar scene from two cameras to capture the speed of the conversation so they could make the multiple angles for the final cut. Eisenberg then goes on to talk about his character portrayal of Zuckerberg showing a little footage of he, Fincher, Garfield, and Sorkin in a meeting to further break down some the underlying themes of the story. Of most interest, though, is the work that went behind the Winklevoss twins. It shows the preparation taken to cast both Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, the computer trick they used in grafting Hammer's face onto Pence's body, the training they underwent for the rowing sequences, and the difficulty in eating a lot of hamburgers when doing as many takes as Fincher likes to do.<br /><br />- los angeles (26:01)<br />Starts off by showing the Bill Gates speech rehearsal, then shows the pool scene, how it was shot, and has a little opinion from Eisenberg about why that particular scene didn't agree with him and who he thought Zuckerberg was being portrayed as. Then, there's a little blurb about Sorkin and how he loves to write screenplays and dialogue, but not so much a plot. Next, is a look at Timberlake and his reflection on playing Parker and how he wanted to point out certain details about his character, as well as the irony of playing Parker who basically ruined the music industry he was once a part of. Next, they take another lookat the work that went into the Winklevoss twins' performances, specifically how each one of them fed off the others' work and incorporated said quirks as their own. And finally, we get an interpretation from various cast and crew about the themes of ambition, its power to corrupt, and how it ultimately affected the friendship of Zuckerberg and Saverin.<br /><br />- the lot (30:02)<br />This segment has more visual exposition just showing how things were shot with a little bit of commentary in-between from the actual set, rather than showing something and having cuts of interviews in front of the camera to go with it. While there's not a whole lot of information being given from anyone in particular, I find it fascinating to see the whole process carry out from something of a voyeuristic viewpoint as a natural flow of things instead of the usual retrospective they give after the fact. Around the last third of the feature, however, they start to add more interview-esque commentary about the overall experience of the film itself, their general feelings of the characters and writing, and how good of a finished product they ended up making. It's a nice way to cap things off, as I feel it really shows all the hard work they put into it.<br /><br />- jeff cronenweth and david fincher on the visuals (HD; 7:48)<br />Both men go into detail about shooting the film digitally and how the Red One camera does such a great job capturing a wider color spectrum and even the smallest amount of lighting from on-set fixtures. They also talk about how Fincher shot Zodiac and Benjamin Button on the Thomson VIPER Filmstream camera, and how he sort of helped pioneer the use of digital cameras in film-making in general.<br /><br />- angus wall, kirk baxter, and ren klyce on Post (HD; 17:24)<br />I'm particularly amazed at the amount of editing Wall and Baxter did. They had 268 hours of footage and different-angled shots that had to be cut down to a 2-hour movie. They give an example by showing about a dozen takes of Zuckerberg saying, \\"If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook,\\" and of Saverin saying, \\"I was your only friend.. you had one.. friend,\\" just to show how every performance on each individual take can vary and that capturing the right kind of emotion is key to making the scene \\"feel\\" that much more connecting. Meanwhile, Kylce talks about the sound design and how Fincher wanted him to take a lot of the important dialogue scenes and crank up the ambient noise and effects to full volume so that audiences would be forced to listen carefully. They show us a couple of examples in the various versions of the opening bar scene and the Ruby Skye club. They give us a dialogue-only, a noise/ambience-only mix, then the final product of each. This is easily my favorite extra on the entire collection, and I highly recommend it to those who are interested in technicalities of film-making.<br /><br />- trent reznor, atticus ross, and david fincher on the score (HD; 18:55)<br />Reznor and Ross are basically in a giant room with a bunch of synthesizers, keyboards, and other instruments with Reznor doing all the performing and Ross mixing all those sounds together to make music. Reznor points out that he wanted to make the soundtrack more like something you can just listen to as music, as opposed to music that accompanies a scene. Fincher then discusses the film's main themes (\\"Hand Covers Bruise\\") and how there are 3 different versions to symbolize the progression of Zuckerberg's character. They then show us how the theme changes between the beginning, middle, and end of the movie. It's a very insightful look at the music and I'm really glad that Fincher or whoever put this together realizes the importance of how a good score can really affect a movie.<br /><br />- in the hall of the mountain king: music exploration<br />This is more of an audio exposition with comparisons between the first and final drafts of the track itselfand how it looked in the finished shot. In the previous feature, Reznor and Ross talk about how it was a fairly easy process to make the actual score for the rest of movie outside of this piece. For this one, they spent about 3 straight weeks working on it and were figuratively ready to just kill themselves when they finally finished it.<br /><br />- swarmatron (HD; 4:28)<br />A short look at one of the instruments used for the music. It's basically a big strip that you can run your finger on and make a different number of sounds on with varying pitches. But there are also a bunch of knobs that can combine and separate the sounds into one or many different other pitches. Some of the sounds were kind of ethereal, while others were a bit creepy. Interestingly enough, the machine needs a key to turn it on.<br /><br />- ruby skye vip room: multi-angle scene breakdown<br />This is an interesting look at how they planned and filmed the entire scene of the conversation at the club. It actually has 4 different segments that can either be viewed individually or as a composite view where all 4 of them are open in their own window and whichever box you've highlighted will play its audio. I couldn't get the time stamps down, as each chapter said it was only about 3 minutes, but then the title time said the whole thing was around 19 minutes, which just doesn't add up. But here are the 4 views, anyway:<br /><br />- rehearsal<br />- interviews<br />- tech scout<br />- principal photgraphy<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />The Social Network is an amazing film. It's a period piece and character drama about rebellion, ambition, betrayal, the driving forces of our society, and the innocence lost in all that mess. It's more than just about how Facebook was made, it's a commentary on the what happened because of Facebook, how all the people involved were affected, the decisions they made, the philosophical issues raised, and how we, as a society, can relate to that, be it directly orindirectly, whether we use Facebook or not. Regardless, though, Sony has a winner here with reference quality A/V specs and lot of great special features. This is definitely a must-own movie and a cinematic gem that will surely stand the test of time throughout the years to come.

B00000DQR4|5.0|This box set tells a full story of The Smashing Pumpkins in a very small, and amazingly designed, box.<br /><br />Alternative versions of great songs and \\"smashing\\" covers of other artists' great songs, all done with that certain spin that only The Pumpkins can add.<br /><br />This set was purchased to replace a dear friend's set that he sold a few years ago, to get through some financial hardships.  This did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do.  His jaw dropped open and tears of joy swelled in his eyes.  It is the reaction one wants when giving a present and it is that feeling inside, when you give that kind of a gift, that makes something like this so incredible.<br /><br />If you do not like The Smashing Pumpkins, then don't buy this.  If you, or a loved one or friend, are a fan, then you cannot pass on this set.  SP are an important factor in the history of modern music.
0307959856|1.0|Just a brief note to say that after reading many P.D. James novels, and, of course, all of Jane Austen's wonderful novels, this book will seem sad, flat, and disappointing to many - well especially to me I suppose.  Without wishing to slight P.D. James in any way because many of her previous books have so delighted and entertained me, I must report that this novel is fails in many ways.  Furthermore, reading such a work slightly colours your feelings about the actual Pride and Prejudice characters even though you know it is just a modern and rather irrelevant addition.  Thus I would have to say, treasure Pride and Prejudice, treasure P.D. James, and avoid this book.

0393338398|2.0|I read reviews that claimed this story was great for those who are not baseball fans. I wish I could agree. I'm not particularly a baseball fan, but wanted to know what all the hype about this book (and movie) was all about. I liked the first few chapters, but then very quickly got bogged down in unfamiliar references and statistics. I hate to not finish a book, and I tried for days to get through to the end, though it started to seem very repetitive mid-way through and my eyes began to gloss over the pages without enthusiasm. Ultimately, I gave up a few chapters short of the end. Just not enough here to keep my interest. I think I'll just watch the movie to find out the end.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the app is simple and a great time waster. the only thing I dislike is the fact that the controls are slow and it makes it hard to move.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|the movie is great.. there are plenty of movie reviews letting you know how people liked this movie. I've always loved it and wanted to get it on blu-ray. Unfortunately the blu-ray version is pathetic. the dvd version almost looks better. grainy picture, sounds \\"ok\\". Those are the two things you look for being spectacular in a blu-ray and they do not deliver.  -I guess this just makes it obvious that some moves were never shot or made to go to high-def. If that is the case.. just don't make a blu-ray version then. I already own the movie, now I own it twice in what I feel is the same quality. So if your the person that's doing a slow conversion over to blu-ray of your favorite movies, you might want to skip this one unless it goes on sale for like $5. I paid $10 so its not a total bust.  5 stars for the movie.. 1 star for the blu-ray

B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about the Hunger Games trilogy, I was skeptical and even a bit angry, since the plot as it was described to me sounded identical to Battle Royale, which I have counted among my favorite novels for years.  After a few days, I decided to read and judge the book for myself, and I'm certainly glad that I did.  While the setup for the titular game of survival is quite similar to that of Battle Royale, there is enough original material here that Suzanne Collins could have easily reached those similarities by coincidence.  Overall, the tone of Hunger Games is quite different than Battle Royale.  Koushun Takami's 1999 Battle Royale feels like sociological horror, with all of its gore and shock value squarely focused on Japanese-centric commentary about youth in a dog-eat-dog, adult-controlled world with no room for individual freedoms.  By comparison, Hunger Games feels life a life-or-death adventure, where both you and lead character Katniss Everdeen must remind yourselves that all of her grand experiences are still leading towards one inevitable point, a fight to the last survivor against other youth just like her.  The Hunger Games actually holds more in common with the film version of Battle Royale, which most fans of the novel feel is vastly inferior to the original.  That's not to say that Hunger Games fails on the same points as the film, just that the two intellectual properties are actually quite different, and both still draw inspiration from material that far preceeded them, such as Stephen King's The Running Man and The Long Walk, or even Nineteen Eighty-Four before that.  In his review, King even drew similar comparisons, and while he agreed that Collins' novel was a compelling read, he gave the novel a \\"B\\" due to his criticism of her rapid-fire writing style (which he deemed \\"authorial laziness\\" when certain details got brushed aside by the quick pace of the narrative).  I tend to disagree with this assessment.  If one of Collins' qualitiesis to be commended, it's her ability to write in a cinematic fashion, giving the greatest attention and detail to the parts of the story she knows the reader will care about, while generally refusing to get bogged down in boring exposition.  This works to her advantage in most cases, since the story is told from Katniss' perspective, and Collins' cinematic writing conveys a sense of where Katniss' awareness is most acutely directed.  It also means that The Hunger Games could make a rare smooth transition to the big screen, as the film adaptation is due to hit theaters on March 23rd.  I would wager that, by this time next year, the entertainment market will be flooded with blu-rays, DVDs, video games, graphic novels, soundtrack CDs, and all sorts of connected merchandise, a phenomenon which is increasingly evident if you search \\"Hunger Games\\" here on Amazon.  Regardless of how you may feel about Collins' inspiration for the book, Hunger Games is definitely a triple-A franchise with a chance to make more people continue reading literature, just as Harry Potter and Twilight have managed to do over the last decade, though Hunger Games will no doubt hold more interest for mature readers than either of those series.

0143039830|5.0|I first stumbled upon the NYT when I was in college, over 20 years ago.  I found it in a secondhand bookshop and picked it up, never having heard of Paul Auster. The chance encounter is something right out of the novels themselves.  I read the whole thing in a weekend and I've thought about it, off and on, ever since.  Don't look for some revelatory solution: just read it to see what questions it asks.

I have 30 to 40 more to go not sure what my correct weight will be but I think i will know it when I see it!!  Mostly interested in getting my middle down which somehow grew.....

0062059882|5.0|This novel was at once wonderful and frustrating from the very beginning. It has great ideas and is well written. The characters are rich and bring the reader into a private circle. There are mysteries and puzzles that keep the reader involved from page one to the final word. The worst part about this book was that I read it first having not known of the original. It was a gift from a huge Gaiman fan and i didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't know the writter or the original book. Once I finished this version, I immediately went to the local library and read the original over a weekend. Now that I am a fan myself I can honestly say that I like this version better. The bad part about all of this is that I now must go forth and find more by Mr. Gaiman because that is what fans do... I hope everyone gives this book and chance!

0062060554|5.0|Imagine waking up and not recognizing your face. This is Chritine's life. She lost her memory after an accident but if that wasn't enough, she also suffers from short term memory. So everyday when she wakes up, she's forgotten what happened yesterday.<br /><br />If you watch the Drew Barrymore's movie Fifth First Dates you'll have an idea of what this book is about.<br /><br />Why doesn't Christine recognize her own face? Because the last memory she has of her face is from she was young and now she is.... old.<br /><br />What would you do to remember who you are? Well, Christine is keeping a diary. For some reason, everyday when she wakes up she goes to this shoe box and finds her diary and reads it. That's how she knows she is not insane and can wave together yesterday's events to today's. Everyday, she adds that day's important events to the diary. And that is how she can \\"remember\\" who is whom.<br /><br />The problem? Christine is married and she is suspecting her husband... of something. What exactly she doesn't know but she doesn't trust him anymore.<br /><br />I was totally taken with this book. My mind can't just process how a person can live with short term memory or not memory at all.<br /><br />I was totally immersed in the story and found it brilliant. I hope they make a movie out of this book because it will really be a good movie.
0671449028|1.0|I LOVE the 'Barnyard Dance' and have been on the lookout for more Boynton that is also rhythmic and silly without some poignant message of some sort (see the poor left-out hippo).  I like the Going to Bed Book - except for the exercise part (just like all other reviewers here, even the 5-start ones).  I thought - you know, maybe the author would consider deleting those two pages from this otherwise perfect book!  Well - apparently her and her -sister? sister-in-law? daughter? mother?...someone with the same last name -  are so convinced of their perfection that she (the unknown family member) very kindly responded that there would be no such possibility since 'oddly, after all these years, the book continues to be a best-seller'.  Wow - I applaud her success, but will definitely not contribute to it any longer - here ends my search for rhythmic Boynton!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|This movie is one of the best I have seen in a long time. I am familiar with European cinema, so the style was not a surprise to me. I loved the characters, the music, the settings and the story. While the people around me looked puzzled I was drinking in the Grimm references, and recognizing places I have traveled. One reviewer said the Grimm FairyTales were evident but not used directly and I must disagree. The entire movie is a modern day fable, true to the Brothers Grimm. A wicked witch who wants to kill the beautiful princess who has been raised away from civilization. Sleeping Beauty, anyone? Or Rapunzel if you like. The casting is exquisite and I adored seeing Cate Blanchett as a villain, her Texas accent was priceless! I believed Eric Bana as Papa and cried for him. Ms. Ronan is spectacular. Did they write the part for her, or was she born to play it? Who knows?  The film is a visual, aural and mental treat. I never had the chance to see it in the theatre, but when we rented the disk, immediately watched it twice and truly loved it the second time more than the first. The music like the main characters is ethereal and lightning fast, applied with a restrained hand. I can listen to the album anytime and be thrilled.  I do understand some of the negative comments, but they sadden me. If you have only watched TV and Hollywood \\"Blockbusters\\" you are accustomed to a MacDonald's level movie experience. There is nothing wrong with MacDonald's from time to time, but not every day. \\"Hanna\\" is a fiercely fine sharp cup of black coffee with a fresh pastry taken in the open air. It is a treat the we each deserve at least once in our lives.  Please give this movie and chance and enjoy!
B004289ZW0|5.0|Used one of these remote GPS devices in my friend's plane during a sixteen hour flight. We navigated the entire trip using foreflight on an iPad and this receiver.  The accuracy was fantastic and I could not notice any delay in update speed. To top it off, when I went to purchase my own personal receiver, the price had dropped considerably. I highly recommend this device for any pilot on a budget.

B004KA9MQO|5.0|So many times we are persuaded to think so much about others that we forget to be good to ourselves. In the process we lose all of what makes us who we are as an individual, and have to rely on what others think about us to understand our place in the world. On Jennifer Hudson's new album I REMEMBER ME we see that she is going back to the basics and realizes the importance of loving and appreciating herself.<br /><br />From beginning to end we are taken along a journey where Ms. Hudson helps the listener to see that what may have worked in the past doesn't do it for her now, and it is ok to think about what matters to us personally. There is also the spiritual side of I REMEMBER ME that puts the focus on where she gets her strength.<br /><br />It's hard to listen to this album and not think about what a rollercoaster she has been on over the past five years, but as the album title reminds us this is what makes her the force that she is today.

0312641893|5.0|The new young adult book \\"Cinder\\" gives the story of Cinderella a postapocalyptic twist that is imaginative and fresh. Taking the popular fairy tale and converting its well-known elements into futuristic equivalents make this retelling stand out from the rest.<br /><br />Living as a cyborg in New Beijing, Cinder struggles every day to gain acceptance from her adopted family, as well as the people around her. Cyborgs aren't the only things troubling this future world. The plague, for which there is no cure, is popping up all over the city, and the mysterious Lunar queen is plotting her next move. Through a chance meeting with Prince Kai at her mechanic shop, Cinder learns about her own shadowed past and her role in Earth's future.<br /><br />Cinder is an exciting heroine who can look out for herself. And because of the cruelty of her stepmother, she has been doing just that. But, in spite of her stepmother's and stepsister's disdain for her, Cinder finds friendship in her other stepsister, Peony, and android Iko. Add to that an old pumpkin-orange car, and an ill-fitting foot that falls off at a pivotal moment, and you have a redesigned Cinderella with plenty of endearing touches.<br /><br />Among the many things that set this story apart from other retellings is the setting of New Beijing, China, after the fourth world war. Though more nods to the Chinese culture would have added to the depth of the setting, New Beijing is fast-paced and even feels slightly old world with the addition of the emperor and prince as heads of the kingdom.<br /><br />Some readers may be disappointed by the lack of twists and the predictability of the plot. The strong points of the book most certainly lie in its characters and world building. With its ties to science fiction through the cyborg and lunar people element, as well as the base in a fairy-tale retelling, \\"Cinder\\" will appeal to many readers.<br /><br />\\"Cinder\\" is suitable for readers 12 and up. There is no profanity or sexual content, and violence is kept to a minimum. \\"Cinder\\" is part of a quartet, so readers should prepare for an ending that will make them clamor for the next book.\\" is part of a quartet, so readers should prepare for an ending that will make them clamor for the next book.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been a big Apple user and still am. For iPhone I would update my work schedule on the calendar app and liked it for the most part. This app has the upper hand though because getting my work schedule filled out on here is super fast and painless.
B000002GBK|5.0|Each title of this album focuses on one of the characters of the King Arthur legend - except for the final title entitled \\"The Final Battle\\". Wakeman captures his interpretation of the character in each title. For example, 'Merlin the Magician' has some very whimsical parts to it sounding like a player piano playing in a old US Western movie.
B004GGTAQE|3.0|This book was interesting to me as a former armor commander myself. I have read Colonel Hans von Luck's \\"Panzer Commander\\" which tells the story of WW2 combat in the European theater from the command point of view and also Paul Carell's \\"Scorched Earth\\" which gives a detailed overall history of the Russian-German war. This book filled a gap by giving an account of small unit actions (from squad up to company level). Carius was in the heat of battle all the way, and he was a very competent small unit commander.<br />Unfortunately, I cannot honestly give this book a 4 or 5 star rating. There are several reasons. It just seems too dispassionate to me. Just another day at the office, was it? Also, at the time of writing, he was still super pissed-off about the treatment of German soldiers after the war. He overdid that aspect while conveniently overlooking the many horrible things done by the Germans during the war. Finally, his disparagement of the American soldier for lack of aggressiveness in the closing pages seemed small-minded and unnecessary. (That was in the closing weeks of the war when the Americans knew they had won. It was just a matter of time. Why would you press your luck?)<br />In final analysis, this is a good book to read if you are interested in armored action during WW2, especially on the Eastern front. Otherwise, you can give it a skip.<br /><br />(Recommended first person accounts of combat: Company Commander by Charles B. MacDonald, Brazen Chariots by Robert Crisp, and The Heights of Courage by Avigdor Kahalani. All great.)
B002GDM2UA|5.0|The picture quality on this release is about the same, though possibly a tad more smoothed over. I think they might have used a little bit of grain reduction in scenes. This is comparing the releases on a 72 inch DLP. Both are great, but I give the slight edge to the Brit release.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Besides portraying dozens of fictional women-- and one rabbi-- Meryl Streep became Ethel Rosenberg, Julia Child and now Margaret Thatcher. Surely if there is any justice left in Hollywood,  she, just having won the Golden  Globe,  will get an Oscar for her splendid performance as Britain's first and only female prime minister. This movie is not to be missed. While the supporting cast  is superb, particularly Jim  Broadbent as Denis Thatcher in old age, this film  belongs to Streep and Streep alone.  She is in most of the scenes; when she is on screen, it is all about her. There is obviously  no role she cannot play.<br /><br />The film opens with Mrs. Thatcher debilitated with dementia and flashes back to her days as a young woman-- played by another actress-- and then as prime minister of course. In practically one-half of the movie, we see her in the present when she cannot remember that her husband Denis is dead. There is a particularly poignant scene where she is signing books and mistakenly writes \\"Margaret Roberts, \\" her maiden name instead of  \\"Thatcher.\\" For those of us who have had family members with dementia, we recognize immediately that Ms. Streep, sad to say, is perfect as this character-- her gait, her vacant stare, her confusion.  And she has all the fire and steel that we associate with Thatcher in her days as prime minister.<br /><br />While I suspect that Ms. Streep does not share the prime minister's political views, it is easy to see why she chose this role since Mrs. Thatcher, whether you like her or not, had an uphill battle as a woman surrounded by men in government.<br /><br />The riot and protest scenes are riveting as the prime minister often is driven through them. The soundtrack is beautiful. I recognized \\"Casta Diva\\" from NORMA and some Bach also.<br /><br />You will be wrung out at the end of this film but glad you saw it.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|This is what I consider to be Sabbath's last album. After this, there were so many lineup changes, the band basically deteriorated into a Tony Iommi solo project.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I spent quite a lot of time playing Spider Solitaire on my PC, and I was pleased to find this app is very similar.  The only complaint I have is that a tap doesn't always send the card to where I want it, and dragging is required.  A great way to spend some idle time.
B00382X4XC|2.0|Black Sabbath \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is a great cd. But this so called remastered version lacks volume. The cd does not play loud enough to be a great remastered cd. I have lots of remastered cds that play two or three times louder than this cd when played at the same volume when doing a comparison test.

B000002GA8|5.0|Okay, the lyrics are nothing to write home about. They are simple, almost juvenile. Fortunately they are not the main attraction, the music is. The lyrics do tell part of the story, so you should still understand what the singer is saying.  Other than the other story albums of the time, and the more symphonic productions of Yes, the closest album I can think of similar to this in terms of style is The Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Passed\\", which is completely different in concept.  Given the goal of the album, I think that the music is well-matched to the goal, not over-blown or pretentious. However, recall that much symphonic music is by its nature overblown and pretentious. Consider, as an example, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Definitely overblown and pretentious. And who cares? It's good music well done.  As with much of the music I enjoy, this album is not for everyone. It is a niche album for those who like the fusion of rock and classical, with synthesizers and a story thrown in for good measure. There are a variety of styles represented, including Rick Wakeman's unique style. If you are still unsure whether you would like this, borrow a copy or download a portion from someone and give it a listen. If Yes and The Moody Blues are your idea of exciting music, I'm betting this album will soon be on your list of good music.

Simply taking on the idea of translating Verne's classic into symphonic rock was audacious enough but to succeed as well as Wakeman does is pretty extraordinary, considering his age (24) and that he did it solo - with some help from orchestrators.  Apparently this was recorded live because it was cheaper than carting an orchestra and instruments into a studio for a week. The record company was not convinced, but I think the live 'special event' feel really makes the album, and the performances are pretty good from all involved.  Musically, it's brilliant - the main theme is very strong, very simple and very classic but soon the trademark Wakeman synths make their presence felt and thereafter it's a great mix of Moog, electric piano, clavinet, Hammond and orchestra and choir. If there is a letdown it's the choice of vocalists - I keep reading that Ashley Holt is a brilliant singer, but I've yet to hear it. He sounds better suited to this album than others he has collaborated on but he still irritates the pip out of me.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|Posed as a pseudo-documentary, this 09 sci-fi makes some very heavy-handed comments on what happens when minorities must live oppressed by uncaring majorities. The aliens are the weak ones here, and their human oppressors try to relocate them into distant camps like American Indians or WW2 Japanese Americans. Despite the social commentary, this plays quite entertainingly, and is actually a very funny film as we watch the narrator slowly turn into an alien. Lots of violence.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I finished Quell and am almost done with \\"Reflections.\\" I think that if I used hints or YouTube I wouldn't feel the same sense of accomplishment. The more advanced puzzles cannot be solved by accident. I was stuck on the aptly titled \\"dilemma\\" for nearly 2 weeks until I loaded the app one day, looked down at the puzzle and saw the solution - before I even touched the screen. I wanted to pop a champagne cork.  Just because you don't see the solution right away doesn't mean you're dumb... but when you finally get it you'll feel pretty smart. The strategy I use is to find the central problem (sometimes, but not usually there's more than one) and go from there. Avoid the hints and don't stress it. You'll get there.  I also posted this review under discussions because I'd like to hear how others think...
B004P3J4IC|2.0|This album feels like another tossed off Lucinda Williams album. The tracks that seem to have the most effort put into them are the ones that I find the least interesting. Time to go back to the drawing board.
1451648537|5.0|I have been a Apple enthusiast since 2003 when I purchased my first iPod. I watched Steve's Stanford Commencement address in 2005 and was forever changed by his poignant message. I simply had to read this book and learn more about this fascinating entrepreneur. The author did a great job balancing the light and dark of Steve Jobs' remarkable ( and bizarre) life story.  Steve jobs is one of the most brilliant minds of our time. Blessings and peace to Jobs family. Rest in peace Steve.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|this is a good app but for the galaxy nexus you need to turn off 2d rendering in the developer tools section (it is already off by default) for the radar to display properly.  The developer was quick to respond when I reported the problem.
B004ODLUF8|1.0|I have often wondered where to see Hubble images in HD, and in that context, this was a terrible, terrible movie.  How hard could it be to make a film showing whatever it is that the Hubble has been shooting all these years?? Instead, they show the astronauts getting dressed and fooling around, and screwing parts into the both the underwater mock-up and the real Hubble for about 80% of the film.  An incredible waste of time!!  NASA knows how to buy rocket engines from outside vendors, they are world class at exceeding budgets and they really know how to crash stuff on Mars. However, they don't seem to have any desire to make a movie about anything other than their astronaut pals.  I did like the scene where that chief NASA bureaucrat gets berated for canceling the Hubble upkeep mission.  I wish they would have explained how much computer enhancement went into that one scene towards the end of the star cloud - was that all optical? or enhanced? They don't even say.  Jeez!  Note: if you are into astronauts, then this is probably an interesting movie.

1607053888|3.0|This is a nice collection of sweet bags, really good for the beginner.  Because almost all of the projects can be done in quilt-weight cotton it definitely makes it an easier entrance to bag-making than other books.<br /><br />With that said it's definitely designed with ease in mind.  If you want more challenging and much broader bag making details than try Lisa Lam's [[ASIN:071533624X The Bag Making Bible: The Complete Guide to Sewing and Customizing Your Own Unique Bags]].  While the instructions in that title are a little squirrely the projects are much more challenging.<br /><br />Still, a nice little collection to have.

Very disappointed, a piece of trash for my uses. Amazon needs to REMOVE the words CAMCORDER from its description. Only good thing about this unit is it feels durable.

B000FC1MCS|4.0|This was a quick, fun read and an interesting story told by an autistic narrator.  I'm a big fan of the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory and the main character here reminded me a lot of my favorite character Sheldon from the TV show.  I also enjoy math and liked when Christopher talked about his math problems.  I haven't interacted with autistic people as an adult and it was interesting to see the inner workings of this one example of an autistic mind.  I definitely recommend this book.
0891419063|5.0|I was a little skeptical of the praise this work received, especially since it was written so many years after the author's experiences.  But now I will sing the same praises.  This book reveals just why such experiences were so vivid in the author's mind when he wrote it.  Sledge's accounts are real and engaging; I had great difficulty putting the book down when other priorities called.  I also appreciate Sledge's use of notes throughout the book to further explain items without losing the flow of the actual text.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Katniss Everdeen has survived the Arena, but the bizarre ritual of the Hunger Games is far from over. Now, she sets off on a Victory Tour of the twelve Districts, whose citizens are forced to celebrate her triumph, and she must face the neighbors, friends, and families of the opponents she killed and the allies she failed to protect. Katniss discovers her daring rebellion against the Games' supreme rule that only one contestant may survive has sparked revolt among the people of the Districts, and her privileged status as a Victor is not enough to protect her and her loved ones from the wrath of the Capitol. The mere hope of escape from the Capitol's tyranny is the ultimate sin, to be crushed without mercy.<br /><br />Katniss has unwittingly become the symbol of that hope--the Mockingjay, the Girl on Fire, the Girl Who Lived.<br /><br />Where the first volume of Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy centered on Katniss' battle for survival in a world ruled by an evil totalitarian dictatorship, the second volume, Catching Fire, reveals the unintended consequences of her victory in the Hunger Games. Despite the Capitol's best efforts to use her as a pawn in its demoralizing propaganda campaign, Katniss is now the focus of a desperate rebellion, and she quickly learns that to become a revolutionary, even an unwilling one, is to make herself and everyone she holds dear a target for the merciless reprisal of the Capitol, and its wrath will fall first on the most innocent and vulnerable. The danger is real and personal and imminent. There will be sacrifices, and treachery, and blood. It becomes impossible to distinguish between friends and enemies. The only defense is to keep fighting, always fighting, until the end.<br /><br />The story's pace is brisk and urgent, and any readers dismayed by the relatively mild action at its outset will be amply compensated later. Katniss' emotional struggle to choose between her childhood friend Gale and her Arena comrade, Peeta, becomes even deeper and more complicated. We see glimpses of the other Districts and hints of the web of lies woven by the Capitol to keep them in line. Nearly all the characters wrestle with difficult ethical decisions under extreme pressure, and while some of their choices are murky, it's encouraging that they're striving so valiantly to do the right thing in a world that's lost its moral compass.<br /><br />What I found most striking about this story is its perspective on revolution. Despite our national heritage, modern Americans have little appreciation for the very real costs of rebellion against a tyrant. We write catchy pop ballads about starting revolutions and changing the world. We organize marches against authority figures and chant slogans as we throw rocks and bottles. We wear t-shirts bearing the images of \\"revolutionaries\\" unworthy of the title, or bits of uniforms and insignia from the larger, crueler tyrannies they spawned. Catching Fire shows that revolution is a deadly serious thing, and freedom, once lost, is murderously difficult to recover.<br /><br />Catching Fire is a powerful, gripping tale that sustains the momentum of The Hunger Games and ends with a shattering revelation that nicely sets up the third and final volume, Mockingjay. The Capitol government still feels like an anonymous cloud of evil, despite the larger presence of its leader, President Snow, and that's my biggest gripe. Given that the story is written from Katniss' perspective, I expect I'll gain more enlightenment, and satisfaction, on that front when she does.<br /><br />Like the first volume in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire is for older teens and up, mostly due to the violent nature of the Games and the Capitol's brutal tactics. It's a great story for parents and children to read and discuss together. Though depictions of violence are restrained, they are often jarring. No profanity or explicit sexuality. Some alcohol abuse with consequences. Non-sexual cuddling/sleeping together by two characters trying to cope with severe emotional trauma.ng together by two characters trying to cope with severe emotional trauma.

B0043X1FL8|5.0|This film had several Oscar nominations, and rightfully so. Despite failing to win (Dances with Wolves), DeNiro delivered his greatest acting performance to date. Not only was his job masterful in a truly difficult role, but seeing both DeNiro and Williams out of their typical roles was refreshing. It demonstrated how great they truly are. Penny Marshall was also superb.  I highly recommend this movie.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I travel between offices in two states every other week and use a late 2011 13\\" MacBook Pro for my primary business computer.  Over the years I have become accustomed to working on two monitors and decided to the Mini DV port to DVI adapter to allow me to connect to external monitors.  This adapter allows me to quickly and conveniently connect to my monitors at the two different offices.  The monitors are different sizes and resolutions, and I have set up different wallpaper on each.  The adapter allows my computer to automatically recognize which monitor is connected and adjust appropriately.<br /><br />I have not had any problems using adjacent USB ports when this is connected, nor have I had any issues at all.  I know that some people have had problems with certain resolution monitors and demanding uses, but for my general business use this adapter has been fantastic.

0446310786|5.0|Like most Americans, I was first introduced to Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as a high school student. At the time, I had no idea what it was about, nor could I have ever imagined how much this book would come to mean to me. Like other classics of literature, it is still as resonant today as ever.<br /><br />The plot is fairly well-known, but if you aren't aware of it, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a coming-of-age story. Scout Finch is a young girl growing up in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. She spends much of her free time playing with her older brother, Jem, and, during the summer, a neighbor's nephew, Dill. One summer day the three children get the idea to try and get a reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley, to come outside. It becomes a near-obsession for them, but despite their best efforts, Boo remains unseen.<br /><br />The Finch children are raised by their father, Atticus, a widower and a prominent lawyer in the town. He's an unconventional parent at best; his children call him by his first name, and he doesn't seem as concerned with appearances as other parents. However, he is trying to instill in Scout and Jem a sense of honesty and integrity, and this becomes evident when he is assigned to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.<br /><br />Though many educators (my high school English teacher included) have focused on the racism aspect of the story, upon re-reading it many times since, I don't think that is the main focus of the novel. Yes, it is a huge part, but it's almost the backdrop for the events contained therein. This is a story of that moment where the innocence of childhood is lost. It's about the realization that the world is a complicated, sometimes ugly, place. Adults are not infallible, and parents are not granted superpowers. Courage can take curious forms, and those who may seem to be dull can actually be the heroes of a town. Life exists not in simple black and white, but in varying shades of gray. And not every decision that is made by society is necessarily a good one.<br /><br />Fifty years after its original publication, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is as heartwarming and heartbreaking as ever. And that's the mark of a truly classic novel.

Mcglaughlin doesn't get the vibe of Santana's compositions and Mahavishnu plays too technical throughout Carlos's compositions. They're are a few shining moments, mostly Billy Cobham's. I would skip this album when putting your catalog together.

0786939532|2.0|I bought the box set and set out to read book 1 3 days ago. This is my first foray into fantasy since tolkien's LOTR and David eddings' belgariad and mallorean series. Incidentally I love the latter author, preferring his modern take on high fantasy to tolkien's classic.  I'm currently at page 100 and find it hard to continue. The story of drizzt simply doesn't grab me. I couldn't understand why my experience differs from that of 200+ reviewers. After re-reading some sections, I thought I found some clues. For me at least, this book suffers from 1) poor pacing, 2) weak characterization and 3) poor dialogue.  1) i guess being the first book in the series, it's going to contain a fair bit of backstory. However the narration plods along. You never get the feeling that something revealing about the main characters is going to happen. The one big piece of action that took place when drizzt was born (the wiping out of the devir house) was somewhat sketchy too.  2) I couldn't care less about drizzt and indeed all the characters I've seen so far. There simply isn't much depth to drizzt at this point. Granted he might fill out later since there are like 9 books in this series but I doubt I'll ever reach that point. As an aside, Alton devir is simply unconvincing. Being the buffoon that he is, we're supposed to believe that he could impersonate the master of a sorcery academy for 19 years?! It just doesn't gel for me. And why did masoj, his reluctant student, suddenly decide to expose Alton to his matron after 19 years? No reason given - it just happened. Duh...  3) dialogues doesn't seem to be salvatore's strong suit. There are more melodramatic dialogues than I care to read and hardly any use of subtext (for examples, just read chapter 9, I.e.  Masoj's conversation with his matron in pages 115 and 116). Am I the only one who think that masoj talks like a kid and matron siNafay, a reasonable, thoughtful mother (yes your typical mother)? Weren't we led to believe that the all-powerful matrons are supposed to be,(gasp) bitches??  I realize i'm being extremely critical but alas this first book in the legend of drzzt series compares extremely unfavorably with other fantasy offerings I've had the pleasure to read. I feel compelled to share my thoughts even though my reading experience seems to run counter that of the majority of readers here.  Peace...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app is great. had sideloaded the youtube app but this one beats it by far. works good. mp3 download is a plus.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of these types of genres, but I gotta admit that I was surprised and moved by this movie! Even though the plot was about house slaves in the 60's, it actually brings up interesting subjects about snobby upper-class women that some people are for some reason afraid to acknowledge like how some of them shouldn't be having kids and such. Anyway, the story and characters were intriguing enough to make male viewers interested like myself. (I saw this without any females present!) I have to say that as much as I liked her in 'Easy A', this is Emma Stone's best role!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app-love all the translations and the download feature for certain translations.  my favorite feature is reading other people's notes on verses;   the reading plan reminders are also nice.  Would like a few more offline functions, but I cant complain- it's free. sorry for the typos- the kindle really isn't the best for typing....
B005LAIGMS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It was like watching some of Soderbergh's early work. I couldn't help but feel like I was watching an 'Out Of Sight' sequel or spin-off. The plot was not too complicated and the HUGE supporting cast were on par as I expected. Gina Carano did an awesome job especially in the action scenes! You can almost feel every blow in some of the fight scenes. It was almost as fun as watching Bruce Lee! I can't wait to see her in her next film! I'm a fan of her MMA career. Now I'm a fan of her movies or movie.

B004LUS390|5.0|I love this app! it is similar to the traditional desktop paint. But portable!

B004SUWR2C|5.0|This version of Uno has you set up in a kind of progressive game. You start out with just you against 1 computer opponent with all the basic rules. As you win against the computer and get further and further into the game, they throw in a few variations. You play with the same rules, but they throw in a few variations where if a particular card is played, everyone has to change hands. Eventually, when you are in the top levels, you are playing against 3 other computer opponents and there are all kinds of \\"wild\\" type cards that mix things up. Really well done, the colors and graphics are very nice and the progressive way in which the game is played keeps players from getting board as they get better at playing against the computer. One of my favorite apps for the Kindle Fire!
B006C1DH92|4.0|if you liked the traditional game, you will love this version. It runs fairly smoothly on the kindle fire, with very few glitches. I love the different challenges and levels and the fact you aren't just mindlessly slashing fruit. ( which is still pretty fun)

B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was a bit skeptical purchasing this DVD set because several of the reviews at the time mentioned poor quality on the DVD sound.  Also mentioned was many of the DVD's skipped and were distorted.  I decided to take the risk because I really wanted the set.  I am very happy that I did.  The set contains 42 DVD's and I have watched most of them and so far they have all been perfect in every way. I give this set a 5 star rating and highly reccomend it to anyone who was ever a Dr. Quinn fan.  My only regret is that the show only ran for six seasons.  I wish it could have continued for many many more.

I didn't shed a single tear through the entire tragic book, except for when I read the dedication.  I'm glad he wrote it for Esther, it gave an already powerful book an even deeper connection to real life.  I didn't cry for the simple reason that I was in awe.  I kept having to remind myself to blink while reading it.  When I finished I just sat, staring at the book in my hands, wondering at the inevitability of life and the astounding talent of John Green.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|I don't normally like a really large knife for the outdoors or for a camp knife, but this one has changed my mind.  First, this is a very tough blade.  It's full-tang and the blade thickness across the spine from almost the tip and all the way down the tang is about a quarter of an inch.  Yes, it makes it a heavy knife but the thing balances so well--right at the first finger groove--that the weight doesn't bother you when the knife is in your hand.  I wouldn't hesitate to baton firewood or pry with this knife if necessary, and it will also chop very well.  The design of the grip will facilitate a grip all the way to the front for fine work, in the middle for regular chores, and all the way to the rear for chopping.  The Kraton panels also give you great surface for gripping.  The steel is 1095 carbon steel and it will take a razor edge and hold it, mine will shave hair.  The sheath isn't bad, although I'd like a better belt attachment.  However, the MOLLE strap style attachment on the back will allow for a number of attachment options and the pouch on the front is roomy enough to contain survival essentials.  The Schrade SCHF9 is the best value on the market and should sell for twice the price, but for what it cost I bought a second after trying the first one!

B006FTCH2E|4.0|I don't watch a lot of movies and when I do tend to rely on recommendations from my kids that know pretty much what I'll enjoy. Another Earth was such a pleasure to have seen that I actually feel like thanking my kids for having had the experience.<br /><br />The synopsis and tons of reviews tell what the story is about so I won't say much about that except from my perspective.<br /><br />The main character, a college age young woman, has in her carelessness affected the lives of a small family. She causes a tragic accident and the subsequent grief has hollowed out both her life and the life of the husband in the small family. She so wants to be forgiven but can't begin to forgive herself; she sort of haunts the periphery of the man's life until she unexpectedly becomes drawn in. That's the gist, which in and of itself is so well done that you really feel inside the head and heart of the young woman.<br /><br />The filming of this movie is for me, what really makes it work. It seems as if it was shot with one small hand camera which makes it feel like I am almost a ghost, traveling along with the young woman as she struggles along. It bonds you in a way to her character.<br /><br />What is notable is that part of the story is that another planet Earth has been found and of course within the movie there is intrigue and a push to explore this new Earth as part of the background; while watching though I hardly remembered that they are actually talking about sending the young woman to the new earth. You'd think the sci-fi end of things would be a bigger blip on the radar but it's actually smaller things like a gesture in a friend's hand that she makes, it's those smaller things that grab the heart and draw me in. Hard to explain that part, but hopefully you get the idea.<br /><br />BTW; this is only my second movie review. I'm not really sure what folks are looking for in a good review since liking a movie or not is a very personal thing. If you'd like to leave a comment as to what things you look for most in a movie review, I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks!eview, I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks!

But it is Adele, and I adore her, so I wanted to really give it a shot. and boy! Was I pleasantly suprised!!! The sound quality is amazing! She is spectacular, as always! The Shouts and screams of the crowd really are left to a minimum being only at the beginning and end of the song, unless she talks to them, or they sing for her. Really, Really great album!

I love that the crocs have the strap in the back incase you need to really do some running, or flip it forward to make it feel more casual.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham's passion for justice is sometimes well-served by his literary skills, but at other times it seems to get the better of them.  Thus, of his death penalty novels, [[ASIN:B003B02O0A A Time to Kill: A Novel]] was good, [[ASIN:B003B02OS2 The Chamber]] was excellent and [[ASIN:B0042XA37Q The Confession: A Novel]]was downright execrable.  His novels about civil litigation are similarly hit and miss, from the entertaining [[ASIN:B003B02O3C The Rainmaker]] to the risible [[ASIN:B003B02OO6 The Runaway Jury]].  This book fits squarely into the latter category.  The premise is interesting enough: a young lawyer on skid row goes to work for a pair of squabbling old-timers.  And then an opportunity comes their way in the form of a chance to join a class-action lawsuit against a large pharmaceutical firm.  And here Grisham milks it for all it is worth.  For criminal law, I'll go back to old standards like Turow's [[ASIN:B0035IICUO Innocent (Kindle County)]] or Kessler's A [[ASIN:B005CQ991S A Fool for a Client]].  But for thrillers about wicked corporations and idealistic versus cynical lawyers, you can't beat Grisham.

So for Christmas, in keeping up with Spartacus tradition, I got him the second season on Blu Ray. We started watching it, and love the quality of the picture! But, the very last episode, the big battle scene, the sound went all funny, and there was a VERY noticable delay.

B005DBFZQU|5.0|... to make me rave about a performance of solo piano works by Robert Schumann, a composer I've never relished on an instrument that often hurts my ears? It would take a revelatory performance, a performance of such incision and yet such delicacy that I would finally \\"hear\\" the emotions of the music, from childlike delight to all the burden of a thwarted life, rather than the romantic clamor and clangor with which many pianists overload it. And what small differences of touch and tempo it takes to distinguish the performances of any two hyper-capable pianists playing the same music! I've pondered that question before, in my reviews of performances of the piano works of Leos Janacek by Schiff and by Håkon Austbø. Both pianists are energetic and precise, but Schiff is somehow more lyrical, more able to imply a melodic vocalism in the plunking of the keys. His \\"Janacek\\" was, to my ears, his finest recorded performance ,,, until I heard his \\"Schumann\\".<br /><br />But that raises another question. What would it take to induce Andras Schiff to perform/record more 'recent' compositions? Late 19th or 20th Century composers? I'm not derogating his whole cycle of Beethoven sonatas; Schiff's performances are among the very best. It's exciting to hear that he has chosen now to perform Mozart on a \\"period\\" fortepiano. But his B&ouml;sendorfer, which he takes the huge trouble to transport for concerts, is a purely 20th C instrument. It's obvious that Schiff loves Bach. I love Bach, you love Bach, we all love Bach. But his instrument loves Prokofiev and Schnittke. What would it take, for instance, to make Elliot Carter's piano sonatas intelligible on the second or third hearing? Per Nørgård? Fartein Valen? Even laborious old Paul Hindemith? Come on, Andras! You could do it!<br /><br />The two CDs of this package represent a kind of musical biography of Robert Schumann, ranging through his opus numbers from Opus 2 -- aptly named \\"butterflies\\" -- to opera 11, 15, 17 & 82, and then the six movements of his \\"Ghostly Variations\\" - Geistervariationen. Ghostly, as in 'Holy Ghost', suitable music for the unholy madman that Robert Schumann was.his \\"Ghostly Variations\\" - Geistervariationen.

B005LAIGH8|4.0|If you go to the cinema looking for pulse-pounding action and over-the-top antics, \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" can be crossed off your \\"to watch\\" list.  However, if you are entranced by emotions, adventure, and character development, this film will likely suck you in and not let go until the credits roll.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" begins by showing the extraordinary loving relationship between Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father Thomas (Tom Hanks).  When Thomas is killed during the 9/11 attacks in New York City, little Oskar is devastated.  In trying to re-connect with the presence of his father, Oskar finds a strange key in his father's closet and sets out on a quest to find out its meaning.  Along the way, Oskar meets up with an older gentleman (played by Max von Sydow) who helps him along.<br /><br />The remarkable aspect of this film is how it sets up such an emotional bond between father and son in a matter of minutes.  When Thomas is killed, you will feel a crushing sense of loss and as such root even harder for young Oskar to see through his epic quest.  Even when the primary narrative may wane from time to time, the young boy's incredible love for his father will be what keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />The characters are also very well-acted in this movie.  Horn carries the film in practically every scene, while Hanks is well, Hanks for the short time he is on screen.  Sydow picks up a key role roughly half way through the movie, while Sandra Bullock (\\"Mom\\" Schell) plays the grieving widower with great passion.<br /><br />This is a very down-to-earth film, as well.  Nothing is over-the-top or overly dramatic.  Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that the ending of the film may not initially gratify you, but once pondered upon will reveal itself as the right kind of conclusion for such a real-world effort.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close\\" is likely to, at the very least, find you rooting on young Oskar Schell as step by step he gets closer to re-discovering his father.  The experience will make you both think and feel long after the lights come up.r Schell as step by step he gets closer to re-discovering his father.

0618918248|5.0|I have read the Kindle version of this from the library. Some pages are repeated which makes it either annoying or a chance to go over what you forgot. However, I loved this book. It is current. Lots of material in here. Dawkins has done his homework. I don't know why people would not want to read this book. Even if they are religious it will show them what they need to work on to deal with people in the real world. Dawkins writing style is very easy to follow. I especially like his quotes at the beginning of each chapter. I have had the same concerns that he has had with the Bible. I love reading the Old Testament - but not for the same reasons as the Christians or Jews. I bought the Dawkins DVD (The Genius of Charles Darwin) on anthropology from Amazon a few years ago so I thought this would be an interesting read. I was not disappointed. Even though I have read it I still would like to own the hard copy. It is one of those books that you will always go back too. This should be a recommended reading for Philsophy, Anthropology, Socialogy and Religious Studies students. There is no doubt that many of the worlds violence has come from various religions each proclaiming to be the One religion. Even our own American Indians forced to stop their potlatch by the Catholics priests. To me the Catholics and Christians have slaughtered more people in the name of God than many non-religious groups. Sad thing is ....it is still happening. I never could understand why Christians bomb abortion clinics in the name of God. Dawkins delves into this equisitely. Read this book with an open-mind. It can only improve your view of the world.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife with Fixed 1095 High Carbon Steel Blade and Black Kraton Handle and Sheath are one of the best knives I have ever purchased and I love this knife.  Being the knife lover that I am and owner of numerous survival knives I was a bit skeptical when ordering this knife knowing it is made in China now. However, after receiving it and putting it through my testing phase for new knives I have to admit that the knife will fit well in any woodsman's survival tool bag or bug-out bag and be an awesome and useful addition.  The Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife is a very well made high quality knife which not only looks awesome but is very much a heavy duty workhorse of a survival tool. This knife is not only awesome looking but very comfortable in the hand with its black kraton handle and its hefty weight. It has a real good feel. It is also delivered super sharp right out of the box.  It has become one of my favorite knives along with another Schrade Survival knife equally as well built and in hand comfortable.  The nylon sheath that comes with this knife is also a very well made and well designed product with matching quality and not only holds the knife securely within a nylon covered protective plastic insert but also enables you to carry a magnesium fire starter, small folding knife or any other small survival item you might consider a necessity in a small sturdy detachable nylon pouch. The sheath comes with a leg tie and is a good quality addition to the knife.  To summarize In my own opinion I personally absolutely highly recommend this knife as a useful survival tool to carry on your outdoor adventures or in your bug-out kit.

0375842209|3.0|I'm definitely sure I'm going against the grain on this. Yes, the book was decent, and Zusak IS a good writer, but I didn't feel like the story matched the writing. (If that makes sense) I enjoyed his \\"I am the messenger\\" much more because I cared about the characters in that book. For me, The lack of a plotline for the majority of the book bored me, and it wasn't until 450 pages in that I felt compelled to really finish the book.

B002VHI8FE|2.0|I did buy and read all three books in this trilogy, so I can't really blame anyone but myself. Here's the deal - the author writes pretty well (after about screen 25 or so when someone helped out a little on style), and is really good at describing hand-to-hand fighting. He also has a fantasy that doesn't follow the worn out 'quest for the enchanted whatever by the wee band of heroes' story line. The first volume actually goes somewhere else - but where? Having spent the time to read all three books, I can tell you - without spoiling anything - that the endings will are, very disappointing. The incoherent story line (which is still being introduced half way into the third book (!)is laboriously and unsatisfactorily kind of/sort of ended. If there was any point to the many hundreds of 'Kindle pages' that it will take to get to the conclusions, you'll wonder what it was. (I'll not mention the times when the author got confused about which characters were present and which not - and switches point of view between a central character and one dead many pages back...)(Rats I mentioned it anyway, didn't I?) (If you look for them, watch for Glotka to be identified as Sult - twice...)<br />  On the bright side, at least it's a story that you'll not have read before, and there is one memorable character - Glotka. He is actually a lot of fun, and is present in much of the book, although he plays no more part than anyone else in the story line. And this brings up another major question. The author created a huge number of major characters, and gives us backstory and personality, and keeps them up and running through all three books. Very few have much to do with the story - they neither advance it nor explain it, they just occupy hundreds of pages. And while few of the characters do much in the book (beyond complaining) they do have tediously earnest developmental arcs. You, as reader, will get to see the character 'grow', but then the new, stronger, wiser character - will just flounder around and not use his growth to change himself - or the plot.<br />  So - conclusion. Fair writing style, unusual story, one interesting character, hundreds of pages of undisciplined dross, pointless ending.under around and not use his growth to change himself - or the plot.

B006WPSQVC|2.0|I gave it two stars for the message of father's taking responsibility otherwise it would receive none.  I completely believe in that message and applaud them for attempting to address the issue.  Unfortunately, they ruined the movie with the preaching and religiosity.  Men should (and many do) take responsibility to be a part of their children's lives in in every way.  They need to be more than just a pay check (if they are even that).  But they should do it not because God tells them to or they fear the consequences of not doing it.  They should do it because it is the kind of men they want to be.  They could have had one of the men be an atheist, one a Buddhist, one a Christian, etc...You do not have to have a belief in a god to be a good man.  And even if you do believe in God, it should not be preached at you so.  I am glad that someone had the \\"courage\\" to make a movie about this issue, but next time I hope a movie about this topic would be for everyone not just those who are Christian and don't mind being preached at.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I bought this after reading and enjoying Connelly's other recent short story collection, \\"Angle of Investigation.\\"  Clearly Connelly fans are divided on these collections, but I like them.  This volume is not quite as good as \\"Angle.\\"  The title story is the best.  In fact, it is excellent.  Pure Connelly in streamlined form.  The middle story, \\"Cielo Azule,\\" however is mediocre.  The story itself is fine, but the writing is choppy and a bit hard to follow.  The final story returned to good Connelly form...in my opinion.  Michael Connelly is my favorite current fiction writer.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his novels that I have read.  These short stories are a great way to get a Connelly fix without having to invest the time required for a full novel.  Kind of like a delicious afternoon snack as opposed to a full dinner.  I like both!!!

B0002ZDVEU|3.0|After having reasonably enjoyed The Bourne Identity, I was looking forward to seeing how the Bourne Supremacy carries on with Jason Bourne's story.  Bourne and Marie are in hiding in India, still trying to recover lost memories of the past.  But Bourne soon becomes another CIA target, after being framed for a killing, and for his own self-preservation he needs to take an active role in uncovering the secrets of Treadstone and of his hunters in order to discover why he's being gunned down.  There's action sequences and car chases a plenty, and the graphic violence did force me to look away more than once, but then again I'm known for being squeamish.<br /><br />Overall I didn't find that this film lived up to its predecessor.  The plot wasn't as plausible, and at times the motives and actions of the various characters were somewhat confusing.  The hand-held camera work has been lauded as enhancing realism by evoking an improvisational and authentic feel, but I found the frantic and jerky movement and blurry vision excessive and hard to follow, to the point that it detracted from the flow of the narrative.  Here's a case where movie-makers have adopted a home video style and just gone a little too far overboard with the deliberate amateur feel.  But perhaps most significantly, Jason Bourne's character wasn't as sympathetic as it was in the Bourne Identity.  Even though there's a real sense of him being a victim of his circumstances and even his use of violence is mostly out of necessity rather than by personal choice, there's also a sense that he's more of a colder and more vengeful killing machine after tragically losing his lady, so it's harder to empathize with him.  It's still refreshing to see a film that doesn't go overboard with foul language and blasphemy (there were a few incidences of this, but it was minimal and even less than the first in the series), but as a follow-up this doesn't quite match the strength of the original.  - GODLY GADFLY
B006CDCWDM|4.0|I've read a number of tennis books, and if the Sampras book focused on the mind, and Agassi focused on the heart, then Rafa is focused on the soul.  The book isn't particularly well written, but I imagine that it wasn't initially written in English so can't comment on how it would have flowed originally, although it does match the rawness that's part of Rafa's personality. Other reviews are correct that it was repetitive at times, but I wonder if that wasn't on purpose to show how important those points are.  All in all I thought it was an excellent read with interesting insights into what makes Rafa the man he is, and what it takes to play tennis at the highest level.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Jason Bourne is still running, and so is the Bourne series with this third entry, which carries on some of the plot and characters from the previous two episodes.  Bourne is still trying to discover his past, but now he must also decide about his future, and the kind of person he wants to be.  But some of the people behind the original Treadstone don't want Bourne to uncover the dark secrets that lie behind his entry into the world of espionage, and will stop at nothing to terminate his involvement.  Despite their efforts, Bourne presses on to unravel the complicated puzzle that is key to who he is, and does so not only with resolve, but also with a moral conscience.<br /><br />This is James Bond style espionage, but with less womanizing and more realism, both on the level of characters and action sequences.  Rated PG-13 for a handful of profanities/blasphemy but primarily because of the violence, which is intense at times but rarely feels gratuitous, the cinematographic style adopted by the director usually makes us share in the post-combat exhaustion rather than exhilaration (although as with the Bourne Supremacy, there are times where the shakiness is excessive).  The story is gripping, arguably even more so than the previous film, and for the most part matches the appeal of the first of the series.  Bourne's techniques favour quick thinking rather than excess weaponry, and his ways of overcoming the bad guys even are touched with warm humor on occasion.  He's no cold-blooded killer, but a man with a growing conscience that we can empathize with more and more, motivated more by remorse and restraint than revenge.<br /><br />In the final analysis, The Bourne Ultimatum is a ripping good suspense adventure that will keep your heart pumping from start to finish! - GODLY GADFLY
B0062NAX1U|5.0|What a FANTASTIC movie!!!  It has everything you could want, drama, humor, action, great storyline, good acting, esp Robert Amaya, and the message is just perfect. Fatherhood, YES, it's important, YES, any idiot can be a sperm donor, but it takes A REAL MAN TO BE A FATHER AND DAD....PERIOD. Men in the world need to step up and be the father the Lord wants them to be, that He expects them to be.  Just like the other Sherwood Baptist films, Flywheel, Facing the Giants and Fireproof, this lays it out beautifully, unheavy handedly, with a desire for people to realize we ALL have a Father who loves us, even if our earthly fathers do not. Some people have reviewed this basically saying they shouldn't have just made it just Christain men. Men of other religions should've been represented...this AIN'T that kind of film; not an anything-goes-and-is-acceptable movie....it's about the One True God, not about being PC, the truth is the truth whether you believe it or like it. It's about coming to the only King that can save and THAT is it.  If you've loved the other Sherwood movies, you'll love this...they just keep getting better and better!  God is blessing them all and their mission. If you've not seen them taken a chance, even if your on the fence as a believer, or just looking for something...hope, encouragement, love...I highly recommend you watch ALL of their movies...get past the 'unhollywood-esque' production and acting of the first one or two...and see it for the meaning, look past that superficial part...and you'll find wonderfully uplifting films about Gods love, with a powerful message about family, marriage, belief and hope.  ;) God'll getcha!
B00023B1LC|4.0|Jason Bourne doesn't remember who he is, or why people are trying to kill him.  So begins an extended chase film and action movie.  Considering that Jason has amnesia and doesn't even remember his own name, you can hardly blame him for the mayhem that follows - he's just acting out of self-preservation.  With the help of Marie, he slowly begins to uncover details about his past, including the fact that that he was a highly trained CIA assassin involved in high level operations.  But now the CIA is trying to eliminate him - why?  While on the run from his own government, Bourne slowly makes a transition from confused amnesiac to an efficient combat machine, and at the end shows real touches of being sympathetic and human, even if this isn't entirely credible given his professional resume.  In fact throughout the story he comes across as genuinely concerned for the people close to him, and even while keeping the trained operatives at bay he's presented as a sympathetic character who isn't motivated by revenge or blood-lust, and any violence he causes only happens because there seems to be no alternative.<br /><br />As far as action films go, there's something refreshing about the way that The Bourne Identity has made the transition from Robert Ludlum's popular book to the big screen, despite significant changes to the original.  The plot features a spy thriller narrative reminiscent from the days of the Cold War (although with a post-Cold War setting here), and raises compelling questions immediately from the outset, as viewers share Jason's desperate questions to discover who he is, why he has bullet wounds in his back and details of a numbered Swiss bank account in his hip.  The chase scenes and suspense rarely disappoint, and even though the body count in the film is reasonably high, gore isn't the central interest, and even the fight sequences are for the most part about efficiency rather than eye candy - there's no unnecessary bullets or explosions, and the end result makes the action more believable.  The extended car chase early in the film is one of the best you'll see in the business. Parents should be forewarned about several instances of profanity and blasphemy, but fortunately these don't dominate the film, and even the chemistry between Bourne and his counterpart is muted and relatively tasteful.<br /><br />It's not suitable for children, but mature adults will find some decent entertainment here.  Much of it might be considered cliche and generic, but The Bourne Identity does a good job of it.  Fans of action thrillers will enjoy something that is fast and furious without becoming larger than life or over the top, and with a sympathetic fugitive that is just as much a man as a machine, and who has a real conscience.  This might not redeem the film from all its flaws, but it does go some ways to making it stand out from the average. - GODLY GADFLYesult makes the action more believable.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|Salt is a very gritty and violent action thriller from 2010, and while it has a sparing amount of crude language, be prepared for a heavy dose of death.  We've seen the likes of this before, and usually there's some redemptive qualities that help make the level of violence more palatable.  In this case the female protagonist Evelyn Salt proves to be a cold blooded emotionless killer, and we see quite a trail of bodies in her wake.  The plot is quite suspenseful, because we're never entirely sure what side she and her surrounding cast are on.  The notion of sleeper agents is particularly interesting, but there are a few big holes in the story (e.g. why does Olsov go to CIA headquarters to blow Salt's cover?  Why doesn't she seem to know what he is talking about, but then cooperate fully with his plan?).  By the end you're left thinking that it was an okay ride, but not one you'd ever want to take a second time, or maybe even a first time. - GODLY GADFLY

B002SAS26E|5.0|Jaipur is easily one of the very best two player games I learned in the past year. Not only was it in the 2010 Spiel des Jahres Recommended list, but it picked up several awards, including the 2010 International Gamers Award in the Two-Player category, and it's proved to be a very popular little game among gamers ever since.<br /><br />The box contains a deck of cards and scoring tokens. The game has players function as traders in the city of Jaipur, capital of Rajasthan in India. You're going to be buying and exchanging cards from the market, trying to collect sets of goods such as leather, spice, cloth, silver, gold, diamonds, which you'll then trade in for points. There are also camel cards, which allow you to trade multiple cards at once, and this mechanic is part of the genius of the game.<br /><br />Altogether it just comes together in a way that is tense and rhythmic, to make up a package that rivals some of the best lighter two-player card games out there. While luck-of-the-draw certainly plays a significant role, there's enough room for decisions and it plays quickly enough to make it addictive. The nice components also enhance its case as a superlative choice for casual gaming with a spouse or friend. - EndersGame @ BGG

B000EOTAM6|3.0|Based on what was orginally an animated series of violent and sexually explicit cartoons, it's well been said that the heroine Aeon Flux is pretty much a female James Bond in an futuristic cyberpunk era.  Aeon lives in an apocalyptic setting, where the world has been decimated by a fatal virus and the 5 million survivors have been living for 400 years in an enclave called Bresna under the leadership of the Goodchild family that saved it.  But conflict emerges when members of the populace start strangely disappearing, and an underground resistance force known as Monicans emerges, in an attempt to assassinate the current leader of the Goodchild clan.  Aeon Flux gets the assignment to take out Goodchild, but in the process makes some startling discoveries that cause her to rethink which side she's on.<br /><br />The primary focus of the film is an action drama, with Aeon Flux and her fellow characters getting lots of camera time doing all kinds of cartwheels and handsprings in the modern setting that is their playground.  It's been said of the animated protagonist that she is \\"provocative, sexy, and acrobatic\\" - and that's exactly the way Aeon comes to life on the screen as well.  The film was pleasantly free of the crude humor or vulgar language that tends to be combined with this kind of character and action, but expect to see some sexual connotations (with a strong feminine character like Aeon, how can you not?), and lots of violence.  Although most of the victims are faceless, there were occasions where the blood and gore forced me to look away, and it's not surprising that the film got the PG-13 rating it did for this reason.  If the two main protagonists came across somewhat emotionless, they made up for it with the energy of their action and the destruction they cause, particularly Aeon's superhuman acrobatics.<br /><br />The action is backed by a relatively interesting, if not simple plot, which raises some interesting intellectual questions about contemporary ethical issues, cloning in particular.  In a world where the entire population has become infertile, Trevor Goodchild's quest is to find a way for normal pregnancies to happen, but his brother thinks that the status quo where the human race can only be perpetuated by cloning is a utopia that needs no change.  Perhaps nowhere is this better articulated than in the closing stages of the film, where the question is raised about whether a form of immortality achievable through cloning is superior than to a mortal life.  Aeon says: \\"We're meant to die. It's the only thing that makes things matter. ... To live once for real, and then give way to people who might do better. To live only once, but with hope.\\"  The implication seems to be that even if human cloning were ever to be successful, it wouldn't make human life more valuable than it is at present, even with its mortality.<br /><br />This kind of dialogue seems to raise deep questions on an important contemporary issue, and even hints at a moral stand against cloning.  But in reality the film only scratches the surface of it, and never really addresses these serious questions except for raising them in a somewhat vague manner at the very end.  Not that it matters - in the end Aeon Flux is really about cool looking fight scenes and a futuristic spectacle with intense action sequences.  And in the process, like much other science fiction, it shows the illusion of a utopian dream, namely that even if cloning does hold the promise of utopia, it would still result in a world where humans are inherently flawed.  Cloning won't redeem humanity, and Aeon Flux won't redeem the genre of science fiction, but it's a fun ride.  While it lacks substance, but it's still reasonable entertainment.  - GODLY GADFLYethical issues, cloning in particular.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, The Tourist is romantic thriller/comedy from 2010.  The central lead is Elise (Jolie), who is being pursued while on the hunt for her lover Alexander Pearce, a man who is on the run after reportedly stealing big dollars from a gangster.  Elise teams up with the unsuspecting Frank (Depp), forcing her pursuers to think he is Pearce in disguise, only to spark a thrilling chase through Venice involving both police and gangsters, both of whom are desperate to catch Pearce.  But will Elise and Frank survive, and will Pearce eventually show up?<br /><br />In comparison to most modern thrillers, this is a slow-paced film, and not surprisingly it's been criticized by many for being devoid of action, and for lacking chemistry.  But what many perceive to be a weakness, I'd consider to be a strength.  The slow pace and apparent lifelessness seems to be a deliberate throwback to the older Hitchcock style thrillers, adding to the intrigue.  And while Jolie's persona comes across as cold and calculating (an effect maximized by excessive and immaculate makeup), it's her fidelity to Pearce that holds her back from Frank.  The respite from the usual sexual smut Hollywood is known for is welcome, and the amount of offensive material we're used to from contemporary thrillers is refreshingly absent for the most part, aside from a few instances of crude language.  It's true that the storyline lacks high octane action and special effects, but the romp through Venice is a visually pleasing one, and despite their cool interaction, the two protagonists keep the story moving and our curiosity aroused.<br /><br />My only criticism would be concerning the surprising twist in the storyline at the very end of the film.  On the one hand it's a very well orchestrated surprise, but it does make the actions and motives of one of the characters earlier in the film rather implausible.  But at the end of the day, we shouldn't be taking this too seriously anyway, but just enjoy the ride.  If you're up for something slower and are happy to avoid some of the more offensive material that usually plagues Hollywood, why don't you hop on board this tourist boat and head to Venice? - GODLY GADFLYbut just enjoy the ride.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is a must have for any device. This is free and it still comes with tons of levels. Even if your not sure you'll like it, just download it and try it, you can always delete it.
0741470314|5.0|We all face great personal challenges in our lives that we overcome and move on from. For every one of us inevitably our environment changes, and so do the circumstances that bring people in and out of our lives. Only one thing is certain in this life and it is change. Michael Jackson said in his lyrics of Man In The Mirror \\"Make that change\\" and for Michael's followers these are words to live by. I know I am mindful of these words every day.<br /><br />There is one challenge in my life that I have come to know and accept that is different from anything that I have ever known in my earlier years on earth and I am honored beyond expression to be part of it, and it is spreading Michael Jackson's legacy, and educating people to the truth of who Michael really is. This mission is a part of every minute of my consciousness since June 25, 2009, the day that Michael Jackson left this earth physically. Life as I knew it ended that day. Upon learning that Michael passed away it felt as is the earth stopped rotating and there was a colossal global shift. Time stood still. When time started ticking again for me and I began to live under the magnitude of what had happened, nothing was the same. The man who lived the most dignified life on earth, in my lifetime was not a physical being among us anymore and as time passed I felt complete, gut wrenching despair.<br /><br />Like millions of people over the world I was stuck by the urgency to learn everything that I could about Michael, although I had known of him since my early childhood and I was fortunate to spend 40 years of my life on earth with him, I did not truly know him well. I became part of the world phenomenon of people becoming friends through love of Michael to support each other and to continue Michael's work. Michael was only one man yet I believe he did the work of millions. By joining many tribute sites and forums I read countless testimonials and stories of Michael's humanitarian work, work that is decades full of so many occurrences of giving they can't possibly be tabulated. Michael's giving is well documented and world record setting, and then there is so much that was done anonymously that we can't possibly know the full extent of his humanitarian reach and achievement. It is inherently understood by those the world over who love Michael that he lived the most dignified life.<br /><br />It's evident to any logical and reasonable person that Michael is the most beloved person of earth, but he is also the most lied about person in mainstream media. Self loathing people and yellow journalists are at the root of the lies created about Michael Jackson's life and the lies are perpetuated by some in a tarnished news publishing industry that was once respectable but it turned more tabloid by the minute whenever it covered Michael Jackson's life. To combat the lies and focus on all things positive, I decided I would ignore the nonsense and do all that I could in my daily life to educate people of Michael's truth. Michael said his messages are in his music, and who better can speak for Michael than Michael himself, so I simply started giving Michael's cds to random people, and doing things such as donating truthful books to libraries. Really any kind act, whether it's a small gesture of kindness or a few dollars given to a cause can be done in Michael's name. I want everyone to know that by my actions done in Michael's name kindness isn't strange, but hatred is.<br /><br />In the awe inspiring number of friendships that I have formed with people over the world united with me in living Michael's legacy, I learned of many people in countries and nations who live deprived of Michael's beautiful items that we have an abundance of here in the United States. I had to fix this so in September of 2009 I began what I call Operation Michael Jackson and the mission is to send Michael anywhere in the world where he is needed, just as Michael would go himself if he were here physically. Todaywe are a worldwide group of Michael's followers dedicated to giving Michael Jackson's items to those in need of all ages from infants to the elderly so that no one lives deprived. Sharing truthful books about Michael is part of our giving. One day I read about Karen Moriarty's book Defending A King ...and Karen and I became friends...and she learned of Operation Michael Jackson and I asked if I could have a book to make a traveling book for OMJ that could be sent across the world to be read by people who couldn't access it in their country. Karen graciously donated a book and the traveling book immediately began to travel. In the Spring of 2012 the book left me in the U.S. for The Netherlands, then it left there for Greece, and from Greece it's going back to two readers in The Netherlands, then it will travel to Chile next, and beyond. The book has many regions of the world to reach, and I trust it will go where it needs to go. It is truly an honor for me to recommend this book Defending A King on the highest level here in the Michael Jackson community of amazon, where intelligent people come to select truthful and entertaining books about Michael Jackson.<br /><br />To Michael, Karen, and all friends who are part of my new life today living Michael's legacy I quote Michael and with my deepest sincerity I attest, \\"I'm so proud to say I love you.\\"<br /><br />L.O.V.E. to all,<br /><br />Jacqueline<br />(DivinityInMotion)we are a worldwide group of Michael's followers dedicated to giving Michael Jackson's items to those in need of all ages from infants to the elderly so that no one lives deprived.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game helps me pass time on those slow days at work and helps me forget about the snotty day I've had. :D
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is, by far, the best Kindle Fire case I've seen. I've looked at several but was disappointed either at the material or the weight. This case is amazing! Very light, fits like a glove, and looks great (I have the pink one). NOTE: The pink case is pink on the back and has a black front. Still very stylish. And, I know this sounds a bit nuts, but I SWEAR the soft cloth inside cleans the display. I have very little smudges! Overall, I HIGHLY recommend! Oh, and did I mention I received the case THE NEXT DAY???? And I didn't pay for rush shipping! Just ground!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I usually don't like these kinds of games but angry birds is an exception . it is a great game and I get sucked in for hours.I can't wait for more new angry birds
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always loved playing spider on the computer so getting it for the kindle fire is great game to play while waiting around for laundry to get done and so many other times u have to wait for :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game for FREE! you can play for 20mins or 2 hours and continuously play a new game!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game and I play it a lot. some people may not like it though. it is a fun game and it is not a waste of time.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|my kindle is not able to download this app! there is an error in installing it. if you want some fun play 101 games or just plain old angry birds free. Or, if you have an ipod touch, download this app on that! it is a good app, if only it could work!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I downloaded this to have a Bible on my kindle fire. The app is easy to use and has loads of features. I am currently enjoying one of the reading plans. For hits, the app give the User a complete version of their choice at their fingertips. The downside is many of the features require a wi-fi connection. Overall I would recommend this app to anyone wanting a free Bible app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I love using it for my youth group. It's faster and easier to us and I recommend this app to those that read the Bible.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Love, love, love this collection.  I grew up with the 80's catalog of Mr.'s Clapton and Winwood and their fine solo careers.  With a little age and, hopefully, wisdom, I began to appreciate their work together in Blind Faith, as well as their music from other well-documented venues.  This live collection is the pinnacle of their collective musical genius.  I love the selection here - a nice mix from each resume, and I really enjoy the inclusion of the two Hendrix covers:  Little Wing and Voodoo Chile.  A favorite of mine here is Can't Find My Way Home, a searching, haunting song that has grown into one of my favorite classic rock tunes.  Steve Winwood's vocals are as great as ever, and of course, Eric Clapton will always be The Man.  Other favorites in this collection include Had To Cry Today, Forever Man and Split Decision.  This is great stuff and needs to be part of any classic rock collection.
0062515675|5.0|By far one of the best reminders out there that we are spiritual beings having a human experience! I have given a copy to the most important people in my life!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fantastic on my Thrive tablet!  Many unique features that l've never seen before.  Great graphics.  A must have if you like solitare.
B0069UP2PI|2.0|I'm a big fan of this genre of movies, but I was very disappointed by Contagion. The plot just plain sucks. I had high hopes, but somewhere, either in the writing or directing, someone failed to sufficiently develop the plot line. The viewer is left feeling like they missed a good hour of the movie (it's very short).
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This bag is great! I needed something to keep my new Nikon D3000 secure and safe while I traveled back and forth to studio. It's a lot bigger than I thought. Easily fitting 2 or three cameras and multiple lenses. The only minor complaint I have is that it does not have enough room in any of the pockets for a regular sized laptop. I really like this bag and for the price, you won't find a better product.
B004EPYZTE|2.0|I agree with some, the opening chase scene is pretty cool.  But, the rest was just bad. Bad acting, unlikeable characters...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it. there are so many games in one. so much fun. you will enjoy it for a long long time.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I do not usually buy movies from China as they seem to be of lesser quality than Hollywood, but I was pleasantly surprised with the Ip Man movies I purchased as stocking stuffers to myself. I am a Bruce Lee fan so this topic was of special interest to me.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Stunning 3D presentation, especially the credits bubble in the begining.  But, the false conclusions based on lies by Robert Redford is a major downer.

B0026P40NU|1.0|Filled with sexual messages, scenes and relationships. This is not a movie that would be a classic in my opinion. It was almost as if the movie was made simply to desperately try and sell by making sex its selling point.

B0019X3YXM|4.0|Had seen this movie before and love it. Wanted my own copy. A very light hearted romantic comedy. Kinda dumb but cute and entertaining. Elisha Cuthbert is cute and keeps you guessing what dumb thing is coming next. He loves her from the start and never gives up on her. Good movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an amazing movie with an amazing storyline!  Any person who has children could take some great lessons from this movie!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|whilte I was surprised that the mobile and tablet versions were $2.99, yet free from an online PC,,  I rely on this  progam SO often, and it is so amazing!! I wish I could afford Wolfram Math.  (drooool) wonderfull app, well worth the $3.00!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game was more than awesome.Fun it is a great game for kids. if u like random games its great for you
1596432594|5.0|This graphic novel biography of the life of Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman is an excellent introduction to this brilliant man.  Even for those, like myself, who have read some of Feynman's own books and already know many of the stories here, there is some new material, and even the familiar stuff is presented very well, bringing out the humor or pathos or beauty...from his work at Los Alamos and the death of his first wife Arline, to trying to get out of accepting the Nobel Prize, to testifying on behalf of a strip club owner, to his efforts to visit Tuva, it's all here.  Great stuff.
0525478817|5.0|Brutally honest and bittersweet, The Fault in Our Stars will tug at your heart-strings in the very best way. Hazel Lancaster is a cancer survivor but depends on an oxygen tank to keep her weak lungs functioning. Suddenly, they feel like they might collapse when the gorgeous Augustus Waters appears at one of her weekly support group meetings, in support of his blind friend, Isaac. As they slowly bond over their issues and love of books, the two play the dangerous game of falling in love where nothing can be certain, but persevere hand in hand until the very end. An absolutely moving novel that will surely bring you to tears.  Ever since Hazel got a second chance at life, never did she believe love would be in the picture. With all of her baggage, who would be interested? Gus soon makes himself known and quickly proves that she's completely worthy of his affections, making her feel special and like a normal teenage girl should. He charms her with his smile, gets her hooked on bloodbath zombie books, makes her feel loved and even grants her a special wish. Although I did feel things moved along quickly for them, I adored every stage of their relationship. It's emotional, real and feels entirely right. They're meant to be and it's backed up with visible evidence! Gus is one of the most unique YA guys for a variety of reasons - none that I'll be sharing with you! - and he'll win you over the second he appears in the book. I guarantee it!  If you're used to heroines who fight supernatural battles or rebel against corrupt governments, you'll love the refreshing voice of Hazel. How often do you read books like this? Where the girl is thrown into real life-threatening circumstances? Where she has a physical disadvantage? Where she sacrifices her own happiness so that the love of her life won't get hurt if she dies? Not only is Hazel mentally and emotionally strong, she manages to keep her sense of humour and enjoy what she can in life. Her relationship with her friends and family are explored too, realistically showing the affect cancer has on those around her. I truly adore how genuine this book is, not making Hazel's life perfect but really showing all of the flaws and complications.  If, like me, you've never read anything by John Green before, I'd say this is a great place to start. With his perfect balance of extreme wit, humour, romance and heartache, The Fault in Our Stars is a brilliant read. As you fall in love with all of the characters, you'll be hanging onto their every word and waiting to see what will happen next, following them every step of the way on this bumpy journey. Green's beautiful story about love and loss will wrangle your heart this way and that, making you ride his rollercoaster until the very last page. And what a ride it is...
1416955070|1.0|The writing style is fun and interesting, but the plot takes a relationship turn which ruined the story. Also, disturbed by the rewriting of history to assign a noble purpose to the Nephilim (refer to Genesis chapter 6 for their history).
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a really good fun app to play in the car or when you have nothing better to do! I enjoy playing it the most when my family is watching Tv.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|In order to really appreciate DRIVE, you have to throw the general formulas for scripts that you're used to out the window.  There isn't very much dialog in this movie, or at least for the first 20 minutes, but there are definitely lots of pregnant pauses. At first it seems a bit awkward that Ryan Gosling's character doesn't say much, but I learned to really appreciate the silence in the movie. It gave the movie a definite \\"cool\\" factor. It really helped to build the intrigue of the character and it added to the suspense. I found myself hanging on every word and body movement, which was really refreshing and it kept me on the edge of my seat. In a world of movies and TV shows with non-stop mindless chatter and jabbering, DRIVE was a breath of fresh air.  Without giving too much away, this movie is a cross between the action scenes of \\"Transporter\\", the mob/gangster storyline of \\"Departed\\", and the darkness of Donnie Darko (because the lead character was a bit strange in that movie, too). The music sounds a bit \\"80's-esque\\" as well, which was when the setting of Donnie Darko took place.  But with those slight comparisons aside, it's a unique movie with incredible style. The acting is superb, the music is awesome, and the script is well-written. Some people complain it's too slow. It's true that there aren't many \\"action scenes\\", but neither did the Godfather movies. Trust me, I have a short attention span like every other red blooded American, however, the movie never seemed to lag or get boring. There was always at least one plot line that kept up the suspense level.  I don't typically buy movies because I really don't like re-watching something I recently saw, but I loved this one enough to pre-order it so I can watch it again and again.
030788743X|5.0|Just finished this great book, cheated thou and used the audio version read by William \\"Wil\\" Wheaton who is best known for Star Trek: The Next Generation, or his recent parts on The Big Bang Theory. Not only was the book great, but I was amazed by the job Wheaton did reading it. If you like fantasy, science fiction, computer, online gaming and loved the eighties, this book could be the one for you. I grew up in the 70-80's and my first computer was a Texas Intruments TI 94/A with a tape drive, we're talking before Commodore 64.  This was 1981 hardware;  Memory: 16 Kb-48Kb RAM, 26Kb ROM. You would spend money on a code book, five days typing, and two more days debugging to get a cheap version of Donkey Kong. I am a mid 40s computer nerd who back in the day could roll many if not most Atari games, including Pacman which always took me 1 hour 43 minutes to roll.  The language and discription in the book took me back, way back to a time before internet and Amazon. Two thumbs up, way up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing. You will not be sorry that you installed it. I could not recommend it more highly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded to my kindle fire a few days ago. Love it!! One of the better solitaire games, works great ,easy to use.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|forget the others. this isflipping awesome and yes it is worth the download and money. cool beans. the best in the Angry bird saga. GET IT!
B0035OC7OU|5.0|This book is all about death and in this series he is given a humorous personality.  There are many witty parts that will get you laughing
B002RI9ZQ8|3.0|This was an entertaining read, a bit slow to start, it felt like the characters just stood around talking for the first third of the book. It got a bit interesting after that, but I'm afraid I thought it was pretty predictable. It was a bit like watching a typical Hollywood action / thriller movie. There were no real surprises for me. It has Hollywood written all over it, so no wonder they have turned it into a movie. If blockbusters are your thing, you will love it. But if you want something different, I wouldnt recommend it. I dont think it is worth all the hype it is getting, I consider it probably slightly above average (hence the 3 stars)but I am glad I read it so now I know.
B000W9399S|5.0|Loved this story, it defiantly got me hooked on the series.  Its confusing for the first 30 pages because you're just plopped down in the world and it takes a bit to figure everything.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Happy with this app!  Very addicting!  Its hours of entertainment and I can even play at work. Its very easy to.use and.even my kids enjoy playing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is superb and amazing and I love I can take it anywhere I go whenever I want to.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game kept me occupied for a while and honestly what more can you ask for in a free app game?
B004SBX112|5.0|I like it I all ready finished all the levels. I. like the dragon it makes the levels easyer so fun
B005VT42BS|5.0|Does what it says, and rather well. Get some pretty granular details on the network you're connected to including a list of hosts.
B00499IADM|4.0|book in condition as described  just took over a week longer than promised  but a great deal for the price
B0063IH60K|3.0|when i put a 3 under a 4 it doesn't let me..... weird but anyway i really like this card game
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this game sucked a lot don't get. not worth your money. oh wait its free! hahahahaha. cheese taste really good. wa wa.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Friends had been telling me to read this book, and I finally got around to it and COULD NOT put it down. I was late to work because I didn't want to stop reading the story. I read it on my lunch, breaks and finished it when I got home. Can't wait to start reading the second one. Even though it is found in the young adult category, it's a must read for any one, any age. Every page keeps you on edge, wondering what is going to happen next, with the finale making you want more. Buy, rent or borrow this book!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game was awesome. the screen is really greasy. don't like it. rated one star for fun. Hehe. maybe because I dumped hamburger meat on it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I started out by getting the sample of the book and as I started to read the story, I forgot it was a sample, so when the page popped up telling my sample was at an end, I immediately bought the whole book. I was enthralled with the story from beginning to end. As soon as I finished book one, I bought book two. Anxiously awaiting the third installment!!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|Although this case did not fit my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S 11, it was returned without a problem.  The supplier contacted me with an apology, I received a full refund within a short period of time, and very satisfied with the outcome. I would definitely buy products from this company again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wonderfully simple and fun. Pick it up if you enjoy puzzling games to pass the time or even just something to relax with.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Game trilogy is by far the best books i have ever read. It is deep and thought provoking as well as a fast page turner that does not bog you down with too many details. I developed a connection with the character, that left me almost sad in a way once the last book was done. If you have not read these books you are missing out!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's very entertaining and educational.  This is a great way to teach kids about the environment and the importance of taking care of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|most apps are very intertaining for me but this one really stands out u can play several games with only one app and its so addicting I have gone for hours until I got yelled at for playing with electronics all day!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun little time waster - reminds me of the arcade games of the 80s. Well worth the download! Plays perfectly on my samsung epic touch...
B005T87QCI|5.0|the game is awesome. I like the bits with the kick ass.  this game I love because its got lots of.rounds and that's super fun.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Was looking for an apparently solar yo teamviewr. This apparently is amazing and I would recommended to everyone and anyone.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this Bible app! It's really useful. The only down side is I need Internet for it to work. I heard that's because the Bible is so big :(  otherwise, I love it!!! (:
0060873027|4.0|When I saw this book I started salivating.. Crichton and Preston are my two favorite science authors and a tandem book sounded right up my alley. The book keeps you on the edge of your seat and offers the usual Crichton/Preston details that appease science nerds such as myself. I found it easy to read and very swift paced and enjoyable. That being said, the book was lacking some finishing touches and several times during the crescendo I felt unsatisfied with the way things tied up, or didn't among the characters. I liked it, but it felt a bit unfinished, and perhaps for a reason..
0891419195|5.0|If you only want to read one book about the infantryman's war in World War 2 then read this one.<br /><br />Sledge's book is well-written and very descriptive.  He conveys the terror, horror, and filth better than any other author I've read.  Sledge's war was not gallant, but it did have valor and self-sacrifice in abundance.<br /><br />If you have watched the mini-series \\"The Pacific,\\" you should read this book to get a more accurate impression of the quality of the US Marine of World war II.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|No surprises - we knew what was on this CD.  My wife loves it.  The rest of these words have been added so that my review will meet the twenty-word minimum requirement.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Ho hum. Simple games, but if that is what you are looking for, you will enjoy this game.  Not bad for free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun...easy to use...great value..it is a quick fix when you want to play..highly. recommend this game thank you amazon
B006M3JVD6|4.0|Overall, this was a great read but with highs and lows throughout the book. Jaycee writes in her introduction that her thoughts jump all over the place throughout the book and it can be quite confusing, which, at times, is certainly the case. At times it also gets very repetitive. Before reading this book, I didn't really understand Stockholm Syndrome and the affect it can have on victims, but I now feel like I have a better grasp on how the victim feels and the reasons they don't try to escape and such. What happens to Jaycee in this book is described in graphic detail and can be very uncomfortable at times, but it's such an interesting and real story that I found it impossible to stop reading - even through the most disturbing parts. Another great read for anyone interested in true crime stories.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|The Plantronics Voyager series headsets are the only bluetooth headsets that I found that fit comfortable. The Voyager Pro HD is the best one yet! I ordered the product late one evening and paid for overnight shipping. It was delivered the next day at 2:00pm. Amazon provides great shipping.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|This is one of the finest movies ever made! The 2 disc anniversary addition is so worth everything. It gave me hours of pleasure to see the \\"behind\\" the scenes and to listen to Ron Howard comment on how the movie was made is absolutely entertaining. I can't stop watching the movie ever!!!! The actors were so on the mark with their parts. Everything was just PERFECT.Oh, and I must say that Ed Harris was just perfect in his emotional role!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a great game I could play all day and those games I cant wait to unlock all of them

B0031OCY2E|3.0|To look at the package (brand-identity) for this film you could well be forgiven for thinking it has mixed echoes of various generations past, a fair m&eacute;lange of design styles and typefaces are all swimming around. Certainly it has a clear and definite design-style, chosen to create an impression of being a period piece, think: Catch me if You Can, Down with Love or the Pink Panther and in terms of design nomenclature you would be in the right ballpark. Funny then, that this film is set in NINETEEN NINETY-TWO! Clearly the costume designer, productions designer, make-up artist and set designer were absent from a few crucial meetings somewhere along the line because the whole balance of the film is way out of kilt and abound with horrible mixed-metaphors and blatant inaccuracies. Couple that to a low-budget cast, uninspiring performances all-round, drab dialogue and you get what you get, this.<br /><br />To me, this film has no real defining merit, there is nothing to demonstrate why the studio chose to adopt this screenplay over countless thousands of others they had access to. This film really has the feeling that the studio wanted to have a Soderbergh film on its books and he (being busy) was only able to fit this in between other projects; real projects which he was focused on and where he was in the zone.<br /><br />To summate: this film should be consigned to the B list of film where it belongs. If you see it advertised on television and you have time to kill, by all means watch it. However, in terms of a serious purchase or rental with your hard-earned, I wouldn't.

1849025940|5.0|I read this book as a teen, long before I met the love of my life who convinced me to finally take the leap and go to Paris.  The first year, before I could afford school which allowed me to apply a working visa, I wasn't much better off than Mr. Orwell's character working under the table, at menial jobs.  I worked watching spoiled kids and in overpriced restaurants with abysmal kitchens and descrete restaurants with excellent food and spotless kitchens, happily, just to be living the dream.  I met people who were just happy to be in the presence of a magical New York American.  After I got my working visa, I had night club and office jobs.  All the jobs I had the pleasure of being employed at began with the staff gathering for a meal and wine before the shift, and ended with our gathering at the cafe for wine and coffee.<br /><br />I had long ditched the Anglophone safety of the American and Irish bars, for the seduction of art, romance, conversation, music that is the magnetic force of Paris.  From the bookish scientists and engineers, to the people from all French colonized countries, who religiously slay live animals in courtyards to be eaten in foyers with those of the same faith, or just broke hungry folk like me, to the avante garde elderly musicians who perform musical theater on the perepherique, et the youth who perform live Reggae sur les bateaux; the friend who becomes your lover and vice-versa, enlightening you for the next interaction; everyone is a philosopher and all spend hours debating history as it relates to current politics/their personal philosophy, .  The lights, the language, the sights, the food, the love, the accordion music, the cathedral bells.....<br /><br />I have survived on one bottle of red, a stale baguette, and a bottle of water, shared with true friends.  I have dined on the finest fare in the company of true friends.  I have been loved with abandon and hated as well in Paris.  I would not change a single moment of my life there.For the years that I was there I was a happy Parisienne in Paris.  Isle St. Louis, Trocadero, Cours de Vincennes, Chatelet Les Halles and Centre Georges Pompidou, Montmatre, Rue St. Jacques:)<br /><br />I lived a unique year in London, but that's another story.<br /><br />Now as lady luck has stopped spoiling the west, I am re-familiarizing myself with the reality of doing with less with an attitude of gratitude.  It seemed easier to do when I was surrounded by 1200 year old works of art, and several hundred year old magnificent architecture to walk along the cobblestoned streets and contemplate my next move, but I cannot say that I have not lead a charmed life, before and after.  I have been blessed.<br /><br />I will absolutely always have Paris.  Much love to the young man who paved my way to Paris, all those years ago.<br /><br />Big shouts and love to my long-time friend and Paris benefactor:) Richard Shalhani, owner of my favorite restaurant SAVANNAH CAFE . 27,rue Descartes, Paris, France. 01 43 29 45 77  Hope to see you soon!

0061765236|4.0|This book is fantastic, and in my opinion one of Picoult's best. I was pulled into the story right away and I finished it in one sitting. I loved and sympathized with Emily's character. Her relationship with Chris kind of felt wrong to me right from the beginning, so I understood her mixed feelings about it. Chris' character really bothered me - he just seemed overly possessive and not really concerned with what was best for Emily (in spite of supposedly loving her so much). This is a book I will definitely read again. A must read for Picoult fans!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you need a reminder in life about how important it is to have a fatherly figure in your life this is a movie for you.  Even just a reminder on how important it is to spend time with your family, most importantly children because you never know what will happen from day to day.  This movie also reminds us how awesome our God is even if it's the best day or the worst day of your life!! Pass on this movie to those you love!!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|Mr. Locke's book does point out things that might be \\"obvious\\" i.e. having a website, using Facebook and Twitter. But he'll show you *how* to use those mediums properly. And he'll help you to focus on selling to your readers (they aren't all the same). He's very up front about the fact that he had ten books under his belt first and that the mileage of those who don't will vary. Money well spent!

B000SW2F6M|4.0|Orlando Bloom is shown hotshoeing a horse. Iron horseshoes would not be in common use for another 200 years and hotshoeing was still 500 years in the future.<br /><br />Also Bloom is forging swords which are glowing red, and handles the \\"cool\\" end with his bare hands. Yeah, that end would still be 400 or 500 degrees.  But then he severely burns his hand on a tiny cross that has barely touched the flames.<br /><br />A character talks about dying from a blood clot caused by bone marrow, which was obviously unknown in 1000 AD and the worst cliche plot device from \\"House.\\"<br /><br />Also, it is not clear how Bloom goes from bullied little brother to Terminator-like killing machine, although there is mention of previous military experience.<br /><br />And it's not clear why he is able to return to his home where he had been wanted for murder.

But then it was listed as the faotd and I snatched it up with no hesitation whatsoever. I love the interface, the customization. and how organized my calendar is. A little slow in loading time, but not a terrible concern for me. I only wish there was a widget! For those, like myself who likes to color coordinate, have lots of options, AND be organized, this is certainly an app worth paying for!

The interface is simple &amp; it does exactly what I want it to do. I researched all the radio apps available before deciding on TuneIn, and for my usage, it's the best: straight-forward access to Internet Radio without so-called DJs cluttering up the works.  No problems running on my MyTouch 4G Slide. Just have to watch the bandwidth when away from a wi-fi connection.

B006OB3K56|4.0|WARNING:  While not explicit, per se...this review does touch on some subject matter some folks might simply not want to read about.  I don't mean to offend anyone, but there's no way to review the movie otherwise, in my opinion.<br /><br />SHAME has been called the \\"movie about the sex addict\\" and this is a rather unfair over-simplification.  It also implies that there might be lots of juicy sex scenes, especially given its NC-17 rating.  If THIS is what you're expecting, you are in for a disappointment.<br /><br />Director Steve McQueen's film is a character study of one very specific sex addict, Brandon (Michael Fassbender).  And I'm not even sure if Brandon is a sex addict or something different.  He is certainly a man driven to spending virtually all his spare time (and much of his time at work) viewing porn and pleasuring himself.  He spends lots of money on prostitutes.  He is also attractive enough to draw yearning from women looking for a good time and a quickie in an alley (literally at one point).  But NONE of these activities give him any pleasure whatsoever.  In fact, he seems to suffer a psychic pain at his despair in not truly drawing any pleasure from his compulsions.  I read one review in which the viewer describes him as a \\"monster.\\"  I felt much the opposite...he is a creature to be pitied.  Having said that, I felt pity mostly because we saw everything from Brandon's perspective.  Not much attention is paid to the damage he may be causing others (with one key exception, which I'll discuss below)...therefore, we see HIS torment and HIS unhappiness and HIS damage.  It's hard not to feel sorry for him, even as we're repulsed by his activities.  This is a smart guy who knows better...but his self-knowledge only makes him hate himself more...it does not curtail his destructive activities.<br /><br />Brandon's specific damage is linked to the damage his sister carries (Carey Mulligan).  She, too, is looking for love and is deeply unhappy.  When she moves, unasked, into Brandon's spartan NYC apartment, she is an interloper on his privacy, but more importantly, she reignites unhealthy feelings each shares for the other.  They are very open with each other about their bodies (there is a long scene where the two have a heated exchange which she stands naked in the shower, and makes no effort to cover).  They give each other longing looks.  They've clearly both been damaged by events in their childhoods, and this has created a strong but very unhealthy bond between the two.  Brandon senses it more than she, but his efforts to push her away are damaging to both of them.<br /><br />SHAME is a well-crafted film.  There are many interesting shots.  In one, Brandon is running down an avenue, and the camera tracks him for several blocks, in one long take.  In another scene, Brandon and a co-worker are on a first date at a restaurant, and one long shot captures the first several minutes of the date...from amusing encounters with the waiter to telling moments of conversation.  It's a fascinating and engaging scene that a viewer will either find riveting (because so many little moments are so telling) or dull as can be (because they talk about so little and the camera is so still).  And there's another scene in which Brandon's sister sings a VERY slow version of \\"New York, New York\\" in a nightclub, while Brandon listens.  The torment they each express is gripping, and with almost no words (beyond the lyrics of the song) we learn an awful lot about their relationship.<br /><br />Mulligan is outstanding in her role, and she should be in the Oscar conversation.  She exposes herself physically in unflattering ways, but is heartbreaking as well.  Fassbender is riveting as well.  His performance is daring in that he has totally committed to this pitiable, unlikeable role in such a way that after just over ninety minutes, we feel we know Brandon about as well as we have ever known a movie character.  We don't know the facts of his past, or quite what he does for a living.  But we know his pain.  We see how his mind works.  Yes, there's also full frontal...but that seems less brave than the anguish he puts himself through.<br /><br />The sex in the film is actually not a whole lot more explicit than what you'd see in an R-rated movie.  It's the casual nudity in other scenes that got the NC-17 rating.  But none of it is titillating or erotic.  This is a movie that shows sex is not only NOT a substitute for meaningful human contact but can actually destroy goodness, ambition, empathy and humanity.  Sobering stuff.<br /><br />SHAME is a well-made film, extremely well acted, that will absolutely turn off most viewers.  This is not to say that someone only \\"sophisticated\\" viewers or \\"daring\\" viewers will like it.  I admired it greatly, but didn't enjoy it.  It shows ugly, unpleasant things happening...even if you aren't bored by the slow pace, you might be greatly put-off by the subject matter or the view of humanity it posits.  I'd say \\"see it,\\" but if you hate it...don't blame me for wasting your time.  I've probably not seen a film that is more of a \\"viewer beware...you may both LOVE and HATE this film at the same time\\" since BLUE VELVET.ow his pain.  We see how his mind works.

B004H4XI5O|3.0|I felt like I pushed myself through this book hoping to the very end to feel that I could remember things a little better, but it never happened.  I definately don't feel any smarter for having read the book.  The only thing I can remember about the book after a couple weeks of finishing it was it's about a guy teaching himself to remember things for tournaments and I learned that the real Rainman died a couple years ago.  Other than that I don't think I'd recommend it to a friend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hey I'm just doing this for the coins.... but it is an ok game. I like all the selections they give you... great games... btw: for the air hockey one.... put the thing in the slot the hole time... thing=whatever the thing you hit the Puck with is called. (;
B00005N5S2|4.0|Ok, it is hard to live up to George C. Scott in \\"Patton\\", but this is a worthy effort by one of my favorite actors from the past, Gregory Peck. I feel that the storyline is closer to fact than some parts of \\"Patton\\" were, as they, including Francis Ford Coppola, were a bit inventive in that movie, to say the least. MacArthur brings out the complexity and hypocrisy in this flawed, but very talented commander, who ultimately was a much more important person in the US Army before, during and after WWII. He was arguably the most powerful US military leader ever. An enjoyable film.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the game I admit some of the games can be hard but you can still get points for playing and then you can buy other games.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I can't believe I actually read the entire book. This book is full of unrealistic drivel that had me rolling my eyes constantly.  Don't waste your $3.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate and feature-filled app. I love that I can see what the weather is like in all the places my family live. Very easy to set up, and there's virtually no lag when updating. I would give 4.5 stars if I could, due to the incorrect notifications. Either I misunderstood the description or I have misconfigured something, but instead of the current temperature I get an indication that I have waiting notifications in the kindle status bar at the top of the screen. I would recommend this app.

Guns, Germs and Steel is the forefather of all such books and is a must read for anyone from High School to the Grave.  I don't sometimes agree with the New Yorker Magazine but I must agree wholeheartedly with their comment.  \\"The scope and the explanatory power of this book are astounding.\\"
0761119752|5.0|My two-yr old son LOVES this book.  We got it as a gift before he was born and have been reading it often ever since. We used to read it just before bed but he started handing it to me at any time of day for me to read it to him.  He used to bounce to the sing-songy words and point at the pictures. Now he turns the pages and claps as I read.  VERY cute pictures, LOVE ANYTHING Boynton!  We got a whole set of her books and have loved every single one.  Her books are the only one my son hasn't gotten tired of!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really did enjoy this book. I think that the idea behind it is brilliant, a society that is so totalitarian that it can force its citizen's children to kill each other. However, I think that the idea should have fallen into the mind of a different author. The research here was pretty scant, and that was obvious. The author had little knowledge of the actual workings of science or medicine, or even what it is like to be injured. Moreover, the author clearly has no idea what it is like to kill people. The descriptions of combat and the decisions of the main character are ludicrous at best. Even though I enjoyed the suspense of the book, I couldn't help thinking \\"Oh my god, how stupid are you?\\" I understand that there are people who are unable to take a life. That's fine. I just think that the author didn't properly describe the thought processes involved. In a real world scenario, once the main character got the bow the whole competition would have been over. She could have stayed in her little hiding place overlooking the lake and killed off the top oppponents. Morevover, when those 'Careers' chased her up a tree, there was a moment when they had all fallen asleep under her. She should have slit their throats. If she couldn't bring herself to do that, fine. That makes sense. But, to drop a nest of wasps on them? How ridiculous. her plan nearly killed herself. There are many more scenes like this and the lack of logic bothers me.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|The product description is right on target.  Bought the Kindle for my boyfriend.  He is 68 and has a little arthritis.  He was really frustrated with the kindle at first, that because of the arthritis in his hands, he couldn't hold on to it right without touching the screen or slipping from his hand and then it would do all sorts of things and he would lose his place in the book.  He was about ready to give up on it.<br />So ordered this cover, thinking it would add a little bulk and give him something to hold on to, but it had to look really nice, too.  It Worked! He hasn't lost his place once.  Now he doesn't think about trying to hold the kindle \\"just right\\", he just gets to enjoy reading.<br />He is absolutely thrilled with the cover.  It is very classy, and when resting on his nightstand, just looks elegant.  As he did when he first got it, just roll the binding a bit, and it will loosen up and it will lay flat.<br />I just can't express how beautiful this cover is, and how it really does look like the binding of some old-world book you find on some collector's book shelf.<br />This cover is for someone who (like my older boyfriend) had grown up reading real hardbound books and appreciates the nostalgic look/feel of the past.
0071752854|5.0|Oren, I was first exposed to this concept in Simon Sinek's speech at TED in 2009 (practical uses for the three brain theory in business settings).

Yours was last (a week ago). It is also the first one I finished and probably the only book I have highlighted end to end; it is more highlighted than not.

B004JLDSIC|5.0|\\"Although I am an instrumentalist, I have always had a strong affinity for song. There is no more meaningful form of self-expression for me than to play a ballad with the poetry of the lyric reverberating through me and guiding me. I hope that my love of the lyric communicates itself sufficiently to justify the choice of album title.\\" ~ Jim Tomlinson ~<br /><br />\\"The Lyric\\" is one of the few but superb albums of Jim Tomlinson, a fine tenor saxophonist whose style of playing is absolutely ear-catching. He shares the spotlight with his wife and musical partner, Stacey Kent, who graciously adds classiness and freshness to the melodies with her ever-sweet and sun-kissed voice, flawless diction and beautiful-as-pink-roses-interpretations. In my book of jazz, they belong to the top list of fine singers and musicians of all-time.<br /><br />Mr. Tomlinson considers this album as \\"their baby since it is the first album produced under his own label, and the one that they are most proud of as it is the recording that comes closest to their live collaborations.\\" That is especially true -- this album is one of the finest ever recorded, with no frills and embellishments of a full orchestra and yet it is superbly done. It was originally released in 2006 and was reissued on March 22, 2011 by Blue Note.<br /><br />The choicest cuts that will leave the listeners breathless for their raving beauties are Lerner and Loewe's \\"I've Grown Accustomed To His Face,\\" Parish and Carmichael's \\"Stardust,\\" and to top it all - Alan and Marilyn Bergman's \\"What Are You Doing The Rest of Your Life?\\" done in the most dramatic fashion highlighting Tomlinson's sweepingly striking sax solo and Newton's beautifully sounding piano.

Most \\"karate\\" films were cheesy and unbelievable (flying in the air and whipping twenty guys at once as they take turns attacking of course) Enter the Dragon actually tries to have a storyline and attempted to legitimize these kinds of flims. It is very dated and when watched after all these years you see all the ugly holes in it from awful acting to foolish looking fighting BUT I recommend fast forwarding to watch Bruce do his thing and you will see why he was and still is the Best!
B000Y11BAS|5.0|This is a great combination in one dvd!  Both movies are good. I enjoyed it with my family. Totally recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is my favorite. works great on my kindle fire. very quick and easy to find books, chapters and verses. and my favorite feature....dozens of different versions of the Bible. the only drawback is you need wifi for it, but it's a very minor drawback. would recommend it to anyone.
B001FB55MG|5.0|shipped it very fast and was in great condition just as advertised. will buy more from them in the future.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is a beast.  its so conveinent and helpful and lets me see what the weather is going to be like in 15DAYS.  the best book I ever read was called (manhunt the 12day chase for Lincoln's killer).  its all about how Lincoln was assassinated and how jhon Wilkes booth fled to the south for protection.  great book. highly reccomend it like this app ;)
0385534639|5.0|Such a fun read. Vivid descriptions full of wonder & whimsy, loved it. I did find the time frames a little confusing at times, but really it didn't detract from the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun!!! I could sit And play this for hours ... I love the soccer game :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it!! Good for kids to play and when you have idle time on your hands. Can be a little addictive!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game. have played this game forever.  always a classic. works great. easy to play. can choose to play a winning game or a random game.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|works great on the fire, though I did have one force close in the beginning it hadn't happened since.  The add is tiny and does add a short lag when coming up, I don't really notice it much.  Fun and free, what more do ya want?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games, but doesn't tell you how to beat the games.  otherwise its pretty simple and a good way to waste your time
B0052GACNM|4.0|An outstanding CD collection. A great collection of contemporary artists, but it is Tony Bennett himself that shines through. The man is a silver tongued devil! Many classic hits - you do not get cheated in terms of content.

0307454541|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I purchased it from a book store on a whim, but was very happy I had. When I was done I went out and got the other two. I had to know what was next for these characters.
B004707ARU|5.0|I was looking forward to this reissue, not because the sound was remastered, but because of the extra goodies added.  I enjoyed it immensely and was not disappointed.  Definitely worth the price and long live vinyl!
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this APP!  It alows you to listen to the radio through your fire... perfectly.  Easy to use, no fuss no muss.  And even better it was free.  :-)
0141192429|5.0|The Penguin Classic edition is beautiful and the extra materials were a nice addition.  The novel itself is a compelling mystery, beautiful written and brilliantly plotted.  I couldn't put it down and I was sorry when it was over.  In addition to the sheer enjoyment of reading a well-written mystery, Wilkie Collins accomplishes what many of our contemporary male authors (Franzen, Eugenides ect.) have attempted and failed to do - create a compelling, realistic female character.  Marian Halcombe is wonderfully developed and an empressive Victorian heroine.  This is a novel for readers who enjoy a good mystery as well as readers of literary fiction.  It certainly deserves its status as a classic, but can be easily enjoyed by the modern reader.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|I admit I haven't read all the reviews for this movie (there are over 500 of them!) but there may be others who espouse my view, I don't know. I LOVE James Bond. I have all the movies in this series. Quantum of Solace gave me a major headache, though.  I love the entire James Bond series of movies and I tried, yet again today, to watch Quantum of Solace. It is so headache inducing as to be unwatchable. That bums me out since I want so much to like it. I'm glad that I prefer the older movies to this modern stuff. Is it really standard procedure to film action sequences in such a way as to have the camera angle change every 1/2 second? Is the modern stunt acting really so bad that there has to be be cuts that often? Seriously - if the director got what he wanted in one sequence it would be filmed as such and these action scenes would be amazing, but the dizzying, headache-inducing camera angle changes every 1/2 second during action sequences make it painfully obvious that they couldn't get it right most of the time and had to cut the film many times and splice it back together in order to get a 30-second scene. It literally gives me a headache watching it and I'm not one prone to that sort of thing.  Kudos to those of you who can watch this movie without getting a headache. This may very well be a great story and plot line but I'll never know because I simply can't stomach this for more than a few minutes. James Bond rocks, but this movie makes me literally nautious to watch for any prolonged period of time.  Give me the OLD James Bond films which I can watch without headaches or dizziness. If this is typical of all new JB films, my allegience ends with Die Another Day.  I apologize to die-hard Bond fans (of which I'm one) but I simply cannot watch this movie to the end. It just makes me too disoriented.  Even though I can't watch the movie I give this three stars because I love the Bond series and believe it's probably a good story. I don't wish to bring the rating down just because I have a problem watching it. I really wish I could watch it without getting dizzy at times. I don't blame the story itself but I am disappointed in the direction and camera work. For that, I take off a couple stars. Oh well, it's probably just me.  Peace.

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|For this film I must say, in my opinion, is a welcomed end to a long struggle for the Harry Potter story. The movie did a nice job of drawing you in and leaving you wondering how and when something was going to happen. However, the movie came together in a grand form answering all the questions you may have had throughout the entire Harry Potter story. The final battle with Harry and the dark lord was very mild in my opinion. I was hoping to see a little more action, strength, and power surrounding love, which was emphasized in previous movies, but the end was really only based on equipment ownership...a bit disappointing.
B001VI5MMG|5.0|Awesome, edge of your seat, commical, love story all wrapped up in one.  This movie has all the elements for a good movie.  A nice and refreshing movie that didn't have anything that you wouldn't mind your mama watching.  :~)
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I only bought LastPass because there is no RoboForm app for the Kindle Fire and probably won't be, as the Fire is so limited on onboard memmory. I have been a RoboForm user since its beta days and have hundreds of strong passwords I can't remmeber. LastPass isn't free, $12.00/year after the first 14 day trail. I does work good with the Fire once you setup the free desktop account, add your passwords and sync to the cloud, which in turn syncs to the Fire.<br /><br />LastPass is good and has very good reviews across the Web. They also own Xmarks which I also have used since the beta days, before LastPass bought it.  If your passwords don't look something like this, kmI$M1L8$qPRYuDOq!%WM, try LastPass and manage your strong-safe passwords.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This was ordered as a Christmas present. It came very fast and was a great price. My mom was so happy to get it. Great purchase, no problems.
1451648537|5.0|If you have any interest in computers (not just Apple), are interested in human psychology, business acumen, product quality, read this book. Jobs was an absolute genius as well as a first-class jerk and remained so throughout his life!
B003FSTN52|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows, so I was happy to receive the season so quicker.  I don't get to always watch them when they come on tv, so this gives me a chance to catch up.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's 21 is the best album that I have ever seen or heard in the past couple of years with the best selling album of both 2011 and 2012 that is still going strong with her voice look a goddess that sings to the amazingly beauty with its greatness and then some! BUY THIS ALBUM!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I just gave this to my husband, I bought it for him for when he deploys so far it seems really cool, the screen was bigger then I thought it was going to be and his Xbox 360 (old version) all the cords and a controller fit's great!! he has it set up right now testing it out and he said it's awesome!! it's very sturdy and I think it will be able to take some licks which is why I wanted to get it for him, to protect his Xbox while traveling...of course I'm thinking it will be great for at home too, maybe this means I'll get the tv back in the evenings lol!!
145162445X|4.0|I recommend this book to readers with some familiarity with modern physics or at least one who has been able understood other popular writing on physics or cosmology.  A reader looking for a general or philosophical treatment is not going to find comfort here.  While Krauss avoids mathematical or over-technical jargon, the concepts he is attempting to convey are not easily grasped by a general reader.  While intended to be a popular account it is not as easy as say something from Brian Greene.  Having said that, if you are comfortable with popular writing on this topic you will probably enjoy this book.  Krauss argues persuasively that what we know now about cosmology dramatically changes the speculations on how the universe originated that have been conducted by theologians and philosophers over the last couple of millennia.  Modern speculations cannot ignore these modern findings.  To do so would be like discussing illness without considering modern ideas like the germ theory of disease and claiming that disease is caused by demons.  Unfortunately some are still trotting out the ideas of people like Auinas.  In some ways this is both a depressing and an inspiring book.  I'm inspired by the magnificent progress in understanding cosmology that has occurred in the last century.  I assume others will be depressed by the utter lack of purpose or meaning that has resulted.  If you care about who we are and where we came from, then you can't ignore what Krauss offers in this book.  Recommended with the caveat about the general reader above.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is great! I was a little hesitant at first because of some of the reviews, but I am so glad I bought it! I work out on a regular basis (about 3-4 times a week) running and lifting weights, but Level 1 kicked my butt. I get bored with just going to the gym, and the 3 minutes of strength, two of cardio and one of abs keeps me interested. I was so sore the next day that I couldn't even think about going to the gym or doing the DVD again. I haven't felt that great/tired since hiking 9.5 miles straight up/downhill. My boyfriend made fun of me for being so sore after doing a \\"crappy workout DVD like his mother\\" that I bet him he couldn't do it with me. He tried and was really impressed it made him sweat and that he was still a little sore two days later. I was a little surprised that the workouts are longer than 20 minutes (almost 30) since everything on the packaging claims it is just 20 minutes a day. I can't wait to try the next two levels on the DVD, and I will definitely be buying more Jillian Michael's workouts!
B0063GORYU|5.0|love,love,love,love it..... highly addicitve. Definitely a great way to pass time and relax your brain to fall asleep... It rocks...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so addicted. It has a lot of entertaining games on here.  I have no problem with this app whatsoever.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I usually enjoy this style game but, I found this to be very monotonous and boring.  I have enjoyed similar g5 games.  But this one is awful and is not worth the 4.99 price.
B003L20ICE|1.0|So a movie is good if the male character is treated like garbage, I suppose... this review contains spoilers.  At the end, Mark Ruffalo's character is referred to as an interloper by Annette Bening's character.  He was not the one who interfered with anyone else's life, though.  They interfered with his life by seeking him out and getting in touch with him.  The message also seems to be that heterosexual sex is evil (because it involves a male) and lesbian sex is the purest, most saintly sex possible.  Would the people who like this movie be happy if all the men in the world just killed themselves right now?  Would that satisfy them?
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Arrived when it was supposed to, and works exactly as I anticipated, allowing me to \\"read\\" books with my grandchildren on the big screen TV.
B0054N73EY|5.0|with the mainstream music and so called \\"talent\\" that is out today (lil wayne lady gaga and all that other lousy techno rave music)......what happened to rock???? or instruments? remember when people played instruments??......no this album isnt Blood Sugar Sex magik its no Californication and no Stadium Arcadium its not uplift mofo either.....its called I'm with you and it has been with me ever since i bought it.....there is so much raw musical talent going on throughout this whole album its amazing flea playing piano and josh playing bass on happiness loves company is one of my all time fav RHCP songs to date That right there is classic rhcp thinking outside the box....it seems like bands and albums like this are better for musicians, you know people who still \\"play music\\" play meaning an instrument not a record player you push play on and make pre recorded sounds with....i would say buy it if your a musician lots of fun stuff to pick apart and really listen for.... if you like all that lame dj tweeker music out in the mainstream today dont get it the talent on the album will get you confused and mad at yourself cause you cant do it..........
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've ever played, considering that I got it when it was cheaper(shortly after Christmas and for 99 cents). It runs flawlessly on my kindle and i am giving it a 5-star review. Also, a significant number of people say they'll change their review once it works... WELL GUESS WHAT YOU HUNDRED OR MORE PEOPLE! IT WORKS NOW!(excuse my caps). I am loving leveling my lvl33 Orc warrior in my guild D4RKN3SS am getting a lot of help from my friends on the Arcadian server (a.k.a. slayyou, kutrite, those guys)and say that this game blew my mind considering it was on a tablet, I would pay ten dollars to buy this game its that good! The only downside is the needing to buy a subscription, but money is needed to pay people to launch updates!So I encourage you to go and buy this game, its worth your money and the hours of boredom it will save you, or the hours of productive time you'll waste but its very, VERY fun. :)
0765365278|5.0|This novel was just plain awesome.  Sanderson took a single novel, filled it with background information of the land, characters, and history; and added an incredibly complex plot and surprises!  I agree with the many... his best work yet!  (And his other works are outstanding!, btw).
B003F1WM2K|3.0|This isn't a review, but a question.  The printed book contains many photographs but it appears from the Kindle Sample that the pictures are not included in the Kindle edition.  Can someone who purchased the Kindle edition tell me----are the photos included--there are many, including an album of pictures at the end.....
0143119680|2.0|I think that the outline for this book was really something. It's an interesting take on the worn out vampires/witches/demons thing. It asks some interesting questions and, for once, promises to focus on witch lore and magic rather than a played-out vampire romance.   But the editors should have taken a look at the outline and handed it to another writer. A writer could turn a good idea into a credibly written novel with engaging characters. Instead this is 600 pages chock full mundane description about all the wrong things (the details of the main characters' leggings collection? please) and lacking details about key plot points (she flew? she flew! what was it like? how did that happen? how did it feel to the character?). The prose is written in that awkward, unengaging, dragged-out Twilight style that makes it entirely too easy to skip entire pages in an effort to find some real action (spoiler: there isn't much).   Each character in the cast starts out promising. However, the author's skills are not up to the job and most characters remain roughly drawn without enough detail or personality to bring them to life and fix them in your memory.  The biggest fail, or course, is the main characters. Both begin as a relatively unique take on what a witch or vampire could be in an alternative modern day. But the author makes the classic mistake of piling perfection onto her characters (she's the most powerful witch ever! she's a brilliant scholar! she's a star athlete! she's clever! independent! / he's beautiful! he's rich! he always looks impeccable! he's 1,500 years old and pow-wowed with Machiavelli, Darwin, the Knights of the Templar, kings, queens, popes, and basically the Who's Who of the last millennium) and the poorly written characters collapse under their alleged perfection. They're flat, boring, and without unique, distinct voices.
1451627289|5.0|Haven't read a Stephen King novel since college over 25 years ago! Picked this book up in the bookstore, read the jacket and it sounded good. Good, huh, this book was great!! Love, love, loved this book from cover to cover. If you have the idea that all Stephen King novels are horror/scary, you will be pleasantly surprised when you pick up this book. This is history meets time travel meets romance. Definitely a book to keep on my shelf and read again!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Nice game, fun to play and looks good. The problem is it crashes on me all the time. Every time i am about to solve a puzzle it crashes. I have yet to make it past two puzzles. Really pisses me off. Does this on my Droid Charge and my Kindle Fire. have uninstalled for now.
0439023483|5.0|This is a great book. Had me hooked from the beginning and I couldn't put it down. I really liked the characters and although the concept is not brand new it was still great. I just ordered the rest of the series and hopefully its as good at the 1st book.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|While many seem to compare this group to The Beach Boys, I feel they are much closer to the sound of early Crosby Stills and Nash.  It has much more of that late 60's style and you can almost hear Judy Blue Eyes Suite in some passages.  Just because someone does harmonies, does not automatically make them Beach Boy imitators.  I enjoyed all the tracks on this album.  My only complaint would be that they do get a little heavy on the reverb with the vocals.  Every song has that \\"sung in a cavern\\" sound except for one (Blue Spotted Tail) where the vocal is up front and very good.  Some of it reminds one of renaissance(the time period, not the group) music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although, while reading I got the feeling that the book was meant for a younger audience, I couldn't put it down. I am now almost 25. This book to me is a perfect combination of Orwell's '1984,' Death Race (the movie) and 'Gulliver's Travels.' It lands you in a future that seems all too real with revolutions, the worlds dependence on nature resources even more so, travels to lands we can only imagine, but have a hint of normalcy at the same time.
B000001FN3|5.0|This is not a review as I only have the original LP, bought two days ago.  I noted the comments concerning the music of Claude Debussy used in House of Usher piece, but I am wondering if The Raven isn't also borrowed.  In the 60's, I think '68, I heard a piece in the middle of the night that I swear had the same melody note for note as The Raven, although there was another movement that it went into.  So I am hoping that someone out there knows what I'm talking about, as this song has been haunting me for 45 years.  In any case, this is powerful music from start to finish.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I loved this movie...saw it 3 times in the theater before it came out in DVD.......two times since I purchased it!
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|I really liked the subject matter of this book but found the writing style not my cup of tea. First of all, the \\"bad seed\\" plot is really well executed. It wasn't cheesy or campy, it was an honest portrayal of raising and living with a psychopath. What shocked me were the amount of school shootings that are referred to in this book. As a public high school teacher, maybe I was in denial about all of it but the references in the book were truly disturbing.  The reason I'm not a huge fan of this book is that the writing was done in the form of letters to the protagonist's husband. Lots of narrative (I'm not an English teacher so not sure that's the right word,) and not a lot of action until the last 50 pages or so. I wish there'd been more time spent on the visits to Kevin, since those were the most compelling parts of the book for me.  Also, I'm glad I got this on a Kindle because there was A LOT of vocab I didn't know and the Kindle has that automatic dictionary feature. Don't get me wrong, I have a pretty good vocabulary and I read a lot but there were many words I have never seen before and I feel like they were out of place.  Anyway, I'd recommend it. It's a little slow going but very compelling. I wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading because I never knew what horrible thing Kevin would do next. And I anticipated the ending which made every click on the page dreadful.  This book definitely gave me a visceral reaction but it was a little long in the tooth for me. Worth the read but don't read it if you're looking for a pic me up!
B005N95JA4|5.0|First of all, thanks Amazon for the fast delivery here in Brazil (12 days before the estimated day). About the album, I'm a great Rolling Stones fan, so what can I say about a 12 bonus tracks from Some Girls era is that the \\"new\\" song are really AWESOME!!!! Too much pure Rock and Roll and some of the best Blues ever Stones has made. The quality of sound makes you fell as to listening a new record of the band. About the regular Some Girls album, I fell little diferences in some musics, especially in the mixing or volume of some instruments, but nothing that able the songs to sounds strange, the magic of that tunes are there again.<br /><br />Anyway, it's one of my Stones favorites and the bonus album is REALLY GOOD, so I would be really happy if everybody in the world listen this album instead of a lot of crap that people used to listen.

B004GJDQT8|3.0|This app is great, I can track my shipments, add to my wish list, search, buy items, etc.  The biggest drawback I have found, is that I can't see subscribe and save elegible items, I have to get on my computer to do that. And since I use subscribe and save widely, this is why I only give it 3 stars, because I want to be able to find the best deal on amazon right from my mobile device.
145162445X|5.0|The accolades are richly deserved and I highly recommend this book. First a couple criticisms:    Although the question \\"why is there something rather than nothing\\" arises often in theistic discussions, as is frequently mentioned by Krauss, I found the question gripping when I first heard it 30 years ago precisely because it was clear that \\"God\\" was not an answer to it.  That the universe somehow \\"is,\\" without any divine or other simple explanation, was exactly the enigma I found at once awe-inspiring and maddening.  Krauss focuses on traditional believers in his scientific defense, almost as though the question would disappear once the notion of God is dispensed with.  I think the educated community is long past that concern.  \\"Here I want to once again beat what I wish were a dead horse,\\" Krauss writes on p. 144, referring to theological explanations of the \\"great question\\".  In my view his wish was granted long ago, somewhere in the 19th century in fact, so that I was less interested in that aspect of his discourse.  Dawkins has written an afterword, and that evolutionist's brilliant books are also marred somewhat by an obsession with the same post-moribund animal.    What would be of much greater interest, for me at least, is some discussion of mathematical realism.  Is the mathematical world independent of the human mind?  How dependent is it on the physical world?  Why is there a mathematical \\"something\\" rather than nothing?  Physicists are understandably prone to skepticism regarding mathematical realism, but I think the book would be enriched by some treatment of the matter.    The main point of the book, however, is forcefully presented: the ancient ontological enigma has been permanently altered by scientific advances.  Krauss's rephrasing of \\"why is there something rather than nothing\\" into \\"How is there something rather than nothing\\" illustrates, in a nutshell, the profound change in thinking wrought by the revolutions in physics in modern times, particularly in the areas of quantum mechanics and recent inflationary models. This book summarizes, better than any other I have read, this sea-change in our intellectual history. Accompanying this thesis is a wealth of cosmological description, presented in a fresh and engaging manner.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This movie does a great job of relating how a small market team attempted to compete with the evil Yankees. It is based on a true story, or largely based on a true story. The story is great, the acting is great, and it was well shot. It was well written, and was one the best paced baseball movies that I have ever come across. Get it, and enjoy!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun... when you're hella bored, lol ;)&lt;3 some of the games are hard when using a kindle fire.... but its easy to get points.
B0017T4IG0|5.0|Really. When wil this movie come out on DVD for the US, in widescreen format? With all the bad movies that have come out this should be a no-brainer. Yes it's not timely as far as the technology but is sure is for the story of boy meets girl. It's one of the most fun movies to come out of the 80's. So would someone PLEASE bring this out on DVD.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|When you buy \\"Ultra violet\\" you are not buying it forever, its like renting it because it EXPIRES!  Pure JUNK!!!  Stay away from this scam!!
1926778103|5.0|When I got this book I already knew it was going to be a nice one, but this book is beautiful front to back, although the glue holding the binding was coming off but I was lucky to be able to melt it back together at  office depot and now my book is perfect love the and the art style. One more thing I am a huge art book collector so if I buy one from amazon I will review it, look for a review buy artlover for those  curious about art books that come out, 3 that I can suggest that are not out yet that I know I will buy are mass effect artbook, persona 3 and 4.
B003Y5HWJU|2.0|Purchased SEASON ONE mainly because it came from \\"THE SOPRANOS\\".After the first five chapters,was quite disappointed: it had fancy sets,nice period music and feel of same,but found it quite pretentious and empty,w poor character definitions which made it sometimes confusing and predictable.Am not planning to buy more \\"SEASONS\\".

B006OFN0BQ|1.0|Ultraviolet digital download is worthless. You cannot play it on most devices. Your ability to use it is extremely limited. More customer friendliness from the MPAA.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|By far my favorite movie of the year. We need more movies like this one that leave a good message in men. Men have been desensitized with all the sex that is been sold by the media. Even cars are sold with hot looking women, just to make us feel like fools and forget are real role. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Excellent movie.
B001F0RAL6|4.0|[[ASIN:0316069418 The Drop (Harry Bosch)]]  I have read all of Michael Connelly's books (or I think I have). Once in a great while you find a really terrific author. Michael falls into that category. For mystery writers, I don't think he's quite as good as Tony Hillerman but, then again, I haven't read anyone that is. That's just my opinion. I recommend all of Michaels books to anyone who enjoys sitting down and reading a book where the author knows his craft and will keep you interested right up to the last page.

The only difference is that Puller is still in the military, and Reacher is out, but has lots of \\"contacts.\\" The book was ok, except the constant use of acronyms made it difficult.  Far fetched tale (I hope) but interesting.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I randomly spotted this movie on the Amazon rental lists and gave it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised to see a full-length film with a pretty solid production value. My only real critical complaint was with Caveziel's acting, which I found stale and completely uninspired, but the rest of the characters easily made up for it.<br /><br />While the special effects are very obviously lower-budget than a lot of top Hollywood films, it never detracts from the story. There is a decent amount of humanity and emotional storyline involved, but that's not why I rented this movie. I wanted to see an alien and Outlander delivered. The alien was a fantastic creation, despite being a blend of many of the alien creature cliches we see these days (most derived from either Predator or the Alien series).<br /><br />As my title states, the movie leads in with a strong, character-driven first act that introduces us to the world we're watching. The second act is primarily action-driven, with a few violent confrontations that were choreographed quite well in my opinion. But then the third act begins, and the movie pulls out every cliched, overused, and uninteresting action movie mechanic it can to drive the story forward for another 20-30 minutes. It was entirely unnecessary, as I felt the movie could have reached an excellent conclusion without the additional storyline tacked on. It also betrayed the best feature the movie had going for it, in that the glimpses we get of the alien were detailed, but short-lived, and it was perfect that way. During the conclusion of the movie, the audience basically shakes hands with the thing and congratulates it on its gripping performance, leaving nothing to the imagination and everything to the special effects.<br /><br />This review primarily documents my complaints. I feel no need to document most of my compliments, as I think you should experience them yourself and watch this movie. It's not perfect, but it was a very entertaining 2 hours, and agreat fusion of the classic medieval army and alien creature-feature stories.

B003M696QS|5.0|This is a fascinating book, with insights into what seems to be the unknown. Having experienced an \\"out of body experience\\" whilst in hospital in my early 20's - this subject has always fascinated me and I could resonate with much that the author was saying.  This is a well researched book, that steps out of the comfort zone of many with it's subject and title, to bring to the reader a beautiful well rounded account of the experience and the quantam theory/science as we know it, of realms that scare many, but are very real to others.  Thankyou.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As beginning to get back into the swing of things, this workout is just want I needed.  I love Jillians way, she is very tough but in a good way.  She keeps you motivated.  Other reviews stated that her voice was annoying but it is way better to listen to her so that you can focus on your fourm and not the tv screen.  This video is a short full body workout, and is quite effective.  I can't wait till the end of the 30 days to put on my GAP skinny jeans :)  I am starting over today because I missed 2 days after being in the hospital with my sister after the birth of her first born.  I will be giving this to her when she is well enough to handle it!

B003E6K1VK|3.0|I ordered the E7 shortly after receiving my first pair of audiophile headphones, the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro (250 Ohm). The product packaging was top notch; absolutely stunning. The box that the device came in was so well made that there was a vacuum created as I slipped off the top of the box. The packaging inside was extremely impressive as well, with everything fitting tightly and neatly in its place. I had no worries about damage due to shipping.  The accessories were top notch. I was really floored by how much I got with the E7. A nice pouch to put it in when not in use, a band of some kind of rubberized material for wrapping around your E7 and mp3 player to keep them together, a nice manual, a small cable with one 90° termination for linking the E7 with your cell phone or mp3 player, USB charging cable with two toroids to keep EMI to a bare minimum. Everything looked, at first glance, to be very high quality.  Unfortunately, I was not so impressed with the device (and so I have since returned it). Not really the fault of the device, but anyone with high impedance headphones (like the 250 Ohm DT 770's) should be aware of the fact that this portable amp will not be able to drive your cans to ear splitting volumes. In fact, I was disappointed to find out that it was only ~5-10% louder than my PC with onboard audio. That wasn't the worst of it though... I may have had a defective device, but it seems like it may be a common failing for this model... At very low frequencies, regardless of volume level, the E7 DAC (could have been the amp as well I suppose) introduced some crackling and popping into the mix. Totally unacceptable... if nothing else, you buy this device for crystal clear audio, but my onboard audio from my work PC proved to be a better performer than the E7. Again, this may have been a single bad device, but I think I can recall reading similar problems from other owners of the E7. So take that for what it's worth.  I wanted to give the device two stars initially, but didn't because A) it is a portable device, with a tiny Li-Ion battery, and so, you probably shouldn't expect to get ample power for high impedance headphones from it, B) as I said, the packaging and accessory list was impressive and lastly, C) the popping at very low frequencies may have been an aberration, occuring in relatively few devices overall.

B000OONQ30|5.0|Not only do you have a great concert on this dvd, but there's special features!!! And if you're into classical music, then I'm sure you've noticed that a lot of operatic dvds seem to lack any kind of special features. The documentary included isn't just the boring stuff that goes into making such an event, but there's humor and moments that are pretty touching. I highly suggest this dvd for any fan of The Three Tenors or music in general!

B000SGGUWS|4.0|This book was recomended to me by my best friend. I was a little unsure about the book, so I waited a while before I actually bought the book. I bought it for a reasonable price on the Kindle Store, $8.99. Once I began reading the first page, I was instantly in love with the characters, author, and the story itself.   Sara Shepard gives SUCH great detail on everything! I could picture everything she mentioned in her writing in my head. She has written a whole series on the \\"Pretty Little Liars\\" novel. I highly recomend you read anything written by her.   The characters. Ah, the characters. I could relate them to my friends and others. Shepard gives each of the girl's point of view so you know what all the main characters are thinking and feeling.   The story plays itself out beautifuly featuring everything a perfect story requires. It includes romance, drama, thrillers, cliff hangers, and plenty of suspense.   I recomend you read this book only if you are 12 years old or older.   Hope you read the book! :)
B005DF2QMC|1.0|For Christmas 2011, I received a Db tech tape to digital converter. I finally got a chance to play with it the weekend of January 14-15 and was very pleased with the ease of use and performance.<br />Now this past weekend, January 21-22, I tried to use it again, only to find it is no longer working properly. It will record the first and maybe part of a second song before it plays and records a warbling/trilling in the audio. Thinking it may have been the tape, I tried several others with the same result. I then tried the same tapes in another tape player and the tapes played correctly.<br />I went back through the original paperwork looking for a troubleshooting guide and found none. There was no number to call with questions.<br />I have emailed Dbtech and they say they will replace it once I send them the order number from when it was purchased. (As it was a gift, I may or may not be able to provide that number.)<br />After reading the other reviews, I agree it is very cheap looking, but I will have to say for the one weekend it worked, I was pleased with its performance. However, I don't think it's too much to expect it to work for more than one weekend before becoming useless garbage.<br />UPDATE 02/23/12 - There was no hassle in getting a replacement. Dbtech sent a new unit and I had it within a week of emailing my complaint. I received an email from Dbtech asking if I was happy with the replacement. My response: Unfortunately, I can't say that I am happy with it either. The tape speed is not consistent, so the sound alternates between dragging and catching up. I would be willing to admit if the tapes were the problem, but I have had the same cassette deck since 1983, and they still play just fine on it. I'm just resigned to the fact that things just aren't made to last like they used to be. They are now sending ANOTHER unit. Maybe the 3rd one will be the one that works!

0545403359|5.0|I bought this book a number of years ago for one of my children and finished up reading it myself. I found that once it was started it was impossible to put down until the last page was finished. Having served with the military for a number of years I am well aware of the bond that can grow between animals and service personnel,(I think of dogs in Africa and the Balkans). I bought this copy for a friend in the USA who was brought up on a farm and still lives in a rural area knowing that she will get great enjoyment out of it.  A very speedy despatch and I would use this firm again.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|The big suspension of disbelief here (possibly even bigger than flying people and reading minds) is the complete re-writing of the X-Men history.  You'll need to go into this looking at it as a brand new story.  I've been an X-Men fan since the Secret Wars so I've got some attachment to the mythology, which is why I can understand how some people might have problems with this.  But get passed that and you're in for an excellent movie.  The plot and premise were solidly written, great acting action and the rest.  The thing I loved about this was that the story was more set in the real world rather than the fantastic X-Men universe.  Whereas past X-Men films dealt with super machines that were going to turn everyone into Mutants, experimental secret bases that created super soldiers or super cures that would make mutants normal again, this one dealt with the Cuban missile Crisis.  A real life scenario that brought a little more realism to the story.

B006DDU850|5.0|First time experience with this medium (MP3 Audio CD).  Discovered that my home CD player could not play this.  However, my automobile CD player did play it.  Also played very well on computer (Windows Media Player) where I could easily access stopping/starting locations.  However, in vehicle, much more difficult as the \\"skip\\" function recognized only the 4 main divisions of the CD.  One would have to manually \\"fast forward\\" through hours of real time data to find stopping/starting location.  I routinely do most of my listening in car on commute to and from work, however, I ended up listening to this primarily via computer.  Nice to have only one disc.  Great book!
B003Y5H574|4.0|I love Steve Carell and he certainly doesn't disappoint in Crazy Stupid Love. I think what I like most about this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It takes a fairly lighthearted approach to what may be considered a heavy topic and it does a great job!  I definitely recommend this movie.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I have viewed this movie (as well as the 1960 version) over 11 times and still come away with how wonderful everything came together. The story, the effects, the acting, and the wonderful music is a treat for the eyes as well as the ears.  I came away thinking what a great story of love, loss, and redemption. To me, this wasn't so much a story about a time traveler as it was a story of a man who finally realizes that all that glitters isn't mechanical in nature and that the love of another can transcend time itself.  Our story opens at a college somewhere in NY. The music takes you on a journey down a staircase and hallway to the classroom of one \\"Dr. Alexander Hartdegan\\". There we see the good doctor writing equations on the chalkboard, oblivious to his surroundings. Eventually the camera pans to show the good doctor is not alone.  \\"Haven't you forgotten something?\\" the stranger asks. The doctor is surprised and initially is not aware of either the time or his plans for the evening. Fortunately, one word snaps the good doctor back to the present; \\"Emma\\".  As the story unfolds we begin to understand the good doctor is, to use a more modern term, a \\"tech-geek\\". And, while his love of Emma is genuine, he is still distracted by any new contraption that captures his eyes. All that changes once Emma is gone.  The story is one of love lost and regained. All other aspects are just eye candy for the geek in us all. I personally loved it.

1451627289|5.0|I've enjoyed Stephen King's work immensely in the past, especially works like \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" and \\"Delores Claiborne\\", but wow!  \\"11/22/63\\" kept me on the edge of my seat to the point I almost called in sick to work one day to keep reading.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.  This book has all the action, suspense, and yes, romance of ANY great book you'd ever want to read but without some of the over-the-top gruesome horror that sometimes makes me lose interest in other books.  You will not be disappointed and you will root for Jake over and over and over again!

B0062NAX1U|3.0|I sat down to watch Courageous with great anticipation. Being a father of 2 boys, and being divorced, I know how important it is to be present for them. I was looking for this movie to provide positive affirmation of this reality. While the movie is heart wrenching, I openly wept, it fails miserably on hitting those that need the message the most. Divorced fathers. The movie producers chose to make the divorced father the villain. By trying to push two separate agendas, fatherhood and marriage, they lost a perfect chance to hook divorced fathers. You don't have to be married to make the \\"Resolution\\" to your children and God, presented in the movie. They could have easily switched a few characters around and this movie would have been a home run. All fathers would do well to make this resolution a reality in there lives.  All in all I liked the movie but can't give it even four stars because of the lost opportunity to affect those that need it most.
0439023521|4.0|For me, this was a \\"can't put it down book\\".  The premise is original and well developed.  The descriptions are both rich and brutal.  The ending was cruel because I wanted more and had to immediately download the next book.  I have to say this first book of the trilogy was great, the other two, not so much, especially the second one - full of teenage angst and over-thinking by the main character.  They might be more appropriate for younger readers than me.  Others have said it well in the reviews of the other two books.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|The story of Jane Eyre is well known - a poor, mistreated young woman falls for the guardian of the young girl to whom she is governess, but their romance is overshadowed by a dark secret from his past.<br />But a more lifeless rendition of this film I could not imagine. The actress who plays Jane Eyre expresses as much emotion as an icicle - and a very bored one at that -- while the actor who plays Rochester is as lively as a long buried corpse.  It seems as if the creators of this film, in fearing to go overboard with emotions, decided the best approach was to make a film utterly devoid of it all - except at the very, very beginning.<br />In the introduction scenes, we see crying...and whimpering...and crying...and whimpering. Then we switch to zombie mode. No one feels anything. Brocklehurst is perhaps one of the most passionate early characters, and he comes across as bored at best. Rochester and Eyre's interactions lack any spark; they are zombies reciting words in plain and flat tones. Jane Eyre's expressions rarely change. She has no kindness or warmth for Adele; indeed, one must pity the poor child who has to put up with such frigid indifference from both governess and guardian. After we meet Mrs. Fairfax, we find another character who doesn't quite look like she has passed into the spirit world yet - but only just. And Jane and Rochester continue to plod, disinterestedly, through the story, ruining every witty exchange, every moment of sadness or joy, with their languid and tepid acting.<br />One of my \\"favorite\\" scenes in this horror is the \\"this is my spirit addressing your spirit\\" exchange. Could a blander and less interesting spirit possibly exist? Here, at least, Jane manages to tilt her eyebrows upward to indicate some emotion, though her tone remains as frigid as ever. I suppose that counts for something.<br />Another is the \\"Forgive me. I'm worthless. How could I?\\"  line, after Jane finds out that Rochester is already married. Imagine someone saying, \\"I was going to pick up skim milk, but they were out, so I got one percent instead.\\" That's about the amount of emotion Rochester put into this. Maybe that's too generous. And no, I am not exaggerating. Preschoolers past their nap time could have done a better and more convincing job than these lifeless hacks.<br />There is a perhaps five minute or so window of time when the characters seem to awaken from death in order to show a bit of liveliness, and this is the space of time between the wooden proposal and the ridiculous revelation scenes. Never fear, undead lovers: they promptly fall back into their old habits. Or, perhaps, I am too cruel to the undead. This is so lifeless, it is somewhat akin to a zombie portraying a zombie portraying a zombie...portraying a zombie.<br />The Jane Eyre story is a great one, and the screenplay for this version isn't bad. It's the acting, though, that puts the nails in the coffin of this film's potential. If you want to see how truly atrocious a film can be while doing a fairly decent job with setting, scenery, filmography or screenplay, this is highly recommended. Likewise, if you have two hours of time to waste, or you'd like a visual aid to induce naps, try this. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and skip this masterpiece of tedium, in all its excesses of boredom.o pick up skim milk, but they were out, so I got one percent instead.\\" That's about the amount of emotion Rochester put into this.

0743289412|1.0|My paperback edition of this book is 636 pages long.  I am on page 325 and can't decide if it's time to throw in the towel or invest another 5 or 6 hours into finishing Lisey's Story.  First, it's absolutely true that the cutesy, made up words that Scott and Lisey's share bog the book down and the phonetic spelling of words used for some of the characters gives the readers zero credit for being able to \\"hear\\" the dialect without having it spelled out for them again and again and again.  Three hundred plus pages into it I still don't care much about any of the characters.  The main character and person who is telling us the story is Lisey.  I'm sure King wanted to portray her as spunky but instead she comes across as not that bright, shallow and self absorbed.  I haven't learned anything noteworthy that she's done with her life either before or after her famous writer husband's death.  Scott is a charming nut job who was abused as a child.  Maybe that explains a lot but we never really get to know him other than as Lisey's weird husband.  Lisey's sisters are all just various degrees of annoying.  I can second what other reviewer's have said, so far the only interesting character is the crazy red neck who terrorizes Lisey.  There are way too many flash backs interspersed with the present plot line and the book is choppy and uneven because of it.  I guess I've just answered my own question.  I consider myself a Stephen King fan but rather than waste any more time I'm going to move on to something that grabs me from page one.  Dean Koontz anyone?

B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted to wait to review this until I had actually done it.  Well - I'm on Day 28 and I highly recommend this DVD.  I thought I was in pretty decent shape, (I ride 40 miles on my bike), so imagine my surprise when I found myself panting and grunting the first time I did level 1!  That being said, I think the most important thing, is that I progress each and every time I do the workouts.  I started out with the easy modifications, but at this point, I'm doing all the \\"hard-core\\" moves.  Jillian pushes hard, but she encourages you to keep going. I have to say that my leg and butt muscles are tight and hard. Sorry - I know how that sounds, but it's the truth!<br />I'm on to Power 90 next, and after that P90X.  If you're serious about getting fit, this DVD is a great jumping off point.

Just watched -- more than once -- the TV series on DVD from UK. Highly recommended as food for thought. I am not ethnic West Western, but I am quite alright with thinking out of my ethno-cultural self, and be self-critical at times.  On that page where Professor Ferguson writes \\"... with their bewildering 431,286 characters to be memorized, ...\\", it is not clear to me whether he is referring to the number of characters contained in the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism, or whether he is referring to the entire repertoire of Chinese characters. As I understand, the total number of Chinese characters, including variant forms of the same characters and obsolete characters, is around 50,000 to 60,000 (fifty to sixty thousand). I am a Cantonese-speaking Chinese brought up in Hong Kong up to university level, so should know something about the language which would seem daunting to understand for non-Chinese speakers.  Written Chinese characters may be a unifying force uniting the diverse dialectal differences on the vast China land mass. That is the view of the contemporary Chinese aesthetician Li Zehou. Li also points out that written Chinese characters, one of his three source codes of Chinese culture, have served to ensure the continuity of Chinese civilisation. Chinese characters are not phonetic symbols, but ideographic entities. That is where Chinese characters' uniqueness lies (Cf. Li's essay in Chinese, Ming Pao Monthly, v. 40, no. 9, September 2005, p. 78-81).  And here we are talking about the traditional full Chinese characters, not simplified Chinese. These full Chinese characters, written or printed vertically in columns from right to left, have been the basis of the development of Chinese culture and history since their rudimentary beginnings as the oracle bone characters found on tortoise shells or shoulder bones of big animals. I am not sure, though, whether our characters have improved or retarded the advancement of Chinese civilisation. To be a literate Chinese person, learning a few thousand characters is all that is needed.  And another uniqueness of Chinese is that there is no tense structure as such, nor any inflections to be memorised or spelt correctly.  Incidentally and ironically, appreciation of the verticality of written Chinese comes from Japan, not from China (Cf. chapter 3 of Ishikawa Kyuyo's book, translated as \\"Taction: The Drama of the Stylus in Oriental Calligraphy\\" by Waku Miller, 2011).  Changing from the vertical text direction to the Western horizontal direction for alphabetically structured scripts is a good example of the need or fashion to copy the West. Yet clearly this demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of Chinese characters. Our verticality has not become extinct like some species in the animal kingdom. Vertical text is still widely used in Japan and some places in the world.
0316098329|5.0|Room by Emma Donoghue is a hard book for me to review. Because really, I just want to spout out random parts of this book that make it so great before just sighing at you and telling you to go read it yourself, because it's kind of a book that just needs to be experienced. But, I won't just blabber on at you.<br /><br />So Room. It's narrated by Jack, a sweet, smart and charming just turned 5 year old whose whole world are the four walls of Room and it's contents. The only person he's ever seen or spoken to is Ma, although Old Nick is probably real too (but not real real).<br /><br />I was very impressed with Jack and his voice. I've spent a lot of time around little kids at all stages of life and development, and most of the time, Jack is very much a five year old. The connections he makes, and the way he forms understandings is very typical of five year olds, as is the way he names things. Each wall is named (Door Wall etc), he sleeps in Wardrobe, eats at Table, etc. He does have a rather extensive vocabulary, but to me, that makes perfect sense. Ma has only Jack to talk to all day, and let me tell you- Baby talk gets old really fast. Ma mentions at one point that Jack has already heard every story that she knows, which means they talk a lot, and Jack is surrounded by words. Numerous studies have shown that children who grow up hearing language regularly will learn to speak earlier and will speak properly faster than kids who are rarely spoken to and/or who only hear the adults speak in that babbling baby talk. They also play the 'parrot game' which I loved.<br /><br />I was impressed with Ma. That would be insanely hard. I can't imagine what it would be like, first to be taken from my home and family and trapped in a small 11x11 room with the only visitor being the creepy older man who kidnapped and rapes me, but to add onto that a baby?! I don't know if I could have done it. And, she's done an admirable job raising him given her circumstances and her resources. That takes a very strong woman, and even though she wasn't perfect (really, who is) she did a good job and she tried so hard. The only thing I could never figure out was why she didn't escape. I know that sounds harsh/unrealistic, especially given the state of the room she was trapped in. But the door was locked using a number keypad, one on the outside, and one on the inside. If I knew I was going to be trapped for an indefinite period of time, I'd start pushing buttons. What else are you going to do?! Or listen to the number tones and try to figure out which he pushes each night. I kind of think she could have done something. But, that's a small thing.<br /><br />Overall, I was very impressed with this book. There were parts I didn't like, especially in the second half of the book, but for the most part, I loved it. I loved the word sandwiches and the way that Jack tried to take all the new information and assimilate it into ways he already understood. Overall, this is a book that makes you think, makes you wonder and makes you want to hug your kids a little closer. It's a strong book with a strong core of goodness to it. This is a book I would read again, just to hear Jack's voice., and even though she wasn't perfect (really, who is) she did a good job and she tried so hard.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|The peace officers have a tremendously difficult job, keeping the rest of us safe, while their own families could also use a little more of their attention.  Through a tragedy in one family, the soul searching father reveals a plan to bring his family through the hardships of life and to draw them closer to God.  His \\"resolution\\" catches on with his compadres, and soon they are all tested in ways that they did not expect.  There is action, humor, and drama, and an especially exciting first few minutes into the movie!!!  This is an excellent film, and reminds me greatly of my own 'peace officer' husband, Raul Reyes, who loved the Lord and recently passed away after his fight with cancer.  Every father would be wise in taking to heart the message of this moving film.[[ASIN:B0062NAX1U Courageous]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is petty tuna and I like the points system, but I think some games in it are just not worth it. Some games are only fun the first 35 times -_-

B00364K6YW|2.0|I eagerly anticipated the restored version of Pride and Prejudice, as my older version had gotten worn. However, I could not tell the difference in picture quality at all. Also, the restored version inserted the lead-in and credits before and after every episode, while the version I had only did at the beginning and end of each DVD (2 each total).  The new version has 6 lead-ins and 6 credits for a total of 12! Extremely annoying and unnecessary.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is purely amazing! its super fun and entertaining. if you like games, this is perfect for you no lie
B002YMWPUA|5.0|Very good movie. The dramatic effect of the subject is done very well and the actors have done an amazing job. Would highly recommend, very mature content and gratuitous frontal male nudity.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I honestly didn't expect much of this game, but it is alluringly fun after I actually took the time to play it. The game essentially plays off of a simple &quot;gather x and destroy y&quot; scheme, which they did well. The true beauty of the game really shines in the strategic element of transformation and alternative level designs. As you progress in the game, your level ups grant you assess to new characters that dramatically increase the tactics and strategy element of the game. This need for planning and tactics is further increased by changing level designs that alternate how monsters will come at you. Skill development is fostered by randomly giving you a character when you grab a muffin, so you have to at least have some knowledge of how play each one. As a nice bonus generally lacking in these types of games, characters can be leveled up 3 times making them substantially more useful when you have to use them. The game also adds a cutesy humor theme which downplays deaths and eases frustrations from not doing as well you sometimes would like. Overall, one of the best games I have ever played on the android... so much so that I took the time to write a lengthy review!

B000IU3XU6|4.0|Out there is a CD only and a CD/DVD version of the Awake Tour-Live (2 discs.) Both CDs have yelling, squealing, and whistling young ladies (at least I think they are young. I'm 53 yrs old & I leave my squealing for Josh at home.) It's a toss-up (I ended up buying both.) The CD with the DVD has 9 songs. The CD alone has 13 songs. Interestingly The CD (alone) doesn't have \\"Awake.\\" Also, the CD alone doesn't have \\"Pearls.\\" The CD alone has songs that aren't on the DVD/CD. They are \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\", \\"L'Ultima Notte\\", \\"Solo Por Ti\\", \\"Now or Never\\",\\"Un Giorno Per Noi (Romeo E Giulietta)\\",& \\"Lullaby\\". I bought the CD/DVD 1st & then saw that more songs were on the CD alone. Hopefully this review helps you to decide whether you want one or both of the available Awake packages. I suppose that you may have some of the missing songs from another source. I gave this 4 stars because the DVD has those missing songs.

0312370849|5.0|I read this book as part of my book club. Sarah's Key is both a wonderful book and a wonderful movie. However, if I had to choose one or the other, I would choose the book over the movie due to the book's increased depth into the story.<br /><br />Tatiana de Rosnay wove two complicated stories into one: a modern day France, and a France during Adolph Hitler's domination of Europe, and France's shameful cooperation with his regime by arresting and holding thousands of Jewish families at the Velodrome.<br /><br />Sarah, a ten year old Jewish child during the 1942 Paris Vel' d'Viv roundups and deportations, was horribly affected by the events that transpired and was left broken for the duration of her life. It is impossible not to be personally touched by Sarah's plight and deep sadness.<br /><br />By bringing the modern day character, journalist Julia Jarmond, into the story, de Rosnay managed to intertwine Julia and Sarah's lives, while making Sarah's life important to our current times, and to ultimately give Sarah's life resolution and value.<br /><br />For my book club, check out: [...]

After recieving the 2nd box set with the same issues, returned it for full credit.  Make sure if you do get this that you immediately check all disks for proper playing.  Kudos to Amazon for taking this back and re-imbursing my shipping expenses but would suggest if you really want to buy this get it from a Big-Box Store where it can be more easily returned at point of sale if not free of defects.

B004AUGJS8|5.0|For the person who enjoys suspense and thrillers, this is a great movie! It started out with seemingly innocent and real romance (almost too good to be true, it might have seemed to Katie McCarthy).  Without giving too much away for those who haven't watched it yet, David turns out to be a psychopath who suffers mentally from witnessing an accident involving his mother and completely folds as Katie spends her life with him. His emotional instability becomes evident when they discuss the topic of children and David behaves oddly, and when he has demonstrates violent behavior. There are other signs he is emotionally unstable which become apparent. Note that David Marks is only the character name as is Katie McCarthy. At the end of the movie, an indication that the individual whom David Marks plays is still alive and has been in and out of jail.  Wow, I am shocked that the case of the missing wife  (represented by the character Katie McCarthy) along with the murder of David's long-time female friend are still unsolved. And I was even more shocked to read about how the jury had found \\"David\\" not guilty of the crime even after he admitted to dismembering the body! The legal system in this country seems to be lacking when I hear about cases like this. This movie also makes me want remove myself from anyone that might be classified as a pathological liar...

B0059XTTW8|4.0|The anti-Bond spy movie, from the book by John Le Carre. Gary Oldman plays Smiley, an ex British intelligence agent who's called back on the job when his former boss (John Hurt) suspects the presence of a mole in his department. You have to go into this expecting a deliberately paced movie that doesn't spoon-feed you the whole plot. It's not action-packed. It's not about the sexy gadgets and unbelievable action sequences, but the withered perseverance of an aging spy who may not be sexy or hyper-masculine, but makes up for that in sheer intelligence and mental fortitude. It would have been nice, I suppose, if this movie had been a little faster paced at times, and there's a certain Britishness to it that reeks of stuffy good manners, and yet the movie is totally absorbing, even when it's difficult to follow. It has an actual mystery to it, which is something you generally don't get from a Bond picture. And Gary Oldman is a convincing lead, a bit embalmed perhaps, but he gets his character's human side across nonetheless...

B004GGTAQE|3.0|\\"Tigers in the Mud\\" is an odd book in English; it reads as if it has never been edited for conciseness, clarity, or continuity. I don't know if these faults are in the original German or if they are the product of a poor translation.<br /><br />Mr. Carius nevertheless had some experiences that are worth sharing. His accounts of individual battles are interesting, and his views on tactics, and recon in particular, are fascinating. I would have appreciated more details in some cases and more maps throughout. He did hand draw a map of one particular battlefield, but I was unfamiliar with many place names mentioned as the sites of other battles.<br /><br />What I found most compelling about Mr. Carius' memoir/essay was the degree to which he views himself and his comrades as loyal soldiers forced to defend the fatherland against the seemingly unprovoked aggression of other nations. He seems to believe that the invasion and occupation of western Europe and much of the Soviet Union were defensive operations. He apparently never heard of the Holocaust, or any of the lesser horrors which the Nazis inflicted on other tens of millions of Europeans for nearly six years, under cover of his and his comrades' military prowess. Allied bombing and Soviet rape and pillage of German civilians, on the other hand, are prominent in his narrative.<br /><br />Mr. Carius decries the contempt with which he feels veterans such as himself have been treated in the postwar world many, many times throughout this book. He also argues that the western Allies should have let bygones be bygones once they reached German borders, and joined forces with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union.<br /><br />He seems puzzled by American reliance on artillery and tactical air forces, but respects Soviet willingness to pay for every kilometer with buckets of blood. He often expresses disappointment in his own infantry comrades for their hesitation to absorb similar punishment, which strikes me as unfair when he went into battle wrapped in 60 tons of steel. To his credit, he did his recon work in a Kubelwagen, and was severely wounded during one such mission.<br /><br />There are plenty of photographs of Tiger tanks for their fans. His description of the practical immobility of the Hunting Tigers in which he served on the western front during the closing months of the war perfectly illustrates the gap between the overwhelming superiority of (individual) German AFVs on paper and their actual, aggregate performance.<br /><br />He describes personally receiving a medal from the hand of Heinrich Himmler, and found Himmler to be a pretty nice guy doing the best he could at an admittedly tough job. Given his own access to Himmler with a loaded pistol on his belt, he concludes that the group that attempted to assassinate Hitler were not serious. He offers no opinion on whether or not it would have been a good thing had they succeeded.<br /><br />I thought about putting this book down in disgust several times. I kept reading, however, wondering if Carius would ever look himself, and the war in which he proudly served, in the eye. Spoiler alert: He does not. That was the unexpected takeaway for me in this work.steel. To his credit, he did his recon work in a Kubelwagen, and was severely wounded during one such mission.

B005FITIGO|4.0|Margin Call takes place over about a 24-hour period in which a New York investment bank foresees the impending financial crisis of 2008 and tries to save itself, effectively screwing over everyone else in the process. Kevin Spacey heads the cast as a middle man who grapples with the morality of selling out at the cost of so many other companies' very existence.  It's a grimly keen assessment of Capitalism; a lovely little tragic-comedy full of lonely figures in business suits trying to hold on to as much of their money as possible. All the business-world jargon that confuses most of us in real life sputters out of the lips of the characters in this movie with irony: half the time no one knows exactly what is meant by \\"volatility index\\" and the like. You keep waiting for the movie to translate it for you. Even the big boss (Jeremy Irons) asks for plain English when a meeting is called to discuss how to deal with the storm that's brewing...

B00136Q2C0|5.0|When Bruce Springsteen went into the aftermath of the 1984 \\"Born In The USA\\" tour two key things happened in his life. His marriage to actress Julianne Phillips ended, and Bruce stepped away from the E Street Band. This was a huge turning point in his life as he approached forty.<br />Thematically, the songs reflect on love gone wrong, and holding oneself together under tough circumstances. I've always considered \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" one of Springsteen's top 5 albums, the reason being it was a step away from his story telling songs and a searing soul bearing of his own life.<br /><br />For the first time listeners get a glimpse of the man behind the musician, and the powerful admissions of not being in control of his own life and love. Musically, a good portion of the record was made singly by Springsteen himself, occasionally relying on E Streeter's to fill in the spaces in certain songs. In addition it's the first recording where Patti Scialfa strong vocal presence is heard in several songs prominently. Although she was a backup singer in parts the lengthy Born In The USA tour, along with the addition of Nils Lofgren in his role as a step in guitarist. This was the first time introduction of the newbie \\"members to be\\" of the E Street Band.<br /><br />The popularity of Tunnel OF Love was not on par with Born In The USA, nevertheless, singles emerged from it like \\"Brilliant Disguise\\" and \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" that were hits on the rising video wave created by MTV. In all four of the albums twelve songs were made into videos shot on location in Asbury Park. Tunnel Of Love was a necessary turning point in Bruce Springsteen's life, it cemented his relationship with Patti Scalfa,who later became his wife and mother of his children, and it brought forward a more mature and serious Bruce Springsteen who no longer had the image of the \\"lone wolf\\" edgy rocker who's single purpose was to be the \\"Boss\\" of the band.

0061673730|5.0|This classic work of philosophy, published in the early 1970s, is an interesting read for someone who was never a philosophy major. Robert Pirsig draws on his own philosophical training, plus his experiences with major psychological disorders, and a crops country motorcycle trip he took with his teenage son and some friends in the late 1960s to meditate on the meaning of \\"quality\\" and technology. Pirsig writes in the first person, but also includes flashbacks and visions of himself before he had a major psychological breakdown, in the form of a character he calls \\"Phaedrus.\\"  Some of the discussion can be hard to follow for those without extensive experience reading philosophy. That said, it was enjoyable, and some of his commentary on technology and the modern world seem just as relevant in 2012 as they were in the early 1970s. I recommend this book.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I heard nothing but praise for Pocket Informant before purchasing this app. After purchasing it, I found that it doesn't work at all with Android Ice Cream Sandwich. On the Xoom, the app fails to load any Android sync data, except Google Tasks. On the Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus, the \\"Settings\\" menu fails to load, crashing the app. Also, the Google tasks data doesn't load on either the Nexus S or Galaxy Nexus. When it crashes, it doesn't even offer the option to report it! So far, I've been unable to use this app.  It's been months now since Ice Cream Sandwich was released, there's no reason why the app shouldn't have been updated to fix its incompatibilities by now.  UPDATED: WebIS has updated Pocket Informant for ICS and, I have to say, I love the app! It's very easy to use, feature-filled, and extremely configurable. I recommend Pocket Informant.

B001FB55I0|1.0|I'm a fan of the first two Terminator films.  T2 is a brilliant piece of cinema, in terms of both special effects and plot.  The character development in the script, and the subsequent performances by the actors, was leveraged superbly by director and franchise creator Jim Cameron.  Even Ah-nold kept it together enough to portray a cyborg as something more than a one-dimensional machine.<br /><br />So it was with some anticipation that I purchased the (hopefully) LAST installment in the Terminator franchise: Terminator Salvation.  It's depressing to note that, for the $200 million it cost to make this film, 500 college students could have had a 4-year free ride to Stanford, and we as a species would be significantly closer to a cure for cancer.<br /><br />Alas, not so.  This film is devoid of any perceivable cinematic value, other than as an excuse to blow stuff up for two hours.  Given that director McG is famous for pyrotechnic stunts and infamously weak in plot and character development, I should have known what to expect.  But here's what I didn't expect:<br /><br />****** WARNING: SPOILER ALERTS ******<br /><br />-- Endless cheesy homages to the original Terminator films: \\"Come with me if you want to live;\\" \\"I'll be back;\\" fleeing from danger in a mini-camper; one-armed shotgun pumping (btw, Sarah Connor did it because her other arm was BROKEN, not because it was \\"cool,\\" Anton); a factory battle-to-the-death featuring molten steel and a \\"frozen\\" terminator; and, sadly, more.<br /><br />-- Endless cheesy homages to classic films in general.  The elevator ride in the big climax before Skynet goes (predictably) boom, a la Sigourney Weaver in Aliens; McG's own characterization of the escape of Markus, Star, and Kyle Reese from the ill-fated desert gas station (oh, and yeah--just like in T2--a boy, a female, and a cyborg seek shelter in an abandoned desert GAS STATION) as being \\"like the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow\\" in the Wizard of Oz, in which they \\"ease on down\\" (The Wiz) \\"the yellow brick road\\" (The Wizard of Oz) in their escape (I'm surprised he failed to liken the motobots chasing after them as flying monkeys).  Disturbing, however, was McG's literal on-camera reference to a moment in which cyborg Markus heads into danger instead of fleeing as being \\"just like the firefighters in 911, who we homaged in that scene\\" (I kid you not -- see the Blu-ray theatrical release disc's extra features).<br /><br />-- The inability of Sam Worthington to decide whether he should deliver his lines with an American accent, or his native Australian accent; and the inability of McG to direct him either way (maybe he was elsewhere on set blowing stuff up).<br /><br />-- Christian Bale's mono-dimensional performance of John Connor, in which he appeared less animated than a T-600 and uninspired to deliver his lines in any voice other than a hoarse shout.<br /><br />-- The completely galling, almost giddy revelation of Anthony Simonaitis, the Key Powder Foreman (again, watch the movie's popup-enhanced Blu-ray version) that, while filming the gas station demolition scene in New Mexico, \\"we had to keep a 50-feet column of fire (burning) for 2 more days; (so we) built a steel framework, hooked that up to a fuel tanker ... and burned 2000 gallons of fuel over the course of 2 days.\\"<br /><br />McG: The Ozone Layer just called; it wants its atmosphere back.<br /><br />If there was an Oscar for Blowing Stuff Up, Terminator Salvation would be Academy-worthy.  Otherwise, this film represents nothing more than $200 million up in smoke.ard of Oz) in their escape (I'm surprised he failed to liken the motobots chasing after them as flying monkeys).

B004MC8CA2|2.0|the.app is ok except that u can not flip the pages by sliding ur fingers across the screen. which makes it a lot harder to use:(
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I did enjoy this movie, but felt as though parts of it were cut out to make the movie go faster. I would have enjoyed it more if the story didn't seem to jump so abruptly from one moment to the next. Overall a good film.

0062082353|2.0|I would like to thank Chris Kyle for his service to this country.  I ask that he supports his brothers and sisters that continue to serve.  If you are a \\"Yankee\\", don't purchase this book.  By far the worse book I have read since the age of four (Green Eggs and Ham was the first).  I will finish reading this book before I donate to a book store or toss in my recyclable bin.  I supported my \\"brother\\" by purchasing his book, but I wish I would not have now.  I have read several books written by my \\"brothers\\" and it's very hard for me to accept this book.  There are several stories in this book that are not true.  The Uniform Code of Military Justice, the Code of Conduct, Navy Core Values and several of \\"our\\" creeds would not condone the type of behavior displayed in this book.  This is my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|constant games to play.  Different ones for all ages.  Keeps you on your toes.  You never want to stop playing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game to pass the time. some of the games are silly. but i enjoy playing it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|well this game is really cool because it has tones of fun games for only 1app and I just really like that about this game...but sometimes it gets kinda repetitive...so yeah!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|great for preschoolers.  used this with the kids I nanny for. keeps them busy especially. in car pool line. give it a try.
0545265355|5.0|Great trilogy--has every aspect you could want: romance, suspense, fighting, etc.  Couldn't put them down.  My husband loved them as well.
B002VPE1X4|2.0|I bought this camera case for this camera: [[ASIN:B004HW7KBY Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH5 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)]]. The camera fits inside but the case is very bulky and much too big for the camera.
1881273873|4.0|This book was extremely good. I had heard about the \\"Five Love Languages\\" from a CD I bought from Christian Book Distributors. Reading this book has really helped enhance my relationships! I am now more kind with my words, I know exactly which love languages makes me feel the most. I have tried this book out with my relationship with my friends, but it can work for any relationship. Warning: some of question truly requires you to be truthful to get the most out the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the game it is fun to try and beat each game have a friend she likes it she is going to see if she can put it on her. I pad.  my transmits also like this
0517543052|2.0|Sorry all, but I found the layout of the content to be incredible displeasing. I don't have the patience to flip a bunch of pages up and read a bunch of scattered oversized words, not even in cohesive sentences, amidst weird drawings. Maybe if I were on acid, but seriously, as a means to find relaxation among a stressful day, trying to read that and make sense of things will honestly just make my head hurt even more. It's creative and funky, I'll give that, but it really should be re-published in a more conventional layout. The 'tripped out' drawings can be put in the margins and the main words put where they should be. I dunno. I don't exactly have time to make sense of things, sadly. If it's not accessible easily, then no matter how 'creative' or 'trippy' it is, it's essentially useless to most people who come across it, except the most dedicated, patient, and time-flexible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am addicted to this game. I play all the time. my husband tells me I play too much. but this game will keep someone occupied for days.
0345505387|1.0|I got this through Amazon as soon as it came out, thinking of other graphic novels that are so good. Wrong. The art work was Ok but too cartoonish and not dark enough, and all the characters looked too Asian and did not capture the characters. Would of done better in a B&W copy (like From Hell) printed on pulp paper, therefore have more panels and more of the story, not that shiny stuff that no doubt made it so expensive. And the the story was....blah. The graphics (drawing, colours, etc.) bothered me the most. Too pastoral.
0525478817|5.0|I knew going into The Fault in Our Stars that this was going to be one of those books that had me completely raw and broken at the end. Even so, I was not prepared for how thoroughly John Green did this--and I loved every second of it.  Hazel Grace Lancaster has been terminal since she was thirteen years old. Whether she would die was never a question; now, with the \\"miracle drug\\" Phalanxifor shrinking her tumors and keeping her cancer under control, the question is when she will die. Hazel's reaction to this is not unreasonable--she sinks into torpor, watches tons of America's Next Top Model, reads her favorite book and waits.  Then, she meets Augustus Waters, gorgeous Survivor with a capital S, and slowly but surely, she begins to fall in love.  Overall, this story is a beautiful one--life affirming, even, despite the death which hangs over so many of the character's heads throughout the course of the book. The characters are very real and very raw; they are not the stereotypical \\"brave\\" cancer patient that Hazel details at several points in the book. They are brave, for sure, but they are also broken, afraid, lonely, and angry. Not a single character in this book is spared from the harsh reality of the ending--even the non-sufferers are affected, just as is the case in real-life cancer cases. And at the very heart of the story, there is a romance between two doomed children who haven't really had the chance to experience life, and who are determined to do so one way or another. Mixed in with all this bleakness are sparkling moments rather like the titular stars, the hilarious and heartwarming blended smoothly with the darkness and blood and Hazel Lancaster's struggling breaths. John Green has definitely crafted a book for the ages here, and there is not a person in this world that would not benefit from reading it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this app!!  I am to read the word and apply it to my life!  I highly recommend it.
0061537969|5.0|Garth Stein's \\"The Art of Racing In The Rain\\" is the beautifully captivating story of a man's life, told through the eyes of his faithful companion, Enzo. The story touches several different aspects of his owner's life, from bachelorhood, his career as a racecar driver, through marriage, the birth of his daughter, loss, and the biggest fight of his life. I found myself unable to put this book down. Pet owners and animal lovers will find themselves enthralled with this story. It is absolutely a must read!
B004EPZ02A|5.0|DIFFINATLEY a great addition to the franchise. The whole movie is utterly entertaining and followed an amazingly smart storyline. Has quite a few moments in witch the viewer will JUMP out of fear! The ending is also like the others leaving you with questions to be answers and needing a change of underwear. I highly recommend this movie and Conno pack especially if you liked the first two!!
B006MHWXMS|4.0|This app really helps me keep track of my assignments at school. The lists are great for keeping track of individual classes, and it has all the right features for an organizer. My only complaint is the lack of some sort of day planner functionality.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|...This CD will put you in the Spirit of Christmas! Michael Buble is one of the best artist in the Business!  The sound quality in his voice is sensational, and his musical delivery is entertaining and sincere.
B0034G4P94|5.0|this movie is awesome. i didn't think that i was going to like this movie, but i enjoyed it very much. i respect the actors for all they went trough to make this movie, and in what little time they made it in. this movie is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Absolutely love this app! Works just like it says, and the responsiveness is simply amazing. So glad I got this app.
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|It's good toe tapping music, can't wait to put it on my MP3 player so I can listen at work! Down side was the packaging: it came in a folded up cardboard enclosure, not the usual plastic case I'm used to.  Kudos for going green, but I'm worried that constant removal/replacing will damage the disc.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Bought to use with an XM SkyDock, iPhone 4S and Griffin Elan Form Graphite case. Adapter is long but SkyDock is designed to hold the unit in place. I've had no issues with sound quality or with stability. Unit also works well with my wife's iPhone 4S using a similar case and a USA SPEC iPod adapter.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is the kind of film you expect to see produced in another country but rarely expect produced in the USA. Artful, intellectual, moving, reflective, and sadly, probably not for mainstream USA audiences. If you have seen other Malick films you expect something artful and this may be his best yet!!!  I watched this film after it was released on Blu-ray. From the opening suggestion \\"For optimal reproduction, the producers of this Blu-ray recommend that you play it loud,\\" I knew sound was going to be a significant part of the experience.  And it was!  Both the full sonic use of classical music (perfectly paired) and the hushed voice-overs were enhanced by \\"big sound.\\"  The visual experience was equally stunning (as you expect from Malick). From camera angles and lighting to amazing use of computer generated animations you are transported to a very real (but seldom explored) place inside of you.  From the opening moments you are offered two perspectives of life and the conflicts and resolutions of those two perspectives....\\"grace\\" and \\"nature.\\"  Throughout the film Mom presents \\"grace\\" and Dad is as \\"nature\\" would have him.  This dichotomy is presented broader in natural scenes, evolution and human interaction.  Having been a child of the 50's this film resonated with me portraying what was naturally expected of children in the 50s. Dad was the Lord of the house and saw his obligation to make men of his sons (I was one of two boys). And mom brought \\"grace\\"  into the family whenever possible; joyful moments circumventing the father's natural structured oppressive leadership.  This film profoundly captured my memories of childhood in the 50s and presented both the conflicts of youthful adaptation to fatherly expectations, motherly love and the later struggles to make renewed (more balanced) visions for our adult selves.  I also found myself reminded of wondrous youthful first time revelations when I noticed things like running, chasing, sounds, smells, the feel of rushing water, the magic of butterflies, the thrill of climbing a tree, and many other wonder-full  moments of first awareness...this film is an emotional banquet of discovery and re-discovery and for forming.  Buy this Blu-ray.  You will want to watch it again and again and share it with your friends who value film as art, family, music, emotions, subtlety, and the search for balance in life.
1592536913|5.0|I was so impressed with this book.  It is packed with great pictures and ideas.  We love to go to the Renaissance Faire and this year I'm going to go all steampunked out.  I can't wait to start creating my own masterpieces!  Highly recommended!
1400052181|5.0|I read this non stop in one day. Could not put it down. This is a scary, fascinating, true story. Do yourself a favor and read it. Then ponder (specially if you have had any type of surgery done): where is the part of me that was taken? where did it go? Did I become yet another test subject without my knowledge or consent? The book is extremely well written. Read it. You won't forget it. It won't let you.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The connection is fast scales well but the scroll by two finger drag doesn't work.  This seem to be a problem with logmein also.  The solution is simple.  The gesture should use two fingers:  the first holds down on the component and the second slides to emulate a wheel.

160094048X|5.0|So far I have made just 3 recipes out of this book, but those three recipes have be insane good! I made the Ooh-la-las, hot chocolate snicker doodles, and just made the chocolate chip cookies tonight. All have been outstanding! My poor omnivore hubby has had to taste some not-so-successful vegan attempts at cookies, and tonight he said these cookies were so good. He said, \\"See what happens when you stray from vegan baking? These are REALLY good!\\"... Well he ate those words as soon as I informed him they WERE vegan! I am so thankful for this book, to show all the non-believers that veganism is just as easy and delicious as non vegan foods. Hot chocolate snicker doodles are still my favorite though... So far. :)

B006ZBRMOU|4.0|Wow... I gobbled this up over the course of a weekend and had to try to slow myself down, so that I didn't gorge on it... I'd been waiting months for this to come out, the final part of the Fifty Shades trilogy. Part 2 ended on such a cliffhanger, I was on tenterhooks!<br /><br />Annnddd... while I loved it - Christian Grey is soooo addictive - I felt a little disappointed too. Partly that the trilogy has now finished, but partly because I didn't get the same intense rush from this book. The first two were so emotional, you jumped on a rollercoaster and couldn't get off until the ride ended. We saw Christian Grey in all his fifty shades of messed up. And loved him even more as he grew and developed.<br /><br />I think Fifty Shades Freed had too much happiness in it. True, there were little flashes of Angry Fifty or Sulky Fifty, but the first half was essentially Happy Ana and Happy Fifty settling down together to marital bliss. For me, it all got going at 73%. The emotions surged. The primal fear and anxiety ratcheted up another notch, and another... I couldn't put it down at that stage. And I think that was over too quickly. I would have loved that to be drawn out, for the reader to be teased for longer, for the pain and distress to be amplified even further. I felt a little cheated that EL James made it all better, so quickly. There were still a few reveals after that, but nothing to get too worked up over.<br /><br />Having said that, I LOVED the ending. The little snippets of Christian's POV have been delicious to read, to see inside his head, and I'm glad that FSF ended the way it did. 4 / 5.
B004LUS390|1.0|I just updated this, now it doesn't work anymore!!!  it was worth 5 stars before, but they better fix this!!!!!
0439023483|5.0|AMAZING! One of thee best books I have EVER read. I just finished reading it about 10 minutes ago and I'm already anxious to start the next book.  It is nothing like anything I've ever read before, and sends you through so many feelings and emotions. I would recommend this to anyone who asks! It's a must read, for sure! At first I wasn't sure I would be interested because of it's theme but once I got into it, I really couldn't put it down.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I know rick riordan is a fantastic writer and when i had heard he had come out with a new book i knew it was going to be good. I was not expecting it to be this good. This series deffinetly will top the percy jaclsom series. If you have never read on of rick riordans book i saggest you start with the red pyramid. Whats so good is there is always somethong that is unexpected ay every turn. Any thing can happen in the world of the gods.    if you like the red pyramid i suggest you read the second book in the kane cronicles the throne of fire. it isnt as good as the first book but it is good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has a lot of fun stuff packed into it. I like that you have to unlock a lot of the game to make it a bit more fun. Some of the game didn't respond as great as I would've liked though, but it's still fun.
0792163710|5.0|George Stevens had more heart than any director from Hollywood.  Shane is one of the best examples of that.  Alan Ladd's best performance no doubt...laconic but polite.  And Brandon a real joy!  Beautifully filmed.  Accolade well deserved for a film that will last forever.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|I received a very good price for this series on blu ray through Amazon and it was worth every penny. This show was a rare jewel in today's field of mindless, insipid and vapid  television programs. I really think the producers should consider re-making the orginal series at the time of the height of the Cylon War just before the colonies are destroyed. Given the level of talented writers and an actors they were able to recruit for this past series they would be able to crown their success with another blockbuster hit.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this to my Kindle fire. It works great! This is a game I always go to when I want to play a quick game or kill time. Definitely a favorite.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|A wonderful furturistic romp through the concept of Messianic deliverance (complete with a Cyber Judas). Highly recommended and if you didn't understand the second movie (which is the general complaint I read about all the time) I suggest you watch it a couple of times until the core idea behind it sinks in.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I kinda like this game... the games are fun but a little repetitive. overall a pretty good game to play. worth a download. Kindle.Fire
0062101897|5.0|One of my co-workers bought Harry Potter, Page to Screen, from Amazon.com for Christmas and I saw it and had to have it. Great price on Amazon.com. It's $75 in bookstores but I got it on  Amazon.com for $39.99 and free shipping. Outstanding book telling about all the Harry Potter films, how they were filmed, the characters, the props, the buildings, how they did everything. Very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the Harry Potter films.
B005HP2JAM|5.0|I bought this Blue Ray DVD for my husband the history teacher for Christmas, and we have both enjoyed seeing the miraculously preserved cave dweller artistry of 30,000 years!  I heard about it on NPR and knew he'd love it.  I wasn't wrong.  The way the pictures were made to conform to the surfaces of the cave make them almost come alive.  And we think we know so much in our 'modern' world!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Always fun and challenging.  Easier using one suit but more of a challenge using multiplies.  Great game and very entertaining.
0439023521|4.0|I really do not understand the people who think that this book does not have substance or is too shallow and action-oriented. Katniss is a complex character who represents the moral conflict involved in such a complex situation. I dont know if people are expecting her to be some kind of great hero who somehow wins the games and saves the lives of every contestant, but that is impossible here and she, like every other contestant(except one, wont spoil it here), puts her survival before all else. Still, she is conflicted by feelings of friendship toward other contestants and this internal conflict is revisited throughout the story. She is confronted with the choice of faking romantic feelings for another contestant in exchange for gifts that will help her survive. Is this really such an amoral thing to do when you put it in perspective? The kicker is that those feelings begin feeling real, and she simultaneously wants to pursue them and avoid them, weighing the costs to both herself and others. The morals involved in this story are complex and undefined. Those looking for black and white, right and wrong, good vs. evil will not find it here (exception being the obviously evil capitol). Ironically, they are the ones calling this story and its character shallow when really the characterization of Katniss is about as realistic as such an unrealistic scenario could provide. Which brings me to my next point: realism. This is a science-fiction novel, and i have come across reviews complaining about it being unrealistic. One person said the author knows nothing about medicine. Guess what? We dont know anything about what kind of medicine may exist at any time in the future that this story is taking place. Obviously, they have medicine that can do things that no medicine can do now. Its fiction, shes allowed to make stuff up. All in all, this is a very good book with exceptional pacing and a great balance of action, detail and substance that will leave you unable to put it down. I look forward to the rest of the trilogy
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the things I can do with this app...only downside I have noticed is that some words in the NIV on this aren't the same as my NIV Bible. I am loving the plans option to read the Bible in a year...looking forward to trying some of the other features.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|It's Woody Allen at his best!  Owen Wilson was perfect in the role and the film was delightful.  I think it could have gone on for another half hour because the charm and the fantasy were perfect!!
0446615625|3.0|Some parts were very interesting and played out at a great pace but I am curious to see how the characters evolve from here.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I really felt like this movie was a waste of my time.  I enjoyed the intellectual crowd from the past but the overall story line was weak.  I think only Woody Allen could have gotten away with this...and I normally love Woody Allen.  To just dress up a few folks as our intellectual heroes from the past and think this makes a movie is not good enough.  The over wrought food for thought here (that no age is good enough for those who live in it) is just too simplistic and certainly not very informative (didn't we all already know that?) I would not waste my time and certainly not my money on this one if I had it to do over.  Unless you are a Woody Allen cultist and must see everything he does...forget it.  Sorry Woody...
B0019KC4UE|5.0|One of the best albums of the band and sound in this version with DTS and Dolby Surround was spectacular. In the hybrid CD (SACD) is a wonderful remastering with bass in mind. The first three songs alone are worth the CD. The DVD also features videos of the day with good images for the recording in 1973. Excellent version.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I love this app. You can travel the world and see beautiful scenery and what's going on in other parts of the world, right from the comfort of your own home!
B004EPYZXK|3.0|I didn't see \\"Apollo 18\\" when it hit the theatres in September 2011 because it garnered almost uniformly horrible reviews on RottenTomatoes. I decided not to pay to see a movie that was panned so badly. But after it came out on DVD, I finally succumbed to curiosity and checked it out of the library. I must say it's not as bad as I expected.<br /><br />Appealing to my space geekiness, \\"Apollo 18\\" features very realistic spaceflight hardware. The Apollo Service and Lunar Modules, the Lunar Roving Vehicle and the astronauts' spacesuits are very accurate, detailed and well-done. We rarely see the spacecraft exteriors, but the interior sets are great. While many viewers may not know it, the Soviet LK lander that plays a major role in \\"Apollo 18\\" represented real hardware. Despite denying it was in a race with the U.S., the Soviet Union tried feverishly to develop its huge, ill-fated N1 rocket specifically to launch manned spacecraft to the moon. The LK was the equivalent of the Apollo LM, and would have taken a cosmonaut down to the surface and back. \\"Apollo 18\\" depicts the LK very accurately. The scenes of it on the lunar surface convey a chilling sense of \\"what might have been.\\"<br /><br />The physical and digital lunar surface sets in \\"Apollo 18\\" are also striking. It's a far more rugged and rocky area than the actual Apollo landing sites, but the rationalization is that the Apollo 18 LM landed near the moon's heavily cratered South Pole. The combination of starkly beautiful gray-and-black landscapes and dramatic low-angle sunlight provides fantastic-looking, evocative images of the lunar surface. In short, the photography, lighting and visual effects in \\"Apollo 18\\" are superb, and they integrate perfectly with the occasional genuine NASA footage.<br /><br />But there are many problems with the film. As one who never saw \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" or \\"Paranormal Activity\\" (although I will cop to seeing \\"Cloverfield\\"), I think the \\"found footage\\" moviemaking concept is a gimmick that has outlived its novelty. There's no reason to use it in \\"Apollo 18.\\" The jerky hand-held camera shots, lens flares, over- and under-exposures, light leaks, color shifts and scratched film get tiresome pretty quickly. I believe the movie would have been MUCH better as a straightforward, conventionally filmed narrative. It's also way too short. Its scant 86 minutes of run time includes--I'm not making this up--more than 10 minutes of closing credits, so it's basically 76 minutes long! The plot unfolds so quickly that the viewer never really gets to know the characters, and everything seems rushed. The film should be about 30 to 45 minutes longer. The \\"monsters\\" are almost laughably lame. The filmmakers have an interesting idea for life forms that exist in the perpetual darkness of a lunar polar crater, but they never do much to develop it in detail. Also, the audio sucks, with wild variations of levels, indistinct and mumbled dialogue, interminable screaming and constant weird noises. The only way I could watch \\"Apollo 18\\" was to crank the volume down low and turn on the subtitles.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't waste time or money seeing \\"Apollo 18\\" at the theatre, but I'm equally glad I caught it on DVD. It's not a bad movie, but in my opinion it could have been much better. The story is intriguing, but the telling of it suffers from extreme brevity, distracting cinematic techniques, a dreadful soundtrack and slipshod editing in a few places (as the filmmakers admit in the audio commentary). Excellent production values and superb special effects are not enough to save it, just as the incalculable benefits of exploring another world were not enough to save the REAL Apollo 18 from the budgetary axes of shortsighted politicians.s novelty.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you're looking to kill time, you can certainly do it here. Not all games are equal in terms of fun, challenge, or points, but there's a pretty good variety.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are fairly simple.  Some are pretty hard, while others can be beaten in one try.  It is good for passing time, but can be annoying to replay games multiple times to get enough points for the next game.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I love Avril Lavigne's 3rd album The Best Damn Thing. Oh, I love the Deluxe Edition of the CD/DVD. Even though, it's the explicit version of it. The standard version is edited. It's one of the best albums of 2007 also. I own this album. I love all of her songs on this album, and including the DVD. It rocks!!!
B004EPYZSU|3.0|it's ok with names on it should have been a good movie but it just seems weak with subpar acting bad dialogue script and bad direction, Aliens arent thrilling scary or interesting just brutes that die by \\"hot shots\\" like shooting 1000 times

It's also the best album of 2011.
B0026P3G12|5.0|From the day that this CD arrived in the mail, I have played it so many times that it is a wonder that it hasn't been worn out.  It contains songs with which I am familiar, e.g., \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" \\"Cry Me a River,\\" \\"Amazing Grace,\\" as well as songs that were new to me, e.g., \\"Wild Horses,\\" and I like each and every one of them.  The songs on this CD really show off Susan Boyle's ability to \\"put over\\" a song.  This CD is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who likes this lady's voice even a little.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|The idea is so simple, but so revolutionary for me - we have the freedom to choose our attitude. You know it is true as you can practice it.
0060873027|1.0|I've read other Crichton works and this one is simply does not measure up. The writing and character development, like the main charcters, is only about an inch deep. It's written with the dialog, imagination, and creativity of a 12 year old with bits of technical jargon thrown in to provide some level of credibilty to the sadly unoriginal and unexciting story. Any writers out there? Don't allow your heirs to do this to your under-developed, half-baked manuscripts. Don't waste your money on this book!
0446573019|1.0|Remember when you were in middle school and you thought that changing every few words in an encyclopedia article meant you weren't \\"copying\\" your history report?  That's what I thought of when I read Zero Day.  I have enjoyed David Baldacci books for years, but this one was a total rip-off of Lee Child.  I'm gratified to see that I'm not the only one here to have that same conclusion.  How can David Baldacci not think that readers of this type of thriller aren't going to see that?  How can his editor and publisher think that creating a new character (and I use that term loosely) so similar to Jack Reacher isn't going to be obvious to avid readers?  The worst of it all is that Jack Reacher is a much more believable protagonist than John Puller, and \\"61 Hours\\" tells the whole \\"abandoned government facility\\" plotline way better than this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app.  Its where I turn to when I need weather info in town or to a destination I'm heading.  Cool graphics!
1449529259|4.0|I've read Chesterton before and always enjoy his work. This was another excellent piece but, as with his other writings, it is a difficult read. I will have to read it several time to get the full value of the book. Some of the difficulty may come from the unfamiliar phrases and wordings of his time period and much of it may be that I am certainly not the scholarly type. I would recommend the book, but only to those with some background in reading and studying historical and theological writing.

1421527618|5.0|Having just read this book today from start to finish, I have to say it exceeded all my expectations. Having just read 1Q84 and a third of the Hunger Games, I have to say it completely and utterly exceeded what I could have possibly hoped for.  This story starts off with an interesting premise but it actually follows through and builds on it. The main character develops and evolves. A lot of interesting, thought provoking tidbits is thrown in throughout the story. A few unexpected development occurs that spices things up. All this in a compact page turner with no fillers and mindless repetitions. Never in the book did I felt the author went with the easy route or threw in cliche just for the hell of it.  In many ways I would compare this to Starship Troopers, the novel. It is mainly character driven without a whole lot of technical jargon to trip up the reading experience. At the same time it was not completely mindless and spoon feed you with a load of unnecessary facts.  All in all I highly recommend it and I hope Hollywood doesn't completely butcher it in the adaptation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just picked this game up, been playing for over an hour can't stop playing great collection of cylinder Minni games to keep you entertained for hours

B0054JZC6E|5.0|has lots of fun games! I like how you have to unlock each one by beating others! I highly recommend it.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|I usually like art-house type and indie movies, but I could not get into this.  I was ready to give it a chance because it's gotten nominations for awards like the Golden Globes.  This is what happened.  Lots of shots of trees.  Yes, the trees are symbolic.  I learned this in junior high English.  And they're very majestic.  But I'd rather focus on the human characters and their problems.  Yes, I know the trees represent the characters, or cycle of life, but I'd still rather the people got more screen time.  There is almost no dialogue.  Unfortunately, I'm the type of moviegoer who needs at least some dialogue between characters in order to figure out what's going on, what the characters' motivations are, etc.  There's lots of whispering voice-over, but that's not quite the same thing. At the beginning, it's clear that a family member has died, and the parents are grieving.  This is sad.  I felt bad for the parents.  Then the film suddenly turns into one of those films you'd see when you visit a nature museum.  (Perhaps it would have been better in 3D.) It's beautiful, but it just went on too long.  Brad Pitt is a decent actor, who's gotten nominated for this movie, but the truth is that he doesn't do more than a) look incredibly sad, and b) whisper all his lines.  He's excellent at that, though. The young actors who play the kids do a good job, too. The toddler looks very natural stumbling around the yard, exploring. By that time, the movie starts feeling like a home video, and that's when I turned it off.
B0058GYP5W|2.0|Movie soundtracks/scores are tricky. The music itself is meant to be listened to in the film, not as an individual CD, and it doesn't always work well both ways. I think that explains the problems with the \\"Hanna\\" soundtrack. The Chemical Brothers did an amazing job with the music, which fits the mood of the movie so well and is totally what \\"makes\\" the movie. But as a standalone CD, it's just not at all as effective. The tracks don't generate the same kind of energy and excitement all on their own. Really, the only tracks I enjoyed were #4 (Devil in the Details), #7 (Quayside Synthesis), and #14 (Hanna vs. Marissa). That's not to say it isn't all great music, because it is, but I will probably never listen to this CD again because it's just not very good on its own. I will, however, absolutely love it every time I watch this movie, which will be quite often because \\"Hanna\\" rocks. :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have not had any problems with this game so far. I like the point system and its a fun way to pass time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like this app. its is challenging and fun at the same time! it is so fun!! i love it.

B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Many puzzles within the game as you solve a murder mystery .  If you like hidden object games with something extra this should be the game for you.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This item fits much better than any cover we have located at any retailer. We looked over several choices and found this cover allows more of the screen to be exposed. It allows for a comfortable feel and stands up well on its own.  If anything is lacking it would be allowing for more angles when proping the unit up. When in flight it would be nice if the screen angle could be at more of a upright angle so you can avoid glare that comes naturally with the kindle fire screen.  The strap for the protective cover as reviewed by others as looks weak and may stretch is simply not true. It holds tight and has stood up over repeated use.  This being a hard cover case is another plus for a frequent traveler having to pass through TSA. The constant placing of this item in the xray trays would most likely wear out a leather version.  Overall very pleased with this item and will buy it again if it ever wears out. Not likely but if it does I will buy another.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am very pleased with how well made this application us. ive been using Evernote for years, and find this app one of the best they have created.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I finally downloaded this game just to see what the heck it was all about, it seems everywhere I look is \\"Angry Bird\\" merchandise.  I can see why, this is a very fun game!  It is part skill, and part luck.  It has tons of levels that progressively get harder. So it is easy to get started, but hard to finish!  The graphics are amazing and it looks great on my Fire!  Each level is very short so if you don't \\"pass\\" it, you can try again, and again, and again in a very short period of time. Also, when you stop, (if you can stop), you can start right where you left off without having to redo anything you have already finished. I completely recommed this game, and it is free, the ads are so miniscule they don't interfere with game play, so what do you have to lose?

B005QUQRE2|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5<br /><br />For all those sci-fi aficionados out there, I don't want to disappoint you but be forewarned that 'Another Earth' might fail to meet your expectations. The sad fact is that the film's intriguing premise of a mirror image earth appearing in the night's sky, has little to do with the science fiction flicks you've come to enjoy but much more similar to today's indies, with all the attendant melodrama and angst-ridden character machinations.<br /><br />The 'parallel' Earth (herein referred to as Earth2) is not a parallel universe but actually a duplicate of our own Earth. All the people are the same as the people on Earth1 but can change in subtle ways, if they become aware of each other's existence (you can confirm this on Wikipedia but even they don't provide an explanation for this odd turn of events).<br /><br />The plot is rather simple: Rhoda Williams is an outgoing high school student, about ready to go off to MIT, when she has one too many drinks and gets into a car accident where a man's wife and child are killed. The man is John Burroughs who ends up in a coma for a few years, while Rhoda is shipped off to jail for vehicular manslaughter. Because she's a juvenile at the time of the offense, her record is sealed, and the media is kept in the dark as to her identity. A big problem is that Brit Marling who plays Rhoda, was around 27 when the film was made, so it's very hard to buy that she's a juvenile (someone under 16). In NY State, the criminal records of 'youthful offenders', kids between the ages of 16 and 19, are sealed, but if they're tried as adults, their identities are not necessarily kept secret from the media.<br /><br />Equally unlikely is that John has no interest in learning the identity of the youth responsible for the deaths of his wife and child. His specious explanation is that if someone was to reveal this information to him, he might not be able to control his anger and end up going berserk, perhaps attacking the offender with deadly force. Equally implausible is John's too easy acceptance of Rhoda, who poses as a trainee for a cleaning service and offers a free cleaning job when she attempts to gain entry to his home, seeking an audience with him. When was the last time someone came by and offered to clean your home for free?<br /><br />Perhaps the most implausible conceit of 'Another World', is Rhoda's decision to bed John, BEFORE confessing that she was responsible for the accident. Why would Rhoda, who already feels terrible about what happened, make things worse by deceiving John and going to bed with him? Or for that matter, how many people who committed such a crime, would attempt to form a relationship with a victim, without telling them first? In most cases, a young woman who comes from a loving family (and her parents seemed like decent folks), would have sought out some kind of counsel from her parents. The film's scenarists of course imply that the accident was so devastating to her psyche, that she withdrew to the point where she didn't want anyone's help. So it's even more unlikely that a young woman, with such a fractured psyche, would have dared to solve the problem all on her own by contacting John.<br /><br />Even more egregious than the overall implausibility of the plot are the shallow characterizations. We learn next to nothing about John, who is only seen interacting with Rhoda. Perhaps if we saw him interacting with another character or two, his personality might have seemed a tad bit more interesting. Rhoda is equally dull as she's as angst-ridden as John--yes, we understand that she can't get over the accident, but does such a character really make for good drama?<br /><br />Yes there are people out there who will find contentment in a one-note melodrama, leading up to a protagonist's redemption. Finally, Earth2 is worked into the plot. Rhoda gives up the seat on the spaceship that's she won in an internet contest, to John, so he can see his family on Earth2. Problem is that John2 might interfere with his plans to form a new life up there. A myriad of tortured explanations are provided by a bevy of internet posters, arguing that the mere sight of his wife and child on Earth2 will soothe his troubled soul. How pathetic! As for Rhoda, contentment comes to her existence when Rhoda2 appears on Earth1, thus confirming that the accident wasn't duplicated in the mirror world. Though she never met her 'twin' and has no real bond with her, the mere 'thought' that her double has avoided the fate she experienced, is enough to dispel all those dark thoughts that has paralyzed her soul.<br /><br />Kudos to Writer/Director/Cameraman Cahill for putting this whole thing together for about $80,000. Next time, however, it would be wise for Mr. Cahill to nix the shaky camera work. This could have ended up as an intriguing Twilight Zone-like episode. Unfortunately, the 'dessert' is pure indie, angst-ridden cinema, with characters as implausible as 'another earth', up in the sky.ght interfere with his plans to form a new life up there.

0312641893|5.0|When I first got this book I knew I was going to like it.  When I finished it I ended up LOVING IT!!  It was soooooo good I couldnt put it down.  It had a little bit of everything and Prince Kai is so awesome.  For me it did start a little slow but immediately picked up after a couple of chapters.  All the characters were great and the Cinder is truly a stong heroine.  The book reminded me a little of Sailor Moon, a show that I like also, but was unique in its own way.  There were parts I was smiling and swooning -Prince Kai ;) -and crying, especially at the end.  The ending had me all over the place and I felt like \\"this cannot be happening\\" but I at the same time knowing it should happen.  It tore my heat a little at how everyone reacted and the the Lunar Queen is a total psycho.  The doctor that helped Cinder is great and her sister is adorable too.  The stepmom is horrible and the other stepsister aswell.  Overall this book is amazing and everyone should read it.  Great retelling of the classic story of Cinderella with a Sailor Moon/Star Wars vibe to it! Cant wait for the next book in the series!! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great on every level.  Nothing else like it.  I love that you can download fill books and view when there isnt a network connection.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've been shooting concerts for two years now, and the only thing I've had to hold all the equipment I use has been a messenger bag. Which means I generally am stuck leaving certain lenses at home, simply because I cannot fit them all in one bag.  Not anymore. This bag holds my Sony a65 body, Sony a550 body w/ verticle grip, 70-200mm 2.8 Sony lens, 20mm 1.8 Sigma lens, 50mm 1.8 Sony lens, 28-75mm 2.8 Tamron lens, Sony 18-55mm kit lens, plus various accessories. All snugly and comfortably. I never have to worry about a lens cap popping off and chaffing up against something in my bag now. And I have every lens I need for whatever is thrown at me.  All in all, this is a PERFECT bag for someone who has tons of equipment and nowhere to keep it!

Night S i.e. one brilliant film followed by several average ones we get what has to be his next best work since the masterpiece of \\"Pulp Fiction\\".  This bluray version is also excellent coming in reference disc quality with impeccable picture and wonderful DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound quality as well.  The extra disc containing the digital copy is useless to me and although the special feature documentaries aren't anything really to shout about, the quality of the main disc alone makes this a worthy addition to your blu-ray video library.  Historical and yet far from being historically accurate, this film is very enjoyable and while not quite in the same league as \\"Pulp Fiction\\" this film still ranks highly among the more recent studio releases.<br /><br />Great Tarantino script, excellent reference quality picture and sound makes this blu ray a highly recommended addition to your video library.

0307593312|1.0|I picked this up on a recommendation and am very sorry I paid money for it. The whole story felt like it was building up to something and the ending just fell flat. The descriptions were incredibly long winded and repetitive which I am not sure if was the original writing or a by product of the translation. The mystery of the novel is ever really explained. Overall, not worth reading.
0553582038|5.0|Okay, since this is the book in the series which so many people claim dear old George R.R. jumped the shark, allow me to post EXACTLY why I think that you, dear reader, should give this book a fair reading. Nevermind the fact that, if you are reading this review, you probably have invested yourself in over 3,000 pages of this epic tale. And nevermind the fact that simply skipping this installment (as many other reviewers have suggested) would lead to a lack in continuity. This is a review for the reasons why you should read this book for its own sake.  1) To find out exactly why Cersei is the most evil woman in the land. Her backstory, revealled here, really gives you insight into her character. You may not hate her less, but her actions will seem less insane after knowing her tale.  2) Jaime becomes noble. After having spent time with Brienne and having lost his sword hand, Jaime seems to have found the humanity and nobility which had eluded him as the fiercest knight in the realm. Which brings us to . . .  3) Brienne becomes interesting. I'll admit it; Brienne is not my favourite character. In the beginning, I skipped over any chapter of hers where Jaime was not involved, but her backstory is introduced, and she actually does more in this book than simply pine for Renley and chase Sansa.  4) Littlefinger is present. Tied with Varys in 2nd place for the best one-liners (Tyrion, of course, is 1st), Littlefinger is back in all his glory. There's not much of him in this book, but the bit we do have shows just how deliciously devious he is, and exactly why all those grand lords who underestimated him have sowed their own destruction.  5) The religions of the Seven Kingdoms are exposed. This was of interest to me, particularly how the faith of the Seven seems to be undergoing a reformation. There is a Martin Luther-type of character who may upset everything Cersei and the Lannisters have worked so long to build, and it will be by her own hand.  6) No Bran!!! I hate to say this, but I haven't had much interest in Bran (and even less in his little bog friends) since the end of the first book. He is probably the POV character I like the least. I was quite happy not to see him here.  7) Jon becomes his father's son. Ruling the Wall takes a hard man, and our Jon rises to the challenge, for good and ill.  8) Sam becomes a major character. George R.R. has a magical way of storytelling in which a seemingly minor character can, in a few chapters, become one of the ones we care about the most. Sam is one of those characters. His evolution in all ways makes us root for him and his long and dangerous journey ahead.  One reason I think that many people did not like this book as much is because it is primarily political intrique and not epic battles, dragons, and magic which were found in the earlier books. However, if you give this one a chance, you'll become hooked on it just as quickly and devotedly as the others. The backstabbing and palace plottings will leave you wanting \\"to read just one more chapter.\\" Yes, it does have its slower parts (Dorne and the Iron Islands were a bit too drawn out), but overall, this is a book not to be missed, especially if you have read the other three. Keep it up, Georgie boy! \\"Dance with Dragons\\" was brought tonight, and I can't wait to read it! Martin is easily the best fantasy writer of this century, and he may well be the best of all time. Read these books!
1451627289|5.0|I´d been dissapointed lately with Stephen King´s novels. None of them seemed to live up to my memories of the Stand or The Talisman. I was a little reluctant to buy this one and actually purchased it as a gift for someone else who then loaned it to me.  It was fantastic! I read it in a short time and actually played hooky because all I wanted was to stay home and read.  If you don´t have a toddler to look after, I guarantee you´ll finish this book in under 2 days. I just couldn´t put it down.
B004TI5N38|3.0|John Puller is this author's Jack Reacher (Reacher/Puller - clever or too cute?). Pretty much the same setting as \\"The Affair\\" by Lee Child. In this version the government conspiracy is a bigger thing, but it doesn't feel as intimately personal as it does in Lee Child's better version. For people like me who enjoy this genre, it doesn't seem like a thing that would be handled by a Reacher/Puller lone wolf character. We need to suspend belief to really enjoy a novel, but there's such an obvious better way to handle this situation that it comes off as a plot hole.<br /><br />If you are choosing one or the other, choose \\"The Affair\\", by Lee Child.
0545265355|5.0|I only can say that the books are SO good, my favorite was the \\"hunger games\\", \\"catching fire\\" was a little boring at first but then it was as great as the HG.
B003L77GRO|5.0|DEXTER's fifth season is quite different than its four predecessors.  The theme seems to be about redemption and new starts.  After the tragic loss of Rita, Dexter faces a whole new world.  He's now a single parent.  Still a forensic blood specialist.  Still a serial killer.  After stumbling onto a heinous fellow serial killer (Shawn Hatosy), he rescues a future victim from her plight, sending him on a missioin of vengeance and providing him with a partner in crime.  This main plot is joined by subplots that involve Quinn's hiring of a bad cop to get info on Dexter's possible involvement in Rita's death; a blossoming romance between Deb and Quinn; Astor's rejection of Dexter; a stormy marriage for Angel and Laguerta; and a series of brutal murders unrelated to Dexter's deeds.<br />As always, DEXTER is well done with intricate plot twists.  Michael C. Hall is brilliant in handling the complexity of his character, the most intriguimg anti-hero in television history.  The cast of regulars all have their shining moments this season, especially Jennifer Carpenter and Desmond Harrington.  Julia Stiles as Lumen is fabulous--a revelation of her acting abilities.  ELI STONE's Jonny Lee Miller is also excellent as the twisted motivational speaker Jordan Chase.  Peter Weller is chilling as bad cop Liddy and Angela Bettis quite good in a small but pivotal role.<br />DEXTER continues to be a true oasis in an often derivative television menu and I look forward to Season 6's DVD release.

0811870413|5.0|I tried to make real bread for years and gave up one day demoralized and frustrated. I really thought I'd never be able bake bread like this at home. At first I blamed my lack of ability (\\"...it's voodoo, I need to sell my soul...') and then my household oven (saving my ego). When my wife brought \\"Tartine Bread\\" home I didn't read it. Didn't even want to touch another baking book, ever! \\"I can cook but I can't bake, it's that simple\\" I said. It sat on my stack of unwanted cook books.  I was, however, captivated by the photo of the loaf on the cover. I picked it up one night after the cover caught my eye, for the hundredth time, thinking that Edward Weston would have wanted to photograph this strange looking bread. I submitted to my curiosity and tried the method. It worked the first time! I'll admit, along the way, I thought I was wasting my time thinking the resulting loaf will be no better than my others. When I pulled the cover off of the dutch oven I could not believe it! After it cooled I picked it up (I had to force myself to put it down) and squeezed it and heard \\"the symphony of crackle\\" and then I ripped it open and couldn't beleive the silky, buttery, crumb! Beautiful! My first loaf was by far the best bread I've eaten in a long time (maybe ever). Tartine style bread is, however, my ideal bread so I'm heavily biased.  We have four kids and a large family and having bread like this redily on hand is a really blessing. The country bread is the perfect complement to all of my breakfasts, pressed sandwiches, soups, roasts, and salads. I'd strongly disagree that this book is for advanced bakers; all my kids are learning how to make a starter and make this bread (with me handling the oven). Growing up, in the Chicago area and then Milwaukee, I had quality bakeries within walking distance from my flat. New York, the same. I could predictably find good bread and coffee. Fresh roasted beans, like that morning fresh, and fresh baked bread with good keeping qualities. Then I moved to south Texas. Austin has a wonderful baker, but try to get it her bread in a reasonable amount of time on a regular basis. Most \\"artisan\\" breads at the markets around here are just not good or fresh, to me anyway. Thankfully, I never have to pay $5.00 for overly sour bread with a rubber crust and poor crumb! Or a sponge in a plastic bag. I'm still amazed and the simplicity of the method; just 3 ingredents and a $30.00 Dutch oven!

0374275637|1.0|This book is a must read for all decision makers.  It is clear that this book will influence the decision makers in many future generations.  If you want to be on the cutting edge of those effective decision and policy makers this is a must read book.  This book deals with the cutting edge of research on how fast thinking (largely intuitive) and analysis (slow thinking) interact.  Intuition is automatic and instinctive; therefore much of it is hard wired. It can somewhat be controlled by the analysis (slow thinking) but the analysis side will draw from it often.  While the book mainly is concerned with how these systems can lead us into faulty thinking, it also has a sub-plot on how to make your side of the story more persuasive.  These systems rely on each other much more than was previously, often at the wrong time or too much weight from one or the other.  Sometimes this is automatic, such as fear, other times there is simply \\"lazy\\" thinking,  one system imput is given too much weight because it is easier or has become a habit.  The author while a Nobel winner, he is generally easy to read.  He knows how to convey his message well. It is full of memorable stories and tales. He makes good use of his research drawing you into his world by using your intuition and analysis.  The one drawback I have is that he argues too strongly and generalizes too much without explaining the exceptions to the rules.  For instance he implies strongly that much of the skill we pay so highly for is simply \\"luck\\".  He uses \\"regression to the mean\\" and \\"correlation\\" statistics to \\"prove\\" that after a great year, the next year is not usually so great.  After a great year, clearly some of this is due to \\"luck\\".  For a baseball player, CEO, stock picker and scientist (including himself), they will often have a great year followed by a much more \\"average\\" performance.  Hence the correlation of results between years is near zero.  This however does not \\"prove\\" that there is not skill involved as he implies.  Rather the correct statistical test is the student \\"t\\" test: that is, is the \\"average\\" of all years statistically different from zero or others average.  A higher  average often is statistically significant.  Some of these may be due to chance variances, random lucky guys, but enough of these exceptions disprove that it simply \\"luck\\"  Further, often the \\"averages\\" are already from an elite pool, such as the professional ball players, CEO's or scientist.  These people have skills that often exceed the average person.  Daniel Kahneman's insistence that \\"luck\\" is proven by correlation implies that bonuses should not be paid and such high salaries are not deserved: he is twisting the statistical analysis to fit his story.  To be the greatest in a highly competitive world will most likely involve some \\"luck\\".  But we would still want to pay those most capable of taking advantage of that \\"luck\\" highly.  It would seem that much of his arguments are built on anti-elitism rather than statistical significance.  It was appalling to me that a Noble prize winner would not mention the  \\"correct\\" statistical test that directly applies to skill versus luck argument.  The \\"correlation\\" argument does make a good case that our intuitive analysis of one year to the next is often faulty...Most people for instance would say a player that had his career high batting average next years expected average would intuitively be the same or higher. .. but correlation proves that is not the case. It does not however prove that he is not above average player and did not earn his bonus and high salary.  The author proves that jumping on the bandwagon will most likely be disappointing, but does not seem to understand that skill and talent are worth paying and some elistism will give a better chance at finding talent.  That is the hope of great pay for past results, will give a better chance of getting those results sometimes.  It is not just for future expectations.  Eliticsim canbe a very strong motivator, even if it sometimes results in merely rewarding a highly luck guy.

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|This is the best of the recent robot movies. Far, far better than the TRANSORMER films.  And it's hands down the best underdog robot movie ever.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is Charlie Kenton, a boxer past his prime who lost a shot at the title when the fad for bigger, badder, robot fighters took over the ring.  Now, reduced to a backwater promoter pasting busted bot parts into fighting machines for low-end fights, he must reluctantly deal up with his estranged son (Dakota Goyo) and try building a champion robot.<br /><br />Wonderful effects and beautiful cinematography underscore the intense action of this sometimes poignant but satisfying story of redemption in and out of the ring.  Not smarmy or overly sentimental.  It worked for me and my family.

055358894X|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch is a fantasy fiction novel about rogues and thieves in the city of Camorr. Locke Lamora is an orphan boy who finds himself in the hands of a thiefmaker who decides even in his world of troublemakers Locke is too troublesome and sells him to Chains, a priest of one of the temples in Camorr. Chains is actually a conman who takes in promising children and teaches them his trade.   The chapters change between Locke as a child learning how to con people and Locke as an adult running a gang of thieves known as the Gentlemen Bastards. The book is fast paced and switches perspectives throughout. This can be a little annoying when a major heist is being pulled in the present and the perspective is changed at a pivotal point.  I'm a sucker for heist stories and Locke Lamora and his Gentlemen Bastards pull off some of the most intricate and audacious jobs imaginable. The reader is let in on the central heist as it is being executed and the cleverness of the deception is shocking. Then one of the villains traps Locke in his own heist surpassing the original deception.  The strengths of this novel lie in the complex plot and fully realized world. Some reviewers have pointed out a lack of character development but for me this didn't detract from the story at all. The world and the plot took center stage. There weren't many fantasy elements in the story and magic was presented without much explanation. Possibly because it would have been a distraction from the plot. This is a complete novel on its own that doesn't require a sequel though there is one.   I would recommend this book to those who like the modern take on fantasy and a fast-paced read.

B002QKZLZ6|3.0|This is a decent solution for what to do with this monster of a headset. With smaller BTHS's you can easily slip them into a shirt pocket, but the pro series is too big for that. Don't get me wrong - LOVE the quality of the headset, but it's BIG!<br /><br />This holster is well constructed and seems pretty sturdy, I've been giving it the standard abuse for over a month now - clipping it to my belt and then sitting on it in the car for hours at a time, etc... and it's held up well.<br /><br />Maybe my only issue is only MY issue, but since you have to fold the headset to use the holster, I frequently don't get it unfolded correctly in time to answer an incoming call. Mostly I turn the unit off and leave it in the holster except for outgoing calls.<br /><br />I admit that part of the problem is that my HTC Windows 7 \\"Smart\\" phone is not smart enough to tell whether I am using the phone to answer a call or my headset. It defaults to the headset if connected. Previous phones have gone to the headset if I answer using the headset, and the phone if I push the button on the phone - Ya hear that Mr. Gates?...<br /><br />But I digress. Nice construction, quality materials, a sturdy and tight belt clip, all awesome. Now if only I could master the spatial relationships needed to open the darn headset!
0553381695|2.0|I don't want to give away any spoilers out of respect to tnose who will still buy this book.  Accordingly, i will be brief.  My problem with these two books is that there are few likable characters.  The few that are charidmatic or heroic are killed and you and up reading hundreds and hundreds of pages about characters that you simply dont like.  Eventually, despite the undeniably remarkable imagination of the author in creating this universe, it all feels like a waste of time.

B004GUSG4M|1.0|Let me just start out by saying I have never written a book review before. But this book was so stinkin' bad that I had to.  First off, it was completely unrealistic. The basic plot sounds interesting and exciting but that's all that is going for this book. SPOILER************* The idea that the a total stranger was able to check her out of mental institution was pretty stupid. As is the fact that she wakes up every morning forgetting everything about her life. Plus, I agree with what everyone is saying about her \\"journal\\" being more like a novel than....I don't know...an actual journal?  Secondly, the writing was SO bland and flat I skipped 1/3 of the book. The characters were so uninteresting that I didn't care who lived or died at the end. The doctor was always looking uncomfortable or pausing when Chrissy asks a question, smacking the readers in the face saying I AM LYING ABOUT THIS!!!!!!! Her \\"husband\\" does the same thing. During this whole time, her son never bothers to visit her or even contact her, which is also stupid. Let me sum it up for you: throughout the book, all the characters are either pausing (because they are lying), forcing happiness, or mindlessly repeated memories to Chrissy. Totally forgettable.  I'm sorry, but this book was just a waste of time. I really wanted to like it. The plot had promise but I really did not like it at all.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|This one was a little oversold, but historically accurate and worth the watch for entertainment or extra US history assignment.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Movie: 1.5 stars; Meryl Streep performance: 5 stars<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" (105 min.) could've/should've been the definitive bio-pic of Margaret Thatcher, Britain's Prime Minister between 1979 and 1991. Instead what we have here is a terrible mess with some great acting. Where to begin? For one, far too much of the movie is devoted to the latter-day's frail Thatcher, in which she believes her husband Dennis is somehow still alive and she cannot get in her mind that her son Mark now lives in South Africa. Why screenwriter Abi Morgan felt compelled to go into this direction, I simply cannot understand. As to the true historical parts of the movie, they are way too fragmented and, crucially, fail to set the proper context so that the viewers can truly grasp their proper historical importance. It felt like watching a reel of highlights, instead of watching a bio-pic of Thatcher's political career. Most damagingly, the plot simply skips on providing insights how certainly key moments came about. As just an example, at a certain point Thatcher decides that she's going to throw her name in the ring to become the next Tories party leader, while all the while we are reminded that it would be highly unlikely for her to succeed. Next thing we watch are the 1979 election results and Thatcher is now PM. Whoa!?! What happened in the party leader challenge? How did Thatcher pull that off? We are left guessing.<br /><br />Against this background it is truly sad to see the grandiose performance give by Meryl Streep go completely to waste. I don't know that Streep has given a better performance than this one, and surely she will win her third Best Actress Oscar for this. Can you imagine what a stellar movie this could've been had the screenplay made more sense? Instead we are left with this beautifull mess. What a missed opportunity. As a complete aside, I saw 2 movies this weekend and they were both written by Abi Morgan--the other movie being \\"Shame\\" of course. What are the chances?

B006MW3VC4|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.<br /><br />Change is a major theme this season - the Great War has wrought many changes to the residents of Downton Abbey. The Granthams, i.e. the Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville); his wife, the American heiress, Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern); their three adult daughters, beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay); and of course, The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.<br />The usually robust and confident Earl (I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Mary is melancholic over her failed romance, Edith wants to master driving so that she can take over in case the family's chauffeur is called up to fight, and lovely Lady Sybil goes off to nursing school.<br /><br />The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.<br /><br />There is good balance between scenes at the warfront and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. There is a short, 10-minute segment prior to episode 1 which shows the setting for Downton Abbey, i.e. Highclere Castle in Hampshire, and includes interviews with the present owner as well as the director, producer, and cast members of the show.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is super addicting because of three reasons. The first being that the games are mostly fun and that they are really addicting. The second that there is a sense of a challenge that the User must complete to win the game. And third that the User must buy the next games by getting addicted to the games before.
B00003CX8U|5.0|All that booze.  All that love.  All that Alka-Seltzer.  All that ego.  All that adultery. All that \\"speed.\\". All that nicotine.  All that angina.  All that Visine.  All that perfectionism.  All that sweat.  All that death-worship.  All that lying.  All that workaholic compulsion.  All that fear of being merely \\"ordnary\\" and not special.<br /><br />In All That Jazz, we see Bob Fosse choreograph his own death fantasies, turning his visions of his own impending death into a lavish Hollywood spectacular.  fosse's alter ego, Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) does not merely burn the candle at both ends, he chucks the whole candle into the blast furnace of his dizzy unstoppable lifestyle.  Even a heart attack cannot slow him down, it merely accelerates him to more dizzying hights, to a faster death.  And when the Angelique of Death calls, he greets her with the crowning production of his carreer!<br /><br />They need to once again make movies this good.  All That Jazz stands the test of time, and it will still pull the emotions of you as it did in 1980.  In the end, one is torn between feeling sorry for Joe's death and cheering him on in his lavish death-throes!

1451627289|5.0|Okay, \\"Under the Dome\\" was just an aberration, then. Stephen King is back and this babyboomer is very glad. Was in 4th grade when the announcement came over the loudspeaker that the president had been shot. Was watching TV alone in the upstairs \\"TV room\\" when Oswald was shot. Spent more of my adolescence watching famous assassinations and funerals alone and wondering when the nightmare would be over. Pages 615-616. Check it out and then say the book is \\"fluff.\\" \\"Harmonic chords?\\" I'm just glad to know what to call them. \\"The past is obdurate?\\" Hell, yes. Been there, seen that, my whole life and not just on TV. Thank you, SK. Congratulations on the granddaughter and I hope she experiences little chaos and few storms during her life.
B006MQRLSA|4.0|I'm not a sports lover (yeah, yeah - I'm a girl), but I know a little bit about the business of baseball, and I really enjoyed this film.  From understanding how budgets were (are?!) traditionally managed to seeing an underdog team use their brains and savvy to get (close to) the top, it was a refreshing take on how things are in professional baseball.  With realistic humor, some tenderness (especially between Pitt and his daughter), some hard-line business (letting players go is remarkably unemotional, which is both admirable and heart-wrenching at the same time), and some interesting math/economic theory, I found this movie really grew on me.  I admit:  When it ended and I turned it off, I thought, \\"Meh.  It was okay; it held my attention; it was entertaining.\\"  But as time went by, I found myself thinking about all of the components more and more, and they really added up to more than the sum of their parts.  It grew on me - and I even watched it a second time to see what I'd missed the first time through.  Stellar performances by Pitt and Hill; Seymour Hoffman was a little under-utilized - I would have liked to see a little more from his character's perspective (but admittedly, that wasn't what the movie was about).  Recommended.
0545265355|5.0|I Read the books and fell in Love with Peeta right away! The story is as compelling as it is Brutal! it catces you attention from the start and is hard to put down!The writer did well by the reader creating a teen girl who not only has a heart but can kick serious Ass and who can be a source of inspiration to all who read this book!!! I highly recommend the trilogy to all and am looking foward to this story coming to a theatre near you!
145551389X|2.0|It is ok, alot of the pictures are tasteless, but if you are a Gaga fan I guess you would like. The photography chosen for the book was not the quality you would expect and the selection of photos were totally not up to par.......

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this to protect my kindle fire. I looks exactly as it does online. The inside straps are tightly stretched over  the kindle to keeping it very secure! Looks just like a vintage book on my side table. Only negative I see is it doesn't have a strap to hold it all the way closed. Still give it five stars; looks nice , tight fit, protects my kindle... that's what I was looking for.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I found this album by chance, looking at the recommended albums on Amazon while browsing a CD I really like (I believe it was the Broken Bells album). Anyway, I took  the plunge and WOW, what a pleasant surprise. Put on your headphones and get lost in the ambient sounds and soothing vocals of this male and female duo. The tunes are so melodic and relaxing, a perfect chill CD. I can kind of relate the style to some Broken Social Scene songs, such as Lovers spit. Definitively worth a listen, you will not be disappointing!!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I like this app so much that I upgraded to the full version even though there is apparently little difference from the free version. The alarm settings are great, choose from sounds or music, limit your snooze settings so you never over-snooze, set for weekdays only so you are not disturbed during the weekend.  The timer has saved me also.<br /><br />Fire users need not worry.  I ran into the problem where the alarm would not turn off and it was due to my display being set to never sleep.  When I turned the screen sleep function back on to 30 minutes, the alarm worked properly again.  I have found no other problem with using this app of my Fire, and the app has been on/functioning for months now, I never turn the alarm app off.
B00479SVBU|1.0|Received as expected.  Plugged in, with Ipod attached using cord supplied.  Result: nothing.  Nothing at all.  Cute lights, assurance that a frequency was being used (verified with FM radio -- it was being transmitted on, but nothing got through).  Raised volume.  No result.  Thought about returning it.  Thought about paperwork and telephone calls. Figured it was cheaper to toss.  Done.

0143038419|1.0|Other reviewers have shrewdly pointed out the negative aspects of this book (of which there are too many). Therefore, I will not repeat them.  I will add this bit of advice, however: If you are a male (who possesses a good, kind and generous soul) and wish to find out if the woman you are involved with is a good, long term prospect, buy her this book and insist that she read it. If she dislikes the book, buy her some flowers, take her out for a nice dinner and do what you must to keep her. If she adores the book, finds kinship with the author and/or claims to be enlightened by what she read, run from her!...Run away as fast as your legs will carry you and never look back!  And yes, I did (somehow) manage to read the book in its entirety. God help me.
B003XREL98|3.0|I wonder how this book was received when published in 1924 during the stirrings of Indian independence from Great Britain. Did it accurately reflect the depicted stereotypes and prejudices of both Indians and British colonialists? Or did Forster attempt to explode those stereotypes and prejudices? I saw David Lean's 1984 film (which I, in parts, confused with \\"Jewel in the Crown\\" - understandable since both starred Peggy Ashcroft and Art Malik and both take place at the Marabar Caves), and I recall the film being a subtler portrayal of Forster's characters and events. While this is a slow, talky book, emotions, speeches, and prejudices are front and center and overly magnified. The British are cold and reserved, hotheaded when it comes to England and the sanctity of their women, superior, insecure, scornful of Muslims and Hindus alike, and wearily bearing the White Man's Burden - including the well meaning school principal who does his best to go native but remains British to the core. Indians are lazy, cunning, treacherous, noble, mean, rebellious, subservient. Muslims are poetic; Hindus are superstitious. Quite frankly, I don't know what Forster was trying to achieve, reflection of reality or explosion of stereotypes. Does the book retain whatever importance it had in 1924? I don't know, but it did not engage me fully.
0060873027|4.0|Okay, let me say that I am an enormously HUGE Crichton fan, and have been since probably the early-to-mid 80's. His visionary, creative mind has given us some of the greatest technological stories of the last 2 decades, easy. Starting with Jurassic Park he began what I refer to as the Crichton Basic Formula, which is as follows: Big Corporation with an almost endless amount of money at their disposal experiments with technology they don't fully appreciate nor understand. Eventually something goes wrong and average, everyday individuals are thrust into life threatening situations. Eventually (most)things work out--after at least a few deaths--and things go back to normal, or as much as is possible. That formula was in High Gear with Jurassic Park, Timeline, Prey and now in his final novel, Micro, in part finished by Richard Preston.<br /><br />((**Minor Spoilers**))To say that you have to suspend some reality to be able to accept even a tiny portion of Micro is an understatement. But then again, you had to do that with virtually ALL of the books he's written in the last 20+ years, so I suppose that really shouldn't be too difficult to swallow, right? Well, apparently it's a rather large pill to digest based on some of the reviews here. On the one hand, I totally understand, but yet I also have to remember, if you've read Micro, you've kinda read it before when it was released with different characters and slightly different corporation as Jurassic Park (InGen), Timeline etc. I admit, the techno-babble within most of those earlier books certainly made the idea of cloning extinct creatures a lot easier to believe, but come ON, time travel?? Isn't that every bit as difficult to accept as the ability to miniaturize? In MY opinion, no. If you can--even briefly--believe time travel to be possible, why is this storyline any less plausible? I guess, to each their own, right?<br /><br />I have seen several reviews which claim that Mr. Preston clearly wrote much more than we've been told, but honestly, if that is in fact true, he has managed to copy Crichton's *Style* with absolute confidence. In my opinion, the entire novel has that Feel I used to get while reading vintage Crichton. I know not everyone feels the same way here, but Preston's influence is more of an afterthought than an outright intrusion into the style and overall feel of the book--again, in MY opinion. I liked the situations the characters found themselves in and the story as a whole, while not as believable--to an extent--as Prey or a few other of his previous novels, was just plain FUN. I found myself wanting the story to go longer if for no other reason than to fully appreciate that this is the FINAL time I'll get to have this type of feeling while reading something by one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />My advice: start reading Micro knowing all this in advance, and who knows? You just may end up enjoying it a bit more. Either way, while not necessarily a bang, the book wraps up his career with a sizeable boom. Mr. Crichton, you WILL be missed.estly, if that is in fact true, he has managed to copy Crichton's *Style* with absolute confidence.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i luv this game and the ads never bothered me free or ad free u need to get this game ads or no ads!
0439023521|5.0|I heard from friends how great the book was.  So I read the book's back cover.  Zero interest.  The trailer played prior to Breaking Dawn at the Midnight showing.  Several people in the audience cheered gleefully when they realize what the trailer is for.  So I watch, hoping for something to spark my interest.  Nothing.  But a friend asked me to read it so I could see the movie with her.  I welcomed the opportunity as I now felt I had a good reason to read it.  I started to read it Friday evening, annoyed at how far-fetched it was, and I was a little ticked at how it seemed that coal was vilified as if the book was going to be some tree-hugging, political agenda book disguised as a teenage novel.  But after the first 40 pages, I was hooked.  I took the book everywhere with me over the weekend until I finished it late Sunday morning.  It's been a long time since I've been so emotionally involved in a book.  I'm captivated and desperately wanting to run out for the second book now.  Bravo!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Program runs great and has a nice variety of options to spice things up. There's nothing like being able to check your stats and see how often you lose. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy the.game qkeeps me stimulated but I don't have to think too hard. I wish I could figure the s boring system out better. I always do random deal.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is just beautiful. Every time I have it out in public I get compliments on it. People ask, \\"what is that?\\" \\"Is it leather?\\" \\"It looks like a real 'old' book.\\" \\"It looks so special, like a special edition of some kind.\\" Then when I open it they want to have the sales pitch on the Kindle Fire. Gladly. I just love my Kindle Fire also. And since I am an author, people respect my opinion - somewhat anyway.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some controls are difficult but fun games.  easy to get bonus points, especially as ur figuring out how to play
630469654X|4.0|I have to agree with others that the musical score is out of place.  I like Alan Parsons, so I can even tolerate the misplaced type of music.  What I find odd is how LOUD the music is.  We have to keep a hand on the remote while we are watching it to turn it down when the music kicks in.  But I love the movie and always have.  I caught it in the theater by accident; I think there were only about 5 of us in the whole theater.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|There are an abundance of guides on the market promising to offer the information and guidance to truly change your life; yet few of them deliver the goods.  I'm very happy to say that this book, \\"The Four Agreements\\" is far different from the standard, washed out guide found elsewhere and instead, offers up a truly comprehensive and detailed delivery of powerful strategies to achieving true personal freedom. I can't recommend it enough, and have directed many friends and family to this book so that they, too, could benefit from the wisdom found within its pages.  I also recommend [[ASIN:B006PHDCTI The Mind-Made Prison: Overcoming Limiting Beliefs and Reaching your Goals]], a breathtaking self-discovery guide that reveals some of the more powerful methods to overcoming limitations and living a fuller, happier and healthier life.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Talk about intense......this is the kind of love that is the epitome of the good, the bad, and the ugly. This story sucked me in and I could not even un-immerse myself until I finished every last page. (two hours of sleep....I will be feeling it later today:() Okay so this story is about a girl who, along with her best friend, move away from home and her past life to start anew at college. She wants to completely reinvent herself and forget about her inner/outer demons. But, its all she wrote when she meets Travis (yummy), a bad boy with an ego. They have an extremely unhealthy relationship that grows into a love that, for them, defies time. I loved the drama, the humor, banter, and of course the bad boy that got my blood pumping. LOVE this author now and her phenomenal writing. On a side note-cheap book, why not buy it and every other one she's written? :) PICK THIS UP NOW

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|First let me say that they did not have a clue as to how large the head of the Statue of Liberty was and  second, the group constantly calling the lead actors name got annoying. That being said the movie was really good and very innovative. Many people do not like the hand held video effect a la Blair Witch but it give the movie a feeling of reality. Also, only catching \\"glimpses\\" of the creature made it all the more terrifying and realistic. the first half hour is slow but builds the story and makes the onset of the attack all the more intense. Stick with it and you won't be disappointed.
B004WRBAI8|5.0|Fringe is a drama but the characters are completely lovable and each episode has several comedic moments. This episode is no exception. When almost all the main characters go \\"under\\" to save Olivia, the rest of the episode is pure creative comedy. I love this show!

0525423281|5.0|I shall start this review with a warning... this is a gush-fest. Fan girl sighing, squeeing and high-fiving will follow... enter at your own risk.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins is my hero. Yes, Anna and the French Kiss was phenomenal - still one of my favorites. And yes, I do gush about it to random strangers at book stores and have even forced one or two of them to grab the book and rush to the nearest cashier. I can't always say its to buy the book or to call security, but whatevah. With that said, and, of course, needless to say, I was uber excited when I heard about Lola and the Boy Next Door. But even though I was convinced it would be just as wonderful as AatFK, I always have that little nagging at the back of my mind that maybe it won't be as good as the awesomeness that its predecessor was. Well, let me tell y'all, you have nothing to fear!! It was AHHHH-mazing!<br /><br />Lola was as quirky and endearing as they come. I loved everything about her. Her fathers, her wonderful sense of style (the dresses, the wigs, the stockings and shoes... le sigh), her rocker boyfriend and yes, especially, the boy next door, Cricket. Love the name *high-five, Stephanie Perkins.* Cricket was everything a girl dreams of... at least, a girl like me (when I was younger of course). He was awkward, sweet, funny, and so lovable. I loved them individually and together.<br /><br />While AatFK had more of a fairtytale feel to it, Lola's had a more \\"real\\" vibe going. These characters may sound perfect, but if anything, they are perfectly flawed. They're not perfect, they don't have all the answers, and while I did have a goofy grin on my face for the most part, there were some moments that had me at the brink of tears.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door was everything that I could have asked for in a book. I have not one single complaint (well, maybe that it ended - le sigh). Oh, and did I mention the many cameos that Anna and Etienne make... yep, they're there too (squee!). I loved it! I think you will too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Like the way this version works on throw Kindle Fire.  Can easily see face cards - no squinting required.  Great game.
B00428LIXO|2.0|I bought this because my little girl likes to bang on things.  I thought it would be fun for her to be able to make silly noises when she would pound with the hammer.  However, the hammer only makes a noise on the first pound.  To get it to make another noise you have to pound one of the other sides.  So basically after the first pound, my little one lost interest because it didn't make anymore noise for her.  I really wish I had purchased something else for her.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for christmas and we all watched it that night. It was very good, and she especially loved it since she likes Michael Jackson. I don't think there will ever be anyone who can out dance and out perform the great Michael Jackson. We loved it Lynn from Saint Louis.
B001CD6MA6|4.0|VERY COLORFUL MOVIE. If you liked speed racer cartoons as a kid, this is a great adult remake for you and your kids.  It received poor reviews in the cinema, but there is no accounting for taste. I did not watch speed racer as a kid, nor did I go to the movie theater with my husband, son and his 18yo friends, but they loved it, as does my teenage daughter and her friends.  So I bought 2, one for her to take to college and one for our home library.

0385334206|3.0|Maybe I had Vonnegut fatigue when reading this right after Slaughterhouse 5, but it was a bit of a let down and was tiresome to read at times.  It is an interesting presentation of someone going on a rampage, though.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|I absolutely love this show! My friend and I got bored at her apartment one day and she thought I would like the show because Matt Bomer is hot.... I didn't pay much attention to the show and actually ended up falling asleep during the end of it, and a few months later, I turn on USA because it was on, and I got hooked, granted that I didn't understand a thing that was going on, I still liked it. So, instead of driving 3 hours to go see her and borrow her dvds, I chose to buy the first season, and it's so worth it! Great show! But be warned of the gag reel, it does contain some mild use of foul langauge. Nothing too horrible, just what people say when they mess up. It's a must buy!
0439023521|5.0|this book was great... easy to read and a story that demands to be read at an \\"Angel and Demons/ Da Vinci Code\\" pace. Future world allows for imaginative landscapes to take readers to special places. Leaves plenty to look for in the second and third books.
B006FE83U4|5.0|I have seen this movie many times in the past, but this version of the film brings out the best in the movie and completes make your senses delight in the literary masterpiece which is this film. Not only does the story itself intrigue the viewer, but the acting is completely top rate and Gregory Peck alone is remarkable in his role (in my opinion, it was made for him). What makes this version different than the rest, it has to be a combination of the high definition that the blu-ray provides but also on top of this all of the special features that have been provided for the viewer. This movie is jam-packed with so many behind the scenes as well as interesting tidbits that you would have never known about the movie. I highly encourage you to get this version for yourself as it is definitely one to keep for all times!
0393339815|5.0|Wodehouse's brilliance is shown by not only his prose but that fact that he can keep a story going with it's following the thinnest of threads. And it's always hilarious.<br /><br />If you've not read Wodehouse. Do. Thirty minutes of reading about Jeeves and Wooster are a better tonic than any shrinks 50 minute hour.

B006TLFIAQ|5.0|After some of the reviews I've seen on this movie, I wasn't expecting much. I can now say I was very suprised. I thought the movie was well written and the acting was excellent. I suspect some of the negative reviews were for one of two reasons....one, you just don't like violence or two, you're brain just can't process a movie that has an evolving storyline. In the first case, maybe you should stick to G movies since the real world does have violence and in the second, well...maybe you should stick to G movies. Simple isn't it?

B000PAAJYW|2.0|This movie was recommended by a friend or two, and after watching, I remember why it took me so long to finally watch it...my initial reservations when it first came out were definitely not unfounded.  The film has a good basic premise and a few likeable characters (mostly John C. Reilly and Melora Walters), but it falls under its own self-worth and pretension. And there's no shortage of \\"actor\\" moments with such a big cast, as each one seems to have their personal grandiose scene.  Not to mention the ongoing Aimee Mann soundtrack, which used in a particular scene, the actors break the fourth wall and actually lip-sync along with the lyrics. This takes the viewer right out of the movie while bashing them over the head with contextual lyrical meaning.  I can respect \\"trying new things\\" in cinema but this movie did not suit my tastes. And this review barely scratches the surface, as there are plenty of other gripes, but by the time this one was finally over I was relieved to put it back in the case indefinitely.  Oh yeah and I forgot to mention, I bought the New Line 2-disc version \\"brand new\\" and there was a lot of digitized compression and distortion throughout the first half!! What gives???

Now I can run almost everywhere I go (I use to travel lots of times because of my job), creating my own routes, enjoying the landscape, focusing in my training.  This is the best thing I've ever used to run. The touch ring above the watch makes it unique. I can customize the information I want to see in each screen (like time, Cardiac Frequency, Distance, Pace, etc.).  I am only worried about the rechargeable battery. Now is OK and lasts for many days (remember to turn the GPS off when you are not training), but I still don't know if it could be replaced when the time arrives.

1400052181|5.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down; it is fascinating, thrilling, intellectually stimulating yet deeply moving as well. Thank goodness Ms. Skloot investigated and recorded the story of Henrietta Lacks; had more time passed, the information and people that assisted in this wonderful investigation into Ms. Lacks' life would have been gone, the story behind this amazing medical phenomenon, lost. It makes one wonder what other stories about interesting, important yet unsung heroes can no longer be written because of the passage of time and the death of people who knew them. I am thankful that Ms. Skloot had the interest and drive to see this investigation through, along with the Lacks family.  The book was a combination of science thriller, mystery novel, and wonderful human-interest story. There are not many times after reading a book that I've felt I've learned about something truly significant, yet I felt this way after reading The Immortal Life of Henrieta Lacks.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|I ordered this case because I wanted something that would allow the beauty of my white iPhone 4S to be seen. I'm not into thick, bulky, colored, sparkly cases that hide the phone. So this seemed to fit the bill. It did, for a while. But after having it for a couple of months now it is starting to yellow a bit, and I'm not a smoker, nor is anyone around me. That's frustrating. In addition, it does not fit into my Logitech speaker dock, which is frustrating, and the headphone port at the top isn't just right, so plugging it into my home stereo system via the phone's headphone jack is impossible without removing the case. What it does do well is protect the phone. I dropped it while on the elliptical at the gym, onto a carpet over concrete surface, and it suffered NO damage at all. So it does keep the phone safe, but it's just not as pretty as it was new, and the docking issues have me looking for a new case.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|What can I say, Tom Selleck does it again as Jesse the recovering alcoholic detective.<br />Selleck gives a very believable performance, and shows rather excellent detective skills in solving this mystery. The series of Jesse Stone are good watching, with interesting plots and some emotional side issues.[[ASIN:B000RMRV1W The Jesse Stone Film Collection (Stone Cold / Death in Paradise / Night Passage)]][[ASIN:B0024396EW Jesse Stone: Thin Ice]]
0439023491|5.0|For the first quarter of this book I wondered what in the world they were going to do with the plotline.  I will admit I did not immediately jump into this novel expecting to be wowed, because the second novel usually suffers or acts too much as a bridge.  This one surprised me and it took everything in me not to read ahead or go to wikipedia to find out what happened, because I simply had to know.  I had to know so much that I finished it all in one day once I hit the 25% mark. I do not think I will hesitate to dive in to the third.  Recommended to everyone, these novels have everything someone can want.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I'd never read the Giver until a couple years ago. Great book. Kind of a children's Gattica, or a slant on A Brave New World, except with hope instead of depression.<br /><br />Journey with the main character as he finds a magical layer of reality beyond the drugged mundane life The Government had planned for him (and the rest of society...).<br /><br />I thought the ending was a set up for a sequel... And it was. I haven't read that one yet, though.
B002KREVCO|4.0|We have always been AC/DC fans - especially of original members - Backtracks seemed a good addition to our collection - the set has some cool stuff, especially the videos with early footage - take a look at Angus and Bon rocking a prom! It's understandable that the tracks on the disc never made it to the final album - many had the start of something good but didn't quite pan out - track 7 \\"cold hearted man\\" is one exception - once Bon passed, their lyrics seemed to have \\"dumbed\\" down - that's not to say that Angus, Malcolm, Cliff and Phil don't bring it with the music though - worth adding to any AC/DC collection.

B00130VLZ4|3.0|This is well made and will give good service. This case is good protection for your camera when you don't want to be carrying around a camera bag. I think it's a bit pricey, though. My main problem with it is that you can take pictures with it hanging off of the camera, but it is rather unwieldy. If you remove it to take pictures what do you do with it?  Also you are limited in having just smaller lenses attached and have the camera fit in the case. My standard lens that came with the camera fits just fine, however. I think I'll end up attaching a looped strap to it so that I can take it off of the camera for shooting and just hang the case off of my wrist.

B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Originally, this book wasn't on my list, although Elkeles' book, Leaving Paradise, was. Perfect Chemistry was the best on-a-whim-purchase I've ever made.  I'm a total girl, which means I'm a sucker for romance.  If given the option, I'll pick romance over just about anything.  I didn't realize that this book also does exactly what I love in any book- it changes point of views.  The story was very easy to get into and it kept me interested to the point where I didn't want to put it down and I was constantly tweeting and telling my boyfriend about it.<br /><br />Brittany seems like the ever so popular rich girl, but deep down she's harboring a lot of emotions.  She hates feeling out of control and she has to be the perfect child, since her sister can't be.  Her mother has breakdowns, her dad's always at work, and she constantly feels the pressure- not only from her family, but at school as well.  On the outside, she has the ideal life.  Expensive clothes, new car, perfect boyfriend, huge house.  Sometimes the outside is the only thing people want to see.<br /><br />And then there's Alex Fuentes.  He lives on the poor side of town.  That's all people want to see, as well.  His exterior is tough and he feels that he has to be in order to protect his family- to protect them from what happened to his father 11 years ago.  When he's paired up with Brittany, the goody-goody, he and his friends make a bet that he may regret accepting.  Eventually, outside of school, Brittany and Alex begin to let their guards down and realize that they're not as different from each other as they thought.  In fact, what they thought was the feeling of hatred for each other was flipped completely upside down.<br /><br />Admittedly, the book made me cry twice (for the first time ever, I believe).  Perfect Chemistry was the type of book that made want to read it over and over again, just to get more of Alex Fuentes.  Oh, did I mention that I loved the use of Spanish in the book?  I've never been proficient in the language, but it felt great to read the words and actually know what they were talking about.  Although the next books in the series are about Alex's brothers and the women they fall in love with, I'm really looking forward to reading those, because this one definitely made it onto my list of favorites.<br /><br />Review from The Hollow Cupboards- thehollowcupboards.blogspot.comut it felt great to read the words and actually know what they were talking about.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I so wanted to like this thing.  The touch bezel is terrible - sometimes it works for me, sometimes it doesn't. It always works for my husband, go figure. Trying to set up the personal profile using just 2 buttons and swiping the bezel was so frustrating. The thing is huge too - even with the small watch band installed, I felt like it was circa 1982 and I had a huge computer strapped to my wrist. (I am a petite person).  Finally no matter what I did, I could not consistently upload anything to the website to see my run.  The first time it worked like a dream. Second run, no matter what I did the watch wouldn't connect to the computer, I downloaded the software over and over, followed the directions, logged into GarminConnect, and the thing sat there like a bump on a log. Utterly frustrating for something that should be easy. And the HRM was ungodly uncomfortable - that thing strapped on along with a sports bra was just too much. Returned, returned, returned.
159514188X|5.0|This book has managed to jump to the top of my favorites list.  Not only does it include the point of view of a boy who has lost someone special to him, it includes the girl's point of view as well.  If an author is strong enough to write from various POVs, I have an instant respect for them.  Jay Asher, here's to you.<br /><br />After having read this book, it makes me realize how much we're capable of.  By \\"we\\", I mean everyone.  We may not necessarily see what we do or don't do that make a huge impact on the lives of others.  That being said, we can easily become the Clay in this story.  Some people don't necessarily think that their words or actions can harm others, but many people know- from experience- that they do.  When I think about all the lives that have ended over something that everyone thought was minuscule, it breaks my heart.  Just 4 years ago, I was heading down the same path as Hannah.  Thankfully, I found the strength to carry on.  Unfortunately, thousands of teenagers don't have the strength or they don't have someone to show them they care.  High school is a really tough time.  It was for me and I know it is for many others.  After a while, it seemed that everything was getting worse.  It took 6 deaths, a breakup, and the loss of many friends before it even began to get better.  I promise, though, it does get better.<br /><br />The book is essentially about a snowball effect.  It can start anywhere.  At first it's nothing, but eventually it gains speed and strength until it breaks you to pieces.  This is exactly what happened to Hannah.  In the story, the thirteen reasons actually relate to different people.  The tapes are then sent to each person so they will know and finally understand the destruction they're capable of.  It's interesting because when someone passes away, many people are usually left with many unanswered questions.  At the start of this story, Clay doesn't know anything about her death.  I feel that he also believes that she didn't really have a reason to put an end to her life.  By the end, everything- even the things that had nothing to do with him- seemed to be overwhelming.  He wished that he'd never been included in these tapes.<br /><br />I will recommend this story to everyone- male or female, young or old.  You never know, the message may just save a life.<br /><br />Review from The Hollow Cupboards- thehollowcupboards.blogspot.comreason to put an end to her life.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun, definately a variety to be played. I wish the games were longer, but over all it if fun. Recommend this game. My husband and I like to take turns beating each others scores.
0545123275|4.0|First, I wanted to say how much I love books that contain different perspectives.  I've reviewed a few of them on the blog already.  I just can't get enough!  It didn't switch between characters every other chapter, just when it needed to, which I enjoyed.<br /><br />The story is about Grace, a teenage girl that doesn't give up on anything she believes in with all her heart.  Her backyard is surrounded by woods, and ever since she was a child, there was one wolf that protected her.  When she looked into his eyes, she felt safe and she felt the need to keep him safe, too.  When she comes face to face with a boy that has the same uncommon yellow eyes, she realizes that there's much more to the disappearances around town than people seem to think.<br /><br />Sam is completely heartwarming.  The way he cares- and has cared for Grace for years- just makes you shiver with anticipation.  I found myself cheering them on, just because they seem like the perfect couple.  Learning about his life and the people that turned him caught my interest the most (besides the romance, of course).  I felt like it had been so long since I've read a book solely based around werewolves.<br /><br />The way they changed into the wolves was interesting, especially when reading the book around this time of year.  I live in Wisconsin, so I know how cold it can get in the winter.  I could only imagine how easily someone would change when the temperature drops below 40 degrees.  Shiver also has its heartbreaking moments, such as when Grace would listen to the wolves howls outside of her bedroom late at night, wishing she could just be with them.  Since I'm in a long distance relationship, it also made me sad when Sam turned, because I could relate to Grace so much at that moment.<br /><br />The ending couldn't have been anymore perfect.  I don't pick up paranormal romance books as often, but I know that this is a series I want to continue reading.<br /><br />Review from The Hollow Cupboards- thehollowcupboards.blogspot.com

B0069EP0Z6|5.0|I had never heard of Lana Del Rey before she appeared on SNL. I watched the performance, and I felt the critics were a tad too harsh. Don't listen to them.  I liked the song,Video Games.  I was curious and looked for it on Youtube.  I really like it.  I also listened to some of her other songs and can't wait for her album to come out.  If you haven't heard of her or you've only seen or heard about the SNL performance, give her a shot.  Finally something that is not pop.  She's different.  This is an edit.  I bought the album, and listened to the whole thing.  It is amazing.

0920668372|5.0|My mother read this book to me as a child and it was not until I started high school that I realized the significance.  I attended a Catholic High School and every year we had a Mother's Day mass honoring our mothers and the motherly figures in our life.  The priest that said the mass every year had just recently lost his mother before I entered high school so his homily was especially difficult for him that day.  He choose to read this book, Love You Forever, and I swear every mother in the audience as well as the priest were in tears by the end of it.  I too could not hold back the tears because of how much the book exemplifies a mother's love for her child and vice-versa.  Ever since that first Mother's Day mass after the loss of his mother, this priest has always begun the homily on this day by reading this book and each year everyone, including the priest, has reacted the same way.  No matter what anyone says, this will always be one of the greatest children's books available!

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I've been borrowing my wife's iPhone to use \\"RunKeeper\\" (a GPS training app) on my morning runs. I loved the app, and hated borrowing her phone, so got myself this watch (no way would I get the previous models that make you look like you're carrying an iPad on your wrist). The watch is thick, but the shape does a great job of hiding its bulk. It looks no bigger than my Casio G-Shock. I extensively read others' reviews, so here are my takes:  Bezel: Works fine. Like others, I keep mine on AutoScroll, Medium speed. Take only a few seconds to get to info I need, and I'd rather not fiddle w/ buttons or bezel while I run.  GPS Reception: Works fine. Never took more than 10 sec.  Screen: A bit small. I keep my data field to 2 entries each. I guess once you're used to it, you know which one is what, but after 2 wks, it still takes me a split sec to recognize what is what. The label for each field is 'tiny' and utterly unreadable while running.  Battery: No issue yet. I use it only for running, but GPS can be turned off to save juice.  Software: Again, works fine. Garmin always had confusing name for their products/websites, and no exception here. The Ant+ said to download software b/f plugging in. So I go to the website, download some software... nothing. Try downloading another software/driver... nothing. Then finally figured out it's Garmin something or other program that syncs your 405. Then you have to manually 'match' your watch w/ the software. After that, it's been working fine. The website is pretty good, comparable to the RunKeeper site. You can use Bing or Google map, and Google seems to be a bit more accurate (my run is on the road, instead of 2 ft left of it) in my area at least.  Connection: Ant+ is a pointless system, unless you have multiple devices that upload using one PC (how many of us, I wonder). I'd much prefer Nike's physical connection. Garmin advertizes \\"wireless\\" uploads, but it's not thru internet, but right next to the ANT+ stick much like the bluetooth devices (which makes you wonder why they didn't use built-in bluetooth and bypass ANT+ altogether). So when I go on the road, I need to take the ANT+ stick along w/ the watch (for Nike, you just take the watch), and I'm sure I'll lose it sooner or later.  In conclusion, the watch is FINE. It has its quirks and limitations (Garmin has long way to go to match Apple products in refinements), but as a standalone GPS training watch, it really is a fine product.  However, if you have a smartphone already, RunKeeper does everything this watch does, in much more superior way, and offers far more functionality. And it's FREE! (the app is - 2 months of phone bill would pay for this watch). Getting voice feedback while listening to your music is far better than having to glance at your watch every once in a while.  So after having tried both, I'd stick w/ this watch since you pay once, and it costs nothing more. But if you already have iPhone, you really don't need this watch (offers NOTHING more than the free app, RunKeeper).
145162445X|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00IK83DIA An Executive Summary of Lawrence Krauss's 'A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing']]<br /><br />The main argument: Our best science tells us that the universe is an ever expanding entity consisting of some 400 billion galaxies that began with a very powerful and very hot explosion from a single point precisely 13.72 billion years ago. The degree to which our best science here has advanced in the recent past is reflected by the understanding of the universe that we had just a century ago. At that time, it was thought that the universe was static and consisted of just one galaxy: our own. In the past 100 years, though, Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized how we understand space and time and the physical processes operating at the very largest of scales, while quantum mechanics has revolutionized how we understand these processes at the very smallest of scales. It is the development of these theories in particular that has provided us with our current understanding of the universe.<br /><br />However, the picture of the universe that these theories have furnished us with still leaves us with an apparent problem: What existed before the big bang?  Surely something must have existed beforehand, for if nothing existed then something (indeed everything!) came from nothing, which seems absurd. Indeed there are few things more intuitively implausible than that something can come from nothing. In the philosophical community ex nihilo, nihilo fit (from nothing, nothing comes) is appreciated to be a self evident premise, and one of only a handful of postulates that are completely indisputable.<br /><br />The apparent contradiction between the universe beginning at a finite time, and the premise that something cannot come from nothing, has often been used as an argument for the existence of an uncaused cause, or creator (most often understood as God). However, in his new book `A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing' renowned physicist and cosmologist Lawrence Krauss argues that a full understanding of the science that has yielded our current picture of the universe also allows us to see that something can indeed come from nothing. Thus, for Krauss, science can in fact do the work that it is often thought only God could manage. As Krauss puts it (borrowing a line from the physicist Steven Weinberg), science does not make it impossible to believe in God, but it does make it possible to not believe in God (p. 183).<br /><br />In introducing us to the science that allows for the possibility of something coming from nothing, Krauss takes us through the history and evolution of physics and cosmology over the past century, beginning with Albert Einstein's theory of relativity in 1916. In the course of this journey we learn about what our best science says about the basic make-up of the universe (including the existence of dark matter and dark energy), as well as what our best science tells us about how the universe (likely) began and where it is (likely) heading in the future.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|I love a good watch and I have a fair-sized collection of them, however, mine are all mechanical watches, the kind that need to be wound.  This watch appealed to me for a few reasons:<br /><br />*  It's BIG - Large watches are all the rage now and I didn't have any that were near this size.<br />*  It looks sporty - The watches in my collection are all dress watches and this one is more for the sportsman.<br />*  It's complicated - The features on a watch such as the day, date, moon phases, etc. are referred to as \\"complications.\\"  They are usually expensive when offered on a mechanical watch but are common and affordable on quartz models such as this one.<br />*  It's accurate - Although I love the aesthetics of a mechanical watch the truth is that quartz watches are usually much more accurate.<br /><br />The Invicta 1513 I Force did not disappoint.  The face is a brilliant, almost iridescent blue.  The large buttons make it easy to control the stop-watch features.  I like having date feature instead of the day (I have always thought that if you don't know what day it is you don't really need a watch.)<br /><br />Speaking of the stop watch features; this watch has separate dials for tenths of a second, seconds, and minutes.  This would really come in handy if someone was a track coach or an auto racer.  All in all a nice, practical watch at a very affordable price.

Those people were probably disappointed since, despite plenty of nudity and sexual situations, there was absolutely nothing sexy about this film. Every time Brandon (the central character and sexual addict, bravely and hauntingly portrayed by Michael Fassbender) acts out, it's an act of desperation and a way of numbing the intense pain and alienation that is written all over his face.<br /><br />\\"We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place,\\" says Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, to her brother in one of the many desperate voicemail messages she leaves him throughout the film. The film's \\"elephant in the room,\\" which is never spelled out explicitly but is obvious throughout every single scene, is that Brandon and Sissy were both sexually abused as children, probably by their parents. As adults, they are both hopelessly damaged. Brandon seeks constant, compulsive sexual gratification but is completely unable to have an authentic, genuine interaction with another human being. Sissy also acts out sexually, but, unlike Brandon, clings desperately and inappropriately to those around her, as well as self-harms (by cutting).<br /><br />It's hard to give this film a \\"grade.\\" Why? Because it's not a film that is enjoyable to watch on any level. Practically every scene is painful ... you're spending two hours watching two tortured, ruined human beings self-destructing. But at the same time, the film is beautifully shot and directed, and the two lead performances are outstanding. And the film succeeds on a basic level, by showing how childhood sexual abuse can destroy its victims.

B0042RJWTC|5.0|A dramatic series about the reign and marriages of King Henry VIII. Showtime's glorious, gorgeous \\"The Tudors\\" is the best series since \\"The Sopranos.\\" Period. Yes, there's the most graphic sex you'll find on legit TV, but there are also the epic conflicts, pageantry and plague.  The show is absolutely wonderful from the great story it's telling to the beautiful costumes. If you haven't been watching it...start catching up...it's worth it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|A really nice app and a great break from reading. I highly reccomend it for anyone who likes to play Solitaire.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The best vampire show I've ever seen. Wow, this show is totally addicting. Nice mix of drama and social/religious/political. A little different from the books which are also great. I absolutely love this show.. Right when the show ends, I can't wait for next Sunday to watch what will happen next!!! Absolutely brilliant. True Blood has a bit of everything for everybody. Very original, great choice of casting, believable storyline too , ( which I know sounds strange). All I can say is watch the show.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so much fun! but be warned if you don't like addicting games don't get it. because I am ssssoooo hooked on this game
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Before Spartacus struck down his first opponent in the arena, there were many gladiators who passed though the gates onto the sand.'Spartacus: Gods of the Arena' tells the story of the original Champion of the House of Batiatus: Gannicus in a more ruthless time before Spartacus' arrival where honor was just finding its way into the arena. I highly recommend this series for anyone that likes drama and great fight scenes.
B0063GORYU|4.0|took me a little while to get the hang of.this.one, but now.i.m hooked! love to try to get as far as possible without.ever touching the cards in the extra pile.
B0055S348W|4.0|I wish it had a few more options for the Lexmarks in its database because it couldn't find my printer when searching for it and I had to sorta do a round about install where my laptop, the main computer in the house, has to be open &amp; on when I want to print through this now. Not a huge deal because it still prints but with a wireless printer it would be nice to not have to do that. Still....pretty nifty app!
B0063IH60K|5.0|good way to pass time.Just as expected. Love it. This game is so addicting. It is even better because it was free!!

B000JMLFLW|5.0|Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture.

0375842209|5.0|There is so much I could say about this book, but I don't think my words could do it justice. I admit that early on I found the book kind of slow moving and couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about, but it wasn't long before I was drawn into the story and couldn't stop reading. I loved the characters; from Liesel to Rudy to Hans to Max to Rosa. They were so well drawn and added color and life to what was such a dark, gray story. I loved the writing and the fact that Zusak had words play such a strong part in the book. I loved that the story was narrated by Death. Death has to be the most original, interesting narrator I've ever had the privilege of reading. The other thing I loved about this story is that it is told from the German standpoint. Most of the books that I've read that are set in Nazi Germany are told from the Jewish point of view. This book allows us a look at the other side and helps us to realize that there were some German people sympathetic and willing to risk their lives to help or save the Jewish people. This is a book I will remember for a long time and I certainly to plan on passing my copy along to someone interested in reading it. This is a book that needs to be recommended and shared.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|Listening to the songs and lyrics of Diana Krall always takes me to a better place; regardless on how stressful the day has been.  This DVD has some classic Diana songs and a few more not so well known songs.  Diana makes each song her own. Song's \\"You Got Me Under Your Skin\\" and \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" have those feet tapping and fingers snapping.  Worth the money.  For me personally, I prefer Diana's \\"The Look of Love\\" DVD which I regularly offer as birthday or holiday gifts - you just can't go wrong with Diana Krall.  I hope to one day see her live!

B005KELS6Q|1.0|My biggest issue with this Kindle Fire case is that either the material or the tight fit of the case itself causes the Kindle Fire to turn on out of \\"rest\\" mode and when I would take my Kindle out of the case, it would be almost dead.  I have since purchased another case that works perfectly and was about $5 less.  I regret purchasing this case.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|If you are a fan of animated films, or a fan of action films, or just a fan of film in general, you owe it to yourself to see Redline in high-definition.  So many animated shows today are computer generated, but Redline is fully hand-drawn. The story is great, even though you most likely be paying attention to it during your first watch because the visuals are so stunning. The colors are amazing, the art is gritty yet fluid, and the characters are just plain fun.  The worst part about the movie, is thinking that there most likely won't be another one quite of this magnitude just because hand-drawn animation is so expensive and everyone wants to use computers for everything.  Whether you like American comics, or Japanese comics, or no comics at all, I honestly believe Redline can be enjoyed by anyone and is certainly one of the best films ever made.
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|Works great, until you try to download and it tells you to upgrade to the pro version, for which there is none on the Kindle Fire.  Good job.
1463514581|5.0|This was a wonderful mystery that kept me turning the pages way into the night.  The heroine was embarking on a new phase of life and I laughed aloud a few times as she tackled mundane tasks like buying sexy underwear--a first for her.  I was hooked from the beginning and kept rooting for her even when she hit roadblocks to doing all the tasks on her Wish List--28 and just enough room for a small one for #29.  The hero was sexy and caring and constantly kept her on her toes.  The ending was unexpected and very well done.  I highly recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app. fun and challenging. would recommend to friends and family! ! x ! ,x ! ! ! !
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really enjoying this style of games; its a shame there aren't many out there.. This game was entertaining and fun. More thought process needed than playing angry birds.

B003E6K1VK|3.0|I wanted this thing so long, and now that I have it, it really is a let down. I wanted this to use as both an amp with my iphone/Senn HD598s, but liked the fact that it was a DAC in one convienent package if I wanted to use it on my PC.  First, the good - the form factor is great. It pairs well with my iphone with the included rubber band for one convienent package. And it does a pretty good job at making the music louder. I connect with an iPhone LOD and rarely need to move higher than volume level 10-11 (out of 60).  The bad - While the sound is \\"louder\\", it isn't necessarily \\"fuller\\" as I expected from reading the reviews of this product. Also, I get absolutely TERRIBLE crackling in both the 3.5m output jacks and the input jack if a cable is moved during playback. As a portable amp/DAC, some movement will occur, so my playback often sounds bad. Cleaning the jacks hasn't helped, and I get this same sound on different input cables and phones.  The ugly - The DAC, well, it just doesn't work. I only get sound out of the right channel. Searching online indicates this is a common problem.  As a result, I give this unit a solid 3 stars. It does serve the main purpose of why I bought it - to drive my Hd598s without having to have the volume cranked way up. However, the extra bells and whistles that made me choose this amp over others just don't work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. I play it all the time and try to beat my own score. J would recommend this app to those serious solitaire players.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Horrible execution great idea. When I hit for a missile to go somewhere, it would go somewhere completely different and ruin my whole round. I couldn't get far because it wouldn't go where I told it to go. Frustrating and not worth 99 cents. I'm even part of the technology era, I'm a kid.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a very nice app...  has a great variety of games.... the reason I gave it a 4 stars is because the games that you have to unlock needs so many points.... but overall ..... its pretty nice for a road trip or some one that is bored... :-)
B0010T56J0|5.0|So uplifting! Wonderful to see someone defy the odds. And wonderful to see the good side of human nature as well as the bad.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I'm not going to lie. I always check the Tomatometer before checking out a movie. 93% I thought, how could I go wrong by seeing this. Yup, the critics scored again. There's nothing I can say that  hundreds of other people haven't. Obviously if you have the attention span of a 5 year old and you can't appreciate style then this isn't for you. Another aspect to mention is the music. I personally think it fits perfectly. It's something I can't explain. It's more of a feeling that can't be expressed in words. I suppose it's not without faults. I would have liked to know more about the Driver. Yes I understand that that is the point but he could have been slightly more developed. As for the blu-ray itself well anyone can go to blu-ray.com and see the video/audio scores and the bonus feature score. Apparently it only comes with an average amount of bonus features. That's a bit of a shame. Oh well I've just pre-ordered it and I can't wait. Obviously If you can't get over the exorbitant number of 1 star reviews than just rent it...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is just as fun and addictive as I remember it to be years ago. Looks great on my phone and tablet. You'll love this app.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|Redline is a pure fun adrenaline rush. Visuals are stunning and the soundtrack really compliments the excitement of what's happening on screen. Easily one of my favorite new films with great voice acting, crazy awesome visual designs and a 5.1 Dolby True HD track that demands you crank it up as loud as you can go.
1612680011|5.0|This is the first book I read by Robert Kiyosaki, and I couldn't put it down.  I love the story-telling fashion of this business/finance book.  Many business/finance books put you to sleep with dull facts & figures - not this one!  Robert was so lucky to have his Rich Dad to mentor him.  In this book, he shows the change in mindset that is so necessary to stop choosing to be poor and to choose to be rich.  I have read all of Robert's books, but this one will always be my favorite.  A must read!  -  Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire.

B002OT730K|5.0|When I was in back in Toronto in September 2011, I wanted to finally check out the El Mocambo bar. My interest was fueled by my recent passion for The Rolling Stones and the fact that the first four songs of disc two of Love You Live was recorded there as a secret club gig when the band, billed as The Cockroaches, \\"opened\\" for local band April Wine (who recorded the night for their own live show, which I've also ordered and reviewed here). I never made it to the El Mo (just as I'd never made it in all the years I lived in the metro Toronto area before moving to Asian in 1992), so I ordered Love You Live and checked it out. It is, of course, magnificent.<br /><br />The non-El Mocambo songs were recorded mainly in Paris on June 5th, 6th and 7th 1976, but there are also single songs from London, Los Angeles and Toronto (not the secret El Mocambo gig, but the big Maple Leaf Gardens gig). \\"Brown Sugar\\" is nice, \\"If You Won't Rock\\" me is nice, even if Mick's vocals are a bit yappy. The song blends into a cool \\"Get Off Of My Cloud\\", which has Billy Preston singing backups. Keith sings a great version of \\"Happy\\", the band drones into the forgettably trippy, disco-era knock-off \\"Hot Stuff\\", before grinding away with \\"Star Star\\", and its infamous chorus. \\"Tumbling Dice\\" is sweet and standard. \\"Fingerprint File\\" is a funky, groovy, scratchy, honkey tonk, rambling number recorded at Maple Leaf Gardens, which is followed by a somber, stomping version of \\"You Gotta Move\\". During \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", Mick talks to the audience in French, getting them to sing along to the chorus, cool.<br /><br />\\"Mannish Boy\\" at the El Mocambo is good fun, with lots of hollering, and whooping from the audience too. Mick warns of \\"bottom-pinchers\\" from the stage as he introduces a funky, reggae-tinged \\"Crackin' Up\\". Lotta hooting and hollering from the audience after that, Mick starts to talk the audience:<br /><br />Jagger: Are you feeling good? Are you feeling loose now, a bit more relaxed? I feel like stroking everybody. Stoke me Billy. Stroke me darling! Shall we introduce the band?<br />Richards: All right then.<br />Jagger: Where's Billy. Billy's gone. Billy? Where's Billy? Billy's very open for offer. I wouldn't say he's up for grabs, but open for offers. [Percussionist] Ollie Brown is dead open. Charlie Watts is a sort of maybe. Will Wyman just wants to take photographs of girls' legs. Ronnie Woods is \\"happy\\".<br />Woods: Old bum's rush Jagger.<br />Jagger: Keith is, of course, completely straight.<br /><br />\\"Little Red Rooster\\" is lovely, grinding blues. Afterwards, someone yells out \\"c'mon, let the good times roll.\\" Jagger responds with \\"everything all right in the critics section? Everyone got a drink?\\" Then they busted into \\"Around and Around\\", a wild rockin' Chuck Berry number. I'd love to hear the whole concert, not just these four numbers - it looks like it has a pretty amazing setlist.<br /><br />Back on a big stadium stage, \\"It's Only Rock `n' Roll\\" sounds a bit ordinary, unfortunately. There's some lyric like \\"I bet you think you're the only girl around/ I bet you think you're the only woman in... Toronto.\\" What? \\"Brown Sugar\\" is good fun and real rock `n' roll. The band comes out for a nice, fun encore - \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\".ng everybody. Stoke me Billy. Stroke me darling! Shall we introduce the band?  Richards: All right then.  Jagger: Where's Billy. Billy's gone. Billy? Where's Billy? Billy's very open for offer. I wouldn't say he's up for grabs, but open for offers. [Percussionist] Ollie Brown is dead open.

6305922756|5.0|This is the rock documentary film, better than any real documentary that has ever been or ever will be. It's a bit like Withnail and I, where you're primarily watching it for opportunities to get more of that great dialogue, but the musical numbers are wonderful as well, and so are some of the sight gags. But you really just can't get over that understated (and overstated) dialogue. When the drummer spontaneously combusted onstage, \\"the authorities agreed it was best left unsolved.\\" Choked on somebody else's vomit.\\" Mime is Money. Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal have mime bits, years before either of them made their very big films of the 1980s. Derek Smalls plays a ridiculous double-necked bass guitar. Howard Hessman gets a cameo, he's probably the most famous actor (of the time) in the film. Between Mozart and Bach... Mach. Paul Shaffer plays weird local rep Artie \\"Kick My Ass\\" Fulkin. \\"Puppet show and Sp'n'al Tap\\" listed on the billboard.<br />But the music is wonderful and the boys are great at approximating an energetic classic '70s rock band's stage show, and they fill an audience with extras ready to rock out. Kobe Hall in Tokyo. Nigel playing while wearing a Yomiuri Giants t-shirt. All classic stuff.<br /><br />The extras are extensive, and there are more minutes of material than there are in the entire official film (culled from \\"dozens of hours\\" of footage filmed at the time). One of the featurettes is \\"Catching up with Marty DiBergi.\\" Marty and Sp'n'al Tap fighting. He didn't have anything to do with the 18 inch Stonehenge set, and is resentful he can't get more work as a director. \\"It's not my fault that Stanley Kubrick's last film was bad. Don't hold that against me. And I'm not as old as Stanley Kubrick.\\" The \\"Rare Outtakes\\" section includes over an hour of stuff, including more Billy Crystal mime segment stuff, together with some Dana Carvey and Bruce Kirby in some interesting scenes. The peculiar thing about the Sp'n'al Tap movie is that there's lots of rock `n' roll, but there's very little sex and drugs; the outtakes remedies some of that, and there's a scene when they get conservative Sinatra-loving (\\"Rock and roll... this is just a fad\\") limo driver Tony, played by Bruno Kirby, gets quite zoinked, to the point where he's dancing around in his undies singing Sinatra. Enter the plaster casters... except they cast buttocks. Paul Shaffer smashes an egg on his forehead. Drummer demonstrates his encyclopedic knowledge of baseball in a very funny skit about a radio show where a caller-in poses the typical redundant question (hey, I can relate - I've been there). The actors are actually good musicians - in one musical scene, Michael McKean is fretting a guitar whilere Christopher Guest is picking it - two musical hearts beating as one (it's like Lips and Robb of Anvil many years later). Great! At the Flower People press conference, when asked what they think about free love, the say it's too expensive. In the \\"Hell Hole\\" video, a skeleton arm sweeps over a doll set of the band on stage. Howard Hessman's character produced music for Smegma Records.<br /><br />In this case, I watched the film a second time with the commentary running, which is provided by the three main actors, so it's more like a Beavis and Butthead-type commentary than the usual director-discusses-his-choice-of-camera-angles type of commentary, and the guys who play Sp'n'al Tap members David St Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel and Derek Smalls remain in character throughout. Rob Reiner, the director, who plays Marty DiBergi, is not present, so the other three use the occasion to take potshots at him, and make the usual claim that he showed the band in an unglamorous light on most occasions, ha ha ha.<br /><br />More Sp'n'al Tap songs and albums: \\"Big Bottom\\", \\"Intravenus de Milo\\", \\"The Gospel According to Sp'n'al Tap\\", \\"Shark Sandwich,\\" \\"The Sun Never Sweats\\", \\"The Incredible Flight of Icarus T Bottom\\", \\"Blood To Let\\", \\"Brainhammer!\\", \\"Bent For The Rent\\", \\"(Tonight I'm Gonna) Rock You Tonight\\", \\"Rainy Day Sun\\", \\"Nice `n' Stinky\\".<br /><br />Great dialogue:<br /><br />- \\"We were called The Originals. But there was another band in the East End called The Originals, so we became the New Originals. And then when that band broke up we considered going back to being called The Originals again.\\"<br />- \\"We've got armadillos in our trousers, and they run screaming.\\"<br />- \\"There's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\\"<br />- \\"It is an endless party, we just don't get invited to it all the time.\\"<br />- \\"I could hold my own with a gorilla. I read that they can say a few words. They can talk, but they can't swear.\\"<br />- \\"Water's a drug. Water on your face in the morning is the strongest drug.\\"<br />- \\"We toured the world and elsewhere.\\"<br />- \\"You can buy or rent those gold records that you put on the wall.\\"<br />- \\"This rehearsal was filmed at two in the afternoon - who's awake.\\"<br />- \\"He could have been killed - missed opportunity.\\"<br />- \\"Her smoothness was over come by her stridency.\\"<br />- \\"It feels very fake. Well, not really fake, but false.\\"<br />- \\"They don't choose to show the enjoyment, only the dismay. The de-joyment.\\"<br />- \\"When they say the camera doesn't lie - they lie; it's the champion lie of all time.\\"<br /><br />She emailled me.<br />Are you on email?<br />Well.. my friend is.<br /><br />Elvis was dead before it was cool to be dead.<br />Do you think he knew he was dead?<br />He didn't know he was alive.<br /><br />I gave that jacket to Jeff Beck.<br />Did he like it?<br />He said `foff'.\\"Rainy Day Sun\\", \\"Nice `n' Stinky\\".  Great dialogue:  - \\"We were called The Originals. But there was another band in the East End called The Originals, so we became the New Originals. And then when that band broke up we considered going back to being called The Originals again.\\"  - \\"We've got armadillos in our trousers, and they run screaming.\\"  - \\"There's such a fine line between stupid and clever.\\"  - \\"It is an endless party, we just don't get invited to it all the time.\\"  - \\"I could hold my own with a gorilla.

The de-joyment.\\"  - \\"When they say the camera doesn't lie - they lie; it's the champion lie of all time.\\"  She emailled me.  Are you on email?  Well.. my friend is.  Elvis was dead before it was cool to be dead.  Do you think he knew he was dead?  He didn't know he was alive.  I gave that jacket to Jeff Beck.  Did he like it?  He said `foff'.

0385534639|3.0|I was less than impressed with this one.<br />Which is sad, because I had 3 different people tell me that I \\"HAD\\" to read this book! Not to mention, it was on Amazon's Top 20 Books of 2011 (or some such list), so I gave it a whirl expecting something at least somewhat profound and to be perfectly honest, I had to force myself to get through it. I kept hoping that the story would resolve itself - that there would be that \\"ah ha!\\" moment where everything would come together in the 11th-hour of the book world.... and it just didn't.<br />I found it to be what I initially thought it would be when I first saw the cover - somewhat flat, 2-dimentional and lacking force and depth. I was relieved when I was done and my night at the circus was over, and that's never a good sign.
B004478GNI|4.0|My son loves this toy, it isn't very sturdy so I imagine I'll be helping him fix it quite often.  The side wings/guns move around giving him something to play with which makes a big difference over a completely static toy.  He also has a Lego set of a bulldozer that he remade into a spaceship (at half the cost) that he plays with just as much.  However as someone who grew up on Star Wars it was tough not to get him one when he asked since it was a birthday present.  Overall I would recommend it if you want/need the brand, otherwise I would get a larger \\"plain\\" Lego set for the same money, they wind up making it into whatever they want anyway.  That's what I see myself doing unless it is a special occasion like a birthday.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Excellent quality-really enjoyable on a good quality HDTV.  Great value: three options in one package. I strongly recommend this product.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works well for the purpose it serves.  Its nice to listen to music on my kindle from my computer
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very amusing. I like how it has more than one game to play. it is very fun.
1400069181|4.0|It is easy to get caught up in the romanticism of doing something radical with our lives. Often times we graduate college and before long start longing for missionary work in a country we've never heard of. Few of us ever think about living a radical life in the suburbs or making a difference in the world by affecting the community we are currently in.  For me, this fantasizing about converting the world for Christ is only encouraged when I read the stories of people who have done amazing things in the world. In my mind they are living my dream. I often come away scheming of how I can reenact their life. However, that is not the case when I read Start Something That Matters by Blake Mycoskie. His story definitely fits the mold of going to another country and being inspired to change the world, but his book is an encouragement for making a difference where you are at. He speaks to the passions that are already driving us; the tragedies that are already breaking our hearts and gives concrete advice for how to do something about it. Blake uses stories from successful and unsuccessful ventures to show how anyone can spark a movement and make a difference. His philosophy, I think, can be summarized in a few simply concepts:  Trust People, Goodness, Integrity, Simplicity, and Do.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is inspired by a need but frustrated by not know what to do about it.
0553807919|5.0|The title really doesn't do this book justice. Although the strategies are based on advances in brain science, their biggest selling point is their solid ability to help children think and feel better. Dr. Siegel offers parents simple steps - things to say and do - that foster emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence translates into calmer, happier, healthier, more confidant and socially competent youngsters. So many parenting books focus on getting kids to behave; this one focuses on building human beings. It's an important addition to one's parenting library!<br />Sarah Chana Radcliffe, author \\"Raise Your Kids without Raising Your Voice.\\"
0425166805|4.0|Judging by all the reviews, this book has obviously polarized readers for decades. However, despite all the criticisms and detractions, few can deny the power of Daniken's provokative theories. As a critical thinker who is open-minded, but not gullible, I have to say that I really enjoyed the read, and am glad to have a copy of Chariots of the Gods on my bookshelf. Even if you discard half of what passes as evidence in this book, it is hard to deny that at least a portion of the information presented invites further questions, and merits further research. So, at the very least, I give it a positive rating because of the entertainment factor, and for the conversation-starter that it is ;)
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very good app.  I have found it to be very accurate.  I especially like the radar/ sattelite views.  It is by far the best weather app I have used!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Came way sooner than expect, I had actually forgot that I ordered it and just opened up the mail two days later and it was there.<br /><br />Mailing and packing was inexpensive and very DVD is in great condition as stated, no scratches or damage.<br /><br />All in all everything was in great order!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is so.much fun. I cant put.it down!cant wait to unlock more games and play for hours. first app I got!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I quit reading Stephen King's books several years ago.  After classic books like The Stand, Cujo, Christine, etc., the books published in 1990 and beyond just didn't seem up to par.  11/22/63 is a well researched book that you can't put down until the end.  He takes you back to the 50's and 60's in a way that brings back memories (the headlight dimmer switch in a car) and while you're being entertained, you learn some fascinating facts about Oswald and the Kennedy assassination.  Thank you Stephen King, this book goes into the list as one of your best.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have not had any problems with this app on my fire. I live in a very small town I Alabama, and it had no troubles finding my town. Also the weather is up to date with the news stations.
B000000993|5.0|10,000 days is an awful, watered down mess of an album, where its clear that Maynard just doesn't care anymore. Undertow is Tool at their peak and when they were 100% passionate about what they were doing. This album is incredible and 10,000 is terrible.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A good waste of time if you have nothing else to do.  By no means super but its worth a try.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good solitaire game for passing the time. It requires some thought but isn't next to impossible to win.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You get tons of games for free and the games are not bad except for the graphics, which are nothing speical.I don't like how ads pop up when your browsing but you can easily exit them.The game gives you free bonus points all the time which is helpful considering how the games get pricker as you go on.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|...But the only thing I would have liked to see from Mockingjay was more detail and interaction between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. The ending was vague...I would have really loved to have seen Katniss and Peetas relationship develop instead of them just being thrown together and it seemed like Gales character was written off. If Gale really wanted Katniss shouldn't he have put up more of a fight for her?  Anyways still loved the series would definitely recommend it to everyone :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app overall and would recommend downloading without hesistation. would be even better if we could download the NIV version
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very exciting!! I would recommend it a million times :)) On the kindle fire its awesome!! This was my first game app and I'm not disappointed :-)
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I tried this game set out for the Sudoku but you can't add pencil marks, change the difficulty, and the puzzles themselves are poorly designed since there are sometimes more than one right answer. I also didn't enjoy the minigames, but I guess if you're looking for mindless games it will do. 2 stars for the sheer number of games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Don't expect fancy graphics, but if you need to fill sometime waiting around these games are perfect. Make sure you are aware that you only get 10 games to.start with. But don't worry, they give you bonus points for so many things that it doesn't take long to unlock games.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is an awesome case for your kindle fire...completely closes so nothing gets in and very sleek! Easy to hold or use the feature to prop it up.
0439023491|5.0|(Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD. :))<br /><br />I didn't find anything wrong with this book at all. I was very drawn and engaged with the story the entire time. It ripped my heart out when the Quarter Quell was announced and Peeta and Katniss were forced back into the Hunger Games. The action sequence remains fresh, fast-paced and very engaging. The relationship between Peeta and Katniss has a lot of precious moments without becoming too overdone; it develops well and reasonable. This book has a lot more interesting side characters than the first book, and the arena was very intricate and creative. Suzanne Collins' writing remains fresh, creative, and very engaging. I can't stop reading!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Did not work on Pandigital Star. Oh Well, I took a chance and lost with this one. It kept saying &quot;error connecting to amazon appstore&quot; and then force closing.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Truly a fantastic book!  I don't think there was any time in this book that was boring in the least. I am so glad I purchased it.  I have gotten a couple of other books by this author and will continue reading her.  She has become one of my favorites.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is a amazing collection. For fans or not, all has to have this item.  The item arrived before the date, so, i'm very happy with this purchase.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|it is what it is.  got it on free app of the day.  simple muddled defender type game as the name implies.  works fine on EVO design
098478280X|5.0|I ordered this book after my friend recommended it to me. I should say this is a must have for all software engineers (both fresh out of college and with experience) This books has a ton of problems, with well explained solutions (not just code) The author also discusses alternate solutions, which could be a great talking point with the interviewer. I am working my way through the book and it has already made me more confident about interviewing with the big ones! Five stars for sure
B005DESVPO|5.0|I brought this cd some time ago, I read an article in the newspaper about Gary Clark, Jr. so I purchased his cd. This guy is awesome. Best blues player  in 2012!
B004I744AS|5.0|fast- low clutter. I use this when I read books or play word games and want to look up a word.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|It protects my kindle and it's light weight and not bulky. The price for the case is very reasonable. The only thing that bugs me is that the inside of the front flap attracts fuzz. The stand isn't super sturdy, but I didn't expect it to be. It will be fine as long as it is set up on a flat sturdy surface and you don't bump it. I would recommend this to anybody who's looking for a simple affordable case to protect their kindle.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The topic is VERY disturbing.  It's inherently inhuman for people to MAKE kids KILL each other for entertainment.  I read the book (well, listened to unabridged audio book actually) in its entirety, hoping for some moral-of-the-story or a message - like this is what society will become if ....  - but nothing.  It's literally a book with kids, ages 12-18, who are made to kill each other until you have a victor who has killed everyone else off.  PURE EVIL in thought.  What society has parents who's maternal (or paternal) instincts not kick in and fight for their children??  And supposedly these Hunger Games have gone on for decades!  I'm not much of a fantasy-type novels.  I don't like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter but I rate those 1000x better in substance.  I do read books with violence in it.  This is a different category - DISTURBING with no other merit.  The writer does have a talent of telling a story where you can picture details.  Which makes this book worse.  The writer can probably come up with other topics that's less evil.  Would not suggest as reading for anyone.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|Billed as a true story, yet recent findings say otherwise......I enjoyed the hell outta this book!  I was gripped from the first few pages. I'll admit, I went in believing it was a work of non-fiction. And it wasn't until later in the story that I began to wonder. But all the way through, I enjoyed the tale.  A bit dissapointed to find it was false......but when the author concedes he lost contact with those he made the trip with, ya gotta figure somethins up.  None-the-less, a great read. I remember reading Communion, by Whitley Strieber, ages ago, under the pretense of it being a \\"true story\\". Knowing it weren't, doesn't make my enjoyment of the book any less.  Looking forward to finding the movie.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you have read the book NORTH AND SOUTH, you know it is a complex story with unusual characters that has a spirit about it that might be hard to capture on film.  The book also highlights issues that could easily be too melodramatic or reductive when portrayed in a movie.  Even the character of John Thornton, the mill owner who is tough but tender, or Margaret who is compassionate but steely, are so nuanced they could easily be portrayed incorrectly.  However, this film captures the layers and nuances of characters and issues without being maudlin.  It also reflects the spirit of the book.  You felt as if the book had come alive in many instances.  Rarely do I fall for the leading man.  Clark Gable in GONE WITH THE WIND I think is the last one and have been looking for another ever since.  John Thornton in this movie is amazing.  If you like love stories, he's a character worth falling for.  But this movie is so much more than a love story as it talks about social issues: factory workers, mills and the challenges of being a mill owner.  It has a Dickensian-cast highlighting these relationships and it's not all black and white.  You LIKE the mill owner.  This is a delicious film which successfully brings a book to life and is worth watching.
1400052181|4.0|Rebecca Skloot has managed something that my chemistry teacher never could - made science interesting. I'd never heard of Henrietta Lacks but all of the great reviews made me pick up the book. I'm glad that I did. If you're normally not a non-fiction reader, don't be deterred. This was not only an informative story but a very moving one as well. Science is life and this book brings that reality home.
0452289963|5.0|I read this when Oprah chose it and I followed along with the discussions. Negative reviews of this book come from fear and letting their ego keep them enslaved in old views. I reread it often as it is a beautiful book. I recommend it to anyone. It's concepts work with any religion or no religion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a great game to pass the time. I like that you have to unlock the games and can choose which game you would like to unlock...
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This glass cutter was awesome. After a few tries, I got the cutting down with no problem. If you follow the directions almost exactly, you can get a super clean cut every time. However, instead of using water baths (fully immersing the glass into a bath of water), I just pour hot and cold water over the score lines. This seemed to give me the best cut. I definitely recommend this tool. Good luck!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|man this is awesome I love the basketball Cuz it gives a lot of points fast and its fun I also get a lot of points by winter fishing:)
B005COO1X6|1.0|Unfortunately, this has to be one of the weakest things Stephen King has ever written. Maybe I'm so disappointed because I read it immediately after reading Pet Semetary, which is a true gem, but Mile 81 really can't even compare to other stories by King.
B006INDMEE|4.0|Good movie, original plot which is becoming rare. Plus the plot is not obvious like most Hollywood movies. Good acting and intersting subject and issues. Worth renting, not worth buying or going to the movies for.
B001U887TW|5.0|Who doesn't know what Crocs are in today's world?  They were exactly what I expected.  One point of caution is that the lining means you should order big.  I wear a 9.5 and, while the size 10 is OK, I wish I'd been able to get size 11.  Lining is very warm.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Product arrived in a timely manner well packaged without any damage and was easy to assemble and operated in the expected manner.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|This movie was very funny. I enjoyed the actor and all there funny actions. Can\\"t wait till there next movie.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|This movie is horrible! And frankly I want my money back Amazon! Yes,I should of read the reviews first as I did not realize this was a christian movie. My husband and I could not even finish watching it. The acting was awful and the movie was slow. It seemed as though they put every race into their stereotypical role and the white man was there to save them. I honestly felt they threw in a black cop as not to seem racist. It was horrible, just horrible. Do not rent this movie!!
0553582038|4.0|I got into this series, like many, through the HBO TV show.  I am only a few pages from the end of 'A Feast for Crows', and it is easily my favorite book in the series. When I first went to buy the series online, I was nervous about all the negative reviews of 'A Feast for Crows' and 'A Dance with Dragons', and hesitated to start reading an epic fantasy series that might significantly decrease in quality over its course and thus lose my interest.  For me it's been the opposite - in 'A Feast for Crows', I see Martin realizing his epic vision at a pitch not yet reached in the previous installments.  Granted, I never allowed myself to become very vested in the Starks.  What really got me first hooked on this series is in GOT, when Eddard is brought into the square and made to answer for his 'treason', and you know the events that follow.  Martin is impressively impartial with his 'protagonists'.  This book brings in not only new narrators, but new groups entirely.  When it seemed as if we already had a goat rodeo going, Martin throws several more pieces into the mix to juggle, and delivers disillusionment to actors who thought their places secure.  I found 'A Feast for Crows' to contain the best writing so far in the series.  It's far from perfect... For example, the prose is very repetitive and sometimes dry, but with so much context switiching and complexity I found the constant rehashing and emphasis to be an effective device for keeping characters and plotlines straight.  The diction and dialoge seemed to improved slightly, otherwise the prose is very consistent with the previous novels.  This novel contains the greatest variance in narrators seen thus far in the series, and Martin generally does a convincing job conveying their motivations and emotions.  Some of the narrators are more grounded, others more passionate, and even untrustworthy at times.  Besides disillusionment and tragedy, a major theme throughout 'A Song of Ice and Fire' is power grabs, and the consequenes of such maneuvers or attempts at such maneuvers, and here 'A Feast for Crows' does not disappoint.  There are more pieces in motion than ever, old regents falling, new regents being made, and rapid turns in fortune.  The scale and complexity of these power struggles are what really endear me to the series, not the characters (although I appreciate the diffentiation here and find myself quite fond of many of the new characters introduced in this edition, namely the sand snakes and the Ironborn).  I cannot claim Martin has the same literary or storytelling prowess of a Tolkein, but I am so captivated by and immersed in the world Martin has created here that I have to pay him homage.  What the writing may lack in insight into human nature, it makes up for in impartial observance of the rise and fall of would-be monarchs, orchestrated with staggering complexity.  Plus, it's just so damn entertaining.  I quite find Martin's epic vision and execution of the only game, the game of thrones, most exhilirating.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|I realize now these are kind of pointless. I got excited when my daughter started noticing her feet whenever there was some kind of embellishment on the bottom of the pants she was wearing, so I figured these would really get her attention. They did. But we only used them a few times. It didn't take too long for her to figure out where her feet were and to play with them constantly without help of \\"foot finders\\". If anything, bare feet are way more interesting to her because they have toes! So I would suggest to everyone to just settle down and not waste your money on something you'll use just a few times.  As far as staying on - my daughter is HUGE (95th percentile) with the chubbiest legs and calves and although these were tight, they fit just fine. I think they would be better if they had some stretch to them, but we didn't have any problems. They'd start to slide off after awhile but it was no big deal. And this is a girl who can't wear boots because her calves are way too fat. Just don't tell her that 15 years from now :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a lot of fun but u have to b really good at it to get the fun mini games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game wish you could get more points for games though.  takes forever to get points to unlock new games.
B003Y5H5AG|2.0|I am giving this movie 2 stars just because I've had the best sleep ever while watching this movie....it was so boring, it put me right to REM sleep.
B0007VNGX0|4.0|I received the UMD movie with a cracked case, whether it was damaged in shipping or the seller did not describe that before selling it. I reccomend not purchasing UMD's for the PSP unless it has the original box case cover for it. The movie still plays even so.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its so fun. its tricky sometimes but I enjoy challenges. I say download it its free!

B0058VW36U|5.0|you get you like it I like we all like it and you know it yeah yeah yeah yeah aright yeah
0446614459|5.0|The theme of this book reminds me of the Clint Eastwood movie in which he portrayed a Secret Service agent on the detail in Dallas when JFK was assassinated.  The plot is pretty complicated which keeps it interesting.  Another good book by Baldacci.
0545403359|5.0|[[ASIN:0545403359 War Horse: (Movie Cover)]]A moving book about a boy and his horse. Although a little simple the story is set against the diificult and violent times of World War I. The story is not only about the realstionship between a young boy and his horse but the human characters are depicted with interesting detail. While certainly more interesting for someone interested in horses the book is also educational from a historical perspective. I recommend the reading of this book wholeheartedly.
0545403359|3.0|I ordered this book after seeing the movie.  I didn't realize it was written as a childrens' book, but I would still have ordered it.  It's fairly accurate to the movie, but leaves out some of the gory details and embellishsments.  It's an easy read which goes quickly.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|It protects the kindle well, and I like being able to flip the cover behind the kindle completely, but the white color is a bad choice--it got dirty immediately, and it's not easy to clean (I tried rubbing alcohol, which did not work). In another color I'd give it 4-5 stars.
B001DJ7PQ4|1.0|I want to make it clear this review in no way reflects the actual content of the show or Amazon or the seller of this product.  So I just got my season four of Doctor Who in the mail expecting it to be the same crappy packaging that seasons five and six came in. Sadly it was far worst. The packaging is sloppy an unacceptable, I'll probably have to buy DVD cases to put these in. It's these cheap think clear plastic holders that aren't even taped to the box, the ones I got the plastic is broken on all three of them that hold the six dvd's. I'm going to watch and see if any of the DVD's are damaged I may have to send this back. I've been hearing how beloved this series is by people and how great a production it is, then I see how disrespectful this packaging is when it costs this much money, it's just pathetic.  Haven't watched any of the Tennant episodes except for the specials so I have no idea if these are any good story wise, I would expect so since there's so many fan boys butt hurt because Tennant left. Should be a fun ride (should the DVD's even be playable.)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall fun! some of the games are slightly frustrating with the touch screen response time but still fun. there are several ways yo earn points to by additional games even if some of the games are hard to beat.
0061124265|4.0|I've greatly enjoyed the book. I have enjoyed all of Paulo Coelho's works. This one tells an interesting view of suicide that I haven't come across. I haven't finished the book but am excited to get to the end!
0062101897|5.0|This is packed with all of the stuff we already knew from years of watching the films unfold and a lot of stuff we didn't. I especially liked the set photos and the prop info, although those sections are a lot more pared down compared to the movie by movie accounts. It is about as large and as heavy as a rectangular patio stone and I suppose that is why the gold embossing on the spine of mine wore off where it sat on my lap and was held by my hand, which was a little disappointing but you can't expect high quality anything these days so what's the use in expecting it. The inside is done in nice thick glossy/matte paper (they print on matte and then gloss up the photos and put little glossy symbols throughout, which was a neat touch) and there are hundreds of pages to look at. It takes a long time to read this precisely because of all of these pages full of pictures, which makes you stop and look at them more than once. The only real problem I have with this book was that it was repetative in parts. However it is only mildly annoying and I suspect it has everything to do with editing, as at the end the author mentions that the book was once much much longer. I got mine with a coupon from the B and the N (code for another store), not amazon, but everyone seems to go to amazon for reviews so I figured I'd put mine here. It's a little much to ask what they do for this, if you can get it on sale that would be better. I only say this because of the general outer (cover) quality, which looks to be high until you actually have to hold and use it, and then you discover it wears off easily.  Overall it will be a nice thing to have in the future and especially for younger generations who weren't around to see the behind the scenes pictures in the magazines when they were new and exciting and who will only come to know the younger actors as older adults. This book also acts as a really good promotion for the opening of the sets to be visited at Leavensen Studios in England, when they finally open that up in a year or so, because I would rather go and see the real sets than wait in lines to go on rides I'm not so into (not a ride person) just to see the replica sets before and after. Plus I want to build and live at a Hogwarts! That's what JK should do with her millions, please, for all of us young and old Jo! This book will take you back and rekindle the fascination many of us have with the whole thing, and acts like a yearbook of ten years that many of us shared with the filmmakers and actors and serves as a record of something really unique that defines a large chunk of a lot of people's lives, both in the films and for the fans of Harry Potter in general as well.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What can I say about this show? If you like motorcycles, if you like crime, action, good story and good acting then don't miss it.  Not a family show by any means, but I love this show.  I bought all the seasons for a family member for Christmas and we ended up watching almost all of season 1 the first day.  Now keep in mind I have already seen the first season at least 3 times and I still watched and enjoyed it again.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Having just bought it I do enjoy Mahjong my wife plays one the computer so I cant get on it much so I bought this one after looking at a few. So far the graphics are great story is good nice rewards  gives.<br /> you a goal other than just advancing to next level. We'll worth the price . Great on kindle fire.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The Yahoo Mail app works great for me on my Kindle Fire.  In fact I like this email app better than the native email client!  I find this app faster and renders graphical messages better.
B005VR9328|5.0|My grandson wanted this for a Christmas present and it was so easy just going to Amazon to find it instead of going through all the stores.  Thanks.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This was a very cute game that my daughter  enjoyed very much. It is a good learning game and is worth the 99 cents!

B0055SWM08|5.0|It is what it says it is. I enjoy the puzzles. Not to hard, not to easy. The music is soothing. I normally turn the sound down on games but not this one. It runs smooth on my Kindle Fire. Great game to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice. I really like it accept its really slow whenever something is updating or something like that. and my kids LOVE it

B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|Sitting with a cool beer in one hand, a hot dog in the other, a group of friends could easily argue the semantics of modern baseball until they were blue in the face.  With constant shut-outs, players pulling multi-million dollar deals and product-placement as the new American dream; it is not hard to see the modern athlete as being less skill-oriented and more pop-culture celebrity as they step up to the plate.  Who will sell more tickets?  Who will look good with an A-list actress on his arm?  Who can ensure Gatorade will always be sold in grocery stores?  These are tough questions facing baseball today, not who is the better player? Who can hit the ball further?  Who makes runs?  This change in one of America's most endearing past times is the topic of conversation in Bennett Miller's recent film, Moneyball, and his subject of choice - Oakland A's General Manager, Billy Beane - baseball's most notorious loser.<br /><br />Beane has always been interested in sports.  Playing basketball, baseball, and football in high school, he dropped football to ensure an old injury wouldn't hurt his baseball dreams.  After declining admission into Stanford University to join with the New York Mets, Beane soon realized that he couldn't match the same skill set.  Unable to change his decision about Stanford, Beane found comfort behind the scenes as first a scout and later as General Manager of the A's.  In Moneyball, he is played with lacking simplicity by Brad Pitt.  While Pitt's performance is being romanticized as award season rolls out, one can easily see it is not his best performance.  That does not mean Moneyball is a lackluster film.  While many argue this is Pitt's Blind Side, one could easily argue that this is Miller's The Departed (the film that Scorsese finally won for).  Like Scorsese, this isn't the greatest character film - but the best directorial effort this cinematic year.  This is a movie about statistics, about how over-valued the game of baseball has become, and how large pools of dollars do not necessarily man pennants at home.  This, without someone strong behind the camera, would be either a very dull movie about numbers or just another bio-pic about a leader that fell short in the final moments.  Thankfully, with Miller's ease, this becomes a watchable film about the \\"girth\\" of baseball.  As he intermixes real moments in baseball coupled with our actors doing their part, he also races the screen with statistical numbers, computer logarithms, and as Hill says early in the film, \\"...their own Island of Misfit Toys\\".  Miller transforms this from an underdog sports film to a story about the human condition.  He lingers on scenes that show Pitt on the phone arguing contracts, he demonstrates the absurdity of draft picks by painting a table of geriatrics looking for \\"Fabio\\", the endearing close shot of Pitt's worked eyes, and lacking voice of humanity when it is time to trade someone.  Yet, despite Pitt receiving most of the praise, Miller demonstrates finesse by giving us a movie that doesn't paint baseball in the greatest light.  Miller's visual of baseball isn't pretty, and throughout this very well lit film, a trained eye can catch his jabs and insults at today's modern game.<br /><br />To appease those who have read this far, we will discuss Brad Pitt, who meanders his way through this film by tossing chairs and snapping his fingers at Jonah Hill.  His character portrayal of Beane, to those who are unaware of Beane's life, will be confusing.  What is his relationship with his daughter?  Why is Spike Jonze with his wife?  Why does he work out so much during games?  Why did his mind suddenly flip statistically when he met Hill?  All of these questions will remain unanswered as you sit through the nearly two hours of Pitt attempting to grab at anything sports related.  I will give him that he is inspiring when he speaks, but as a majority of this film he is sitting, considering possibilities, and transforming into Zen Pitt - he just becomes pointless.  Perhaps it was Sorkin's writing that failed at developing anything secure, but Beane feels bland, like it is Pitt being Pitt on a lazy Sunday.  Sorkin's writing also creates further ailments as the film progresses - mismatched messages make us ask why we think Beane's daughter is creative, only to underscore the feeling by having her lip-sync a song about her Dad being a loser?  That immediately destroyed the emotion needed at that final moment by using a mere \\"American Idol\\" throwback.  It was instances like this that fumbled horribly in this film as well and felt like the film leftovers of Sorkin's other work, the greatly overpraised The Social Network.  Michael Lewis' work needed to have a stronger writer onboard to show value in the book that literally changed the face of baseball.  Pitt's performance will not even be remembered in a year's time.  Moneyball is Bennett Miller's film.  It is not a Brad Pitt movie.  It is about the broken nature of baseball.  It demands that we re-evaluate the grassroots of statistical analysis in the game and apply it to the valuation of the modern player (not just because he has an ugly girlfriend, he will be less confident).<br /><br />Needless to say, Moneyball is not a film that will make you feel good about baseball.  It is a dirty picture (despite the gloss of the frame) about a rag-tag band of losers that remain losers by the end of the film, and Pitt tries - and fails - as our trout swimming against the current trying to find greener pastures.  Is this a movie about being a loser?  Plenty of questions are proposed and later forgotten as the film progresses, and the stand-out star becomes the statistics and Miller's direction.  Moneyball is the type of film that gets you excited for no reason, and in the end, shows a guy who believed in the technology, but didn't follow through.  This is a film about the passion of math, and how its technical applications can be used to burst a bloated game.  Baseball should fear Moneyball.s pointless.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this Bible.  I love being able to read any version I want. I also have found that the reading plan works great for me - especially the reminders.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that this app has so many versions, reading plans, and customizable options. Excellent app for first time and long time Bible readers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a great app!! i cant stop playing it. i could never get bored with it, i get to play many diffrent  games everytime i play it (: great book for young kids and adults!!! never want to play any other game every again!!!!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|In my opinion, the 20 Jan 2012, review of \\"Red Tails\\" was off-the-mark.  The review stated that the flying scenes were great, but the \\"ground story\\" within movie, was shallow - rehashing old racial inequality themes.  However, the reviewer was wrong for TWO reasons:  First, as of 22 Jan 2912, \\"Red Tails\\" is the number two in the country, with a $19 million dollar purse for the first week!  Secondly, there was an apparent miscalculation by the movie industry writ-large, that the American public has somehow lost interest and draw power in a TRUE story of Americans overcoming overwhelming odds and adversity to fight for their country and for racial equality.  Red Tails delivers outstanding performances by both A-listers Cuba Gooding Jr. and Terrence Howard as well as the up-and-coming supporting actors.  The action, tempo and effects were great.  The storylines for the characters were good as well.  The movie allows Americans the opportunity to review first-hand the bigotry and sheer ignorance of that time period, in hopes we will rise above it today.  And that perhaps by remembering racism and prejudice in the context of such magnificent sacrfice and human struggle will minimize the impact of the small pockets of poison that still lingers within our society, even today.  Red Tails is AWESOME true-story of America at its best, while simultaneously being at its worse.  Its a great movie to take young teens to, just as a reminder, although we havent quite attained \\"the dream\\", perhaps they can step closer to attainment in their generation.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app. it gives many choices on games to play. the games are fun and makes for a way to pass time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app, easy way to get the Word of God!!! A must for people on the go. I especially like the plans!!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Everything as in its original plastic wrap, brand new, as described. The blurays work perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Videos were received very fast and packaged properly. No damage and made a great Christmas gift! Would definitely purchase from them in the future.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Got this for my 15 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it.  Has mini posters is the package deal which she has framed and hung on her wall.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|like the app fun time waster don't like the ads wish there was an ad free version and the games are not that hard to unlock
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are ok. I like other games better but it does pass the time. it is free, so it is worth what I paid for it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have really enjoyed using this app to study the Word. I especially like the audio feature. I love to read along as I listen to the audio to really get the full effect of the scripture. It also helps with learning to pronounce difficult words/names when you can hear it read to you. Having a dyslexic child who struggles to read, having the Bible in audio is a priceless tool. I also enjoy the variety of reading plans offered and translations. This would have to be my most used app and it's free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok its alright. could have bbetter gammes. point system how it goes up is pretty bad too... yeah idk.  alright
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not a bad time burner. Find myself shooting for pts to unlock other games but some are not as intuitive.  Still there are so many it doesn't matter.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I love mystery games, and the concept of this game is great, but some of the clues don't make much sense.  The price is right, but for me I got really frustrated towards the end when the clue to unlock the globe is very loosely connected to the items you can view in the rooms.  It would have made much more sense to use the name of the dog.  I would buy the sequel if there is one but hope it better connects the clues.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Well what can I say??....excellent!!5 Start for this movie.A good convination to make the best movie in this time .
B004EPZ084|5.0|I love this movie, it's so damn funny.  Every single actor/actress in it does a great job.  I watch it over and over and over...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved the games. me and my friends and family play the games and I save my points to unlock new ones. rock on!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it it is so fun but yet it is so hard. if you play this you have some fun and some headaches
B0063IH60K|4.0|Totally fun and highly addictive game.  I play it on my kindle fire and my phone for hours on end.
0307959856|2.0|While I did finish reading this book I am sorry to say that I was bored throughout.  Until the very end there is vitually no communication between Elizabeth & Darcy.  Far too much narrative and far too little engagement of the charaters.  If you are looking for a mystery try the The Phantom of Pemberley. While it has a little too much flourich, it still developes the characters and has an actually plot.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Good to have all three movies in a set!  Great Christmas present for the husband!  He loved it! Have to say the last movie wasn't as exciting as the first two.
0739350463|5.0|I read this book after receiving it as a Christmas gift when I was, maybe, ten years old from a friend in Girl Scouts.  This was the book that made me a \\"reader\\"  It opened my eyes to fiction and triggered my imagination like nothing had before.  Not even close.  I've been a \\"reader\\" ever since.  I don't actually remember what about the story captured me, but something of the feeling remains fifty years later.  Recently I bought this audio CD book as a gift for someone who has difficulty reading, hoping that he will have something like the life-changing experience with this story that I had.
1423101499|5.0|This book is really excellent! It was interesting, the story line was very good. I had a lot of fun reading it. I read it in 2 days. This whole series is wonderful. I'm reading the last book now. I really wish they would make the rest of the books into movies like they did with the first one. Although the first one they kind of messed up and mixed 2 books together. I recommend this book especially for younger kids. It is a great way to get into fantasy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good quick play for short attention spans or limited amount of time to play. Good for all ages, big or little.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These are great games for adults and kids. Simple directions and fun graphics. My kids play them all the time!!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas, and it is perfect for his brand new Samsung phone. He loves it! It may seem a little pricey, but for the chic look and durability, it is worth every penny. I highly recommend this product!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun because it has a variaty of games and it is easy to get coins also because it is free
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|WOW! WHAT A MOVIE! NOT JUST ABOUT BASEBALL. I SAW THIS MOVIE A DAY AFTER, ONE OF THE MOST THRILLING NFC FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP  GAME IN RECENT MEMORY THE 2012 SF 49ers VS NY.GIANTS WHAT DRAMA!THANKS TO AMAZON (VOD)FOR ALLOWING ME TO VIEW THIS FILM.CHEAPER THAN GOING TO THE THEATER. I THOUGHT THE PERFORMANCES OF BRAD PITT,JONAH HILL and PHILLIP SEYMORE ARE WORTHY OF OSCAR NOMINATIONS.THE THEME OF THE MOVIE,I THOUGHT WAS WHEN YOU DECIDE TO CHOOSE TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IS PLAYED AND MAYBE A THREAT TO SOMEONE'S LIVELYHOOD IS ALWAYS INTERESTING.AND TO SEE WHAT BILLY BEANE (BRAD PITT) HAD TO ENDURE,AND TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO SEE HIS DREAM ALMOST FULFILLED.WHAT A TRUE STORY! IT WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL AND A JOY TO WATCH!
6305161879|5.0|This is serious comedy, that grows on you, but is well off the edge of seriousness.<br /><br />Kevin Kline, as Jamie Lee Curtis' lover, clearly relishes his role as a faux incestuous paranoid.  A diamond heist is what brings this cast of misfits together in a plot that gets zanier as it develops.<br /><br />As they each try to out fox the other, a romantic quadrangle develops that ends with an unexpected twist. That's all I can comprehend of this movie in an orderly and coherent fashion.<br /><br />I love this movie and wish I had the words to say why, but I don't. Five stars!
B001AAAE5K|4.0|I had been wanting to add this movie to my collection for a few years now.  This has a great fairy-tale type story line.  After reading some of the low-star reviews it sounds as if some people just haven't developed a stronger appreciation for original plots.  It's not a story about the Titanic, we have already seen and heard of that one.  This is an original idea that most with open and deeper understanding minds will surely appreciate.<br /><br />The minor warning that I have is something that I overlooked and could only be disappointed in myself; is that the cover and on-screen instructions for the movie is NOT in English.  Luckily, the voices are in English and with a little luck, I was able to play the movie without the subtitles at the bottom which were in another language.  Wish I would have studied the ad a little further to realize that I was buying a copy in another language other than English.  Still a great film!!
0780619587|5.0|Remember in \\"Jaws\\" where the Captain says: \\" we are going to need a bigger boat?\\" The same applies to this movie. It is very nearly too excellent to rate. One needs more than a boatload of stars to rate it. So I guess we are going to need a bigger boat tin which to place all of the stars needed to rate this movie.<br /><br />What can one say? Here we have a child prodigy growing up in a lower middle class Australian family with an over-bearing father who survived the holocaust. Auschwitz has taught him only two things, both of which he became neurotic about: that only the strong win and that winning is everything. The exact wrong lessons to earn from Hitler. These lessons manifested themselves as a \\"control neurosis\\" compelling him to control his family with an iron hand and at all cost -- that if it were his own survival imperative. It is these two well-meaning issues running in the subtext of the Helfgott family life that in the end undoes and destroys the family and the mind of the child prodigy.<br /><br />Because he comes up second best in a piano competition where he tries to play a piece much too difficult for his immature brain and skill, his father turns his anger on him and refuses to allow him to accept a scholarship to the U.S. This accumulation of defeats and rejections is too much for the youngster and from there on he chooses to make his own decisions about his career and finding his way in life,<br /><br />As a result, David Helfgott (Geoffrey Rush) is ejected from the home and the family. His mind is too fragile to survive both the shock of this excommunication, and the pain of losing a local piano competition; but most of all in not being able to earn and maintain his father's approval. In a short while, this abandonment and accumulated problems leads to him to a mental hospital.<br /><br />Eventually he picks himself up dusts himself off, moves out of the hospital, finds an old piano and rehabilitates himself through the only thing he has masteryover, practicing and playing the piano. One night, in the rain he wanders into a piano bar without a piano player and tinkers for a while before he lets loose on Rimsky- Korsakov's \\"The Flight of the Bumble Bee\\" and in the process electrifies the small audience.  This self-arranged audition gets him a job, a place to stay and a new family of friends and admirers.  As his confidence grows, he builds up to attacking his real nemesis, the piece that help send him to the mental institution: Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in \\"D\\" Minor, opus 30, menacingly referred to as \\"Rach 3.\\" With the support of his new found friends he slowly works his way back into the classical music's inner circle and gets to play \\"Rach 3\\" in a concert where he redeems himself and overcomes his father's hex. His mental health is nearly completely restored. 100 stars
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I'm probably one of the few people here who was around when this hit the theaters back in the day, and I can say that it was very controversial at the time. The fact that it is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a realistic portrayal of gang life or activities seems to go over a lot of people's heads now as it did then. While I have my issues with this version of the movie as well, I suspect part of the reason it was done this way this time around was to try to remove it one step further from reality, to portray it as a comic book/graphic novel kind of experience, which takes away the need to suspend disbelief since it's all a fantasy, or 'some alternate reality', ala \\"Streets of Fire\\". Once you view it that way, what Hill did makes perfect sense. Whether or not that was his original vision, I'm not sure, perhaps he didn't have the means at the time, or he couldn't sell the story that way, in any case, it's important to remember that directors often don't get to present something exactly as they might want. If you try to view the film as a realistic depiction of gang life, you'll be disappointed, because it's not. Gangs are rarely integrated, gangs rarely brawl in the streets, and they certainly don't run around in baseball uniforms and makeup. If you view the film as a fantasy adventure, it stands the test of time very well...and isn't that really the attraction of cult films in the first place, that they are removed from reality?
B000A2UBN4|5.0|In this \\"1991 thriller remake,\\" we get to see why Scorsese is considered one of the master filmmakers of our (or any) time. This thriller set near the North Carolina coast, centers on an \\"arms race of revenge-counter revenge\\" between ex-prisoner Max Cady (Bob De Niro) and the lawyer who sent him \\"up the river\\" Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte).<br /><br />As the movie opens Cady is returning from a 14-year stint in the \\"big  house\\" with a single purpose in mind: Getting revenge for being allowed to be wrongly convicted for rape by his lawyer Sam Bowden. Bowden, married to the sexiest woman ever in show business (Jessica Lange) and with a naïve 14-year old daughter (Juliette Lewis), realizes that he has his work cut out for him trying to protect his family from Cady. Bowden quickly exhausts all of the tricks in his legal trick bag to no avail, as Cady \\"meets\\" and \\"raises\\" him move-for-move each time Bowden tries to buy off Cady's revenge project. This leaves nothing for them both to do but to \\"get down and dirty,\\" literally going for the other's jugular -- where they fight to the death in a last scene on a boat in a raging storm where one cries \\"uncle.\\"<br /><br />It is an instructive exercise in understanding how much the art of movie making has advanced for the better, just to view the older (1962) version and this version, back to back. They do not even seem like the same movie? This version has the legendary Victor Mature appearing in a cameo role. Clearly a five star movie.
B000007RYQ|5.0|Uri Caine and his ensemble again succeed in exposing a challenging composer`s music in a more intimate light. Highly recommended for Mahler lovers.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you have not seen this yet you need to.  An eye opening experience to be had by everyone.  Get your friends together and enjoy the show.
B00000B9N3|5.0|Sometimes Wagner's music can seem intimidating. These arrangements from Uri Caine with his ensemble highlight the beauty of the music in a chamber orchestra setting.
B004SBX112|4.0|I have all three games in paid editions. The game play is good, the seasonal updates fun, though more levels would draw the fun out.
B0061S073A|5.0|I was very hopeful about this program given the numerous 5-star reviews but after trying this on my Evo 4G running ICS it has a horrible ghosting of the icons duplicated making the program almost useless and only frustrating for children.<br /><br />Update 1: Not sure what changed, but after rebooting it appears to be functioning properly.  Also the wallpaper for the app is now missing but I like the simple, plain black look much better.  My favorite feature about the program is the fact that if you choose not to enable the home button lock, and the child attempts to exit the program via the home key, the program gives a simple warning and re-enters Kids Place.<br /><br />Update 2: I've had ZERO issues with this on my Touchpad running CM9 (ICS).  Great app!  I recommend it to everyone that children and an Android device.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love when a product design is well thought out. First of all, it fits the kindle perfectly without adding any additional bulk or weight. It has a nice soft material on the inside which not only protects the screen but also is soft and comfortable on your hands when in use. The elastic strap not only keeps the cover closed when not in use but also keeps it in a open position when in use. Additionally you can snap it around your hand to help hold the device when using one hand. All in All, a PERFECT PRODUCT.
B003E88TKS|5.0|There is one surprise after another in the movie.  There are so many contemporary issues addressed here with no clear cut answers to the problems raised but plenty of food for thought.  This movie will stay with you.  You will want to take George Clooney home with you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i absolutely loved this game i stayed up all night playing it legit-!!!!!!! i think ill play it for a couple more hours oh well
0385534639|4.0|Magic abounds in this novel.  The circus is almost another character and it plays home to two young people who have been trained to take part in a very undefined form of battle.  As a performer trained by her father, Celia is taught to make her magic appear to be \\"tricks\\" when in fact she truly can transform items into birds, change the color and material of her dress, and even heal her own injuries.  Marco's teacher found him in an orphanage and his strength is taking his target to a magical fantasy world.  The book also includes others who helped build the circus and a few of its fans.  The book seems to have pretty polarized reviews with folks either loving or hating it.  In my opinion, the writing is simply stunning.  It is not a fast-paced read, not a ton \\"happens\\" for much of the book, but that's okay by me although I know it isn't a fit for everyone.  I was less-interested in the book's billing as a love story (another complaint among readers is that it doesn't really fit in that realm despite the book jacket's promises) and more in just falling into the circus.  For me, four stars and maybe even four and a half.  You need to be fully willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the magic.  You also need to be okay with more detail than plot.  I will say that there ARE a lot of characters, and many do take center stage in at least one chapter, but I had no issues keeping everyone straight.  Recommend to folks who just like beautiful writing and are fine with slower plots.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|everytime i try to open it since  update it force closes. would like a way to Uninstall the updates. if anyone has a fix please let me know
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|People seem to rank the best Pink Floyd albums as either 'The Wall' or 'Dark Side.'  While I agree that those are both great albums I think 'The Final Cut' should be rated with the best.  The album focuses on Roger Waters loss of his father and the struggles that we all have with the issues of war.  A very personal album with less rockers and more substance and haunting images.  It also is the last Floyd album with Roger Waters.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|Amusing. Interesting. Inspirational. The Parisan charm is overflowing. If You like recent Woody Allen's films you will enjoy this one.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|I was all psyched to see this in the theater. The trailers made me believe it was going to be a movie about a boy and his GT. I was hoping for lots of driving and V8's rumbling my seats. Not to give too much away, but there isn't a lot of that in this movie. One of the chase scenes felt like an \\"homage\\" to Bullitt, that was a bit of a dud for me. I left the theater thinking, \\"meh.\\" It wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />But something about that movie did stick with me. The cinematography was good, the music stands out, and there was a great chemistry between Driver and Irene. Plus, there's a major cool factor with this movie. He doesn't have to say much, he's just a bad ass.<br /><br />If you sit down to this movie with expectations of tons of car chases, you're going to be dissapointed. Watch it with an open mind and you'll want to see it again. That's why I ordered it, can't wait to watch it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like how u can customize the background and the cards. Also how you can choose a winning or random deal.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|First i have just come to opera.But I found the entire movie to be wonderful.Both in the singing from Netrebko all the way through Vilazon and Netrebko are wonderful to together in this and other pieces I have seen.The music is just brilliant.I see why I have know of La Boheme ,it's title anyway all my life.Now I know why the score is outstanding and lyrics as well.the entire production is nothing short of wonderful.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun, sure beats shuffling cards!  Nice little game to play, quick, and fun to try and beat your previous times.  Try it, you will enjoy.
0395925037|1.0|It is criminal that this book should still be under copyright. Do Hitler's heirs really need royalties? Does protecting this book \\"Promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts\\" (US Constitution, Article 1, Section 8)? $14.00 is far too much to pay for a work that should have been in the public domain fifty years ago.
0099554569|4.0|If this was a GoodReads review I would have rated it 3 stars since it was an okay book and that I liked it a little. However since I'm posting this review on Amazon and can't give half stars, I will bump the rating up to four stars... This was very generous because I hated and disliked most of the characters with the exception of Midori and Hatsumi. The rating is more for the writing and translation, which blew me away and makes me want to read more from this author.<br /><br />I was very impressed by both the translation and writing style. I've read some translations of different French and Swedish books were the English was very broken, but in this book the English was very smooth. I have to hand it to an author when they begin the story in a different time and then use a flashback sequence to tell the bulk of the novel; it's much harder that way to make sure the story doesn't contradict itself. The imaginary was very well done, and I could easily picture the settings and characters easily.<br /><br />The only things that bugged me were how some of the characters were so loathsome at times. In particular I strongly disliked Nagasawa and Reiko, and to a lesser extent I disliked Toru and Naoko. To a degree, they all were whiny, dysfunctional and needy. I think Midori and Hatsumi were the only characters I liked. However by the end of the book, I feel like those characters were well written enough to make me feel something towards each one. If I liked the characters more, this would have had a much higher rating.<br /><br />Even though this book has a lot of death and abandonment in it, it doesn't glorify it. Instead it shows the aftermath and how lonely Toru is without those people. With Toru being a virtual shut-in in his own being without many, it clearly shows how isolated he is when people around him go away. I wouldn't blame him for having the same response; I would feel almost the same way if I was him. If he didn't sleep around and use girls, I would have liked him more if he was more faithful to the one girl he liked.ed him more if he was more faithful to the one girl he liked.

B0055SWM08|2.0|I find that the music is terrible. The game itself is just a remake of a generic game. The menu is also ugly. The only thing I can say is that the Zen theme is relaxing.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|could NOT put this book down & wished it would never end!  I think everyone else said all there is to say about this excellant novel.  READ IT AND ENJOY!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a good way to pass the time. Its great to keep kids busy also. It would be a little better with more points per game.
B003LPV960|4.0|This is a great movie, though not for littler children. My kids are 3 and 5 and it was a bit much for them. I had forgotten that the father was a mortician. That was a difficult one to explain. However, how can you not like a movie with Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and Angela Lansbury? Great fun, great story, and good message. I haven't read the Nurse Matilda books, but I want to now.
