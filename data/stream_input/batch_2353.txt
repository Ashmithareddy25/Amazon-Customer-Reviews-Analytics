B007FEZQF8|4.0|The book was very entertaining, but it was way too short for seven dollars. If the rest of the series were like.this I will not be a buyer
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A modern classic that not only lives up to the hype but surpasses it as well as its TV counterpart.
B000FA675C|4.0|Challenged my intelligence, but I couldn't put it down. Thank goodness for the dictionary so I could look up some of the ancient names, terms and since I'm not fluent in French, I was able to get the drift. Plenty of twists and turns, adventure and surprises.
B000FA675C|5.0|read it when it first came out. full of suspense, I reread it periodically<br />One of these days I may watch the movie to see how it compares!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|.  It is very easy to read and operate.  I love this calculator. The large buttons work easily. It is accurate and loads quickly.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Love this cd/dvd-Darlene Zschech, Kari Jobe, Israel Houghton, Michael W Smith what a team of anointed worshipers.  If this music does not make you raise your hands and worship your Lord then your not listening to the lyrics.  Darlene is an awesome worship leader and her voice is amazing.  You will listen and watch this over and over. Praise God Almighty!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Becomes mundane after awhile. Need more stimulating prizes and greater rewards after all characters and prizes have been reached, and user has high score. Give right to change from Australia to New York.
B000MDJH9A|1.0|This movie was terrible; the acting and plot was very poor. Besides prostitutes, I don't know one woman who would have sex with a guy she has known for 5 minutes.  Absolutely hated this movie!
B00005U122|5.0|This was an incredible DVD. I have always liked PINK FLOYD and it was great to see and hear a very nice live perfomance. Excellent sound and video. If you like the FLOYD then you need to have this to enjoy! Roger Waters rocks!

0810993139|3.0|Diary of A Wimpy Kid By Jeff Kinney<br /><br />3 Stars<br /><br />Greg Heffley is entering middle school. He has the same fears, humiliations and insecurities that we all did upon being in the 6th grade. Middle School is a game of survival and you've got to find your way to make it through. Here you are thrown in a school along with kids 2 years older than you who could eat you for lunch. Not only do you have to deal with your peers but also your parents who are out to thwart any chance you have of being the cool kid. Greg tells his story of that first year in a diary filled with comics and comedy.<br /><br />I laughed while reading this. The situations Greg finds himself in reminded me so much of when I was young. Nothing ever worked out the way I wanted and always seemed to backfire on me. My parents or other siblings never understood what was so important. The author does an excellent job of capturing the mind set of children and their logic of the age. Looking at the world through their eyes and how important such small things are then.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love this cd had to get the. Online version. For my iPad and the deluxe version love Bruno mars music great variety of songs
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|I've followed Susan's career on and off, but this is the first CD I've purchased. I wasn't disappointed! I love her mellow tones, and she's chosen some truly excellent pieces for this collection.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend it to anyone who's a Susan fan, or loves this collection of stage songs.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy the game when I can figure out how to enter a room . There are many symbols which are not explained. The mystery of the game is how to play !
1423140605|5.0|Firstly, Rick Riordan is just a fantastic author. His stories are always great. As a fan of the Percy Jackson series I started the Heroes of Olympus series simply because it takes place afterwards. The Mark of Athena is the 3rd book in the Heroes of Olympus Series. I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite series, and is definitely as good, if not better than the original Percy Jackson Series. This is a must get for Percy Jackson fans or anyone that enjoys Greek or Roman mythology.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is the audience it is written for. I wish Rick Riordan would make his novels less child-ish and more towards young-adults. This is not a deal breaker though, they are appropriate for young readers and are still very enjoyable for young adults or even adults as well.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I'm a little late in watching the Frida movie. I loved the movie then just had to get the soundtrack. Did you know it was number 1? It's great! Even X years later.
0345529057|5.0|I received this item as a gift. I was looking to read the books after watching the first season of the show, these mass market paper backs were the perfect way to do it. The books come in a nice box that features Ned on one side as seen in the picture. I was really happy to see that the books maintained original covers as I hare when books use scenes from the movie/show as part of the cover. The books are your standard paperback that we are all familiar with and have survived 2 reads by myself and were also loved to a friend and are still in good condition, only a crease in the spine which is expected with a paper back. The type in the books is slightly small, but it is not something that would cause me to return the item or not recommend it to others, it is a paperback collection, small type is expected. You get all of these books for ~$20, you really just cannot beat the deal for such an incredible series. I would definitely recommend if you are interested in the show or fantasy novels.<br />Likewise the story is fantastic! George R. R. Martin creates a beautiful world with so much detail. Each novel will keep you guessing and on edge the entire time.. you will be right back on Amazon looking for a copy of A Dance with Dragons (the newest book in the series which is nit included in the bundle). Hopefully GRRM finishes the series soon...
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Glad i finally took the time to read it. The descriptive language paints (haha) a vivid picture, making me feel as if I were Dorian Gray's shadow.
0553801473|5.0|If you are like me and love the Song of Ice and Fire series you just have to get this and keep reading. The 4th novel  ( A Feast for Crows) was probably my least favorite in the series, mostly because the majority of my favorite characters were not in it and because so much happened in the 3rd book that the 4th just seemed slightly boring. George R. R. Martin delivers with A dance with Dragons though. So much happens in this book and some questions are starting to be answered. This is a must read for fantasy lovers and fans of the series. Please feel free to comment with any questions or theories about the series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site! Has so many great ideas! A+++++ rating tell all your friends you can follow your friends to see what they are looking at too!
034580404X|5.0|This is a nice set of the trilogy that I picked up for my girlfriend. Really good quality books that come in a nice little box to hold them all. It makes a great gift. Honestly, guys get this for your girlfriend/wife/mistress whatever, definitely worth it. Trust me.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|awesome movie!! of course when is a movie with Denzel bad?? This is a greats movie.  love it so muc
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have gotten hooked on this show.  A soap opera set in early 20th century England. Just makes you wish you  lived then, as part of the gentry, of course, not so much the servants.

B003Q97D48|5.0|I im in love with this! I would recomend this to anyone who is interested! you wont regret it! Go buy it!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Moved a little slow for my taste I have to admit. Still a good read though. It was the recent movie that turned me on to this series. Thought I would start with the first book. I think I will jump ahead for my next read. I am guessing they are not in order.
0452289963|5.0|Too much to say about Eckhart Tolle in this review... you need to expose yourself to his works to get it.  I started with audio books, which led to his videos, and then I had to have a copy of this book on my shelf in case I ever lost power and needed a read to help be find the stillness :)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down! I thought it was a crazy, emotional, heartbreaking, yet romantic love story. I would recommend!!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie is full of suspense and twists, turns and we loved it!  Not for small kids but everyone here is over 14 so fine for us to watch as a family.
B0064QNS62|1.0|I just didn't care for this game.  This one is not for me. The monster kept killing marv even when I hit him with the ax
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When starting Hopeless, I was not aware of the subject matter contained in it. Thankfully, because I had just finished reading a The Voice which deals with the abduction and rape of  a teenage girl and I don't think I would have jumped right into Hopeless knowing what I was getting myself into.<br /><br />Because I did not know where I was being led, Hopeless started off as more of a light-hearted read.  We meet Sky when she is about to begin her Senior year, her first at a public school.  Sky has spent the last thirteen years being homeschooled by her adopted mother, Karen. Her best friend lives only feet away from her but is leaving to study abroad in a matter of days. Sky knows her sheltered life is about to change in big ways but no one could expect it to completely shatter the way it does.<br /><br />Sky has spent her teenage years making out with boy after boy in an attempt to feel something. Anything.  She doesn't get the spark other girls get, there is no love, no lust, no want, no butterflies.  She knows she is getting a reputation, she knows it's stupid but the comfortably numb feeling she gets when with a boy she has no desire for is all she knows to do.<br /><br />  \\"Hopefully intelligence is measured by weight, and the few dumb decisions I've made will be outweighed by the intelligent ones. If that's the case, I'll need to make a shitload of smart decisions tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />All that changes when she meets Dean Holder. All the feelings she has spent a lifetime wondering about, seep into her and the confident girl she's been for so long hides in a corner of her heart while the insecure and flustered one takes the lead.  Holder is intense, to put it mildly, he worms into every piece of Sky and there is no turning away from the odd connection they have at first sight.<br /><br />  \\"This is lust? I hate it. I absolutely, positively hate this beautiful, magical feeling.\\"<br /><br />The relationship building between Sky and Holder was so adorable. If I had a son I would force him to read this book just to learn how a guy should talk to a girl.  Holder says the most amazing things, he's obviously a book boy written by a woman because I don't think guys like this really exist. If they do, there are woman lined up at their door around the clock just to get a little snippet of a swoon worthy line (among other things). I kind of want to make my husband read it, but he truly is hopeless so I'll save my breath there.<br /><br />  \\"You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\"<br /><br />See what I mean?  Sky is great though too.  She's honest and funny and doesn't let the silly things in life get her down. She's awkward about a lot of things most take for granted, due to her sheltered upbringing but it only served to make her more adorable and endearing.<br /><br />But that is just the first half of the book.  The second half of Hopeless is much darker, deeper, scarier and absolutely heartbreaking.  I'm not going to go into the nitty gritty, if you don't already have an idea of what Hopeless is about then hopefully you'll get the same experience I had while reading it.  I went from smiling sentence after sentence at the blooming relationship between two great characters to continuously having to pause to catch the breath I didn't realize I was holding.  Not long pauses, mind you, this was a book that had me up in to the wee hours of the morning. I could not put this remarkable journey down.<br /><br />This was my first Hoover read but I own Slammed and am even more anxious to get to it. Hoover's writing was exactly the style I love; she delivered wonderful, beautifully damaged characters in hard situations and laces it with just enough humor to keep it from turning into a depressing black hole.  Losing Hope (Hopeless #2), which is told from Holder's point of view, is due out in July and it is going to be an excruciatingly long wait.ged characters in hard situations and laces it with just enough humor to keep it from turning into a depressing black hole.  Losing Hope (Hopeless #2), which is told from Holder's point of view, is due out in July and it is going to be an excruciatingly long wait.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Beach Buggy Blitz (App) is a fun app to have for the Kindle fire.I like that you can switch control system from moving the kindle to tapping the screen.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is exicting, mysterious, and sometimes sob- making. There is some rude humor and bullying but August,the main character with a really,really deformed face,gets through. Best book ever i very much recommended it!!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is about a dystopian society where everyone is \\"cured\\" so they are free of the disease \\"love\\".  Lena is looking forward to this day, but complications occur to question her entire life.... Great book for young adults and adults!
B0002ONAM4|5.0|This album seems really fantastic, captures the essence of the band and all that time.<br />Ideal to add happiness to life.
B008393Q2O|3.0|The photo they have displayed for the Shopping list is spelled wrong! It has 1 p! If you want to sell it then make sure you spell check first!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great movie with fine historical basis. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing as Lincoln. Wonder though if Tommy Lee Jones required any makeup at all?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|what a voice. hit after hit after hit on this cd. glad it wasnt overpriced but feels like you should have had to pay more with that many great songs.
0307887898|5.0|This was a real eye opener at first I thought want and how could this be true, but once I understood the concept in the new online world and how thing happen so fast it makes perfect sense. Highly recommended.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|good music. entertaining fella seems to really enjoy performing. enjoyed listening to it going down the road, humming along with the cd.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This was a great movie about the bond of friendship and dignity.<br />One of the best ever...give it a try!
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, AND WAS A FANTASTIC REPRESENTATION OF TOMMY LEE JONES ABILITY AS AN ACTOR.
B00AI41PSY|1.0|This could be a good record but really it's a waste of vinyl. It has all the sound quality excitement of AM radio - no treble, no bass and no dynamics. Nice packaging though.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|What would you do if the people you love were murdered? Gerard Butler  as Clyde Shelton decides revenge is justified when Assistant District Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) agrees to a plea bargain. Having his wife and daughter killed and the killers 'get away with it' causes Shelton to seek his own form of justice. A gripping tale with excellent performances may make you rethink your opinion of our \\"justice\\" system (or maybe, what you already know?)  A well-crafted film to keep your interest from start to startling conclusion. Excellent
B005DJREJS|5.0|This is a cute show. Brought back some high school memories.  I watched season 1 & 2 I over a weekend. Can't wait for the next season.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I'm basing my rating based on the information provided by Amazon. Apparently this release includes only the 3D version even though they are charging a premium price. I loved this movie but ill be passing on this release if 2D is not included.
B00BNPZAEM|4.0|After reading a Rolling Stone article last fall about \\"Great Rock Recluses\\" - which counted Bowie among them and concluded that he'd retired - it was such a great pleasure to be surprised with the announcement of \\"The Next Day\\" in early January.  And upon repeatedly listenings, I agree with other reviewers that this is the best work he's done since Scary Monsters, and some of the best songs he's written since the hits on \\"Let's Dance\\".  I just love the Stars Are Out Tonight and - especially - I'll Take You There (can't believe it's a \\"bonus\\" track - this should be a single!)<br /><br />And I have to add: this has to the least expensive-to-design cover art in the history of popular music. (When I first saw it with the announcement of the Where Are We Now? video, I thought it was a mock-up/placeholder for the to-be album cover.)
030758836X|1.0|I do a lot of driving so I frequently buy audiobooks to pass the time.  I bought Gone Girl because it was on the best seller list and listened to it during several long road trips.  Several times I quit because the plot was such a stretch and the narration so excessively dramatic I just couldn't take it anymore.  But because it was so long and I was so invested in this piece of crap because of a particularly long drive, I pushed through and finished it.  Yes, the plot does have some fiendish twists, but it's also inconsitent and the narration is awful.  The female voice is barely tollerable but the male voice is excessively and drippingly dramatic.  Literally took everything I had to make it to the end.  The worst part of the book?  Beyond the bad reading and inconsistent plot (like she really would befriend strangers after being so careful in setting the whole thing up for a year - please), the worst part of the book by far is that it is morbidly depressing.  It will leave you feeling depressed and dirty unless you are the kind of person who enjoys reading about other people's misery.  There is nothing remotely uplifting about this story.  It's like 30 hours of lies, backstabbing, swearing, drinking, cheating, failing marriage, disrespecting of parents, incompetent cops and bad narrating.  It's one huge cliche.  I honestly wish I had followed my instincts and stopped listening after about an hour into it.  If it hadn't been for the 8 hour drive I would have.  I may be in the minority, but I love books and this one is about as bad as any I've \\"read\\" in a very long time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I did not become a fan of this series from the beginning. I found the first season to be a great foundation to understand the rest of it. Anybody interested in a good story, mixed in with key contemporary social and political issues will enjoy this series.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|I give it a three because it doesn't really stand out much from the MANY other 4 pics, games... but it definitely IS kid friendly and quite simple... (in MY opinion...)...<br /><br />1st person to try the game,<br /> ~NOT the listed name...
B006G3JQ78|4.0|We watched with our fam before we went to see the live musical. Kids liked it. An entertaining movie with great music.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|This is a neat app but it is not like the standard google screen i manover with.  I am getting the hang of it slowly.
B001NLKWLW|3.0|Once I finally got into the story I did enjoy it.  It took a little too long to hook me.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|So much easer to get morning/evening weather;  Morning show weather woman easy to look at but not as quick getting the info I need.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An excellent story. Two men who truly exemplify honor and gallantry. This should be required reading for today's Air Force.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Volbeat but I don't necessarily love every single song they make. I was not sure what to expect from this CD because they have a new guitarist and they are Danish so how could they have an &#34;American Old West&#34; theme and make it work?<br /><br />Well I am in LOVE with this CD after only one listen. The guitars are fuller, richer, and more complex than on previous Volbeat releases. Michael Poulson's vocals are stellar as usual. (No auto-tune here!)<br /><br />And somehow, they've managed to mix rock, metal, oldies, Latin, and folk styles to evoke the Old West. Does that make sense? Is it even possible? Somehow, Volbeat can do what no other rock/metal group these days is doing: take a bunch of totally familiar sounds, mix'em all up together, and come up with something original, intriguing, and highly listenable.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Buy this CD. Turn up the volume to 11 and put it on repeat. Enjoy!
B008B68IV8|5.0|This doll is all-around great. Dress and shoes are easy to get on and off. Dress has Velcro at the back. Hood at back of dress is just for show (not functional). Earrings will not get lost. Our doll's hair was not gelled. Surprisingly, her glasses stay on her face. Case is better than most of MH dolls' purses- roomier, and closes nicely. Great price here...pay no more than that, though. We got her for $10.00 at Wal-Mart (hey, I get what I need and then get out of there). My favorite Ghoulia. Five groans.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young has been a favorite of ours since the 60's so there really isn't much to say except that yes we love this one too.  The seller is five stars also, fast shipping and we got what we wanted as expected.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This was mediocre at best. Bond movies are getting worse every release. Without some fresh, innovative writing, I think it may b time to retire Bond.
B00A3YECY8|5.0|Although I must to confess I would liked find a full version. The Divine comedy with The Doré Illustration. Thanks.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les mis is a emotionally and moving piece of art work. As much a romance now there are still some bits which were originally meant to be. I would strongly recommend this movie to everyone. Hope this helped
B005URRCUY|5.0|THis is an AWESOME album. I love the Black Keys!! I need to go out and buy their albums before this and Brothers.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|If you pair it with the right CPU, this is the best form factor I know.  Same power as a tower in 1/4 the footprint.  It feels like a quality product when you build your machine.<br /><br />No issues whatsoever.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Really great & funny soundtrack. The mix songs in the movie are the same.<br /><br />You will enjoy it same as the movie.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Think it is a cute game wish it didn't kick me off as much as it does. The different types of dragons are great would like to breed them and get the new ones without always getting what I have but over all I like this game beautiful surroundings.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|These are classic. Used for decades to mix some of the world's greatest music they will leave you very happy. Small beef is that the ear cushions are plastic and feel like it. I had a pair of these when I was in the music biz many years ago so expected that. I forgot how great they sound however and am blown away by the detail and ambiance they deliver. A word of warning though. First, you will know how good your gear is because you will hear that through these. I plugged it into my Ipod though and it was magical. So forget earbuds, even good ones. Once you touch cashmire you can never go back to wool.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|this band is so awesome....raw, and for real music....almost as if it were recorded in their garage. totally soulful, bluesy, heady musical rifts, and excellent lyrics. I love this band, and hope this is the first of many releases!
B008AT71WI|5.0|Richard Conway and his model department labored for nearly a year to film<br />the original climactic ending of the film-where the Plants conquer the world.<br />This Technicolor B-movie extravaganza was subsequently sent to the scrap heap,<br />because it was rejected by audiences in test screenings.<br />We can now judge for ourselves:<br />The original dark, sardonic ending is the only logical outcome of the plot,<br />as it is obvious that, from the beginning, the Mean Green Mother runs<br />the show, and uses gullible Seymour Krelborn to its own nefarious ends.<br />Compared to the DVD of the theatrical release:<br />[[ASIN:B00004RF8J Little Shop of Horrors (Snap Case Packaging)]],<br />image quality is much improved.<br />This Blu-ray has a user-friendly, multi-tiered menu feature that displays<br />on the screen all the contents and selections of the disc.<br />There are optional English SDH for all the extras.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addicting. CHALLENGING. Great selection of rewards, characters, boards. Best of all its FREE!! If you've played temple run you'll love this game.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I don't usually like the &#34;tough cop&#34; stories but Harry Bosch is hard to not like.  Underneath that crustiness is a principled heart that is a great foil for the graphic crimes he works.  How Connelly consistently churns these out while maintaining quality is amazing.
B009K86D86|5.0|I think everyone needs to see this.... This is a Huge eye opener and should be mandatory material in schools! Very well thought out and you can tell that this is a quality presentation.
B00513DGIO|5.0|I think it is essential reading for anyone interested in economics or finance. No, it isn't about today, but it puts what's happening today in an historical context - something the newspapers or TV will never do for you. Creditors and debtors have been around a long time and much of our history has been determined by how the two groups interact.
1616550414|3.0|The rating is not a reflection on the book itself, but rather Amazon's handling of the book prior to shipping it out. The box it was shipped in was fine, but the actual book has several areas around the edge where it looks like it got bumped into things. Being a hard cover book, you can't just bend it back into shape. Quite sad considering this was purchased to keep as a collector's item.<br /><br />Regarding the content, I've only flipped through a few pages, looks excellent, but I've accidentally spoiled a major plot line from Skyward Sword in the process so I've put the book down with the intention of going back to it once I've finished the game (been too busy with other things to get to it).
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I bought one at the coldplay show , then i ordered one for the car, then over christmas my mother fell in love with this cd, so i ordered another copy! Love this cd. The best modern album in years, my favorite of coldplay's records. If the beatles had come out in the past ten years instead of the 1960's they'd sound like coldplay does right now! :-)
B006T5C5PS|4.0|This book has all the information you need to follow the diet and nutritional supplements. For a clean eating regimen you don't feel like it's too restrictive other than it gets boring. It's actually a challenge to eat as much as they recommend and do the juicing, but then I was not ill.<br />The writing style and organization is awkward, so one must hunt and pull out the specific instructions rather than they being listed in a logical fashion.<br />The reasons behind this plan are very interesting. Too bad our medical people are not more educated in food as medicine.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this movie - and there is only one other musical that I watch (Cats).  Le Miserables was a story, a beautiful story.  If you don't typically like musicals, try this anyway!
B009NXAMW6|4.0|The movie was well directed and excellent acting. This is a hard rating to give, as to not give away the plot.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I recommend this movie, to bad I didn't see it in the big screen. The comp animation is so real
B005ETA5K2|2.0|I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO AMPLIFY MY WIFI SIGNAL FROM THE PORT OF ENTRY TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. NO SIGNAL GAIN WAS OBSERVED, MY PRODUCTS IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE STILL LOST SIGNAL OR SHOWED WEAK SIGNAL.<br /><br />I WILL BE RETURNING THIS PRODUCT.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Innocent by Baldacci is another intriging, fast moving read by this author. I had planned for this read to be a standby activity during a recent cruise in the Carribean. The cruise was excellent but I devoted a little extra time to this read such that it only lasted for half the cruise. I am confident those who have enjoyed other Baldacci books will quickly get to the back cover of this one.
B000AO4NJA|5.0|I purchased this for my Motown loving sister.  We sing these songs all the time.  Great to listen to anytime and small children love dancing to his music.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I used to have an older version on my PC and it was &#34;ok&#34; but this version is great!  The graphics are much better and the game itself flows much smoother.  The colors are beautiful and some of the pictures make you want to stop for a bit and just look at the detail.  Great doctors office, airport, etc. game.  Very addictive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is written in an unusual style with surprising twists, including the ending.  I would recommend it to those who enjoy a good mystery.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Troubling,fast paced,thriiller. This is the second book by Flynn I have read. Would read another.  This one is hard to put down.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|G5 has better games for the money. After I paid the full amount I found out it was almost the end of the game. Had I known this I never would have purchased this game. It was way too short. It ended so abruptly I didn't feel satisfied even though it was interesting and held my attention. The end offered little explanation in order to have a sense of conclusion.

B004JK61K0|4.0|I bought K-9 Mail to use on my Kindle Fire.  I don't have an Android phone (nor do I want one).  The Kindle will be used at the marina this Summer on their Wi-Fi network to check weather, tides and keep up with two email accounts.<br />Once K-9 is set up it's very easy to use.

B00BF123WG|5.0|So I just watched this Movie \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\".<br /><br />It was OK.<br /><br />But I still don't see how the American Casualties of the \\"9/11\\" World Trade Center Attack are considered \\"Victims\\"..., when US Tax Payers Finance the US Military..., which has been known to commit Human Rights Violations against it's own Citizens & Foreigners? (i.e. Tailhook Scandal & Abu Ghraib Prison Scandal; & also Questioning how many Crimes committed by US Troops have gone UnReported?)<br /><br />Perhaps these Foreigners are Retaliating against the US, for Crimes committed against them by US Soldiers?<br /><br />Then the US has the Gall to turn & call them Terrorists?<br /><br />It appears to me that the US Tax Payers were finally held accountable for Crimes Committed by their Military.<br /><br />Was 9-11-2001 Karma coming Full Circle?<br /><br />This Film Clearly Depicts the US committing Human Rights Violations. (i.e. Water-Boarding & Subjecting Humans to Cruel & Degrading Punishment). (Ref: United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights Article 5)<br /><br />We all have been taught \\"Two Wrongs don't make a Right\\"<br /><br />I also found the Film had Feminine Overtones, perhaps because it was Directed by a Woman? Not to mention how Hypocritical & Unattractive it is to see Allegedly \\"Intelligent\\" Women Smoking!<br /><br />I felt the Dialogue by the Special Forces Team Member which implied Homosexuality was inappropriate. (i.e. Being thrown into a Pakistan Prison)<br /><br />The Film also implied Excessive Spending by Government, at the Height of the Economic Recession, when revealing a Top Secret Stealth Helicopter Program, & when at the End of the Film the Agent was the Only Person riding on a C-130 Flight.<br /><br />The Film also Excluded how Obama & other Top Officials watched the Operation via a Live Video Stream, eluding Reporters attending an Award Ceremony Dinner.<br /><br />So for these reasons, I felt the Film was Good, but not Great when seeing things from my Alternative Perspective.
B000HKYN74|5.0|As an original Star Trek Fan I wanted to see this version and was not dissipointed.  Seasons 1, 2 and 4 are OK but Season 2 Episode 26 &#34;The Expanse&#34; sucked me in deep.  All of season 3 episodes were great and I couldn't get enough of it.<br />I really enjoyed this series.
B001O54NL2|5.0|Mighty nice for his self-titled album finally released in Audio disc format. Another example of lesser known and celebrated talent that definitely didn't get its just recognition and praise. Didn't realize until checking the track list that he was the original source for the smash hit, &#34;Sailing&#34;. You really do learn something new every day. This lesson, in particular, was a refreshingly delightful one, at that.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I had seen the books around but having grown tired of the teen and YA genre as a whole I never picked them up anywhere. Then I saw the trailer for the movie and I just had to check it out. And I'm very happy I did. Ms. Clare's wonderful writing, plot, and characters really reminded me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer of which I am a fan. I have also read her other series The Infernal Devices as well, and enjoyed it, though not as much as the original series. Well done, Ms. Clare, well done.

0061950726|4.0|As a work of historical fiction, a piece of genealogical interest, a story of redemption, an interesting narrative of the value of inter-generational communications, this is a great piece on many levels. It is also extremely well written. The narrators were amazing (I used whispersync because I couldn't put the book down and needed the audio version to get back to doing mindless housework) and added so much to the enjoyment. My only regret is that there was so much profanity in the modern-day section. I suppose it was a purposeful effort to draw a distinction between the generations, but for me it was jarring and unnecessary, particularly with the level of writing in this book. I only wish I could find an edited version to share!

B000063DFQ|4.0|Armed with Bruce Dickinson behind the mic, and Nicko McBrain behind the trapkit, Iron Maiden boasted what was largely considered to be the definitive line-up. Hence, it shouldn't really come as a surprise to many people that the band released another great album, their fourth, in 1983's \\"Piece Of Mind.\\" What is surprising about this release is that it was very likely, Maiden's most progressive effort to date. So even though \\"Mind\\" does not mark a substantial musical or creative leap forward for the band, it is nevertheless still filled with the good stuff: Really technical and unique-sounding bass lines (from four-string ace Steve Harris), inventive guitar work (including some of the band's all-time finest guitar soloing -- soloing that never ceases to amaze me, even after giving it repeat listens), and stellar, soaring vocals.<br /><br />Opener \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" kicks off with a deft drum intro, followed by aggressive, sub-speed metal-esque riffs, and a strong, prominently grumbling bass bottom. Said song is also of note for opening up to allow an extensive, epic instrumental break (complete with a terrifically soaring, harmonized guitar solo). And its ending is also noteworthy, as it features a dexterously slapped bass part. \\"Revelations\\" is a very epic and expansive-in-scope follow-up number that pushes the seven-minute-long mark. It is partially acoustic balladry and partially heavy and hard-rocking. There are soaring, soulfully-sung vocals and simplistic-yet-effective, galloping guitar hooks throughout, and the tune also lets fly another lengthy and winding melodic solo. And whether opting for melodic or heavy fare, Steve Harris' bass always remains strong and propulsive.  Next comes the record's lead single, \\"Flight Of Icarus,\\" which has Maiden's classically catchy, galloping rhythms threaded by Harris' speedy, humming bass lines, and iced by more epically soaring and infectious guitar soloing. A really unforgettable chorus is also included, here, thus helping to make sure that this lead single is a surefire hit, too.<br /><br />\\"Die With Your Boots On,\\" then, is the perfect follow-up to the above-described \\"Flight Of Icarus,\\" as it has a fast, near speed-metal-esque tempo, and is driven by some more of Harris' unique and nimble-fingered bass riffs. Another killer chorus is included, here, as well, but it is nearly overshadowed by the song's blistering melodic solo runs, which are even more memorable. Next up we have \\"The Trooper,\\" which is not only the album's epic centerpiece, it is also another hit single. Its fiery, crunchy riffs, steady, grumbling bass fills, and brisk tempo builds well into the track's choruses, which are highlighted by more really memorable and catchy vocal patterns. And, of course, one must not forget to mention the fantastic and terrifically wailing and amazing-every-time guitar solo section. Following this comes \\"Still Life,\\" a lovely acoustic ballad. It might end rather abruptly, sure, but this small flaw is easy to overlook after hearing the tune's splendidly harmonic, soaring, and ripping solo flights.<br /><br />Then, following the catchy and galloping \\"Quest For Fire,\\" we are dealt a thundering bass line in the intro of \\"Sun And Steel.\\" This, then, flows perfectly into a catchy, crunchy beat, up-tempo, aggressive, and belligerent riffing, and nifty, slapped bass lines. But it's almost impossible to make up one's mind about which is more impressive: The above-described music or the memorable, soaring vocals that make-up the infectious and anthemic choruses. But either way -- either option you choose -- you can only win. Finally, the set wraps up by serving the listener with another really progressive and epic set closer in the form of \\"To Tame A Land.\\" It is a fairly prototypical Iron Maiden song, as it begins with a nicely proggy acoustic intro before morphing into speedy bass playing and excellent, twin-guitar harmonies. The second half of \\"To Tame...\\" is entirely instrumental, and it climaxes with another spectacular, trade-off melodic solo section.<br /><br />While not nearly as essential as, say, \\"Powerslave,\\" \\"The Number Of The Beast,\\" \\"Killers,\\" or even \\"The Final Frontier,\\" \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is still a pretty darn great album, and easily one of the best hard rock and pure/traditional heavy metal releases of the 1980's.limaxes with another spectacular, trade-off melodic solo section.<br /><br />While not nearly as essential as, say, \\"Powerslave,\\" \\"The Number Of The Beast,\\" \\"Killers,\\" or even \\"The Final Frontier,\\" \\"Piece Of Mind\\" is still a pretty darn great album, and easily one of the best hard rock and pure/traditional heavy metal releases of the 1980's.

B0038ZITIE|5.0|I loved this movie when I was 13 and I still love it.  Glad I was able to find it on DVD.  I showed it to my 8 year old and he loved it.  Vultan's &#34;Gordon's Alive!&#34; was awesome like always.  Awesome cast Max Von Sydow as Ming, Timothy Dalton as Barron and Brian Blessed as Vultan.  You can't get much better.  Bummed that it was supposed to be a trilogy and this was the only one made.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I just so happened to watch an episode on tv and was instantly hooked. I then went back and watched all the previous episodes to get to where I was at. It didn't disappoint. Highly recommend it!
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Very interesting for advocates of earlier UFO visitations. Your history should be examined and archeologists and scientists should really  consider the possibility.

076421120X|5.0|Although cautioned not to judge a book by its cover, the first thing the reader notices is the beautifully designed hardcover of Revealing Jesus.  This beautiful book is a companion to the album of music by the same name.  It is ideal for Christians looking for inspirational readings on the passion and resurrection of Christ and is perfect for gift-giving.<br /><br />The book is a 365 day format with uplifting readings for each day.  Each daily reading has a Bible verse, a short reflection and a prayer to help apply the topic of the day's message.  Written by songwriter-performer Darlene Zschech, each reflection provides revelation, motivation and comfort in the lesson.  Revealing Jesus is a book to keep, bookmark, love, and read, year after year for Christians who want to grow closer to their Savior.  Revealing Jesus can only bring readers joyfully closer to Him, day by day.<br /><br />Those who are familiar with Darlene Zschech's songs, including Shout to the Lord, will love this companion book.  All readers who wish for a closer relationship with Jesus will love this opportunity to spend a few minutes with Him each day, learning how to know and  serve Him better.<br /><br />I was given a free copy of this book by Bethany House Publishers to read and review.  I highly recommend Revealing Jesus to readers of all ages.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|I never went to see this movie when it was out because of all of the bad reviews, so I bought this on a whim. If you're a fan of the John Carter on mars series of books, I think that you'll be a fan of this movie. Escape-ist fantascy yes; but that's what it's supposed to be. i think over time, this film will prove the critics wrong and audiences will wonder why Disney didn't proceed in making films (sequels) to all of the other books in the John Carter series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|He loves it! Hasn't put it down yet. He has many other games, but likes the fast pace of this game.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Great movie, received it in the case with everything as it is supposed to be. This movie is such a classic everyone should own a copy. The DVD case did arrive cracked, but that was more likely a problem that occurred in shipping. this gets 5 stars from me because it is a great movie, and a good price.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a very nice camera backpack case at 2 or 3 times lower price than other&#34; name brands &#34; I looked at. Just returned from Florida, where I used it for first time and it held all my gear, DSLR body, 3 lenses, batteries, flash and a small point & shoot camera, extra sd cards, filters. It is small but holds lots of gear with plenty of padding and went in overhead on plane easily. I love it. Thanks.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I actually enjoy all the songs on this album.  I don't pay attention to the words the first few times I listen to an album, I like to hear how everything sounds from one track to the next.  This album doesn't really flow that well to me, but the individual songs on their own are good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An outstanding app for just about anything you would use your physical Bible for. The devotional topic selection is huge and I have thoroughly impressed with the variety and readability of each section.
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Dr. McDougall is all over the internet sharing his decades of research of starchy foods as staples of many cultures.  It is hard to argue with his findings, but I am still going to limit my intake of potatoes and white rice.
0307887448|5.0|Such a great book, for me.  Filled with pop culture reference and full of role-plying/geek lore.  I love this book and will love it again the next time I read it.<br /><br />The story is pretty solid, the plot moves forward at a decent pace, and it's clearly researched with otaku like fervor.  Well, probably more \\"lived\\" than researched, but you know what I mean...<br /><br />I recommend this book to all geeks of a certain age and those that love them.

B00138H68M|5.0|It may owe a fair amount to the early Talking Heads, but it's quite a stunner in its own right. Excellent debut.
6304712936|2.0|The film, Amadeus, is 5 STARS!  This version is only 2 stars.  I first had Amadeus on VCR tape, then decided to upgrade to the director's cut.  Bad idea.  Although the 2-disc director's cut comes with lots of extras on the second disc, the flow and intensity of the original film is lost in a muddle of extra scenes, which are in no way critical to the story.  In fact, not only do the extra scenes interrupt the pacing of the film, but they change it entirely.  So I decided to get the original version on DVD.  This is the best version, however, halfway through the film, you have to flip the disc over!  I can't understand the reasoning behind this when the director's cut, with the extra footage, was on one side only.  I have Gone With The Wind on DVD, which is also a \\"flipper\\", and I never watch it because of this.  What gives?  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.  This is a major disruption to the flow of the story.  And if you want to switch to a different scene at the other end of the film, you have to flip it again.  Added to that, this version is AWFUL QUALITY! It is fuzzy, with fine lines and blips running through it.  This is why I gave 2 stars.  Is there a one-disc version which is all on one side??  Does anyone know?
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I've read the first four books of the five book series. One of my favorite series. The HBO video version is very well done however, like other movie versions of books, I wouldn't understand it as well had I not read the books. The video series follows the books pretty well.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|My favorite album of the year. Why haven't you bought it yet? You are missing out! Put it in, sit back, relax, and enjoy!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This is my second set of 7506s. My older set is still working fine after 7+ years of use -it only needed replacement of the nylon covers on the still-comfortable ear pads at about 4.5 years. I think I paid about $6-7 for a pair of covers here at Amazon. I've tried a few under-$200 headphones and have not found anything to compare to the 7506s in terms of both flat-true sound reproduction, comfort, and compactness. On the latter, I am submitting a photo that compares the sizes of the 7506 to a pair of the also-excellent Audio-Technica M-50. I got a bad sample of the M50, but I would have tried a second pair if not for their size. I think the compactness of these 7506s is an under-rated feature.<br /><br />My new 7506s are as good as my prior set, although they're a little more base-enhanced, and the coiled cord stretches about 10 feet max, which is couple of feet less that my older pair. Each of these features may be preferred by some, and it is possible that each difference is attributable to age, I especially appreciate that the new phones are as comfortable, and that their build quality is as good as ever.<br /><br />If anyone can recommed a pair that may be a step up to these fine phones, in either an open or closed design, in the under-$200-at-Amazon category, and that is equally compact or nearly-so, please add a comment to this review. Thank you. Enjoy the music regardeless of how you reproduce it.<br /><br />EDIT/UPDATE: As for build quality, the nylon cover on the right ear pad began to come undone at about 7 months. On my original 7506s, the pads lasted about 5 years. I am posting a photo to illustrate the problem with my 8-month-old headphones. Bummer, shame; now I'll have to hassle with a change and add $10-20 to the cost of the these Sony favorites.

B006M4F67A|4.0|I now have six different Majong games loaded into my Kindle Fire HD, as well as several on my PC, and this is by far my favorite.  I have been through all of the layouts at least once and am currently working on trying to beat the times that have been recorded on my previous try.  I have not always succeeded, and that is the challenge.  I would recommend this for all who enjoy Majong.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|This game is really well made and runs smooth. Another reviewer mentioned it already that it is somewhat like mario, but less busy and a little more hyper as the levels progress. For the .99 price, more than worth it. And if you can get it as free app of the day from amzn like moi, bonus! Love it!

0446580848|1.0|Evidently DeMille has sacrificed his writing talent to become a standup comedian, and not a very good one. Like everyone else who posted one or two stars for this loser of a novel, I quickly became disgusted with the lack of plot, the overabundance of sarcastic remarks and silly chitchat, and mostly with John Corey, who has to be one of the most irritating main characters I've ever had the displeasure of reading about. The handwriting was on the wall well before page 70, at which point I bailed.<br /><br />\\"The Panther\\" is a tome with nothing between the covers. It's not just mediocre; it's downright godawful, a time-suck that's neither engrossing nor addictive. Do yourself a favor and save your money.<br /><br />I wonder if DeMille ever reads any of these reviews. He really should. The guy needs a wakeup call and so does his editor.<br /><br />Update, 4/21/13:  Mainly because of an injured knee and being chair-bound without much to read, I decided to give \\"The Panther\\" a second chance. It does get better, but not much, and not until the last 100 or so pages. On a scale of one to ten, I still wouldn't give it more than a two.<br /><br />Terrorism is a fairly serious subject, but John Corey seems to think everything has to be funny. To reiterate, the story has more one-liners than substance, as well as too many irrelevant tangents and too much governmental wheel-spinning. Granted, that might be a way of life in the real world, but it doesn't read well. The entire story, if tightened up--even with more effort devoted to plot--could easily be 250 pages shorter.<br /><br />DeMille clearly opted for childish humor at the expense of character development. Corey is an annoying, egotistical jerk with few redeeming qualities. His wife, who is only slightly more fleshed out than a stick figure, comes across as an idiot for putting up with him. Bulus ibn al Darwish is little more than a shadow with a beard. And Paul Brenner, who was well characterized and likeable in \\"Up Country\\", completely lacks personality in \\"The Panther.\\" The other actors in this farce are so bland that you'll have trouble keeping them straight.<br /><br />Let's face it: A book that's the size of Webster's Dictionary needs to be better, and this one is lacking on too many levels. As far as I'm concerned, the most interesting aspect of the entire novel was finding out which of the two ladies Paul Brenner stuck with at the conclusion of \\"Up Country\\"--Susan Weber or Cynthia Sunhill. The rest is pretty much a waste of paper.
0345803485|3.0|Book 3 was actually my favorite, since it had a little more drama to it and the ending was fine.<br /><br />So my rating for Book One is 3 stars and Fifty Shades Freed is 5 stars
1400069742|5.0|Most of us who know how the US got into World War II view the history from way high up:  despite the myopic domestic isolationist forces and organizations, Roosevelt skillfully manipulates public opinion while initiating a series of small steps until the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, when we declare war on Japan, Germany declares war on us, and we declare war on Germany and Italy.<br /><br />We so blur the details that we actually have a false view.  The isolationist sentiment was by no means confined to yahoos and rubes.  Indeed, several later very prominent figures -- Kingman Brewster, Sargent Shriver, and Gerald Ford among them -- began as actors on the isolationist side.  World War I had stengthened pacifism in the US, even among liberals.  As for the President's leadership, Roosevelt liked to speak boldly and then let the practical implementation slide.  Lend-Lease, more show than substance, took an unconscionably long time before a reasonable supply of materiel reached Britain, and it was largely due to Roosevelt's unwillingness to act, even when polls showed large majorities in favor of his positions.  The \\"court-packing\\" fiasco had made him so timid, he invariably had a more pessimistic view of the mood of the country than was warranted by the facts.  At least three confrontations in the North Atlantic before Pearl Harbor should have led to declarations of war.  Furthermore, Roosevelt refused to move the economy from a consumer to a war basis, because he didn't want to alienate either consumers (who had begun to enjoy a higher standard of living) or manufacturers (who liked the profits from consumer goods).  Plants turned out automobiles rather than tanks.  The army was so underequipped it hadn't the materiel even for training.  Recruits aimed hollow pipes, play bazookas, at trucks with the word \\"tank\\" painted on the side.  Roosevelt's indecision drove General George Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, and Henry Stimson, Secretary of War, nuts.  Roosevelt apparently waited for some unequivocal sign, which, I admit, the attack on Pearl Harbor provided.  However, his stasis almost cost Britain (and perhaps us) the war.<br /><br />Olson addresses two more major themes.  First, the public diplomacy and the largely-clandestine British effort to turn the country from isolation to intervention got me to gasp with admiration, as did the sly maneuvers of the American Century Group.  While the British essentiallly set up our espionage capability, both they and certain quietly influential Americans managed to turn a good deal of the isolationist sentiment to the necessity of fighting the Axis.  Second, Olson's study of Lindbergh, the face of American isolationism, reveals one rather weird dude -- a naive technocrat, almost incapable of empathy, who brought vilification not only on himself, but on his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, who had tried and failed to talk him out of his more egregious comments.  Olson also makes clear the smear campaign against Lindbergh, prosecuted particularly by Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior and apparently the administration's pit bull, convinced (wrongly) that Lindbergh wanted to become the American Fuehrer.  Lindbergh never completely lived down the charge of Antisemite.  Although he did view Jews as \\"other\\" than \\"Americans,\\" he wasn't ever personally vicious, like Gerald L. K. Smith or Father Coughlin.  He shared the beliefs of a lot of Americans -- Antisemitic by reflex and custom rather than by conviction.  Remember, during this period, among other things, many elite universities had strict quotas on admitting Jews, when they admitted them at all, and George Gershwin, instantly recognizable at the time, was denied a hotel room because he was a Jew.  Significantly, Lindbergh kept the respect and friendship of his wife's family, the Morrows, staunch interventionists.<br /><br />Olson's prose is clear and serviceable.  However, her talent as a storyteller stands out.  This is involved, convoluted stuff, and she manages to unsnarl the knots while including a generous supply of detail.  Time after time, she brings complex personalities to dramatic life.  This book makes you forget you're reading.  I've lost major chunks of time, where I don't even remember turning the pages but find myself significantly further in the tale.  I know how it comes out, of course, but the road to there fascinates me.
0345803493|3.0|This book is talked about on the radio, TV talk shows, beauty parlors, doctor's offices, gym etc. Good to read but no substance

B009OYSFDM|5.0|Excellent TV series about comic character Green Arrow, or The Vigilante, as he is referred to in this series.  Stephen Amell is great as the lead character and manages to make the premise truly believable.  Supporting characters Diggle and Felcity provide a humor and wit that keeps the show from becoming too dark.

B00AWE9TCE|5.0|My son received this for his 6th birthday and although he normally has no problem putting together sets that are rated 8-14 years, he did need help.  So, the level of difficulty is accurate but he still loved it.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|A DVD is a DVD is a DVD, so I won't comment on the DVD itself except for the fact that the quality of the picture was totally outstanding.  Watching it on a large-screen, hi def TV was like watching it on a screen in movie theatre.  As to the content: superb.  Daniel Day-Lewis was unbelievable as Lincoln and Sally Field was non-pariel as Mary Todd Lincoln.  I particularly like Tommy Lee Jones's performance.  I recommend this anyone who wants a truly one-of-a-kind look into the world of the 13th Amendment and the trials and tribulations Lincoln faced getting it approved.  Bravo.

B000I14UTS|5.0|I watched it several times.  It was so revolutionary for the times.  Liza is so beautiful.  The songs are great.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it's simply impossible to go into as much detail as you'll find in the book(s).  Noticeably missing were several of the characters' back-stories that I felt were crucial to the storyline.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I have been grown up religiously, but, rather than by the question &#34;Does God exist?&#34;, &#34;Should I believe?&#34;, I read this book (on advice of friends) because of the questions: why do men believe in religion? Why do they need it? Why do different individuals and cultures have different religions? Does religion really fill cognitive &#34;gaps&#34; that could not otherwise be accounted for?<br /><br />I was delighted to see these questions addressed with both rigorous logic and an enjoyable account of facts and pieces of information. Not all books address problems in a rigorous, reasonable, logical way; and not all books can concile rigour and logical accuracy with a choice of facts and pieces of information that are consistent with the discussion and still make it enjoyable.<br /><br />The facts and the pieces of information are organized, chapter by chapter, around different topics, that cover several aspects of the question of religion in a comprehensive way. There are books that concentrate on the serious phylological problems pertaining to the Bible, others that exclusively deal with the evolution-Creationism struggle, others that study the psychological and sociological roots of the need for religion, and still others that focus on the dangers of religion. Here you will find all of that.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most? A couple of aspects I did not know or had not considered: the fact that agnosticism, which I had respected as reasonable so far, is just as untenable as religion itself if you reason it out; that the Bible cannot be considered a source of ethics, because what we actually do today is to &#34;pick&#34; some specific principles from it, and discard those that are unacceptable (like giving away your daughter to be raped, which happens a couple of times in the Old Testament) - a process that implies that we actually use something else than the Bible itself to select &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad&#34; principles; and the problem of &#34;chance&#34; in evolutionism versus creationism: creationists forget that the alternative to chance is not just intelligent design, but evolution, which is not chance at all and is much more likely than intelligent design. Also, it is illuminating to hear that every time that creationist point to a &#34;missing link&#34; in evolution, some years later the missing link is unavoidably discovered by biologists. This was interesting because the &#34;missing link&#34; argument had struck me as viable when I was in medical school, and I had discussed it with a professor of Physiology.<br /><br />I therefore recommend this book to people who want the topic addressed with these two approaches: rigorous logics, and comprehensiveness. The book also works as an overall introduction to people who would then like to move on to more specific aspects of the question. For instance, at the moment I do not need to read anything more about the contradictions of the Bible or the bad consequences of religion (persecutions, discrimination and so on), but I would like to read more on the &#34;meme theory&#34;, which biologists, mathematicians and sociology can use to explain the features of existing religions, and the latest advances in evolutionism.<br /><br />Have I become atheist? I am not yet sure if I still am a believer as I used to be, if I have moved on to agnosticism (which Dawkins convincingly shows to be as unreasonable as religion itself!), but to deny that these arguments are compelling would be an insult to my mind. A mind that should be all the more respected by those who say it was designed by a god.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewel Star is a fun game that is good for passing time. I haven't had any problems with it loading or playing. If you like Bejewled or Ruby Blast then this is a good substitute for android devices.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Director Joseph Kosinski has two films on his resume: one was scored by Daft Punk, the other by M83.  Clearly that's a dynamic that he finds very interesting, and it pays off quite well.  Each of those scores is a significant departure for their respective bands' typical musical stylings, but each is nevertheless excellent.  While I overall prefer Daft Punk's Tron Legacy soundtrack, M83's work here is also great, with quite a few fantastic pieces.  &#34;Waking Up,&#34; &#34;StarWaves,&#34; &#34;Earth 2077,&#34; and &#34;Oblivion&#34; are my favorites, and there are a few more excellent tracks that certainly earn the album's full price (and certainly the current $5 promotional price).<br /><br />Interestingly, while Daft Punk was not involved with this score, there are at least a few songs on it that sound like they could've come straight out of Tron Legacy.  This would seem to suggest that Kosinski is a fairly hands-on director when it comes to his films' scores, although the similarities could just be coincidental.  At any rate, M83's work here isn't quite as consistently great as Daft Punk's work on Tron, and there are more than a few tracks that don't quite distinguish themselves, and sort of amount to &#34;filler,&#34; but those are definitely outweighed by the standout tracks.<br /><br />Long story short: if you liked the Tron Legacy score, you'll like this one as well.  If you like M83, you'll almost definitely like this score (especially the final song, which may be a little more akin to their standard music than the rest of the album).  I strongly recommend it.

B009R659L8|1.0|I actually am only 2 chapters into this book because I have to adjust each page in order to read the entire page.  I have to increase or decrease the font, the line spacing and how it fits on the page.  Even then, some of the text from the previous page repeats on the next page.  In all the Kindle books I've bought this is the first time I've had this issue.  It is so frustrating, I cannot get into the story itself because of this and I love Mary Higgins Clark books.  I refuse to buy the hardcover since I've already bought the Kindle version.
0062014536|5.0|I loved Requiem. I was a little upset because it was the last book in my favorite series. I'm not sure if Lauren Oliver is going to write another young adult series, but I hope she does. When I found out the book had alternating points of view between Hana and Lena, I was a little nervous. Usually I can't stand alternating points of view in a book. However, it worked in Requiem. I was glad the reader got to see Hana's point of view. I liked her. I was sad when she wasn't in Pandemonium. I couldn't stand Hannah's husband, Fred. He was a complete jerk. I can't even think of words to describe how well written the book is. I felt like I was in the story following Lena and Hana on their adventures. I was happy with Lena's decision on who she wanted to be with. I think the other person would have been completely wrong for her. The ending of the book left me with goosebumps. It was beautifully written. The Match Trilogy could take some notes from the Delirium Trilogy about how to write the final book in a trilogy.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|this is just about all you need for your collection of classics.  gives you a well balanced mixture of all of the bands talents, if you like them you must have this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My 2d favorite series.  A book that once I read the first time, had to read again.  A book you didn't want to end.  The characters are real and you can relate to them.  The situations and settings are believeable--you immmediately, put yourself right in to the time and place of the book.  It's got everything:  romance (of course, but not smarmy at all, adventure, suspense and it has a moral.  I've read the series two times!  Suzanne Collins weaves a great tale.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|This is a bit of a contrived movie but if you just go with it it's fun. I liked the music and it brought back a lot of memories for me. The main thing I didn't like about it is Alec Baldwin! That guy can't sing and is, in my opinion, a really lousy actor. They could've replaced him with any of a thousand other actors out there and the movie would've been better.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Main character Jenna, by all accounts, is a sane and realistic teenager. This however doesn't save her for the bullying and awkwardness of high school.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I finished all the levels in less than 2 weeks, but I like that I can go back and try for a better time.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I liked the way the story was written -  in the form of a question and answer. As a reader, I felt like I was part of the story, part of the group. As I read along, it felt like I was the one getting my questions answered because some of the questions posed by the characters are ones which I have also wondered about myself.  This is the best part of Paulo Coelho's books because it often leaves me with a lot of room for reflection. It was with a great deal of regret when I finished reading the last page of the book. I have reread it a few more times and each time, it just gets better. Will be eagerly waiting for the next book.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Paid 5.99 to stream it over roku from amazon, but after numerous failed attemps at streaming it, i gave up. Amazon did send me a 2.99 promotion code to.compensate me for the 5.99 i paid for the movie i could not watch. Same thing happened to my daughter one week earlker, i am done trying to stream movies from amazon...have no problems streaming from other services like netflix

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I haven't been able to put this series down. I'm not much of a reader but I've absolutely fallen in love with this series. The writing is fantastic and, just when you think you can guess what will happen next, the author turns the story upside-down!
B00000JGHL|5.0|This movie is excellent.  It holds up well and the acting is of course great.  Can't say more - done
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This CD is so Great!  Before getting it, I only knew two of their popular songs, &#34;We Are Young&#34; and &#34;Some Nights&#34;. I was worried about not liking others, but decided to go for it anyway.<br />In the beginning, some of the individual songs seemed a bit odd, but when taken together as a whole cd, it had quite a nice effect. My boyfriend and I began to play it all the time in the car...and it got addicting! Sometimes I skip to a particular song, or play 'Some Nights' on repeat (It will take a looooong time for me to get tired of that song!) but more often than not I just start at the beginning and play it all the way to the end. The songs flow together well and develop from beginning to end; it's just very well put together.

B005K17RU0|2.0|The stars have it. I don't like it. It was all I used, but, no longer. Both my wife and I no longer use AccuWeather from Amazon. The app went over the top for me.  I'm not a professional weather person. Too much information and info split in pages on Kindle, no not easy to use and OVERWHELMING.  Hey, what's the temp, what's the day going to be like, and the same for the next few days, that is all I need.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  Chris told it like it was.  It didn't take long to read it was so interesting.  I gave it 5 stars because I don't read a book very fast, and when I do it keeps my attention all the time.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Great Grreat app I can play any!!! RTS in a window even StarCraft II no slow down what so ever it really is a great app no BS !
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book certainly makes you think and is enjoyable to read.  It can open up a new way of evaluating how we look at successful people and how opportunity and circumstances shape our own lives.  While some may argue that the book leaves success up to chance, I believe the author shows that it takes the combination of giftedness, work ethic, and the ability to take advantage of unique and incredible opportunities to be successful.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Let me start off by saying WOW. My husband and I sat throught almost half of the movie until we turned it off. Did the writers run out of words to use or do they just like the F word?? I understand that some movies have language but seriously?? Every other word seemed like the F word and to me it was used excessively and in places it shouldnt/didn't even needed to be used! For us to turn off a movie takes alot and my husband shouted \\"ENOUGH\\" and we turned it. I can't believe how many times they used it. Disgusting and I felt defiled after watching. DO NOT WATCH !!!!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|UPDATED INFO: This review is for an older edition of the product.  Anker has a bad habit of re-using old product entries when they upgrade their product.  The new product is 24W, the old one was 18W.  The new allows either Android or Apple in either port, the old one was one port dedicated for each.  So, assuming the new one delivers on the specs (which I suspect is true, but since I don't own it I can't confirm), it looks to be an improvement, solving my largest complaint.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:  There is a lot to like about this charger. 1st and foremost, it is amongst those few chargers that both clearly indicate what types of devices it will charge and supports the vast majority of both Apple and Android devices.  This is a lot more rare than many realize, as it is impossible, without some sort of switch/configuration, to have one port on a charger that supports both Apple products and Android products.    This charger goes the route that a few others have and allocates one port to Apple products and one to Android.  This is great for flexibility, and while when the idea was first introduced I thought it was a great solution, over time I've grown somewhat disappointed with it.  My family, like most families, have settled into being a one-OS family (Android in our case).  So what good does that 2nd port, which only supports Apple, do if all my devices are Android?    Yes, I know that I can use special \\"charging cables\\" to make ports designed for Apple products work well with Android devices, but personally I find that a weak solution.  It means I have to carry two different types of cables on a trip, one for an actual USB connection to a PC and one for charging.  I'd rather not have to do that.    This charger also has another new feature, one that I've only seen on one other charger, the PowerGen 15W charger.  Most multi-port chargers, even those who support different devices on different ports, use one voltage converter to power all the ports (called \\"bridged\\" from this point forward).  The downside of a bridged solution is that if one device pulls too much power, the other device suffers.  This device has two entirely independent converters, so if one device pulls a lot, it will have no effect on the others.  Kudos to Anker for taking the lead on that.    The downside for this device is that both ports do not have the 2.1 amps of current I would like to see, that the most power hungry devices require.  The Apple port is spec'ed to 2.1 amps, but the Android port is only spec'ed to 1.5 amps.  This means that people with 10\\" Android tablets won't be pulling the full power they could, even if the other device is only an iPod.  The bridged products don't suffer similarly.  However, it is worth noting that this device is better than the one other device that has it, which only has two 1.5 amp ports.    As for whether this delivers on its specs, my power draw testing passed with flying colors.  The USB spec is that the voltage shouldn't dip below 4.75 volts.  The 2.1 amp port was at 4.81 volts when I was pulling nearly 2.2 amps. The 1.5 amp port held at 4.90 volts even when I pushed beyond 1.6 amps.  This makes this the best performing charger I've tested.  As an added bonus, when I did push the unit significantly beyond it's amperage specs, the ports went into auto-shutoff preventing damage to the device, yet another positive for this device.    I had two minor dislikes for me personally:  It doesn't support the HP Touchpad (I recognize few of you will care) and it doesn't have a power LED.  I know some will like that, as they don't like the distracting light, particularly at night.  For me however, I prefer a light (not too bright of course) so that I know the device is working (or at least claims to be).    Overall, for people with an iPad and an Android phone, or an iPhone and a 7\\" Android tablet, or a her iPhone and his Android phone, or an iPhone and a lower power device (less than 0.5 amps) or is willing to buy a \\"chargingcable\\" I think you'll be happy with the device.  Not only does it deliver a lot of current, its good construction and compact size also are positives on its side that you'll like.    For me personally, this will replace my 15W bridged device from PowerGen for when I have one Apple and one Android device, but I'll keep using the 10W bridged device from Bracketron for when I've got two Android devices or am lugging around my HP touchpad.    For device manufacturers, if you want my coveted 5-star rating, this is what you have to do:  1. Deliver 2.1 amps to both ports  2. Make each device configurable (a small switch, etc.) to be either Android or Apple  3. Have good ergonomics/quality/compact size like this Anker  4. Support the HP Touchpad (OK, you don't really have to do that, but I'd really appreciate it anyway)    Notes on the devices I tested with:  -HTC Evo 4G LTE - showed \\"AC charging\\"  -Kyocera Rise - showed \\"AC charging\\"  -LG Optimus S - showed \\"AC charging\\"  -4th gen iPod Touch - charged correctly  -HP Touchpad - didn't charge correctly  -Breadboard with cut cables, power resistors and a fluke DVM used for power draw/voltage tests    Full disclosure: Anker shipped/gave me this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback.
B008NR91DO|5.0|If you like Jimi and/or you like Gary you MUST get this one. Unfortunately when Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox join him on stage it loses some steam but it's for three songs and then Gary's band comes back and it full speed ahead again. All in all it's the best money I've spent on a DVD in quite some time. I even bought another one as a gift and had Amazon deliver it. All worked out great!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Can't wait 4 years that's way too long and I can't retread everything but a decent ending. The series cannot go on forever
0062101897|5.0|It's hard to find something to dislike about this book. Its very informative on an educational stand point (if you are wanting to learn about Harry Potter). It's size is great and the pages are very glossary and has a lot of artwork and pictures I have never seen before. I have googled Harry Potter a lot for screen still and this book has a lot of never before seen. It's heavy and makes you feel completely great about spending the money on it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The examples and stories really help demonstrate what the author is trying to get across. You feel empowered after reading and understanding how habits shape our perceptions of the world around us. Highly recommend!
1932100660|5.0|This is a necessary read for all Americans.  The research behind the findings of this book (that a plant-based diet contributes to long-term health and that a diet based on animal products is a breeding ground for disease and disability) will change how you think about food and what you decide to eat.  A must read.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|In there third installment these guys keep pushing the limits of there sound as they build on there connection. heres hoping they continue making music for years to come.
B0000542D2|5.0|What more needs to be said?  It's the Beatles at their freshest.  The soundtrack is great.  It's in black and white.<br /><br />They were the best and here's why.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|from the great Joe Bonnamessa comes a once in a life time performance. with his great guitar and the unique acompony men this is not one to be missed.
1401923127|5.0|I bought this after hearing Wayne Dyer cite it in a lecture.  It correlates with Deepak Chopra's and Bernie Siegel's writing that our thoughts affect our health, and provides research-based evidence to support it.  A must read for people considering a holistic approach to health at all levels.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I have always been a fan of Boz Scaggs.  I saw him last summer with the Dukes of September and thoroughly enjoyed the concert.  Nice mix of original songs and covers on this CD.  Boz fans won't be disappointed.
B0090SI460|5.0|First, this isn't really my opinion of the movie.  It's great and I still love it, and so does my son (for whom I bought it for).  Second, I got this as a buy one, get the second movie for less kind of package deal, so that was awesome.  3D, Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy for about $20.  Don't really see that pricing anymore.  It was, at the time, a great deal and this is something my kid(s) will love for years to come.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is fantastic and should be read by everyone. The story gets into so much detail makes you see everything pi saw. A truly incredible story.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Good account of the events that occurred. Gives good insight to military operations and the planning that goes into them. It also let you know the training involved in these elite forces.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Another must read for all Americans.  Seems to be an untainted-by-politics account of this mission. Much better than Zero Dark Thirty.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|The songs are great and it takes you back to the theater when each of them play...so happy I got it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Every American should read this account to understand what is required of the military and how little their sacrifice is appreciated.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I LOVE this movie and John Travolta is the bomb!! I loved the original movie and this one is just as good, if not better!!! If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is so great and I love it. I would recommend it to any person that wanted a great mystery game that doesn't have ads and force closes.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|When I teach students &#34;author's purpose,&#34; I teach 3 key purposes: Persuade, Inform, Entertain. Max Brooks may have been doing all 3 in this book, but I walked away more entertained than anything else. The vignettes, as some have pointed out, left me wanting more closure. The political statements are sometimes too overt, and the writer's failure to add authentic language (dialect) to the various characters is also disappointing. Still, it's an entertaining read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have played at least a hundred video games and this is pretty good. The graphic quality is pretty decent. This game is awesome when you get down detail. I would totally rate this a five because you never want to put it down once your being chased by a giant monkey. This game flushes minecraft pocket edition and angry birds down the drain.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoy Ms. Flynn's style of writing. The story held my interest, but was disappointed with how the story ended.
B00338QENI|5.0|I really liked the storyline of the family however the ending should have been at the beginning; with a detail of content.  I felt that the ending was flat.  Rebecca did a fabulous justice to the Lacks family by writing this book!
B007D5E7C2|4.0|this convoluted movie  is not unlike  david lynch's movies.<br />that said,I'd rather take a plot twisting movie from lynch any day<br /><br />Oh,by the way,product arrived quickly and in the condition described
0307346617|5.0|BOUGHT IT FOR MY WIFE WHO IS INTO WALKING DEAD, SAID IT STARTED SLOW  THEN SHE COULDNT PUT IT DOWN
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It works really well I have all the zip codes of areas that I like to keep track of.  I have this on my home computor and Blackberry as well.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gillian Flynn is definitively a breath of fresh air. Even though I am not totally satisfied with the ending, I have given it five stars because of her likeable lingo, her great storybuilding and highly believable characters (sic! - you need to read to the book to understand that reference...).
B00632HWOG|4.0|It works really well when its signed in.  But when it gets signed out it takes me several tries to get it signed back in.  I dont know why but eventually it excepts the password and works perfect after that.
1610454812|5.0|After listening to the audio version of fearless, it makes me appreciate my life just a little bit more. Who would ever think that a drug using man could turn into one of the men that helped fight the war on terrorism. This book was well written in bring the reader into the life of Adam Brown. When he found his direction, even though he had many hurdles to get to where he wanted to be he found a way to over come them.  The proverbial, &#34;when life knocks you down&#34;, theme is in the book many times, but, life is never an easy walk and the book is inspiring. This book made me think of every man and woman has sacraficed to help defend our freedom from terrorism, bless all men and women that are serving our country.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So far its working well and lets me keep up with my family and freinds also my favorite organizations. thanks
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|the book seemed pointless and random.  Having trouble reading any more of it.  I thought it would be more the way she talks but I find it roaming aimlessly.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I love this album!<br />It's quite extensive and I can listent o it in the car, at work or when I am studying.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This is a good app for someone looking to start an exercise routine.  I wanted to incorporate exercise into my weight loss regime and this app starts with a few seconds of showing the user how to do the exercise or movement before the countdown starts. I like that I can choose how many minutes of workout time I want to do and I like the various options for exercise.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|BOTH GIRLS LOVED RACEN THE CARS THEY DID NOT WANT TO STOP  PLAYN THE GAME THEY LAUGHED N JUMPED UP N DOWN
0802473156|5.0|After reading this book and identifying my own love language and what I think was probably my late husbands, I was able to understand why our relationship worked the way that it did.  You can apply the insight of the five love languages to any relationship, whether they are friends or family members.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A fascinating story of human relationships in the stressful years dominated by World War II and it's impact on London. A daughter eventually understands the cicumstances of a murder by her mother which she witnessed<br />in her youth and kept secret well into adulthood. A very good read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This site gives me just the right amount of weather information to plan the day or week.  It is easy to read and concise.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  The subject matter isn't one I read much about and I was skeptical that an entire book could be kept interesting on the subject of hiking a very, very long trail.  It did prove to drag on in parts, but the author did a good job of keeping the story going with her personal memories, thoughts toward her future and her interactions with fellow hikers along the way.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|As is expected from Leonard Cohen, the lyrics of the songs are powerful poetry and the more that I listen to the CD the more that I love it.
B004I744AS|5.0|When you type in a word it has a little sound box to help you sound it out. It helps me a lot
B00005KFU0|4.0|Great deal and price. Couldn't have found this in the store, or for the price purchased for that matter. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware that it's a &#34;Region 2&#34; DVD (UK compatible only); and therefore not compatible with U.S. DVD players. Shipping was reasonable and only a minor time lag.<br /><br />However, I do love the cover with Kate Hudson's scantily clad, sexy pose. Otherwise, what else can I say on that aspect?  Thank you!<br /><br />Would you, by chance, have a &#34;Region 1&#34; (U.S. compatible) &#34;Almost Famous&#34; DVD at a discount price as a consolation? Look forward to your response.<br /><br />Thank you.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|In the pantheon of misunderstanding and hyperbole that is special operations military life, Owens a Maurer do an excellent job of helping the reader (albeit one without any former military experience or exposure) understand the reality of serving one's country in the most dangerous deployments possible.  It is no small balancing act as Owen's describes, to keep everything in check...keeping the scale from tipping too far in a single direction.  Made even more complicated by a scale with multiple areas to measure; military life, home life, public, private, and confidential.  Readable and understandable for military neophytes.  Tells the story without glorifying any one group including the SEALs, but helps the reader appreciate how lucky we are to have the men and women of the armed services, who put their lives on the line every day.
B009FZFONO|5.0|ok so most zombie movies are pretty basic...the world has gone to hell and you need to kill the dead to survive...yatta yatta yatta.<br /><br />wife doesn't sit down very often to watch a good movie. put it this way...if i said to her in a deep voice &#34;...Luke I AM YOUR FATHER...! she would just walk away with puzzled look and not realize the star wars reference. and personally i have all but written off network tv. BUT THIS SHOW? has brought me to who??? AMC? wow? no not HBO...not CINEMAX... not SHOWTIME.! but of all the networks....AMC. the story lines are great that's all i can say. watch and enjoy.
B004TRBFVS|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable recording.  Maggie Gyllenhaal has the perfect voice for this reading.  I enjoyed this audiobook so much that I bought the printed book and the &#34;Cliffs Notes&#34;.  Truly an important American classic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have over 15 translations of the Scripture and this is the easiest to use and read. Switching between Bible translation is a quick process and the cost cannot be surpassed. Use it whenever you have a few moments and find yourself growing in the faith.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|&#34;Firefly&#34; is one of the better television science fiction series in recent years. If you want to go back and catch all the episodes (as I did) or simply have your own DVD's of the entire show, this is the way to go!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just amazing in my opinion. I love how it's written. At times I felt as confused as Katniss. Love this series, wish it didn't have to end. I love how it makes you think about where we are headed.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Enjoy it with my kids, but is not as good as other cartoons that out there, enjoy it but not will rented again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it better than the first one. bigger monster too. awesome game. cool. addicted to this game. getting in trouble playing it all the time. lol
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I looked at many different kindle fire covers before choosing the MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware.  I was hoping I chose the right one as it can be difficult with all the covers on the market and various reviews.  The case is sturdy, the device snapped into the case without a hitch, the power button for the devise is still readily available.  The stand actually works.  It seems like it wouldn't but it does!  I even have it propped up in bed on my mattress watching netflix with no problem.  There is an outside elastic strap that hold the case shut.  This also works fine and keeps the cover tightly closed.  I would highly recommend this case to anyone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I loved Quell, so got this one too, and am not disappointed.  One reason I put several games on my Kindle was that we don't have WiFi at home and it will give me something to pass the time there, or while waiting for appointments, on long car trips, etc.  However, I discovered, that without a regular WiFi fix, the Kindle will not let you play this and most of my other games! I went to a coffee shop, used WiFi for 5 minutes, and then all of my games were able to resume, at home with no WiFi.  I guess I was using WiFi often enough in the first month that I didn't notice that this requirement. I have no idea how often you need to do this, but I think I went about 2 weeks with no WiFi before it refused to let me play the games.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|I kept waiting for something to happen but before I knew it the book was over. I loved hopeless but this book was a  major let down.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Arrived in time, good quality and very pleased. Would purchase more videos from this dealer and would recommend to others.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Subtitles are a little annoying for those of us that speak German, but otherwise this is a fantastic movie! They \\"cleaned up\\" the language a bit, but otherwise this is an outstanding representation of the less than glamorous submarine duty of the second world war. So many men lost their lives in those small ships trying to help their respective sides win the war, and in most cases bodies could not even be returned. I think this would be good for anyone that thinks war is some \\"adventure\\" to watch, it brings home just how horrible it really is.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I found it hard to believe that this was written so long ago, as never has being actively positive been more important than right now. This book should be required reading for every high school student.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST game ever!!!!!  It makes you smarter. I play it every day. I LOVE IT!!!!  Thank you MOJANG.  :)  YOUR the best.
1455523550|3.0|I haven't read many Nicholas Sparks books. Actually, I THINK I've only \\"read\\" two including this one. The other being The Lucky One. And both I've actually listened to the audiobooks, but I do love the movies based on his books. It's no surprise that this man is a gifted storyteller.<br /><br />That being said, Nicholas Sparks has developed a reputation for killing off at least one character in every book. And while death is most certainly a part of life and it's all around us, it lends to his predictability. Every Nicholas Sparks book or movie I begin immediately attempting to discover who's going to end up dead. He didn't disappoint in killing of a character or in his predictability.<br /><br />I did enjoy The Guardian, but I don't think one thing caught me by surprise. I'd email my sister, who I borrowed the audiobook from, and say \\"X is a creeper isn't he?\\" or \\"X is going to die, right?\\" She can attest. I do believe every single guess I had was correct.<br /><br />But the story was well-developed. The characters had a backstory and history. I can see this coming to the big screen and being a hit as Mr. Sparks other books have been.<br /><br />All in all, I found The Guardian to be predictable but a solid read worthy of a middle of the road rating of 3 stars. Have you read The Guardian? If so, what did you think? Let me know!<br /><br />More reviews at Somewhere Only We Know - [...]
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I downloaded this book on the advise of a friend that said I jsut had to read it.  It was compelling reading, especially since the auther is a neurosurgeon and he is telling of his own personal experience of his near death experience.  It was facscinating reading
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery meter app does everything you might want it to do. I especially like the fact that it loads automatically when you switch on while you have your Kindle charging.<br />Nick
B0015AARJI|4.0|i had an issue with my controller and got a refund. so i think its not so bad. only issue i had was that the triangle wasnt working at first but its doable and for the price its not a big deal.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Very very good indeed. Exceptional cinema photography. Great in 3D.  Brilliant story.  Well re amended to all age groups. Thanks
0141345659|5.0|A very well written and poignant book that I would recommend for everyone to read. It touched me in so many ways that surpised me pleasantly.
B0042816YK|5.0|I didn't read the book - I know many people love books more than movies, but I just saw the movie so I have no bias there.<br /><br />And despite all the rumors I heard about it being bad - I absolutely LOVED it!<br /><br />I think it showed a lot of guts and a woman searching for change and joy!<br /><br />The critic IMO are jealous and would never have the bravery to do something like this in their own lives so they can shut it!<br /><br />Every time I watch this movie I learn something new. It's beautiful.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|I good Bond movie for it's time period.  One of the better Bond's over all.  Good action scenes and good plot, and acting that is good.  (compared to many other Bonds)
0061122416|5.0|One of the BEST books I have ever read!<br /><br />Granted it took me a few chapters to get into it, but after that I was HOOKED and read the rest in about two days!<br /><br />I love the story - there are SO many deeply symbolic analogies and messages in this beautiful story!<br /><br />It's one I want to read every year!
B000FA675C|2.0|It is what friends had told me it was. Nothing I will finish reading or read again. Don't like it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I saw these guys live in UT a few years ago - and wow, they have come a long way.<br /><br />This album is genius. My favorite song is Radioactive! Love love love Imagine Dragons!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Les Miserables is my favorite show. I love what PBS did for its 25th anniversary. I have watched the program each time it is on TV and have always felt wonderful afterwards. When I saw this on Amazon I realized that I needed to have it so that I can watch it each time I need an uplift. At the end I feel so wonderful. This was a terrific buy.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I have this album on repeat.<br /><br />Ed is a very talented musician and his voice is like a massages for my ears ;)
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|What can I say.  One of the best movies I have seen in a few years.  Takes you inside Sound City looking at all angles - business side, musician side, and on a journey as times change (comsumer demands change) and technology evolves.  Play this one loud after a few beers.
B006UAWH2S|5.0|It's very different, but it's a very beautiful and touching film.<br />It really made me think about life and love and the things we take for granted.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|This is an amazing find for me since I was looking to deviate from my usual historical and contemporary romances. I love everything about this book and it is surprisingly well-written. I highly highly recommend it and the next book in the series is a definite must-have!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This author has a style of writing that can make anyone understand the principles of the quantum world.  I love her style of writing. I would  buy another one of her books.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I use to watch the Star Trek serious and I enjoyed watching them. I also enjoyed watching this movie. Would recommend this movie. Loved it.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I randomly picked this movie to watch the other day with little expectations. Turned out to be an amazing movie. I wonder if what that guy made is legal, but it was genius. I'm quite sure this was based in a true story. A warning: keep your full attention all the time, otherwise you'll be lost at some point. I really think the main character deserves other movies, but not &#34;The Lincoln Lawyer - Part II&#34; please. Congratulations to the elaborate editing work and, of course, to the whole cast.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I use to play a different version of this game on my office computor. Now I bought this version for my kindle and I love playing it all the time.
0812550706|5.0|This book was my gateway drug for Sci-fi and Fantasy.  I can still vividly remember how much it touched me when I first read it as a teen.  I cannot recommend it highly enough for new and old alike.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put The Hunger Games down.  This is an enthralling book that pulled me in immediately and never let go.  Based in the future after a war between the Capital and the 13 districts, the Capital after winning, controls the Districts with an iron hand.  The main character, Katniss Everdeen, is a tough girl of 17 that will win your heart.  After reading The Hunger Games, I quickly bought the second (Catching Fire) and third (The Mockingjay) books of the series.  I read all 3 in under a week.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|JUST AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS NOVELS IN THIS SAGA, THE STORY CONTINUES TO UNFOLD WITH UNEXPECTED TURNS AND OUTCOMES, RE-VISITED BY VILLAINS AND HEROES ALIKE.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|When I saw the previews for this movie I have to admit I wanted to buy it because it looked like it had a lot of action and suspense.<br /><br />It was a slow paced movie that was pretty weak on substance and plot.<br /><br />Good Acting and Scenery though.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|With all the pre-marketing, I thought more than one track would have made it all worthwhile. A real disappointment. Sorry.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book and its message.  First off, let me tell you I am an evangelical reformed Christian and nothing in this book challenged or changed what I believe.  What this book has done is confirmed my belief in God, eternal life and the enormity of who God is.  Did this book explain everything you need to understand about heaven or he'll...no.  I don't think it needed too.  Just the confirmation we are spiritual beings in a physical body was enough. Read the book. Then read the Bible.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story line is interesting and the characters are well developed.  I enjoyed the story and it is an easy read.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Why did they not make this a movie? It is the perfect Hollywood set up. There's drama, adventure, trekking through jungles, spoiled rich kids, great ending, and even a \\"spiritual\\" aspect. I was glued to this book.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Definitely a very good book but it didn't get a little confusing in some parts.  Really good writing and compelling story
B003B02PF4|4.0|This is one of Grisham's best. It was fun and adventuresome. It reminded me of Daniel Silva and Gabriel Allon. It was suspenseful and definitely gets you to think about what kind of crap we swallow as truth from the media. Loved it!
B00947N6D8|5.0|I LOVED this movie when I took my 10 year old son to the theater to see and LOVE that I can now watch it anytime I want to.  I also bought this movie for my 4 year old grandson and he LOVES it too!!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|Be prepared to loose sleep.  Fast paced historical fiction with cover to cover thrill.  Could not put it down once I picked it up.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|So much wasted potential with this story, especially the last novel.  It could have been filled with her personal growth and accumulation of responsibility, and its pages could have been riddled with interesting tangents on the inherently well conceived back story. But instead we're left with a self absorbed, strong young woman who when faced with adversity collapses instead. The cliche boot camp section doesn't count. What a waste in the end.
030758836X|3.0|I usually read everything that Entertainment Weekly recommends. Especially if they're in the bullseye. And I really had high hopes for this book. I wanted to love it. I just didn't. It was alright. The characters were alright. The crazy storyline was alright. The writing was good, but the rest....alright.
B004RC8NUQ|3.0|This movie was ok but it was just a little to silly for us older adult. but  the younger  adults would like it.
1616550414|4.0|This book is very interesting and it covers the first twenty-five years of The Legend of Zelda universe. I hope to see another 25+ years of this company to find out more of the story.
B00A0R02HO|2.0|The movie was ok but not up to the quality of the orignal movie as far as  the acting and story goes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use and has large, easy to read numerals. I highly recommend this app if you are in need of a calculator.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Hooked on the books and the television series. I will be ordering the next few books and can't wait for the others to come out. I have it on Kindle.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Sounds great when it it keeps a connection.  Allot of times I get the dreaded beep beep and it looses connection while I am sitting at my desk not 2 feet from the dongle.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Convient. No deck of cards to fool with.  Do not win often but cute animations<br />When I do. Can be fun..
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read almaost all of Dan Browns books. Packed full of adventure and interesting discrption. His books are always well researched
B007DIQC90|5.0|We really love Of Monsters and Men. They have great style and a laid back feel that we love to turn up!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I kept playing this game over and over.  I have not found a way to get out of the first world.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|We randomly bought this cd because we liked Of Monsters and Men and we heard it was similar. It has quickly become our FAVORITE!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a really entertaining time killer. Story line is actually better than I expected it to be.And games can be saved for different players.
B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|I'm not too familiar with all of the songs by this group. There are some that I like, but as with many other cd's I'm not<br />familiar with all. So, I play the favorites over and over.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|The cabin fever book is awesome  I like when  Christmas hit and Santa's scout he was so creepy how he looked. And I liked when Gregory had to shovel the snow and he used a hose and the drive way was covers in ice. And another part of the book that I liked was when they had a huge snow storm and they where trapped by snow then they lost power but actually Manny pulled the electricity switch and the only place in the house that had electricity was Manny 's room. So very good work on the book I am impressed by your skills I hope you make a number 8,9,10,11,12,13 and more good by!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002I97|5.0|It's a pleasure to seat for hours and play Jhon Prine with all my friends. We can go back and remenis the old day's
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I was astounded as I started drawing right off with Drawing Pad. I was laughing like a kid, I was playing. Once I started using a good sylus it helped even more, but this was a basic artistic expression such as I have not had in a long time.<br />Of course there are always more things we will want in tweaking for our best usage.  I wished for a selection of fonts for example, and color changing .how about creation of greeting or business cards, and insertion of photos?<br />I still give it four stars because it let me explore my artistic side. Thanks to the Drawing Pad developers.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Firstly I am a great fan of Ken Follett, his books always are exciting World Without End is a fabulous sequel to Pillars of the Earth.<br />More British historical fiction from KF please.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The story was told in a fabulous way.  It went to from a fantasy to a true life story with a change without compromising the beauty of it.  The CGI was seamless.  A good story for the whole family.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is totally awsome you just got to get this app it is fun and keeps you on your toes and makes you keep playing
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is really likeable. As this happens to me I'll get a new app play it for awhile and then forget about it. It is a fun app but gets boring after awhile but it's still awesome!!!!!!!
B009PHRIEA|3.0|Doubtful that too many people are coming to this release as Cobham novices. Therefore, for most, the big question might relate to the sound quality and if any re-mastering has been done, or if any extras are included. Due to another review I optimistically thought that some of this might be true, and that these discs would represent an improvement over the older copies of these releases already available on cd. They don't.<br />The sound is identical, and possibly inferior, to the versions of these albums on Wounded Bird and Atlantic. There are also no extra or bonus tracks. The packaging is as basic as it comes. No personnel or recording info. No booklet with liner notes or career overview. Just the discs in basic and flimsy versions of the original album covers. Compared to this, boxes like the Weather Report or Brecker Brothers sets are vastly superior in just about all of the ways someone looking for a better version of an older disc would be happy about.<br />Having said all of this, the music is good, and Billy did some nice things in the 70's. If you have little or none of it on cd, and can't find the Wounded Bird discs, here's a cheap way to get his first 5 post-Mahavishnu albums. You'll be scratching your head about who the bassist is, when the recording was made, or if Billy wrote his own compositions (he did). They could've done a much better job with this, and I've learned an important lesson that will make me stay away from any of the other Original Album Series releases.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|So easy, lost about 1 to 1 1/2 lbs a week.  First time I was a little hungry between meals.  But got over it. In a month I've lost 6 1/2 lbs.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable works as advertised. My Nexus 10 charges faster with this cable than the USB. I've been concerned about plugged things into the USB too many times to the point of wearing out the socket or breaking it.<br /><br />In an hour, my charge indicator went from 51% to 74%. That's how fast the POGO connector charges.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Ordered on Sunday and received it on Wednesday. This POGO should have come with the Nexus as OEM cable.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I got sucked in by another app's promises....and then found this one.<br />It is easy to crop your pictures, and that is what I really wanted it for.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Sloan weaves a great tale of magic between the lines.  An epic combination of dusty book stores, Google, the internet, dungeons and dragons, secret societies and an unsolvable mystery.  Great characters and a fantastic imagined world.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|This is one excellent piece of hardware. I was seeking relief from wrist fatigue while mousing, and this little guy was my answer; let me tell you my set up.<br /><br />I've got it on the floor underneath the ball of my foot. Using the software, I've configured it to emulate a mouse left click whenever I rest the weight of my foot on it (By using a 'long click' action, but shortening the length of time it takes to activate it so it's instantaneous). This way my foot can rest on it, and when I need to click, I just lift my foot for a second, and set it back down again.<br /><br />I'm a full time programer, and I've had it for about 4 months now under my foot. It's still going strong. I found that mouse clicking was the source of most of my wrist fatigue. I still have to use the mouse to click if I want to CtrlClick, ShftClick, Click&Drag, or RightClick (which is my only complaint).<br /><br />It works fine with my Windows 7 machine, and I also found it works with 'Synergy' and 'Mouse with Borders' (after some fiddling) just fine.<br /><br />It's beautiful, sturdy, heavy, and durable. I would buy it all over again, and certainly will if this one ever breaks under the weight of my foot.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the Racketeer.  Grisham is so good at character development and story twists.  Will keep you guessing until the end.  Not his best work but by far not his worst.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I've read several paleo books and this one is by far the best! I haven't started my whole 30 yet, but I will very soon.
B009H442DG|5.0|this was a very fun cd that we were not quite sure how we would like it the quality was good
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  If you're looking for a nice love story, you should read this. I'm looking forward to seeing the movie.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|Looks like a lovely period video but ... when trying to play with subtitles on our DVD player, the subtitles in English refused to appear. When borrowed to a friend, the subtitles magically played. This DVD disk appears to be &#34;player sensitive&#34; for some machines and not for others. Unless you understand German, this might not be for you.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Recently saw this with the entire family.  I was surprised how my 7yr old followed the movie so closely.  Must have been the awesome cinematography and story line.
B000274THQ|5.0|Thanks to my professor who suggested this video as an accompaniment to our study in the course &#34;Radical Political Theory&#34;. Many moments of ironic humor and lovely demonstration how human will, compassion, and family does overcome no matter what the political environment in which we find ourselves in the past or today. Well worth sharing and watching again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. Very detailed. I could imagine myself as the character Katniss. Can't wait to read the other two books of this trilogy.
0061766089|1.0|I was fooled by the good reviews in the beginning, those must have been purposefully designed. In fact, one of the worst books I have read: just mentioning clients and their industries, never going into detail. It 's nothing but a long sales pitch for the author's company. Very disappointing.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Had a good few twists so that kept me interested. Some of the characters were a bit hard to believe in my opinion but its your typical Jodi Picoult style read. So if you like that then read this.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this type of game well enough but I don't like the &quot;lives&quot; aspect! They should just say at the begining, give us access to all of your info and all your friends too, and give us unlimited lives.
1455523542|5.0|I like the story line in this book.  It was hard for me to put it down, as I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Youtube is a known website as you know, but youtube did not release this app. ISNT THAT ODD? Kinda. Its really the only app that lets you download music SAFELY!<br />My opinion: I wouldnt really recomend this app to another person. APP ON KINDLE FIRE! Causes a virus<br />to Android Phone!!
B000FA675C|4.0|It kept me reading it,couldn't put it down;trying to figure out the clues. This book is a good read for anybody.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a blessing. Awesome app: )love it love it love it love it love it love it love it.<br />I'm not sure why you have to put so many words down before accepts your review?????
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|don't get it if you get easily addicted to games!  One negative - it seems to use the Kindle's battery very quickly and I am careful about that as the unit is still new.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It's a very addictive game. I have already spent several hours playing the game. I highly recommended this game for anyone!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|a very good calculator app.  Nice big letters.  Must for any Kindle owner as it gives your Kindle a little &#34;edge&#34;.
B001458MI2|5.0|I love Chistina Aguilera! And this album makes me think of her very first album! A must have! You'll love it too!
0062202081|5.0|Loved It!!Would buy again and recommend to friends and family. Great product and just what I needed at the right price.
B005UKJX4E|3.0|Having read a number of the reviews before and after viewing the film, I would just make a few comments that might add to the discussion. On the positive side, the cinematography was excellent in many respects, but more editing needed to be done to reduce the fatigue factor and make the apparent message more digestible. The more important aspect is the message itself.<br /><br />I take it that the opening portion of the film sets the message as fundamentally spiritual in nature. The opening statement contrasting Nature and Grace is the basic premise, but the film itself barely expands on that very interesting and intriguing statement. Since the cultural setting is Christianity one would think that an understanding of Nature and Grace from a biblical point of view might be helpful. Biblically speaking, the existence of God is said to be apprehended by the mind through the creation itself so as to leave man without excuse (that which has design must have a Designer). The natural world is powerful evidence of the existence of God. Romans 1:19-20. The film does a fair job of setting out the wonder of the natural world, but it clearly supports evolutionary theory which the atheists claim renders a creator unnecessary. The opening verse at the beginning of the film should give all atheists and evolutionary scientists pause as the verse from Job points out that no man was there to actually observe how the universe was created. Science is supposed to be based on careful observation and experimentation therefore science cannot get beyond speculation and story telling as regards the initial creation of the universe and life itself.<br /><br />But putting the evolution/creation debate aside, the definition of the word Nature is fairly close to the biblical view excepting that the biblical view takes Nature beyond simple moral terms. A person might by natural inclination and moral study develop what might be considered a gracious personality, but that is not biblical grace. Biblically speaking, because of the fall, man starts out as separated from God and thus subject to death. In fact man is, by nature \\"dead in trespasses and sins\\" Ephesians 2:1-3. Therefore he is a \\"child by nature\\" of the judgment of God. The \\"natural man\\" (unregenerate) cannot understand the revelation of God and he counts it as foolishness. 1 Corinthians 2:14. Finally, the natural world itself, as an effect of the fall, has been subjected to vanity Romans 8:19-21. We live in a fallen world and as a result we are subject to sin and death. Into this natural condition comes the real Grace of God.<br /><br />In the film grace is defined as unselfish, forgiving and loving. Perhaps this is a going to far in the interpretation of the film, but the father of the family seems to be connected with the films definition of nature and the mother with the films definition of grace. The children seem to be torn between the two. Coming to terms with death is of course a major theme as well. All this touches on biblical themes but falls far short. Real Grace is unknown to the natural man because it comes from God's revelation of Himself in Christ and can only be known through redemption. A contemplation of Ephesians 2:1-10 makes all this clear. The book of Romans is a systematic presentation of this Grace of God.  All of mankind has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Man being created in the image of God, he was to be a display of this glory of God, but sin has ruined man and rendered him incapable, in his natural state, of being a reflection of God's glory. God who is love as well as light seeks mans recovery through the \\"gospel of the grace of God.\\" His light exposes what we are as rebels and sinners, but His love brings in the way of recovery to Himself and the way into eternal life. The film depicts a kind of afterlife or heaven in a humanistic way but without the real Christian theme of redemption, reconciliation and resurrection to God. Perhaps the best thing about the film is that it might lead persons to reconsider the deeper message of the Bible. I hope this will add to the further discussion of the film.
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Loved It!!!Would buy again and recommend to friends and family. Great product and just what I needed at the right price.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Although I found the story a little slow to start, once I got past the first 50 or so pages, I was hooked. The story has so many twists and turns and surprises to keep you on your toes and looking forward to what's next. Overall, a really enjoyable reading experience.

B008133DO8|1.0|I have really enjoyed the series so far, I think it is well done! I like the modernization, but I could not in good conscience recommend it my friends. If I had a friend who was trying to overcome a porn addiction I would be very sorry I had encouraged this show,especially this episode, because it would likely lead back into addiction. I sure would not let my children watch. I won't even finish the series as much as I want to.....
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I took several students to see this movie as a reward for excellent behavior.  Very intense and they loved it!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love it I got it for the ds and I had to get it for the kindle fire and I love it so far
B007MU85D0|5.0|Amazing album. You can listen to it over and over and over again. Buy it. Enjoy it. My Head is An Animal
B008YKGQR4|1.0|The FB app that comes with the Kindle Fire is pretty good except you cant upload pictures thru it. I tried this one and all it is is a page that gives you a choice between the mobile app and full site page. It crashed my KF repeatedly so I uninstallex it within 30 mins or so of downloading it. Lame.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They are so good! They keep you on your toes and waiting for the next one! I'm so glad I can watch them on Amazon!!!
B00005M989|5.0|Prince cannot be compared to any other singing talent. His musicality is without flaws. His voice makes listening a pleasure.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I was looking for a cheap drink, keys and phone holder, and this did the trick. I wasn't blown away by it... it isn't a perfect glove fit on the stroller, it doesn't have an internal gyroscope or anything like that... but it's fine, holds drinks, holds my keys, holds my phone, and cost very little.
B000050HTO|5.0|Dylan was a great song writer, who performed his own music in his own iconic, surreal fashion to the delight of many generations of listeners.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Starts out great, then kinda falters in the middle as they work thru the issues at hand. then it comes back with in your face WTF comedy and Totally redeems itself. Was worth watching once but not a true classic like knocked up.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|Some of the best, most iconic songs that ever rocked he world. Every song is a sing-along tune of memories.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I knew it could not be up to the Austen standard but was intrigued.  Was OK but felt it was unfinished, to many loose ends.
B00006AG5N|5.0|These are his great hits in one place. Whether he was singing gospel, rock-and-roll, or ballads...he always sounded great on his albums.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|old school western Action with hard realness but with break of Funny. Keep you watching for the next scene a true movie library must have.
B000I62JAK|4.0|What else is there to say? If you like Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson, watch this movie. Its fun, and silly and makes fun of the whole 'Male Model' profession, but is not mean about it. Ben's dad plays an important role it it too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THE IDEA OF HOW THE CHARACTER IS NOT A BAD PERSON AND HOW THE WORLD TOUR IS GOING ON I LOVE THE CHARACTERS THEY ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR OWN WAY I RATE IT 5 STARS KEEP THE WORLD TOURS COMING MAYBE NEW JERSEY NEXT THAT WOULD BE EXCITING!!!!!!!!!! This app is #1
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game. The hidden pictures are tough to find sometimes though. Hope you make more of these games available.
0307352145|5.0|I read about the book in a newspaper column here in Miami.  The book id better that I expected, very well reasearched.
B005HSL626|5.0|Game is fast paced and just fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes this kind of pace.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a very engaging story, cleverly woven in. The past and present.  The historical story of orphanages in Ireland was interesting and the darker side.  The story is engrossing and beautifully written.
0374533571|4.0|This was a pretty interesting book, it gave a different  kind of view point to mental heath issues. In a thought provoking and upbeat kind of way.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This has been such a pleasurable journey. All the late night readings past my bedtime were well worth many mornings of tired eyes!<br /> MeMe
1609611543|5.0|Ordered the book for Christmas gifs for those I love.  Husband's diabetic testing numbers have improved, and both of us have lost weight avoiding wheat products.  Gluten-free pasta and breads are available at most groceries and I'm lovin' it!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|if you like Quentin Tarantino, then you like all his movies.  This one is no different. fantastic.  Christoph Waltz is brilliant again, too.
1616550414|5.0|I love it! The shipping was fast and everything as expected, and the book was wonderful and the pice was not bad at all!<br />A must for all zelda fans out there!
B009L7MD44|4.0|So far I have used it only for transferring files to my iPads and iPod Touch devices but it works pretty well for that. My intention is to use it to share files with students immediately after taking video and/or photos of subjects of interest outside of a classroom setting.  That will allow us to acquire and share our digital videos/photos &#34;in the field&#34; without requiring us to have Wi-Fi access or returning to that classroom first.<br /><br />I really like the small form factor, it is convenient.  Using an accessory battery pack with the USB-based charging plug allows me to feel secure in terms of the device being available even if I forget to recharge its internal battery.
B0083I90HU|5.0|This was a story of a Jewish family and their nightmare with the forces of evil and Natzi hatred. It was a story of a family that brought you into their sorrow and their ability to overcome their struggles.  It kept me guessing all through the book about what had happened to her brother the night they came to take her family. It also gives us a picture into a world that we should never forget, because it could happen again, if we let hatred and racism be our over powering national,  mission. It was easy to read and very hard to put down until it was finished. It was realistic and told with the feeling that it was true.  The fact that it all happened in France is a surprise to many who did not know the history of the Natzi movement across Europe.  The facts of history are told in a book of fiction that makes you wonder about how man can do such horrific acts to other human beings.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works well with my Kindle.  I use it to charge my Kindle and to tranfer more books to my Kindle
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is awesome for traveling when outlets aren't in the right places. And, it makes it easier to use at home as well, for those times when you need/want to charge and read at the same time!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|My boys had this movie first on VHS, but wore the tape out, so I purchased a DVD copy for our collection. The movie arrived on time, and was in great shape upon arrival.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|As should be clear from other reviews, My Little Pony is a *Ville style game. The main activity is to grind at repetative tasks to earn coins, spend coins to buy items to complete &quot;quests&quot;, amass online friends to get special coins to buy special items and repeat. The main gameplay is actually coin management and shopping strategies, not anything to do with MLP. That said, if you're ok with the basic premise and daily (or several times a day) commitment to play the game needed to make progress, MLP does have a good variety of characters and items to collect as you build out Ponyville.<br /><br />There are two main issues:<br />1) The Kindle version is behind the iOS and general Aneroid versions. Basically the season updates aren't available (at least I haven't seen any since I started playing) and there are apparently versioning issues which prevent dropping of chests at online friends towns.<br />2) The gameplay feels unfairly balanced in favor of Gameloft. You're penalized for not playing online with friends by having to pay high value gems to skip send/receive gift quests. Some of the later characters to collect jump up significantly in value compared to earlier characters. If purchased directly with real money, the digital characters would be a couple times the price of the actual toys.  Parasprites and growing rocks and plants feel like they have no purpose other than to burn money and gems. It feels like Gameloft just wants to gouge players while only offering repetative gameplay.<br /><br />I you can get past these faults, MLP can be an enjoyable.way to past the time. Just set you expectations on online play and how fast or slow you may progress accordingly.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|You can't go wrong with the Ice Age movie series. This is just as funny as the original movie, and it is a great family movie!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|As a fantasy fan, I think this series is exciting - lots of action. Hopefully it will have many more seasons
B007XIO9TU|3.0|What Johnny does these days. Laid back and cool. Still a good sound. I just have to let go of the desire for his brightest, assertive tunes.
B0057UD49M|4.0|It's definitely not like the other comic books I've read, the use of imagery was for a good reason. The subject on homosexuality was a nice change of pace compared to the usual story line.
B004N868DS|1.0|We paid $40 for this mouse pad and the finish on it is already fading.  We have owned it for exactly 3 months and Amazon says its too late for a refund.  I will only buy mouse pads locally from now on.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Clearly written.  Good basic instruction that is straightforward and easy for follow.  It will be helpful now; however, I wish I had read it before I started uploading my novel.  I will use this information when I load my next book and will re-edit my current project so that it is much more comfortable for readers.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just love watching this show and the dvd has fun extras, including the gag reel which I always enjoy!  It's fun to see the mistakes behind the scenes.
1400067936|5.0|I heard all about Black Swan over the past couple of years but resisted reading it due to my dismissing as a piece of pop lit. After reading that all the great poker players had picked up Fooled by Randomness, I bought a copy myself quite cheaply through the amazon z shop. I am pleased that I did so. Nassim Taleb is not a journalist as much as he is a man of science. I enjoyed his review of the literature here, and I also appreciated the stories he conveyed as a trader in these pages. This book was written in 2004 so it does not address the concept of a \\"black swan robust society,\\" but after reading about it I've placed Black Swan on my wish list and will be reading that one as well. This is a book that challenges and educates.
1616550414|4.0|This book is a really great look at the whole Zelda series and feels like it was lovingly crafted as much as the games feel they were.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the content is very Skyward Sword heavy, devoting a huge portion of the book to that alone. It left me, as a non wii owner, a little meh at the overall value of the book when I was hoping for it being dedicated equally to all it's parts.<br /><br />That being said, if they had left out the skyward sword part, i would have still considered it an engrossing complete product.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|is a pretty entertaining game.  It is good to kill some time. You can do many stuff.  I love the game it. is cool.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|I tried this product with the impending demise of Google Reader. I hate it. For some reason, the developers think that a plane old scrolling list view is obsolete, i.e., I can't get the app to allow me to scroll through a simple list view of my feeds.
B002RXVOX0|4.0|Good movie but originally it was in full color.  This version has been re-colorized and looks more black & white than color.  Too bad.  It was really great in full color.
B009POCFTG|4.0|If you like dark movies then this movie is for you. Matthew McConaughey is like you've never seen him before. If you cant turn your eyes away from a car crash then you wont be able to turn your eyes away from this movie.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I'm am going to begin by saying that before this album came out I actually didn't like Paramore. I just looked at them as another alternative rock band, and that there wasn't anything special about them. Since the release of \\"Now\\" I can now say that I am a fan of them. I love the fact that there is not one set genre that the entire album can be put into, it doesn't sound like the same boring thing over, and over, and over again. It's probably because I'm a fan of a lot of different genres, but it in general is just a great album. And I notice a lot of people complaining about lyrical depth with this album... listening to \\"I'm not angry anymore\\" should give you the hint that this album wasn't going to be about pure hate, or tension. The band built a bridge and got over it. Meaning there isn't going to be another track that has an anger sound to it like \\"Ignorance\\" for quite sometime until the band fights with each other or Chad and Hayley split (neither or going to happen for probably a real long time). This album is lighter because, when you let something go that was holding you down that's just how you feel. And about the album sounding nothing like the old Paramore, you can still hear it in there I think you really can on \\"Still into you\\". They never were a hardcore rock band and have released songs that were more poppy then many of the songs on this album.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I read the first book and it was amazing, my only concern is for people who don't like drama or action along with death. If you read the book then expect all that I named above. Other than what I said I absolutely loved the book and can't wait to read the next.
B007JNWQZS|5.0|This without a dought one of the greatest movies of all time, why haven't you bought it yet. Hurry and get it.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  I loved the stories about the companies, the interesting scientific information about food industry, and food science.  It reads like a novel.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If you like Game of Thrones, then this is for sure worth adding to your collection. The DVD set arrived vary fast too :)
B000FC0V3E|1.0|Umm...you must be kidding. Mindless nonsense. This is the story of several, self absorbed drukards stumbling their way through a short season of life together; they are self indulged, lazy and broke. The book finally comes to a ridiculously predictable ending. Yes, of course there is symbolism throughout, but do not waste your time.

B004UPAIDK|4.0|Bruce Campbell is awesome since most of the 2nd movie he has no other interaction with another actor for quite some time. It is purely him reacting to the craziness around him and his expressive eyes certainly keep the viewer captivated and laughing at the same time. I had not watched this in over 10 years and was as much entertained as the first time.

B004HO6HWA|4.0|Mechanic is a great film and thanks to a good performance put on by Jason Statham I rate this 4 stars!
B00486U2VY|1.0|Really did not enjoy this book at all, not well written, does not hold attention lacks in suspense but most of the ending is tragically all about the author, rather than the story.  Do not read this book, find something better to do with your time.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. I have seen all 3 seasons in fact I pulled an all-nighter to watch Season 2. It was fun to get the UK version for I was ahead in the episodes while all my friends were waiting to see the &#34;final act.&#34;
B009D0LBRO|4.0|This is very well done, but It seems like there isn't very many levels.  Of course it's very cheap compared to a &#34;real&#34; video game, but there's probably only 30-40 minutes of game play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|LOVED IT! Watched it straight through - non stop. Hurry up Season 4. We should all support our local PBS so that we can continue to have this excellent programming.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Tarentino out did all previous efforts with this gem of a film.  To say it is a unique look at a subject that others will not touch simply does not go far enough.  The cinimatography is impeccable and the storyline will mesmerize...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I loved the entire series. I was disappointed in the ending though. It felt like it didn't end. Maybe book 6 is to follow.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app almost daily. It comes in handy to know the weather for the week or the day.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I Love this series, Game of Throne is the absolute best!<br />I watch the series and this gave me the opportunity to catch up on the details that I sometimes miss<br />Fantastic!!
0345803485|3.0|If I read the phrase \\"Oh My\\" one more time I think I would have puked in my \\"Rucksack\\" (whatever the hell that is.)<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because of the sex!  If you can overlook the bad writing, weird British phrases and limited vocabulary of the characters, read it---cause it's pretty darn hot.<br /><br />And men: if you are clueless about what women really want---here's an unabridged guidebook.
B0064MGU98|5.0|i love this show..written well, keeps me rivited week to week.  good characters, plots, and courtroom drams, love the atroy lines
1594487154|5.0|In Daniel H Pink's mind, we're all natural-born salespeople: each of us persuades other people to part with resources everyday.<br /><br />While we're all in sales, the game has changed - in favor of the buyers. The internet brings information into the buyers' hands and forces businesses to be transparent. Customers can see what your other customers have said about you before they ever speak with one of your staff.<br /><br />With this new reality in mind, Pink suggests three ways of being: attunement (find the best way to start a conversation), buoyancy (maintaining positivity) and clarity (help buyers be clear about the problem they want solved).<br /><br />Other writers such as Dan Kennedy in [[ASIN:1599183579 No B.S. Sales Success in The New Economy (NO BS)]] have pointed out that in the new economy, trust is the foundation of successful selling. Pink goes into the deeper reasons why the sales landscape has changed and what it now looks like.<br /><br />To Sell is Human will help you thrive in a marketplace where being is as important as doing. The book has enough practical tips to learn some new ways of doing, but the gold is in learning how to start conversations.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs, you're the best salesperson for your business. You want you to succeed. Use this book to sell more effectively.
B000WEMH3C|1.0|This grill cover is made of very thin plastic which easily tears.  Mine lasted just a few months before it got brittle and tore in several places.  I think a trash bag would have held up better.  Don't waste your money;  get a better quality cover unless you want to replace this every few months.
B00B4W8AIW|5.0|We live in an age where everyone has the struggle to bring something new, which is actually an omnipotent quest for anyone on any field of media, 'coz we have lived through almost everything, and experienced.<br /><br />However, KSE had brought us a really impressive content with massive dinamicy, which is reflecting life into our ears - there are bad time, yet there are magical, positive also - it's like this album has tracks with huge brutality, dark riffs, but always there is a classy Jesse Leach- like clean vocals and \\"Sissy-riffs\\" which reminds us 'don't worry man, everything is fine, there is always light at the end of the tunnel' (Times of Grace resemblance, even though there is no connection what so ever reffering to the bands interviews), but these guys have matured, and perfectly mixed all the memorable elements from previous albums, gave it some new ingredients, but with Jesse these elements are alive, it's so inspirational, it has a soul, and we can only be happy that our band is back.<br /><br /> Now this album drawes dinamyc diagram begining from 4 out of 5, uprisingly to the middle of the album, which represents the supernova top FIVE rating, and from there again to the lower ratings right to the end, it's like a perfect circle. Perfect, because it is a massive, good tracks included album with well crafted musical innovations, and varying riffs in every seconds. All Heil to KSE, they are good people, and of course welcome back Jesse Leach.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Having been a huge fan of the Burroughs John Carter Mars novels, I was anxious to see this film.  Although the film didn't impress me as much as the books originally did, this film is well done.  Acting, directing, plot and special effects all are tops.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I play pac-man on my Kindle using a stylus and it is so much fun...fun....fun....the sound effects also, are great, good job!!!!
B005M92MJ6|5.0|All the throb of Tool in an easy to listen too format.  Several good songs that I listen to over and over again.  For a real treat, if you have an iPhone, ask Siri to play &#34;Puscifer&#34;  she tries to say it but doesn't get it all the way right.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I have read the book and no other book could have come before this in my 'best books ever' list!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really have been enjoying this game! You can make it easier or harder to play depending on your mood and it doesn't take forever for the hint button to recharge. I recommend this game it's really fun and I will look for more from this group!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Again can not get it to work on my android tablet; but as I said I am not computer literate
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It's a Kindle book, so I can make the print as large as I want.  This makes it easier to read and I like how Sherlock solves mysteries.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|Not sure what all the excitement was all about.  I thought the film was just a less than average documentary and<br />not presented very well.  Why do we have to release all of our secrets?  Just doesn't seem like a good plan.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Just recently started watching Castle - now can not get enough! Season 5 is the best and love their characters and relationship as it's blossoming.
184448551X|5.0|it was everything and more than I expected. I am considering purchase of the remaining books in the series soon.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake is a great singer and I love this CD. He just gets better and better.  Can't wait to see what is next.
0385349947|4.0|This is a fine book for females or males interested in the female business view. I was expecting to get a feel for her role at Facebook and the company in general, and got very little. If you watch her TEDS speech it is a perfect outline of this book. The read is quick, I read it from cover to cover since she writes in a very fluid style.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love that I can check my Facebook anytime and it look like my desk top.  Wish it had a delete.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I have watched this movie twice now , once on the big screen and once on dvd! It is a fantastic story of life and a story put together in one great picture! The acting was very good and the tiger was amazing and quite funny and also quite scary in parts! 5 stars for this film!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I love this movie.  It goes up near the top of my favorites.  The characters are spot on & the storyline is superb .
B001BKTEZA|4.0|The best and worst of human nature. Loved the Joad family. The sufferings of the migrants sickens me..we still haven't learned to take care of each other.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I was looking for a game for my kindle based on slenderman, and this is the slendy game to get. He pops up randomly as you collect the pages you have to collect in order to beat the part of the game. I'm usually a pretty tough guy, but him poping upin front of me made me jump numerous times, yet I'm still going back for more. Such an awesome time waster. The sounds and some effects in the game also add to the jump out of your seat factor too. OVER ALL it's an awesome adrenaline rush game! :D
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I enjoy not being able to guess what is going to happen from week to week.
B0031RS69G|5.0|I have read countless Discworld novels that I felt I should start from the beginning. So worth it. Met the Luggage!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Too hard to scroll through and read new messages. Nice to have when checking Facebook away from home though. Just wish it were easier to navigate.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Owesome movie, can recomend it to watch if you like CdeS. The DVD and BD was bought as used but there were no signs of scratches on the disks at all.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Enjoyable but the images are difficult to see when comparing sets. I would like it if you could pick the images so that more familiar images could be used.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It's ok because it's a different dictionary I'll give it 2 $tars and it does help spelling out words for t<br />Kids like me
1444737112|5.0|This book is such an easy read. You get caught up in the relationship between the cat and his homeless owner. They have saved each other.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|It took me over 20 years to finally buy it.  Wish I did it sooner.  Love the entire album !!!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|It's small, stylish, and accurate, I got it to use it while working; I'm rough carpenter, so I put my hands in tight openings between rebar and wood, no to mention very phisical demanding proffesion, so I lost two watches a lot more expensive than this one, because I got them pinch In thigh spaces, couldn't get them out. This one small I can move my hand easier and safer. Bothom line I love it.
B004TRP97E|5.0|I have started to listen to audio books recently, especially while traveling in my car.  This is the best one by far.  It is a story of a kid growing up poor in the US and Ireland.  I am sure the read would be compelling, but to hear it read by the subject of the book, Frank McCourt is a wonder.  You can feel the hunger, the grime, the stench but also the love and pathos through his wonderful reading.  I am sure I would have liked the book, but not half as much as the audio version.  Do yourself and your heart a favor and buy this wonderful audio cd.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I listened to the buzz about this book and succumbed to the pressures of friends. I finally bought it when I learned it has made it into the English Departments of some colleges and after reading most of it I am surprised this poorly composed piece of trash has made it into classes--it, the book, has no business being compared to anythying related to Literature. I don't mean the naughty stuff contained in EVERY chapter, I  mean the lack of writing skills demonstrated by this author is nothing short of astounding. Absolute rubbish.....never made it to the end of the book let alone the SERIES. Don't waste your time if you are looking for a plot, deep characters or anything resembling taste or tact. BOMB!!
0385349831|2.0|Lots of these are available - a super wise central figure expounding truth about weighty events. A wisdom book.  Many wisdom books  are much better. Think about Zarathustra by Nietzsche, The Prophet by by Gibran, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam - all fairly more engaging and somewhat more coherent. But if you like the \\"set up\\" of the book, the questions and the thoughts of those facing horrendous tragedy, I'd suggest Stephen Mitchell's Bhagavad Gita. The ultimate dramatic setting is ever present through the narrative: Arjuna, driven to battle in a chariot driven by God himself. Arjuna rides between the opposing forces, and sees his friends and loved ones, all facing death. What is he to do? Pretty gripping. A better read. Yes, Coelho raises the issue of the role of historical record, contrasting it with the impact and importance of personal record. I mean, it explains why the historical backdrop is omitted and none of the text deals with the crusader rape of Jerusalem. But it just didn't grab me.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|In the style of Heinline and Asimov, this intelligent page turner kept me involved from beginning to end. The science is excellent, the human interest gripping and the humor delightful. I have only the highest respect and gratitude for the author.
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book so much I was sad when I got to the end. It is such a sweet, poignant story and the way it is written, in letters, was a stroke of literary genius. There are so many different characters and personalities, you just want to go there and meet them all.  Even the sad parts weren't so bad because the war was over and there was so much good that triumphed in the end. I hope the authors write another book like this one.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We ordered this movie as a pre-order. It arrived on time to my eager children waiting in the driveway for the UPS man to deliver it on a snow day. This is a beautiful movie. We have watched it over and over and will for years to come!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Enjoying this series so much. Kinda warm and fuzzy! Nice producing and detail. Plan to catch in its entirety.  If it's BBC you can count on quality!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Captures characters we can identify with oh so easily and written from the perspective of a novel. One of the easiest &#34;Agile&#34; books I have read and one I highly recommend. So many common sense tips and kernels of great information that can be put in practice anywhere- of course a lot comes back to the essential qualities of leadership. The book covers this off as well. How Leaders that don't lead can take companies down very quickly.<br />Loved it and want more
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|(Janet Garrard-Willis, not David)<br />I happily nabbed a huge box of these at Goodwill, where they sat forlorn like cast-off plywood. For a measly $3 I have one of the most enjoyable toys I've ever purchased for our son. They await his birthday in hidden silence, but while he's at school,I sometimes ditch my home office and play. They appeal to the educational, creative, and fantasy-building needs of anyone, not just kids. Plus, Kaplas are far more aesthetically pleasing than loud, battery-powered plastic toys which entertain but ask for no input from the children. For me, the best aspect of Kaplas lies in their ability to cross generational boundaries and allow both caregiver and child an engaging and intellectually challenging way to carry imagination into the physical world---something often NOT done by trendy toys dated by the fickle toy market. How refreshing to play with kiddos and actually enjoy not only the child's company and affection, but the the toys themselves! I'll willingly play Catwoman . . . but I'd rather build her a Kapla block mansion or a super cool jet to evade my 5-year old Batman and *then* generate a plot--no doubt knocking the structure but not its durable components to smithereens in the process. Kaplas can adapt to most indoor imaginative play, can be passed between generations, and require no batteries other than the super-charged energy of the recipient. Best three bucks I ever spent, but also easily worth the asking price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator.  Simple to use and easy to read.  This is nothing fancy, but that's the beauty of it.  I love it.
B00653FC2W|5.0|Just as expected.  Once again Amazon does not fail.  Another great book for my collection and a great experience.  Thanks, as always!
0375869026|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from my kids' school librarian.  She knows I enjoy a good read, no matter what the target age range.<br /><br />I was in a fire when I was a baby and have had some plastic surgery.  I have scars that blend into my laugh lines, but I also have a medium size scar on my forehead.  Until I read this book, I have always worn bangs to cover the scar on my forehead - for almost 48 years!  I feel liberated!<br /><br />This book made me realize that I have nothing to be ashamed of and to wear my scar proudly to show I am a survivor!<br /><br />Thank you!
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Each piece of the puzzle seemed to drag on too long.  I was hard to hold my interest.  When everything finally came together is when it actually became good.  Bought this from the previews which, of course, made this seem very interesting.
B002DELX5W|1.0|So sad and bummed I ordered this movie for my sons birthday day. We ordered one other movie Gnomeo & Juliet and it was awesome another favorite movie of his it worked fine. This movie was bad or damaged as it didnt work in either of our dvd players and it broke my sons heart :(
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I've read a lot of Stephen King's books, but this is my favorite. It's kind of an end-of-the-civilized-world story. It could never be made into a movie like a lot of his books because it exploits children. I'm always disappointed with the endings of Mr King's stories, and this book is no exception. Still a great story and will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B005IQZB14|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the book.  This young lady took some significant risks and was often aided<br />by complete strangers.  It makes you feel better about our society.
B00138J342|5.0|This is probably Pearl Jam's best overall album. There are no lame ducks on this one!<br />Hard-driving rock and roll.
B001NLL8LA|1.0|This is my second and last Jack Reacher. \\"Worth Dying For\\" was tolerable, though it was clear Mr. Child had a New Yorker's view of Nebraska - uninhabited. In this book, set firmly on the sidewalks of New York, at least 20 bodies pile up as Jack stitches them with bullets, all, presumably, to prevent an old photo of Osama Bin Laden from embarrassing a congressman. We never know for sure. It is clearly written for 14-year-old boys and Tom Cruise.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|purchased this case for my 8 year old, and it definitely holds up to the beating of an 8 year old. very trendy and not pricey. She loves it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is fun, but I can't find a &#34;Save&#34; for what I have done and have to start all over when I open it up...that is a bummer..
B0095P31L6|5.0|good for kids young and old.  geat animation tuches on true events.  so good I watched it twice.  Even my wife liked it.
076115728X|5.0|I have always been enamored with interactive books with their hands-on page activities, and this book doesn't disappoint.  My only regret is that is isn't long enough, but that is inherent with this type of book, due to the thickness and quality of the product.  It has inspired me to work on my own version of interactive book.  Thanks, Mr. Saltzberg!!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I check it every morning. Has all the information and maps on everything to do with weather and the day.
B0000CFW87|5.0|i love it, the music is a mixture, some of the songs are relaxing, where others are much more upbeat. love to listen to it while i'm cleaning house.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|An emotional story about the love between a dog and his owner.  Absolutely recommended, a wonderful book.  A short very easy read.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Left me wondering why I read the whole book. I saw the movie the story was too much about him.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I liked this season the best out of the other two seasons.  The twists were aplenty and awesome to watch.  The characters really grew and changed as well.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I got the yahoo mail app hoping that I can use my Kindle for my personal and business email.  I have two business accounts with emails through yahoo.  The app doesn't support business mail.  So there is actually no difference between the yahoo mail app and the regular mail app on the kindle.  Actually the regular kindle app is probably better because you can at least bring in gmail or exchange accounts.  There is really no use for this app other than taking space.<br /><br />If they want to make this better they need to include business email accounts.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Saw this movie in the theatre and did a pre-order to be sure I got my copy the minute it was available. Awesome acting and the movie was excellent.
B00004TRD8|5.0|T2 Ultimate Edition is unbelievable, i didn't believe the hype about it at first, but wow was i wrong, special features galore, 3 making of featurettes, 3 versions of the film to choose from, it has about every little bit of information on the making of the movie, a bunch of behind the scenes video clips, i should have never got the skynet edition blu ray, this one blows this away by far, i just love the metal cover on it, looks so sharp, without a doubt the best edition of this movie thats ever been released, if your thinking of getting this movie for the first time, get this one, you will not be disapointed.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Saw this in the theatre and loved it. Had to have my own copy of course. Denzel Washington is just a fantastic actor.
B007REV4YI|4.0|As a Sean Connery fan, I never thought I would say it but Daniel Craig is awesome! I felt this movie was the most believable Bond  yet. I would give it five stars except for a plot twist that was a heartbreaker for me.
030758836X|4.0|The book was well written. Following the changes in narrator and perspective was a challenge and the end, though understandable, was disappointing.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Great storyline. Superb acting. Athough some nudity was necessary to the storyline, I felt like it was overdone. I would highly recommend this movie.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie is always evolving but is, at the same time, very consistant with his outstanding performance.  Waited a long time for a new release and a double CD was even more than expected. I must say, just like a fine wine, DB just keeps getting better and better with age. For all the Bowie fans...you need to definately buy this one to add to your collection!!! And for the non-fans(are there any?)check it out.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Storyline, acting and cinematography were all top notch! What an uplifting life lesson! Highly recommended. Share this with a loved one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy game, but have to have money to do quests in any time frame.  Sad.  But good time with hidden games.  If you are patient and take your time, then this game can be fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest daily and there is something to learn everyday. Sometimes just a new way of looking at an old problem. it is true, two heads are better than one!
B005LAIII0|5.0|Great book and visually stunning movie. I also particularly enjoyed the extra feature that described how they made the movie.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent writing.<br />Can't wait to start the third book.<br />The hbo series does a great job of following the books.
B004XZR63M|5.0|this book has come in very handy for my &#34;principle of management&#34; class.  plus I will be able to use its advise after graduation or before.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book but that didn't interfere at all. I actually prefer the book because you could see all the layers of feelings that the mother experienced. Even though I sort of knew the ending it was something that I couldn't put down. Not for the faint of heart but so real that you felt for every one in the story.
B001NLKT60|4.0|One of the best stories I have ever read.  Slightly long winded but worth the effort.  A well detailed interwoven story.
1592332803|5.0|I love this cookbook! I own all of Colleen Patrick-Goudreau's cookbooks, but this is the only one that I have used. I absolutely love this cookbook! As a vegan trying to become a master home cook, I love trying new recipes. I have made the blueberry cobbler, apple cobbler, and the drop biscuits. I made the drop biscuits with 100% organic whole wheat flour and they were absolutely amazing! All of the recipes that I have tried have been a big hit with my family! LOVE IT!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|What is there to say about such a single-purpose product?  It works. That's all I can ask of it and I'm completely satisfied.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It does work and I have used it a few times for a back up..I am not use to this sort of a thing and it was a little confusing for me to use.  But if you are very computer savy it would be great for sure
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|I start by saying that I am an Anka fan.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed in this album as a whole. There are some good takes -- Do I Love You with Dolly Parton is good, but not as good as when he recorded it with his daughter and Barry Gibb for A Body of Work. The Buble duet is a natural match. The Gloria Estefan duet is good -- she seems especially suited to sing with him -- and Le Filles De Paris with Chris Botti is just boffo. It deserves significant attention. The new tune, Find A Way Back To Your Heart, is catchy, and deserves attention.<br /><br />But instead of retreading tracks from A Body of Work, Anka could have recorded on this album tracks from Listen To Your Heart and Music Man. This Is Love could easily have been a duet. Listen to Your Heart, with David Foster (co-writer) with him, would have made sense. I would have liked to have seen some music from these two albums since they are out of print on CD and deserve a CD release. Splicing up Frank Sinatra from Anytime (I'll be There) or Everybody Ought to Be In Love would have been interesting, considering his My Way duet with Sinatra (which was originally on A Body of Work).<br /><br />It seems like it was a half-hearted effort, with the inclusion of several tracks from A Body of Work. The standard for this kind of thing is the Tony Bennett duet albums, and none of them were retread recordings from previous albums...
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Typical Harlan Coben. Fast paced with surprises around every corner. A pleasure to read!!!!! Leaves you waiting for his next work of art!!!
0439023513|5.0|I'm still in love, and think I'll always be in love, with this series. This final book is just as great as the first two.<br /><br /> It's all-out warfare in this final installment. Katniss is the face of the rebellion, whether she likes it or not. The whole political conspiracy part of the book really got to me, as it does in most books. The idea of not being able to do whatever you want, to have someone else controlling your every move . . . I wouldn't like that one bit. Katniss is dealt some serious blows in Mockingjay; will she rise above to obstacles set before her?<br /><br />All questions are answered in this book: Who will win, the Capital of the rebels? How many lives will be lost in the process? And, of course, the most important question: Peeta or Gale?  I know for many readers that's all they care about.<br /><br />Yet Mockingjay is more than just a love triangle. It's about the fight for justice. It's about where to draw the line during that fight. And it's about love, hope, family, and friendship.<br /><br />Mockingjay gets 5/5 stars from me. Go read it!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Heart wrenching. The characters are well developed and the turns of their lives are both unpredictable and, I suppose, inevitable. Hope continues to tug as the story unfolds. You wait for redemption and find it comes in the building relationships and loyalty that keeps the main characters so very much alive. One of those reads that educates as well as entertains.
1594744769|5.0|As soon as I saw that cover, I knew I was going to read the book. Is that a bad way to pick what you're going to read next? Probably. Was it worth it? Yes, because there were plenty more wonderful pictures where that came from, all scattered throughout the book. I was tempted to sneak a peek at all of them before I began reading, but I decided not to. I think that was a good decision, because the pictures directly relate to what's happening in the plot, usually when Jacob finds or thinks of a photo. That adds so much to the story!<br /><br />Besides that, the characters are fantastic. I had no idea where Miss Peregrine's was going to take me, and I loved every step of the ride. The beginning, I admit, I rushed over a bit, wanting to get into the more `peculiar' part of the book. It was interesting in its own right-detailing how everyone and their mother thought Jacob was insane-but once the peculiar parts started, I couldn't put the book down, and finished the rest that day.<br /><br />Although there were a few parts of it that I didn't like, and can't really talk about without adding a few spoilers-which I'm not going to do-the book, overall, was great. I loved it. It's something I'll re-read, and those pictures...some of them were downright creepy. Some oddly beautiful. Some, I wouldn't like to see if I was home alone, late at night . . .<br /><br />And, finally-ugh! I didn't know that there was going to be a sequel. Or, at least, it seems like there's build-up for one. Not that I mind reading more about this, but I hate going into a novel, thinking it will be completely tied up at the end . . . and be left with as many questions as I started with. Oh, well.
B009X01ELC|3.0|I bought this for my husband's Kindle Fire. It's unattractive but it serves it's purpose.The design needs improvement. The hook on the base makes it difficult to access the on and off switch of the Kindle Fire.
0385737955|4.0|Where to start? I've had this on my TBR list for quite a while now and am glad I finally got around to reading it. The premise of this book sounded so interesting and unique, I couldn't wait to get into it.<br /><br />The protagonist, Thomas, is figuring it all out along with the reader, as he has lost his memories [or had them taken away] and knows nothing of life in the Maze. Cool, but not so cool when this means the book drags a little every so often. Taking so long to get information, and then still withholding a bit of it when it's right there, can be tiring. But I got over this.<br /><br /> One thing I really liked about this novel was how the Gladers [people living inside the Maze] had developed their own slang words. It shows how different their world is from ours and gives it a little something extra. I chose the quote above because it has an example of slang-plus, it made me laugh when I read it.<br /><br />When I started this, I didn't know there were going to be other books! Don't know why I had that notion, but the sequel comes out in October, and with an ending like this one, I can't wait to see what happens next. And the author is even working on a third book! I have a feeling I'll be hooked on this series.
B002RUA54W|3.0|Enjoyed reading it. I love reading Anita Brookner.<br />Unusual ending - loved that too.<br />Beautiful scenery descriptions.<br />Enjoyable, no pretensions read
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the size of the print since I sometimes am without my glasses.  The keys are sized for easy use as well.  Really love this app
B008MG1E4A|5.0|this is a great story of how UBL was caught. i couldn't stop reading it. It was action packed. It had alot of the storyline of Zero Dark Thirty in it.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|This is a great puzzle app.  It's not like a regular puzzle, the graphics are richer and you have to move through levels finding a challenge at the end of each wherein you must assemble all the previous puzzles in 2 or 3 mins.  They simplify them and you earn stars which enable you to unlock a bonus level.  Very enjoyable.
1400049628|4.0|Okay, I'm not a big reader of books... I'll reference certain books if I need particular information, but typically I don't read full books.  But I read this cover-to-cover over a two day period.  I couldn't put it down. Regardless of a possible zombie outbreak and the obvious BS factor of the Solanum Virus, this was actually an excellent, factual, well put together collection of survival tactics should the SHTF.  It's an excellent bug-out strategy book.  I gave it 4 stars only because I thought the bogus stories (although some were based on true events) at the end of the book were silly and unnecessary.  I thought they actually took away from the valuable information in the rest of the book.  They all ended with some sort of \\"...but all evidence of this event was lost in some way\\" scenario.  I happened to be in St. Thomas when I read this book.  Out of curiosity, I asked some residents, shop keepers, and taxi drivers in Charlotte Amalie about the \\"St. Thomas Zombie\\" event, and if they knew where I could get a T-shirt.  They all looked at me like I was a Zombie.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Nice match three game with levels.Good graphics, doesn't get bogged down. One problem is it doesn't have a handy pause button,you have to go to the menu to pause.  Other than that, it's great.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well it is definitely a steamy sex book no doubt about it. Rather in the traditional sexy novels written for women. Can't say it was all that bad, but I do agree with others that it was not well written, but did explore relationships.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|The actors were good, it was just the storyline that wasn't interesting enough for me.  I watched it twice, but now it is in my archive section of dvds.  I am a huge fan of period drama, like Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, etc. but this movie just fell flat for me.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I found this movie to be very well directed, very well acted, excellent casting.  After Pride and Prejudice, this is my favorite period movie.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Nice watch that can be dressed up or down; fits comfortably; great fashion statement piece.  Shipment was fast and on time!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have just had this a very short while, so I can't comment on its durability, but the cord appears to be the same cord that originally came with my new Kindle PW.  I have had no problems with my original cord; this cord I just purchased was to be a spare that I could carry to work with me.  Having a spare allows me to charge my Kindle at work, so it is always charged more than half way.  This cord seems to charge just the same as the original cord.  If I have problems with either of them in the future, other than just normal wear and tear, I will try to remember to update this review.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is another great one from Joe Bonamassa. This guy is such a talented<br />guitar virtuoso at such a young age.  I thoroughly am enjoying  this acoustic version of his playing.<br />  He is in a league of his own, but I will count him among my favorite guitar players of B.B.<br />King, Jeff Beck, Johnny Lane, Peter Frampton, and Jimi Hendrix.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield was a great show.  If you've never seen it watch for the intensity of the actors and the extreme nature of the job the Strike Team does in LA.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Can't wait to see the 4th season.  Each season gets better and better.  So many twists and I'm hooked! Can't wait to watch the Fourth Season.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|WE have enjoyed this amplifier to listen to the spring birds.  Love to hear them and watch them. Perfect to this purpose.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book is amazingly awesome. It's one of those books that you will want to read over and over and over again
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane's writing are all wonderful.  This is one picked for a book club.  I gladly read it again.  So many more of her books are equally as interesting.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It's a great book.  Sometimes when you read long books it's not to sit down and read it but this one is.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Really liked this book that took off after Pride and Prejudice.  I had just read the Austen book again and enjoyed joining the interesting group of characters again.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I like the way that Bond has been re-invented with Daniel Craig in the lead role. I think that Skyfall truly has captured the magic of the old James Bond movies. At the same time it both pays tribute to and even pokes a little fun at the old series. I have always liked You only Live Twice and The Man with the Golden Gun. I think that Skyfall is better. I think that the character Mallory is a great addition. While I think John Cleese is a great comedic actor, I think that he was not a good fit to replace Desmond Lewellyn as Q. I like that they went with a young actor rather than trying to replace the late Mr. Lewellyn. The plot is intriguing. I love what they did with the villain. It was fresh to see a villain whose motives are valid even if his actions are over the top. I highly recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I didn't buy it but downloaded it from my library for my Kindle, so at least it was free.  Through the first half, I couldn't put it down and kept thinking, wow, it's been a long time since I read a book this good.  It was engrossing and, at times, laugh-out-loud funny.  I kept thinking what a good movie could be made from the story.  Thus my three-star rating.  Then it all began to fall apart.  The characters turned out to be completely unredeemable, vile human beings.  The only character I really came to like was Detective Boney.  And then...it just...ended, with no resolution.  I kept trying to advance my Kindle thinking, there have to be more pages!  But alas, no.  My other gripe is that although I am not a prude, I thought that some of the sexual content was beyond crude and unnecessary.
B009CGAMK6|5.0|My first exposure to Les Miserables came when I was in the high school concert band. I enjoyed the music then. I enjoyed watching the anniversary concerts on PBS, I was glad to see this available here. I still enjoy the music of Les Miserables. If you like the music, this is worth the investment of time and money.
B0056JJ1M8|4.0|An excellent performance by Samuel L. Jackson in the lead role along with strong performances from the rest of the crew. A true life story of a coach who decides to believe in a higher standard for his students and pushes them to achieve it, this is a movie that shows how sports can help build character in students which will help them in life.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|This is not anything new. It is not a re-imagining of the stage musical. It is simply translated to the big screen. That is enough for me. I actually like Russell Crowe in the role of Javert. I like the way the music was integrated into the scene rather than interrupting the scene as in a traditional musical. If you are a fan of Les Miserables, it is worth it. If you don't like musicals, this is definitely not for you.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Works fine but a little quiet. Sliding mechanism is not quite a mechanism, just slides. Not exactly perfect. Pens work great, light is fun, buttons are fine. You could tell the plastic molding isn't lined up perfectly but good product all around.
B0093QIEZA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this film. It incorporates elements of Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Nordic culture into a great film. The characters are interesting, the story is engaging, the Morwyn is well thought out. Even the motivation behind the Morwyn's actions are believable. Ron Perlman is great as the hammer wielding Gunnar. If you enjoy Science Fiction, Fantasy, Beowult (the story not the animated film), or Scandinavia it is worth watching.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|Bad religion has to  be one of the greatest punk rock bands of all time. From No Control to True North, they have been consistent throughout the years and this is a fantastic album
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am enjoying this addition to the series, I read a couple of negative comments but if you go into it with the understanding that the events in this book took place in order to show the full spectrum story from every character's view it will make alot of sence. Both books follow the same time line, only viewed through different eyes.
1571200851|5.0|Very nice book in excellant condition. I plan to use it soon. Cover was pretty. Haven't had time to read alot of it yet.
B00015TX7K|5.0|I still recall first hearing this in early 1971. They pick up where the Nice left off. This lp paved the way for many other European prog/keyboard bands who tried to imitate what Keith and the boys do here. This features never-before-heard integration of piano, organ and synth, all held tightly together by Carl Palmer's intricate percussion.<br />My faves are The Barbarian, Take A Pebble and Knife's Edge. The hit single Lucky Man is the grade finale.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington played the lead role to perfection.  His nuanced performance was the best that I have seen this year.  The movie is highly charged and keeps you on the edge of your seat sometimes and is thought-provoking at others.  Great film.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|It was free so I shuldn't complain to much...The story line was well done but the game play was boring to me...tc
B00A8ECU24|4.0|There are a few annoying quirks, like it freezes on occasion and there are some parts you can't play without real money. However it functions really well and keeps my pony obsessed 5yr old daughter entertained.
B000FA675C|5.0|I re-read Da Vinci Code and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a fast moving chase novel with lots of analysis of symbols interlaced.  In reading it the second time I got a better feel for the trail of clues and symbols.  It is a novel worth revisiting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVE this series! The quality of the video is perfect and I love watching it on my iPad on their convenient amazon streaming app.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I read this book in school and I'm revisiting it.  (It was free on Kindle) Initially I was reluctant since I didn't recall it as great experience.  The text is somewhat dense but I appreciate it more with many additional years to understand the background.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's a great game to just kick back and have some good fun killing demons and zombies. You can get sweet weapons and if your willing to spend some cash you can upgrade amour weapons.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I really liked this book.  It sat here and laughted out loud to myself several times; descriptive writing.  Would recommend
B000009RNM|5.0|Well bowie knows how to do music in different ways. And the song I really likes is sorrow and its on this cd and its all good to listen to.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I have been having a good time (staying up half the night...) figuring out this new rendition of Angry Birds. I am a fairly new player to Angry Birds. I got my tablet for Christmas and the first thing I purchased was the original Angry Birds. I also bought the Bad Piggies, and I am not too crazy about that one. I will have to go back later and try it again. I'm glad it was relatively inexpensive just in case I decide to give up on it. May the force be with you!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Have always loved ebay. You can always find just about anything u want on ebay and for a good price too. It will never get old!!!
B001HN6918|5.0|The first time I watched this movie (I've seen it three times now), the first half seemed to drag on a bit. But then Po's full flashback begins and the whole movie evolved into an incredibly beautiful and moving sequel storyline. Amazing soundtrack, amazing animation, and even a more amazing message to take home.
B002R1S9PI|3.0|Demi Moore was hot but Bert Reynolds was ridiculous.<br />Strip scenes were very well choreographed. I would not buy this movie at any price.
1611761565|5.0|I wasn't sure how this audio book would be but from the very first chapter it grabs you and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Very well written and read too. I would compare it to how a Stephen King book grabs you in the first few sentences. I highly recommend it to all american's and thank all the U.S. Navy Seals for their service!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun, exciting game. Sort of mindless but a lot of fun.<br /><br />Similar to those running and jumping games - just great fun
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great book.  As usual, couldn't put it down.  Have now read all the Jack Teacher books.  Love the puzzle and learning about weapons and how to fight.
1781161313|3.0|Lots of black and white photos and sketches.  Looks like it was fan base created as opposed to something more professional.
B000FA675C|5.0|It was a better read the second time around.  Dan keeps your attention all the way through the book.  Even the potential for a romance is hinted at which I thought was a nice undertone.
B007REV4YI|1.0|One of the best bond movie ... NO  complains abt that ....<br /><br />my issue here is with the digital copy .... i payed for bray,DVD and digital copy...<br /><br />It seems I can use the digital copy only with FLIXSTER ..  most stupid app and application ...<br />They don't even allow me to download the file in format i like and use on iPhone ...<br />We need to have FLIXSTER app it seems ... so pay and you will be still begging them ...<br />The movie can't be played with any other software ....<br />serious carp ....
B001AIRUOU|5.0|love this movie. great collectors set. sometimes it's nice to have a hard copy, and this is the one to have.
0765317389|5.0|Still one of the best SciFi books I've ever read. I enjoyed this book more than the rest of the series.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I've seen this movie several times over the years and yes, I look forward to watching it again. It passes my \\"more than once\\" test, because it's a great movie for those days when I need to have my spirits lifted. The combination of romance, comedy, music, dancing and interesting characters always leaves me with a smile on my face.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Touch sensitivity is AWFUL. It's almost impossible to pick up objects. Trying to click on objects very rarely results in actually picking them up. It just makes the main character run uselessly towards the object you're trying to do anything with. Fine, it's fun to type almost anything and make it appear, but that does not a game make. You can't actually DO anything because touching the screen is so WILDLY UNPREDICTABLE. If I could refund this app, I would have already. Since I cannot, all I can do is encourage you not to make the same mistake. Run, run far away from this app right now. In fact, since today learning that no app can ever be refunded, I'm nervous to buy any again, in case they're as useless as this. (For reference, I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got this for my son, for a complete dvd collection & price very reasonable all in one box. nice
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|This thrilling journey of Katy's first huge your keeps your senses tingling! It is very honest and emotional, Katy reveals the unique sides to her personality and her success. If you want to know more about Katy Perry, this is the movie for you!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you don't read anything else for a while you must read this novel! Defending Jacob is a page turner that takes you inside a family's  unimaginable depths of despair. The author will take you inside their most private lives and a long, torturous and sensationalized trial. In the end, you wonder what you would do if you were in their position. Love takes all forms and this book will take you to the far corners of what a toll real love can take. Well written and the author has an excellent grasp of courtroom drama and how the media circus can change perceptions so quickly. This is one you can't put down.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I really like this movie. it was well  worth watching.. This movie held my interest all the way through it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an amazing book. Great for escapism and people who like an intelligent, well-written mystery/thriller. The characters unusual and very smart which makes the story move along smoothly and quickly. The premise for this novel probes into our darkest thoughts and desires. In the end we wonder if we could pull something like this off? See for yourself...it's a great read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app works great, just like a &#34;regular &#34; calculator. The numbers & all symbols are nice and big & best of all the app was free.
B00A8Z6KN8|4.0|I ordered the album due to the last music at the end of the movie. It is a fabulous piece that should have been an easy Oscar nominee, The rest of the album has some good points, with the theme running through in various dimensions. Not something you will be lulled by, but it has it's good points and The Song of the Lonely Mountain seems to be a You Tube favorite.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just got this game two weeks ago, didn't purchase anything with real money, and I already unlocked all of the mane six except for Rainbow Dash. The only thing I don't like is the ad's when the game starts. My advice would be to not spend ANY gems, even when the game tells you to, because then it just takes longer to unlock Rarity.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|Compré esta película en honor a mi adolescencia.<br />Hace mucho no veía la película , así que solo tenía un vago recuerdo de ella pero recordaba bien la historia. casi 20 años después, no me pareció tan buena después de todo. El audio esta desbalanceado y la banda sonora (Queen) se siente un poco deslavada. Lástima. la probé en dos reproductores (Power DVD 12 y  en el Samsung ) probé dos pantallas ( LG Smart TV 42&#34;) y Samsung P2570) y los resultados no cambiaron mucho.<br />El Video tiene muchos artefactos y Se nota bastante  que el tamaño en que fue filmada es inferior. El color es vivo pero no salva al filme. De las películas que tengo de esa época en Bluray es la que peor se ve.<br /><br />El tiempo de entrega fue el esperado y bien empacado.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|I have watched this movie a few times and have enjoyed it each time. I always seem to pick up different things each time.
B006H5120E|4.0|El Bluray se ve genial. Una vez ajuste bien el 3D la película brilla por si sola. es mi primer disco en 3D y no podía desaprovechar la oferta. Claro que una película de esa duración con gafas no es para todo el mundo y puede experimentar cansancio si no esta habituado. A pesar de eso una gran película.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Most Boring movie I ever saw. i fell asleep, and had to see ending the next day ha hah ha
B004XDYJRU|1.0|A good product except that it will not update to the new release. The failure to update has existed since at least January 2013. Fix it, people!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|That is exactly what you think about these two,that they are a disaster.......but their NOT! This was a great story about young LOVE that can sometimes rip you apart. Can't wait for the next book.
B005K17RU0|1.0|If it is not broke, DON'T FIX IT.  The new app is not User friendly.  I could see all I needed to see at a glance with the old app.  Bring it back.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I ordered this movie as a family night movie. My kids just loved this movie. They watched it 5 times with the 48 hour rental!
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|THis movie was way to long and just not that funny.  It could have been 1.5 hours and that would have been plenty
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|You can tell that Clancy has not written this book, he may have did outline but this is not the kind of Jack Ryan novel you would expect.  I believe they have run there course in Ryan novel and/or Clancy should get back to writing his books without help.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Predictable in some parts, and similar to Safe Haven. Overall, a romantic and cute book with a couple smile-inducing characters.
0765325950|5.0|I have followed this series for years and the loss of RJ was felt in the last few books.  But all in all Sanderson has done an excellent job is following RJ's final thoughts for the series.  If you haven't read the series start with book 1 you will not be disappointed
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Since downloading it, first I couldn't get out of it. Finally reset the Kindle. Now I can't get more than 10 seconds out of it before it knocks me back to the home page
B000066C6Z|5.0|If you like airplane or naked gun you'll like this movie. Hilarious spoof during WWII. A young VAL Kilmer is good in this movie.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You can't do anything without the power ups. As soon as my power-ups are gone, this game will be gone.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Fantastic music. Awesome composition. Transports you back to all those great moments in the movie. Love the extra info that came in the jacket. Great extra tracks too. And best of all, it is Auto Rip. I was listening to it before I got actual cd. Hope the rest of the music for the movie is as good. Howard Shore and London Philharmonic did an excellent job.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy thiis game too, but I am not smart enough to know how to open  the challange puzzles.  I need directions.  I have always<br />played Mahjong and don't understand why I can't get going on this.  I still like playing the games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is sure to be a sci-fi classic. I was hooked from the beginning and continually kept guessing by a number of amazing plot twists. As well, the characters are engaging, relatable, and well-developed. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who likes science fiction, dystopia novels, post-apocalyptic works, or thrillers. Well done!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Just like waiting on the mail man...I like hearing from my family and friends.  So I use this everyday.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I REALLY loved this book. I loved the history and the suspence.  I couldn't put the book down.I am looking for more like it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Please add more energy capability than 50! I love the game and play everyday due to a disability that keeps me home. Also bring back more decorations like the flowers.  And fix bugs. my screen constantly flickers but only on this game. I would love to give 5 stars but I'm starting to get bored with waiting for energy and regretting. spending money on this game to just have to quit playing.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is great. You can hardly wait to read  the whole book.I have quite a few of his books.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Well this game is amazing except one thing th  kung fu is glitched because I got one score of 45500 and it gave me one acorn plz fix other wise great game
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie keeps you engaged. The plot is little predictable and out of the ordinary.  But the cinematography, costume and effects are good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved, loved, loved all three books. At first I was like what is all the fuss and hoopla about Fifty Shades. So I finally decided to break down and read it and I couldn't put the book down! I had to read more and boy am I glad I did! Awesome series ! I can't wait for Christian point of view in the series. I am deffinately going to reread the books again, it was that good!
B000FA675C|5.0|Read it again and it was like reading it for the first time.  One of my all time favorite books. Simply excellent!
B002O1TMI4|5.0|Contains the mix of sounds I've grown to expect from Muse.  Still a good listen through and through.  Recommended to help complete any muse collection.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have to admit that Daniel Craig has redeemed himself.  I was disappointed with the last couple of movies that he was in as James Bond but this movie has made me change my mind.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Most amazing TV experience I've ever had. Wonderful riveting story backed up by outstanding visual 3D effects.<br />Photography is certainly Oscar worthy.<br />I must have
B008602KQI|5.0|I love stories about survival and this is a good one although it takes a while to get to the survival part.  Jennifer Lawrence is perfect but I didn't buy the love story.  Visually spectacular, thoughtful and insightful.  I highly recommend.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Fun read for an adult - fun to see what was adapted for the movies. Easy adult read, nice break from more serious fare.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I liked this one. I love the point and click adventure aspect of these games but am not a fan of hidden object scenes. In this one you have the option of playing a tile game instead of completing the hidden object scenes to get the item you need- loved that!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slow moving in the beginning but got my attention pretty quickly.  Couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to reading more from Flynn.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Great continuance of Enders journey but a little too much philosophy not as much action as Enders Game. All in all a decent sequel.
B0051OZ564|4.0|I liked the movie, the animation was great.  Interesting structure with intermingled plots that were all related to each other.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Naomi Watts Acting pulls me in.... I feel like I'm in the water next to her...(or wish I was)...Typical storyline...Tom Holland was great!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones are fantastic and honest. I recommend to anyone looking for a good set of studio headphones that won't break the banks.
B00821OX98|4.0|The only bad thing I have to say and its really not that bad. For a show based in Boston the least they could have done was shot the series in Boston!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app.  I can tell what the Weather is going to be like now and maybe 7 days from now.  Not just where I live but also by my Mom's who lives quite a distance from me.  Very handy.
1582701709|5.0|This is a relacement for the one I let some one use and needed to have a copy for myself. Believe the book, read it for yourself.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Loved it! Surprisingly witty, clever, interesting. Great setting and a splash of history I knew nothing about. The scene when they first visit plum island seemed to drag on but of course that info sure came in handy later
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Great music album and brings back good memories of the old days with Donna Summers.  I will continue to buy more of her music albums.
B00B780TAK|4.0|I loved watching it so much until they made few good people die. It's just doesn't make sense. But it's very catchy to watch.
B005N09L5C|5.0|GREAT ACTING, SETS AND STORY.  I HAVE WATCHED THIS MANY TIMES AND STILL FIND IT'S MESSAGE FASCINATING!  THERE IS A LESSON IN THE MESSAGE FOR ALL OF US GOING THROUGH OUR PRESENT PROBLEMS.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Very good story idea, very interesting. Too much detail in many places. I think I would prefer a reader's digest version of this story. To be fair, I am only about 85 percent through the book.
B004KU832S|5.0|This set is great, my 2 year old loves it. We also took the batteries out because the sound got tiring. One thing I do not like about this set is that the wheels of the train cars do not spin as nicely as other trains we have (Thomas and Ikea). My daughter does not care about that though, so this still gets 5 stars.
B0017OB12O|5.0|The movie is a classic and the blu-ray presented it in terrific color and contrast, looking quite modern. It is a long film, but well worth it to see the performances, especially by Sir Alec Guinness
B000FA675C|5.0|Although it seems old hat to us now, and hardly anything comes out that surprises or shocks us anymore, this book took the world by storm when it was published. I believe it was the horrible movie that wore off its novelty with how it's been played to death.
0345803493|4.0|I liked this one a little better than the first one. It has more of a story line.  To me the sex isn't quite as kinky as the first book.  Of course it's totally unrealistic but it's still a fun romp through a box that's definitely a page turner and a turn on.  Fairy tales are unrealistic but we still read them and this is definitely an adult fairy tale.  And it's written totally from the woman's point of view which makes it feel closer to home for women.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I loved the jumping eggs. The digital copy is not.so.easy to download. The package was in a perfect box. God good
0765325950|5.0|The Wheel of Time series has come to a close in an admirable fashion.<br /><br />How do you end a world/time spanning saga?  Either with a big party or a 900 page battle.  Brandon Sanderson has chosen the battle, Shayol Ghul.  The warriors from the nations, and major centers meet, to battle over the seals on the Dark One's prision. Characters from the previous books re-appear, to play their part, to assert their destiny, and conclude the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />Much has already been written about this series, and the individual books, but as a whole, the WOT is a rich tapesty of storytelling, wonder, and fantasy.  Previous generations have had their King Arthur legends, their Lord of the Rings, their series.  This is our generations, and it will continue on and inspire new tales of adventure and mythology.<br /><br />The work of blending previously plotted, and written material is a skill.  It is little wonder that Sanderson both writes, and teaches said skill.  He will be considered a grand master.  Let us consider the prophecy....In those days, a man, Sanderson, will arise, and create modern myths and legends, will bear the torch, and will be one of the greats...<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
B001HADE00|4.0|Released in 1984, \\"Out of the Cellar\\" was hard rock band Ratt's debut album. The album is easily considered one of the genre's best, and this baby put Ratt on the map in a big way.<br /><br />After releasing a couple of song EP, Ratt finally entered the studio to record their debut album with producer extraordinaire Beau Hill. The partnership would spawn three subsequent records, and add many accolades to Ratt's credit. The sound of this record is undeniably rooted in the early 80s metal scene. Just check out the \\"Round and Round\\" video and see what I mean. While many consider this Ratt's finest hour, I tend to disagree. I actually like their follow-up record just a little better. Every song on this album is enjoyable and rocking, and not liking this is almost an admission to not liking good music.<br /><br />I can't imagine many 80s rock fans not having this in their collection by now, but if you don't, you better get it as quick as possible.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Was just what we were looking for to take on trips.  Easier to keep the phone charged and not have to worry about charging at the motels.
B000002IJO|4.0|Releasing their third album in as many years, melodic rock band Ratt dropped \\"Dancing Undercover\\" in 1986. This album is easily one of the most forgotten good albums of the decade, and how it doesn't garner more attention is beyond me.<br /><br />Ratt were like a machine in the early/mid-80s. These guys just kept releasing strong album after strong album, but never seemed to reach the crest of bands like Poison or Bon Jovi. The sound of the record is identical to the previous two, and this eventually led to the band dismissing producer Beau Hill. Why change a tire that isn't flat is beyond me, but that's what these guys thought would finally put them over the top. The songs on \\"Dancing Undercover\\" are all hard rockers; no ballads or filler makes their way into the records mix this time around. Favorites are \\"Dance,\\" \\"Slip of the Lip,\\" \\"Body Talk\\" and \\"One Good Lover.\\"<br /><br />This should be in every melodic rock fans collection, to be quite honest. There's no way to not like the brand of hard rock these guys played, and after several listens, you'll wonder why these guys never became the biggest band of the 80s.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is great to see Sam and Dean acting like their old selves. The story style keeps you on the edge and each episode stays on track, unlike some of the previous seasons. It is nice to see the king of hell acting like he should, too. Crowley is by far the most interesting villain to date.
B000002IGV|4.0|Hard rock band Twisted Sister released their most acclaimed record \\"Stay Hungry\\" in 1984. This was the absolute peak for the band, and after this album's success, it was all down hill from there for Twisted Sister.<br /><br />This is easily every Twisted Sister's fan favorite release, right? Wrong! It's not my favorite release; but it's very close to the top of my list. I prefer their \\"Love Is For Suckers\\" release, but this is cool as well. Looking at the cover of this album, one could envision something close to Alice Cooper or some shock rock band. This simply isn't the case. This is chalked full of good time 80s hard rock tunes, and has one of the genre's best ballads, period! While I don't enjoy every song on this album, the majority of the tracks are pretty cool. Favorite songs are \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" \\"The Price,\\" \\"I Wanna Rock\\" and \\"S.M.F.\\"<br /><br />If you're looking for something out of the ordinary for 80s melodic rock fans, I'd check these guys out. I like them myself, and can't see any 80s rock fans not liking at least some of the songs off this album.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|this was a fun game along the lines of professor Layton,  but darker. but after 20 minutes I was told I had to spend $5.99 for the rest of the game. I did,  but game wont load,  and when I removed it to try again,  a portion said it stayed. weird!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|no problems with this well done app!  easy to set up and it gets the job done. the little weather report is a nice bonus.
0374214913|4.0|I loved the first third of this novel. The protagonist was witty, funny and the plot had an edge. But then it all leveled out. It was a good book. I liked it. I am disappointed it lost its momentum and wasn't a great book though. I will still recommend it and I think it will create some good conversation starters.
B00B9LNLTQ|2.0|I'm not going to be the one to say what kind of music a band should or should not be making, but if you were hoping this was the album where they would go back to \\"Is This It\\" you're out of luck. This album is far more disco, far more new wave than either Casablanca's solo album (which I greatly enjoyed) or Angles (which I enjoyed most of). There are a few good songs here and there, but honestly I've had a hard time making it all the way through this album. Just seems like they don't care if they alienate their old fans, almost seems like they\\"re trying to do it on purpose actually. Don't buy this one just because you like the strokes, make sure you listen to it first and know what you're getting yourself into.
B007SGM084|4.0|The text was well written however I felt the end was abrupt and rushed. I hope this means there will be another book that fills in the gaps. I'd like to read about the process of the transformation of Christian throughout the pregnancy and Ted's infancy. I also want to know more about the connection to Hyde and if Hyde had been planning something different before he stumbled upon Ana. There could be more adventures in the Red Room, and fewer repeats of the vanilla.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|The alarm clock is easy to set. I like most of the music choices.  It is a pleasant way to wake up.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Been listening to the new album back to back all day. Although some songs have the new wave Blondie/No Doubt sound to them, it's not bad. I like all the songs but I really love these songs above the rest:<br /><br />*Future<br />*Anklebiters<br />*Part II<br />*Last Hope<br />*(One of Those) Crazy Girls<br /><br />If you like No Doubt, Blondie, or Garbage, then you should have no problems liking this album. Hayley's voice is strong as ever and the band in total sounds great. It's a new direction but it's a GOOD new direction! This might be my favorite Paramore album. This album has so much power and enjoyment in it, it shows how happy the band truly are right now.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Alien franchise is awesome especially Alien 1 and Aliens. The book this comes in, has awesome artwork and the picture of the blu ray is phenominal!
B00969PR18|5.0|This app is better than map quest.  It shows you the best route and is easy to use.  I highly recommend it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  The characters were different and you had empathy for them.  The story line was well structured.  Mr. Grisham is an excellent writer.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Before the release of the movie I picked it up a second, maybe even third time.  I still had a hard time putting it down.  Great book, easy read. The movie is great can't wait for the next one.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|For a movie that came highly recommended I was truly disappointed in the story line and though the action was good when it came I was not impressed.
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books. I loved the DaVinci Code as well as all of his others.  They just get better and better. If you want a book you can't put down pick up any Dan Brown book.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Delta Machine<br /><br />When I think of this title, I think of wonderful years of driving through the Mississippi Delta (think Fly on The Windscreen with sweat dripping down the face) and listening to these unique Englishmen who make music through machines. That's my own personal way of interpreting the new work:  an inspired collection of songs influenced by American blues, and country, transmuted through elaborate looking, and sounding, electronic devices for your endless listening pleasure.<br /><br />Like the divine convergence of blues and electronic on Recoil's Subhuman, or much of Nick Cave's spiritual striving oeuvre, the mystical, and divine, seem to emanate from such impressive collaboration within creativity. And DM always takes it to new heights.<br /><br />The rapturous songs on this work expand across your soul's landscape to evolve into a symphony of power, and intrigue, that leave the listener brimming with excitement. While this highly impressive work does not grab hold of my attention from start to finish like Music for the Masses, or Black Celebration, the great heights it achieves demonstrate that DM can mine very familiar territory, and themes, in the realm of lyricism; and manage to successfully find new directions through which to fly. \\"Heaven\\" is as beautiful as \\"Wrong\\" was haunting; these two songs representing just some of the incredible highlights of recent work by this enduring band. There is so much to love here...<br /><br />Alan Wilder brought a cohesion to DM works that now strangely seems missing, though DM continues to create majestic and profound music together. They have discovered fascinating new avenues in his absence...<br /><br />I am endlessly excited by our own Personal Jesus in the form of this enduring and unparalleled band...
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian Hunter is one of our best artists, and I own everything I can find that he has recorded.<br /><br />I'M EDITING MY REVIEW after successive listenings.  I do think that sometimes he plays down some of his strengths--primarily in that his voice is sometimes mixed a little low.  On the positive side, I do think as well that he is carrying on the Chuck Berry tradition, which, really, with Bo Diddley, is rock and roll.  It's about narrative, wit, and sly turns on an expected phrase.  I was stupid not to catch the added measure on the hook for \\"Something Comfortable.\\"  My flaw, not his.  It insinuates sex better than probably anything since Chuck patented rock and roll insinuation.<br /><br />The song that really turned me around, well, heightened my appreciation is more accurate,  is \\"When I'm President.\\"  It has a gorgeous melody, of course, but it's a kind of yearning you don't get outside of Springsteen when he's in that mood:  the idea that politics is hopelessly flawed, but it's what we've got.  Springsteen does it metaphorically;  Hunter hits it straight on.  It's really a passionate love song, full of idealism, bitterness, and finally resignation...the hallmarks of any truly great love song.  Just that's about an ideal, not a woman.  I'd buy this just for that one song alone, and the rest of the song are no bunts to the pitcher.<br /><br />What you'll find are great melodies, obviously, but some very handsome guitar hooks that stand up with the best of Mott.  You'll hear some eerie twists on Dylan, when do you not, but now it's older Dylan, which is just plain charming.<br /><br />I love this artist and would wish to meet him and shake his hand, because no one can do this anymore, or appears to want to, except of course Springsteen in the mainstream, and the real country guys like Steve Earle.  But that's another subject for another time.  This is a very fine record, and I would recommend it most highly.  Life is better with Ian Hunter in it.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This season brings out the best in Daryl yet, and love the way Carl is handling things. Rick is unhinged, but I don't like him much anyways.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Fabulous sets, lush cinematography, believable characters The Borgias may not be all historical accuracy about the personal lives  but it is truly a well spent weekly hour of willing suspension of disbelief.  The series has instigated a curiosity about the Rennaisance and the families and individuals who shaped world culture.  It's a gas!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I'm new to Volbeat.<br />The first song I've ever heard was the Kind Diamond contribution on the amazing Room 24.<br />I liked that song so much I decided to buy the disc.<br />If you're new to Volbeat the group pretty much encompasses rock, metal, thrash, death metal and some country.<br />A strange combination to be sure but they pull it off with amazing results.<br />My favorite songs so far are...<br /><br />Let's Shake Some Dust.<br />Nameless One<br />Dead but Rising<br />Room 24<br />My Body...incredible vocals.<br />Lola Montez<br />Doc Holiday<br /><br />All in all I can't help but gush about this group.<br />Amazing vocals, bass, guitars and drums.<br />I can't believe they've flown under my radar for this long.<br />One of 2013's best easily.<br />If you like music period you'll like this.<br />Recommended.
1401232590|4.0|I bought this book for the writer (Loeb) and artist (Sale), not for the story itself, though the book had been recommended by a friend as well. The book is much larger than the usual GN/TPB, which surprised me given the fairly low price. The quality of the cover and pages is exceptional, with glossy paper and bright, vivid ink colors. The story revolving around the villain, &#34;Holiday&#34;, was exceptionally well written, and deals mainly with the mob families in Gotham dealing with the murders of their family members. The episodic nature of the story, from one holiday murder to the next, was not as engaging as I was hoping, though, and became a bit tedious after a while. If I recall, this was originally published as 13 individual comics, which is quite a long run for a single story (and 350+ pages!). Among Loeb's work, I feel that this is his best, but it may require a second reading to truly appreciate the art--once through for the overall story, and again for the art. I give it 4/5 stars, losing one for the tediousness of the story at certain points. I mean, this is Batman, the Detective himself, and it takes him over a year to crack the case? I will say no more to avoid spoilers, but that was hard to believe in the end, and the story was clearly dragged on a little too long. This is a must-have book for every Batman fan.
B00BF124PC|3.0|It is a long video CC was easy to set and the stream was good and clear. All in all I enjoyed it.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book was really good, but I wouldn't say I loved it. Actually, I saw the movie first and I wanted to read to book to clarify my thoughts about the story. Well, the film is a perfect &#34;replica&#34; of the book, so this failed to happen, but it was enjoyable to read it. This is a book everybody should read, it gives you perspective and it makes you think about your life, your believes and God (or gods).<br />Sometimes a book is really slow, which is OK with me, but for some it may be boring!
B00BU2SIW4|2.0|Another reviewer said it best so I would like to reiterate what they said:<br /><br />&#34;I miss the days when Martin could churn out a catchy hook on just about every song and that each track on the album could be potential radio hits. These days I feel like the creativity well is running on empty and their better writing days are well behind them. This is where Alan Wilder's presence is sorely missed!&#34;<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are some bright spots on this album.  But, for the most part, it lacks that energy, beat, and classic hook that made me appreciate DM from years ago.  It could just be that they are getting old and the imagination and energy tank is dry.
B005TKD6NY|5.0|It has been a long time since a book was able to touch me. Norwegian Wood was truly excellent, I was nearly crying it was so full of feeling! I recommend this book to everybody!
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|If I could have given a negative star rating, I would. Don't pay attention to the morons who are questioning the negative reviews, because the negative reviews are sadly 100% correct. I was at the theater in 1988 to see the original \\"Die Hard,\\" and I've been a huge fan of the franchise and of Bruce Willis ever since then. I know what I'm talking about when I say that \\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\" was nothing that even remotely resembled a Die Hard movie, and at best it barely passes as yet another typical mindless, forgettable action flick of modern day movies. The action genre is almost completely dead, and this movie didn't help to change that. If you haven't seen it, save your money and enjoy the other movies in the franchise.

B000XR4OC0|3.0|So this is my 3rd attempt at getting the correct size, or rather a size that will fit properly. The first pair I ordered was my standard size, 6.5. The were way too big. Based on several review suggestions, I went down an entire size when I returned the first pair and reordered a new pair.. The second pair was too small. My foot fit in lengthwise but they felt tight and the insole felt too narrow at the pinky toe area (like my toe was hanging off the side). Back they went. Now I'm going to see if 6 works. If not, oh well, I'll stick to slip on Vans.

Never saw the play, so the film is what we were moved by...love the way the singing and orchestra is &#34;live&#34; ...smart move on the directors part as that makes the characters so moving and real. Ahh, what a good cry awaits.
B000002H5I|5.0|Excellent
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Great film...saw this &#34;On Demand&#34; on Comcast TV, and had to purchase it. Before seeing it the first time, we hadn't read any reviews,  but knew it had won  several awards. We thought(feared?) the movie would have a predictable ending...happy to be wrong and thoroughly enjoyed the journey.  The personalities of the two actors shine through with the visuals and dialogue ( yes, it is captioned) What a delight! My daughter (nurse/home health aid) thought it perfect too.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app! It's nice being able to choose the sounds to aid in calming me to sleep, and even better that I can select a timer to shut off app after I fallen asleep! This is great for my children as well, but I don't like sharing :-)

B000001EXB|4.0|Even Sir Elton John would be the first to admit that he has had his purple patch, and has subsequently earned his place in the rock'n'roll hall of fame with some terrific rock standards. \\"The Big Picture\\" has some catchy tunes which are up to Elton's impeccable standards. I, for one, especially like the soulful hymn\\"If the River can Bend\\". And let's not forget Bernie Taupin's lyrics. He single handedly brought literacy to rock and roll.

B00BF11STU|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. This movie is not just about killing a terrorist which is great too. It is about a woman dedication and determination to complete her assignment successfully. It is about leaders recognizing this quality in an individual and putting their full support behind this individual. I recommended this movie to wife to watch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so amazing!!!! It's John Green's best book!!! It's is the only book that successfully got me to cry (and that takes a lot) I say that anyone should read it if you're over 12. I got this book about 3 months ago an dive read it 4 times!!! No other book can top it. Read it if you like romance novels!!! I would give it a million stars if I could!!! It annoyed me when she recites some poetry, but it doesn't happen that often. READ IT!!!!!!!! YOU MUST!!!!!

B008S80PCE|4.0|Given the bargain price of this import box set, it is a steal!  You get nine Bill Withers albums in one box set, with a book containing a short remembrance by Withers himself, as well as a short essay by another author.  All of the album artwork is reproduced in the booklet, while the CDs come in miniature LP replicas of their original packaging (&#34;Carnegie Hall&#34; is a gatefold, and &#34;Still Bill&#34; has the &#34;French door&#34; style front cover to it, just like the original LP). The discs themselves feature period-correct labels.<br /><br />I consider a handful of Withers' albums to be essential but at this price, you can own the whole set for the cost of those two or three CDs.  The mastering on this set is nice also.  However, the version of &#34;Menagerie&#34; in this set is not a reissue of the earlier single CD that featured the bonus tracks; you will want to hang onto that disc if you already own it.  &#34;'Bout Love&#34; makes its CD debut with this package, as it was the last piece in my collection of Withers' recordings on digital that I did not yet own.<br /><br />The one quibble I have with this set: where are the b-sides, rarities, etc.?  &#34;Better Days&#34; from the rare Sussex Records soundtrack to the little known &#34;Man and Boy&#34; film would have been a good choice, as well as his 45-RPM-only release, &#34;U.S.A.&#34; (which I have not been able to find in any digital form).  The demo &#34;Rosie&#34; (which appears on &#34;Menagerie&#34;) would have fit in here nicely also, and there are several guest appearances and remixes that could fill up a disc rather quickly.<br /><br />Some of these discs appear to be recent masterings, and as such they all sound quite good.<br /><br />Aside from the lack of rarities, this is a highly recommended box set.  Get one while you still can!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was alerted to this deal from gizmodo.com.  I wasn't really looking for a watch, but this is such a great deal for an automatic, that I jumped on it.<br /><br />Seiko makes good watches and this one is no exception.  The workmanship is excellent.  Materials are good, the watch feels slight but is solid.  So far very accurate, much more so than my other automatic watch from Marathon.<br /><br />I personally am still on that 'big watch face' kick so to speak.. Well, at least a little bigger than usual.  This watch face is the 'usual' size.  I'd like it more if the watch face is bigger.<br /><br />I haven't worn a watch with a cloth/leather band in a long while, but this watch band is comfortable, and the strap rings fit nicely.  No complaints here.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this watch for anyone looking for an elegant, accurate, well-made timepiece.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|This is, of course, a hugely fun read, as it has been for countless readers for over a century, but in this Kindle edition, at the beginning of every chapter it lists all of the illustrations that should accompany each chapter and none of them are visible. I thought that perhaps I there was a choice that I missed in the download and went back, but I didn't see anything. If I HAVE missed some way to see them, I would appreciate being enlightened. It would have gotten five stars without that problem.
1250012570|5.0|Not fair. I'm still recovering emotionally from John Green's Hazel and Augustus from \\"The Fault is in Our Stars\\". Then Rainbow Rowell goes and introduces me to Eleanor and Park. I'm not sure how much more my heart can hold!<br /><br />Having experienced adolescent first love, there's really nothing poetic about it. It's awkward. All those hormones rushing about and bodies changing. Just a mess. But when you add in social circumstances that heavily weigh the scales to the \\"sometimes life really hands out bad stuff\\" side of things, love can get complicated. Eleanor and Park are about as far apart as two people can be in most ways -- except they both are smart and have incredible hearts, with huge capacities, and untapped depths. The gentle unfolding of their friendship and love is a lovely thing to witness. The language of the novel is fluid, beautiful, and laced with imagery that makes the reader stop to pause to absorb it all. The story is told from alternating points of view of Eleanor, large, lumpy, colorful, living in an abusive family situation, and Park, half-Korean, passably popular, into alternative music, part of an close knit extended family.<br /><br />So much about this book struck home: the whole kids can be really cruel bit, sibling love and sibling rivalry, the awful things people do for love in bad relationships, and the beautiful, heartwarming ones done for love.<br /><br />If you've ever been fat, or short, or skinny, or had the wrong hair, or wore red shoes that the other kids laughed at, or were the new kid, or wore clothes that weren't the current fashion but not because you wanted to or even knew the difference, or were not the usual in any way, you'll be able to identify with \\"Big Red\\" as she struggles to find a place in a new school, where the only faces who smile back are those on the edge of the crowd, too.<br /><br />I seriously loved this book.<br /><br />Here's a link to a NYT review by John Green. Yes, the same one who broke my heart and made me cry over Hazel and Gus. [...]
0674048849|4.0|Well, who isn't an Austen fanatic? But really, a lot of the annotations are, as another reviewer points out, shallow. Do we need a full-page illustration of a strawberry plant, for example? The book is big and cumbersome--not nice to have all that weight on your midsection (or wherever) if you're reading in bed, and a pain to carry around. If you truly are a fanatic, you'll have to have this. If you just want to read the novel, find a lighter edition!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. All the actors are wonderful and the story is so captivating. Enjoy watching every Sunday. Can't wait for season 4.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to admit, I wasn't so sure about this book to begin with, even with many people I know saying how much they enjoyed this.  But, about 10 pages in, I was absolutely hooked...science fiction has never been quite as addictive and hard to put down as this one.  My review is short, since the book speaks for itself.  Well, well done book.
030759565X|5.0|I like to putter in the kitchen. I also like to putter on the computer. And thus, I found the Smitten Kitchen blog. It has been a favorite place to visit since the early days of the blog. Deb's perspective on life, small NYC kitchens, motherhood, and above all good food prepared with good ingredients is wonderful. Even though I've read the blog for years, and cooked many a meal either based on or inspired by one of her posts, and had many of her recipes in my overflowing file and cooking repertoire, and even though we're giving away, selling, donating possessions by the gazillion, when this book came out, I HAD to buy it. The recipes are great, the photographs gorgeous. It is a good book for the inexperienced cook to learn to branch out, and a good book from the experienced cook to cull new ideas and inspirations. Thank you, Deb. Here's to many more years of eating, reading, cooking, and delight.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|I’m confused about these other reviews.  I decided to save about $80 and purchased this less expensive monitor arm based on the highly rated reviews I read.  The reality is that I cannot tilt the angle of the monitor. If I want to change the angle of the monitor slightly up or down based on say, a sunbeam a certain time of day, the tool has to be used to loosen and then retighten the screw or the monitor flops.  In order to raise or lower the height of the monitor, I have to stand up and physically press in the node between the two joints to set the height.  The swinging ability left to right is good. The forward to backward is stiff.  If I loosen the screw to make this easier, there’s very little play between too tight and too lose. I need the ability to swing the arm several times a day from my viewing seated behind a desk to a customer’s viewing in the seat across from my desk which may require height lowering or raising, monitor tilting, and forward and backward movement. The cable management isn’t very elegant but the arm itself is stable and attractive. If you want your monitor off of your desk and don’t need much movement, this may be for you. I’m returning it and purchasing the LX Desk Mount LCD Arm by Ergotron.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I love this show!!! It is so funny! I watch the new episodes every week and had forgotten how funny some o fthe old ones were. Highly recommend.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the most creatively written mysteries I have read. At times laugh-out-loud funny, there is never a dull moment, and the pages turn quickly. You will wish you hadn't finished!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good mystery book and current with many subjects in the headlines today. Warning - serious subject and book.  Not very uplifting but well written.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I wish I could put into words how much I loved this book.  But for the life of me, every adjective falls flat.  I am not embarassed to say that I had actual tears streaming down my face as I neared the end of this tale.  The tears came not from plot (no spoilers here) but from the sheer sadness of having to step away from these characters. I didn't want it to end.  To me, this book will be a classic.  I hope to purchase it someday in a leather bound edition with artwork etc.  Then I will proudly reread it over and over and over.....
B00867GHS8|5.0|Funniest movie!  All ages will enjoy!  The creativity of these people writing and making this movie is dumbfounding!  How do they come up with this stuff!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Great album! Every song is good. My daughter and I listen to it all the time! Love that he writes his own music. Looking forward to hearing more from him.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I am so glad I got this for my husband's new Kindle Fire 7&#34;! I've seen it hit the floor more than a few times already... he forgets he hasn't zipped his back pack closed, yanks it up off the table, and there goes his Kindle. This lightweight case packs a lot of cushioning power in it's clever design. That brown strip is also a handle. The zipper works very smoothly. It resembles a day planner,  which makes it less of a target for thieves. It's very easy to use, and a fanny pack strap slides under the handle for hiking trips... making it as accessible as the binoculars around his neck when he wants to check a picture in a field guide!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The movie was well put together and suspense filled.  Did not seem to stall at points like some movies at certain points.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|*Please note that this is copied over from my UK Amazon account and may show up twice, sorry. But wanted to make sure Roy gets his glory.*<br /><br />I absolutely loved this story and my heart was pounding through my chest at the end, poor Dante! It is fast paced and the crossing over into another world exciting and intriguing. The author has created an excellent read for the YA genre, but without making you feel like you were too old reading it. Enjoyable plot, great characters and amazing picture building through imaginative description. Two thumbs up and a total recommend to fantasy fans of any age. Left me wanting more.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It was light hearted and funny. It was a nice change from the more serious adventurous mystery type books. I loved it.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|This app is really glitchy with the Kindle Fire HD. I can only assume it's the Silk browser that seems to be so incompatible with so many applications.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus Edition was gripping from the very start.  Futuristic sci fi is not my normal genre but after the review in The Herald Tribune, it was a must try.  Well,it has been a very long time since I couldn't put down a book.  Hue Howey is a master.  The characters come to life in a world so different and unknown to us.  The plot grabs you and keeps the pages turning to discover what happens.  Please continue this series, we want to hear more about life in the Silos.  Thanks for a most wonderful read !!!!!

1451695195|5.0|I have this book but I also have the CD and have heard the author's own voice talking about his experience.  I cannot begin to describe how fantastic this book is.  Do yourself a favor and get some version of it - CD, book, or Kindle version.<br /><br />I have read many books over the years re NDEs and all were enlightening and fascinating but this one goes more into the science of proof of life after death, call it heave or whatever you wish.<br /><br />Even if you don't believe such stuff or you believe heaven or an after life is only open to those who have a particular religion but not others, try this one for size and if you still call this book unreal, made up, stupid or a waste of time, have a nice day and a nice life anyhow.  But as for me, I am still amazed and dazed and I can't tell you how much more I am enjoying life now that I have over and over again seen that this is only one part of our story here on earth as humans.  We go on and if that isn't a great message, I don't know what is.

B00BI5IXL4|5.0|The cast was perfect, the story is a classic, and It is every bit as good as the version with Liam Neeson ...
1451683405|3.0|This book begins similarly to his other book, &#34;the end of faith,&#34; in which Harris describes some terrible atrocity that is designed to make the reader so shocked that they're stunned into reading more. IMO, this kind of ploy is cheesy... Also, Harris' writing comes off as rude, even if he is talking about an interesting subject. He presents everything as an argument, even if he's writing to an audience already open to his ideas. For that reason, I didn't mind that the book was so short.<br />Really though, it's a handy little book on free will and determinism, and for that I'll give it 3 stars. I wish Sam would have touched more on the subjects that came up during his radio interviews for the book (such as how democrats, when compared to republicans, already show signs of accepting determinism to a certain degree.) Maybe he'll expand on this one in a companion piece some day...
006220629X|5.0|I have spent the last few weeks immersed in a world created by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.  The Prisoner of Heaven is the third book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series.  As I write this I am listening to music from the book that Zafon has on his website, it is so beautiful and calming that you should listen to it while you read my book review.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon is one of my top ten favorite reads of all time. I have fond memories of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books hidden underneath Barcelona and I long to visit the place in my mind again and again. In fact when I was reading it I slept with the book under my pillow so I would dream about the world in which I was reading about.  It was truly one of my most memorable and meaningful reading experiences.<br /><br />Last week I finished reading the second book in the series The Angel's Game, which really takes place in time before the Shadow of the Wind.  When I finished The Angel's Game, I immediately began reading The Prisoner of Heaven and while it is a book that can easily stand alone, it is a book that ties the other two books together and connects the dots.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven is a literature lover's dream of what a good story is.  It takes place in Barcelona, this time in 1957 at Christmas.  Daniel Sempere is all grown up and married with a child.  His father Senor Sempere, owner of the independently owned bookstore, Sempere & Son, is aging.  Three generations of the Sempere & Son are in the pages of Zafon's books.  Fermin, Daniel's best friend wants to get married but a man from his past has shown up to collect a debt and Fermin is so anxious he can't eat.  Daniel decides he must help him but first Fermin must tell him the story of his past, a past that is too horrific to recount.<br /><br />Thus Zafon takes his readers on a mysterious adventure into the life of prison under Franko's dictatorship in the 1940's.  As Daniel makes connections to his past and to his deceased mother, the reader makes connections to the other two books.  Zafon leaves a surprise for us at the end when he leaves the door open for another book and another visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.  Yes!<br /><br />Frankly I am sad to be leaving this creative world of Zafon's and am simply begging him to write more books for me, his biggest fan.  Truly, this isn't a book review, it is a love letter to Zafon.<br /><br />The Cemetery of Forgotten Books trilogy is majestic, gothic, dark, romantic and all kinds of cool adjectives.  Enter this enchanting world, if you dare.  Frankly I don't know how you could resist.<br /><br />\\"In my experience, whenever someone discovered that place (the cemetery of forgotten books), Their reaction was always one of bewitchment and amazement.  The beauty and the mystery of the premises reduced the visitor to a silent, dream-like contemplation.  Naturally, Fermin had to be different.  He spent the first half hour hypnotized, wandering like a man possessed through every nook and cranny of the large jigsaw formed by the winding labyrinth of books\\" pg.265ceased mother, the reader makes connections to the other two books.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I am just about finished reading this book.It captured OCD perfectly.It is a very good book and keeps you in suspense.This was a Target bookclub book. I have read several selections of Target book club books and haven't been disappointed.It was slow in the beginning and confusing because it would go from the present to the past. But I quickly got use to it and couldn't put the book down.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm a reasonably consistent user of the iPhone under the premise that one wants to honor form over function. At the end of the day, I just want to get things done and see what's going on.  However, as of late the iPhone and Facebook have been at odds.  Trying to load Facebook on the iPhone requires going to make a sandwich while it loads.  The Kindle version of the FB app is a totally different world.  Loading FB updates on Kindle HD is wonderfully satisfying.  Fast.  HD.  Completely brilliant.  I get up and walk across the room to get the Kindle even though my iPhone is right next to me.  If you want Facebook, you want the Kindle HD.  Night and day.  And the night... is very dark.  Very dark indeed.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|Not as good as Amityville Horror but if you like this type of movie you might like it...it was a bit predictable...not one of my favs
B000FA675C|4.0|After a slow start, the action picks up and the story flies. The writing is pedestrian, the beginning is slow, the church history somewhat exaggerated (but basically on the mark), and the story starts slow, but once it gets going, it flies along.

B0053KWDES|5.0|I order though Amazon it came right on time and in bubble wrap well protected. The sound which is why you buy this is a big improvement so much so that I dont think I can every listen to my devises again with out it. I have been waiting for something like this since I went away from the big expensive sound systems of the 70's and 80's. I was never really happy with the quality of sound coming from my iDevises so I upgrade to the highest quality ear buds but still though I could get more. This is it I now have the sound quality I have been looking for. The size works best for my iphone it is bigger than the Nano and the rubber straps are a bit big for the Nano. Having the rubber straps on the iPhone is a pain to work around the touch screen but it is still a good way to carry this maybe velcro would work too.This my first FiiO device I would by another. This looks great and fits the look of my black iphone. It is lighter than I though so easy to carry with you. Once it is on your phone it is a lot for your pocket but does just fit. I give it 5 stars even though they could have added smaller straps for the small devises. The rechargeable battery and charger may not even be needed the battery states it last 10 hours. The price with this kit gives you all the extras for free so nothing to complain about. Get one if you need high quality sound in your head you will love this.

I think a big problem with most diets is you look ahead and are overwhelmed by the fact you'll be starving for months and you just give up. On this plan, it may be a little difficult on your fast day, but just knowing you get to eat what you want the next day gives you the motivation to push through. It also gets easier as you go. The reason I wanted to write this review though isn't so much about the weight loss, but the other benefits that I've experienced. I have suffered from horrible headaches and mood problems the week before my period since I was a teen (I'm now 45). For the first time in years, i haven't had the headaches AND my husband actually wants to be around me even around &#34;that time&#34; of the month. I also have more energy and just an all around more positive attitude in general. I know the diet is simple and yes you could do it without buying the book, but it helps explain the science behind it, and gives helpful tips and menu plans as well.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|love playing this game. everyone in the house loves this game they compete to see who can get the next shark. I recommend downloading this.
B000FA675C|5.0|I've wanted to read this book for a while and finally got a chance when the publisher released free e-books as a way to promote the author's new novel. It's definitely in my top 10 books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent segue from book 1 to book 2. Cannot wait to read book 3 although I have heard it is not as good as the first 2 books.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I was introduced to Adele via Pandora and heard about half this album that way, so I decided to buy it, and I was not disappointed. It's really fun music, especially if you have to drive a long distance. The only track I'm not a huge fan of is the cover she did of Lovesong, but it's not terrible; it's just really 'loungy' sounding to me and I don't particularly care for the way she sings it. Personal preference is all. Otherwise, a great album.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game.  I anticipate the noises.  I have also been known to play in my sleep!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Was looking for flashlight app, overwhelmed by sheer number available. Asked a few friends what app they used, none could remember.  So ended up setting a filtered search based on free and minimum 4-5 stars. I got really lucky with this app!  Fast and easy download, totally easy to understand how to use, and BRIGHT!!!!  I found this flashlight app to be brighter than my handheld mag light!  My work hours mean that I have to be outside in the dark when I get off-I'm really happy that I no longer carry the weight of a regular flashlight in my purse and at the same time I can see better at night now than ever before

B00BSBXZDY|4.0|better than expected.  Why do you put a requirement on word count.  Can't we be brief and terse, but still have an opinion?  Makes me tend to not rate because of that...
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game I can never put it down and I deffinitly cant get my brother to put it down.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE LOTR FOR THIS. LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT THOUGH; THIS IS RELATED TO LOTR BUT IT WAS NOT WRITTEN  TO BE THE SAME AS LOTR AND SO THERE IS NO FAIR COMPARISON. IF YOU MUST COMPARE IT WITH ANYTHING, COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER MOVIE VERSION OF &#34;THE HOBBIT&#34;  AND YOU WILL SEE HOW GREAT IT IS. ALSO, THIS IS PART ONE OF THREE SO DON'T EXPECT ANY PLOT LINES TO BE RESOLVED AT THE END BECAUSE IT IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.
B000FA675C|5.0|fascinating blending of church history with modern themes.  Includes, suspense, love story, devout faith, biblical exegesis, geography and historic buildings
B004FQX59I|1.0|Please know that Stone has perpetrated one of the biggest frauds in movie history (which is saying a lot).  While he admits he took creative license, this film glosses over the following FACTS and replaces them with Stone's politically correct conspiracy babble.  I will list several... there are several hundred if one cares to think and read.<br /><br />Far from the hero do-gooder that Jim Garrison is portrayed as (and that Kevin Costner so often plays), Jim Garrison was a sleazy DA who had NO case or evidence and fabricated one by putting the muscle on a few people to lie for him.  Why... to grab his moment of fame in an otherwise very forgettable career.<br /><br />He targeted and destroyed the reputation and life of Clay Shaw.  Shaw was a private, successful, gay man who did a lot for charities in New Orleans.  He had as much to do with JFK as your do or I do.  Garrison felt no qualms about ruining this man's life and impoverishing him (legal bills) just to grab headlines that were later proven to be baseless.  Garrison is magically transformed into Stone's hero and mouthpiece for distorting the mountain of evidence against Oswald and only Oswald.<br /><br />Oswald was a wife-beating, ex-marine marksman (the shot he made were easy with a rifle and a magnifying scope and a target moving slowing away from him).  The only reason he coincidentally worked at the Texas School Book Depository was that a friend of his wife felt sorry for her since Oswald was consistently unable to hold a job and she knew the TSBP was hiring.  He got the job weeks or months before Kennedy first thought of going to Dallas, therefore Oswald being set up with his sniper nest was coincidence.  Oswald also attempted the assassination of a right-wing Dallas politician by firing the same gun into the man's window (bullet deflecting off the window pane wood, thus the man was not hit).  Oswald hated the USA where he was a failure and a loner, so he tried the USSR and quickly wore out his welcome as the Soviets quickly realized he was mentally unstable, had no info they needed, and was totally unsuited to work for an organization such as the KGB.  Oswald left the USSR (they were happy to see him leave) and then he returned to the USA expecting much fanfare about his importance... there was little/none (sadly our CIA and FBI should have known this nut with a gun was on the parade route in Dallas).  He also tried to move to Cuba but was refused by the Cubans.  On the day he killed Kennedy he drove to work with a coworker carrying a very long, thin package that he said was \\"curtain rods\\"... this was the murder weapon.  His finger and palm prints were on the rifle. The bullets match his (including the non-magical one that went through Kennedy's neck into Governor Connolly).  After killing Kennedy he left the building, took a bus, walked to his house, changed clothes, grabbed a handgun he owned, walked out and when confronted killed a police officer in front of eye witnesses, then tried to hide in a movie theatre despite several witnesses following his movements and was caught and interrogated.... now if some evil conspiracists were behind Oswald, why didn't they kill him to shut him up immediately when they had all these chances???<br /><br />I'll stop.  Nobody can know 100% of everything about this case.  Perhaps I am wrong and there was some conspiracy... but I currently have no reasonable doubt that Oswald acted alone.  I encourage anyone to read the Warren Commission Report, some conspiracy books, and also Gerald Posner's \\"Case Closed.\\"  I read all these, originally thinking there had to be a conspiracy.  I just know with 100% certainty that the movie JFK is packed with lies that Oliver Stone justifies as creative license.  He is a Houdini in that he has so many people fooled.  Sadly, Stone's props are not magic boxes and chains, they are the history of a beloved president, and the damage he has done to the truth is shameful, just as shameful as the actions of his \\"hero\\" Jim Garrison.  Hmmm... interesting connection....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway run is the best game i have played so far. And i cant just stop playing it. Thumps up all the way!!!
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Long and drawn out, it was all during the war, not so much of his life as I thought. Very dissappointing.
B0053O89RY|5.0|...the quality of the writing seems to have dropped off coonsiderably. The acting is definitely solid, but it's not as funny as the 1st season. Still like it and watch it all the time.
B0037WP83M|5.0|It is a great movie and the trilogy is awesome. It is hard to find a good movie to watch these days that has substance.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Truly enjoyed this movie, kept me on the edge of my seat till the final minutes. Great actors, acting, and characters. Nice to see the honesty with torture technics used to gather intelligence.<br />A movie I will definitely add to my home collection.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's fun, keeps you on your toes, you have to be fast.First two times you are trying to find as many as you can, then next the clock is ticking, you can't find as many then.
0778328821|5.0|I love the way Debbie Macomber writes. I have finished the Cedar Cove series and I look forward to meeting the people on Blossom Street.<br /><br />I tell people who ask what I am reading, about how much I enjoy Debbie's books. I look forward to watching the TV series that Hallmark has made out of Mrs Macomber's books.
B00005JKDR|5.0|My four yr old loves this movie and I enjoy watching it with her.  Very cute characters and alot of adventures.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I had a hard time staying with the story for about half the book.  There are so many characters that I had difficulty remembering who they were and trying to keep things straight.  Then things got interesting.  Loved the rest of the book.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Another great movie and the bonus features are rather interesting as well. Just to see the work going into making the movie gives you more of an appreciation of it. Favorite villain is the white Orc. Whomever designed the body movement and facial expressions and personality did a very good job!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like the game. it is so easy to play. I play it while at home or at work.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case exceeded my expectations in color and sturdiness! I am completely happy with this purchase. The Kindle HD fits well into it without snapping out and I can hold it upright in my lap as was shown in the picture before purchasing it. I recommend this case. It is a great case at a great price!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I found that the Hungry Shark Evolution was pretty hard to play. I cancelled the game on my kindle. I'll try easier games. Thanks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is awesome and easy to use. I use to have a galaxy S for that was the same as this one. When I switched to a Nexus that uses stock android, the calculator was horrible. What I never understood is it has the option to clear your history, but there's no option to look at your history. That's so stupid. Lol. Anyways I'm glad for this app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesome Game. Best mystery game. I have. ever played. Check it out or else I love it play it now
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the book, and all Dan Brown books, they keep you on edge from beginning to end, the stories are all plausible.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I'm not a fan of network television, but Walking Dead breaks the norm!  In my opinion, it should be a little cheaper, maybe $0.99 / episode, considering it's only a 45 min network television show
B0078XGEK2|5.0|The Road Less Traveled is a profound and practical guide to living life fully. The information is approachable and the techniques simple and easily applied to ones life; My experience of life has been completely altered.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is honestly a great read! It gives you chills at times, but it defiantly relates to the teens in our century. I would suggest this book to anyone. I am so glade my English teacher choose this book to read. I defiantly found myself buried in the book, wanting more!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The only thing I don't like it uses a lot of memory.  Other than that it is really worth having.
B0058BI896|4.0|The character Penny makes this show worth watching. Some of the humor is a little over the top...typical of working around engineering types.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series was wonderful to watch and I am eager to see Season 3, after enjoying 1 and 2 so much.  The characters are so interesting and the stories always ring true to me.
B007KOMTUI|3.0|Used to love this series, I think it's running out of steam.  Past seasons well balanced without any political agenda that I could see. Now we have to bring in the holocaust ?  Stick that tired old topic onto a very popular series ?
B006885FZI|4.0|A bit predictable, but that's not to say the writing is bad--it's actually quite strong.  The acting makes up for it, anyway.  Very strong characters.<br /><br />At 4.99 or 3.99 an episode made it a little expensive to watch.  Had to pick and choose episodes.  Did not see them all.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The main character, emotionally damaged from 18 years of foster care that was often abusive,  finds a way to a more healthy outlook via the meaning behind flower species.  The dual story of living with her last foster mother as a pre-teen and her life after leaving a group home at the age of 18 was well told.  Often very touching, with a satisfying ending that stays true to her emotional maturity.
B000FA675C|4.0|I was very pleased overall with the book. I only got this book because I seen the movie and wanted to read the book because there is always more.<br /><br />I have to say I was very happy with my decision.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|The characters were cast  like robin hood types in which the writers attempted to justifying stealing, robbing and prostitution for a living. I would of preferred a more Back to the Future, Star Trek type plots. But it was entertainment.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I fel asif I were walking with her along the CRT. Her disomfort, fears, joys and challenges were so real.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|BORING AND LAIM put it in something like a book that is boss put someone in the  book named bob
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Entertaining but I found it a bit disjointed. Obvioiusly a sad story with the tragic ending after the book was out with Chris being killed by one he was trying to help!!
1423140591|5.0|My granddaughter is an 11 year old avid reader.  She is attacking the Percy Jackson series at the moment.  This book gave her moments of laughter and moments of crying.  It kept her attention from beginning to end and she says it was better than chocolate.  For her that is the highest of praise.  She ran to get the next book in the series as soon as she finished this.  I expect if you have a teen/tween lover of books, they would enjoy this - both boys and girls.
B003YUCRFE|4.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story of The Hound of the Baskervilles is still a very good read. Am currently on my third time through the book. Admittedly if you don't appreciate Doyle's style of writing you may not enjoy it, but the book is a very good study in using one's thought processes to analyze situations, clues and progress as you go along. Purchased and downloaded from Amazon means having it on my Kindle Fire so I can enjoy it any time.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book is the kind the build you up and makes everything in life look clearer. You fall in love with life while reading this. And it leaves with with the big gaping hole of heartbreak when it's over.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|it will sharpen a dull knife, but not surgically sharp. It would be good for those of us that carry a pocket knife and use it regularly. This will do the job for you.
1441965904|5.0|This is the first book I have come across that really addresses the needs of non-native speakers.<br />It gives simple-to-follow rules on aspects that will significantly help Spanish presenters to:<br /><br />i) avoid errors in English by using short simple sentences<br />ii) improve their English pronunciation<br />iii) write less text on their slides and thus make less mistakes with their English<br />iv) answer audience questions without fear and embarrassment (it also tells the reader what to do if they don't understand the questions)<br />v) learn standard phrases for use in all the various stages of a presentation.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Movie was pretty good and more understanding than we<br />can catch on.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis was a perfect pick for the portrayal<br />of Abe Lincoln. Looks eerily like him, though!<br /><br />This movie had an all-star studded cast that I never<br />thought I would see helmed by Spielberg who made the movie.<br /><br />4 out of 4 stars, indeed! but Amazon does 5 stars LOL<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very good show. Not your typical drama for television. CBS really hit it out of the park with this one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is the second book I have read that gave me a twist at the end that I did not expect.<br />I liked his literary style. As a parent I probably would go in the same direction he did.
B0038AUYKU|5.0|This book was one of Mantels best Wallender books because Kurt was in it all the way through as opposed to the South African book An excellent read
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great to play. it passes time.but the one thing I regret is that games take a long time to get.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|it's not perfect, but then again nothing is. it does work but eBay left oit some key features such as contacting the buyer or seller and other feature that I don't have to to list.
B008602KQI|2.0|I'm sure the books were better, but the movie was just dumb.  I wouldn't waste my money on watching this, but I would watch it for free on Amazon Prime
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Absolutely awesome movie for the entire family! We loved it as much as our children. Raul Dahl is phenomenal. This classic book is brought to the screen in a very well done manner.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I sat with my mouth open at the end . Exciting, could not put book down.<br />I recommend it highly. My emotions ran from one direction to another
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey's attention to detail and character development are outstanding. If you want believable, gripping, human science fiction this is the book for you. Amazing!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Love this case, very happy with the results and fit.<br />It made my kindle look more professional.<br />I enjoy traveling with this case knowing that its protected.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great for kids and people that get so into games it is fun to try and beat your high score
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's one of those books you can't put down.  The characters are real and you understand every one of them.  Even the bad people.  Nicholas Sparks who wrote the Notebook and Message in a bottle is a wonderful story teller.  Read it you'll love it.
B000IYUIPK|3.0|\\"The Presidio\\" is a really good movie.  Well, that would be if it were a made-for-TV film, which I'm assuming that it wasn't.<br /><br />It's not the cast that's the problem.  Sean Connery is good, as usual.  And while I've been very hit-and-miss on Mark Harmon -- I hated his interpretation of Ted Bundy, and NCIS is absolutely unwatchable -- I think that he's pretty decent here.  Even Meg Ryan, who's been in quite a few completely overrated films -- \\"You've Got Mail,\\" anyone? -- doesn't completely stink here.<br /><br />But rather, I believe that it was the screenplay.  Mr. Connery and Mr. Harmon have somewhat of a love-hate relationship here, for at least a couple of reasons.  One guy hooking up with another guy's daughter might be one of them.  And this little \\"love triangle\\" is what's blasé for me; it seemed to be a cheap little plot device to try and bring some interest to the characters and their plights.<br /><br />I decided to watch this film because it was on \\"free\\" TV, it was in HD, I'd never seen it before, and it was set in San Francisco.  I lived in the city for a year and a half, and I still live very close and visit fairly often.  I wanted to see what SF looked like in the 80s, and I guess not much has changed really; steep hills, narrow houses, lots of fog.  And lots of mediocre films still get made there I suppose.<br /><br />Well, if you're really bored and you can watch this film for free, I'd perhaps give it a peek.  Just pretend that it's an Afterschool Special and maybe you won't be completely disappointed.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Love this movie, alot of action and guns and all lot of actors that I like, just need a better story
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I bought this movie for my kids ages 6,5 and 2. they love this movies and I feel in love with it too. great kid and family movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you don't have a kindle this is an easy way to read the books. its easy and quick to use not difficult at all!
1616550414|5.0|While i wasn't that big a fan at first on Skyward Sword, the last of the Zelda series, i have been a longtime fan of this entire franchise, and this book brought so many good memories of my previous gaming adventures with Link over the years, the character art, the stories behind each character and game, the history of the legacy of every adventure link had faced, and to top it off, a great mini comic to get hooked for the new skyward sword game made this so worth every penny! however, if you are buying it online, due remember that the packaging may have a chance of wear and minor tear on the cover's binding, but otherwise it's still a good pricing for such a good product! if you truly, and i mean TRULY if you have been either a longtime fan of the entire Zelda series, or Just a newcomer, everything in this book will help either catch up to speed with this game's franchise, or Take you back to Hyrule's memory lane.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|I thad some get ideas. Easy read will probable read again for better content understanding. I would recommend it  for individual strugling with getting ideas over to co-worker, supervisors and spouses.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I usually pass on the space science fiction works but this one is exceptional.  Andy Weir has created a believable, intense and sometimes funny techno-thriller that is simply a must read.  I defy you to read the first 3 or 4 pages and then set this book aside.  You can't!  Andy, this was an  outstanding reading experience; can't wait to read more of your works.
B0029P63Q4|5.0|Awesome songs and quality.<br />I have the CD but. Have the MP3 and make it available neither on the car or on the plane is the best.
B00003CX5P|5.0|My son watches this movie over and over. great for all ages. I'm glad I bought it. My husband also loves the movie
0765325950|5.0|I pre-order this book and received my copy on January 8th. However, I couldn't bring myself to start the book (for more than three months). My hubby didn't understand... But, I had a hard time starting something that would end a story that I've followed for the past 20 years.<br /><br />This review contains no real spoilers (especially since I have yet to actually finish it - I'm on page 797 of 909). However, while reading just now, I realized that I'm ready and able to write my review now... as in put the book down and write the review RIGHT now sort of now.<br /><br />I'm in the chapter titled \\"The Last Battle\\" (which, BTW, is 190 pages long!) and I read with tears streaming down my face. I feel like I'm losing close friends... friends that I've had for the past twenty years or so. I find myself completely immersed in the story. For me, both are signs of a good book. Now I'm having the opposite trouble. The book that I had trouble wanting to start, I now have trouble wanting to put down.<br /><br />Whatever the ending, I know that I will soon re-read the whole series again... and again... And I will eventually get my sons to read the series also (currently ages 6 and 8).<br /><br />If you have yet to read these books, I definitely recommend that you do so.<br /><br />---------- ---------- ---------- ----------<br /><br />Finished... 23 years... 11,916 pages... 4,056,130 words... I can't even begin to estimate the number of hours spent reading and rereading this series.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was an ending...
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|I could not say how great this cd is. better then the last. It reminds me why I have love OMD for all these years. If your a fan, dont pass this cd up. I have to say I love all the songs on here, no filler, it flows and its a great 12 song cd. It leaves you with wanting more. I was so impressed, thanks OMD for the great cd. cant wait for the next one. Song that are my favs, metroland, will be silent, helen of troy, kissing the machine, dresden. not a bad song. buy this cd.
B006MPKAOI|4.0|An excellent story, although at the start it felt a bit disjointed, once I got used to the writers style it was amazing. Really difficult to put it down.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Lighthearted, witty, and real. Each character is unique and adds an equal weight to the show-- all are funny. My favorite show!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|This is truly a work of art. If you like the saxophone this CD is for you. Van Is back with a vengeance! Not just one song but the whole disc. It was really exciting hearing it for the first time and even more hearing it over and over!!
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This really is a great movie. I don't know why people didn't see it when it came out. It's the story of a man(Richard Gere) who finds a dog at the train station & brings him home. The dog grows to be a true part of the family. He always follows him to the station & then comes back at 5:00 to meet him. I won't give away anything else cause you really have to see it. IT's based on a true story. Check it out, you'll love it!
B00BJ9VBLI|2.0|This game was quite boring! It was no fun and I am happy I did not purchase the full version.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am really enjoying the season and was glad to find season 3 on Amazon at a good price.  The audio and video quality is good.  I am very glad that I purchased the season so that I can watch at my leisure.

B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I've always enjoyed the dash games. Helps past the time when I'm at work. Only because I need more words.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Will definitely read more from her!  Couldn't put it down.  Would make a fantastic film. Happy to have found it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have never watched this show before, but my husband got me to watch one episode and I was hooked.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|This game is fun and fast paced.  A good little time waster with an interesting sound track.  Lots of fun innuendos as well hidden with in.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I really like this product. The only problem I have is that the DVD box looked rough. The disc look good though.
B005ZOCF5E|3.0|Could not get into the story till about 3/4 of the story. The main character is a person you couldn't`t eve feel sorry for. The other main character, his sister, was more interesting. This story was absolutely boring right up to the last few chapters. Defiantly a story
B000OBYLVO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I bought it for my Kindle Fire to watch whenever I want.  In today's world it truly hits home about what is important and what is not.  All of the primary characters are great and Jude Law is wonderful to look at...lol.  Enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!  It's so fun and addicting once you start you can't start playing it it's fun and very easy to play.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Liked the book,  it was interesting and easy to read.  It held my interest from begining to end.  Will purchase the rest.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a wonderful movie. Definitely a must see. Well directed and well acted. Definitely deserved the nominations it received.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It's pretty handy on my tablet (Samsung Tab 2 10.1). It provides a lot of fairly detailed information, particularly with the hourly forecast.
0525953728|4.0|[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]<br />I believe my title of this review says it all. This is a very quick read that I did enjoy and found entertaining. It seems that most every book I have read involving Navy Seals spends almost half the book on their training. Truly, the SEALS training is impressive and I have a great deal of respect for each and every individual that even attempts to qualify for this elite program. However, if you have read some of these books already its a little frustrating to read again. Also, the bravery of these men that went on the mission is mind blowing and again they have my full respect and appreciation. My only personal issue was that I had seen Mark Owen on the television show 60 minutes and this book just put to writing the actual events he described almost word for word. So only to that end do I lower the rating by one star. I can recommend this book, if one has no other knowledge of the events and it truly is entertaining.
0345472322|4.0|Mindset is something everyone should have a look at. The author looks at the fixed mindset and the open mindset, going into detail how each works in many different environments.  The down side of the book is that it tends to repeat the same concept over and over. Perhaps that may be a good thong though.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It is easy to use and has crisp, precise notes.  Good for anyone - beginner or expert alike.  Try it.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I bought this movie to put in my son's Easter basket.  We had seen it in theaters and enjoyed it then.  It was a must have for his DVD collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a long time since I have picked up a book that I didn't want to put down.  I was almost sad at the end. So much more to tell!  Can't wait to start Shift.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|Along with its excellent transfer of the Panavision original, This Blu-ray reissue is a smashing bargain. The picture is fine, the multi-channel DTS sound is superb and the story is gripping and enjoyable. Good special features. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Avoid its sequel, Futureworld, a fairly good story badly transferred..
B005SV9X22|5.0|I was shopping for a birthday gift. She had said she liked lady gaga.  Purchased this item and know its on the DVD in the kitchen playing on the tv every time I go for get togethers..... She loves it.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|A futuristic kind of a movie, gory as has a lot of young adults trying to kill each other to win games, I would agree that it was an average thriller but the whole concept was pretty twisted. In the end someone has to win the game.
B003VANOFY|5.0|[[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]]<br /><br />I got this for $96.74 and it is worth it. The sound is great and the 7.1 surround sound option mode is awesome. It comes with six free voice mods that are cool and fun to use.  The battery life on it for wireless is okay, it last for me about 3-5 hours on fully charged.  The range is good, I can walk into the kitchen and still hear sounds. I would recommend someone to buy this product.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I bought this game to play with my 6 year old.  He loves playing Lego games but this one is a little tough for him to translate the image to Lego blocks in his mind so I have to help him a lot.  It's definitely a game we will have around for a while as he learns to play the game.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|This movie, directed by Ron Howard, is really, really good.  I saw it when it first came out and took my son to see it. I bought it now for my grandsons to see.  It's a story that takes place in a magic world with fairies, brownies, little people and other fantasy monsters.  It would be a little intense for very young children, but entertaining for 9 year olds and older.  It has all the requirements for a good story-a trek, an evil queen, unlikely heroes and magic.  All in all, it is one of my all time favorites.
B008B4KVS8|4.0|The blu-ray edition of Ice Station Zebra takes full advantage of the quality inherent in its large-film format. It's a good thriller, worthwhile.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read In a LONG time I shows you the soldiers point of view and sorry for my grammar  I am on  a kindle fire but yes 5 stars I love this book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game I ever played me and my mom go at it. But why don't they add new stuff I know they added the keys but like New power ups.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is an interesting game that allows you to rotate the cube so you can match the cubes from different sides.  There are enough different designs (and ones that look alike) to keep this from being boring if you play continuously.  The cubes are just the right size so you can tap on them quickly to beat the clock.  Very entertaining!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This film makes you think about human nature, and our relationship with our animal friends..loved it. Great twist at the end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Mr. Green's comedic writing is what drew me in. The main character is sarcastic and whitty, as are all of the characters the further you read. This story is about an unfortunate and sad situation and it really makes you appreciate your own life. Mr. Green has woven a story that's full of depth and honesty. One reason I like this book so much is because of how different the plot is and how different the characters are. You feel like you want to be friends with all of them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I did not like the ending, but that was the actors choice.  Really enjoy seeing the family evolve along with the changing times.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore uses humor to point out the deficiencies of America's health care system and how smaller and less affluent countries can provide good health care for its citizens.  He sure makes you think!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|easily the best game of this type. good graphics good game play no supper long wait times for builds fun game get it
B00002N9ER|5.0|Since running with local Fire Police squad, I no longer have flash lights rolling around in truck. Will be back to purchase more for our squad. Thank you for selling your item on Amazon.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I've only been using this for a few days now but I couldn't be happier with it!  It's so easy to follow the videos and I love that they change up the exercises each day.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've now been using the app for over a month and it has made a HUGE difference for me.  I have psoriatic arthritis and due to an injury about a year ago I had become way too sedentary and developed significant knee and hip pain which made it difficult to work out - it was a downward cycle that I just couldn't figure a way out of. When I saw the app I loved that it would allow me to do just 10 min because that's about all I can manage - but what a difference 10 min can make when its isometric exercises. Prior to starting the app I was needing loads of Advil and Tylenol 3 times a day for pain management and I'm now down to using it only once/day. AWESOME app!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all 9 episodes in 1 weekend.  The story is so intriguing and the clothes are simply gorgeous! How long do I have to wait for the next season?
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Plastic holder broke using it the second time in 1 day. Originally glued together very poorly. Good idea, but not for multiple uses.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore sure tells it like it is.  Michael Moore's America is my America.  Watch how he tells the truth about who really runs America.  Keep your liberal mind open.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I had no trouble setting it but I couldn't turn it off when it started ringing the next morning.  I assumed it would only require tapping the screen.  In fact I had to turn on the power to turn off the alarm!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love how detailed it is and so easy to use. It runs fast on my iPhone 5. Would highly recommend
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is fantastic!! Five stars for everything. I like how you can evolve your sharks and buy cute hats and such from the store. The graphics are great too, very detailed. I can't stop playing! Don't play unless you're ready to have this game take your soul!
0399101284|1.0|I have purchased many books that are rated &#34;Good&#34; which are great. This book should have been rated as &#34;Poor&#34; and cost 5 dollars less. The book had many signs of ware and the binding in bad shape. The book was even &#34;bent&#34; like it had been in a large pile of books which shaped it this way. Overall I’m very disappointed. Please, just be honest with the product description.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Good insights about education from a journalist.  The content is so important that I would have given it a &#34;5&#34; if he had come up with a more satisfactory solution.  He does a beautiful job pointing out the problems though.
0307352153|5.0|Author Susan Cain discusses as truly wonderful topic in her new book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking. By viewing introversion in like of the many magnificent discoveries and accomplishments made by introverts, Cain uncovers the true methods and practices of introversion. But Cain doesn't stop with just a intellectual discovery, she permeates social and very personal aspects as well.<br /><br />Instead of just discussing how introverts work, Cain provides a new societal regard towards introverts. She tells us that instead of seeing extroverts as superior, society must regard both introverts and extroverts as necessary in order to leverage the full potential of innovation, growth, and imagination that occurs when introverts and extroverts work in tandem.<br /><br />This is a truly brilliant book: stellar writing, piercing with truth, and innovating thinking. Just purely magnificent.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I didn't get the chance to see this on TV so I was fortunate not to have been disappointed when it was cancelled. But now it's available to watch over and over again. I love this cast and the story they put out. There's great chemistry between all the characters and it's highly entertaining.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|First time I ordered, the outside &#34;briefcase&#34; box was slightly torn, but we returned and reordered and all was great! It is an amazing show and the deal was great!
1609611543|5.0|since I went on the gluten-free diet I lost 10 lbs in a month!  My Dr. was very proud of me.  My cholestral was very good!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I realize that some of you are complaining about the lack of water and spawning stuff, if you want that stuff, get Pocketinveditor Pro[[ASIN:B009HN0V6E PocketInvEditor Pro]]. It is super cool. Anyway, this game is super fun. I don't play it on pc, too many annoying people, but this version is awesome!<br />UPDATE: 6/18/13<br />Also, for those people freaking out about the update, it came out, no need to blow your top. I saw a couple reviews that said that they couldn't log in to the realms thing. You have to use a Mojang account, not a Minecraft account. And I agree, I thought that there was no way to play local multiplayer, and this is completely Mojangs fault, but I just went on YouTube and looked up how to and if somebody else started the world, you click play and scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see, \\"world on WiFi\\" or something like that. If you don't see it, make sure you have local server multiplayer turned on, by the way that setting is located in the settings, on the first page.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book!  It kept you interested the whole time.  You never knew what was going to happen next. The ending could have been better.  Definitely worth reading.
B00B3HJMLM|4.0|This album definitely brought back some great college memories.. super fun!! Couple of songs that I could have done without, but overall love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Omg. I hate reading and this is the BEST book ever. I have never read so much in my life. Finished this book within a day <3
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Would like the levels to change instead of playing same old board over and over.make items better to get. Overall great game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Get light reading.  Kept you in suspense the whole time as well.  It definitely was a great love story. I never read a Nicholas Sparks novel before but definitely will read more of his works.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you like candy crush saga on Facebook, you will love this game.<br />And it's free, which makes it even better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool because it has like hundreds of games you should dealt download this game it is so cool I love it
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|How many people have already told you that The Hobbit is an incredible movie? Do you really need to hear it again? Ok, go watch it. (Maybe for the fortieth time in a month...)
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Great Book with a successful surprising ending. I absolutely  loved it and I would really recommend it to someone looking for a sad, well written book.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|After watching Sin City, I had to get the Unrated Collector's Edition. It made the best holiday gift set for my best friend.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This book was required for a business class, I half expected a boring business book but it's interesting and easy to read. Thanks
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this, really user friendly and its all there everything I need to know about the weather. Couldn't ask for an better app. Thank you
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This movie was like having bamboo shoved under my nails it will be 2 hours and 23 minutes of my life I cannot get back.  The acting from the main two characters was flat and emotionless.  Also for everyone to be hungry you always see everyone eating and while the people in these mysterious districts are supposed to be dirt poor they somehow can all afford to have the latest video technology in their homes.  Also I do not see why everyone in the capital city seem to want to dress like lady gaga knock offs.
B00003CXSM|4.0|As always, the Wedding Planner pleases with its combination of nerdy humor (I have never heard &#34;you smell like grilled cheese sandwiches&#34; in any chick flick before or after) and (also mostly nerdy) sweetness. Overall it's a good movie.
B000RF1QDS|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE - MY MOM , DAD AND I WATCHED IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT!!! I WILL BE WATCHING IT AGAIN SOON
B003G4W49C|5.0|You know the book is REALLY good when you actually dream about it in your sleep, you worry about the character when you're NOT reading, and find yourself feeling sad that you've finished reading it becausse it literally feels like you're walking away from someone you've fictionally gotten to know. This is how i feel about Ender's Game, a book i just so happened to randomly picked up at the local bookstore. It's become a story that i will remember for a very long time. Now the challenge is to pick up a new book. Who else has read such a book that it becomes hard to believe that there is anything better to read out there!? LOL!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Love her or hate her, the thing you want to see when you rent this movie, is the story of her life, her struggle, her politics and her career. This film is about little more than her mental decay before her death. I get the impression that the writer, director and the star all hated Margaret Thatcher and wanted to portray her is the dullest light possible. They could have done so much with it: the miners strike, the war with Argentina, the poll tax and the attempt on her life, the relationships with Gorbachev and with Reagan. No! They decided to have scene after scene of Mrs Thatcher talking to her dead husband. This is a bad movie and a stain on the career of Streep.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is very addictive.  I will sit there for hours and not realize how much time has passed.  Love, love. love it!  It might start causing problems in my marriage, though!
B00992CF6W|1.0|There is no minecarts no buckets no ender perls no serves I mostly like the pc version get everything that pc has and I'll rate more
0345803485|5.0|I've read a lot of books and a lot of romance novels, both before and since delving into this trilogy, and I have not found anything that comes close. I know it gets a bad rap for poor writing but I don't agree. Is it great American lit, no, but what romance novel can be picked apart for language use or such nuances as might be discussed in a lit class (maybe in a clit class, ha, ha)?  Is the writing poor, no way!  Great character development, great at showing not telling, great at plot ups and downs (pace). In my opinion, the book has little to do with the BDSM world or aspect, rather its just about the development of trust, intimacy and love between the two main characters. Enjoy!
B00845POUO|5.0|This was one of the most impactful movies I've seen in a long time.  My handsome Gerry did the most excellent job once again in this movie.......knowing this was a true story amazed me.  Someone doing such bad things and turning it around to do such good was inspiring.  Gerry is the best actor around I think.  You can see and feel his emotions of caring, anger, and confusion, hurt and heartache.  When he looks at Lynn at one point and says, Help me, it just broke me up,, you could see the pleading on his face..........There is nothing he can't accomplish in his acting career.....................look at all his movies and how he plays serious, comedy,  romantic (even when a bad guy),evil, villaneous, hero like,  and can also sing - did a wonderful job in Phantom............This movie was watched twice and I just bought it....and I will watch it over and over..........a most excellent film and actor/actors!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's not what you think. Just watch and you will see what I mean. You'll love it and keep comming back!!
B00BGZ8OLA|4.0|Chose 4 stars as this was a very enjoyable movie. It kept your attention and guessing.  I would reccommend this movie to anyone.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great flick and fun for all ages! I would definatly recomend this to any one who like adventures! And the Hd was worth it
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Once you start watching this show, you get hooked.  I love it!  I cannot wait to see what will happen next!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it is the best app ever thank you now that I have it I can do my math times better then ever
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game! It is very user friendly and fun. Fast paced if you want and I like the auto complete. I have yet to figure out the scoring but it is not important to me.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the best headphones ever for something lightweight and un-encumbersome. They fit your ears like nice earbuds, but stay on your head with the security of normal headphones, and all with Sony quality sound and portability.
B003DS3GC0|4.0|The story was very interesting as stories like this is now coming out to the public and I believe it should.  The story line was really good and the actors were excellent.<br />I liked the friendship they had and the trust they held for each other.  This shows how sick behavior of others affect peoples lives and in this case the lives of 4 mischiveous boys.<br /> I would reccommend this to others
B003MC5N28|4.0|It's a great book and its science fictiony. I suggest it for hunger games likers. It was very very good.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|This is a must for any Batman fan! I highly recommend it!  You will not be disappointed!  What are you waiting for?
B008602KQI|5.0|it was a pretty good story. i liked the whole visual aspect of it all. it got pretty intense as it progressed.
B0026O475M|5.0|This movie is kind of old but its a classic.  Tom Hanks is a good actor.  His plane crashes out in the ocean and he lives on a island for years. He finally escapes back to civilization.  The movie seems a little bit drawn out at times . But the end of the movie is the best part.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I tried this app but was looking for something that had more features.  It is OK for a basic alarm.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I started the game and already got scared. Ha. I love the graphics and I like how its black and white. I especially like how slenderman moves. Instead of the pc game. Definitely worth it!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone! (Just read the ones that come before it first) It made me laugh, it made me misty-eyed, and it made me fall in love with the characters even more!
B000AJIAOO|5.0|I gave this a great rating because I really enjoyed this band and it took me a while to find a store that has this CD. It was good to find it as a new product in great shape. I would recommend this CD to anyone.
0446691437|5.0|Good book. I listened to the audiobook first and wanted to get something tangible for my bookshelf. Pressfield does a good job at personifying &#34;Resistance&#34; and how to view it in a way that helps you overcome it and achieve your goals.
B00005K3NR|5.0|great horror movie. loved sisssy spacek and piper laurie as mother and daughter. steven king has done it again. recommend for all horor movie fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a lot like temple run but is still good well in my opinion even better than good great
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I picked this book for part of my home schooling class and i didn't expect it to be as good as it was i definitely suggest you read this
B005LAIIFS|5.0|Such a cute representation of all our favorites childhood beliefs. loved the bunny being afraid of kids and calling the little girl an ankle bitter.
0440245206|5.0|I bought this book for my sister.<br />She collects ALL of Danielle Steels books.<br />She don't collect the hard cover. Just the Mass Market Paperback.<br />She has every book and as a new one is made. I buy it for her for Christmas.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I watched on line and I ordered a copy for my uncle. I had difficulty hearing dialog online, but that may be my problem. I also had some kind of glitch where the video stopped. My uncle reported to me that his copy stopped at 108 minutes, but since he got it to continue, he did not wish to return it.  The atmosphere and the acting were excellent. The look at the workings of government and the passage of the 13th ammendment were fascinating. I will have to get better speakers or get a dvd myself to improve sound quality. I don't know if the pause was intentional or not on the disk and online. I liked seeing Lincoln's character being portrayed as a politician, storyteller, husband, and father in a more real and rounded way, not just as a revered and heroic figure.<br /><br />I will have to look at the movie again to see if it really holds up as a drama. I felt somewhat disappointed in the lack of emotional involvement that I felt at times.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Both my grandsons enjoy this game immensely.  I have yet to be able to try it.  But it has to be a good one when everyone of my little ones enjoy it.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It was an interesting movie but very strange. I'm glad we watched it but I certainly wouldn't watch it again.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I didn't pick this one, my grand kids did.  So I could only give a two star rating!  I don't know anything about this game.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Awesome movie.<br />Its interesting how the movie plays out from the 1st series ALL the way to the end.<br />Now if I only had the books to see if the ending is the same.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I was very surprised watching this movie. Usually i am not attracted to that kind but this one kept me interrested past the simplistic story. Good acting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|One of the most moving books I have ever read.  I have always known heaven existed, now a man of science has witnessed it.  Great reading.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, especially since it was quite long.  It was challenging enough to make it fun, but not too difficult that it became hard to play.  Highly recommended!
B007RTAR64|5.0|A piece of collection, great quality and very detailed. It was for a gift and my friend was charmed with it.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Awesome movie.<br />These movies are actuall better than Twilight.<br />I first watched these before Twilight was ever made.<br />Just plain awesome movie if you like Vampires.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|15 stars for the trilogy. All the books are great. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the first one where it all began with the history of the Games. I especially liked the portrayal of Katniss, as she's not the prefect little heroine. Instead, she's human with all the mixed emotions, anxieties and doubts expected of someone in her position. Bravo!<br /><br />Note: There were no formatting issues with fonts in the edition I read. Also the price has increased on the trilogy set since I purchased it, you would be better off to purchase the three books separately.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Finally, the classic James Bond is back!  This is Daniel Craig's best 007 movie.  I never liked Daniel Craig as James bond in the first two movies (Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale) because Daniel Craig is no classic James Bond with the charisma and charm to a woman's heart.  In the first two movies (Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale), Daniel Craig was just a ruthless violent character who beat up others.  In contrast, Skyfall showed that there was more heart to James Bond which made Daniel Craig more like the classic James Bond.  Also, the opening artistic intro in the movie and the soundtrack are awesome.  It was great that the movie didn't just plop in a pop song like other movies.  Original stunts and surprises in the movie...definitely a must see.  Highly recommended!  Other great movies: - daisy  (Korean movie) - the man from nowhere (Korean movie) - Ichi - Kiss of the Dragon - The Seven Samurai - Three Outlaw Samurai - The Raid: Redemption - When the Last Sword Is Drawn - The Righteous Thief
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|My favorite Jane Austen, easy to read, just right for a short wait in line or a plane ride.  The best
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my all time fave game and now I have it on the go. Can't get no better than that.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Another movie they should've made more to a series of.<br />They made 5 of the original and only 2 of the newer version.<br />What gives?<br />I guess the older movies are better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I became addicted to this show so much that I would  watch  it on my iphone,i pad to my tv.....any chance i got. Now that ive watched all three seasons im depressed its over. Best show ever!. As you watch the show your transported to a time and place that you really feel your living it with the charachters. The acting and writing is superb, the only thing I wish is I could sit  in Mrs. Padmores kitchen and taste all of her goodies. Cant wait for season 4, it cant come fast enough.<br />XO<br />Patti stanger
B0089Q1TPM|3.0|Just what the doctor ordered thanx again good great thanx.  Many more silly words just to finish review. how Dumb.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Duhigg has done the effort to make the process of developing new habits a worthwhile endeavor for all of us, regardless of where we might live or work. Has applications to personal & professional development, relationships, and organizational activities. Provides excellent illustrations with compelling story-telling that keeps the pages turning. You'll find yourself retelling the stories as you develop new habits that support your goals.
B004I744AS|4.0|English is very usefull and gives BE and AE pronunciations. Italian not really reliable. I have not tried other languages
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Another awesome movie,<br />They haven't showed when the next series will be made to this movie on commercials but yet another good movie to watch with the BEAUTIFUL actresses in it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This was a very good book. It is typical james Rollins. The story is very good and worth reading but it is not as good as Amazonia or ice hunt. Very much recommended.
B001BWYZWA|4.0|good, good, good. I lked it a ok ok hey. thanx a I a I a I a I by
B000209ZAE|2.0|First, the good: This drill stand is somewhat well thought out, and does precision drilling, which is my main concern. But, that's it for the \\"good\\"!<br />When I opened the first of these that I received, I noticed small parts scattered around the box, the internal cardboard pretty much destroyed, and part of the press had punched through the box. The screw for the \\"head\\" (holding the drill) was bent beyond use, and upon assembly, I found that the pull-down cam and roller, only allowed 1/3 of the designed travel.<br />I notified Amazon and they promptly replaced the item.<br />Upon opening the second box, I found the same small parts scattered around the box, but this time, everything was contained in the box, even though the box was internally \\"beat-up\\", and nothing was in it's original position. I assembled the stand and found that the slot in the \\"pull-down cam\\" was made incorrectly, binding the roller and limiting the travel of the head to not quite the total designed distance. Forcing the head to the bottom of its travel resulting in jamming, and the mechanism would not return to the normal position by itself. Removing the cam, and filing the slot remedied the problem, although there's still a scraping sound each time the lever is depressed.<br />Additional thoughts: the scale for the fence could be useful, but why isn't it printed with numbers? The fence may have an application, but there is nothing that aligns it perpendicular to the scale. The screw on the tool clamp is laughable! If the crossbar isn't horizontal, it hits the base and stops the downward travel of the tool! Absurd! I replaced it with a metric Allen head screw from the local hardware store.<br />In summation:<br />THE FACTORY PACKAGING IS COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR THIS DEVICE. This poor packaging is probably the reason for some of the other problems noted in this review. Proxxon should be ashamed to send out merchandise of this quality! Thus ends the myth of \\"German craftsmanship\\".
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy s*** does not even begin to cover it! It has been a very long time since I read a book this amazing. I loved the story, the character development... everything. It was completely amazing. Sky and Holder are wonderfully written into a believable couple that have rough patches but do not experience torturous knee jerk reactions. This book was definitely one I will be recommending to anyone that will listen!! Get ready Colleen, I will be a huge supporter of your work after this book!! I not only \\"lived\\" this book but I completely fell in love with it!! Again... amazing!
