B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie sucked. All that time waiting for the script and the rewrites for this piece of garbage.<br />Should have been called Raiders of the lost plot or Indiana Jones and the lazy director. George Lucas is by far the worst director in the world. What a waste of $7. Would have given it no stars if that was an option.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|David Gilmour (one-time Pink Floyd singer/guitarist) just released his new live package entitled Live in Gdansk (in many formats 2-CD, 2-CD/1-DVD, 2-CD/2-DVD, a 3-CD/2-DVD and 5-LP configurations) and is indeed a MUST for all David Gilmour and Pink Floyd fans. Sadly, this package is the swan song for Gilmour's Pink Floyd bandmate keyboard player Rick Wright who sadly passed away a week ago from cancer.<br />There are 22 songs on the 2 CDs of Live in Gdansk, which documents the last show Gilmour performed on his On an Island tour at the Gdansk Shipyards in Gdansk, Poland on August 26, 2006.<br />Gilmour was backed onstage by the late Rick Wright, PF 1987 alum which were keyboard player Jon Carin and bass player Guy Pratt, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, sax player Dick Parry and drummer Steve DiStanislao. Lastly on this album, he is joined by The Baltic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Zbigniew Preisner.<br />The first CD begins with three from Dark Side of the Moon which are \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Breathe (Reprise)\\" (all are excellent versions). Next is the On an Island portion (which is the first half of the first DVD in the set). \\"Castellorizon\\" is amazing live (especially with the orchestra) followed by a spirited \\"On An Island\\" which is superior to the studio version. \\"The Blue\\" is followed and betters the version on the Remember That Night DVD. Next is \\"Red Sky at Night\\" which is more haunting here with the orchestra and the addition of Carin's lap steel guitar to offset Gilmour's passionate sax playing. Next is a jazzy \\"This Heaven\\". We follow with \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" is an excellent version. \\"Smile\\" is a great version. \\"Take A Breath\\" is awesome here, especially with the orchestra. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" follows and is passionate. The excellent \\"Where We Start\\" finishes the first CD (and the first half of the first DVD).<br />The second disc starts with a haunting \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" (with a superb glass harmonica intro) then followed by spirited versions of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" (also on first DVD) and \\"Fat Old Sun\\". \\"High Hopes\\" is next and works great with orchestra (also on first DVD) then a spellbinding version of \\"Echoes\\" (also on first DVD). \\"Wish You Were Here\\" follows and is a great version. Next is the song \\"A Great Day for Freedom\\" (which is a superb version and is on the first DVD). CD 2 ends with a jawdropping version of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (which sadly has the last vocal performance of Rick Wright).<br />The third disc (the first of 2-DVDs) has the concert and a documentary plus access to songs ready for download (including \\"Wots...Uh the Deal\\" (left off the CDs for time constraints).<br />The second DVD features songs from the Mermaid Theater concert from March 7, 2006 (that were left off Remember That Night). Also, two tracks from the AOL Sessions in April, 2006 (which were only on the CD/DVD re-issue of Remember That Night). Plus you get three Barn Jams 2007 recorded at Gilmour's home in Sussex, England on the second DVD (which are now sadly the last pieces of music Gilmour made with Wright before Wright's passing last week). Also there are some Easter Eggs that I cannot give away and you will have to see to find out plus the On an Island album in 5.1 Surround Sound.<br />This album is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ollowed by spirited versions of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" (also on first DVD) and \\"Fat Old Sun\\". \\"High Hopes\\" is next and works great with orchestra (also on first DVD) then a spellbinding version of \\"Echoes\\" (also on first DVD). \\"Wish You Were Here\\" follows and is a great version.

B0009SS00A|5.0|I'll make this review short. I loved it. Couldn't put it down. Another excellent book by Dan Brown! I liked the fast action between chapters.
075640407X|5.0|DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOOL YOU!    Seriously, look at them, people who did not like this book consist of:    1. People with short attentions spans, who didn't even read the whole book in it's entirety. People are looking for the fantasy book equivalent of a B class action movie.  2. People who were intimidated by the main character, who probably work at McDonald's for a living, who have dull minds and dull futures.  3. People who think the main character isn't possible, again, people who are so mediocre they can't even fathom how somebody like Kvothe could exist.  4. People who think the story was missing something, should this story include everything about everything in the world it's set in? Of course not.  5. People who find the book too wordy, who think being less descriptive, less detailed, and less thoughtful is a good thing when writing epic fantasy novels.    AGAIN! DON'T LET THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOOL YOU!
B00006LJ72|5.0|Anyone who appreciated Enya's music would love to have this item.  It spans a majority of her career and includes some of her best work.  The included booklet contains great pictures and full lyrics (including some that have never before been in print) along with a brief statement regarding the inspiration for the song.<br />This collection is a limited release, beautifully packaged and well worth having.

B00005JM02|5.0|Sorry Nemo, but Toy Story is still my favorite, although this comes extremely close. This movie is great for all ages and a must have for families.
B000000OA6|5.0|I remember when this album was released, a friend of mine told me he saw a TV special about Queen. He said that Freddie, in particular, looked very unhealthy in the videos for \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives.\\" Well, I think we all know what happened to Freddie Mercury just months after this release. Although he was a fairly private person, the performance and the lyrics are Freddie's most personal. \\"Innuendo\\" features Steve Howe of Yes on the acoustic middle 8th. Freddie sings \\"Don't take offence at my innuendo (probably more in reference to his playful side than anything else). Some people have compared this to the middle 8th in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" is a more humourous song, with hilarious lines \\"I think I'm a banana tree\\" and \\"I'm riding only 3 wheels these days, my dear, how about you?\\" John Deacon closes with a fast bassline. \\"Headlong\\" is more like the oldschool Queen as is \\"I Can't Live without You,\\" both featuring some great guitar work from Brian May. \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is a more personal song, warning people to do their best but not kill themselves in the process. \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" is reminiscent of \\"Don't Lose Your Head,\\" with Roger Taylor's fast and furious drums and opening narration \\"Push the envelope, don't sit on the fence!\\" \\"All God's People\\" sounds a little like \\"Somebody to Love,\\" with its waltzy tempo and Gospel flavour. \\"Rule with your heart and lead with your conscience,\\" Freddie preaches in the song. This song also features the operatic harmonies that graced earlier albums like A Night at the Opera. \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" is a sensitive ballad about growing old with the one you love. \\"No use wondering what you did when you can sit back and enjoy it through your kids.\\" \\"Delilah\\" is a humourous song about Freddie's cat and Brian makes cat sounds with his Red Special guitar. \\"Hitman\\" is almost a heavy metal rewrite of \\"Another One Bites the Dust.\\" This song is probably meant to be tongue in cheek, as it seems uncharacteristic with the rest of the album. Brian plays a lovely romantic solo at the beginning of \\"Bjou\\" (which means \\"sacred jewel\\"). Finally, we come to the closing track, the ultimate farewell song \\"The Show Must Go On.\\" Freddie probably knew his days were numbered but stayed strong, as you can hear with lyrics \\"Empty places, what are we living for?... I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\\" On this no one can argue- Queen's legacy will go on.be tongue in cheek, as it seems uncharacteristic with the rest of the album.

B00009ZYC1|5.0|A spin on Disney princess tales. This movie is one of the best animated hits in history.
B000002UAC|4.0|This was the Beatles' 2nd album in the UK. Like the debut, Please Please Me, most of this album was recorded in one session. The cover was inspired by the works of Astrid Kirschnerr, whom the Beatles became friends with while in Hamburg. I heard a few takes of \\"Hold Me Tight\\" where Paul's voice cracks slightly on take 23, \\"Let me go on... ohbloodyhell!\\" (he was even the perfectionist back in 1963). Of course, the engineer (running out of patience) screams \\"24!\\" as the Beatles seem to get it right on the take used. On With the Beatles, the Beatles give a nod to Motown with their readings of \\"Please Mr. Postman,\\" \\"Devil in Her Heart\\" sung by George), \\"Money (That's What I Want\\" and \\"You Really Got a Hold on Me\\" (I recall the latter being on the Beatles' animated series, produced by Al Brodax, where a snake is tightly coiled around Ringo). The Motown influence would be realized on original songs like \\"Not a Second Time\\" (part of a trilogy of \\"no 2nd chance if you blow it the 1st time\\" songs, including \\"You Can't Do That\\" and \\"Run For Your Life\\" on later albums; John sang lead on each of the 3) and \\"All I've Got to Do\\" (with jazz progressions on the intro). This album also features George's writing debut \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" a slightly bitter lament over unrequited love, which if he didn't get back, he certainly wasn't going to give any other girl a piece of his affections. \\"Little Child\\" is a simple song which recalls the influence of skiffle (folk and blues) with a harmonica played by John. \\"All My Loving\\" became famous as the 1st song the Beatles sang on Ed Sullivan. Paul croons sweetly \\"Till There Was You\\" from the 1950's show The Music Man. Ringo sings \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" which, though written by John and Paul wrote this, was 1st recorded by the Rolling Stones as their 2nd single. George sings lead on Chuck Berry's \\"Roll Over Beethoven.\\" Finally, opening the album, John sings lead on the catchy and exquisite \\"It Won't Be Long\\" with an impressive closing chord progression. In the USA and Canada, most of these songs would make their way onto Meet the Beatles (which used the same cover photo) and others would find their way onto The Beatles' 2nd Album, both released the following year.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This was the most original Pixar film since Toy Story, in my opinion. Keep it up Pixar!
B000000OE7|4.0|Though this album may have tracks from different years and took 3 years after the Concert for Life in 1992, as a whole, it sounds more cohesive than Hot Space. With the exception of the 2 bonus tracks (particularly the never ending 20+ minute instrumental) and \\"You Don't Fool Me\\" which sounds like another \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" rewrite, most of the songs are top notch. Brian, Roger and John added their musical and production touches to make this album sound as relevant as anything which was big in 1995. \\"It's a Beautiful Day (both parts)\\" sound like Freddie is enjoying every minute, not worried when his time is coming (the 1st part sounds warm and placid, the 2nd part features snippets of \\"7 Seas of Rhye\\" and \\"Mustapha\\" thrown into the mix). \\"Mother Love\\" is one of the saddest songs Queen ever recorded, made even more depressing by the fact that this was the last song Freddie recorded (Brian sang the last verse as Freddie was too ill to finish). \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\" cheers things up a bit (originally the B-side to \\"Scandal.\\" \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" is from the Cross, a Roger Taylor project and \\"I Was Born to Love You\\" is originally from Freddie Mercury's Mr. Bad Guy album. Now for the best songs: \\"Made In Heaven\\" is a power ballad, with the typically atypical chord changes the classic Queen was known for. This version of \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" sounds even better than the one on Brian May's solo Back to the Light, with Freddie Mercury singing lead. \\"Let Me Live\\" features Freddie, Brian and Roger each on lead (apparently, the idea of all 3 of them singing was Freddie's idea back when he was still alive). It's almost reminiscent of the Beatles' mix on \\"Free as a Bird,\\" which came out the same year and Queen's own \\"Play the Game.\\" The introspective and poignant \\"A Winter's Tale\\" is featured near the close the album, as the last song Freddie wrote (it was also featured near the end of a documentary Champions of the World). Those of you who prefer the Queen of the 1970's may not like it as much as their older music but Made In Heaven remains an appropriate tribute to the late great Freddie Mercury.

031606792X|5.0|I am shocked to learn that so many people did not like the book Breaking Dawn.  I for one was completely captivated by it from start to finish.  I was thrilled with the way she ended a series that I have been utterly swept away in.  I feel that she tied up all the characters and their lives perfectly.  I loved every minute of it and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  I cannot believe anyone could feel any other way.    I am deeply saddened about the unfortunate events surrounding Midnight Sun.  I have read her draft on her web site and am crushed that she is not planning to finish it.  If there were some way for all of her loyal fans to convince her to move forward and publish it  I would gladly be there standing in line to encourage her brilliant writing, as well as buy a copy upon completion.

This is a great novel that I highly recommend for anyone who likes easy reading and romance. I don't like reading books with long chapters or with hard words I can't understand. I didn't like reading novels till I discovered this writer Emily Giffen. My friend let me borrow \\"Baby Proof\\" and I was hooked. Now, I want to read all her novels. Her novels are very easy to read which I love.

I really liked the movie and had few ways to think of how they could have made it better. This movie will definetly have you amazed and thinking...\\"damn, i wonder if they will ever have the ability to really do this??\\" A must have blu-ray to add to your collection!
B000ZELISO|5.0|Let's face it. The Order of the Phoenix movie left out a ton of good stuff. I just hope they do a lot better with this one. It is my favorite book of the series and would hate to see it messed up on the big screen, especially the ending. Judging from the teaser trailer and pictures that have been released, it looks like a great movie. I'll be counting down the days until July 17.

B000AYELVA|4.0|\\"X-Men\\" is based on the Marvel comic-book series and hit the big screen in 2000. Directed by Bryan Singer, the film stars - amongst others - Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn.    Mutants are seen as the next step in humankind's evolution and born with a slightly different genetic makeup - a variation that generally brings a superpower with it. You won't necessarily be able to tell just by looking at someone they're a mutant, however - in many cases, mutants look just like normal humans. In fact, only three of the characters in the film - Toad, Mystique and Sabretooth - look anyway different. In most cases, a mutant won't even know that they are a mutant until they reach puberty - which is generally when their powers 'switch on'. Throw in an unhealthy dose of widespread anti-mutant sentiment, and an over-complicated adolescence gets even worse.     Rogue is one such teenager. The poor girl enjoys her first kiss, and sees her young boyfriend collapse into a coma. Unfortunately for Rogue, her mutant superpower is destined to make her lonelier than most : skin-on-skin contact with another human will see her absorbing that person's life-force. (Although she doesn't know it at first, touching another mutant will also see her - briefly - gaining that mutant's superpower). In a blind panic, she flees - running more or less randomly to small-town Alaska. There, she finally has a bit of luck - when she runs into Wolverine, a cagefighter who's also a mutant. Originally known as Logan, Wolverine has an adamantium skeleton, a very sensitive nose, and a hyperactive healing factor. (You can injure him - he just won't stay injured for very long). However, he doesn't have much of a past - Wolverine's life is a mystery even to him. Unfortunately, the pair have barely made their introductions before they're dragged into a war...    On their way out of town, Rogue and Wolverine are attacked by Sabretooth - a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, led my Magneto. Luckily, two X-Men called Storm and Cyclops arrive to help, and take the pair back to their base in New York State. The initial assumption is that Magneto wanted Wolverine for some reason. The X-Men's leader - Professor Charles Xavier, the world's most powerful telepath and a one-time friend of Magneto's - wants to find out why. He asks Wolverine agrees to stay a little while and, in return, the Prof will try to help Logan remember his past. Rogue, meanwhile, is enrolled at the  Professor's School for Gifted Youngsters. The school could be viewed as a cover of sorts : the Professor's abilities are not public knowledge, though the 'gifted youngsters' are actually mutants. The purpose of the school is to train young mutants how to properly - and responsibly - control and use their powers. The Professor also believes humans and mutants can live peacefully, side-by-side - Magneto, on the other hand, disagrees.     Magneto is not alone in his belief : Senator Kelly - a 'standard', though influential, human - sees mutants as something to be feared and, therefore, requiring control. The Senator very strongly advocates the Mutant Registration Act, though he wants even more than that. \\"If it were up to me\\", he says \\"I'd lock them all away\\". If it weren't for people like Kelly raising the stakes and talking of imprisoning people without trial, this war may never have needed fought...    A cracking superhero movie overall. There's a bit more of Wolverine than any of the other heroes, though there is a heavy side-order of Rogue - who I liked a lot more onscreen, than did in print. (I was very impressed with Paquin's performance as Rogue, and also Romijn as Mystique. A member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Mystique is a shapeshifter. However, while she doesn't look human in her natural form, she does look very cool). The sparring between Cyclops and Wolverine also worked very well, and provided a few comic moments. I wasn't too impressed with Storm, though - her contribution to the movie was pretty much non-existent. That may well have been down to the writing, but I'm not sure Halle Berry was all that bothered about making the most of her screen-time. Still, other than that, a very enjoyable show.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I love the original trilogy of Star Wars. It is far better than episodes 1, 2, and 3. And far more memorable. These will be around forever.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Good fun.  There's action amd tension and lightness to make gripping and entertaining a storyline that might otherwise be somewhat predictable.  Ben Browder in particular manages to inject pathos and humour as well as being delightful eye candy.    Highly recommended.
B000W746GK|4.0|The trio is growing up. And so are their acting skills. I loved the ending with the... wait no spoilers! Great movie!
0375826726|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Brisingr,\\" even though the great parting toward the end was incredibly sad. I kind of wish it had been split into 2, though, because it's so heavy, both in weight and content. I appreciate that they included synopses of \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" because I found that a fair amount of information had slipped my mind since I wasn't able to read them all head-to-tail. I admit to some disappointment that this isn't the end simply because I now have to WAIT for the ending!!!
B000W91RUG|4.0|The Big bang Theory is an excellent show - witty and warm with  well drawn characters and well thought through story lines. There was a bit of a dip in quality during the middle of the series but by the end it was back on top form - and the Time Machine Episode had one of the great set piece comic moments.Sheldon is an excellent comic creation and kaley Cuoco does really well with establishing Penny as a well rounded and tolerant person.

0375826726|3.0|This is a long book full of story building material, but it never comes together into an actual story.  The whole book is about how to kill the king and get a sword but it dosen't seem to have an ending.  I am sure that there will be more books but I don't think I will spend the money.  This isn't in the same caliber as Eragon.
0375826726|4.0|It was a good read, a bit wordy and sometimes some things just seemed added just for fun and really didn't add to the plot movement at all, but over all it was a good tale. And it has to be remembered that the book was cut in half so feeling slightly miffed on the plot is understandable we don't have the final half of it so what seems trivial now and dragging may have more significance later. And it is for that reason I give it four stars instead of five. Either way I doubt fans of the series are going to be disappointed, many questions are answered new ones have arisen and when you get to the end you find yourself saying \\"yeah it was a bit tedious but now with all the wheels set in place and no minute matters that the characters must attend too it will be interesting to see how the story ends.\\"
6305428042|5.0|Along with \\"Clue,\\" this is what I consider one of the greatest Halloween movies ever made. It starts with the death of 3 witches (Winifred, Sarah, and Mary). Also, Zachary gets turned into a black cat by them after he unsuccessfully tries to save his sister Emily. We then move to a present day classroom in Salem where a class has heard about what happened. Did what we see really happen, or was it just an acted out story the teacher was telling? GREAT AMBIGUITY! Max doesn't believe the story, which makes him somewhat of an outcast. He seems interested in Allison; she is not exactly rude to him, but she doesn't seem overly interested in forming a relationship with him either. We also see that Max has some problems with his younger sister Danielle. (He doesn't want to take her trick or treating.) But they patch things up, and they run into Allison. They decide to visit where the 3 witches they learned about in class died. In a dramatic, but also hilarious fashion, the 3 witches are resurrected, and they plan their revenge on Salem. This movie is great that while the 3 witches are unquestionably evil, they carry a charm that makes them hilarious and lovable despite. Basically, they want to kill enough people so that they can make a potion that will enable them to live forever. (Another thing that is so funny is that they are trying to take over a world they don't know. They don't know what a bus is; they think fire men are witch hunters; they think the trick or treaters are real monsters, etc.) In an especially hilarious moment, Winifred walks into a kitchen and says: \\"Behold! A torture chamber!\\" Allison, Max, and Danielle, along with the black cat Zachary are sometimes uneasy allies, but they are determined to stop the witches from taking over Salem. Overall, there is a phenomenal combination of horror, suspense, and comedy. Even characters with small parts like Danielle's parents make the most of their roles. (Danielle's mother is humiliated when she tries to explain an R rated costume she wore to an adult party. Of course, she didn't expect Danielle to find her there!) There is also a great climax with a touch of tragedy.  Probably one of the best things about this movie is that often we are not sure as to whether we are watching a horror movie or a comedy. But it's all Halloween! And of course with Bette Midler as the head witch, there is a great song in the middle (which in this case turns out to be a spell). If you love Halloween, this movie is a MUST!an R rated costume she wore to an adult party. Of course, she didn't expect Danielle to find her there!)

0375826726|5.0|I enjoyed the previous two Inheritance Series books and found that Brisingr met all my expectations. I found the dialogue to be more polished than in previous books and I enjoyed \\"hearing\\" Saphira's thoughts.  The fact that the final book was split does not bother me because I don't feel that the pace of Brisingr is slow at all.  The author just has a bit more story to tell than originally planned.
0316067601|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The sheer bravery of these elite warriors who fight for our country leaves me in aww. What they go through and en dour to be a Navy SEAL is beyond my ability and comprehension. It also shows there is good in this world when you least expect it. I was absolutely stunned by the help Marcus received, it made me close my eyes and think no matter how different we all are in this world, we are all linked by goodness and kindness of the heart if we choose it.     From a book standpoint I thought the story was incredible. I thought it was well written and I really enjoyed reading it from Marcus's first hand perspective. His slight humor at times hit home to me and his descriptions of certain things hit home as well and brought the story to your hands.     I am forever honored by the commitment of Marcus and his fallen brothers. I'll never forget this story, and when times are tough I find myself thinking of him and his brothers in arms. God Bless them all and God Bless the U.S.A.

This was the first \\"serious\\" book that I have read in years (since college) and I must say it was great. I endured a few late nights as I didn't want to put the book down. I just finished the book and I am sad that I don't have the next one to start reading right away.

0684865130|5.0|Catch-22 is a jarring, thrilling, hysterical exposition of the oppression and dominance which pervades lives and lifestyles in the modern era.  Full of classic dialogue, superb characters, wonderfully narrated, Catch-22 may be the best book ever written.  A heartbreaking achievement of staggering genius!
159562015X|2.0|I was hoping that Strengths Finder 2.0 would help me discover talents that are a little more specific - like a talent for numbers or a talent for paperwork. In fact, the book even starts out talking about talents like that, with examples of sports stars. But, what it ends up giving you is more a description of your preferred work style which, IMO, aren't really strengths or talents. Such as if you like a competitive environment or a cooperative one. If you like to think or to do. If you like variety or routine.    All this may be useful, but it wasn't quite what I had in mind. It isn't going to be something I can walk into an interview with and sell as a competitive advantage.
015626224X|5.0|This novel is filled with fantastic stories and insightful and refreshing social commentary.  Important and entertaining.
031606792X|4.0|For the past 2-3 weeks, the \\"Twilight\\" saga has been a little like an addiction for me and \\"little\\" may be a bit of an understatement - I can understand why there has been so much excitement around these books.  They are not the best books ever written (perhaps not literature with a capital \\"L\\"), but they are creative and captivating.  Despite some conservative Christian themes and some blatant references to Shakespearean works, these books are riveting in a way that is truly special.  Young adults everywhere are so fortunate that YA literature has been taken to such new, exciting heights in the past decade.<br /><br />However, against all expectations I have to give this novel four stars entirely because of Bella, who was written as though she is much older than the tender age of 18.  Her thought process, reactions, and range of emotion are just not that of a teenager.  Had Meyer allowed more time to pass between her first and fourth books, allowed Bella to at least break into her twenties, I probably would have given \\"Breaking Dawn\\" five stars.  This one, seemingly tiny, fact distracted me throughout the entire course of the book and makes me worry about the messages being sent to young female readers still trying to grasp at what normalcy really means and how to manage expectations of themselves as they grow up (this is me trying desperately not to give away the entire plot).<br /><br />Still, I love this series and recommend it very highly.  If you are in need of a distraction from what is going on in your life - or dare I say, a safe addiction - these may be the books for you.
B001GLUQIS|5.0|I am pleased to state that Fringe is now one of my new favorite shows. The acting is good, smart concept, solid show for your viewing pleasure. Better than Lost, Better than 24!
B001BKG9SK|3.0|oh boy, I will be in trouble for daring to suggest this is only worth 3.5 stars....<br />CD wise this is a blend of classic Floyd stuff (with a slightly mellow undertone) and a live version of On An Island. Your enjoyment may be based on how much you like Island, I found the original a bit bland and found the live version the same, interesting but not up to the Floyd standards. The more mellow approach to the Floyd stuff is interesting and gives a different slant to the variations we all already have and already I am re-playing the Floyd aspects of this concert and skipping over the Island stuff (sorry Dave).<br />The DVD stuff is of obvious interest but could have been so much better with better sound and editing, but is still worthwhile and is what raises this to a 3.5 rating from a 3.<br />And in the background we hear the late, and great, Rick Wright in his last performance, worth buying for this alone.
0143038419|3.0|I loved the concept of the book. Her adventures were memorable, her quest was admirable and it was all written with a witty tone that made it easy to devour this book. The only downfall to me is that I found the narrator/author to be quite annoying and overly self-absorbed. Unfortunately, this greatly detracted from the overall majesty of the book.
B00007LTIB|4.0|Yes' 1974 album \\"Relayer\\" features Jon Anderson on vocals, Steve Howe on guitar, Chris Squire on bass, Alan White on drums and Patrick Moraz (formerly of the band Refugee) on keyboards (electric pianos and synthesizers mostly). Patrick would only be a member of Yes for this album, and the lineup has a unique harder and jazzier sound than the Yes albums before it. \\"Gates of Delirium\\" and \\"Sound Chaser\\" are intense tracks! It's interesting how one member can change the dynamic of a group. Still, \\"Relayer\\" continues in the spirit of \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", with the lengthier songs and more progressive exploration. It does gets a tad over-the top in places for me, like Steve Howe's guitar solo in the middle of \\"Sound Chaser\\", there are moments like that which just feel a bit out of place. Ah well...     Mind you, it's not all intense, there are some quite gentle and tender moments on the tracks \\"Soon\\" and the finale \\"To Be Over\\", some of the more gentle they've ever been.     This re-issue, like the re-issues of \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\", comes in a beautifully designed digipak, with the booklet tucked away in between the fold-out cover. The booklet contains an essay about the tracks, and about how the album was made, including comments from various band members. Bonus tracks include the single edits of \\"Soon\\" (which is nice to have for the ol' MP3 player if you only feel like that part of \\"Gates of Delirium\\") and \\"Sound Chaser\\" (which is reduced to an instrumental, unfortunately). There's also the run through of \\"Gates of Delirium\\", which has a rawer, more live-sound, much more emphasis on the guitar and the drums. Some of the lyrics are different too, and there's even a few bursts of white noise towards \\"Soon\\".    It's one of the essential Yes albums, I think, and if you're feeling particularly adventurous it could even be your first! All depends on what you're after.
0743289684|5.0|Reading this book was like embarking on a quest that transcends time, traditions, cultures, freedoms, & beliefs, while following the growth of a truly amazing woman. The writing is incredible, I could not put the book down from the first line to the last. The stories are unimaginable to someone who has grown up in the West, being nurtured by family & society to work to one's full potential, stressing openness, freedom, & communication. This book clears up a lot of questions that have been brooding in my mind about Islamic societies, and how they can possibly function, when ½ of the population is oppressed in every way. It was fascinating to understand just how deeply embedded religion is in everyday life and the \\"submission\\" aspect of one's relationship with Allah, which I was not aware of before.    Ayaan, you are one brave woman and a warrior, I thank you for the contributions you have made to societies across the world by exposing the abuse of women in Islam. You have made this planet a better place for many women, even if they do not understand this fact. Hopefully, their daughters will. I know that they will. I'm sorry that this has come at great personal sacrifice to you, but know that your compromised freedom has given the possibility of freedom to millions around the globe.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud, wincing, smiling, feeling cold fingers of fear on my heart, and hoping wildly.<br /><br />Visually stunning and poetic, a feast of colors and shapes, The Fall is absolutely entrancing.  It's a lyrical tribute to the human spirit, risk-taking, imagination, suffering and loss, survival and triumph.  Singh also shows the power of the medium itself. If you want your movies to imitate life, make perfect linear sense at all times and tie everything up neatly, it's not for you.<br /><br />The Wizard of Oz, with its dual fantasy/reality cast, came to mind; Untaru gives us another strong and vulnerable little girl heroine who takes hold of both real life and her dreams with both hands -- indeed, she doesn't make much difference between the two, which is one of the essential characteristics of a blessed childhood (and to some extend, adulthood as well).<br /><br />It made me want to run away and see the world.
0439813786|5.0|My daugher and son rarely love the same book - but this one they did.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|First off, I really understand the people that say that the Kings are just trying to not repeat themselves. I understand the reviewer that says that our beloved Kings are trying to broaden their audience.   I admire their musicianship, I really do, but I think this album was rushed, and the \\"rock\\" factor that made them great is long gone. No \\"Molly's Chambers\\" no \\"King of the Rodeo\\", no more \\"My Party\\" or \\"Ragoo.\\"     They could've reached out to a larger fan base without turning into a sappy band.     I would save about 4 songs. All the rest are disposable in my opinion.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|Its not good. I think the only decent song is Crawl, and that just because of the kickass bass guitar sound. They sold out to the MTV fanbase and alienated all of their true fans. It's just too bad. Hopefully they can get back to their rockin' ways with their next album!!
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I heard this CD on a story on NPR.    I loved the clips that I heard so I bought the CD.  It's one of the best that I've heard this year, and that includes Fleet Fox, Bon Iver, and Conner Oberst.    The lyrics are great, and the music is very catchy.  Why is this group not more popular?    And if you like this CD their first CD, Sink or Swim, is as good or better than this one.
0307269752|5.0|I began to lose hope.  The books I've picked up lately have been ho-hummers.  But `The Girl with the dragon Tattoo' knocked me out of the doldrums .<br /><br />This is a complex story--- mystery,  `romance' of sorts, suspense, and detective novel all rolled into one.  Many interesting story threads finally merge into one for a very satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />The translation is excellent.  This Swedish novel reads like an American novel.  Only rarely do translation defects appear.<br /><br />It's a shame Larsson died shortly after writing this superlative book.  The story would translate into the film medium to make one heckuva movie.  I can't wait for that.
B000006YGY|5.0|I am at the car wash bending down while cleaning my car. I have Atlantis' Agony blaring loudly from the Bose car stereo.     Suddenly, a guy is yelling at me:     \\"Wow men, wow, wow, wow wow!!! I love this music, I am over there just listening, but now I can't control myself anymore. Who is the artist, oh my God, this music is great!!! I am 50 years and I never heard anything like this!!!\\".    And so began a lengthy conversation about space rock music embodied by the likes of Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, etc, etc.     Instantly, I made a new friend who loves me like a brother.
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book, Infidel, explores enduring tension between reason and religion, between submission and freedom, between expression of the individual and clan loyalty.  It opens the closed doors of Islam and gives the reader permission to enter a world far removed from most Westerners' experience of reality.   Hirsi Ali allows the reader, not  a voyeuristic glimpse, but a thorough introduction to and illuminating journey through the world of Islam, as well as a fascinating account of her own self-liberation and integration into the West.
0307455874|4.0|Senator Obama has written an excellent book, interesting, honest and readable. In it, he outlines, inter alia, some of his views on US politics, race and foreign policy.    Personally, I was quite disappointed to learn of the superficiality of Barack Obama's Christianity. His is a Christianity that is anchored on the 'strong and steady rock' of public opinion.     For example he writes on page 223 in his chapter on Faith about an encounter he had with a Lesbian in which he apologizes to her for \\"my position on the issue\\" and says that by opposing homosexual marriage he was somehow \\"suggesting that she and others like her, were somehow bad people\\". His change of heart was precipitated, not by reflection on God's will on the matter, but by the realization that \\"in years hence I may be seen as someone who was on the wrong side of history\\".     To add to my disappointment, the senator from Illinois confirms the claims that he   has contempt for those with a belief in God, he says rather condescendingly that they \\"need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them.\\"     Unfortunately Mr. Obama does not consider the possibility that anyone could come to a realization of faith through the faculty of reason, everyone that has faith is to him obviously a poor deluded soul. It may say something about the Democratic party that the first African American with a real possibility of becoming the President of America had to be a man with no moral backbone, a proponent of deviant/homosexual rights and abortion/murder.    For readability, 4 stars, for Obama a thumbs down from me.
B001226QR6|5.0|It was good to hear these two together,both admirable in their own styles.<br />Particulary fond of BB's penny arcade,its so relatable.Sounds like they had a good time recording it.
0385340990|5.0|This is one of those historical fiction books that brings past events to life in such a striking way it creates an intimate connection. The author uses a series of letters to get you into the minds of the characters. More than a 3rd person monologue or narration, the letters give voyeuristic insights into their lives which seem truer and more effective. This is a book that will echo in my thoughts of World War II for years.<br /><br />I knew the fact that the Germans held the channel islands.  It pops up from time to time, a sentence here or a footnote there.  But for the islanders, this was their lives, their suffering, their history.  To read how England handled the islands, like restricting Red Cross aid packages never makes it into the footnote.  The islander's isolation comes alive in the letters and the reality of war and the relationships seems real, showing that in war, there is rarely a black and white divisions.  It shows that in war dark choices are made.<br /><br />I think too many Americans have a sanitized idea of the war.  This book brings the personal hardships to life. It also shows that this hardship did not stop on May 8th 1945 and memories of starvation do no die quickly. Lives and homes took time to recreate. These are the stories that don't make the history books, and this book fills in what a paragraph cannot tell.<br /><br />My wife and I are passing this book around to everyone we know and recommend everyone to read it.  It's a great read which my wife, a history teacher, claims is one of the 5 best historical fictions she has read (and that means a lot.) A wonderful book.<br /><br />If you have read [[ASIN:B000IX5ZTU Land Girls - A Spirited Novel Of Love And Friendship]] and loved it, you will love this one too.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I don't want to hype this movie too much but rather try to put everything in perspective that people are complaining (or not) about.  First the movie: Collateral is a great film with plenty of action & suspense. What makes this movie is the fact that it takes place completely at night - not that this is so unusual but it's in an urban environment (LA) and Michael Mann (Director) managed to film this in a way that has not been done before. The way LA looks at night - there's just something about it and it's right here. Some reviews complain about things like \\"the cab drives around with a heavily dented roof and never gets caught\\" - but honestly, how many people would notice that on a cab at night? The viewer gets wrapped up in the story easily, and both Cruise & Foxx deliver great performances (and I'm not a fan of either one of them).  Bonus disc has some very nice features also.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Refreshing, emotional, mature, perfection, these are some of many characteristics I could provide to this album. In Rainbows represents the other side of Radiohead. If Ok Computer was intense, dramatic, and explosive, In Rainbows is exquisit, relaxing and encouraging. After more experimental works like Kid A, Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief, Radiohead return to show us that they have no limits. Another masterpiece from them, maybe the best one.
0756404746|5.0|I may commit sacrilege amongst the fantasy and science fiction fans of the world when I say that I think Patrick Rothfus is better than the high priest of fantasy writing, JRR Tolkien. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was recommended to me by my boyfriend and after several months of ho-humming about it, I decided to give it a go. Imagine my giddy surprise when I found it to be just as good as I was told and even better. A marvelous story begins with a humble inn located in a backwater town where the local drunks tell tales into the wee hours of the morning, while the innkeeper, Kote, a mysterious red-haired stranger, quietly runs his inn and seeks a life of quiet. When a group of bizarre creatures attack travelers and a man appears at the inn, Kote finds his true identity revealed as Kvothe (\\"Quoth\\"), a legendary character called \\"Kingkiller\\". The Chronicler, the man who stumbles into his inn, asks that Kvothe reveal his story and so begins \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles, Day One\\". Over the course of three days, Kvothe tells his visitor, he shall reveal his story.    This book ranks as my favorite book, having pushed \\"American Gods\\" to the background with its rich characters, backgrounds, creatures and the marvelous tale pulsing beneath the surface. I am convinced of Mr Rothfuss' brilliance as a writer and his skills are outstanding. Kvothe is a marvelously drawn character, telling his tale in his own voice, with a sense of humor, a tragic past, and a passion for learning and knowledge that makes Harry Potter seem like a wimp. I was rooting for Kvothe nonstop, craving to learn more and more of his exploits. This being the first of a trilogy, I was treated to just the first day, but I do hope I won't have to wait long for more of this brilliant story.
0375826726|5.0|So I got this book on Wed (9/24) and finished it on (9/25). I could not put it down. The beginning was a little rough, but beginning in the middle and all they way until the end you will not want to stop reading, if you thought Eldest had a \\"i can't wait for the next book\\" ending then you haven't seen a thing yet. If you have read the previous books and was wondering about the third, look no further, get it, you would be at a sore loss if you didn't get it. I am going to re-read the book again its that good, things are underway and very seriously at that. I cannot wait for the fourth book...it should be out now but alas it needs to be finished. So in the long run, get this book if you have read the inheritance cycle.
0380715430|5.0|An absolutely delightful introduction to a history of the English language. Like the author's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", it approaches a huge subject with great enthusiasm -giving me a general understanding of a topic I previously knew very little about. A joy to read.     I've taken a few moments to write this very brief endorsement because I saw that one person was dissuaded from purchasing the book because of a one-star review. What a shame.
B0010X8NF0|2.0|Two and a half stars.  Half a star for cinematography and location...so watch if you like travelogue films.  Other than that, don't bother.  The makers of this film could have made a '60's style spiritual/social commentary, but opted to drop the ball, so to speak, and smugly leave us hanging without explanation.  It IS self explanatory, but the film makers leave too much to our imagination to do.  In this film, three self centered weenies go in search of--at first, or so the oldest brother of the three tells them--a spiritual quest.  Secretly, he's got them together to search for their mother who's \\"dropped out\\" (or IN, from her persective).  I sat for 50 minutes enduring their sad seeker baloney--and they're obviously vapid, rich jerks, plonked down in one of the poorer countries of the world (India)--traveling along aboard the train called the Darjeeling Limited.  Adrien Brody does have a moment to shine, and it's when the TRUE spiritual moment of the film happens (SPOILER ALERT) as he and his brothers save two of three boys who've fallen off their raft into a rapid river.  Now, a point can be made here, IF you believe in this sort of thing; they were in the right place at the right time--and THAT is what they should have acknowledged.  Yet, they go back to being vapid, spoiled drifters.  Still, even since the film makers didn't acknowledge that, other than visually, it still SAYS SOMETHING.  BUT, I think they were too involved in making something on the order of \\"Easy Rider\\" (with doofuses) and shot the message in the foot by wasting our time with the rest of it.  Their \\"apology\\" (IMHO) was in a scene near the end--a fellini moment--where the camera pans through each compartment of the train, including Bill Murray and the Tiger, as if to say;  \\"we're all on a journey through life, it may seem futile, but we're ALL together while doing it\\".  In making this 1960's style statement, I might admire, if it weren't for the fact that the 1960's were NO FUN.  Assasinations, war, & civil unrest made it all a turnmoil.  A few good movies commented on this.  This movie fails to hit the bulls eye in trying to achieve that, as it leaves the majority of the mass audience out of a punch line to the joke; despite our best efforts, we only succeed while we're busy making other plans, and maybe don't even notice we have succeeded.  these film makers haven't.
1596434252|5.0|The cover of this book is holographic, and shifting the angle you view it makes it change from A to B to C to D. Yes, it's ABCD and 3D!    It's also 3D inside, as you turn from page to page and letters arise from flat, shift from one letter to another in multiple ways, and otherwise delight your eyes.     The book is a bit delicate, so you'd want to assist a young child in handling it. My copy came with slips of paper in places to keep it from sticking. That worked well. When I had a little sticking later on the E letter changing to the F, I massaged the strip of paper that enables this change with wax paper. Voila, it then slid just fine.     ABC3D is a delightful work of art that will please both children and adults. I don't think you will be able to resist smiling!
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr  is indeed a worthy successor to the Eldest. The plot was very well created and the language is at its best. It is amazing how a 19 year old can write a trilogy like this. It was impossible for me to keep down the book and do minor things like eating and sleeping. All in all an extremely captivating tale and worth every penny. Its a must read.
1580088694|5.0|An through and interesting way to present the food of different cultures. The book not only shows a picture of what a week's worth of food looks like across the globe, but puts how much it costs and in USD. The book also elaborates on the eating habits, culture, and daily life of the people. There are also recipes! A great book with an eye opening perspective of people all over the world.
1563894696|4.0|The highlight of this Batman offering is above all, the artwork of Tim Sale.  His vibrant, unique compositions give the book's plotlines an edgy, kinetic energy which keeps the story moving along in the reader's mind even when Loeb's complex storyline sometimes fails to carry its weight.  The story is on balance very engrossing and ultimately very entertaining, even if it loses steam or strains for gravitas here and there.  It's an admirable attempt to cover all the ground of the Batman mythos- the fun superficialities of cape, cowl and gizmo, the pop philosophical musings on perceptions of justice and the large catalogue of villainous foes the Dark Knight meets along his crusade.  Indeed this book shows that Batman's fight for justice is a crusade of sorts in the classical sense of the term- a fight that is becoming more taxing and lengthy than he anticipated, and one perhaps undertaken with misguided intentions and resulting in unexpected consequences.  The greatest accomplishment of the writing is the Two Face story arc.  It covers the tragic story of Harvey Dent maybe even more ably than the recent film, though the characterization of the Joker in this instance is all style and little substance, pale (no pun intended) in comparison to the recent Ledger incarnation and light years behind the monstrous jester and seminal portrayal found in Alan Moore's 'Killing Joke'.  On par with the excellent Dent/ Two Face characterization here, is the intriguing and mysterious handling of Catwoman.  In this book and his other works like 'Dark Victory' and the 'Hush' volumes, Loeb has treated the Catwoman character with more respect and realism than most writers and rescued her from the campiness usually associated with her, and in so doing, given Batman an interesting and believable romantic interest and the Batman universe a much needed feminine foil and counterweight to all the testosterone fueled escapades.  All said, this comic may not crack the top five of the all time best Batman stories alongside, 'The Killing Joke', 'The Dark Knight Returns', 'Year One', 'Arkham Asylum' and the underrated 'Batman Year 100', but it is definitely a solid number 6 or 7, paired with 'Dark Victory', in the all time top ten.  Good read, escpecially for die hards.
0790729652|5.0|Works good..I love this film always have. Trying to get most if not all of them.
0800141806|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best movies. The story is moving, and will have you in tears multiple times. Tom truelly shines, and is one of the few actors that you no longer see as a person, but as their character. Very emersed. This will also question your thoughts and beliefs, and possibly make you reconsider the next time youre about to make a snap judgement.
0307269752|1.0|The reviews of this book led me to believe I had come across another addicting import, the last being Child 44. But unfortunately Stieg Larsson obsesses over back story and handles exposition like he has lobster mitts on. He wastes no chances to add useless material. And worse, he's infatuated with historical narrative rather than creating a dramatic scene. The paragraphs about the past are a bog from which it is difficult to emerge. It needs an editor. The book could have been 200 pages shorter and it would have been more interesting.<br /><br />I cannot recommend. Be forewarned.
B000000H5K|5.0|I popped this in after having spent almost 10 years away from it... and I have to say that this album inspires.<br /><br />It is not as technical as any of their previous works, but does leap off where Chaos AD left off.<br /><br />The goal here... was a return to simplicity.  We all know they can write technically inspired and classical riffs... they knew that too.  The goal is no more apparent than when you look at the cover and title of the album.  The fact remains that an album of this type has not been repeated by any other band since.<br /><br />The riffing is very simplistic at times, but to beat the dead horse:  that was the point.  I challenge metal listeners to find another song that sounds like Itsari... the native singing and dancing combined with some well-crafted Spanish acoustic.  Only the Swedish metal bands were doing anything remotely similar, specifically Dark Tranquillity and In Flames.<br /><br />Another reviewer commented that the historical relevance of the album is what contributes to its greatness;  I agree, but take the other view.<br /><br />In 1996 we also had Tool's \\"Aenima\\" and Manson's \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\"  This is the only other album that year that stands in line as a memorable performance with those three, and to contrast the Scandinavian release that year was In Flame's \\"The Jester Race,\\" and all four are albums I can come back to 12 years later and say, \\"that was f#$%^ good.\\"
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|Coldplays 'Viva La Vida' is an interesting piece of conceptual rock that when it connects with the listener it really connects, but when it misses, it REALLY misses. The coldplay of old is here, alas a little hard to find behind the flood of concepts and ideas sprinkled about.<br /><br />The three standout tracks in my humble opinion are 'Yes', 'Viva La Vida' and 'Violet Hill'. If the band could have captured those songs ideas along the length of the album I may have mustered it a 4 star album. Everything else here is a little to experimental for its own good.
0307346617|5.0|I knew nothing about this book, but I bought it just for kicks. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was like reading hundreds of different zombie movies in a row, but from the unique views of people all around the world. Max Brooks creates a very shocking and sometimes scary view of what the world would be like if a massive zombie outbreak should occur. Amazing detail of every account makes this book a must read for any zombie enthusiast or horror lover. A+ reading all the way.
B000V3OKW0|5.0|If you listen to Bach, love Cello as a musical instrument, enjoy intellectual, substantial, structured Baroque music and have not heard Fournier's recordings of these Cello Suites DO NOT WASTE ANOTHER MOMENT! Oftentimes words are inadequate to describe a musical composition or a performance; This is one of those occasions.<br /><br />I do not believe a mortal man can write this music, neither do I belive it's possible perform it, as it's on this set. It never gets old!
B0017ANAZY|1.0|The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand \\"Sex and the City\\" which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? The movies like \\"The Women\\" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clich&eacute;d, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?<br /><br />After I saw the new movie, I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it.

B0002BO0AS|5.0|What Seattle was to grunge and alternative rock in the Nineties, the state of Massachusetts has become to metal and hardcore in this decade. Boston-based Unearth is yet another band to spring from this fertile musical soil. What distinguishes them from their peers is a sound that veers more to the \\"hardcore\\" side of metalcore and their reputation for incendiary, leave-it-all-on-stage live performances. Unearth's songs are thick with mosh-inducing breakdowns and while melody runs through many of the riffs, you'll find very little in the way of melodic clean singing  here. What little there is gets handled by guitarist Ken Susi; lead vocalist Trevor Phipps is strictly a screamer. Apparently Phipps was also a big Rage Against The Machine fan growing up, because his vocal style and politically left-of-center lyrics resemble Zack de la Rocha in his more metal moments, especially on tracks like \\"The Great Dividers,\\" \\"Lie To Purify,\\" \\"Black Hearts Now Reign,\\" and \\"Zombie Autopilot\\"  (which also sounds a bit like Rise Against gone metal.) His voice is the perfect compliment to the heavy slabs of blistering, 7-string riffs laid down by the tag-team guitar attack of Ken Susi and Buzz McGrath, with the rhythm section of drummer Mike Justian and bass player John \\"Slo\\" Maggard providing a more-than-solid foundation for their bandmates to thrash on.  (Maggard also shows some skill at the piano on the haunting and atmospheric \\"Aries,\\" the only time the band takes a breather on a CD of boot-to-the-throat intensity.)  Tie it all together with the pristine production and engineering of Adam Dutkiewicz, and you have a metal album brutal and abrasive enough to piss off the neighbors, but musically and lyrically intelligent enough to grab and hold your attention. On both stage and CD, Unearth brings the ruckus and represents the hardest edge of the Mass Metal scene in style.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr is definitely the best of the series so far, Paolini's writing skills have improved leaps and bounds from Eragon and he has created a rich, involving and highly detailed world, obviously well thought out and painstakingly wrought. I have loved to watch Eragon grow and mature as he takes up his responsibilities, and while he still obviously cares for Arya, I'm glad he doesn't spend half the book drooling over her like a moonstruck calf. I almost wish he wasn't quite so impervious to harm, it's hard to be too excited about an upcoming battle or concerned about the hero's fate when he can heal himself out of hand, no matter how dire his wounds. Yes, it's wordy, but it is a book, not a text message, a book dealing with an epic war spanning an empire, several different cultures and peoples and dozens of characters with multiple storylines. What did you expect? I think that everyone is just too used to watching TV or playing video games and wants instant gratification. All in all, I'd say this is the best of the series so far and a wonderful, rich, thrilling adventure in its own right. The only thing I was disappointed in was that lack of a conclusion. I've been waiting for the end of the Eragon saga for a couple of years now and I was not aware that the series had be extended to four books, so the words \\"The story will continue and conclude in book four.\\" were a shock. But rest assured, when the fourth book comes out I will be one of the first in line to buy it.
B00006JU7T|4.0|It was Al Pacino's first big screen masterpiece of acting. The Godfather was really Marlon Brando's showcase vehicle, and The Godfather, Part Two was a year away, while Dog Day Afternoon, also with Lumet, was another year further out. Pacino's Frank Serpico covers alot of ground in his time on the force, and the two and a quarter hour film moves so briskly that it seems much longer, but in the good sense. As a biopic, it wisely focuses on the meat of the man's public impact, not a cradle to grave psychodrama. We see the thousand little ways that corruption breeds and spreads. Not only is evident it out and out graft and bribery, but in parking ticket quotas, freeby lunches, and the like of countless seemingly harmless acts. Serpico will have none of it, as he is shunted from precinct to precinct, and mocked by his fellow cops as a goody-goody, untrustworthy, and dangerous- all because he's decent and ethical. The non-stop harassment eats away at his insides and his mind, destroys his relationships with women, and lands him on a mission to clean things up, by whatever means he can.<br /><br />  However, bureaucracy slows down his quest, until he connects with another cop, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts), who guides him across minefields of political machinations, until they both decide to go public to the New York Times. Consequently, Serpico is abandoned on a drug bust, by his partners, and shot in the face- the point at which the film begins, then proceeds to its coda. The film ends with Serpico going public at the Knapp Commission hearings, and then we get the credits telling us of the aftermath. Sidney Lumet had a perfect grasp of the streets and the times in this film, and the old clich&eacute;s about them not making films like this any more is true. Compare this to the Academy Award-level `issues' films of recent vintage- The Hours, Million Dollar Baby, Monster, or this year's Brokeback Mountain- and there's simply no comparison. Realistic, but poetic, films like this are just not made by the damnable Hollywood machine any longer. And few independent films can afford the budget and time needed to craft so meticulous a work- Joe Carnahan's recent Ray Liotta vehicle Narc being a welcome exception. Yet, films like this, Dog Day Afternoon, The French Connection, The Conversation, Taxi Driver, All The President's Men, Apocalypse Now, and the like, still tug at the American psyche. Surely, there will be a time in the not-too distant future that such films will be welcome again?made by the damnable Hollywood machine any longer.

B001DDBCUU|1.0|Since I enjoyed the HBO series, the movie was really a let-down. Let me count the ways.<br /><br />We're supposed to believe that Miranda can sit in a taxi outside Carrie's apartment and force her to talk to her when Carrie shuts her out, but Big never does? Big can't bring himself to just go knock on Carrie's door for almost a year??<br /><br />We're supposed to believe that Big even wants Carrie back after she becomes a psycho crazy bitch and beats him on the street with her bouquet? He was willing to go back. He wanted to talk. She knew from their conversation the night before that he needed to know it was just the two of them, and she was still going through with the circus wedding, and she couldn't hear him out?<br /><br />Of the four of them, the one you see naked having sex is Miranda?!!! That must have been as scary on the big screen as Sarah Jessica's nose and chin, which are getting more and more witch-like as she gets older and more gaunt.<br /><br />They gave the lovely Kristin Davis yet another diarrhea scene??!! She already did that in the TV series. Give the girl a break. And it had no real plot point except to make Carrie laugh.<br /><br />How did Jennifer Hudson win an Oscar when she can't act?<br /><br />Samantha is a sexually independent and free-spirited woman who wants to concentrate on herself, and yet she'll lay on a table covered in sushi for more than an hour waiting for Smith to come home? How is this sexually liberated? This is just profoundly stupid. Smith let her go so easily, I suspected he had enough of her, too.<br /><br />I don't see how any woman can identify with these women who waste so much money on foolish clothes just because they're designer brands, and too much expensive jewelry, in this economy. No good works being done here. Just selfish consumerism.<br /><br />Maybe a better movie would have been Big losing all his money in a stock market crash and Carrie having to support him. And how come her friends don't mind that she writes all about their private lives and makes money off it? And uses their real names in her book?<br /><br />And how in the world does Steve still love Miranda when she treats him so poorly, doesn't sleep with him for six months...when he had the beautiful Debbie who adored him? Steve should have just kept his mouth shut. Miranda pays so little attention to him, she wouldn't notice if he had his one-night stands in their living room.<br /><br />The prince charming in Sex and the City was Aidan, but Carrie truly was not good enough for him.<br /><br />And what was with the kiss between Mario Cantone and the guy who plays Sanford. Are they lovers now, but that whole subplot got cut? There were so many other things that could have gotten cut, like fashion week, or Carrie trying on the wedding gowns.<br /><br />Re: Samantha's neighbors in California -- do all the women in California have bodies mostly made of plastic and silicone?d uses their real names in her book?

141694740X|2.0|While this book was an entertaining read, it was above all inaccurate. When I finished reading this book, the impression I got was, unless he buys you a diamond ring on your 3 month anniversary, or lets 12 hours go by before calling after a date, he's just not that into you. Oh, ok. So if he leaves towels on my bathroom floor, it MUST be because he's not that into me, versus the obvious fact that he's lazy when it comes to hanging up towels.<br /><br />If I were a man and a woman I was interested in avoided doing any work in the relationship whatsoever to test how interested I was, believe me, it wouldn't last long.
B000P0J0AG|3.0|The film, much hyped for the first onscreen meeting of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, opens with an only in Hollywood heist of an armored bank truck. The newest member of the gang- Waingro (Kevin Gage)- panics, which results in the murder of the 3 guards. De Niro's character, Neil McCauley, the gang's leader, attempts to kill the screw up, but he escapes. Meanwhile, Vincent Hanna (Pacino), LAPD homicide expert, takes over the case. Needless digressions include Hanna's failing marriage with his faithless wife Justine (Diane Venora) & suicidal stepdaughter (Natalie Portman), Waingroe's revelation as a serial killer of prostitutes, McCauley's contrived and sparkless romance with a lonely bookworm 25 years his junior, Eady (Amy Brenneman), & the backstory of the newest member of the gang. If the long and superfluous digressions are not bad enough, the implausible action scenes & character interactions are worse- this is an absolutely abominable screenplay, folks. Here are just some of the implausibilities: after figuring out that McCauley's thieves have turned the tables on him Hanna stops McCauley, who absurdly agrees to a cup of joe with him. This is the big `Clash of Titans' the film hypes, but is as realistic as John Ashcroft breaking bread with Osama bin Laden. Instead, we get insipid dick on the table banter as Hanna warns McCauley he just might have to `take him out'. McCauley counters, `Oh yeah? I just might have to take you out.' It would have been a hoot had McCauley replied, `You talkin' to me?', but no such luck....  In short, Heat is a mediocre movie at best- its visual style accounting for whatever props it deserves. It was only 2 years later that the brilliant L.A. Confidential came along & showed America what a truly great crime film could be. As for the DVD itself? It's no-frills- there's no commentary, 3 trailers, but the actual transfer of the film print is very clean, as is the sound quality. Curiously, the DVD package seems to recapitulate the making of the film: great attention paid to the shine, but a fairly hollow core.<br />  I waited years to see this film because it was so overhyped, just like I waited years to see the abominable Schindler's List. Heat is not that bad, but post-9/11 this sort of juvenilia all seems kind of unreal.of the film: great attention paid to the shine, but a fairly hollow core.<br />  I waited years to see this film because it was so overhyped, just like I waited years to see the abominable Schindler's List.

1400064287|4.0|Made to Stick provides a simple guide for constructing messages that will engage your audience and endure in their memory. It offers strategies for creating meaningful messages that translate knowledge into action. The six principles of \\"sticky\\" ideas--Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotional, and Stories--are the kind of common sense strategies writers already know but don't always apply. Made to Stick is based on the idea that becoming a good writer is a matter of nurture, rather than nature, and aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The real impact of this book is in its many and varied examples of sticky ideas, ranging from urban legends and fables to the Jared/Subway advertisements and Truth anti-smoking campaigns. The sidebar activities in each chapter also give practical instruction on how to turn mediocre writing samples into sticky ones. Whether you're an experienced writer or a beginner, this book provides concrete criteria for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of your writing.  Simplicity -- To be sticky, an idea must be stripped down to its core, free from competing non-essential information.   Unexpectedness -- Surprise or suspense reveals to listeners the gaps in their knowledge and keeps them wanting more information.  Concretness -- Concepts that are tied to tangible examples or images, for example proverbs and fables, endure in our memory longer than the concepts alone.  Credibility -- If a new idea is outside of the audience's schema of what's true, the communicator needs to build authority for the idea.  Emotion -- Caring about an idea is what motivates the audience put information into action.  Stories -- Stories are an engaging way to pass on information, provide mental simulation, inspire, and dispel skepticism.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Despite what many have said about KB2 being better it's not. It's an ok film that narratively stands on its own, but shows the utter superfluity of KB1, which could have had its backstory sliced to a 6 or 7 minute prologue. KB2 opens with the Bride ready to take on Bill's own baby brother- the 3rd member of the Assassins, Budd (Michael Madsen). After stalking him to his trailer home he blows her away with a buckshot of salt. Why he does not kill her with regular bullets is a silly question since this is comic book logic. Additionally, he offers to turn over the Bride's body to Bill's last assassin for $1 million. She's another blonde killer femme, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who is missing an eye & wears a patch. Cue classic 1930s serial film villain stupidity: Budd buries the Bride alive. He even gives her a flashlight in her nailed coffin. Flashback: to her training under misogynistic Chinese Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This is needless digression because the stereotyped character- similar to KB1's involving the Bride's training with master swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba)- adds nothing to the tale that could not have been added in a few casual throwaway references in the script.<br />  Length is also a big problem. The 2 films run 226 minutes, or just a quarter hour shy of 4 hours. They were originally to be a single entity but, having had so few films from Tarantino over the years his company wanted to double the bang for the buck. Thus the  mishmash editing. Individual scenes are expertly paced and woven, but there are just reams of scenes that do not advance the essential shark-like plot. This is not just taste speaking- too many scenes with trivial but wannabe colorful characters grind the film to a snail's pace. Trim the 90 minutes of KB1 down to 20 or 30 minutes of action, trim the 136 minutes of the plodding KB2 in half & you would've had a very good 90-100 minute film with all the excellent action and revelatory scenes intact. The KB films are a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness). Another thing gained by making the films one would be that the teaser at the end of KB1, where we find out Beatrix has a daughter, could be cut and that revelation unfold to both character and audience when she actually confronts Bill. Not that the emotion would have overwhelmed, but knowing this fact about Beatrix before she does castrates whatever empathy we might feel for her near the film's climax.<br />  That Tarantino did not see these points, or did but gave in to them, seems to support my belief that he has yet to show the maturity of a great director. He seemed to be going in the right direction with Jackie Brown (easily his best & most mature film) but has regressed with the 2 Kill Bills. Of KB2 I'd grade it 65 of 100, & for the duo of films I'd give it a 75. I hope I'm wrong, but he seems destined, and satisfied, to be merely an A director of B films.e a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness).

Leads us to a greater understanding of how to develop a deep and loving relationship with our dogs based on understanding.  Also leads to practical training advice.

B000000OSG|5.0|Honestly, I liked Illusion II more than I liked Illusion I, and I really like the first one.  Starting with the epic Civil War, which opens with a very cool soundclip from Cool Hand Luke, and going through until the butt-kicking My World, this one delivers!    Another aspect I love is track 7, Breakdown.  On the cassette, it is the finale of side one. Coming in at seven minutes and four seconds in length and featuring a sound clip from the film Vanishing Point, the song is quite epic in it's own right.  But, in the context of the CD, it flows fairly well into the following track, Pretty Tied Up.  So it sounds great either way.    Features the hits Yesterdays, Knocking on Heaven's Door, Estranged, and You Could Be Mine.
B001FL88AC|5.0|Okay, my first introduction to Captain Beefheart was Frownland off of Trout Mask Replica.  I hated it the first time I heard it.  It made my wife angry.  Now, I have since grown to appreciate it, but I probably would have done so faster if I'd heard Safe as Milk first.  This album is far more accessible and gives you a real appreciation for the musicianship.  It's actually a fantastic album from start to finish.  I'm now a Beefheart fan.  You will be too if you give this a listen.

B00003CXB4|4.0|Every day when I wake up in the morning and I see the sun shining so beautifully and so brightly in the sky, I begin singing to myself \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and I know that my day will go well and somehow I'll find a way to make the world a better place and I owe it all to this film.  You see, this is a wonderful movie about bringing animals together. Simba is going to be king, only his nasty uncle, Scar, has other ideas and concocts a plan to kill Simba and his father, Mufasa. Fortunately, only Mufasa dies and Simba is scared off into the desert and told never to return.  Now, this is where the movie gets oh so incredibly good because Simba meets my two favorite characters in the film: Timon and Pumbaa, a weasel and a warthog. Nathan Lane does the voice of Timon and every time I hear him, it makes me smile. This is where we get to hear the song \\"Hakuna Matata,\\" which means no worries. This is such an important lesson for everyone, especially with the troubles in the Middle East right now with all the people who hate freedom. See, if you have no worries then you don't have any problems. Of course, Simba takes this a little too far because he ignores his responsibilities. This is where the wonderful song \\"Circle of Life\\" comes in. Later, when Nala shows up, we get to hear \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight.\\" I know I could!  Really, when you think about it, this film teaches us how music can heal the world because every time you hear a song, you learn an important lesson. The greatest parts of the film, I think, are that we get to see monkeys and lions living in peace and harmony and when Mufasa comes to Simba in a vision, it's like Obi Wan Kenobi from \\"Star Wars\\" and whenever I think of \\"Star Wars\\" I get a big smile on my face.  You'll feel kingly watching \\"The Lion King\\"!

I've read almost all of the Bosch mysteries, and this is my favorite. Since he's investigating a cold case-his mother's murder-it gives readers more insight into Harry's character as formed by life with his mother and after her death, as well as the ensuing events in his life. As always, Michael Connelly's prose is gorgeous.

William Orbit is a great producer and the combination of him with Madonna is pure gold. Impressive Instant is my favorite track on the album, and I also love Paradise (not for me) and Nobody's perfect. The book-let is a sorry story and that is such a shame. No lyrics. Very few photos. Still this is an amazing record that should not be missed!

Yes, the book-let is a strange one. Harrison in purple boots, big brown hat surrounded by gnomes. Harrison has also written a very well-written and thought worthy essay regarding the recording.  I love the photographs and one can see that he was a very pensive and cerebral man. This is a recording not to be missed.

Sharon Robinson plays all the instruments except Bob Metzger's guitar on \\"my secret life\\". I do not agree that the heavy use of synths makes the record sterile. Instead I think the synths and Cohens magic and magnificient blend and create a sound that is filled with sollace. The book-let is really nice. The cover is a little strange, but artistic without being annoying. The font sellected is easy on the eye and the font is easy to read.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I'm sure many people have reviewed this album and said the same things I will. I don't need to go into UBER detail on this album, but I want to say a couple things.<br /><br />1. Metallica has reversed their position on electronic music-sharing.  They made their entire album available to listen on their site after it was released.  Before it was released, they \\"leaked\\" 6 full songs on their website.  They like the Internet, and I think it likes them back.<br /><br />2. This album has some MUSICALITY ON IT!!!!!  Not since ...And Justice for All have we seen dynamics mixed with some shred, like we see on this album.  St. Anger was angry, ok.  But the screamed lyrics were boring and repetitive. This album has screaming, singing, and everything in between.  The music is composed, rather than just written.  Listen to The Day That Never Comes, and tell me the guys weren't thinking about Fade to Black and One when they wrote it!  Seriously, Metallica has returned to their roots on this one.<br /><br />I'm not a BIG fan of the recent stuff, though I thought even Load and Reload had some good rock on it.  But it wasn't really Metallica.  Death Magnetic is, and it is soooooo good to hear them back.
B00026WU4G|4.0|Infidels is a good album but not his best. It was produced as a collobartion between Mark Knopfler and Dylan. Then one would have expected it to be a tremendus recording. It is not bad by any means but not amazing by any means which is a shame. If one compares this would a classic like Highway 61 Revisited, it feels a bit flat. Still Dylan is an accomplished lyricist and writes several great tracks. For instance, one track that I particularly like is License to Kill. The book-let is a drab and to be frank it is atrocious. The drawing on the back looks shoddy and must have been drawn by a friend since otherwise Dylan should ask for his money back.
031606792X|5.0|This book is a great escape from life and an enjoyable, quick read.  In my opinion, it flows along nicely with the other three books and does not change drastically in what it is all about.  This is a happy series about true love.  No, it is not deep and no, it is not realistic, but it is a fantasy and should be treated as such.  If you are expecting an epic book that will alter the way you look at the world, buy something else, but if you want to be entertained and left with a happy feeling, then this is for you.
B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top is the eclectic Texas blues/boogie and hard rock band that features the two front men (Billy Gibbons on guitar, Dusty Hill on bass) with trademark dark sunglasses and very long full beards. Drummer Frank Beard has no beard. All three are original members from the band's inception as a cosmic cowboy blues/hard rock trio in 1969. Billy Gibbons is widely respected as one of the best electric blues/rock guitarists in the business.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002LSV ZZ Top - Greatest Hits]] (1992) mostly covers the trio's 1980s techno-boogie working-class chic MTV years, but that doesn't mean that this collection isn't worthy. On the contrary, this is great stuff that any true ZZ Top fan would like. Sure, they use drum machines and electronics on a lot of these songs, but Billy Gibbons' loud and bluesy guitar and humorously sly vocals are still front and center, and everything here is unmistakably ZZ Top.<br /><br />The collection does briefly touch on the band's early years. La Grange, Tush, Cheap Sunglasses and I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide are all from the band's Tex-Mex blues and boogie years in the seventies, but unfortunately the classic Waiting For The Bus/Jesus Just Left Chicago wasn't included, and that is why I docked this collection 1/2 star. That's an unforgivable oversight, but it doesn't steal all the joy from this set. There is still a lot of good ZZ Top music here. Gimme All Your Lovin', Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, My Head's In Mississippi, Rough Boy, Tube Snake Boogie and much more. They even threw in a couple of new songs, Gun Love and their version of Elvis' Viva Las Vegas.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002LSV ZZ Top - Greatest Hits]] includes eighteen songs, and if you're in the mood for hearing ZZ Top music from their highly successful MTV years, this covers the era as well as it really needs to. I'm a fan of the band's early years (Tres Hombres is my favorite ZZ Top album), but I like this era as well. So while I mostly listen to the early stuff, every now and then I'll break out [[ASIN:B000002LSV ZZ Top - Greatest Hits]] and recall all of those cool ZZ Top videos that were on MTV in those days and rock out Tejas style.B000002LSV ZZ Top - Greatest Hits]] and recall all of those cool ZZ Top videos that were on MTV in those days and rock out Tejas style.
B000MCIBAW|4.0|This quickly succeeded  sophomore release is possibly the closest Morrison and crew ever came again to putting out a disc as solid as their legendary self-titled, and although it does have a few less then perfect entries and perhaps tries to mimic the original formula, most of the songwriting and effortless, innovative band interaction still astonishes with an assured vision never really captured quite the same again in rock.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best albums I have heard in years. It is excellent the first time you hear it and it gets better everytime after that.<br />Maybe it's Jack White, maybe it's all of them combined, but if you are a fan of good solid music, you will love this.<br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
0553804677|5.0|I read hard boiled crime and Science Fiction and I view most fantasy as idiotic. Elves? Middle Earth? Good grief. If I live long enough I will see the development of FTL Travel, time travel, android girlfriends, flying cars and a lot of other cool stuff I can read about right now. Sure, I'm going to have to live a long time to pull this off but as soon as immortality is developed, it won't be a problem.<br /><br />This book, The Lies of Locke Lamora is quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. A REAL 5-star book. Edge of the seat excitement. A dizzying array of plots, sub-plots and sub-sub-plots so well arranged that you can easily keep track of everything. This \\"fantasy\\" now stands side by side with the likes of [[ASIN:B0015DK4ZM Altered Carbon]],  [[ASIN:0765350483 The Skinner]] and  [[ASIN:1400030927 Jennifer Government]] on a revered altar in the underwater cathedral I built to house the worlds greatest books. I'm so hard to please that I have less than 20 5-star books although I have 4 and 4.5 star books to tide me over between the 5-star eras.<br /><br />The storyline has been well covered in other reviews. I just want to make sure my fellow sci-fi brothers and sisters don't miss out. Just go buy it now. Trust me on this.<br /><br />Oh, let me plug a couple of my other 5-stars.

B0016OMFPW|5.0|As usual, Roy delivers a 5+ star performance. This CD is in continuous play in my car, and has been since the day it came out.    The other gem on this recording is Gerald Clayton. He is one incredible jazz pianist; watch for his CD to come out soon as I have no doubts that it will be 5 star as well. Gerald and Roy are playing together more and more, and they compliment each other like no other two musicians that I have ever heard.    As fantastic as this CD is, there is no comparison to hearing Hargrove live. I have seen him on several occasions and he brings down the house every time! He is respectful of the other musicians on the stage, and he bleeds talent. Pay any amount and make any effort to see him. You'll come away from his performance just wanting more more more.
B000002GBK|1.0|'Bombast!' the famous pianist Richard Wakeman cried out. 'I put out a great album with orchestra and choir on it, and they call it bombast!'  The record people nodded.  'But I'll get 'em', Wakeman continued grimly. 'Here comes another one. With even more bombast on it. They want bombast, bombast is what they'll get!'  The record people nodded.  'I'll call it Bombast', Wakeman concluded triumphantically.  The record people nodded.  And so it came out. It was called The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table. Well, the record people said, we can shorten it to TMALOKAAHKOTRT. But, they all agreed, that didn't mean much. Certainly not more than the music.

0060555661|4.0|The Margin of Safety principle is probably the main thing to get from this book. The book gives many comparisons and instructive historical examples, but is a bit lacking in terms of actual advise on how to conduct an analysis, even though the book was supposedly aimed at the layman reader.    I would recommend browsing this book and focus mainly on the two chapters already recommended by Warren Buffett, namely the chapter about stock market fluctuations and the chapter about margin of safety. Concerning the overall philosophy of long-term investing I prefer Phil Fisher's book: Common Stocks and Uncommon profits.      In addition you will also need a proper book on valuation, although Graham does give a very simple valuation formula, I feel it is too focused on earnings (that is, the 'net income' which is often deceptive due to depreciation, new investments, etc.), and I personally prefer a proper Discounted Cash Flow model. Check my other reviews if I should one day post a review for a good book on valuation.

B0000AK7AA|2.0|Yet another dopey kiddie movie with almost nothing to offer the parents who have to sit in the theater because their little munchkins wanted to see this stuff.  Honestly, why don't family movies aim a little higher?  Pixar has proven over and over again that it's possible to make a smart, funny movie that people of all ages can enjoy.  Anyway..    I do not own Casper on DVD; I saw it in the theater.  I don't even remember why I went to see this; it was probably a family outing, but I might have gone because I'm a fan of animation.  Bleh.  The ghosts looked lame, the story was full of holes, the characters were shallow & two-dimensional, the acting was mediocre.  The only reason I'm even reviewing this turkey is because of the set design.    That's right, I said set design.  I was way more excited by the Casper _house_ than by the foolery that was taking place in it.  The sets were heavily inspired by the work of late-1800s Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi (the organic, spirally ceiling in the girl's bedroom is a direct quote from an apartment building in Barcelona.)  I thought initially the Gaudi references were just a fluke, that they accidentally used his style as a single piece in what was going to be an incoherent Art Nouveau collage ... but every interior shot, every new area of the house looked like a fanciful (but faithful) interpretation of Gaudi's style (except the basement, which didn't match at all.)  I was amazed that somebody took the effort to reference a particular architect and maintain a plausible pastiche of his style throughout.  I had never really paid a lot of attention to movie set design before, but this show was so forgettable that I found it easy to look at the backdrops instead.  Also helps that I knew about Gaudi and was an admirer of his idiosyncratic work long before seeing the movie.    Casper's set designer gets five stars, but this lame movie only deserves two.  Highly recommended as a visual reference for eccentric Art Nouveau interiordesign.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My fiance and I don't have TV, so we rent all of the television shows that we watch. I rented the first season when my fiance was out of town, and I watch the whole season in one night! I don't usually like \\"scary\\" things, but I was hooked. When my fiance got back home, he watched the whole first season in one night too. We bought both the first and second season off of Amazon, and we have been watching them almost every night since.<br />It is a great, original show. It's a nice break from the traditional cop shows like Law and Order (though I have to admit I love SVU). The character development is fabulous! You are really able to relate to the characters and understand their motivations. My favorite part is all of the surprising twists!

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is a gem.  With stunning visuals, and beautiful imagery, the story is whimsical, clever, charming, sad and wonderfully funny.   The performances were incredible as well,  especially that of the little girl, Catinca Untaru. She plays a young girl hospitalized and entertained by the fantastic stories of a fellow patient.  Catina's performance is so natural and honest, you can relate to her, it's amazing.

B001DDBCUA|4.0|OK, needless to say you need to be a fan of the show to enjoy the film.    I liked the film, but I did NOT love it.    TOO LONG.     The part about Big & the wedding.  Carrie was being Carrie & this upset him?  She IS INTO the clothes, style, etc & she is being herself &he does not like it.    IN this movie Carrie has NO financial problems.  Just now had written 3 books.  Throughout the show we heard her max out  her credit card for shoes/clothes.      They could have made Candace Bergen in her 1 brief scene look a little more done up.  Made her look like an old woman working at \\"Vogue\\".    For woman THE MUCH TALKED ABOUT \\"FULL MONTY\\" MALE SCENE.  If you blink you will miss that part & it is in later in the film, NOT LIKE CLIPPING SHOW IT LEADS PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IT IS.    The Miranda & Steve storyline we knew about before the film opened.  Storybook ending.    Stanford & Anthony did NOT like each other in the series, what is the difference here?    Charlotte & Harry were just supporting characters in this.  Hinted before the film opened she would FINALLY have a kid & does.  NO SURPRISE.  The small good Charlotte moment when she gets to confront \\"Big\\" Chris Noth.  NEEDED THAT TO BE LONGER.    I was totally unhappy how the Samantha & Smith storyline ended.   While watching the film end you keep hoping for that storybook ending.  You get disappointed.    Jennifer Hudson's character I liked, she needed to be in it longer.      A good effort but NOT as good as you would expect the film to be.    DVD package.  NO chapter search list.  Just an advertisement & coupon for a digital copy.
0553582038|2.0|A Feast for Crows was a huge disappointment to almost everyone. GRRM new it was a pretty poor effort and he offered some weak explanations in his web site - the entire work was too long for one volume, Dances with Dragons was coming soon, he had writer's block, he had to go to this convention and that convention, yadda, yadda, yadda....... I'm pretty angry that GRRM, whom we all thought would fill the void created when Robert Jordan turned into a literary prima donna, seems so dismissive of readers' frustration with the time between books and the short comings of Feast For Crows.  Is there any point in my or other readers getting angry?  Probably not.  GRRM will finish Dances With Dragons in his own good time, and readers will buy it as quickly as drug addicts going through withdrawal.  If Dances With Dragons does not get the series back on track I'm finished with it.  I won't get sucked into another Wheel Of Time morass.
B001C3KCSY|2.0|I'm probably one of the older fans of the band and after hearing this I feel like I've been dumped for someone much younger.  The first few songs are ok but If I had never heard the KOL earlier material I would have thought this band was something more along the lines of an edgy Jonas brothers.  The songs sound very manufactured, almost as if the label got involved and had a focus group telling them how to sell to the MTV crowd.    The song Revelry in particular really bugs me.  I'm a huge fan of a song named Melissa from the Allman Brothers and Revelry sounds like a bad clone.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|After reading so many negative reviews for this product I was a little worried about the discs when they arrived. As most people had said it was the packaging that damages the discs I instantly bought something else to move the discs to. I did notice some of them didn't look perfect but was being optimistic.     When I went home I tested the discs out.. now although I haven't watched every episode yet I did test every disc and watched part of an episode on each disc and it seems my discs are all ok. I do agree with all the other posters that while the packaging looks great the slots the DVDs actually sit in are stupid and they definitely can affect the discs.

Sent to the arena with the baker's son and classmate, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who, several years prior, saved Kat and her family from the ravages of starvation after her father's death in a coal mining accident -- neither competitor from the final district seem to be contenders.<br /><br />But Peeta's good nature and Kat's small stature belie the former's cunning intelligence and the latter's experience as a hunter; while a revelation from Peeta during the introductory ceremonies sends Katniss into the first day of competition more than a little off-kilter.<br /><br />The stage is set, the tributes have arrived, and the cameras are watching...let the games begin.<br /><br />It is no exaggeration to call THE HUNGER GAMES a pulse-pounding page-turner. Collins grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go. While Katniss isn't always the most likable character (in fact, there were plenty of times I much preferred the affable Peeta, or even sweet, birdlike little Ruth), she is always compelling, thanks to her rational approach to every challenge and her dogged determination.<br /><br />While THE HUNGER GAMES is a plot-driven novel, the characters and their relationships are the heart of the story.  Ms. Collins has created a dystopian tale of Orwellian caliber for young adults, giving any reader plenty to churn their minds between now and the next installment of this trilogy.<br /><br />My only complaint is having to wait for the next installment.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Catonly complaint is having to wait for the next installment.

0671449028|4.0|I love Sandra Boynton. I love the illustrated characters, the simple rhymes and so, evidently, do children. The Going to Bed Bed Book looked perfect for my toddler at bed time, so I couldn't resist picking it up recently at a local bookstore. The board-book format means less destruction, so if you can just keep 'em from chewing it, the book should last a long time.<br /><br />The short rhyming story follows the adorable cartoon characters as they go through their bedtime routine. They take their baths, put on their pajamas and brush their teeth. Now this is the part where I had a teensy problem...after brushing their teeth, the characters all go and exercise before going to bed. Now I don't know about you, but a two-year-old exercising before bedtime around here is a recipe for...well...a two-year-old not going to sleep. So I freely admit that I kind of skip that page.<br /><br />But the very last lines make up for it:<br /><br />  \\"The moon is high. The sea is deep. They rock and rock and rock to sleep.\\"<br /><br />It is at this point that I usually drift off and my son has to jar me awake so I can kiss him goodnight.<br /><br />I do recommend the book if you don't have a problem with the exercise bit or if you have a child who does NOT feel the need to mimic everything they see or read. It really is a lovely toddler's book for either gender.
0385340990|4.0|This entire book is composed of letters written to and from Juliet Ashton, an English author who is looking for a new subject to write about at the end of World War II.  She receives a letter from a man who has bought one of her old Charles Lamb books and has found her name and address inside the cover.  Thus begins a fascinating correspondence between her and several members of a literary society on the island of Guernsey.  They describe their life under the German occupation and they pique her curiosity to the point that she goes to visit them.  She is enchanted by the people she meets there and she begins a whole new life.  Although I found the letter-writing format a little tedious at times, the story itself is an interesting and charming one.
0312382464|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I read it very quickly and was engrossed.  I never ever cry or continue to think about a particular part of a book like I did this one.  The people who read probably know what I am talking about but I do not want to give anything away.  The characters were brought about wonderfully, because you hate them and love them, you cheer them on and you want to hit them.  Great book, would recommend to anyone who likes historical books without the feel of a textbook.
031606792X|1.0|I was rather disappointed with Breaking Dawn. I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books of the series, and still do, but I found that Breaking Dawn was lacking.<br /><br />It's not the crack plot. Because, oh yes, the plot is crack filled tomfoolery.<br /><br />It's not the disturbing birth of Renesmee. Which I doubt could ever be made into a movie appropriate for teen girls.<br /><br />It's the ending. She spends the majority of the book building up to this big battle, and then resolves it all in under fifty pages. Less than twenty, really. It's all \\"oh, now we're going to have to fight. Here we come. We're going to fight. Look, we're poking each other. Here it comes! Here...\\" and then it ends.<br /><br />It's a disappointment and I expected better.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|Obviously there are 2 camps on this album and I understand them both. The first 2 albums were absolutely amazing with their own formula of nose to the grindstone 3 minute diddies which I still enjoy returning to.  Then came \\"Because of the Times\\" which took me a few listens before it grew on me in large way - no doubt they had grown and were trying some new things and they worked.  I am soaking in the new album and think there are some real gems on here - different formula from first 2 albums, but still good. No doubt if you listen to the album on random you can end up listening to 4 slow-churners in a row which is typically not why you listen to KOL.  I do take exception to the fact that people are saying that KOL is selling out or trying to break into mainstream. I know they have commented recently that they are disappointed that US fan base has not caught up to rest of the world but they are NOT SELLING OUT!. At the end of the day, they are creative musicians who would probably have hung it up already if they played the same type of music over and over...They are probably the best US band (along with Foo and Raconteurs) there is, let them do their thing, they will not disappoint!!!

It combines beautiful pictures of animals with simple rhythmic text showing body parts and actions -- turning heads, bending necks, raising shoulders, arching backs and others.

B000002UAU|5.0|Not only was Sargeant Peppers one of the greatest albums ever released but it also proved at a time when The Beatles were thought to be finished - dried up and all out of ideas - they were just getting started. The drama surrounding this album couldn't have been scripted any better if it had been a full length feature film. Take a rock band which had become the biggest and best of all time and had the world at its' young feet. Every album that they put out was critically and generally accepted as important with every song on each a gem in and of itself. Add to that the incredible cultural influence The Beatles had on the world and I do mean the entire world. They were bigger than life itself. There was so much press on this band constantly from the beginnings of Beatlemania right on up to the eve of Sargeant Pepper's release. It seems as though by the time the lull between The Beatles' last release (Revolver) and their then future release of Sargeant Peppers had extended itself, everyone was pretty much listening for the fall. You know the adage: the bigger they are the harder they fall? Rumours were spreading that The Beatles didn't have any more ideas. The logic was that no one could sustain the kind of career these 'boys' had sustained for that long and still have anything new or worthwhile to say. The rumours were helped by the long silence from The Beatles after Revolver. It did seem like aeons at the time, since they had released Revolver and given their prodigious production through the years, it just wasn't like them to \\"slow up\\" like that. In retrospect, McCartney claims that he had relished the press comments about The Beatles being finished and dried up, etc. at the time. This because he of course, was privy to what The Beatles were doing in the studio and the direction they were taking. Indeed, his personal attitude was, 'just you wait'. Of course, history tells us that The Beatles were far from being dried up and the praises which followed its release were astounding. Again the band that had changed life for everyone in the world, especially the young, were doing it again. Sargeant Peppers was the work of a very confident (maybe even cocky) band who refused to allow themselves to become prisoners of their own successes. So many could have and would have lived on their laurels having had one tenth the success these guys experienced. And quite frankly, it could have been justified if they had. However, The Beatles was a living, breathing, and growing organism the entire time of their existence. When they couldn't grow anymore, they imploded and that implosion served their position in history very well. They never became the parodies of themselves that it would have been so easy to become. They came, they sang, they went! Sargeant Peppers was another hallmark album in the string of those already achieved by the band and those which were still unborn but coming. If you haven't yet, you must. Don't miss out on what is still an incredibly enjoyable, wonderful album full of some of the greatest songs ever written. Again, like all things Beatles, there are no throwaway songs on this album.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|Randy Crawford is a jazz legend and has been around for decades.  She has followed the current genres throughout touching pop, light dance music etc. but she is ultimately a true jazz purist and looking over her entire career she shines.  She made one of her greatest hits 30 years ago with Joe Sample and the Crusaders on STREET LIFE.  A great song and here they are again - Randy Crawford and Joe Sample - two legends doing an entire cd together.<br /><br />One might expect two masters such as these to rest on their laurels a little bit and put minimal effort in.  Instead, here we get on of the best sets in the careers of both artists.  The album is very eclectic and Randy leaves the pop influence behind and attacks each track as a true jazz artist, sometimes bluesy, always smooth.  Her voice is pure and strong, always emotive as the small backing music led by the amazing acoustic piano work of Joe Sample give her the floor.<br /><br />Randy redoes some of her classics like RIO DE JANIERO BLUE and LAST NIGHT AT DANCELAND.  To listen to these tracks here shows how seriously she is taking this project.  Her voice soars and her immense range is fully realized and it is as if each song is being sung for the first time.  The set is very eclectic.  There are some pop songs like WHEN I NEED YOU but it leaves pop territory and becomes pure jazz here.<br /><br />I'll admit it took me a couple of listens to get into this cd but then it became pure magic.  Now it is one of the best jazz collections I have ever heard.  You must listen to each track one at a time for each song is a true emotional experience.  I am a true Randy Crawford fan and must say she demonstrates some vocals here that left me in awe.  BUT BEAUTIFUL, LOVETOWN, TELL ME MORE AND THEN SOME and MR. UGLY are truly amazing.<br /><br />This cd is not only about FEELING GOOD.  It is so much more than that.  I think this cd was truly Grammy worthy and should have been recognized and is not only a must for Randy Crawford/Joe Sample fans but also true jazz fans and for people who just love great music.<br /><br />This cd is a rare gift of two legends giving their all for an ultimate experience.jazz fans and for people who just love great music.

I am sure that I cannot add much to the proceedings so let me just say this: even the songs that I had wondered previously as to why they were included (Wild Honey Pie and Why Don't We Do It In the Road to name two)sound good in 2008. The Beatles were always several steps ahead of everyone in their music making. This album only goes to prove that in some cases, their vision extended years and years ahead of everyone. But eventually, a cat sitting down to write the one thousandth review of this cd on amazon.com catches up!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show hits its stride in season two, after the overrated first season.  Everything just feels more balanced and cohesive-Dexter's personal life, his secret life, the goings on at the police department, etc.  I felt there were moments in season one where it came dangerously close to seeming like CSI for Showtime.  Here the subplots are more compelling and seamlessly integrated with the main story arc.  Overall, I still think its a bit overrated, but this is a great DVD set.  For 24.99 you get 12 eps (which are like an hour each, not 43 minutes like other stuff), AND two episodes of Brotherhood, AND PC content that includes episodes of The Tudors AND Californication.

B001DPC52C|5.0|As a fan of Within Temptation, I have been waiting for this DVD to come out since they announced the show back in February and now it's finally here. This dvd is brilliant, sure it's not the same as the European release but the main concert is what's important here and it's fantastic. There are no other words to describe the vocals of Sharon den Adel combined with a live orchestra. Within Temptation was made for something like this and I love the new arrangements to some of the songs including \\"Mother Earth\\", \\"Stand My Ground\\", and \\"Angels\\". Adding the pyros, video screens, lights, dancers, and sounds made this one of the best live performances ever captured on film.    This version of Black Symphony contains a cd with 13 live songs and a DVD with the full 22 song concert and a few special features:    Backstage report- a 13 minute interview with the band, crowd, and orchestra before and after the show.    Documentary - runs for about 23 minutes and it features the band discussing a little about their career with rehearsal footage from black symphony.    Countdown - 8 minute overview from the day of the show.    For anyone that wants to know the technical stuff, the show is shot in widescreen and contains 2.0/5.1/DTS sound.    Every fan of Within Temptation must pick this up! You won't regret it.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Maiden seems to have gone in yet another new direction with this one. I get the feeling they are embracing their no radio play at an extreme level. Every song here is long and most have multiple tempo shifts. This makes for a lot of strong moments, but a few weaker ones as well.    Personally, I found Dance of Death and Brave New World to have a few more catchy hooks, but A Matter of Life and Death contains some tremendously deep songs that any Maiden fan should appreciate.
B000U7169M|2.0|The Reaping kinda sucked. The music worked way too hard, heavy, over dramatic in a way that when done right can be hugely affective, like in The Exorcist, but that here was just melodramatic and a little B movie of the week. Suckage also turned out to be a theme because the entire movie was a failure at whatever it actually was attempting. The plot was convoluted, the dialogue was crappy, it wasn't scary and the only reason that I was grossed out was because I made the mistake of eating a grilled cheese sandwich right in the middle of the lake of blood scene. (I have a delicate stomach, yo!)      So, let's make a movie and let's set it in the creepy backwaters of the Louisiana Bayou. We'll fill it with happy, southern people dealing with creepy biblical plagues. Throw in a newly menstruating blonde baby girl with big creepy blue eyes and surely we'll have a hit. Was that the pitch meeting? Did anyone really buy that? Hilary Swank did and I hope that she didn't read the script before she signed on cause the only thing that did work was the aforementioned blonde, blue-eyed creepy girl.    The Reaping fails at what The Skeleton Key excelled at. You're filming in the south in the bayou only kinda not really. I never got that heavy, languid, creepily atmospheric feeling that pervaded the landscape in The Skeleton Key. The Reaping's version of the Louisiana Bayou was sanitized and too bright. Hilary Swank gently perspired, the plantation was being renovated, but maybe most of the work had already been done. There was no peeling paint or squeaky steps, no rotting wood, very little in the way of tangled underbrush. That heavy feeling you get in tropical locales was completely missing.    Having only ever been to Louisiana in the spring and summer maybe I'm missing something and they were filming in the winter.    There was the requisite church songs playing in the background on an old record player, mystical, dreamy maybe sex, suspect heroes and the looming apocalypse. Withall of that you would think that this movie could work it out. It was spliced with dream sequences and jumbled flashbacks that collided and, I suppose, were meant to make a kind of sense and reveal all sorts of super secret information cause hey, jumbled flashbacky dream sequences, what about that doesn't scream CLUE. Unfortunately, the clues only confused us more and we actually paused, re-wound and slow-mo'd through a couple of them. It still didn't really make sense. Not that that was unusual because most of the movie didn't make sense either and we all sat back as the credits rolled to try and piece together what actually happened and how in the heck Hilary Swank ended up carrying the anti-Christ when the entire time we thought the big-eyed blonde girl was the perfect demon child.    Well, as it turns out the blonde, Lauren, was a sort of angel. A second born child embodying the wrath of God, Lauren's purpose is to destroy the evil that's been brewing in Haven, Louisiana for generations. I have to say that I called it as we watched Lauren and Katherine (Hilary Swank) bond over the joy of becoming a woman. I figured that the entire town had been worshipping Satan and that now that they'd \\"reaped\\" (see how they did that) the perfect child they were in a panic because they couldn't actually control her. Well, I was *almost* right. Turns out they were trying to kill her not because they couldn't control her but because she was going to Kill Them All. See, Little Lauren was conjuring the Ten Plagues of Egypt and if you all recall the tenth plague is the Death of the First Borns. Well, Haven just so happened to be a town full of first born's as part of the tenets of their devil worshipping sect.    The entire movie was difficult and mostly silly and I couldn't figure out why Hilary Swank ran around at night in a flowing white skirt. What was that about, really?! Then there was, of course, the one COC, Ben. Ben is Katherine's T.A. from LSU and he's got a Master's degree and he's an educated black man who believes in the Lord (been going to church every Sunday for ten years) and was saved back in the day when he used to be a drug dealer and gang banger and general all around bad man. Of course, he also died. Like I didn't see that one coming.    Dude, seriously?!    Yeah, that's what I said, too.    The only thing that I did like about the movie was AnnaSophia Robb as Lauren McConnell, the angel masquerading as the Anti-Christ. That little girl is beautiful and angelic and creepy all at the same time. With her big, big blue eyes and delicate bone structure she managed to be all of those things that I think Rob Zombie was looking for in Daeg Faerch and failed to find.    Idris Elba did a good job with the crappy dialogue and did a great job creating a generic American accent. Too bad, really, because I think all if not most of the characters were actually supposed to be from Louisiana. David Morrissey was especially bad. DUDE! Seriously creepy southern town in the creepy backwater bayous of Louisiana where \\"every bump in the night is the devil at your back door\\"! Seriously?!    I didn't see the point of paying Stephen Rea to appear in the movie and Hilary Swank took ten steps backwards to play the part. Blessedly it was only 96 minutes, although sadly, those 96 minutes happened to fall smack dab in the middle of Jeopardy.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|I've been a Metallica fan since a friend introduced me to Master of Puppets in 1986. My favorite albums are still the earliest ones, but I still enjoyed the \\"Black Album\\" and even Load and Re-Load had some gems. However, I couldn't stomach St. Anger.    On the whole, I would say Death Magnetic sounds a lot more like a cross between the \\"Black Album\\" and Load/Re-Load. For whatever reason, I just can't get into it. It's certainly a metal album, but not one that seems to be catching my interest. My love affair with Metallica has been a long one...22 years is a pretty good run...but I fear we've simply grown apart.    Maybe it's not you, Metallica, maybe it's me.
B000J10ER4|3.0|No offense to Brian Singer because I really did enjoy the X-Men movies, but I still don't understand who decided that re-making Superman was a good idea. Even more obvious in my head then Micheal Keaton is Batman, Christopher Reeve *is* Superman. It took the phenomenal talent of Christian Bale to shift the idea of who The Batman could be and make me believe it. How could any less be expected of the next actor to fill Reeve's blue tights.    What Christopher Reeve did was to create two separate and individual characters who just happened to be played by the same actor, and although we occasionally see them merge together for a moment or two, brief reminders that Clark Kent is Superman in disguise, it's that dedication to playing them as total polar opposites that makes Reeve's Superman iconic.    Unfortunately, as hot as he is, all Brandon Routh did was to remind me that he isn't Christopher Reeve. He looked the part well enough and mimicked Reeve's performance close enough that I didn't throw popcorn at the screen, but there was nothing that made me think, oh, yes, he is Superman. I was entertained, but mostly I just thought of how much better Christopher Reeve was in the part.    Kate Bosworth never even came close to Margot Kidder's Lois Lane, but then I never expected her to and so there was no real disappointment. It looked like they tried to age Bosworth into the part, which only made her look like a teenager playing dress-up. I didn't believe her as a mother for one minute, but doesn't necessarily require age to make believable. Acting chops, however, would have helped.    The rest of the cast was mostly negligible. I didn't care for the attempt at externalizing the love triangle between Kent, Lois and Superman by introducing James Marsden as Lois's capable, hunky Superman-esque fiance. He was, I think, meant to represent a melding of the two characters and I found that extraneous. Because of the type of film it was, I wasn't expecting Lois to leave her fianc for the Man of Steel and without at least the hint of that possibility, we loose a lot of narrative tension.    Gene Hackman continues to reign supreme as Lex Luthor. Kevin Spacey did nothing to convince me of otherwise. I did, however, adore Parker Posey as Luthor's Pomeranian carrying girlfriend, Kitty. I was initially reminded of Miss Tesmacher in the original Superman, but that didn't last for long. Parker's ditzy, emaciated brunette was just screwball enough to make me forget (or forgive) her similarities to Miss Tesmacher.    Overall, I was surprised that I didn't hate Superman Returns, that I was just entertained enough to watch it til the end and was even invested in him recovering, like we knew he would, from the Kryptonite poisoning (How he managed to lift that giant coral reef of Kryptonite and hurl it into space, I will never understand, especially considering how it was COVERED with Kryptonite AND he had Kryptonite fragments still in his body -- but oh well, handwave, as they say).    Maybe if there hadn't been so many successful re-inventions of the Superman mythology then I would have been more satisfied with the movie. I don't, for example, ever compare Smallville with the Superman movie franchise, or Tom Welling with Christopher Reeve. In my mind they are two different things. Same goes for differences between the films and the cartoons (Animated Series and Justice League). I can only lay blame at the feet of a movie that invoked a superior film without successfully reimagining it into something new and fresh.
B000SNUMC0|4.0|There's definitely some moments of pure brilliance mixed into this CD. A few of the songs tend to blend together and it feels as though the first half is by far stronger than the last, but overall a very satisfying listen.    Iced Earth continues to bridge the gap between 80's and 00's metal better than anyone else.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|I am really confused what happened here...  When I heard Crawl and Sex on Fire on Sirius, I expected another sweet KOL album.  But I feel really let down unfortunately and I think it's a result of two songs on this album that I absolutely DESPISE:  Be Somebody and Use Somebody.  The songs have so much promise before diving into the poppiest/most shallow choruses that these guys have ever put out...  I guess I like being challenged when I listen to music (like the song \\"Milk\\") and these two songs are so mainstream it's pathetic.  On the flipside of those songs, I think Closer, Manhattan, Notion, I want you, and Cold Desert are all great, even though they completely get away from how the band started out... I'm still seeing them in concert in November, and I'm sure it will be great, but I'm still dissappointed.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|Here's my scorecard for Epica:    The Phantom Agony - Brilliant music, bad growling  Consign to Oblivion - Very good music, very little growling  Divine Conspiricy - Brilliant music, bad growling    I'm honestly not sure which formula I like better. The brilliant music is hard to pass up, but if they could just keep it and lose the growling I'd be in heaven.
0307346617|4.0|I've read that zombie fiction has been on the rise since 9/11 as it plays on our renewed \\"end of the world\\" fears.  World War Z succeeds by playing off of those fears but also from our memories and new fears of our nation's crumbling infrastructure.     I just finished this book in September '08. As I made my way through the \\"accounts\\" of survivors of the zombie plague it was impossible to not have images from Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath passing through my mind.  The truly unsettling and lingering terror of Brooks' interview -style tale is how easily and realistically he paints the fabric of our society coming undone.    Governments here and abroad fail to see the situation (the zombie epidemic) for what it is.  Some hide it and some hide. And all slowly collapse in some form while citizens try to survive.     Taking away our electricity, our power, our roads, or our access to food is a lot easier than many used to believe. Cities can fall to their knees in a couple of days while those in power do nothing rather than do the wrong thing. Hurricane Ike was a small reminder.  The current financial \\"crisis\\" has a nation holding its breath waiting to see if we'll be eating each other alive to survive.    It's not thoughts of the undead that haunt you while you try to sleep while reading World War Z but the musings on the fragility of our modern world.
B000URDEB0|4.0|While not nearly as strong an effort as Once, Dark Passion Play is still a brilliant CD in it's own right. Marco's has a much stronger presence here as a singer and sounds strong all the way through. The white elephant in the room is obviously the new singer, who holds her own quite nicely. I thought a few of the songs were weak, but I don't point the finger at Annette for that one.
0143035711|5.0|I have read this book 3 times. After the first I had it stolen so bought it again. I am fascinated by the history of Vietnam and it's struggles it has much to teach us for the present. I'm not a helicopter pilot, never will be although I too like Mason wanted to fly. Some will have differing recollections of events particularly this one, but that's okay. I was able to lose myself in the story that is expertly told. Having been in close quarter combat I understood where he was coming from. I continue to study and have read some good accounts but this will always remain one of my favourites.
B0001FGBL6|4.0|I realize this is Mark Jansen's band and he can do with it what he wants, but I would highly recommend losing the cookie monster growls. I've actually gotten used to them now after about 30 listens. The first few times through they either made me wince or smile.    Other than that, this is one of the finest CD's I've heard in quite some time.
B001C0U5DY|3.0|I had high hopes for this album but I can't give it a 5 or a 4.  To be truthful, if you see all the tracks on this release and you compare it to their last release, it's that entire album -1 song.  With 5 previous releases they use their last one far too heavily.  In fact, I think the best song on this is Our Solemn Hour but when you compare the two versions they're almost exactly the same!  To me it seems that the orchestral portion is just overpowered not overpowering.  If you like the tracks on it then download them separately but unless you are a die-hard WT fan this release you can do without.  For the record, I did like Ice Queen, but that was the song that got me listening to WT in the first place...
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I don't give 5 stars to just any product, but none are more deserving than Once. This could very well be the most brilliant and powerful CD I've heard in ages...perhaps the best since Master Of Puppets...it's really that good.    Being a busy American, I've had absolutely no exposure to the Symphonic, Operatic type metal so popular in Europe. Not only has this album hooked me on Nightwish, but has drawn me into a number of other bands such as Within Temptation, Epica, Krypteria, Therion, Sirenia, and Tristania.
B000JLSM00|5.0|This is one of the best looking blu-rays of a classic film. The Vistavision image is outstanding. The actors are at the top of their game, particularly John Wayne and Ward Bond. If you care about this film or the work of any of the participants you will be on cloud nine when you spin this one up.
B000MTFFZY|4.0|For any symphonic metal fans, Delain delivers the goods. Along with Krypteria, Delain is just a half-step behind the likes of Within Temptation, Epica, and Nightwish in my opinion. I expect more great things to come.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny Cash will forever be a true legend in the country music/southern rock industry. He is a man who set the standard to pave the way for future country/southern rock singers such as Lynard Skynard, .38 Special, Hank Williams Jr., Dwight Yoakam, and a few others. For this last installment in his long and well deserved career he has had, Johnny along with Rick Rubin produces this somewhat greatest hits cd comprised of Johnny Cash's best and most remembered songs in his career. This is the last cd Johnny Cash came out with before his passing.     With a total of 21 songs and special appereances by his wife June Carter Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, & U2, this cd has Johnny Cash's best recorded songs he has came out with all the way up to his 2003 hit \\"Hurt\\" which was produced by Rick Rubin. My personal favs on this disc are Cry Cry Cry(#1), Folsom Prison Blues(#3), I Walk the Line(#4), A Boy Named Sue(#10, Live), & Hurt(#21). They all are phenomenal songs and they all sound fantastic.     If you're a true fan of country music or yall are interested in the history of country music than this cd is one I recommend. An awesome cd to pick up.
B000065B2A|4.0|Received the video quickly.  Although it was shrink-wrapped and listed as new, it has major tracking problems from the beginning of the tape into the first minute or two of the movie.  BUT . . . the rest of it is great and I am so glad to be able to find a copy of it!  I wish I could get it on DVD!  Thanks much.
184195392X|5.0|Wow, where did Yann Martel come from? This author has an extraordinary ability to use the English language to convey thought, emotion, and physical experiences in such a profound way. He turns words into music. The story is both gentle and shattering, both tragic and ecstatic, both carnal and spiritual. I felt as though I was having a firsthand experience right alongside the protagonist, Pi Patel, whose involuntary adventure is both uniquely original and subliminally familiar. I will remember this book fondly for many years to come.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Like all good movies, this one is worth viewing multiple times.  Each time I watch it I find new things I hadn't fully appreciated before.  The Edge is not just about physical survival, but also about the search for meaning in one's life.  The characters in the story struggle to stay alive in the wilderness on their quest back to civilization as they confront the question of what it is they are living for.
B0013FNC38|5.0|\\"I'm Yours\\" is the song that inspired me to buy this CD because I love it, but \\"Butterfly\\" is the song I listen to over and over and over again.  \\"Details in the Fabric\\" with James Morrison is lyrical and the two of them singing together is beautiful.  I also love \\"Coyotes\\" and \\"The Dynamo of Volition\\".  Jason has a choir sing in one song, a chorus in another and children in another which all are awesome!  Actually, the whole CD -- the lyrics, the music, the singing, the special touches -- EXCELLENT!!!
0375826726|5.0|I was a little concerned after watching C. Paolini do his video reading of the book that it would be cheesy and a bit infantile, however, once i got into the story i was pleasantly surprised!    I liked the first books, despite all the negative reviews people gave them (especially for Eldest), and i've found the preliminary reviews of Brisingr much lower than i had guessed they would be! This book is 100% the best of the bunch! Its written much more professionally, its characters show greater depth and interest, and the interactions between them are much more clever and \\"human\\" (or realistic). Clearly, Paolini is growing as a writer and storyteller, and thats wonderful for the Inheritance cycle! I read this book during every spare second i've had the past three days and now that i've finished i feel legitimately sad! I can't wait for the 4th and final book to come out!!    Lastly, to respond to the general negative comments i quickly perused in the other reviews:    Its definitely a long book, but i never found myself wishing certain sections would be over.. this was the most shocking comment that i read. I've yet to read a 700+ page book where every single second was gripping and awe inspiring and i guess i dont understand why that type of perfection is expected.. here or otherwise. Some of the larger plotpoints, like Urgals, Humans, Dwarves, and Elves all working together, necessitated seeing the softer side of Urgals - and people are upset about ONE SCENE displaying this?? As readers we're supposed to begin feeling for these Urgals, and to become drawn into the turmoil of the difficulties in maintaining a multi-raced army. It's pretty clear that if the army was peachy and peaceful off-the-battlefield some people would complain that the book lacks realism, yet when Paolini takes the necessary steps to develop this realism-enhancing sub-plot people complain as well. Its unfortunate for Paolini that this book only has a 3 star rating so far, because its so much better than that. I'll gladly admit that the book isn't 5 star, its probably a 4 or 4.5, but i gave it 5 simply to counter the ridiculous 1 and 2 star ratings for this book.     I would completely ignore the 1 and 2 star ratings.. dont even bother to read their over-the-top reviews. You could fill a super wal-mart with all the books that are MUCH worse than Brisingr, so lets be realistic. The writing is good, the characters are developed, the story progresses, and it will literally keep you up all night long.    Lets not forget that each one of these reviewers apparently liked the book enough to not only finish it, but to finish it in 2 or 3 days... do you really continue reading 748 pages of a 1 or 2 star book? please. my shelf is littered with books with a rabbit ear on page 50, never to be opened again... if you get through a 750 page book in 3 days doesn't that pretty much require a baseline star rating of at least 3???? come on now!
B001DDBCUU|4.0|I have really mixed feelings about the show. I have seen every episode, but I didn't really enjoy a lot of it (however, I watched it with my roommates as a bonding thing, since they always complained I was by myself...reading a book). I thought there was way too much focus on trivialities and that the women were rather flighty. Towards the middle and end of the show, I felt like there was a good amount of character growth, which is why I kept watching.    That being said, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie. The movie takes place about three years since the end of the show, and there is a nice refresher on where all 4 of the women were at, in case you've forgotten. Of course, there were more than a few humorous references to sex, but the movie was much more about friendship and love than anything else, which I really enjoyed. I felt like it was more grown up than the show (ironic, I know coming from someone my age) and I feel like Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte had settled a bit into their lives. I don't know if you will enjoy this movie if you aren't at least a little bit familiar with the characters in the series, but if you have watched the show and been turned off in the past, you may enjoy the movie a bit more.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I was so excited about this album on the day of release all I wanted to do that day was get myself a copy.    The album started out really nicely with the rock vibe of \\"La La Land\\". It's a very fun song. I'm a huge fan of Demi's vocals and the rhythms.    Demi has said she asked the Jonas brothers for help on writing lyrics because her songs are too \\"dark\\". I have to disagree, but the only song only Demi wrote herself on the album is \\"Trainwreck\\" which has really nice lyrics. It reminds me very much of her demos (\\"Trash\\" \\"Open\\" \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Shadow\\"). It's nice to hear a song like this one. It actually makes me think of the past and other songs' rhythms.    \\"Party\\" is my disappointment. I first gave it two stars, but then I listened to it as I was listening to the album on my media player and I decided to give it three stars. It's kind of a very southern type of song with pointless lyrics. The lyrics are what made me upset. The end of the song says,\\"Let's do that again!\\" I say,\\"No thank you.\\"    \\"On the Line\\" is very beautiful. I'd like it better though if Nicholas Jonas hadn't taken a part in singing the second verse with Demi. His vocals are nice for his own music, but he made the song not so special. Other than that, this is a great song.    \\"Did you forget?....that I was even alive\\" my favorite song from all 11 tracks has to be \\"Don't Forget\\". When I first read the lyrics I felt like crying. I like how Demi let out her feelings and made this song very emotional. A tip before first listening to this track: rad the lyrics first, the complete lyrics.    \\"Gonna Get Caught\\". The title makes you think, and then you listen to it and realize it's a much better song than it seemed. Once again, a wondrous rhythm.    A song dedicated to her best friend, very caring of her. \\"Two World's Collide\\" reminds me of Disney songs. It could be one of those music videos with footage of the musician and of a Disney movie. Nice song, but my favorite part is the short \\"but you've given me strength to find hope\\" you may have heard on 'Get in Tune with Demi lovato' on Disney Channel.    The two songs Demi didn't take a part in writing. \\"The Middle\\" reminds me of a Hilary Diff song. \\"I like it!\\" It's one of the songs closer to Rock than Pop. \\"Until You're Mine\\". Ah! I love this one! It reminds me of my past, which is the best compliment I can ever give something.    A last, the final song, \\"Believe In Me\\". It talks about being yourself, like \\"La La Land\\", but in a different way. The story gets positive at the end as it begins talking of how \\"I'm losing myself\\". This song makes me feel at ease. It truly is \\"amazing what you can hide just by putting on a smile\\".    \\"Everyone's perfect in unusual ways.\\"
0446615641|5.0|3rd in the trilogy- A dynamic political/ suspense thriller/murder mystery. Couldn't put it down. Perfect score. A great conclusion to the Camel Club.
0143038419|5.0|A wonderfully written entertaining ,insightful and frank exploration of one person's exciting and stressful, but ultimately joyful life.  Her descriptions of places, persons and emotions bring the reader into her world and we are all the richer for it.  It's great reading for everyone but especially women..there is something in there that  absolutely everyone can identify with.  It made me decide to reread it once a year just to put life in perspective again.  You'll laugh out loud and cry and enjoy every moment.
0767903862|3.0|Reviewing a book that has been in print for eight or so years has an almost Rip Van Winkle feel to it. Like I just woke up and discovered I had missed something while asleep. However, I have to admit that picking up this Bryson \\"travel narrative\\" much later than the reviewers before me, and having read many of the positive reviews posted, I am sorry to say my tardy review won't be among them. This book just isn't in the same category as NEITHER HERE NOR THERE, NOTES FROM A SMALL ISLAND, or even his tale of a trek along part of the Appalachian Trail in A WALK IN THE WOODS. The humor is just not there. It's as though Bryson was compelled to write 300 plus pages of something about Australia by his publisher and went to the library to find interesting bits and pieces among the stacks to pad it with. There is a lot of historical, geological, zoological, and botanical information contained within. In fact, the bibliography at the back of the book has three pages of very tiny print. While interesting and informative, especially to anyone who is going to Australia for the first time or has just returned from there and wants to relive the experience, there's little for the armchair traveler to really enjoy. The author doesn't interact with many locals, unlike his previous books, and goes off on a tangent about \\"the invisible people\\" (aka the Aborigines). It's a social commentary about the sad plight of these people when their culture clashes with white Australia. He interviews a few white people in the outback about their view of \\"Abos,\\" (which is generally one of indifference) but doesn't talk to an Aborigine about his/her view of life alongside whatever whites he/she has had contact with. That aside, I have to say that I still like the way Bryson writes, when he's not lecturing me about flora and fauna or offering his liberal social opinions and sticks to well-written humorous slices of life. Sorry, Bill, I just can't recommend this book.
B00000IQW3|5.0|I'm glad to have grown up with this great fantasy movie.  I loved the story that you could actually be called up into the reality that the game is just hinting at.  This even has a liking to Ender's Game in that regard.  A fun video.
0375826726|1.0|Somebody needs to tell Christopher Paolini that no matter how many elves and dwarves you include, moral debates and politics do not an epic fantasy make.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's only one of the problems with Paolini's third long-winded, short-plotted fantasy novel about the adventures of the More-Special-Than-Thou hero Eragon. \\"Brisingr\\" reads less like a coherent novel than like a string of unevenly-written side plots -- and the last one improves somewhat, it cannot save the third Inheritance Cycle book from being as lifeless as the dead trees it's printed on.<br /><br />After a gratuitously gory cult scene, Roran and Eragon make the journey to a mountain citadel to rescue Katrina.  But after sending his cousin and future in-law off, Eragon finds himself facing a moral dilemma -- he's found Katrina's treacherous father, and isn't sure how to punish him. Be assured that whatever choice he makes is the right one, because he's a Dragon Rider and therefore Utterly Awesome. Meanwhile, the Varden are threatened when a chief of Nasuada's native people challenge her to a bloody duel, and she has no choice but to accept.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Murtagh and his newborn dragon arrive with a bunch of nerveless warriors for a surgical strike on the Varden citadel. But even after that, there are many other problems -- a forthcoming wedding, Roran's assignments on dangerous missions, and the upcoming nomination of a new dwarf king. And when Eragon finally returns to Ellesmera, he learns new facts about his own past, and is given a possible key to his future...<br /><br />Originally the finale of the series, \\"Brisingr\\" commits a lot of literary sins, but the worst is the main plot -- it doesn't have one. Instead it has a string of side plots loosely knotted together, with no central storyline to hold them in place. A battle with Murtagh, sentencing Sloan, the Trial of the Long Knives, creepy psycho-kid Elva, the sexy furry elf, the dwarf politicking -- all of these are strung on one after the other, with little to connect them.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"Brisingr\\" is boring. The entire book sags painfully under pretentious moral pondering and endless political bickering, to the point where characters will even stop during a battle to chitchat with Eragon for what seems like hours. Even Paolini seems to be aware that it's pretty bloody dull, because then he'll throw in a brief battle. But despite those battles, the biggest source of tension is everybody worrying that Eragon might get hurt, because they Just Can't Win The War without his awesomeness.<br /><br />The plot does take a slight upturn when Eragon returns to Ellesmera, and has to deal with a couple climactic plot twists straight out of \\"Star Wars.\\" But it's not nearly enough to salvage the book. And the worst part of all is that Paolini tries to be funny -- while there are a few cute moments such as Saphira sneezing fire, most of his humor is staggeringly unfunny. Examples: Nasuada's much-lauded and nonexistent wit, and Angela's talk about Monty Python bunnies. I wish I were making that up.<br /><br />And in his efforts to out-Tolkien Tolkien, Paolini's purple prose has become almost a parody of itself -- he's so intent on details that Eragon stops during a heated battle to note the color of a Lethrblaka's blood and compare it to copper verdigris. His choppy, awkward dialogue doesn't sound like anything a person would actually say or think, especially not a teenage boy (\\"Even we, who were boys but a short while ago, cannot escape the inexorable progress of time. So the generations pass...\\").<br /><br />And while Alagaesia apparently revolves around Eragon, Paolini does his self-insert no favors. There are feeble attempts at character development by making Eragon whine and angst about killing people, but it doesn't stop him from coldly killing anybody he fights, including a young man begging for mercy. And the open worship of him becomes downright nauseating: children frolic before Eragon, leaders don't dare to punish him, and injured soldiers announce \\"We fought for you, Shadeslayer!\\"<br /><br />The other characters basically are there to infodump Eragon every few pages, on everything from sharpening swords to dragons' internal organs. The only halfway interesting characters are the angry Murtagh and his dragon, and Oromis for what few scenes he has.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Like many others who have truly enjoyed this album, I am an old time fan of this awesome band.  For me, it all started with Ride the Lightning in 84, followed by what I still consider my favorite album, Master of Puppets.  Metallica, along with Iron Maiden, defined my life as a heavy metal drummer during my teenage years.  Their style was unparalleled.  Now, I am close to 40, a father of four, clean cut, but by God, this new album brings me back to my heavy metal days, and all the fun I had listening to Metallica with my buddies.    Those of you who have given this album one or two stars truly don't know Metallica.  Perhaps for you, the Metallica you know is the one who came out with Load, or ReLoad, and started getting huge on the radio.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I pretty much stopped listening to them then.  I never criticized the band though, because I understood that at some point, they had to mature, get out of that long hair, crazy head banging groove, and let their music and style mature with them.  But, in truth, I missed the old Metallica.    With this release, I am floored.  What amazes me the most, is that they have brought back all those mad guitar riffs from the past, while keeping their music mature.  And of course, as a drummer, I am still amazed at how Lars can play.    All in all, this album is fantastic, and those of you who, like me, have loved Metallica from the start, you will not be disappointed.  For those of you who think that \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is the pinnacle of  Metallica's music, well, I suggest plugging in your head sets and listening to \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", or \\"Battery\\", and maybe, just maybe, you'll undertand this new album a bit better!!  Enjoy!
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />There's also loads of extras in this particular edition of the movie -- feature commentary with director Guillermo Del Toro, Jeffrey Tambor, Selma Blair and Luke Goss, as well as some deleted scenes also with commentary with Del Toro, a prologue to the movie, a digital script, image gallery, a \\"Puppet Theatre\\" for the opening sequences of the film, concept art, interviews, and other such stuff. Also making-of documentaries -- seven mini-documentaries that visit the set, the \\"Troll Market Tour\\" in the movie's most memorable \\"faerie\\" setting, and the two-hour \\"Hellboy: In Service Of The Demon.\\"<br /><br />As if that wasn't dizzying enough, the blu-ray edition has a bunch of EXTRA extra stuff, namely a bunch of interactive features -- backstories of the characters, a create-your-own-Hellboy-comic thingy, Director's Notebook, footage from the movie \\"Wanted,\\" CGI rendering backstory, and loads more. I get tired just thinking about it.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

B0015FWRHS|5.0|Like another reviewer here, I too first heard a song from Avishai Cohen a few months back on a local jazz radio show.  The song drew me in like few others, and I needed to sit in my idle car in a dark driveway until the announcer came back on and told me who was making the beautiful music.  [I jotted down something like \\"Abishie Coen\\"!]  Then a friend with eclectic musical tastes turned me on to a couple of his titles.  \\"Gently Disturbed\\" is now the 5th Avishai Cohen album that I've purchased this past summer, and it is (imho) his masterpiece (so far).  Beautiful piano playing, interesting drumming that tackles all of the changing time signatures, and Cohen's unique bass playing  -  it all makes for a one-of-a-kind listening experience that never falters.<br /><br />I love his earlier cd's that feature a fuller band sound too, reminiscent at times of Weather Report and the like.  But this great new talent in the world of jazz really hits the cover off the ball with his latest effort here.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 9.3/10; Performance = 9.5/10; Production = 9.1; CD length = 8/10<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.3 (\\"5 stars\\")
0307269752|4.0|\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" sounds more like a kung-fu movie than a Swedish  thriller.<br /><br />But a Swedish thriller it is. And while posthumous debuts rarely get the attention they deserve -- or any attention, really -- the first novel of the late Stieg Larsson's bestselling Millennium trilogy starts slow, and slowly winds itself up into a tight knot of unique mystery and thriller elements. Just give it a few chapters to unfold.<br /><br />Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from an executive named Wennerstr&ouml;m. Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger, to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece. She vanished forty years ago from the family's isolated island, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found.<br /><br />It's a pretty cold case, and not a very inviting one. But when Vanger offers Mikael rewards he cannot refuse -- evidence on the villainous Wennerstr&ouml;m -- he finds himself facing the bizarre, sinister Vanger family with few leads to go on. Then he meets Lisbeth Salander, an eccentric, abused computer hacker who serves as his counterpoint. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried.<br />Posthumous debuts are a rarity -- publishers always want a series, sequels, publicity signings, and books headed by \\"By the Author Of...\\" You don't get any of that if the person is dead. So it's a sign of how amazing \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is that Larsson's uniquely mystery-thriller is receiving such attention across the world.<br /><br />And Larsson's book is a unique blend of old and new -- he takes the Agatha Christie aesthetic of a locked-room murder with a dozen suspects, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"<br /><br />And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story. It's the kind that feels the need to express itself even though it takes place in fiction. The only problem with the book is that Larsson pays undue attention to the whole Mikael-against-the-exec story. Not interesting, compared to the mystery.<br /><br />But Mikael and Salander make an intriguing odd couple -- he's so world-weary and demoralized that he seems to care about nothing, while Salander is a mass of hurts and quirks -- while she sometimes seems cartoonish, she's also a vibrant little character with enough strength and power to lash back at attackers. The supporting characters are far darker fare, including a loopy Nazi weirdo.<br /><br />Take the works of Agatha Christie and smother them in a disillusioned, morally-bankrupt noir world -- and you'll have something like \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\" A hard read, but leaves you wondering what the next two books have in store.hether it's the missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"    And though his prose is rather bleak and often quite gritty, a certain brand of understated passion shines through Larsson's thriller story.

B00003CXB4|4.0|\\"The Lion King\\" is one of the best movies ever made. It should be cherished as a Disney classic forever. Mufasa is so wise and Jeremy Irons does a really great job of making Scar evil. I would have to say my favorite character is Simba...because he really had some struggles and he pulled through them. This has some really great lines:  Ah yes the past can hurt, but the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it. ~Rafiki  How can I go back! I'm not who I used to be! ~Simba  You are more then what you have become ~Mufasa  Remember who you are ~Mufasa  There are countless others, but I haven't the time to name them. This movie is really wonderful. The cast is superb and the comedy is really great. It is probably the greatest animated film of all time. Not to mention that the music in this movie is absolutely PHENOMENOL, especially in the scene at the end where Simba climbs Pride Rock. Whoever designed this music has some real talent. I love this movie, it is marvelous.

The size of the letters is perfect. Large enough to be seen, but small enough to not be fragile due to size.<br /><br />I love this book. I work in a school and see children's books every day. I have never seen anything remotely like this. I will be taking this for our librarian to have a look at, as it might be a good addition. We serve special needs children ages 3-21, and I am certain that this book will be a hit.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Obviously this isn't a review of the movies themselves, but the restoration and transfer to Blu-ray. Since The Godfather Parts I and II are two of the greatest movies of all-time, and also my two favorite movies of all time, I couldn't wait for this to be released. I'm sad to say it leaves me slightly disappointed. There was no \\"wow factor\\". It does not look a whole lot better than the original DVD collection. The main difference in Part I is, the restored version has a much brighter tone to it. Part II has more vibrant color. Part III looks almost the same as the original DVD. If these were DVD's, I'd say they were excellent. But for Blu-ray, they just aren't much better than an up-converted DVD. If I were going to show off my home theater system, these definitely wouldn't be the disks to use.<br />With all that being said, being a Godfather fanatic, it was still worth it to me. If you're a fanatic too, then you still have to buy it.
B000IOM1YQ|5.0|Even for the ardent fan of The Project, the virtues of Stereotomy may not be as readily accessible as their earlier releases.  While the preceeding two albums had a somewhat softer feel as well as the gentleness of Eric Woolfson's lead vocals throughout, Alan took the ninth project in a distinctly differenent direction.  Lee Abrams, a prominent spoken word contributor to their previous album Vulture Culture, complained of the direction their recent work had taken by exclaiming, \\"Where's The Walrus?\\"  Thus was born the title to one of the finest group efforts The Project has ever performed, one that earned them yet another Grammy nomination.<br /><br />For those fans who took a liking to the softer approach with Eric Woolfson's lead vocals, Stereotomy may have been a bit of a shock.  While [[ASIN:B0017T0DW8 Stereotomy]], [[ASIN:B0017SV1FC In The Real World]], and [[ASIN:B0017SYPGO Where's The Walrus? (Instrumental)]] all had a harder edge, each also deserves a close listening, especially the former and the latter which are laden with ornate and ambient depth.  Not to mention it was here that John Miles made his triumphant return to The Project after last appearing six years prior on PYRAMID.  However, it should also be noted that the softer side of The Project was alive and well in songs like [[ASIN:B0017SYPA0 Light Of The World]], [[ASIN:B0017SSWVI Chinese Whispers]], and the astounding [[ASIN:B0017SWTPS Limelight]] featuring the earthy vocals of Procol Harem's Gary Brooker.<br /><br />This new remaster has a warmth that, while present on the original vinyl, was quite lacking on the original compact disc released by Arista.  Of the bonus material, the two standout tracks are the pre-vocal versions of [[ASIN:B0017SYPG4 Light Of The World (Instrumental)]] and the newly discovered [[ASIN:B0017SV166 Rumour Goin' Round (Demo)]] which was dropped from the original song cycle of the album.<br /><br />My personal view parallels those of both Alan and Lee Abrams: this departure from the softer approach of [[ASIN:B000NJVWUA Ammonia Avenue]] and [[ASIN:B000JLQSWE Vulture Culture]], while good albums in their own right, was well overdue.  As much as I hate to admit it, The Project had become a little too conventional by the mid-eighties.

B000000WCV|1.0|I've been wasting a lot of money recently purchasing albums that I wouldn't normally listen to,but that have been rated five stars in various music review books that I own and,for the most part,while I don't think that any of my recent purchases merits five stars,I know that this one definitely doesn't.It easily qualifies as the worst trash that I've ever heard and,believe me,I listen to and enjoy a lot of different kinds of music from the 1930s to today.This is certanly not music;all it is is out and out noise.The critics actually prefer this to Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\"(which,admittedly,I haven't heard either,but it can't be much worse)?As the title of my review states,this CD is bad for your stereo(the constant,loud bass beats could very well damage your speakers and it's a wonder that my stereo didn't just spit this CD out)as well as your health(if you're brave enough to listen to it all the way through,you'll most likely end up with a massive headache;I dare anyone to listen to the whole thing with headphones on).One of the books that I have that rates this album as a \\"must-own\\" is titled,\\"1,001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\\",but,seriously,I wanted to die after listening to this damn thing.I was completely sober when I listened (as I always am),and I don't know what kind of drugs you have to be on to enjoy this \\"music\\",but I just didn't get it.I tried,I really did,to listen with an open mind hoping that it would eventually get better,but it just never did.The CD that I listened to right after this was Daft Punk's second release,titled,\\"Discovery\\" and I could not believe the improvement.It was almost as if it was recorded by an entirely different group.Don't get me wrong;there's still plenty of annoying,repetitive crap to be heard on \\"Discovery\\" as well,just not a whole album's worth.One of the most significant differences was that \\"Discovery\\" contained clear,audible vocals whereas \\"Homework\\" did not.Please take my advice and stay far,far away fromthis release and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.

0375826726|5.0|Brisingr seems to follow the high standards of writing I have come to expect Christopher Paolini. However, I thought both Eragon and Eldest flowed more smoothly in terms of storyline.  I was also disappointed only slightly that Brisingr doesn't pick up exactly where Eldest left off, it skips just a small bit of time.  However, being able to learn how the main characters such as Saphira see the world, makes up for it.<br />Definately a good read for those whom have read both Eragon and Eldest, but if you haven't I recommend buying those first.
0156012197|5.0|Reporter of little prince<br /><br /> I was reading a book which is named little prince. It is a French writer's writing.<br />The story of little prince is a fairy tale. The whole content is very interesting. The relater was a pilot, and he had an accident with his plane in the desert of sahara in six years ago. In that time, he met a little prince. He knew the little prince was from another celestial body though by talking to him. Then the little prince related to him everything about the celestial body where he came from, especial his rose. The writer retails the everything in another six celestial bodies besides the earth where the little prince had been gone. At last , the little prince gone. The writer was very sad, as a result he wrote a book to commemorate him.<br />On his all-alone journey, the little prince met different kinds of people, which includes a king, a conceited man, a tippler, a businessman, a lamplighter and a geographer. From these people he got a conclusion that the grown-ups are very odd. Following the first character, he went to the Sahara, on the earth.<br />  Traveling on the earth, the little prince, who saw a garden of five-thousand roses, was overcome with astonishment and sadness, as he considered his rose was unique in the universe before. At that time a fox appeared. The fox, who told the little prince about the meaning of the word \\"tame\\", becomes his new friend. At the time to said farewell, the fox made him know that his rose was unique because she was his rose and tamed by him. From that the little prince began to treasure friendship and be responsible to his rose.<br />The little prince was a guy who was artless and always curious. He did everything seriously. But he also was alone; enjoy watching the sundown on the chair. He even was sad, he loved a rose deeply.<br />Maybe it's more significant for us to imagine, and for more, think over.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Ronald Emmerich makes the kind of movies it would be better if we had a lot less of. INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW....Robert Emmerich = dumb, big, loud, silly entertainment for the masses during summer time. I wish Hollywood would get a little more ballsy and start moving away from their tired mega-budget summer blockbuster strategy and invest just a little more capital in different projects. They would learn there is money in making better movies. ANYWAY, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is absurd and unless Americans are as dumb as apparently talk radio hosts seem to think their listeners are, this film does not work very well as propaganda for environmentalists. Actually to the extent environmental activists are linked to wacky movies like this they are regarded as extremists and crazy by much of the public. Well that's my take. Right-wing radio would go outta business if they didn't have Hollywood to demonize and whine about all day long like victimized babies. Anyway, \\"liberal\\" Hollywood is mostly about money, not ideas --whether the ideas be artistic, scientific, or even political and that's clear enough with THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. But I digress: THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW sucks because it takes itself too seriously. If it were somehow done with a wink and a nod we could be in on the joke but it's not. An absurd disaster popcorn flick might could work well if it recognized it's own utter preposterousness. This one is done as they all too often are with the pretense that this scenerio could realistically happen in the real world but obviously that's nonsense and we're supposed to what? Suspend disbelief? But I don't want to. We're not supposed to laugh at it and not supposed to take it too seriously, obviously. We are to enjoy the \\"eye candy\\" and dim plot and dialogue but I'm not going to just enjoy CGI storms and buildings falling apart because I've seen it before and I sure have experienced enough mediocre story telling in my day.<br /><br />\\"Emmerich obviously doesn't care if the science is flimsy, so why should you? --Jeff Shannon\\"<br /><br />Gee, I don't know really. \\"It's just a movie\\" and so whatever.sly doesn't care if the science is flimsy, so why should you? --Jeff Shannon\\"    Gee, I don't know really. \\"It's just a movie\\" and so whatever.

Mikael and Lisbeth, main characters, make a great team which is one of the strengths of the book.<br /><br />As a mystery lover, I tend to like more descriptive writing than you get with this book. Also, you are buried in inane details and much repetition. That detracts from the book and thus the three star rating.

If you find yourself getting bored because a lack of action or confused and disconnected because of the flashbacks then this movie is clearly above your intelectual level. It is almost like the movie isn't designed to entertain. Instead, it is more of a hommage to the thousands of veterans who were wounded or killed. This is an absolute masterpiece for anyone who is interested in WWII history. This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Thank you Clint Eastwood.
0142004413|5.0|I have never written a book review, and I am hesitant to do so now as whatever I say will certainly be redundant.  But I am so enthralled with this little book that I can't contain my enthusiasm.    This is a quick read, but that is not to indicate any superficiality in the story or story telling.  The author reveals a world of discovery in his life on Corfu.  Far from dull, his time there is filled with small adventures and big lessons.  There is nothing the least preachy or even \\"teachy\\" in the story line, but the learning for the reader takes place in such a pleasant fashion that you don't realize until the end how much knowledge you have gained.    His eccentric family provides light and very humorous moments, but, for the most part, I found them and the stories about them quite unnecessary.     The author's curiosity about the animals, amphibians, birds and world around him drive the story.  His observations of human kind, especially the island people he meets, are equally compelling.    I could not put this book down and, as it was lent to me, I am now on a quest to purchase my own copy.    It only makes me wonder why children in modern day society need the enormous amount of stimulus and involvement to be content.  Young Gerald Durrell spent much of his time alone, save the companionship of his \\"zoo\\", and was quite happy.  No soccer games, no little league baseball, no hang-outs at the mall necessary.  Oh, for the simple life.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Being a huge World War 2 fan this is a must have and it also will appeal to many other \\"non war fans\\" . About two years ago I let three different people borrow my dvd box set and all three of them loved this very much. They then went and bought it for themselves and also let their other family members watch it as well.  It's easy to get attached to the different types of characters in the series for each one is totally different. I love this series and it really makes you appreciate your freedom and the sacrifice that was done back then and even now.  Enjoyand it is well worth it and the Blu Ray price is amazingly low from my opinion.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|The danger in reviewing this is that there is the risk that it only sounds good to me because I was expecting so much less.  I didn't even know Metallica had released a new album until TODAY, that being a full two weeks after it hit the stores.  After the Napster case and St. Anger, I just wasn't paying attention anymore.  I own all the Metallica CDs up through Garage Inc. (just couldn't bring myself to buy St. Anger tick tick tick tick tick tock) and am now proud to say I own this one.  The best way I could describe it is to say it sounds like Load should have sounded.  It's heavy.  It slows down a few times, speeds up a lot more but remains heavy throughout.  There are no ballads here that will show up on \\"adult contemporary\\" radio stations (I never liked Nothing Else Matters anyway). The bass is back (drum and guitar) along with Hetfield's scratchy voice and power chords.  And by all that's holy, there are guitar solos.  Finally, we see proof that Hamster has only lost his hair, not his abilities.    All that said, it is clear that this is not the same band that gave us Ride and Master.  Thankfully they also appear to not be the same band that gave us St. Anger.  They are older, they have been through more, and they are probably less healthy and more experienced.  I'm OK with that, because I'm in the same boat since I first heard their music twenty-some years ago.
0307269752|5.0|After having read a series of mediocre \\"Mystery and Thriller\\" novels this summer (\\"Fresh Kills\\", \\"Immunity\\" \\"Good People\\" and the totally dumb \\"The Garden of Evil\\"), I finally found a really good novel!  \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has deep, well thought out characters, and many neat plot twists.  When I was about 80 pages from the end of the book, I thought the ending was going to be a big letdown, but it wasn't!  Two minor flaws: 1) The translation from Swedish is competent, but the translator is obviously not a native-level speaker of English.  2) The main character makes a very stupid decision at about 3/4 through the book -- I suspect it was just the easiest way to move the plot in the direction the author wanted it to go.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|A Great release that gets better with every listen. Finally James gets back to singing with force and anger. All Nightmare Long, That Was Just Your Life, & Broken,Beat,&Scarred are flat out Awesome!! In my opinion anyone that rates this lower than 3 stars is just a Metallica hater. 4-5 makes more sense.
B0001Z363W|5.0|I see some people are complaining that isn't a metal album.....well it says right in the title..\\"Hangover Music.\\"  When your head is throbbing from a long night of Crown & Tequilla, the last thing you're gonna want to listen to is some hard n' heavy riffs.  This is a pretty laid back album, has a southernish blues/country feel to it at times.  Something to put it when you're tryin to kick back & relax.  Pick this 1 up
0321544080|4.0|Note that the majority of people that don't like this book explicitly mention Kelby's books.  That should speak volumes to experienced photographers and photo editors.    If you love Scott Kelby books then this probably isn't the book for you.  It isn't filled with lousy jokes and simple formulas.  You have to have some base photographic knowledge to pull off complex shots and you'll never get there with simple formulas.  No ... it isn't a beginner book like Kelby's drivel so don't buy it if that's what you're into.
B000LXH0AY|2.0|The trouble with Rent is that most people see it for the surface plot, and take it as a musical about people with AIDS.  In fact, for some of the most die-hard fans, it took a few listens and years of letting the lyrics sink in to understand the message behind the story.  It's not a musical about AIDS; it's a musical about people learning to live life in the moment -- live for today -- and find happiness instead of dwelling in regret and indecision.  Any artist knows this feeling, and that's perhaps why so many fans are other struggling artists while people who are \\"mainstream\\" or professional don't find a connection with the story or its characters.    While the character relationships are inspired by the characters in La Boheme, the lyrics and the heart of this story are rooted in social issues that its creator dealt with; in struggling for his art, for his career, and while watching many of the people around him die.  Today we live in a society where having AIDS isn't so much of a death sentence with the proper care and medication... but in 1989, the first generations who had contracted it earlier and were now reaching the end of their lifespan were dealing with a much different life, involving a lot of confusion, fear, and regret.  The point is not that all of these people have AIDS; if you actually take the time to hear the words as a message and a lesson to learn, what you receive is very profound and eye-opening.  In fact, only 4 of the 8 main characters are ill.  No one complained that La Boheme, the world's most beloved opera, was about a bunch of people complaining about the plague; perhaps because it's easier to listen to people dwell on something we're not afraid of anymore.  AIDS makes people uncomfortable.    Contrary to the opinions of some viewers who feel that the costumes and sets and characters are cliche and almost caricature in nature... perhaps these people don't LIVE the life depicted in the musical.  After all, shows like Jesus Christ Superstar are just as ridiculous to me because of my religious beliefs -- or lack thereof -- and so one can't expect me to share the same appreciation for something I don't understand.  However, the people who do adore the musical will tell you that they also dressed that way and lived that way and that we are NOT caricatures to be made fun of.  I DID dress like that.  I WAS stared at by those who were conservative... but there are two kinds of audiences: those who look for entertainment value and those who appreciate the poetry and the symbolism.  After all, with the exception of Chicago, I loathe flashy, dancy musicals because I find them unrealistic and cheesy.  But that's just ME.    To say that this is clearly an amalgamation of stereotypes by a creator who didn't understand his material is utterly ridiculous if you take the time to read about Jonathan Larson and his life; especially what inspired him to write this musical in the first place.  To suggest that he was some big shot who thought it might be cute to write about this subject material without firsthand experience... well... maybe it is the reviewers who follow the stereotypes.  It is Mr. Larson who is also rolling in his grave.    What I WILL say about the Rent movie is that it stinks.  I was a Renthead who saw it every weekend during its run.  Call me crazy -- in retrospect I know it sounds lame -- but you also have to consider that some people go to church every week to reaffirm their belief system, while Rent taught me to appreciate life and where I am, regardless of the hardships.  To accept who I am and where I'm going without fear.  To trust in risk and not feel so obligated to follow the rigid, conservative structure we're pressured to comply with because of judgment and conformity.  In the end, as long as I love what I do and surround myself in people I love, happiness is with me.  That was a lesson worth every single one of those weekends... and it's clearly not what the opposition got from this musical, but it just goes to show you that there is something deeper than what's on the surface.  And that's a legitimate response.  Some people don't think they should have to get to know the show first, or spend more than one sitting in order to appreciate it.  Some people expect it to be laid out for them, to see a show and go home.  If you're expecting that, this isn't the kind of theatre you should see. It deals with many issues, from battling with your pursuit of your art versus \\"the real world\\", family obligations, love triangles, illness, inability to let people into your heart... all issues some of know quite well all our lives.  For the right person, it can be a very thought-provoking and life-changing experience with an important message.    But it was a message that did not come through when Hollywood tried to take control of the project.  Fans and newbies alike either love or hate this film, and I am thoroughly disappointed with it, despite the nostalgia of the (mostly) original cast members.  I just happened to see a new Rent movie this evening: the final Broadway performance -- filmed live on stage -- and I am finally satisfied that I have seen a proper Rent movie.  THAT is the movie I would recommend for someone wanting to experience the musical as it should be.  Even *I* found the Hollywood characters flat and hollow, but perhaps it's not a story for this kind of film, or perhaps the cut material made more of a difference than they anticipated.  Either way... there is not \\"rap\\" song.  I don't know WHAT that reviewer is talking about.  There are some weaker pieces -- which happens with musicals -- but the ones that snagged the followers are the ones with a message about acceptance, love, and living for the moment.    Ultimately, audiences either love or hate Rent, and the response is pretty predictable depending on where you came from, how creative you are, and the kind of social outlook you have.  And I don't mean social classes -- I mean just your social circle, career path, or view of city life.  This musical isn't for everyone, that's for sure.  But just because you didn't share our experiences doesn't make it bad or inaccurate; it just means you don't sympathize because it's not a story you relate to.
B000YD7F10|5.0|Basicaly a concept album about bank robbers,desperados and the wildness of youth, this album still stands tall today. starting with the melodic Doolin Daltons, this song basically say's, your not going to live long breaking the law. i like every song on this album, especialy the one's you don't hear on the radio all the time. Like the hard rocker Out of Control. the beautiful Saturday night, and one of Bernie Leadon's best songs ever, Bitter Creek. each song on this album tells a story, and these are stories you can hear again and again. don't forget the songs you do hear on the radio, Desperado - Tequila sunrise, a great album for new fans and old fans alike! Highly recomended!
B00026WU7I|5.0|I owned an LP copy of this album when it was first released.  The music quickly grew on me, and I took the wonderful sound for granted.  When I bought the first CD release of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" the sound was so thin and tinny I couldn't listen to it.  No longer owning a turntable by that time, I lived without this album for years, and missed it.     Finally, after too long a wait, we have a decent-sounding CD version of this essential Dylan album--two versions, actually, as an SACD Hybrid disc was released first, then this one.  I am guessing that this conventional CD issue followed because the record labels have come to believe there is too little interest in the SACD format.     At any rate, both of the current \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" CDs sound good.  If you do not own an SACD player, the two releases sound alike.  Packaging is different for the two versions:  the SACD is housed in a glossy paper \\"Digipak\\" made to resemble the original LP jacket design; the conventional CD is sold in a standard jewel case.     A word about the sound:  this CD release seems a bit light in the bass range compared to my memories of how the LP sounded.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Too many \\"newly remastered\\" CDs are bass-heavy to the point of damaging the overall sound.  The remastered \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" sounds balanced and the bass is present, just slightly less so than I remember.  Since everything else sounds right to me, I am not complaining.  I should add that I was unable even ONCE to listen all the way through the earliest \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" CD.  I have played this remastered disc over and over, and have never tired of hearing it.     I have no idea whether or not the SACD Hybrid release of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" will continue to be available, but both versions sound very alike on a standard CD player and this conventional disc is less expensive, so I would give it a high recommendation.  If you were unfortunate enough to have owned the earliest CD release ofthis music, buy this one to cleanse your palate and rediscover one of Bob Dylan's truly fine albums.

0307386171|5.0|On Chesil Beach is another short novel by the fine English novelist Ian McEwan. As he has done so often before the novelist has the ability to focus on the defnining moment in a relationship. He does this with lush prose used to tell this poignant tale of lost love, impatience and lost opportunities. This feeling of \\"what might have been if only...\\" resonates with this critic and the hoardes of eager McEwan fans who enjoy intellectually sharp tales well told by a master of the craft.<br />  Edward is 23 and his longtime fiance Florence is 22. The two are honeymooning at a hotel near Dorset in the English West Country. Both of these bright young people are sexually inexperienced virgins.  Edward comes from the home of a dysfunctional familiy. His father is an underpaid schoolmaster; his mother has mental problems; his siblings bore him. Edward gets a first in History and meets Florence in Oxford. He is smitten with her big boned beauty and interest in preventing nuclear warfare.  The two decorously begin a prim and proper romantic relationship. Some kissing and fondling occur but no sexual intercourse.<br />  Florence is an outstanding musician who graduates from the Royal Academy of Music. Her string quartet is on the way up the musical ladder. She is very prim and straight-laced. She fears intimacy with a man even though she loves him very much. Florence comes from a wealthy family but Edward has no trouble ingratiating himself with her well heeled flock.<br />  On Chesil Beach occurs on their first night together as husband and wife. They suffer through a routine meal knowing their initiation in sex awaits in the marital bed. A terrible incident occurs when Florence provokes Edward into an early orgasm. This situation leads to their ultimate estrangement. Years later Edward will look back and realize if he had only been more patient with Florence their lives would have been happier. Edward knows that he has never loved anyone as much as Florence but it is too late to revive his relationship with her. Like all of us we all have regrets as we grow older.<br />  The novel is filled with flashbacks to the pasts of Edward and Florence helping the reader to understand what motivates these two characters We also return to the more formal era of the early 1960s which McEwan introduces through the means of hotel guests commenting on the news on the hotel's televison. This era of propriety now seems so distant in our anything goes amoral society.<br />  McEwan has a few brief sex scenes but they are tastefully and sensitively presented. He has a keen eye for the beauties of nature and also is keen in his love for and appreciation for  classical music.<br />  This novel is short but one which will stick in your mind for years to come.

0780619587|5.0|That's a marvelous but cruel film. Cruel to us in its beauty. Cruel to David in his complete estrangement from the world of noise lost that he is in his world of music. How can you be deaf to anything but music? It is possible, even if that sounds crazy, if that is a mental lunacy. The film tries to get us to two conclusions. The first one is that a father can be right but only for a short while. A son has to get away from his father as soon as he can otherwise he might be destroyed, utterly destroyed. In this case he is only mentally destroyed. He loses the sense of time and even space probably. Time does not exist any more, which is not serious in itself; many people can live without time. But duration, goes away too and that is unbearable. When life does not have any duration any more it does not exist any longer and it becomes so static that it may drown you completely. David Helfgott is saved from his predicament, first by one decision: to go away from his father when he gets a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London. Then by the phenomenal teacher he gets in London that accepts his decision to play Rachmaninoff in the Albert Hall, what his father wanted him to play when he was still a child. The connection of the father and his curse, the composer and his own predicament, and his emotion that he projects into the music, the place and his father's absence, all that does it: he loses the sound of the world, though not of the music, he loses the sense of duration and he falls into a complete vacuum, a mental hospital. He will be taken out of it by a simple lady who plays the piano for the patients, and then from this to that he will find a bar where he will be able to perform day after day and build a reputation that will attract people and one woman will accept to redeem him to life and marry him into a new career in the Albert Hall again for a second triumph, this time with no escape possible from the stage and success. And that is the second lesson. When you run away from your father and you lose him in the process, you lose any and all sense of reality that can only come back to you from inside and by accepting to bring that inside world of yours out. But you need some helping hands along the way, helping hands you have to negotiate and find all by yourself. And David did it. The son of the super poor surviving Jew exiled in Australia after the war was able to reach the sky and be some kind of an angel up there in the sunrise dancing in mid air as if he were on a trampoline. This optimism is refreshing because we all know too many people who did not end up like that. For one of these victims of life that manages to get through, so many will never even be able to raise their eyes and look at the stars.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines.

B00005221M|1.0|What a disappointment!    Sadly, when the director, Michael Mann, decided to cut the Clannad song, \\"No Matter Where You Go, I'll Find You,\\" (not to mention the best one liners) from the 'Expanded' version, he ruined it.    If the visuals are the heart of the film, it is still stunning.  It looks good  in HD.  But without the ethereal, hauntingly beautiful music in the background of Hawkeye's tracking scenes, the sense of desperation and despair - the soul of the film - is simply gone.  When I first saw this film I didn't stop hunting until I found the song on a Clannad album.    If I hadn't received this as a gift, (the only thing I've actually asked for in years), I'd be demanding my money back.    I can't see myself going out and buying a multi region DVD player and the British region version, but I would buy it if Mr. Mann comes to his senses and re-releases an 'Original - Classic' version on DVD for the USA.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Ah, yes. ZZ Top made some of the best music of the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Whether they were performing blues rock songs or winning over audiences on MTV, these Texans proved that they knew how to make great rock and roll and survive for numerous generations, and amazingly, they still continue to perform and tour today with the original members.    2004's 'Rancho Texicano - The Very Best of ZZ Top,' gives ZZ Top the two disc retrospective it's long needed. If you are a casual fan that wants more than what 1992's 'Greatest Hits' or 1977's 'The Best of ZZ Top' offers, than look no further.    Unfortunately, this disc stops at 1992, which is a shame, because their RCA material from 1994-2003 is really great too. Oh well.    Well, here is the album by album, track by track review.    Tracks from ZZ Top's First Album (1971)  'Brown Sugar,' 'Goin' Back To Mexico,' 'Just Got Back From Baby's'  Review: Their 1971 debut is by far their most blues oriented. One question though, where is 'Backdoor Love Affair'? That's probably my favorite song from this album. That's a disappointing omission.    Tracks from Rio Grande Mud (1972)  'Francine,' 'Just Got Paid,' 'Bar-B-Q'  Review: The three best songs from their sophomore effort. Blues rock at it's finest. Rhino Records selected the very best from this album.    Tracks from Tres Hombres (1973)  'La Grange,' 'Waitin' For The Bus,' 'Jesus Just Left Chicago,' 'Beer Drinkers And Hell Raisers'  Review: Arguably ZZ Top's best album gets great coverage here. The four great ones and standouts from this album appear on 'Rancho Texicano.' The whole album is great, so you may want to buy that album as well.    Tracks from Fandango! (1975)  'Mexican Blackbird,' 'Tush,' 'Blue Jean Blues,' 'Heard It On The X,' 'Thunderbird'  Review: Half studio album, half live album, 'Fandango!' remains my all time favorite ZZ Top album. Their last album for London Records, they definitely went out with a bang. The five essentials from this album are here. No complaints.    Tracks from Tejas (1976)  'It's Only Love,' 'Arrested For Driving While Blind'  Review: I have always thought of 'Tejas' to be the forgotten ZZ Top album. I have no complaints about what's featured, but where the heck is 'Snappy Kakkie'? That's arguably one of their best, and it's omission is irritating.     Tracks from Deguello (1979)  'I Thank You,' 'I'm Bad I'm Nationwide,' 'Cheap Sunglasses,' 'A Fool For Your Stockings'  Review: After 'Tejas,' ZZ Top took a three year break, and returned in 1979 with 'Deguello.' This album contains two of my all time favorites from ZZ Top, 'I'm Bad I'm Nationwide' and 'Cheap Sunglasses.' This was their last album before Billy Gibbons discovered the synthesizer. Rhino selected the four great tracks from this album. ZZ Top closed the 1970s with a bang here.    Tracks from El Loco (1981)  'Tube Snake Boogie,' 'Pearl Necklace'  Review: It's amazing how much ZZ Top changed in two years. Still, change isn't always a bad thing, and in this case, it isn't. This is a pretty good album, and these are the two really good songs from 'El Loco.' Enough said!    Tracks from Eliminator (1983)  'Gimme All Your Lovin,' 'Sharp Dressed Man,' 'Legs,' 'Got Me Under Pressure'  Review: Enter the MTV years of ZZ Top. One of their most successful albums to date, 'Eliminator' spawned four major MTV hits and radio hits alike for ZZ Top. This album is a classic, and while fans of the 1970s ZZ Top were very turned off by this, it's considered a 1980s classic. These are the four great ones from this album. Wouldn't mind seeing 'Thug' here, but that's nothing to cry about.    Tracks from Afterburner (1985)  'Sleeping Bag,' 'Stages,' 'Rough Boy,' 'Velcro Fly,' 'Woke Up With Wood'  Review: Their most synth-driven album, 'Afterburner' is an interesting album. Personally, this is probably my least favorite ZZ Top album, but it's still pretty good. I guess Rhino picked the bright spots from this album. I have no say here, really.    Tracks fromRecycler (1990)  'Doubleback,' 'My Head's In Mississippi'  Review: ZZ Top's last official studio album for Warner Bros. Records. 'Recycler' was not a bright spot for the band, but they were as popular on MTV as ever, though. The return to blues rock in 'My Head's In Mississippi' was a pleasant surprise for '70s ZZ Top, and 'Doubleback' showed flashes of 'Deguello'-era ZZ Top, but still, they were very much powered by synthesizers here.    Tracks from Greatest Hits (1992)  'Viva Las Vegas'  Review: Bassist Dusty Hill takes the lead vocals job here, and he does a pretty good job covering Elvis (this is his second Elvis cover; he covered Elvis in 1975 for the live version of 'Jailhouse Rock' that appears on 'Fandango!'). This is actually one of my favorite ZZ Top recordings from the 1983-1992 period. They did a pretty good job here.    Assorted tracks  'Cheap Sunglasses (live),' 'Velcro Fly (12\\" remix),' 'Legs (Dance Remix)'  Review: The live version of 'Cheap Sunglasses' is pretty good, although the remixes I think don't need to be included here.    Overall, this is the best available overview of ZZ Top. I strongly recommend this for casual fans, new fans and die hard fans alike.    Highly recommended for any ZZ Top fan. Two CDs of pure goodness. The most comprehensive ZZ Top collection on the market, with the exception of the box sets, of course.    ENJOY!!!
B00168HARG|5.0|This show is excellent. Many of us, I'm sure, were hesitant to see an Arnold-less Terminator TV show, with a new actress filling the shoes of the iconic Sarah Connor, after being immortalized by Linda Hamilton. Well, as both a long time Terminator fan, and someone who is very picky about which TV shows they watch, I can safely say that this show delivers the goods in ways I couldn't have imagined.<br /><br />The cast for this show is excellent. The producers wisely opted not to simply cast Sarah Connor based on how well the actress resembled Hamilton, but by how well she portrayed the character. Lena Headey is friggin' close to perfect for the role, and that was something that I was not expecting at all when I first found out they were making the show. Thomas Dekker as John Connor bears a stronger resemblance to his Terminator 2 counterpart, but more importantly he fills the role very well. Given that the Connors are the only Terminator 2 veterans who appear regularly in the series, it was fundamental to the show's success that they cast them properly, and thankfully they did.<br /><br />The real show stealer though, is Summer Glau as the new character \\"Cameron.\\" She's John's new cyborg protector from the future, and it's no surprise that she is rapidly becoming a fan favorite. The role of Cameron is much more complicated than simply an emotionless robot, because she's more than a regular Terminator, as the series slowly reveals. She's a machine that is slowly becoming more human-like, and Summer Glau is the perfect actress to convey both aspects of Cameron's personality. She's definitely one of my favorite aspects of the show, and I can't wait to see how she develops in future episodes.<br /><br />The writing in the show is well done too. There are a few continuity errors in some episodes that you may or may not pick up on depending on how closely you pay attention, but those aren't really what's important. What is important is that the story actually makes you care about the characters, and eager to find out what happens next. Sometimes I would literally throw things at my TV when a commercial break started just because I was so hooked. They did an excellent job selling that these are the same John and Sarah Connor from Terminator 2, but the writers now have the opportunity to expand their characters a lot further than was possible in a 2.5 hour long movie.<br /><br />If you are a Terminator fan, you owe it to youself to buy this set. The visual quality for the Blue-Ray is amazing, and it even comes with a slightly extended cut of the pilot, and a greatly extended cut of one of the later episodes that sheds even more light on Sarah Connor's character. I am addicted to this show.and eager to find out what happens next. Sometimes I would literally throw things at my TV when a commercial break started just because I was so hooked.

The visual quality for the Blue-Ray is amazing, and it even comes with a slightly extended cut of the pilot, and a greatly extended cut of one of the later episodes that sheds even more light on Sarah Connor's character. I am addicted to this show.
0446402389|5.0|A serial killer whose MO never seems to change, preying on the children Soviet people dote on, versus one of the State Security's finest...a former sharp shooter in the Great Patriotic war, known for his athletic prowess, good judgment and brilliance.  Just the detective to solve these terrible crimes and keep the next family from the grief of losing a child.<br /><br />There is one problem:  In Stalin's Russia, there *is* no crime.  To suggest otherwise and question the perfection of the Worker's Paradise, will certainly earn the accuser a change in lifestyle...which will impede any hope he has of ever catching the killer.<br /><br />Tom Rob Smith has crafted a fast paced, smart story featuring a crime that would be unthinkable in any setting; a skillful description of a culture infused with the deep, dark colors of Dostoevsky and Moussorgsky, trapped within the confines of Stalin and his henchmen; great characters; and a double twist that will leave you dizzy but immediately searching Amazon for the next Leo Demidov book...where is it, Tom????  Don't keep us waiting too long!<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommended.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|Terminator 2 is one of the best movies ever made. It has inspired novels, comic books, games, two more sequels (one of which is in production), and a TV series (The Sarah Connor Chronicles, which is my favorite show since Firefly). Needless to say, this is a film who's greatness is never to be doubted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this Blu-Ray disc is crap. It uses the old MPEG2 video encoder, so the picture quality is not what it ought to be on this format. The special features are absolutel bare bones, which is a darned shame since Extreme Edition and Ultimate Edition were both loaded up with lots of great goodies for fans to dig into. I would have settled for just getting the content from those two releases here in standard definition, just because they were so thorough and complete. Sadly, we get none of that here.<br /><br />The worst sin that this disc commits of all though, is that it does not include the special extended version. The extended cut of T2 is the definitive version of the movie-- once you've seen it, there's really no reason to go back and watch the original theatrical version. There was a load of good stuff that got added to the extended cut, and a lot of it was very important for the story. Whoever put this crappy Blu-Ray disc together obviously made it with the intention of double dipping in the future. If you must watch T2 in high definition now, then I won't stop you from buying it. However, be warned that in a few months it's bound to become a coaster when they put out a brand new version containing the extended cut, immaculate picture quality, and loads of special features. This disc is a temporary Terminator fix, at best.
B000002NG7|4.0|Horribly under rated. But not by the amazon reviewers they only review albums they love, look around everything is 4-and-a-half-stars. I guess it balances out music reviews in general, critics usually hate everything, I guess they have fun writing that way.
0061537934|5.0|I read it.  I loved it.  I put it down.  Picked it back up and read parts(especially the last chapter) over and over.  It touched my heart in the very same way that only your very best canine friend can.  I will always love Enzo, the perfect example of why dogs are man's best friend.  This book is nothing like \\"Edgar Sawtelle\\" - don't be deceived by comparisons.  Forget Oprah's opinion -- read this!
B0012IV3RS|1.0|For the life of me (no pun intended) I have no idea why I rented so many Fulci films.  I've seen a lot of his catalog, and this one (along with Cat in the Brain) has to be the worst.  It's one of his most \\"infamous\\".<br />It's his most infamous because of a serial killer doing a Donald Duck impression and seeing a lot of women cut up in various gruesome and sick, sick ways.  The film has all the usual Fulci ingredients:  bad story, atrocious dialogue, bad dubbing (though I'm sure this would be a piece of garbage in Italian as well), crappy camera work, just all around unprofessional, tacky, and a complete waste of time.  I kick myself a lot when I decided \\"I should give this guy a chance\\", so I saw a lot of his films (too many), and I dread the name Fulci, as it is synonymous with \\"worst films ever made\\".<br /><br />I think the BBFC did the larger viewing public a disservice when they classified this as a \\"video nasty\\" (and other Fulci works), because it made many people go out and seek it out.  They should have just let it slide through and labeled it \\"mediocre, preposterously s****y, enormous toilet dropping of a movie\\".  I sometimes think that because Fulci is so reviled by many that people assume he must be a genius that \\"film snobs\\" or \\"elites\\" don't get.  This isn't true at all.  He's just a really bad filmmaker who made a couple of decent films (Zombie is his most consistent), and upped the gore quotient in the horror genre.  Just because a government body like the BBFC (British Board of Film Censors) ban stuff like this doesn't make it art, you know.<br /><br />The Fulci rant continueth on House by the Cemetery...
B0006IIPJ4|4.0|Cornball plot but cool movie nonetheless. Although Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins acts and talks like she's spaced-out (i.e. reading from a script) like she tends to do in a lot of her movies. Jude Law's (Sky Captain) voice somehow always seems to grate on me.<br /><br />The digital special effects seem to take one back to another time in film-making (yeah, I know). Though the acting was rather stiff; especially from Angelina Jolie, it was a fun adventure film. Funny also with Gwyneth Paltrow and her camera; deciding whether or not to take a shot, knowing full well she's almost out of film.<br /><br />The \\"robot monsters\\" were pretty cool. But it was kind of stupid that Sky Captain was flying a \\"prop job\\" (P-40) with some \\"futuristic hardware\\" that didn't go with the airplane.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi plays Dex, the chewing gum chomping stereotype of a mechanical wiz that's a throwback from the \\"old movies\\" - yeah, I know, that's the way it was meant to be. But he over-acted to the point of being very annoying.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|This is a good come back after the disappointing 90's albums (i.e. black album, load, reload etc).  However I still think this album is miles away from being a true classic compared to Master of puppets or Ride the lightning.   Was the magic lost with Cliff Burton departure?? So far the answer is yes.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield is more than a mediocre monster film. It is actually pretty darn good. Not great, but entertaining enough at 84 minutes to keep you interested from beginning to unconventional end, which is not something we usually see. I will not spoil anything, but this film is unlike most monster films. Besides the fact that there is a huge monster and it is attacking NYC and its people, the similarities stop there.     There is no scientific mumbo jumbo, no real type of help, per se. There is just a small group of people and a video camera. We see what they see. Nothing more. It's pretty neat, and unlike the boring Blair Witch Project, actually effective, though I can imagine some people getting physically sick while watching this.     The other thing I was surprised about was that we actually got to learn quite a bit about the few characters. You actually care what happens to them.     The effects are pretty cool and the monster itself is quite interesting, especially the way it moves. Clearly alot of thought was put into the design.    There is no musical score in the film, which actually makes it seem more believable and real.    The film does have its flaws however. First, and most probably the biggest; it is not very scary, nor terribly suspenseful until about the last 10 minutes. Almost nothing is explained nor really resolved, but then again, we are only seeing what the characters see, nothing more, so I can't really fault that.    I found it exciting and enjoyable and would love to see some kind of a sequel, which I think would benefit this film even more.     The special features on the dvd are minute but kind of cool. Green Screen stuff, commentary. The alternate endings are almost undistinguishable from the original one, and not anything special. Even the bloopers were just eh.    All in all, a pretty fun ride, nothing more, nothing less.
031606792X|3.0|I dont know but arent Vampires supposed to be Bad and Evil, after reading this book I felt that its an honor that you were given the chance to be a Vampire...    After three books Edward fighting not to turn Bella into a Vampire... and how he says its hard to be a newborn etc... and then Bella is Vampire who is living happily ever after without having any problems as a newborn... The way the author kept mentioning how she liked being a vampire and how she is better now than when she was human is frustrating... I cant believe this book...    And how the author made it so simple to just ditch your family and friends for the sake of love... What will teenagers get out of this... She simply eliminated the family bond!!! Is it that easy to get rid of your mom and dad just to be with a Vampire... Actually I didnt feel that there was love between them... All I felt is that she just adored his looks and physical features... purely sexual relation that they will spend forever enjoying...    I hope some day someone manages to kill them and saves us from their pathetic shallow life...     This was a cold sexual saga hidden under the umbrella of Science Fiction... and I am GLAD its over...
B00004Y6O7|4.0|Fair Warning was Van Halen's fourth studio album. It peaked at #5 on the album charts & it had four singles that charted! This is simply amazing because Fair Warning is probably the LEAST commercial album they released with Diamond Dave on vocals. Though there were four charting singles from the album it's not quite as obvious to the why. It should be noted that all four singles didn't crack the Pop Singles Chart (Billboard's main chart) but only entered Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. \\"Mean Street\\" peaked at #12, \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" went to #29, \\"So This Is Love? went to #15,& \\"Unchained\\" peaked at #13. Fair Warning is Van Halen's hardest rocking album & also, without a doubt their most dark & unrelenting album. There's very little party atmosphere present. Women & Children First contained a small seed of this darkness & by the time of Fair Warning it had fully blossomed. Even the album cover was a harbinger of what was inside: hard, relentless % unmerciful.    \\"Mean Street\\" is the first salvo of the album. Eddie Van Halen starts off with a sizzling guitar lick that lets you know immediately that there won't be any prisoners taken on this trip. \\"Mean Street\\" is a hard rocking song with dark & foreboding lyrics that inspired the title of the album. Diamond Dave isn't trying to be cute with his vocals, he's in the battle too, singing in a style that's menacing. \\"Dirty Movies\\" is mellower in tone & less menacing than the previous song but there's still something unusual about it; it's still unrelenting. \\"Remember when that girl was prom queen?\\" \\"Sinner's Swing!\\" revels in its naughtiness & wallows in the things better left unmentioned. \\"Hear About It Later\\" opens with Eddie playing a mellow electric guitar before the band breaks into the body of the song. \\"Hear About It Later\\" is the one song on Fair Warning that sounds like it could have come from either of the first two albums. But at about 2;40 of the song there's a change in the sound that harkens back to themain themes of Fair Warning before the band breaks back into the song. \\"Unchained\\" was the song that was played the most in the city that I lived in at the time. \\"Unchained\\" isn't the darkest song on the album, there's even some of Diamond Dave's humor in the song. With \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" the tone of the album really moves into the dark side. \\"So This Is Love\\", though not menacing in itself, is covering territory lyrically that's to one side of center. Nothing wrong with it but it does contain a dark presence not normally found in Van Halen songs. \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park\\" is anything but what the title implies. Eddie presents us with his first keyboard instrumental that won't let you nap pleasantly. This is a perfect lead-in to the next song, \\"One Foot Out the Door\\". This is another song that fits the terror that lies underneath the surface of the album.    Fair Warning is a very good album. Unlike the previous albums there's not an outstanding song nor any Van Halen classics presented here but... there isn't a bad one either. Many have overlooked this Van Halen near classic but those were ones that might not have been die hard Van Halenites either. As with the other Van Halen albums that have been remastered it's nothing short of excellent. This might have been a great direction for the band to have continued but they didn't. With their next album they would cross back over into their pop side, get us back on the dance floor & have us parting on the patio again.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|A must for every science-fiction movies enthusiastic. This 1080p compilation is a plus, as image quality is exceptional if you can enjoy it in a big TV.    Just a note: blue-ray discs are not like dvd, and so they have no world zones, you can buy this masterpiece in USA and (happily) enjoy it in Europe.
0439023483|5.0|I was hooked after the first chapter. I loved the main character Katniss and her strength of character. As I read the book I could picture the movie playing out in my head. Even though this was a little more fantasy than I normally like the human story was real and interesting. I would put a definate PG-13 on it for the violence.         I didn't know that this story wouldn't wrap up in the end so I was left hanging wanting more. Suzanne Collins when is the next one coming out. I can't wait!!!!!
0979660742|5.0|I received this book in very good condition and arrived on time as expected. I am very happy with how my purchase was handled. About the book, it is a very good reference for anyone who wants to be a good writer.
0375842209|5.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review until now because I feel so strongly about this book.  This story is told from such a unique perspective and is so creatively written. There is so much heart and feeling in this book that i was sad for it to come to an end.  I will definitely be reading it again and I've been recommending it to everyone, and so far I've gotten nothing but positive feedback.  It is a touching story with characters that you will truly fall in love with.  Read this book and even if you don't love it as much as I did, you'll still be glad you did :)
B0010358D0|5.0|I've enjoyed anime in the style of Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed.  Appleseed Ex Machina is a worthy sequel to Appleseed.  While the plot is not as intricate as one of the GITS movies, it's still engaging enoough to be enjoyable and a fun escape from reality.  I recommend this movie.
1402210086|5.0|\\"Cotillion\\" was actually the first Georgette Heyer book I have ever read.  I'd heard of Heyer through word-of-mouth and even in other novels (like Bridget Jones's Diary), but just never seemed to get around to reading one of Heyer's novels.  I am so happy that I did.  It's basically as if I've \\"discovered\\" Heyer and now I'm eager to get my hands on every single novel that I can.  I've read a lot of regency-inspired romances over the years and I have to say, that when it comes to realistic, this book is the closest I've ever come.  The dialogue is full of phrases and slang (like, \\"it's all the crack\\") and the mannerisms of the characters feel real and authentic.  Occasionally, I couldn't help but think that Freddie was gay.  Sorry, but it just kept popping up in my head every time he commented on someone's hat or shawl... -but I let it go.  One thing I was surprised about was the actual lack of overt romance.  Rather, it was subdued and subtle throughout the book.  I really loved this book.  Read it.  If you don't like regency romance novels, don't read it.  But then, I'm not sure why you'd be on this page in the first place if you didn't.
B0018S6YOE|5.0|After reading some of the reviews it is becoming quite apparent that we have some haters out there.This is an amazingly talented and beautiful young lady and in the context of this secular society what is there to complain about.Britney and that bunch of non-talent was allowed to make millions so why not Rhianna...i hope its not because she was born on the beautiful island of Barbados.For god sake if you can't leave a 5 star review then just \\"shut up and drive or take a bow\\".
B000002KGT|5.0|I can't think of a better release by any other band. 30 years of listening and it is the only album I can still stand. I remember so many times claiming that a different album is the best of all time. Such as the Wall, Styx's Pieces of 8, Foreigner's Head Games, Journey's Escape. I'm just naming a few but there are many others. Maybe Sgt. Pepper or Pet Sounds would beat out Rumors but I would walk away with Rumors if I had to chose. Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds were before my time anyway.   Lindsey Buckingham really put together a masterpiece here. My favorite song on the album is \\"Go Your Own Way\\". What a great breakup song that is! The reason I was checking out the reviews is I was curious who the $#!^ would give Rumors less then 5 stars? The Amazon average is 4.5 stars so some of you turkeys don't know good music. Maybe you put on the Britney Spears on by mistake instead of Rumors. :-)
0307346617|4.0|In need for a quick distraction between \\"heavier\\" reads, having read Brooks' other book _The Zombie Survival Guide_, and as a genre fan, _World War Z_ was an easy choice.  I was, in a word, impressed.  While his _Survival Guide_ was largely tongue-in-cheek, _World War Z_ fits more comfortably into the category of sci-fi, with a more serious take on the theme.<br /><br />Subtitled \\"an oral history of the zombie war,\\" Brooks' story arc covers the beginnings of the \\"zombie war\\", the reaction of various nation's leaders (and scientists) to it, the global spread of \\"zombies\\" and the reaction and resistance to them, with the eventual victory over the un-dead.  (Or \\"victory\\" as much as can be hypothetically possible.)  I was impressed for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />First, Brooks did a remarkable job of presenting a wide varitey of voices - from Chinese peasants, to Palestinian youths, to scientists, soldiers and civilians - even an \\"account\\" by a young woman who lost her mind as a result of the horror of the event - each character was unique, tied together by a common experience.  With a bit of suspended belief for the topic, the reactions, words and accounts of these people were wholly authentic-sounding.<br /><br />Brooks clearly gave the scenario a lot of thought in his \\"oral history\\" as well.  (This is apparent in his survival guide, too, but the matter is much more fully fleshed out - sorry about the pun - here.)  Issues of the spread of zombies, media and scientific reaction, and the political and economic reprocussions a \\"zombie infestation\\" would cause are almost painstakingly presented here.  The minute details made his \\"history\\" all the more believeable - for example, the challenges of fighting the un-dead with conventional weapons (designed to wound and kill the living, rather than the dead), or dealing with the un-dead in different climes are the sort of details that made the story come alive.<br /><br />What I found most impressive, however, was the underlying social message of his \\"oral history.\\"  Good sci-fi allows us to look at current problems with a veneer of safety and implausibility.  (Consider, for example, Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\")  The initial disbelief, profiteering, panic, chaos and resulting state of nature Brooks details as the result of a \\"zombie epidemic\\" is frighteningly similar to what the reaction of the world's populace would be to a *real* pandemic (or other global disaster of your choice.)<br /><br />This is a no-brainer (sorry - couldn't help myself) for zombie fans.  More serious readers may want to pass, although the authenticity and detail Brooks presents is impressive.is \\"oral history.\\"  Good sci-fi allows us to look at current problems with a veneer of safety and implausibility.

0307383415|3.0|Obama's story captured my interest, because it reads like a well written novel and it is a little bit exotic -- like anthropology 101, my favorite class as freshman in college.  But I tried to read it as a political document that it ultimately is and was surprised in how many places in his writing he left potential attack points lying around for the opposition to pick up, a few examples are the following:     On page 295, Mr. Obama is moved to tears by Reverend Wright's, (yes the fierce anti-American ranter) sermon. He leaves in the worst kind of ghetto language. Such a contrast to when he is speaking from his well written scripts.  Does he not realize that offensive words like that have the potential to increase the size of the hidden Bubba vote (voters who cling to their religion and guns not detectable by polls). He leaves the impression that he is forever struggling with his identity (black, white, Indonesian, Muslim, Reverend Wright Christian, Luo tribe in Kenya, whatever). His life is a journey to find himself. Many voters are bound to ask do we want his journey to lead to the White House. Will all the confusion disappear when he deep down asks himself: \\"Who am I?\\" and he can finally answer: \\"Mr. President\\"!? Or would he still be the Obama depicted in this book.  Would he make decisions in the national interest or would they be warped by an identity crises at the wrong time?
0375704027|4.0|It is always a hard task for me to review a novel by Murakami because of the sheer complexity of his work. This particular novel christened 'Norwegian Wood' after the famous Beatles' song has been looked at as one of Murakami's simplest novels where he was accused of succumbing to the story lines that he has prided himself on avoiding. After reading 'Norwegian Wood' I must say with absolute conviction that these accusations are indeed invalid and have been based on the apparent plot of the novel that at first might seem simple, it is true that there were no signs of any sheep or disappearing elephants in this novel, but it is far from being simple.<br />I think Murakami has taken a great risk with this novel in the sense that he had the courage to step out of what is natural to him and attempt to write a story in a different style yet he succeeded in making it his own. 'Norwegian Wood' is simply a love story but by saying that we have not even scratched the surface on the intensity of this novel. By the time Murakami was finished with it, this love story has sucked you in its nostalgic era of the 60's and enveloped you in the smells and sounds of every season from January through to December. This isn't just a love story, it is a coming-of-age story, and it is a story within a story. The characters have the definite Murakami style, selfless, sweet some even lovable yet all are intriguingly twisted such is the real world we live in.
B000RPSVE0|5.0|Out of context, the music on this memorial CD to the composers who were led to death at Terezin, Hitler's showplace among the concentration camps, could seem almost wistful. We get a snapshot of genres as separated as cabaret, simple lullabies, and serious classical lied.  One could be walking down the street in Berlin in the Thirties. But we are in Terezin instead, and wistfulness turns to tragedy. The lullabies come from a nurse wo chose to enter the gas chamber with her sick kids, still singing, rather than abandon them. The possibility for heartbreak is endless. The simple fact that almost every composer's dates end in the same year, 1944, triggers the specter of horror.<br /><br />Von Otter, Gerhaher, and company respect the dead -- as well as the music itself -- by not laying the pathos on thick. Some of these songs are miraculously light-hearted, a call to life in the valley of death. The most substantial composers are Victor Ullmann, Pavel Haas, and Erwin Schulhoff (a Nazi victim even though he died of tuberculosis in the Wulzburg camp and didn't go to Terezin).  Their songs, and Schulhoff's solo violin sonata, performed by Daniel Hope (whose mother's family fled to South Africa from Germany in the Nazi era) provide more advanced listening satisfaction.<br /><br />But I imagine most people will remember, and be haunted by, the simple melodies of the nurse, Ilse Weber, who went to die with the children of Terezin. This whole CD stands on the same emotional ground of devastation and grief. It's hard to come away the same person as before you started listening.
1401923119|5.0|The Biology of Belief, is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading.  Dr. Bruce Lipton addresses the ideas of genetic control and epigenetics, and how our perceptions and beliefs can affect our genetic health.  Dr. Lipton explains in detail the differences and the importance of the understanding of the placebo effect versus the 'nocebo' effect.  As he puts it, our negative and positive beliefs are a result of our programming from even before birth, as well as after.  These beliefs, particularly if they are negative can hurt you in an equally and powerful way as positive beliefs can heal you.  This should be no surprise, yet many are shocked to hear this information.  We have all heard stories of 'miraculous' recoveries from terminal illness through the power of positive thought and the the ability of focusing the mind on healing the body.  Dr. Lipton reminds us that negative thoughts cause the 'dis-ease' to begin with.  Through cellular biology studies, he proves the effects of negative stimuli on the cells, their 'parts' and the cell structure.  For those of us who are not scientists and cell biologists - this is a simplified discussion that provides a deeper understanding.  Further, he shows that we all have the ability to not only stop degeneration in our bodies, but we can actually cause the regeneration of damaged cells, organs, and tissues.<br />The power of intention to heal is required for healing.  Dr. Lipton explains the questions for anyone interested in health and healing through this one book alone.<br />As a parent, I cannot stress enough the importance to read this book.  In fact, Dr. Lipton addresses parents directly in one section of the book.  He realizes, and sends the important message that every second since our children were conceived - they have been receiving negative and positive stimuli.  As parents, it is up to us to learn how to remove our own negative programming so that we can pass those same techniques and skills, as well as the benefits from removing them - on to our children.  Take heart though, this is not a criticism.  Dr. Lipton reminds us that we are a result of our own programming and have not done anything wrong.  We are only 'wrong' when we are now aware of this information and we do not take the action to use it appropiately.<br />For those who would like to explore this in more detail, I would also recommend to visit DrWayneDyer.com and sign up for his newsletter.

B0000AEKCG|4.0|Hawkwind would begin a bit of a slide in quality with this album, although it is still quite good for the most part.  The band added second drummer Simon King to the mix which gives this album a duel percussion format that along with Lemmy's base made for an exceptional rhythm section.   Overall I don't like this album quite as much as the previous one \\"Hall Of The Mountain Grill\\", but it still has a lot to enjoy.  \\"Assault And Battery Part I\\", \\"The Demented Man\\", \\"Magnu\\", \\"Spiral Galaxy 28948\\" are all good.  Some of the spoken word stuff, especially \\"The Wizard Blew His Horn\\" sound very dated today, but the band take the sci fi concept to it's zenith with this release.  Many Hawkwind fans consider this to be the last release from the classic lineup as their later albums would be much more hit and miss.
B000PDZJ8U|4.0|Judging from the specs (Japanese/English subs and language) and the cover art (English text but no BBFC rating stamp the way a UK release would have), it looks like this might be the Japanese BD release of 'Ronin,' which has been out for a little while now.  I bought it myself for about the same price as this, and I've got to tell you that you may not find it worth it.  It's one of Fox's earlier MPEG-2 transfers and looks like most Fox movies of that vintage--slightly gray, slightly fuzzy.  It's still a leap above both DVD editions and it certainly doesn't look outright bad by any means...but unless the $45 pricetag means nothing to you, you might want to just wait to see if the eventual U.S. release gets a better treatment.    Edit:  Oh, and--again, if this is indeed the Japanese release--no features except for the theatrical trailer (and a few trailers for other Fox releases).
B001GGWFFA|5.0|David Gilmour, well known as the singer and guitarist of Pink Floyd, just released his new live 3-CD/2-DVD collection entitled Live in Gdansk and is a MUST for all DG and PF fans.<br />There's 2-CDs which feature 23 songs from his Gdansk, Poland performance recorded at the Gdansk Shipyard on August 26, 2006. 15 of the 23 songs (marked with *) are on the third disc and the first of two DVDs in this set which also has a documentary and webpass to download 13 tracks (including \\"Wots...Uh the Deal (performed at the Gdansk show but left off the CDs for time constraints) on this set).<br />Gilmour for this last show on his On an Island tour is backed onstage by PF 1987 alum which were keyboard player Jon Carin and bass player Guy Pratt, Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera, drummer Steve DiStanislao and the recently deceased Pink Floyd keyboard player Rick Wright. Plus, there's appearances by Zbigniew Preisner (who did the orchestrations and conducts the Baltic Symphony Orchestra) and Leszek Mozdzer on piano.<br />CD one begins with four from Dark Side of the Moon which are \\"Speak to Me\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Breathe (Reprise)\\" (all are excellent versions). The next ten tracks are the On an Island* portion of the show this time with an orchestra. \\"Castellorizon\\" is amazing. \\"On An Island\\" is superb (even without Crosby and Nash's harmonies). \\"The Blue\\" trumps the studio version. \\"Red Sky at Night\\" is more haunting live with orchestra and Jon Carin's Lap Steel playing counterpointing Gilmour's rare sax playing appearance. Next is a jazzy but rocking \\"This Heaven\\". We follow with \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" (with lap steel replacing Robert Wyatt's cornet) and an excellent version. \\"Smile\\" is superior to studio counterpart. \\"Take A Breath\\" is excellent here. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" is also superb. We end the first set with a great \\"Where We Start\\".<br />CD 2 starts with a excellent \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" (with wine glass intro). We follow with superb readings of \\"Astronomy Domine\\"* and \\"Fat Old Sun\\". The atmospheric \\"High Hopes\\"* is next and best solo Gilmour version. Next is a 25-minute spellbinding version of \\"Echoes\\". \\"Wish You Were Here\\" follows and is excellent. We then get a surprise out of \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\"*. We end with a jawdropping version of \\"Comfortably Numb\\"*.<br />The second DVD (disc four) contains more pieces from the Mermaid Theater concert from March 7, 2006. Also we have more from AOL's Music Sessions, Live from Abbey Road Studios. Plus we have three Barn Jams included recorded at Gilmour's home in Sussex, England. We also get On an Island in 5.1 Surround Sound. Lastly, there's some Easter Eggs that I cannot give away and you will have to see to find out.<br />The five disc version (which is only available in the US at Best Buy)  includes a third live CD including rare performed tracks like \\"Dominoes\\", \\"Find the Cost fo Freedom\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\".<br />Sadly, this set features the last work of founding Floyd keyboard player Rick Wright who sadly passed away a week before this set's release and is a fitting swan song to the musical soul of Pink Floyd and Gilmour's old friend.<br />This box set is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!d \\"Fat Old Sun\\".

B000VNMMR0|3.0|Live Free or Die Hard starring Bruce Willis is the 4th installment in the Die Hard franchise. The last film was 15 years ago and John is still a tough as nails cop. Justin Long is pretty good as well, nice comic relief, always liked him on the t.v. show Ed. The stunts are pretty outrageous (that's a good thing), and the plot is intense, great music as well. I am not a huge fan of action flicks but this one is pretty entertaining, Die Hard 2 is the best in the series but Live Free or Die Hard shall make your aderaline pump profusely, enjoy!

B000002NAK|4.0|The Evita Soundtrack is a wonderful and huge collection of broadway songs from the motion picture. Madonna has a great and emotional voice but I always thought Madge was a fabulous singer. Antonio Banderas has great chops as well, who knew? You will love this soundtrack, it's lively, moving, and pure broadway. Enjoy!
B000059TEQ|3.0|'Love Story' was the talk of the town in it's day, but the years have not been too kind to the film. The story of the rich man meets poor girl is interesting enough, but the dialogue is a bit dated. O'Neal and MacGraw are appealing, but both characters have feeling of inadequacies that make them slightly irritating. In the end, the love between them is believable and heartfelt, insuring the finale being quite sad. The film score is so recognizable, it's like the definitive score for romance films! Look fast for a young Tommy Lee Jones! The DVD has a good transfer and the extras are interesting.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Hello All Metal Heads,   I have been listening to these guys for 16 years now, since I was 16. They have had great  albums like puppets, lightning, black and load, irrespective of their style changes.  They had some great performances even on Re-Load I guess(memory remains & Fixxxer).   But I must admit - they have become dull. The dullness started with Re-Load, and continued  with St. Anger and Death Magnetic. I don't hear anything great or special on Death Magnetic.  They have released just 2 albums in the last 11 years and neither of them are great or   special. I think it is over for Metallica. I don't think I will bother to wait for the next  album. It does not take a great band to release albums like St. Anger and Death Magnetic.   Please try the latest from Iron Maiden and Judas Priest (Matter of life and Death and   Nostradamus). They still sound great.    Lakshman M P
0060786523|1.0|I love Indian fiction, and have read a lot of it over the years.  I also love a fat, meaty book that I can sink my teeth into.  So imagine my excitement when I found a work of Indian fiction with a mind-boggling number of pages.  I read the flyleaf, the story was interesting.  I sat down in the bookstore and read the first few pages and said, yes, this is the book for me.    I brought it home and dove in.  700 grueling pages later, I came to the unhappy conclusion that there was just no way I was ever going to finish this book.    Is it a political story? Is it a cultural story? It's both.  Unless you have a fairly serious grounding in Indian politics, you are going to have a rather hard time getting involved in the chapters dealing with the political aspect of this novel.  The political chapters switch back and forth with the cultural part of the book, and unfortunately, each segment drags on so long, that by the time you get back to the political part, for instance, you don't even remember what's going on, and vice versa.  The characters are not well-developed, and again, so much time drags on between characters, it's really hard to care about any of them.    Do I wonder what happens to one character and his hooker friend? I did when I first read about them, but after dragging through a lengthy chapter on Indian political processes, not so much.  Do I hope Lata finds her \\"suitable boy\\"? I guess, but I don't really care.  There's nothing about these characters to make you care for them.  You get no sense of what makes them tick.  There is simply too much going on in this book.      The author should have worried less about achieving some kind of mass epic and a little more about giving us sympathetic, interesting characters.  All in all, this book was just awful and I don't recommend it at all.
B001DHXT2A|3.0|Way better than the Ang Lee movie, but the plot is a bit silly IMO.  The general sends tanks and soldiers and such to \\"capture\\" the hulk, which pisses Bruce off leading to an inevitable confrontation between the green monster and the army...  All the mess and the rest could easily be avoided by simply dropping a roofie in his drink.  It's that glaring plot hole that really kills the movie for me.  Any intelligent being would send a hot chick to his apartment and drug the guy and call it game over.      While having an idiot general in charge of tanks, helicopters, squads of special forces, and other weapons leads to vastly more explosions, I'd much rather see an intelligently designed plot with characters who aren't retards.
B000006045|5.0|WHOA.  Did I read that somebody skips-over \\"Inertia Creeps (#4)??\\"  Wow.  That's pretty crazy, given that \\"Inertia Creeps\\" is one of the dopest songs on Mezzanine.  It's like being in a knock-down-drag-out fist-fight in slow motion.  What's not to like about that?  AND people down-grading \\"Black Milk?\\"  What are you guys thinking?    #7 \\"Man Next Door\\" is my least likeable, but overall this album is epic as far as 90's music goes.  Well yeah, it's pretty epic overall.    And seriously, give 100th Window more of a try.  Songs like \\"Future Proof\\" and \\"Special Cases\\" are vintage Massive Attack. Period.
B000P12LWY|3.0|I would never expect Showtime to produce first rate historical drama. That is not what they do. Showtime is in the business of slick entertainment, and that's exactly what they've given us in The Tudors. With the exception of PBS and, at times, The History Channel, it is fatuous to count on the entertainment industry to teach us history.<br /><br />Viewed as mere entertainment, The Tudors is a  success. It's got visual impact, conspiracy, treachery, sex, arrogance, and power plays. And beautiful people in all the important roles. Television so often offers so little in the way of compelling programing that this series is a welcome way to while away a rainy evening. But for true Tudor history, find a good book.
B000001C6M|5.0|Fast lyrics, fast instruments and an overall evil presence that defines the very word, 'SLAYER'. Tom Araya's 'theatrical' vocal style is reminiscent of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Although it sounds as if Tom plays catch up with the rapid guitar leads, he plays it off with a long range of 'war cry falsettos' and an enduring, almost storytelling vocal style. Before a time of computer-accurate instrumentals, bands like Slayer were incorporating raw talent, in this case Hanneman and King's guitars, into their sound; a sound of rebellious Rock n Roll and evil thinking.<br /><br />If you are inexperienced with Slayer, I'd recommend you start with 'Show No Mercy' to understand and learn the beginning stages of what they would become which is, undoubtedly, Heavy Metal Icons.
0743277708|5.0|I bought this as a gift as I had read the book before and thought it would be a suitable present.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This soundtrack is nothing short of a cultural revival.  If it took a wonderful movie and its soundtrack to bring this music back to the forefront and garner the attention it received and deserves, so be it.<br /><br />What better way could there be to reintroduce such wonderful music?  At the moment I can't think of any.<br /><br />Like many have said before there's not a bad track. This soundtrack is full of surprises and rich nuances that make it a joy to listen to over and over again.<br /><br />Even if you haven't seen the movie this soundtrack is worth getting.
B00005JPS8|3.0|Okay, the movie's fine, but if they're going to give you two disks, why can't they include the freaking full-frame version for those of us who hate trying to see what's between the two black panels?<br /><br />The script is well written and the movie's well cast; still, the effects are no better than one sees in some U-Tube productions. If you're going to put someone in a metal suit and send them zipping through the sky, you can do much more than was done in this film. It screamed \\"computer generated,\\" which was a shame. I could have done much better with an empty Iron Man suit, a helicopter, some cables and some clouds. When is Hollywood going to realize we don't need to see protracted shots of Iron Man flying? Put a camera in an airplane or helicopter, shoot at a high framerame and get as close to the ocean or land as you can get and go.<br /><br />I never thought, with technology being as good as it is today, that I'd be sitting back in a theater seat and thinking, \\"Fake! Fake!\\" If my standards were that bad, I'd still be watching LOIS AND CLARK reruns and save money in watching this stuff!<br /><br />Still, the movie makes it solely on the script, though stylistically I thik it could have been better. The actors and writers can't be faulted.
1427202834|5.0|I loved this one. Jeffrey Archer wrote a very compelling thriller, with interesting twists and turns. I found myself listening to it every where, not only in the car. The narrator, Roger Allam is excellent, he does a wonderful job of changing voices and accents so there was never any doubt in my mind which character was \\" speaking.  I listen to many audio books and it is rare that one will keep me awake at night, usually if I listen at bedtime I fall asleep and have to rewind to the spot where I dropped off. Not with this book. I had very dark circles under my eyes for a couple of days with this one.  Any thing else I could say in review of this book would just be repetition of the positive comments by other reviewers, but I highly recommend this \\" read\\" . It is also a good idea to follow up this book by reading The Count of Monte Cristo.

With that said, Robert Kiyosaki has predicted everything that is happening right now many many years ago with the financial crisis from Wall St to Real Estate crashes, everything. This guy knows what he is talking about.<br />Now he is on a mad crusade speaking in cities on how you can benefit in this type of market.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I received this sweeper as a Christmas gift almost two years ago and I absolutely love it! If you are expecting a vacuum, you will be disappointed, it has no suction, however if you want to use it as a sweeper, it's great! The best part in my opinion is that I don't ever actually have to use it! My 6 and 8 year old children are the first to volunteer to sweep the kitchen floor and clean up their messes when they dump popcorn, crush chips on the floor, or whatever. I always had to take care of those messes before because my kids have no concept of how to sweep dirt into piles, or get it into a dust pan. I love how it recharges because they can run it all they want without using electricity or running down batteries. Over the almost two years I have had it I have noticed that the battery life is somewhat less than it was, but it still runs on fairly heavy use for a couple of days before I have to recharge. I have found it light, easy to use, and easy to empty. My mother in law even bought one for her camp to use on the hardwood floors after using mine.
0375826726|5.0|Wow!  I was really surprised by this novel.  After I had reread Eragon and Eldest, I discovered that Paolini's world grew more and more detailed, and was anxious to learn more about Alagaesia with this novel.  In the same way I thought Eldest topped Eragon, so this book tops Eldest.  Full of suspense, I couldn't put it down.  Give it a chance, for it's by far the best of the three.  Absolutely terrific!
B001BGTWXI|4.0|Where does Corey Taylor find the energy to carry 2 successful projects and make excellent music on both sides of the fence? Along with touring? Who knows, but I must say, this CD is full of energy. He gives a great vocal performance and the band brought the speed, anger, energy and creativity again. Impressive.<br /><br />A bit more in the 'Iowa' vein speed wise on the heavy tracks. But not a 'forced' heavy. There are still the tidbits of melody and a couple more accessible tracks like those that made Vol. 3 so good, but for the most part this is an audio assault! Production wise it doesn't get much better. Crystal clear without that in your face heavy sound many CD's today have (Metallica for one). The only real throwout on this is the track 'Dead Memories' which just sounds out of place. At least the chorus. Cries out 'single wanna be'. Doesn't work for me. Skip that one. 'Butchers Hook' is average. 'Snuff' isn't perfect. Very Stone Sour with an excellent vocal performance, just doesn't really fit in terms of flow, with the other songs on the disc. I will say it is a good song though, just is better on its own or on a SS disc.<br /><br />But as far as the good: There is the track 'Gehenna' which is very, very old school Korn sounding, I mean big time,  but it is an excellent track of pure atmosphere. Nice.. 'Wherein Lies Continues' has a different, sludgy sound with a nice chorus. A different style for the band structure wise. A really good track that goes from heavy to a catchy chorus without sounding horrible as 'Dead Memories' does.. \\"Sulfer' is a great track that is probably the best song and the closest to their core sound. Energy and melody in perfect amounts. \\"Gemetria', 'This Cold Black' and the title track are pure mayhem, in the Iowa vein but more structured. The Drums are also high in the mix on this disc giving the songs an extra kick in the as*! Jordison gives another excellent performance throughout, but especially on the faster tracks. The drum emphasis on the heaviest tracks cant be denied and really give the songs structure. The missing element on 'Iowa'.<br /><br />As a Slipkont fan of all 3 discs, I would say this is a great follow up to Vol. 3. Much heavier than I expected. Any previous or current fan should have this. The band is staying true and sound-wise, this CD is crisp and clear. Must say its better than I thought it would be. One of 2008's best discs.<br /><br />If you dont like it, your not listening.viest tracks cant be denied and really give the songs structure. The missing element on 'Iowa'.

B001FB4W0W|2.0|Truly, I am disappointed with this series! The books are way better! HBO has done a disservice to this wonderful series. Blood Ties on Lifetime back in 2006 was ten times - no, a hundred times better than True Blood. I have ordered HBO specifically so I could watch True Blood. I was willing to give this series a chance, but by Episode three, it became evident to me that all there was to this series was soft porn! I mean, the brother is a HO, a tru MANBO, he is a slut and a self invovled moron, which you can kind of laugh at his exploits, I mean its obvious what he is. But then suddenly everyone, everywhere in the series was getting it on. They took a wonderful imaginative idea and turned it in to a Porn Flick. And way too much bad language. Every word is a cuss word, I swear it. The only redeeming qualities in this show is that has amazing music in the background, very moving music, from modern rock to violins that make you breathless and turn a moment into a truly moving one. So the music gets ten points but this show only gets a 2 outof 10! That's right! This show sucks, big time! Sucks with big pointy teethe and porno!
B000WO251Q|5.0|No doubt about it. Nicholas Sparks is a good storyteller. From the first page, I want to be left alone to read undisturbed. The story moves along from scene to scene in a smooth fashion.    \\"What does it mean to truly love another?\\" The answer is found in this a love story about a man's life, but this is not an expected romance between a man and a woman. It's easy to see that Savannah and John are meant for each other; however, love goes beyond romance. The relationship between John and his father is also closely examined. The friendship of John and Tony, his army buddy, is believable.    The story takes place in North Carolina and spans several years, including the 9/11 attack. Autism and Asperger's conditions are written about with great care, giving me a bit of an education. The pain of old age and illness are included. The dialogue is well written; the characters are realistic.    Although there is the gratuitous sex scene, I liked this book. This book should be read!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Reviewers who received advanced copies of the Iron Man Blu-ray release reported that the Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) flag was active on the Dobly TrueHD audio track, causing a less-than-stellar audio experience for customers who weren't savvy enough to adjust their player and amplifier to compensate.    The good news is that Paramount confirmed on September 25th that they had recalled all of the defective copies and replaced them with newly-authored discs that fix this issue. [...]    This recall occurred prior to Iron Man's release, so no one should have wound up with a defective copy except for the reviewers who received their copies in advance.

0312427999|4.0|\\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is a book about organized crime...at the state level. The state has several advantages over traditional mafia organizations: First and foremost, the state doesn't have to pay off law enforcement, the state IS law enforcement. There are no trials for the state's racketeering, torturing and killing. There isn't even any evidence that a crime was commited...at least there isn't any evidence that people are allowed to view. And even if there is evidence, George Orwell writes in \\"1984\\", \\"Big Brother told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears and you would have to believe them\\".     Ms. Klein begins her first chapter by telling the reader about the ultra-secret CIA mind-control program known as MKULTRA. She writes, \\"...the United States Central Intelligence Agency had funded a Montreal doctor to perform bizarre experiments on his phychiatric patients, keeping them asleep and in isolation for weeks, then administering huge doses of electroshock as well as experimental drug cocktails including the psychedelic LSD and the hallucinogen PCP, commonly known as angel dust.\\" These patients \\"had been used without their knowledge or permission as human guinea pigs to satisfy the CIA's thirst for information about how to control the human mind\\". These experiments reduced patients to \\"preverbal, infantile states\\".     This treatment, according to Klein, was administered to Jose Padilla for three years. That's how long it took to break Padilla down to a defenseless state. Although the dirty bomb charges were dropped, due to nonexistent evidence, Padilla was tried on far lessor charges and found guilty.    The state needed somebody to look like a terrorist so the \\"war on terror\\" wouldn't seem so...fraudulent.    The second advantage the state has over traditional mafia is unlimited resources with a penchant for travel. Klein visits Chile first. She writes, \\"the U.S. Senate...uncovered a far-reaching conspiracy in which ITT had offered $1 million in bribes to Chilean opposition forces and 'sought to engage the CIA in a plan covertly to manipulate the outcome of the Chilean presidential election'\\". State \\"Don\\" Henry Kissinger was the kingpin in this criminal mission. Kissinger's hired thugs \\"launched twenty-four rockets into [Allende's] palace\\". Kissinger puppet, Pinochet, then replaced the murdered leader. Now it was time to go to stage two-squash dissent. \\"Thousands [of civilians] ended up in the two main football stadiums in Santiago, the Chile Stadium and the huge National Stadium. Inside the National Stadium, death replaced football as the public spectacle. Soldiers prowled the bleachers with hooded collaborators who pointed out \\"subversives'; the ones who were selected were hauled off to locker rooms and skyboxes transformed into makeshift torture chambers, Hundreds were executed. Lifeless bodies started showing up on the side of major highways or floating in murky urban canals\\". The idea as explained by Ms. Klein is that once the population was \\"shocked\\" into a submissive state, they were willing to accept anything their government proposed. What the government proposed is the crux of the conspiracy: sell off the state-owned assets to American companies. Sell everything, oil and gas companies, telephone, electric, waste, construction companies, banks and financial companies. Kick the poor off their land, as Sri lanka did after the tsunami, so the big hotel companies can have the choice beaches. The losers in this wealth redistribution racket are the powerless, the little guy, the guy who has works his butt off to feed his family and provide a place to live. The economic policies forced upon the country produce hyper-inflation and massive unemployment. The suicide rate goes through the roof. The American corporate state makes billions. If the country doesn't comply with these policies, the IMF and the World Bank sends no aid.     \\"...the secret police would dispose of some victims by dropping them into the ocean from helicopters 'after first cutting their stomach open with a knife to keep the bodies from floating'\\".     Ms. Klein chronicles this mafia racket to Indonesia, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Poland, Russia, the Asian Tigers, and of course Iraq and Afghanistan.     Yes, it's a disheartening story. Ms. Klein validates everything John Perkins writes about in [[ASIN:0452287081 Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]] (see my review). With so much money to be made, you don't suppose the pathological profiteering American Corporate State would actually manufacture these disasters do you? See the book [[ASIN:0805978909 Don't Weep for Me, America: How Democracy in America Became the Prince (While We Slept)]].  This, and \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" will tell you everything you need to know.
B0013FYTA8|2.0|But this album blows. I've been a huge TOAD fan since they came out, but this album just sucks.

I was extremely disappointed, and I'm glad I got some of these songs for free.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Wonderfully sterile (and very, very safe) MOR (middle of the road) pop. Most notable for Brian Eno actually producing a clunker of an album - a rare occurence. His production values don't save the uninspired music or childish lyrics but no doubt, as clear as day, Eno's presence is Gwyneth Paltrow's husband's band's way of saying: \\"Hey, guys - see, we're serious musicians! We don't just write music for television commercials.\\" It is most obvious in it's attempt at being \\"serious\\".     Music died ages ago but apparently it's mummified remains shall be commercialized until it's nothing more than a pile of ashes.    I really hope Gwyneth Paltrow's husband's band stops lowering the standards of MOR muzak...
B00005JPF9|1.0|\\"Alatriste\\", based on Arturo Perez-Reverte's five Capt. Alatriste novels, chronicles a number of the Captain's adventures, over the course of about 20 years. These include service in the Spanish army in Flanders and intrigues at home in Madrid. Captain Alatriste (Viggo Mortensen) is like a Spanish version of D'Artagnan, and this movie is set at approximately the same time as \\"The Three Musketeers\\", with many of the same historical figures throughout.    I have only read one of the Capt. Alatriste novels (the first one), and the problem with that novel was that there was too little material spread over too many pages. It was as if Perez-Reverte was holding back for the later novels in the series (he probably was). \\"Alatriste\\" the movie has the opposite problem. There is too much material condensed in to too little time. This 2 ½ hour movie is based on all five of the Alatriste novels and as a result the film flies through event after event, giving the audience little chance to become acquainted with the characters or to figure out what is going on. Even the first section of the film, which was based on the book that I had read, was hard for me to follow and by the end of the film, I couldn't figure out what was happening at all and didn't really care. Evidently much attention was paid to making this film as historically accurate as possible and many of the costumes and scenes look like something out of an old painting. However, that is not enough to sustain such a long film. At the time of writing this review, \\"Alatriste\\" is very difficult to obtain on DVD. Don't bother going to the expense and difficultly of digging it up.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have never been a fan of Beatles music, and yet I love, love this movie. Most of the songs I've only been vaguely familiar with, but the power and emotion behind them in this movie, and the sheer entertainment involved with others, have left a lasting impression on me.  I thrilled at Eddie Izzard's and Salma Hayek's appearences.  I find myself singing \\"Hey Jude\\" and one or two of the other songs to myself through out the day.   I caught Across The Universe on Starz I believe (maybe Showtime?) and knew I had to own it.

I think that this book is perfect for someone like me who is looking to transition from point and shoot to DSLR.<br /><br />His humor is tolerable if you keep in mind that he's trying to be light hearted.  Early on he states that his intent is to give advice to you as he would to a friend.  I suppose his humor is intended to be endearing.
0679731725|5.0|I'd heard of the movie but only decided to read the book after reading a blurb about it in a magazine recently.  The start of the book is rather slow, meaning there's not a lot of action drawing you into the story, but once you reach the middle and end of the book there is a wonderfully subtle anticipation created. Only a truly talented author could weave a story with so many layers.    You get a multi-dimensional character portrait of the narrator, Mr. Stevens, as you move through the books various memories and Stevens' inner dialogue.  This book leaves you both satisfied and grateful for such a magnificently subtle story. The imagery is great and the dialogue both funny and poignant. I loved it.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Well, I was probably the first person in the state of Arkansas back in 1983 that liked this band. Obviously, the glory days of RTL,MOP and AJFA will never return. Oh, how I miss Flemming Rasmussen. This is the Metallica for the fans garnered after 1990. Hate to say they could care less about their older fans but at least they are sober now and the therapy seems to have worked since you detect no real aggression in the music. Ce' la vie...
B001GLUQIS|5.0|What I love about Fringe so far is that you really never know what to expect in each episode. Let's drop all of the X-Files and House comparisons and call this show what it really is: pure storytelling genius that is completely unique and engaging. This latest episode only sets the bar higher for this incredibly hyped series.     Just as we expect, as the episode opens we are treated to a completely bizarre scene in which all of the passengers on a bus are frozen in a way you won't believe until you see it. We also have the mysterious young man who has been having visions of this and other previous \\"Pattern\\" events before they happen. As Olivia and her team investigate the events they soon discover that the man with the visions is in fact on old patient of Walter's. It seems the work Walter did has allowed his mind to tap into the \\"Ghost Network\\", which has become a type of secret paranormal radio frequency that is now used for communication between members of a clandestine group who may be behind The Pattern. In essence, his visions are nothing more than his brain intercepting and attempting to interpret those communications. Too off the wall? Of course! That's why we love this show!    In typical mad scientist fashion, Walter devises a plan to tap into the Ghost Network so they can track down the men responsible for the bus incident. And just when they get close...well, let's just say that things don't go according to plan. Alas, we are left with more questions and theories to ponder before the next installment.     This episode also gives us a very somber scene where Olivia is at John's funeral. You can't help but feel for this character and the torment she is feeling from her relationship with John and his betrayal in the end. Anna Torv has consistently given a great performance as the cold and mysterious Olivia, and something tells me there is a lot more going on with her than meets the eye. Already it seems as if Philip Broyles and Nina Sharp are fighting overher and making quite a fuss over how \\"special\\" she is. Only time will tell.     In the end, we are left with yet another surprising revelation that all but guarantees that we have not seen the last of John Scott (or at least his body). I love the way Fringe keeps me guessing and also the way the characters draw me in. John Noble is giving what might be the performance of his career as the eccentric and charming Dr. Bishop.     If you've been paying close attention you might have noticed a mysterious bald man in the background of the last two episodes. According to the previews for next week, it looks the bald man is back and I can't wait to see what he has to do with The Pattern. I have no idea what's coming next on Fringe and that's exactly why I love it.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Watching Speed Racer can lead to tooth decay. I've seen this movie at least four times since it's come out on DVD. I saw it a few hours ago, and I plan on seeing it again this weekend. And anyone who says this movie is \\"complicated\\" has no business critiqueing movies. The dummy who thinks this film is complicated probably thinks that Scooby Doo got robbed at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />I thought that Speed Racer's storyline was cliche: a small family business resisting corporate takover--how many films have used this premise? But, with Speed Racer, originality seems the least of its concerns; the storyline provides the infrastructure upon which to showcase the latest advancements in CGI technology, and in this sense, Speed Racer is--in its own way--as revolutionary as the Matrix, Larry and Andy's first CGI movie.<br /><br />The color palette is fun--almost oversweet, and when the cars are sliding, flipping, and bouncing around--like Hot Wheels in a pinball machine--the colors are loud and electric and psychotic. The CGI cars defy all the laws of physics stopping on dimes, turning on squares, changing directions in mid-air, dodging bullets, etc. Organic car movies like Bullit, or Ronin, or Mad Max, or Grand Prix are exciting on their own but there's a lot to be said of the artificial CGI cars and their cartoonish behaviors. Speed Racer has the best CGI since Transformers.<br /><br />Speed Racer didn't make a lot of money at the theaters. However, what people must remember is that Speed Racer isn't as high in the public's collective mind as properties such as Batman, Spiderman, and the Hulk are. The latter have been recycled for each successive generation; however, before the Wachowski's announced that they were making Speed Racer, who--besides old heads like me who actually remember watching Speed Racer way back in the '70's--heard of Speed Racer? DVD (and Blu Ray) will vindicate Speed Racer. I wish I could give it six stars. Thoroughly entertaining. Just don't watch it expecting it to be on par with Children Of Paradise or The Red Shoes. Oh, I almost forgot: when was the last time Christina Ricci looked this sexy?be on par with Children Of Paradise or The Red Shoes.

0307269752|5.0|This book had me engrossed from the first page.  I had heard the hype about this book and definitely was interested in whether it was justified.  I started reading this book on a flight to Europe for a business trip and couldn't put it down for the next several days -- always trying to squeeze a few more minutes of reading in or thinking about it during other times.  I'm glad to say that all the hype it generated overseas is certainly well worth it.  This booked hooked me and wouldn't let go.<br /><br />The story could be categorized within the mystery genre, but to do so would be an oversimplification.  Larsson creates some of the most vivid characters I have come across in a while and in the process takes on social and political issues in addition to being an unbelievable mystery novel.  At the outset of the novel, we encounter Mikael Blomqvist, a financial journalist who just lost a libel case against the most powerful Swedish businessman.  Blomqvist gets a mysterious call with a proposition from an elder member of a wealthy Swedish family that controls one of the other most powerful companies, albeit one whose best days are behind it.  The offer:  write a history of the family and all its internal strife, animosity and conflict.  The catch:  discover who murdered one of the young family members 40 years ago.  What's in it for Blomqvist?  A lot of money and the opportunity to bring down Wennstrom, the business titan he lost the libel case against.<br /><br />Against this plot, we also are introduced to Lisbeth Salander, a tatoo laden early 20s computer hacker from a dysfunctional family background.  The intersection of Salander and Blomqvist propels this book from 60mph to 120mph.  In Salander, Larsson creates one of the most interesting, unique and compelling female characters in recent memory.<br /><br />Sure, there are some implausible twists and the last 30-50 pages don't match the frenetic pace and excitement of the rest of the book.  However, in the end, this is one amazing ride.  I certainly hope that this book gets as wide an audience in the US as it has in Europe.  I look forward the publication of Larsson's next two books and it is with great disappointment that he died at such an early stage of his career.  At least we have the pleasure of this amazing debut.I certainly hope that this book gets as wide an audience in the US as it has in Europe.

0307269752|4.0|I really had trouble with the first third of this book. It was fairly tedious reading, and I almost decided to throw in the pile of \\"read later\\" books, but curiosity kept me going. How could it have such good reviews if it was not worth the effort? So I persevered and it was well worth it. The tangled webs, the girl with what is I think Asperger's is amazing. Very much worth struggling through the first third of the the book. I heartily recommend this book. It is a keeper.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|Former side-kick turned songstress, Demi Lovato started her Disney channel career as nothing more then Salina Gomez's best friend for life; but thanks to the success of camp rock and a collaboration with the Jonas Brothers this 16-year-old is on her way to being the next big princess of pop.    This might come as a shock-and-awe to fans of Disney's current pop maven Miley Cyrus, but truth be told Demi bolts out catchy, youth inspired tunes better then her Hannah Montana counter part and as an added bonus she dose all this without the country twang.     The album opens with a sugar and spice coated gum drop entitled \\"La La Land,\\" and continues to amaze with rock induced \\"Trainwreck,\\" which propels Demi's vocals into mysterious quasi-alt territory. Jonas sibs Nick and Joe (who co-wrote the album with Demi) croon on, \\"On the Line,\\" giving the song that Camp Rock final jam appeal. While bouncy, well paced, boy inspired songs such as \\"Don't forget,\\" (the song that shares the albums title), \\"Gonna Get Caught,\\" and \\"The Middle,\\" have the potential to bandage broken hearts of tween girls everywhere. And if that's not enough the finale song \\"Believe In Me,\\" brings the album home with an inspirational ballad on just being yourself at the end of the day that will reassure the Mitchie Torres in all of us.     So in short if you're a Miley fan you'll love or hate Demi even more because \\"Don't Forget,\\" is a bubblegum contender guaranteed to dethrone any similar sounding musical mogul, who is delusional enough in thinking that she still has a chance in the Magic Kingdom of holding on to her tween-pop-star crown and microphone scepter.
0385720920|2.0|This poor mans version of Fight Club is surprising ineffective. It seems that Palahniuk is a one trick pony, or maybe this is just the sophomore curse, it's unlikely that I'll trouble to find out, that's how disappointed I was.  The characters, instead of representing everyman, seem to be faker than those on a TV sitcom. The story, instead of giving voice to the existential angst of a generation, is simply flaccid nonsense. There is nothing here but a feeble attempt to shock. Very disappointing

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I know when everyone learned of a new Metallica album, those who were EARLY Metallica fans scoffed at the thought of another Load or Reload or maybe even the Black Album but, I'll take this offering over any of the mentioned. The last time Metallica had dimension of this magnitude was in '88. It sucks that it took 20 years for them to touch on the old magic that made them who they were but, at least they showed they still have some of the angst that flavored their old stuff. I just wish the sound was a bit heavier. IMHO, that might be the only element holding this cd down.

0810995212|5.0|Having waited for YEARS for a good book on Leyendecker, the wait is over. I am very happy with this product. The reproductions are very good. While the book does catalog all of the artists covers (SEP, Colliers, etc), the result is well done. Typically, there are nine covers on one page and on the facing page is a repo of the actual artwork from one of the covers. I think almost all of the full page images reproduced are from original artwork, and not reproductions of magazine covers. Very nice. Sure... it would be great to have all of the covers shown in full page glorious color, but we dont and we wont. It still deserves five stars. There are many \\"sketches\\" in oil shown that were created as studies, many of which are stunning in and of themselves. Also shown are advertising illustrations. Great!<br />Regarding the text, move on if your are looking for detail on the artist life. There is really nothing new here. There has always been little know about the artist and his boyfriend. Leyendecker was a profoundly private person, the result of which is that there is little personal information available. What is written is interesting, but of minor interest. Who is buying this book for the text? Please.<br />But as it now stands, this one is easily worth the price and five stars!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|In my opinion, Elizabeth Gaskell is as good as you get.  I personally love this film as well as \\"Wives and Daughters\\" even more than the Colin Firth \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  It gives a good picture of what factory-life was like for British workers, and also creates a beautiful love story.<br />The actors were superb.  I would watch this again and again just for the sake of seeing Richard Armitage.  He completely captures the audience's attention.<br />Warning, there is a bit of brutality and some images that would make one cringe.  But otherwise, this is a clean, beautiful film.
B001G52F2E|5.0|The Winchester brothers are back, this time trying to discover who brought Dean back from the dead and why. This is an excellent show for horror fans who like good characterization and lots of family drama. Jensen Eckles is wonderful as stoic older brother Dean, and Jared P is awesome as well.  The horror is decent without being too graphic of frightening, so mature teens can enjoy this too.<br /><br />I own all the seasons so far, and this one is off to an excellent start.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I was introduce to the Allman Brothers at an early age, as my parents are hippies. I'm not, though, however, I was lucky to have them as a musical influence on me. This album tops them all in my book. No group will ever be able to compose something like this ever again, and I think its this fact that is leads some people to not like it. The Allman Brothers really set the bar in the early 70's for future bands. They still tour today, but without Berry, Dickie, and most of all the greatest guitarist that ever lived, Duane Allman. Few bands pursue this form of music because no one will ever top the Allman Brothers. I believe people are just jealous and this causes them to not like the Allman Brothers. I don't really blame them. I play slide guitar and I know I'll never come close to playing like Duane, but every time I turn this album on my ears have orgasms. This was the first album my parents gave me, and I plan on giving it to my children as soon as they can comprehend what music is. If you're thinking about buying it, you shouldn't think twice, just do it. You'll thank me later, and probably see me or my parents at the next Allman Brothers concert. Peace.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is in my opinion one of the best Radiohead cd's period. Most when thinking about Radiohead immediately think about Kid A, completely disregarding Hail. But! That's a mistake. Hail.. has the brilliant songs: Myxomatosis, Backdrifts and The Gloaming. If you don't already own it, get it now. And if you can, see them live. It will give you an even greater appreciation
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I am in awe of this album. The band describes their sound as \\"baroque harmonic pop jams\\" which is pretty accurate except for the jam part which brings to mind those long, aimless and barely melodic exercises in ego-stroking which clearly this isn't. These are well-constructed and concise folk-pop gems with influences (to my ears) such as the Beach Boys; Crosby,Stills,Nash & Young (with emphasis on Crosby and Young); and Sufjan Stevens while remaining totally original. It's impossible to get a feel for the glorious harmonies, intricate instrumentation and lush melodies by listening to the half-minute samples on this site. They can be off-putting but trust me, the songs are true wonders. They often start off a capella and build into these magnificent aural fountains of joy. I usually list my favorite songs but this CD is so incredibly consistent it would be foolish of me to do so. Intended or not, this work seems to be a song cycle, with each excellent song adding up to an even greater whole. Music this good doesn't come around often so pick it up as soon as you can. Your musical life will be richer for it. The EP \\"Sun Giant\\" that precedes this full-length is fairly good but won't prepare you for the artistic leap of this achievement.
B00005JPS8|5.0|The first disc features 11 deleted and extended scenes. There's more of the opening ambush with Tony Stark being more proactive. We also see more footage of Rhodes and it quickly becomes apparent that he was the character with the most scenes cut from the film. We also see Tony and Pepper Potts attend another party.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive \\"I Am Iron Man,\\" a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production. For example, we are taken step-by-step through the construction of the Iron Man armor with Robert Downey Jr. cracking jokes while being fitted for it. It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person. This is due in large part to the genius of the late-great Stan Winston and his company. Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.<br /><br />\\"The Invincible Iron Man\\" is a six-part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character. Stan Lee says that he modeled Stark after Howard Hughes, for the most part. He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor - hence its many changes over the years. This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos. This is a very well done overview of the comic book.<br /><br />\\"Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man\\" examines the CGI work that went into realizing Iron Man's powers, like flying, his repulsors, and so on. Director Jon Favreau says that he likes to use practical effects whenever possible, which is wonderfully refreshing to hear, and in this film he mixed the practical with CGI.<br /><br />\\"Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test.\\" Incredibly, the actor had to do a screen test because the studio deemed him a risky proposition and this footage shows that he had a handle on the character very early on.<br /><br />\\"The Actor's Process\\" features fascinating footage of Jeff Bridges and Downey rehearsing a scene with Favreau.

0805079831|1.0|Before rating my review as unhelpful please read (if you review something negative on a political site you are usually ranked as unhelpful) I am really trying to save you some embarrassment.    I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Klien in 2006 while she was researching for this book at the University of Oklahoma (where her sister is a professor). She is an attractive, intelligent and hardworking woman, but horribly incorrect on many issues. I was not surprised that the author of  No Logo was once again conflating free markets with corporatism and taking the ideas of free market capitalism out of context in order to make a point.    Worse still, was her representation of Dr. Milton Friedman. For instance, she paints him as disliking democracy. In reality, Dr. Friedman hated the concept of Athenian democracy, not modern democracy. Athenian democracy is seen by the vast majority of political scholars as another form of tyranny. Friedman is an advocate of republican-democracy (democratic government with checks on power for both the minority and the majority).     Klien also has a tendency to conflate Dr. Friedman's love of free markets and limited government with governmental regulation and subsidization of businesses. Corporatism is not free market capitalism, no matter how hard Klien tries to equate the too. Corporatism is when government works to enrich corporations through subsidies, special tax breaks (that competition does not receive), tariffs, and regulations. The idea is to get government to pay and protect certain favored industries.     Dr. Friedman was against that. That sort of government interference in the market (which includes socialism, communism, and corporatism) is NOT free market.    I regret now, sitting silent (my friend paid me not to argue with her) when I heard her present her research. Not, that my corrections of her errors would have done any good. Another liberal professor did take her to task when she tried to argue that Haiti was became a failed state because of neo-liberalism. He pointed out that Haiti was a failed state before neo-liberals tried to reform and remained a failed state when the socialists retook control.    That said, she has a tendency to get historical chronology out of order. Another example is her claim that Dr. Friedman supports dictatorships and that Argentina is a prime example liberalism only working if a dictatorship pushes it through. Pinochet came to power in 1973 but the Chicago boys gained influence until 1975...after the violence had ended. Real market reforms were not put in place until 1979 after the SOCIALIST dictatorship finally relented.    In reality, Pinochet preferred command control socialism (he never had any free market plan when he took control), the idea that the economy would respond to marching orders naturally appealed to the military leader. Command control of the economy was not working and the economy continued to worsen, that is when market reforms began to unfold. I should also add that in the 1980s free market economists from Harvard came down to Argentina and moved the country further toward free market capitalism, by then the country was a democracy.      For a more in depth hammering of Ms. Klien's errors, see Johan Nordberg's review here: [...]  Please read that.     I am serious when I say that Ms. Klien has distorted ideas and conflated corporatism with free market capitalism. The corporatism cited by Ms. Klien is real and it is worthy of criticism. There was no bigger critic of corporatism than Dr. Friedman, even though Ms. Klien seems to think he advocated this.    That said, be warned. If you use this book as a textbook, or a resource, or to gather points for debate you will be utterly demolished by a free market economist or advocate. She does not actually explain free market politics or economics and you will not be well prepared for their counterpoints.    By using this book as a resource, you will only offer more points as to why government is bad - which in the end was one of the central themes of Dr. Friedman.
0452286751|4.0|Why did Ayn Rand write this book? That's a fair question to pose of any author, but with this particular author and with this particular book, it's an essential question. Was the purpose of the book its entertainment value, which is substantial, or was it to serve as a platform for objectivism, the philosophy prevalent throughout the book?     My personal feelings are it's probably about a 60/40 ratio with the bulk on the side of the philosophy. She makes such an effort to separate her main character, Howard Roark, from the rest of mankind and to show his lack of concern for anything outside of his own individual motivations, that he appears at times to be a little two dimensional. How else then could he hope to find happiness in his personal life except with a woman who is equally as unconcerned with rest of humanity as he is? While one bounces from one unfulfilling relationship to another, the other appears determined to destroy his own career in the pursuit of uncompromising ownership of the creative process. Still, you root for the hero and hold tight to the hope that substance and raw talent will win out over style and high society. But you're a cheering section of one, because not even the main character cares enough to join in.    The Fountainhead has substantial entertainment value however. Ayn Rand is a master of the descriptive scene as she focuses your attention to the most minute details such as the arch of Dominique's back in order to portray an atmosphere in a scene. In many cases, you may feel as though you're viewing a performance on stage rather than reading a book.     So, which is it? Entertainment or a thought-provoking examination? A little of both probably. I mean, isn't that what most great books offer?
B00002Z88D|4.0|This cd would appeal mostly to Metallica fans who want everything the band has ever done, or maybe fans of symphonies who like 'edgy' music. Sound quality on this recording is excellent (my favourite Metallica album, \\"Reload\\" has very poor sound, and I've heard very bad things about the sound on the band's new album \\"Death magnetic\\". It seems the sound quality on Metallica albums is very hit and miss. Here it's more 'hit'. Both the symphony and Metallica are clearly distinct on this cd, so one does not suffer in comparison to the other, prominence wise.       Of the songs selected for this double cd, I could have sworn I'd seen \\"Fade to black\\" on it when I looked at the track listing a while back. Maybe I was mistaken. That is arguable their best song and I think it would have worked really well on this cd. Some of my other favourite songs which missed an appearance on this cd were: \\"Welcome home\\", \\"Orion\\", \\"The unforgiven\\" and \\"The unforgiven II\\". There are probably lots of 'hardcore' Metallica fans who don't rate these songs that highly and rate more highly songs which did appear on this compilation. As I think the songs above are amongst the band's best, I'm disappointed that they didn't make it on to the album. The only other Metallica song which I consider an out and out classic, \\"Enter Sandman\\", does make the song line-up. \\"Memory remains\\" is a near classic and makes this cd as well. From their earlier albums, I don't mind songs like \\"The thing that should not be\\", \\"Master of puppets\\" and \\"Battery\\". All these songs are on this cd. Perhaps \\"Fight fire with fire\\" is in those songs' class too, and deserved to be on this album.        The only other point of comparison for this album that I have is a KISS symphony programme I saw on ABC TV in Australia (not sure how similar it is to the title that is available for purchase on dvd). My problem with some of the songs on that programme was that the orchestral arrangement actually detracted from some of the excellent KISS songs. In other words, the symphony didn't play to those songs' strengths. Perhaps that's an unfair comparison as I saw KISS on a portable tv and I heard S&M on a stereo with good headphones.       In this review's heading, I state that some of the band's original material comes out better on this than on the original album. Which is to say that songs on albums like \\"Load\\", which I really didn't find that interesting, sound more interesting with this arrangement. That includes songs such as: \\"No leaf clover\\", \\"Hero of the day\\", \\"Bleedin' me\\", \\"Outlaw torn\\" and \\"Sad but true\\".        If you're wondering if the symphonic treatment softens the sound of the band, \\"Battery\\" should dispel those fears. Of all Metallica's thrash songs, this one doesn't lose any of its accoustic brutality.       One possible gripe for this cd is that more use could have been made of the symphony. Personally, I would have liked to hear more isolated instruments carrying the melody of the song in the quieter parts. Especially if that instrument had a sound with character...I don't much about individual instruments in symphonies, but maybe something like an oboe, or a horn or something...maybe even a harp.        On one occasion, something approaching what I would have liked in that regard is achieved...in the intro for \\"Battery\\", for orchestra delivers a nice counter-balance to the thrash metal which comes after that. They provide a simple but effective arrangement for Metallica.       Since \\"Memory remains\\" is one of my picks as Metallica's best song, it's good to see that that is a hard song to stuff up...it works well symphonically too. You do get the crowd singing along the melody to that song, along with the symphony.        Which brings me to another gripe: crowd involvement would have been better on the recording if the microphones were nearer the audience or something. Iron Maiden's otherwise mediocre song \\"Fear of the dark\\" is turned into pretty much a classic by the crowd singing the melody in their \\"Rock in Rio\\" concert. That recording really captured the crowd's passion really well.       If you're after versions of songs which don't take liberties, then maybe this cd isn't for you. Hetfield occasionally stays silent so that the crowd can sing some of the lyrics of the song. Occasionally he adlibs or encourages the crowd, which may annoy some people who'd rather hear Hetfield keep to the script of the song.       Even though I'm not heavily into heavy metal, heavy metal albums which I highly recommend are:    Metallica: Reload (which is a great hard rock album); Master of puppets (their best early album) and The Black Album.     Coldseed: Completion makes the tragedy (a great debut album with lots of stylistic variation in the song list. Another two albums like that from them and I'd rate them as highly as Metallica!).
0765348276|4.0|This is an entertaining space adventure/war novel of the first order.Fast paced,well written and thought provoking.The science is fine and doesn't bog the story down.If you like old school classic sci-fi with a protagonist that can be funny but very serious in equal measure then you will really enjoy this novel.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I came into this film expecting lots of great special effects and computer imagery, but I was wrong. This film is very heavy on symbolism and the natural occurences in life, things like depression and hope. However, it manages for a short while to keep the two separated,but when the two come together that is when the film takes a turn to the dark side. This movie has violence yes, but it also has plenty of beauty and love. I watch every film hoping to leave the experience with a special message in my soul, and this film delivers. So, watch this film with a open heart and look at it as if you were a child not neccessarily an adult. Highly recommended from your Vaquero!
1400079179|5.0|I can't even go into detail about how amazingly compelling this book was to read, but one thing I have to stress is that nobody should watch the movie before reading the book first.  If you have already watched the movie, read the book and then watch the movie again because it will make so much more sense and make so much more of an impact.  Of course, the movie couldn't fit in everything that the book covered, but it did follow it fairly well.<br /><br />The storyline, the characters, the dialogue, etc. in this book are all so incredible that you don't want to put the book down once you start reading it.  However, most people would not be able to read this entire book in one day or even two.  It took me a little over a week to finish it because most people can't read a book all day long if they work or even if they don't.  I grant you, it's a lot of pages, but it is so worth the time because this is a very enlightening book in so many ways and gives insight into various aspects of not only religion, but things you never knew about famous art works.  I was never very interested in art, but this book was quite eye-opening.  I highly recommend this book to ANYONE.
B00168HARG|4.0|Usually, movie-inspired TV shows are like their video game counterparts, i.e. a cheap means of conning unwary viewers/buyers. Occasionally, we are pleasantly surprised by the quality of the work. Buffy comes to mind. And now, Sarah Connor Chronicles has the potential to do it as well.    The writing is superb. The acting is generally above par. The special effects are not major motion picture caliber but serviceable. Only the young John Connor is a little weak. Lena Headey's physique also compares unfavorably against Linda Hamilton in Judgment Day, but these are minor issues easy to overlook. Let's just hope that the series does not suffer a second season collapse a la Heroes.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I'm not going to theorize about why CM did what he did. I have no idea. I'm not privy to his mind and thus I have no way of knowing why he chose to do what he did. However, I will say this, I cannot, under any circumstances, fathom having the guts to walk into the wild and make a go of it. I can imagine it all day long but I doubt I could actually do it.    The movie is intense and amazing. It tells a wonderfully tragic story.    I'm incredibly tired of reading reviews of people bashing this man for his \\"ignorance\\". Of course he was. We all are. But what makes him unique is that he tried. He took a gamble and it didn't pay off as most people would hope. He still tried. So to all of the wonderful experts on survivalism and backcountry living.... take note... The Man was searching for something. We'll never know if he found it. Ultimately, something found him. Call it a wasted life but it wasn't your's to waste. It was his.    That being said... it is a very good Movie. Regardless of the assumed reasons for any of it.    Try to watch it.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|Terminator is one of the most important sci-fi/action classics in American film history. I am a big fan. I want to warn every potential purchaser of the Blu-ray version, however, of the fact that it does not provide anything close to HD imagery as a result of the deterioration of the original film stock over the past 25 years. In fact, the picture is so fuzzy that it is not even DVD quality. Save your money and get the DVD version instead.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|Why oh why does Hollywood keep remaking these remarkably scary Asian horror flicks? I mean, the American version of Ringu was equally scary as the original, but the others deserve an F. Ju-On: The Grudge, Kairo, Gin Gwai, and now this. \\"Shutter\\" is an absolutely terrifying experience. The Main Ghost in this movie is as creepy as Sadako from \\"Ringu\\". She's THAT scary. The smart scare techniques really work. And I'm really glad that I don't have to watch the American remake (which I heard recieved negative reviews from both critics and audiences). Hell, I'm glad that I don't have to watch ANY of the American remakes (One Missed Call, The Eye, Pulse, Dark Water, etc.)<br /><br />P.S. I keep hearing rumors that Hollywood is continuing on remaking Asian films. Have we really run out of ideas for a \\"good\\" Hollywood movie?

B000002KAT|1.0|I know that this is a classic, I know that it has sold a zillion copies and that it estblished Van as a \\"great and as an innovator.\\" I know that everybody has covered \\"Moondance\\", probably even The New Christie Minstrels.     In spite of all that, I cannot stand it. I am not concerned that it is very much of its time. I am not concerned that it was the start of endless records of two/three chord bashes. I am not concerned that it encouraged Van to play sax, which is not good. No, my dislike is very black and white - I can't BEAR his voice. It's a yes or no thing, I guess. I am sure that it is deliberate but he cannot seem to hold a note for more than half a beat, and his tone is so harsh. Listen to the middle section of Moondance - it would give an elephant migraine. From Veedon Fleece until the present day he seems to have a mouthful of marbles and a swollen tongue - and the end-notes are about one tenth of a crotchet.    When a flatmate played in incessantly when it first came out, those not in favour braced themselves in aticipation of the hard-edged squawks and clipped endings. It was christened \\"Astral Squeaks\\" and I cannot think of it as anything else. Also, I know that he is a very private person for one who tours endlessly, but why does he have to cultivate the on-stage persona of bad temper and aggression? You won't see that from Gary Brooker or any of his near-contemporaries, even on the Oirish scene.     I tried again recently becuase my boy is playing a few numbers in a band. No, sorry, it's still unlistenable.
031606792X|1.0|May contain spoilers.  Read at your own risk.    'Twilight' had a lot of potential.  It was a roughly written story with a lot of backstory, way too much tell, very little show, and little conflict or climax.  But the concept seemed fresh and that was enough to draw me in.  But from there, in my opinion, the series fell flat and imploded.  Bella turned into a morose, suicidal teenage girl who became obsessed with vampire Edward and behaved obnoxiously toward her father, mother and friends.  There was little to like about her and even less to like about Edward.  Jacob, who had potential as a strong friend and realistic love partner, became sour and bitter.  The underlying message - obsess over a guy, fawn over his looks and money and body, give up your friends and family, become depressed when the guy disappears, and believe you're the center of the entire universe and that everything and everyone revolves around you - is troubling beyond belief.  I can understand that maybe the author wanted to show imperfections in Bella's world and beliefs and thinking, but she missed the mark in using that to her advantage in the story.  Instead of watching a girl (I dare not even call her a teenager, her behavior is so juvenile) come of age and learn about life and love along the way, we're instead treated to a character who blindly swoons over a dead guy who's only goal is to keep her under thumb by manipulating her and telling her what to do.    What a headache.    I admit that I skimmed through parts of the third book so that by the time I got to 'Breaking Dawn', I had strong reservations about the series being able to deliver.  Turns out I couldn't even finish this last one.  By the time I got to Bella's pregnancy, I was too fed up with the fact that nothing was happening.  *Again*.  This was the third book in a row that, once again, gave us page upon page of Bella's whining, immaturity and lust/obsessive behavior toward Edward.  She behaved meanly toward her dad, Jacob, hermom and anyone else she came in contact with who wasn't a vampire.  And, in doing so, became a prime candidate for therapy, in my opinion.  No wonder her human friends left her.  I would have, too.    Okay, deep breath.  Sure, this is fiction.  But it's badly written fiction.  I mean, really badly written.  This smacks of Mary Sue in the biggest way, complete with a perfect protagonist that every character loves.  Bella gets what she wants as everyone panders to her desires, and acts nasty to whoever she wants, but the gods forbid that anyone is nasty to *her*.  Selfish doesn't even begin to describe her.      Now, I love to read about alternate universes (or however you'd label this particular piece of fiction), but please, make it realistic.  And at least work at making your characters, especially your protagonist, likable.  As it is, Bella is an obnoxious, arrogant kid who swings too quickly from highs to lows, much like someone with bipolar disorder.  It's too bizarre to even qualify.  And let's not get started on this whole 'love of my life' theme.  This isn't love.  Obsession, yes.  Lust, yes.  Immature and unhealthy, most definitely.  Perhaps if we were shown the progression of Bella's relationship with Edward with more realism, watching them struggle along the way rather than being beaten over the head with Edward's beauty and Bella's infatuation with it, the journey might have been far more enjoyable.  And more realistic, even for alternate universe or urban fantasy fiction.    Again, the first book had potential to build on this theme, but subsequent books failed to expand on it.  Add to that the story inconsistencies throughout the books so that the author could make all the pieces come together, and it all makes for a failed storytelling journey that deserves to be fed into a fire.    My fireplace isn't ready for the season yet, so instead I tossed all four books into the trash.  I'm disappointed I wasted my valuable reading time on any of this.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I bought the first season of the show entirely on a whim, never having been exposed to it in any way.  I was, quite simply, bored and the first season was the first thing to come up on my search.  After the first season I was hooked, so I ordered the second season as quickly as I could.    The action gets kicked up a notch for the second year, and without revealing too much about the events that take place, Sam and Dean do finally get to confront Azazel (the Yellow Eyed Demon) regarding their history and we find out a few interesting things about Sam in particular.  And the season's cliffhanger ending is an absolute must-see and it made me, in short, FLIP for the third season.    If you liked the first season this is a must-have.  The mythology gets a little intricate and you'll definitely want to have seen the first year ahead of time, but it's a definite must-buy for anyone who likes tales of the SUPERNATURAL.

I heard about it in a Q&A session on LinkedIn and decided to read it. Chris Anderson has soundly articulated how the democratization of production and distribution has changed the rules of the game. If you're a creative type trying to produce and sell your own stuff, this book will encourage you to forge ahead. There's a niche out there somewhere that is looking for you.
B0012GMZKE|5.0|New Skin for the Old Ceremony is grand record from Cohen. Once more Cohen showcases his immense talent with tracks such as Chelsea Hotel and Who By Fire. Cohen's lyrics are filled with immense intelligence, wit and sometimes a quirky sense of humour. The cover is very beautifull and depicts the spiritual union of the male and female principle. For some reason they made a cheap book-let and that is such a shame for such a wonderful recording.

He writes with a heartfelt sincerity that is not in the least phoney or forced. Nat Hentoff writes a short and informative essay on the record and then gives a synopsis to what all the songs mean to the singer. The only hang up is the lack of lyrics. That is a shame that they forgot to include this. This is certainly a timeless classic!
031606792X|1.0|*May or May not contain spoilers. Read at your own risk*<br />There are so many disasters within this book but I'm only going to focus on one because so many other people have illustrated and presented quite nicely why this book is flawed.<br /><br />I was excited to finally wrap up this series. I wanted to know how Bella and Edward would end up, though who didn't know she'd become a vampire? I was able to read the whole series this year only waiting two months for this book. I read no spoilers. I read no fanfics. I read this book expecting NOTHING except what I was told or rather suggested to expect all along. A romance between a vampire and a human. I was embarrassingly hooked on Bella and Edward and I wanted more.<br /><br />Here's an excerpt from the jacket:<br /><br />\\"Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fate of two tribes hangs.\\"<br /><br />This book is about Bella's choice. Her choice about becoming a vampire. I wasn't surprised when she became a vampire. The anticipated wedding could have been ROMANTIC like what was advertised about her relationship. We get to read about the upcoming wedding in Eclipse only to have the wedding blur right by us. What was Bella's wedding dress even like? I got the feeling that she didn't care one bit about a wedding. Okay, it's Bella and she doesn't like to be the center of attention but she is marrying her love, the guy she cannot live without, the guy she would possibly die for. This event could have been a great thing for this book but it was overlooked. I felt just as rushed as Bella reading about it as if the author wrote it just to get it out of the way. Nothing romantic about this wedding (not saying that all weddings are romantic but this is \\"just a book\\" right? Why not dazzle us with more romance?)<br /><br />Here's one more excerpt:<br /><br />\\"Now that Bella Has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating and unfathomable consequences.\\"<br /><br />Bella made her decision. Now she has to have a devastating consequence. But what? I am still trying to figure out what her consequence was. Giving up Jacob? Giving up her family? Being in pain for the first year as a newborn? Oh wait, it's giving up having children, right?<br /><br />Exactly. Not only do I read about Loch Nessie that should not have been but Edward and Bella get taken away from me. Where's the romance? It's replaced by that thing and Bella's ex. And what about Edward? There were too many new elements and surprises that did not fit in with the whole series. So many in fact Bella and Edward's relationship was sacrificed. That's right, that was the consequence, the thing that Bella had to give up. This read like a bad soap opera. This book is just an empty shell of what could have been a good young adult vampire drama/romance story.<br /><br />P.S. I have to admit this book was so bad I could not finish it. I had to skip through some parts to read what happened in the end. This book lost my interest so quick and took the longest to read out of all the books in the Twilight Series.

B000GFLAI0|4.0|Modern Times by Dylan's latest release is a very good record. Modern Times became Dylans first #1 in the U.S. since his 1976 release \\"Desire\\". There are many fine tracks on this record, i.e., Spirit on the Water, Someday Baby to mention a few. The book-let is very thin and contains no lyrics.

0385340990|5.0|As I read through the pages of this book, I had a picture in my mind - of sitting in an armchair, by the fire, with a pot of coffee and some pastries for company:) Yes, it is that kind of read - warm, comforting and conjuring mostly pleasant thoughts [though with WW II as one of its themes, there were sad thoughts too]. And of course, I had to know how Guernsey itself looks like - I went on the web and came across many beautiful photographs of this majestic and bucolic island.<br /><br />Well, the novel itself is written in an epistolary style - with a series of letters exchanged between the various characters that people this book.  The main character is Juliet Ashton, a successful writer and newspaper columnist who is very much a free spirit and strong-willed, yet yearning for true love. Juliet receives a letter from a certain Dawsey Adams, a pig farmer who is also quite well-read and an ardent fan of the author Charles Lamb. He writes about a literary club that was founded on the spur-of-the-moment on Guernsey during the Nazi occupation of the Channel island. Juliet's interest and curiosity are piqued and as she delves deeper into the German occupation of Guernsey, she comes to be intimately acquainted [via a series of letters] with the various members of the society and even a few islanders who aren't members. A trip to Guernsey sets off a chain of events that not only give Juliet solid material for a book but also unleashes some hidden passions and yearnings that find resolution in the novel. There are so many themes in this little novel that will appeal to various tastes - Anglophiles will delight in the descriptions of post-WW II London and Guernsey, the living conditions etc, bibliophiles will love the fact that all the people in this book bar a few LOVE reading books, and WW II afficionados, especially those with an interest in the Nazi occupation of the Channel island of Guernsey will find a riveting read in the descriptions of the harsh living conditions under the German occupiers, the deplorable conditions in the camps such as Ravensbruck and Belsen, and the emotional impact on the survivors.<br /><br />Though the book is an absolutely engaging read, I was saddened to learn the author, Mary Ann Shaffer is deceased, this being her only novel.She put years of research into the novel and after her illness and eventual death, her niece Annie Barrows helped complete the novel.<br /><br />Final verdict: a book that enchants and saddens, uplifts and inspires!

B0012GMVDK|5.0|The Future being Cohens 1992 release is nothing short of a stroke of genius. It starts out with a bang with the track The future. Cohen is such a talented lyrcist that I consider it to be the perfect mix between poetry and music. His vocals are as solid as ever before. The book-let is very interesting. On the cover we have a bird, a heart and a pair of handcuffs. It contains both lyrics and also a list of who played and what instruments they used. Sharon Robinson once again is collaborating with Cohen and as I written before I think this is a such an amazing combination. Waiting for the Miracle is my favorite track. This track is pure gold!

It is a drawing that looks it was drawn by someone that was drunk in bar. \\"Ok, Bob, I have had like 10 beers, let's draw the cover for your latest record\\".

The \\"Super Heroes\\" all have their own neuroses and as the novel ended I just didn't really care for any of the characters except for Dr Manhattan.<br /><br />Anyway, it may be a bit overhyped. Maybe I expected more and was let down.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We watched the John Adams DVD after purchasing it on Amazon.com. It is awesome! At times very graphic, the movie is realistic and thought provoking. It makes a serious statement about war, frienships and alliances, loyalties, marriage.....and history of course! According to the movie, there was nothing glamorous about life in the 1700's. The depictions of Adams and his compatriots are fascinating, with Thomas Jefferson and George Washington fairly accurately portrayed, in additon to Adams himself. The men respected each other but they were clearly not friends. Although he was not as popular as Jefferson or Washington, Adams did what he believed was right and stood up for his own ideals. His legal defense of some British soldiers was based on his own ethical standards and what he believed the United States was all about....that all men were entitled to representation, regardless of their belief systems. He endured ridicule and threats as a result of his defense of the soldiers--but he was right! An inspiring film! Very well done! Excellent acting.
0307269752|4.0|I read this book after reading the numerous reviews on Amazon. I was not disappointed in this book. The main character is a journalist who is sued (and eventually jailed for a short time) after a slander suit is filed against him by a Swedish Corporate big shot. While he hopes to keep his magazine afloat financially, he is offered something that he can't refuse - a large paycheck for twelve months of work on one project. The project? To try to discover who killed a teenage girl living on a family estate. The wealthy corporate uncle of the teenage girl wants answers and the answers may still lie on the family's estate where many of the family members still live.<br /><br />The journalist (Blomkvist) is soon joined by a computer hacker with tattoos, dark makeup and a trouble history. Still, she seems to be able to find out information when nobody else can and the two team up to solve a mystery.<br /><br />The book is somewhat slow at first, but don't give up. It gets wild and the family (The Vanger Family) will show its ugly side over and over as the journalist begins probing too deep into the family's past. It's a disturbing book at times and a fascinating read that will keep you engaged until the mystery is solved. I thought the book went a bit long with another plot twist at the end regarding another Swedish Corporate giant, but it's worth the time to read this great thriller. Apparently, he wrote three books before his untimely death and I hope the other two books are this great!
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis was one of the coolest men of our time.  This was Davis' third collaboration with Gil Evans and was recorded towards the end of 1959, and this music is both original and remarkably conspicuous.  \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\" is the centrepiece around which the whole album was created, and it sucks you in right from the start.  This version also includes a bonus track called \\"Song for Our Country\\" and another two-track run-through of \\"Concierto\\", which blends jazz and classical in such a way that it reaches surrealistic heights of near musical perfection.  I've never been to Spain, but this incredibly rich music has me considering planning my next vacation there.

Also the satire of 'Baby Your A Rich Man' is genius, and should be noted as such. While George only has one real original in the eerie but fantastically so, 'Blue Jay Way' (which is beyond underrated) and in the great instrumental 'Flying.' Ringo just really goes through the motions here but it doesn't weight the album down. While I am not a big fan of McCartney he does contribute quite a bit here. 'Penny Lane' and 'Hello Goodbye' both of which I could take or leave but are none the less bonafide Beatle classics. 'Your Mother Should Know' is sort of grandma, and sort of novelty but feels nice and at home on this freak out of an album. 'The Fool On The Hill' is really where he succeeds through. It is his crowning achievement as a song writer. Sheer pop brilliance. While on the other hand, there is no redeemable quality to the title track, it plays like a joke.<br /><br />While it may not be as widely recognized as Srg. Pepper, it honestly plays all the way through more solid, and feels like more of an album than that of Pepper, and for that I must rate Magical Mystery Tour a five star album.
6304712936|5.0|Even though I typically only watch The Director's Cut of this film, this version is still good to have.  For one, it's the original theatrical cut of the movie that was released back in 1984, second, it has a feature that the two-disc director's cut does not have: an optional isolated music-only track that plays along with the film.  It's great because it features music that has never been included on any of the various soundtrack album permutations that have been released over the years.    Now, if Warner Bros. would just hurry up and blu-ray this sucker, everything will be good.

B001C3KCSY|4.0|This latest effort from KoL knocked me for a loop on my first listen.  I was immediately disheartened, disoriented, and generally disappointed by the focus on 'gentleness'.  It seemed so mellow, and so informed by narcotic psychedelia that I just felt underwhelmed.  But having been so enchanted by \\"Because of the Times\\" - I insisted on listening again to the music of this new album.      I absolutely love the first three tracks, and absolutely admire the closing three tracks.  In particular, \\"Be Somebody\\" truly amazes me.  \\"I Want You\\" is also a great groove tune.    This is the sort of album that you play - you lay back and just lose yourself in the beats, melodies, and grooves.      Yes - it's a far less raucous album, it lacks the bombast and swagger of the prior albums.  However - don't let that fool you -- it packs a punch nonetheless - it has impact, and it will move you.  You have to let it.  Truly concentrate, and you'll feel the impact, and then I defy you to tell me that this album ain't heavy.

0441172717|2.0|Don't get me wrong, i LOVE love love DUNE, but this is a review for this edition.  As a rather thick soft cover book i have to manually hold the book open while i'm reading.  Sounds like a dumb complaint, except that when you put your fingers on the text the ink smears.  The pages are some kind of smooth newsprint-like paper.  This isn't a big problem if you only read the book once i guess (although once you get to the right hand page there might be a big ol' thumb print on it) but i think that you will want to read it again and again.  Maybe my hands are extra sweaty or i just had a bum copy or something but i have NEVER had this problem before, and i've read the next five books in the series as well, the paper is different.    I've read this book three times, and after noticing the problem the first time i have to hold the book open at the teeny little borders at the edge of the page, which really isn't fun.  When i'm reading this book i want to be able to concentrate on the spectacular world that is created for me in my mind and not on avoiding the text.    I suggest trying a different edition if you don't want thumb cramps and smeared words!

B0017MO10U|4.0|I thought \\"Continuum\\" was a nice continuation of the Stargate SG 1 franchise.  There was action, there were character moments, and there was drama.  Richard Dean Anderson's return appearances are always welcome, and while he didn't dominate the episode, he had more than just a token appearance.  This movie was a worthy addition to a dedicated fan's collection.

B0019X3ZZY|1.0|A friend of mine purchased this just about the same time that I had purchased CC's Vampyr, so we traded.  He filled me in and I read the reviews.  He also mentioned that I should read the enclosed book before watching.  So, I gahtered up my nerve to see what the fuss was all about and so I thought I had a pretty good idea of what I was in for. I wasn't even close.  A movie is for \\"entertainment\\" purposes...right?  I truly wonder how anyone could enjoy this movie.  I personally thought that this was terrible on so many levels.  I won't even do it justice by explaining why.  Oh, and by the way, don't leave this lying around the house with your other \\"Criterion Collection\\" DVDs.  If your kids other significant other finds this trash, you'll wish you had been caught with the Vivid Video year in review.  Buy Vampyr instead...

1878424602|5.0|As a child we are free of everything. But develop many beliefs and prejudices as we age. This book again gave me what I needed at the right moment. I would recommend it to anyone. Easy read.
055358202X|5.0|I read a few of the more negative reviews that were complaining about the lack of focus on the main characters.  I loved this book as much as any of the others, because it focused on some new and exciting characters.    to each his own I guess.    In any event...  GO BUY THIS WHOLE SERIES FOR THE LUV OF GAWD.  It is awesome.  I can't imagine any true fantasy nerd not reading this most holy of fantasy series.
B001CD6FKS|3.0|After 1999's \\"The Matrix\\", a landmark and all around awesome movie, the Wachowski Brothers...(siblings I should say, one's apparently a girl now) might've took a couple criticisms that the film was too action-y and centered on style so they tried to amp up the depth with the 2 Matrix sequels which was ironic that they were overindulgent in silly action sequences as well as pompous dialogue masquerading as quotes to be discussed in philosophy class. So when their follow-up was announced, a big-budget adaptation of the old \\"Speed Racer\\", you'd think they'd drop their tendency to look for seriousness when it wasn't required. Well, apparently not since Speed Racer is undoubtedly one of the flashiest movie released this year but it's also too long and attempting too hard at adding depth to the whole thing.    In the Racer family, being on the track is everything as elder brother Rex is practically a hero to everyone, notably his younger brother Speed. But after an accident claims Rex's life, Speed takes up the mantle and becomes quite a talented driver which attracts the attention of Royalton, a sponsor who's more concerned with money and the glamour than the racing itself. But when Speed declines the sponsorship contract, Royalton goes out of his way to get Speed off the track and with help from his family, his girlfriend Trixie and the mysterious Racer X, Speed will have to work hard to even survive the race, let alone win.    I think anyone who watches this film will most likely walk away feeling that the visuals and the look of the film were definately the highlight so I'll start with that first. Filmed mainly in front of green-screen a la Sin City and 300 (2 other visually impressive-yet-story-deficient films), this movie resembles one flying around on the nighttime Las Vegas casinos at 500 mph or to use an oft-used description, being the ball inside a pinball machine. If you wanted to convert your parents to Blu-Ray or you wanted to show why you spent all that money on your expensive Playstation 3, pop this disc in and cue to any one of the races.     It's the stuff in the middle that people will have problems with. While they don't pepper the film with topics about existence, choice, destiny and the like, the Wachowskis still wanted to make a movie that wasn't just about racing so we have characters chatting about sponsorship greed, corruption and the more honest and heartfelt family traditions. While it could be a thinly-veiled metaphor of the independent movie system versus the big studios, it's a bit unneeded and is discussed a bit too much. While we don't exactly want to see an hour-and-a-half of nothing but races, that doesn't mean we need scenes about villains scheming in the background and doing all but twirling their mustache or yelling \\"I'll get you, Gadget!\\"...wait, wrong cartoon.    Unless you were a diehard fan of it in theatres, I suggest renting just in case. If you're one of those types like me that don't want a library full of home theater showoffs and want an actual movie, don't bother and just test the waters but if you're a fan, by all means, go for it.
B000Y9PILI|5.0|Nash and his team did a superb job of remixing (NOT re-recording) and resurrecting this record. This one's right up there with the IICORMN Crosby remix. What makes this package especially great is that not only is there a fantastic surround mix, but great care was taken to remix the stereo mix, mastered by the great Doug Sax. Phil Lesh's bass sounds amazing! So if you aren't able to listen in 5:1, it's still well worth picking up. Unfortunately I downloaded the older version on i-tunes a few months back. Loading in this new version and a/b-ing them, it's no contest. Take it from someone who purchased the original vinyl version back in the day, the songs and the sound of this album ranks as the very best of CSN and even Y.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|I may have a more objective review than most here as I was not a major Priest fan growing up in the 80's. I did hear their popular songs and loved them, but did not relish in their albums. I was always drawn to conceptual rock like Rush 2112, The Who's Tommy and Quadrophenia. So to hear an amazing rock opera like this in 2008 is refreshing and brave.    I for one would finance bringing this to the stage. I think it would be a sell out show instantly and it would be well deserved. I do not think Priest fans should fear this variance of Priest. Have we (40 and 50 something folk) all not mellowed after all the years of rocking hard. I think our generation is far deeper than the current crowd and can appreciate change and taking risks.     So I applaud Priest and I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because nothing is perfect - although a new Zeppelin album and tour may just be that.    Rock on Priest. And great vocals Rob!!
0446402389|3.0|This is a wonderful first novel.  The setting of Stalinist Russia is very well conveyed throughout; the tone and characters very much like the writings of Solzhenitzyn.  The crimes are horrible, of course, and the chapter dealing with the luring and murder of the small boy who is collecting stamps is memorable.  There are a few irritations with the novel:  the characters come off rather flat, one-dimensional.  We never really understand emotions because they are never fully explored; Leo and Raisa's relationship is central to the story but it is never developed.  Also, the dialog sounds in many places like a very stilted translation from Russian.  I am sure that in future novels Mr. Smith will work through these two things and be providing more intriguing stories like \\"Child 44\\" in the future.
B000GRTQXY|5.0|The negatives that dog this band always amaze me. (See the 'official' Amazon review on this page, for an example.) Anything but the most casual listen would confirm that Primal Scream are without doubt THE hottest, most butt-kicking rock band in the world today. And Riot City Blues is possibly their strongest effort to date.    Perception is everything. Some people still think PS sold out when they stopped being punk. Or that they were too laid-back in their Screamadelica psychedelic period. Or that they cloned the Stones with Give Out But Don't Give Up. Cloned??? They made those aging gasbags look like the pathetic has-beens they really are. The Stones only WISH they could sound this fresh, hot and downright clever.    When it comes to Riot City Blues, many listeners will be deceived by the extra-loud heavy-metal sound. But just stop and read through all the lyrics. These are amazingly intelligent songs. Some, like the deceptively bouncy Country Girl and the more overt 99th Floor tend towards the cynical. But this isn't just nihilism; it's intelligent comment. Poetry, even. And always redeemed by incredibly soulful singing from Gillespie and infectiously melodic composition. Not to mention a deep-down integrity; these guys are singing to please themselves, not to net a bigger paycheck, or to please some music-industry dweeb.    If I had to list the most important albums of the 21st Century so far, Riot City Blues would be very high on the list. And if I were listing the most important bands (not to mention the most under-appreciated by snooty, pretentious critics, who can't really remember what rock 'n' roll was all about), Primal Scream would be a strong contender for top spot.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Absolutely superb restoration - compared to the previous version the images have come to life, creating a whole different cinematic experience. The new sound is also very impressive. This is a must-buy.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I'd rate Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" as far as the song writing, lyrics and musical ideas at 4.  In fact it COULD have been one of their better albums.  But I have to rate the production, mixing, and \\"pressing\\" of the CDs at a dismal 2.  Therefore an over all rating of 3.  Like everyone else (that can hear) I hear (with my 54 year-old ears) excessive compression and a load of clipping!  Others have discussed this in detail so I will not go into the technical details.    Since I was not happy with the sound upon my first listen to the album with small headphones on my LapTop's CD-ROM / DVD Drive I figured that I would wait until listening to the album a second time with my stereo system through my big speakers, and with my wife to get a second opinion before passing judgement.  Still sounds like distorted c**p.  The next day I returned to the store and purchased the vinyl 2LP version of Death Magnetic to see if the \\"analog mix\\" on the LP would be better.  It turns out it is.  There is less distortion and less clipping.  And certainly not so overly loud (excessive amplitude on the tracks).  You can actually hear the drums, hi-hat, and cymbals.  It still has an odd sound to it.  Overall the LP sounds slightly flat.  The flatness may be correctable and might just be my imagination due to the excessive difference in dynamic range between the CD and LP versions.  Also I have a new receiver and I may need to adjust the treble and bass on it and the cross-over L-pads on my speakers.  Buttom line, if you don't want to go crazy with this album, go retro and buy the LP.  Yes, this album should be remastered (if the raw DAT tapes are not clipped too).
B00000IL67|5.0|I am in agreement with those who conclude that this is more for the fans of Alice solo than the fans of the original band. The track list reads more like a best of collection than a comprehensive set containing everything he ever did. The majority of AC fans at least as I know them are more concerned with the early AC years when ACG was a major concert draw. This is the period from Love it To Death, Killer, School's Out, Billion Dollar Babies and Muscle of Love. The first 2 albums produced for Frank Zappa's label are rarely mentioned amongst orignal ACG fans because there are no hits from either of those and also, truth be knownst, they are really bad albums that border on being unlistenable, sloppy,  recordings of second rate Pink Floyd imitations that are just plain boring and directionless. Not until Love it To Death does ACG find a hit as well as their distinctive sound largely thanks to Bob Ezrin. The first 2 albums have their moments of what you might call curious interest, like playing your guitar out of tune might give you an interesting sound, but are largely unworthy of time, money or comment. Alice's solo career presents the idea that the Coop grew up and out of whatever possessed him in the first place, settled down, married and now views the onstage and offstage Alice as 2 entirely different people, and has a sense of humor about his image as it were, including his age. All very well and good but the most interesting part of ACG was the original band which is summarized here as well as the solo albums. For fans of the original band who don't want to spend money on the number of god awful solo albums he's produced, but rather prefer a comprehensive overview of the solo albums best moments and the best known cuts from the originals, this is for you. What would be nice would be 2 seperate box sets, one from each era.
B00168HARG|5.0|I did not see the first season on TV but had seen the pilot when it was reshown and it interested me enough to see what I had missed, so when the disks came out I ordered them and I am glad I did.    This is a very entertaining series at least as good as the movies and better than most shows on TV today.    If you liked the movies or just a good entertaining series, with good plot line, interesting characters and just plain good watching. Get this.
B0011UCOGG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this third installment of the Inheritance Cycle. It had action, drama, and moved the storyline along enough to keep you turning pages. My only criticism is that the book did not seem to have an over-arching plot. It moved the story along to where it needed to be, but it at times left you wondering what was going on. It could also be considered a strength, however, as the lack of focused direction made me feel like I was experiencing the world as Eragon or Roran would day to day. I thoroughly recommend this book to all who have enjoyed Eragon and Eldest.
0060574216|1.0|Before you buy this book and before you start applying these principles to your life, you have a right to know about John Gray's qualifications. Both his bachelors and masters degrees were awarded by a farcical unaccredited \\"school\\" run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, which is difficult to pin down, but rumored to have consisted of a few desks in a hotel in Seelisberg, Switzerland. His PHD was \\"earned\\" from Columbia Pacific University, a mail-order diploma mill that was shut down by the California attorney general. I'm not saying that his ideas are all worthless; I've read the book and there do seem to be a few common sense pointers. I'm just saying approach with caution, because Mr. Gray seems to have a huge credibility gap, as far as I am concerned.
0805079831|1.0|I've never read more bass ackward analysis and perceptions of neoliberalism, austrian economics, and capitalism.    Her completely fictitious \\"doctrine\\" of shocking people into change can only be applied to a bear minimum of scenarios.  9/11 begot the Patriot Act, the Great Depression begot social welfare, Enron begot Sabines-Oxley, record gas begot the Energy Independence and Security Act, mortgage and lender failures begot a series of bailouts.  For each of her cases in which deregulation occurred in the wake of a disaster, I can name five cases that were quite the opposite.  I've heard stronger arguments in favor of Scientology.    Her demonization of Milton Friedman should also be considered criminal.  Not one of his quotes was used in its original context.  Anyone who has read a book by Milton Friedman knows he is quite the opposite of a neo-conservative and he despises corporatism as much as socialism.  His supposed admission to this \\"shock doctrine\\" is also interpreted entirely the wrong way.  He believed that government control is an inevitable failure and that crisis would hopefully lead to a free market solution, not another government program.  To think that people like George Bush and General Pinochet keep a copy of [[ASIN:0156334607 Free to Choose: A Personal Statement]] on their nightstand is ludicrous.  Tyranny and capitalism do not go hand-in-hand.    I urge anyone who reads this book (and everyone who doesn't) to pick up ANY Milton Friedman book and you'll see he does not subscribe to this fictional \\"shock doctrine\\".
B000026D42|3.0|To me there is no bad APP album. Peaks and troughs, yes, with some retreads, and when \\"Project\\" disappears from their covers in my view the albums actually improve, though I agree with one reviewer who says it's truly not a Project or otherwise without lead guitarist Ian Bairnson.    The music and seamless production notwithstanding, each APP album from I Robot to perhaps Vulture Culture did not just follow its own distinct theme but also told me a story, not so much a hidden message or sub-text, at times quite oblique and not delivered in completely linear fashion, yet meriting repeated listening and perhaps even study. Most APP \\"album stories\\" had a science fiction or otherwise speculative tone that readily appealed, and Eric Woolfson's later forays into stage musicals proved him eminently capable of writing a libretto on his chosen subject.    At first blush Eve was the true puzzler. Thinking its songs misogynistic was charitable, and the album artwork didn't help, though before long I realized the lyrical sword did swing both ways. Some tunes were catchy enough for Top 40 and FM play, but on the whole the men's singing voices were pitched typically high yet atypically shrill, with one lead reminding me far too much of Gary Lewis, and the to-date unprecedented female leads unrecognizable Stateside, all of which I suppose was intended.    Here's the album story for Eve I'd like to think was intended, borrowing most from H. G. Wells's In The Days Of The Comet and Philip Wylie's The Disappearance:    \\"Lucifer\\" introduces a cataclysmic event befalling Earth, possibly man-made, possibly extraterrestrial (unlike Eye In The Sky, which involves a visitor). The repeating Morse Code before the martial crescendo spells \\"EVE.\\" What happens to the planet is anyone's guess but likely isn't pleasant. However, that event also triggers a biological change in the male-female relationship, perhaps granting only the distaff side enhanced perception or, if you will and in the true sci-fi vein, \\"psionic\\" powers on par with one of my favorite sci-fi characters, James H. Schmitz's Telzey Amberdon. And, just as likely, placing every male on a dead-end street.    \\"You Lie Down With Dogs\\" and \\"I'd Rather Be A Man\\" are tales of making do in the immediate aftermath. Try to figure out which side is represented in either, and if you can't you're entitled to a little disorientation. (A one-sentence homage to I Robot ends the latter.) With \\"You Won't Be There,\\" \\"Winding Me Up\\" and \\"Damned If I Do\\" you get an exaggerated viewpoint of the male's realization that his mate is either profoundly distracted (\\"Why must our love be something in the air?\\") or unhealthily attracted but in any event markedly altered.    \\"Don't Hold Back\\" is one enhanced woman's plea for the unenhanced to enter the \\"Secret Garden\\" she and doubtless others have found, while \\"If I Could Change Your Mind\\" is another and more nostalgic woman's lament that it just won't happen. Nice touch at the latter's end with a cathedral organ, and with that, study the album artwork, front, then back.    Is it all an allegory of the original Downfall? To paraphrase Joe Haldeman, you pay your money and you take your frame of reference. But I've always liked a good story, and to have one appear on a progressive rock album that encourages me to figure it out if not make it up as I go along doubles the pleasure.
0143038419|1.0|If Woody Allen and Saul Bellow had a baby who inherited most of her parents' neuroses and love of self-analysis and very little of their talent, that baby would be Elizabeth Gilbert.  Gilbert's writing style is okay.  She was amusing at times and I found parts of her descriptions of her stay in India interesting.  But I just couldn't get past the author's jaw-dropping obsession with herself.  She simply isn't interesting enough to warrant it!  I was pretty sick of her after about forty pages.  Why do Oprah-ites think the way to \\"find yourself\\" is to spend 365 days thinking about yourself and nothing but yourself?  Most of us in the real world know the true path to self-enlightenment comes thru \\"losing yourself.\\"
B000099T2L|5.0|I love this cd. This is my favorite cd by Beyonce. Some say that the first 3 songs are the only worthy ones on here. I disagree you have to give it a chance and really listen to the whole album. When I first heard it I thought it was just o.k.. But the more I listened to it the more I fell in love with it. The hit songs to me were not the best ones on the c.d. The lesser know hits were better than the hits. She's an o.k. artist to me, but I fell in love with this c.d. out of all her others. The only song I didn't care for to much was Hip Hop Star. I even fell in love with Daddy, which I didn't care for to much, but it is a beautiful song the more I listened to it. What a beautiful tribute to our fathers.
0307269752|4.0|I am a bit of two minds about this book. On one hand I thoroughly enjoyed the greater part of the book which deals with the disappearance and possible death of Harriet Vanger, \\"a young scion of one of the wealthiest families in Sweden.\\" The author crafts an excellent mystery while also making a statement about societies tacit acceptance of certain types of violence toward women. (The story is based in Sweden but sadly resonant the world over.) The storyline is compelling and well executed. A secondary plot line involving a libel judgment and corporate malfeasance is less successful.<br /><br />The book starts slowly and it is ever-so-tempting to give up on it before the plot really takes off. Only the generally positive reviews and assurances that I would be rewarded for my efforts kept me plugging along. Once the story got moving, the book was hard to put down. It was a compelling read right up to the conclusion of the heiress saga. Then the author turned his attention back to the secondary plot line which involved corporate fraud, computer hacking, investigative journalism, journalistic standards etc. It could be just my lack of interest in those subjects or the fact that I did not personally care for the journalist, but I thought this plot line dragged the book down.<br /><br />Mr. Larsson's characters are a hit. the male protagonist of this story is compellingly repellent. He is a gifted investigator and a principled scribe, he is also a faithless lover, a negligent father and a sexual opportunist. The female lead is more sympathetic but no less \\"well rounded\\". On a macro level she has difficulty functioning in society. She is antisocial in the extreme and like a frightened abused animal strikes out when threatened, often to her detriment. On a micro level, she is absolutely brilliant in her sphere of expertise - computer hacking and personal investigations. At certain points in the story her level of social incompetence does seem to conveniently recede, but the slippage is almost required to keep the pace of the story moving along. Secondary characters are similarly satisfyingly complex.<br /><br />Overall a really good book with a strong social message. But for the secondary plot line I would have given it 5 stars.almost required to keep the pace of the story moving along. Secondary characters are similarly satisfyingly complex.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I had just about given up hope after the awful \\"St. Anger\\" that Metallica could ever put out another good album.  So when I saw they had a new album coming out this year I didn't have any real expectations.  But wow!  \\"Death Magnetic\\" kicks.  My favorite Metallica album is \\"Master of Puppets\\" and unlike alot of the long time fans of the band I was never enamored with \\"Justice\\".  It seemed too self-indulgent with songs that went nowhere, especially the second half of the album, and the production was probably the worst I have ever heard.  \\"Death Magnetic\\" is what \\"Justice\\" should have been.  It's like a cross between \\"Justice\\" and the \\"Black Album\\".  Long, progressive songs (Justice) that are more accesible (Black Album) than those on \\"Justice\\". The best tracks are \\"End of The Line\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\", \\"Judas Kiss\\", \\"Broken...\\", \\"Cyanide\\" (I hear a riff from \\"Eye of The Beholder\\" on this track).  I wrote in my review for \\"Masters\\" that \\"Orion\\" has to be the best rock/metal instrumental ever.  Scratch that.  \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" blows that out of the water!  Unbelievable tune. Even though all the songs are in access of 5 minutes they don't ever seem to lose there direction like a number of the songs on \\"Justice\\" did.  On top of that the production, like the \\"Black Album\\", is a thousand times better.  I've read some of the reviews on here complaining about the production.  I don't know what they are talking about.  I did buy the CD and not the download, so maybe the download is where the complaints are coming from.      All in all this CD is a throwback to the old Metallica but also it combines the best aspects of Metallicas music through all of their phases.  I can even hear the best aspects of the \\"Load/Reload\\" era on tracks like \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" and \\"Unforgiven III\\".  Without a doubt this is not only the best Metallica album since \\"The Black Album\\" but should be mentioned as one of their best ever.
1416550518|5.0|Ms. Morton is a gifted storyteller. This is a gently paced, softly told story which takes place primarily in the decades surrounding the first world war. In this story a ninety eight year old grandmother, Grace, recollects the events of her youth. She tapes these recollections as a gift for her missing grandson.  As the story begins, we are on the cusp of the first world war. Grace enters into service at the great house, Riverton, where her mother was in service years before. (Grace has been assured by her mother that the family will accept her.) As the story progresses Grace becomes enthralled with the family, becoming particularly enamored with the eldest daughter of the Hartford family, Hannah.      On one level this story is a mystery, early in the story we are told that one night, in the midst of a family celebration, a young poet took his life in front of the two daughters of the home. One daughter was the poet's fiancee, the other his alleged lover. To this day no one knows exactly what happened to cause this tragedy, only that it destroyed the family forever.     On another level this is a story about the end of the Edwardian era of aristocratic privilege. This was a time when the role of women expanded, the class system came under attack and foundation of English society shifted.     The author deftly tells Grace's and England's story and what a wonderful story it is.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Will Smith's character thinks he's the last man in NYC after a devastating virus is unleashed.  His will and determination to exterminate the virus, while saving the people powers the film, even when he is the lone actor in the scenes.  It was interesting to see him handle so much time by himself.  I had been warned against this movie, but I'm glad I didn't listen because it was a pretty good movie.<br /><br />There were ultimately some scenes that I could have lived without, some scenes that made me cry, and some scenes that I thought were very cute.  It was interesting how a movie could combine so many different genres into one, and still maintain a simple plot line.<br /><br />I don't think it is an absolute must-see movie, but it is a movie that you should try to see if you get the opportunity.  You don't have to be a big sci-fi fan to get into it.  You just need to keep somewhat of an open-mind.

0375826726|1.0|After reading the first two of Paolini's books, I was very excited about this book. I thought that the first two books were interesting stories, and even if the writing was long winded, and borrowed too much from Star Wars, I was interested in seeing how the Inheritance \\"Trilogy\\" ended. After hacking my way through 600+ pages of filler, I discovered that ***SPOILERS*** Brom is Eragon's Father and that Eragon gets a new sword. A few chapters later on Glaidr and Oromis Die, and Paolini wedges in an awkward climax against a Shade, which starts and concludes in just over a page. Overall this book was entirely too long winded, and we spent most of the book forced to witness Eragon regret killing people, and wallowing in his own misery. Paolini also reduces Roran, who was one of the most compelling characters in Eldest, to a sideshow who can apparently do anything he wants simply because he has the force of will to. Paolini even lets Roran kill almost 200 soldiers in a row, while the rest of his forces sit back and watch. Even more aggravating than this is Paolini mentions in his Acknowledgments that \\"Because of its complexity, Brisingr ended up much larger than I anticipated- so much larger, in fact, that I had to expand the series from three books to four.\\" Given the amount of page space this book spends having Eragon fulfill oaths that the reader simply dosen't care about, one wonders if Paolini split up the books to make more money. This book is a waste of time and money. If you really still feel the need to read this book, do yourself a favor and check it out of a library or borrow it from someone who was unfortunate enough to buy it.

B001BGTWXI|5.0|with a band trying to become more popular?  Slipknot began as a band on the edge.  That is how most good bands start.  Then every band that is actually artistic begins to change and evolve.  To me, that is a good thing (Metallica anyone?).  Unfortunately, anyone who likes that band's first album is destined to hate it's latest.  That is what is happening here.  Some people cannot grow.  Those are the people that hate the new Slipknot album.  Personally I think it is a great, I mean GREAT, album!  I love thier progression...I like this one as much or more that I liked Verses, just like I loved Verses more than Iowa (OK, I didn't much care for Mate Feed Kill Repeat).  So, back to the future.  What is wrong with being able to understand the lyrics.  Corey is a fantastic lyricist and singer.  I WANT to be able to understand what he is singing about and trying to say through his music.  Just like Iowa was great for it's balls out thrash, Verses came right back with great melody and musicianship.  I think that they are just carrying that through with All Hope is Gone.  Again,  GREAT album!
B000A5044C|4.0|I remember reading about this in the newspaper for the interest it generated in the film festivals.  After having seen it I can see some of the appeal.  The kids are great actors and their struggle gets slowly worse as you see it unfold.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Disk #1 is all footage from her Las Vegas show...very nice...almost like being there.    Disk #2 is a \\"backstage pass\\", which documents what is going on backstage in \\"real time\\" (i.e. with a split screen, interviews with crew and dancers, etc).  It has some very funny footage on how Celine acts with her dancers, crew and \\"inner circle\\"...not like a diva, but like a real person with a sense of humor.    Highly recommend is you're a Celine Dion fan.

0061122416|5.0|This little book brought me joy it gave me an escape from the cluter of everyday life and allowed me to travel with the shephard boy. It is written beautifully and it flows so easily.  It is a must read. It gives you a wonderful read but it allows you to step back and breathe and put some perspective on your life, with the simple act of taking you out of the bustle of life for a little while.
B000G8NXYG|4.0|\\"Charming\\" is perhaps the last adjective one would expect to hear in connection with an old black-and-white samurai movie.  But at every turn, from Gorobei's jesting response to the initial test set for him by Kambei, to Kambei's joking at the expense of the freshly de-flowered Katsushiro before the final battle, this movie shows an easy, earthy, sense of humor.  This care, this willingness to psychologize each character, saves this movie from the pitfalls of most \\"battle epics.\\"      Yet, Kurosawa's technique is not less exalted in the action sequences.  If you are familiar with \\"Ran\\", or \\"Throne of Blood,\\" you are aware that he is the master of the big, wide-screen shot of massed cavalry advances.  In \\"Ran,\\" for instance, the battles outside of Hidetora's castle, with the washes of orange and pink, are masterful, painterly filmmaking.      Here, the battle scenes are of a more claustrophobic nature, and all the more dramatic, as a result.  The mounted bandits are shown vying at close quarters with the farmer pikemen in a grisly kaleidoscope of straining arms, tendons, hooves, spears, swords.  For those who would criticize the action sequences of \\"Seven Samurai,\\" the following question is in order:  which puts more of a demand on the imaginations -- the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" -- of its viewers?  A slick, cartoony CGI combat sequence (cf, \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"The Matrix\\", \\"The Hulk\\"), or sharp-focus photography of actual stuntmen simulating 16th-century combat?      Ultimately, Kurosawa is able to strike a perfect balance between breadth of vision, and sharpness of focus.  In doing so, he creates a full, but sharply-detailed universe for the action to unfold in.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Ever since the release of Serenity on HD-DVD, everyone and I mean everyone, have been anxiously awaiting this.  If you haven't seen this series yet, you're in for a treat. Joss Whedon created a once in a lifetime masterpiece.  Like all of us(Browncoats), you will watch the series and like Oliver you will be asking \\"more please\\".

0553805460|4.0|I actually worked for this company for about a month in the Bethesda, MD office in the summer of '93 and always swore the movie Boiler Room was modeled after this place.  The parking lot was a car show with Lamborghini's, Ferrari's, Porsche's, etc.  All they would talk about was the movie Wall Street.  I made $200 a week to make cold calls from first thing in the morning until 8 at night.  They wanted you to get 10 solid leads a day for your broker and they would close the deal after you qualified the client and found out how much they were working with in the market.  If they didn't have $100k then you basically hung up on them.  Really sad.  Wasn't my cup of tea and to actually find out it was most likely the story Boiler Room was based on is just so bizarre.  I would run into old coworkers and we would say the exact same thing about the irony between the movie and the company.  I am glad that I wasn't a part of it as I couldn't get a lead to save my life since I hate cold calling.
006112429X|5.0|Whew, I haven't quite finished this book and I'm writing the review because I've been discussing it with some friends. Mostly we agree, but I strongly disagree with one usually insightful friend who maintains that the author, Shriver, hates, yes HATES her characters!    This book isn't about hating your characters. It's about a boy who hates himself, was born hating himself, and his mother's effort to cope with that and her own self-knowledge and ultimate responsibility for her actions. Exactly what and how much is she responsible for in the monster she gave birth to and what part in all this does her husband take?     As I said, I'm not yet done with the book and I've come off a previous read that is much, much lighter fare, so this is difficult for me. I've stopped reading it at night, it's so intense.     If you want to try for many laughs, I've recommended a totally different subject--internet dating--in another review. [[ASIN:141969264X Middle-Age Confidential: My Life as a Date (This Could be a True Story)]],     If you can take the heavy novel--this is my first Shriver read--I say try this one.

0486424545|5.0|Who will inherit England?  While Forster's Howard End does not exactly answer this question, it sets out the possibilities.  This superbly crafted novel is quite relevant today:  how do the actions of the individual citizens of the world's greatest superpower influence the destiny of that nation?  For the turn of the century England of Howards End, it is about Empire and money and its corrosive influence on tradition and personal morality; and Forester sets up the house, Howards End, as the curious symbol of England in a transition from an uneasy present to an uncertain future.  Characters from different social and economic strata subtly, cunningly, even sub-consciously, compete for ownership of the house.  For Forester, Howards End, with its elm tree with pig teeth embedded in the trunk (used by peasants in a former age as a balm for tooth aches) becomes a new type of mythology for England.  For a nation radically transformed, and set for yet more change, the house becomes a fixed point, a vestige of an agrarian past which may be set for a rebirth
B00005JPS8|5.0|I'm biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had.<br /><br />The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though it's an FX driven film, it's not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said, the FX are INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT it's AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season one was a treat, but season two packs a greater impact on the viewer.  There is more tension in the episodes and leaves you wanting for more to see what's gonna happen ... Can't wait for Season Three.  The series is a phenomenon!
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|For all of you that think slipknot has ever put out a bad disc...poo on you!

B001CD6FKI|3.0|\\"Speed Racer\\" was a disappointment until I critiqued it on it's own merit. In doing so, the film was good, but the storyline, just as in the animated series, is child-simple.     The special effects were numerous and well-done, a virtual vertigo inducing dizzfest for those not spatially oriented!! The Mach 5 underwent some strange changes, and the Mach 6 was a good looking machine.    I have only these gripes and observances:    I don't like Emile Hirsch's acting style, and he did a bad job of convincing ME that he was Speed Racer, all-out mega-racer, and all-around good guy.    Finally! We get to see what Mom Racer looks like!    Trixie! How times have changed! You used to be tall and lanky. Now you're short and dumpy.....What happened?!    Sparky speaks with an Australian accent? Since when?!    Spritle and Chim-Chim could have been deleted from the story, and no one would have noticed.    Racer X is NOT Speed's older brother? Oh, face change....Racer X isn't Speed's older brother?! Political intrigue.......Racer X isn't Speed's older brother?!    Lastly, the film was too long for the storyline. it could have been done in an hour.    My son, who was an avid Speed Racer fan (he would race home after school to watch Speed do his thing), says he didn't like it, because it strayed way too far from the animated series he knows so well. Since I don't have that kind of history with Speed Racer, I can only comment on the film I saw. It was good, but not worth a four or five star rating.
0345494997|1.0|I hated this book for so many reasons; I'm not certain where to begin.      I suppose I can start with the premise.  Well educated, well read mother and wife, feels she's not living up to her potential; not living authentically; feels there's more out there; wants to discover who she is.  This premise has been examined countless times and I'm confident today there are many educated, well read mothers (particularly stay at home moms) and wives that have experienced those same feelings.  However most of us do not fall into an affair with a lying egoist (okay, so he's considered a genius) and proceed to abandon our children under the guise of having to find out who we really are.  Mamah's story would have been more captivating had she struck out on her own as opposed to taking up with another man and a married man at that.  The story would have also seemed more credible, had her husband been stifling in some way.  He was depicted as being nothing but encouraging.    Second, I could barely stomach Mamah's deference to FLW regarding her translation of a poem.  There she is a woman with a master's degree in languages; an experienced translator and she's asking the architect, what he thinks.    Mamah's surprise at how she was depicted in the press was the point at which my expectations for this book plummeted.  A woman of that time would have known exactly what she was in for.  There would have been no doubt she would be painted with a \\"scarlet letter\\" and become a social pariah.  Her curling up in bed with her bottle of cough syrup with just stupid.    Unfortunately once I begin a book I have to finish it.  I pushed on just to get it read since it is our book club selection for this month.  I wish I hadn't.  Did Horan's publisher say \\"hey, you have to wrap this up\\" because the ending of this book came out of nowhere.  All of a sudden (within a few pages) there's racial conflict between employee's, a dismissal and then the dismissed party goes crazy and kills several people.  Is it just me, or was some character/scene development warranted there?    Finally, historical fiction is tough and I would think the first thing an author has to do is be firmly planted in the era about which they write. That wasn't the case here.  The main character seemed naive about the time in which she lived and at times seemed to \\"think\\" with the mind of a 21st century woman.    Obviously I was very disappointed.  I would suggest taking a pass on this one.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|I have about everything Eric Clapton has recorded and some of my favorite songs are on this CD. This is a more laid-back, reflective Clapton, similar to his Pilgrim, Reptile, and Unplugged CDs. It reflects the \\"other\\" EC that some of his long-time fans (like me) treasure, along with his Blues CD's. There's not as much sizzling guitar here (although you might check out \\"One Day\\" to hear the master playing Blues guitar as good as it gets), but there's a lot more DEPTH. Perhap it's because I've heard \\"After Midnight\\", \\"Cocaine\\", \\"Layla\\", etc. about 100 times more than I needed to, or perhaps it's because I'm about his age and and past needing adrenalin rushes, but I LIKE this Eric Clapton A LOT. He's more subtle, thoughtful, and \\"blues-y\\". He's more of the ensemble musician he always wanted to be. EC grew up. Deal with it!
0596101996|5.0|This is the book all the JS rockstars out there tend to recommend to people. I don't think it's for everybody personally. It's very thorough and explains JS and its various incarnations at a high level of intricacy that I wouldn't recommend to beginners who are easily distracted (i.e. more heavily creative-brained designers). I'm fairly evenly brained myself and I occasionally found myself zombie-reading as exciting as some of the specifics are too me.    On the other hand, if you want to know just about everything there is to possibly know about JS, this is the book. And that's worth five stars to me.    A good place to get a start with JS if you've never programmed is a decent class or self-teaching the basics online. Then I recommend Jeremy Keith's DOM scripting. Then the Complete Reference. Then this bruiser when you really want get in deep.

B000002J0P|5.0|There are so many classic songs on this album, how does one pick a favorite?  If you have vaguely heard of these guys, PICK THIS UP!!  This is how music is supposed to be done.  There is NO ONE who sounds as good as these guys.  If you are under 30 and expecting hard/heavy rock, you won't find it here.  Probably the contemporary type for these guys is alternative rock.  These guys sing and harmonize on a completely different level from anyone else.  Basically, you take 3 people from 3 separate bands and turn them into a supergroup.  That is CSN.  This just plain rocks.

0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki made up the character \\"Rich Dad\\", he never existed period.     Kiyosaki is a failed businessowner who excels is lying and exploiting peoples dreams of becoming rich.    This book WON'T make you rich, it contains no guides on how to become rich, just general advice that's been around for decades.    His advice to speculate on real estate may very well been the cause of the financial crisis US is currently in, Kiyosaki effectively fueled the housing bubble the taxpayers are now paying for in trillions of dollars.     This book is so irresponsible, wrong and full of lies that it sickens me. If you want someone to blame for all those foreclosures and subprime disasters, Kiyosaki is your best bet.
0763619612|1.0|This book was read at back-to-school night at Rosendale Elementary by the newly hired principal. The book celebrates mediocrity by framing in gold a half-hearted splotch of ink... once the teacher set such a low bar, the child thinks \\"I've got talent\\" and proceeds to create large quantities of mediocrity.<br />It's all part of the dumbing down of quality and a feel-good educational system that rewards the smallest of effort.
0375826726|4.0|I had anxiously awaited this book for a while, and I'm glad to have read it. It is not a disappointment as some have said. I definitely do not think it was my favorite of the series, but as with any series there is always one story that has to be the worst. With that said I want to say that though there were some slow parts that could have been shorter, but any extra time I had I read the book, and there are few I will do that with. I kept on reading because I knew there was more to come and I wanted to find out what that was.     Some have said the book was drawn out and that it may be, don't some believe the seventh Harry Potter book was? But do you see it with 3 1/2 stars not it has 4 1/2 stars. Was wandering around in there tents so different from following oaths you have to uphold? I think not.    Other reviews have pointed out the likeness of Brisingr and the rest of the Inheritance cycle to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. But as with any story especially good vs. evil there are always similarities, because I believe that nothing is truly original. Again as with Harry Potter some believed it to be very like the Chronicles of Narnia or Lord of the Rings.    Another thing is the criticism of the way and how much they talk. Personally I believe this to be based in a sort of Medieval society so they do talk a little different than us today. Secondly I believe that I would rather have more conversing than describing every little detail as some books do. Brisingr does not go overly into detail describing the setting, it gives enough so that you can get a good picture in your head.    Altogether Brisingr may have it's faults but I believe that those faults are made up by the end and the other very suspenseful parts that had me biting my nails. I believe this book to have been necessary to fully develop more of the story, making a fourth book needed. I will say I enjoyed the first two books far more, but I look forward to rereading the series. Brisingr may be a little long winded but if you have not read it or the series I highly encourage you to do so.
0439023483|5.0|Collins writes a story that you on the edge of your seat at the last sentence of Chapter 1!  Being a mom of four daughters this book completely tugged at my heart strings and so easily put their faces on a few characters in this story.  Very emotional and you can see every frame as if you are watching the games right along with the audience of The Hunger Games.  I will definitely be looking for Book 2 of this series! Well done!!!!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the storybook ending, just as others reviewers have said. Unlike the majority though I absolutely loved it! I didn't want any of the characters to be unhappy in the ending, and I got what I wanted, which was perfectly fine with me. It may have been a disappointment to some people but it was perfect for me. So I highly recommend this book, but I just wish there was more.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|The restoration is perfect. The Godfather is a cherished film not a window of mob life. I was looking forward to the clear and sharp window like picture of today's blu-ray's. But as I watched The Godfather I realised this is the perfect picture for the movie. Most of all the colors pop with such a variety of dark colors and the blacks are real blacks and not the gray's with alot of noise in the dvd collection. I laughed when I saw the Mo Green hit. Me and my friend always made fun of it and now it is a brutal execution. Before it was a watery light pink that ran from his eye. Now it is darkened and even seems to have a thicker texture to it. The audio is crisp and keeps the original mostly front channel sound. The whole perpus of the restoration is not to make it the perfect picture, but to make it the perfect viewing exerience of the Godfather. And even though its not as sharp as the current blu-rays it is a vast improvement. Any True Godfather fan will make the upgrade.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|Yes, this set features, as other fellow commentators have remarked in their notes to it, most of the luminaries of Wagner singing in the aftermath of the 1939-1945 european war (with many of them starting their careers in the years immediately preceeding it, or during it) and in their absolute prime. It may also be taken as a truthful and treasurable sound documentary of the Festival's post-war glories that puts to shame its current state of affairs (and now more than ever, as it formally passed to the hands of Wolfgang's daughters, if the very questionable Meistersinger staged by Katharina Wagner in recent years is a sample of what she has in store for the coming years). But to my opinion, this set is a must for people interested in getting to know what conducting Wagner is about, wanting to get into the four-part work's guts, its very bare bone marrow.    This year 2008 marks Keilberth's 100th brithday, as it also marks Karajan's. And the approach to Der Ring from both conductors cannot differ further than it does as evidenced from this set (and Karajan himself had conducted the Ring at Bayreuth a handful of years before). For if to many Karajan's work will be a magnet for its romantic approach, beauty of sound and general musicianship, Keilberth aimed directly and mercilessly, as I said above, at the work's very bare soul. For what this live recording shows above all is a solid long-range conception and vision, little impaired by isolated episodes and always within a solid perspective of the wood rather than isolated trees, with a continuous sense of line and sense of direction. Romantic? Yes. Purposeful? Mostly so. Passionate? Always. In fact, it might be said that this might well be one of the most passionate Wagner renditions on record, Furtwängler's included. If you wanted to encapsulate Keilberth's end result in a nutshell, you might have to choose the word \\"passion\\".    The sound (stereo, a curiosity and mostly a sound engineers' toy back in 1955) as captured by Decca's engineers truthfully capture the theatre's particular accoustics, yet slightly favouring the voices. The qualities and orchestral playing practices still in use in the Germany of the 1950's stand out also in favour of the set, for those who are curious about old orchestral playing styles in today's globalised and homogenised world. Nobody plays like that today, even in Germany, any more than anybody today conducts Wagner like that either. No plea this for living in the past, but none the less a lesson for conductors today toying with the idea of getting into a theatre pit and tackling the Ring.

A friend of mine burned this for me and it only took me one listen to know that I had to buy it for myself.  It reminded me of the good old days, you know when rock was rock nothing fancy just good music.  Runnin' wild--Too much, Too young, Too fast--What's eatin' you, just to name a few are fantastic songs that I can't get out of my head.  Sure you could compare them to AC/DC but there not they are Airbourne which is a great thing!
6304711905|5.0|In my humble opinion, Tombstone is one of the best westerns made.  I wasn't looking for a history lesson, I can watch the history channel for that.  I was looking for movie entertainment at it's hyperbolic best.  Every character; the good, the bad, the ugly are over the top.  This movie is fun.  I watched Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp and was continually yawning.  I loved the portrayal of Curly Bill in Tombstone, just capital. Ringo is intellectually maniacal.  And dear Ike, as dufus as he is, he's practical.  This is western mythology and story telling at its best.  A factual history lesson, no; a grand cinematic yarn, resoundingly, yes!  (30May2010)  This movie gets better everytime I watch it!
0143038419|1.0|I truly can't understand what the excitement was all about with this book. This book is full of self absorbed drivel where the author carried on, and on, and on... about the demise of her marriage throughout the entire novel. I couldn't sympathise with her as the break up didn't appear to be that bad.  I felt embarassed for her in the way she carried on about herself as though it was the worst thing in the world when outside the ashram in India was total poverty. Honestly don't waste your time or money on this drivel.
B00003CXBH|5.0|A film that comes from so far away 22 years ago that the story, or the history, of the film is no longer important, but was it important even in 1986? Today the struggle between the two Christian kings of Portugal and of Spain on one hand, though hostile to each other when the other party is absent, and the church on the other hand, a church that is also divided between the European hierarchy that only sees the survival they have to go through in Europe by defending there their interests by sacrificing a few missions in South America. Today these details are irrelevant  The Christian church or churches have long abandoned this kind of policy, particularly the Catholic church. But today the general pattern of the story, the massacre, the slaughter, the slaying of a whole Indian, local population to the sole interest of the colonial powers who try to put their hands on the riches and resources of some foreign countries, like oil in Iraq for instance is quite a familiar story. And what about that American war hero who became an American war hero in a war that killed several million people and devastated a whole country for the sole political and economic interests of one country, one country alone. Who cares in the west about the local indigenous population that gets killed by western bullets? Like The Sons of The Pioneers used to sing, \\"Lie Low, Little Doggies, Lie Low on the Ground\\". We are living in a world that stands upside down in two ways. It is still standing upside down if we consider normal human ethics that tells us to help the poor and the weak and to respect the goods and property of other people, particularly their national territory. And yet that world that is upside down is in the process of tilting over and then getting upside down a second time, which might bring it upside up and downside down. The champion of deregulated free market jungle economy is nationalizing most of the American banking system and is getting ready to do the same with the car industry that has been playing with bankruptcy for quite a few years now. Less state he says the candidate of the party of this president. Yet this president nationalizes all that is getting into difficult straits by their own fault, but he does not forget that public money is the property of the rich since they did not contribute much and he is trying to give them a financial bonanza for their dumb incompetence. You see the pattern. That pattern that is still alive like hell and kicking like a dumb mule. Don't worry, as usual, before the world gets back to upright many people will be killed and will die. Before Brazil got a president that is starting the reversal of that historical injustice and mistake of 1750, quite a few millions were killed or enslaved or tortured or assassinated or whatever provided death was the end of it. But this film gives you another element of that pattern. The powerful who plan to genocide you manage to present the whole matter in such a way that you have to agree to foot the bill which will hurt you or otherwise the depression that would ensue would not only hurt, it would bring humanity a few hundred million individuals down, lower and shorter. And in the back of their heads they believe that this is sustainable since for at least twenty or thirty years the overpopulation of the world will be slowed down. As these vultures would say: there is always a positive point in any negative event. But the more I try to think positively the more I stand on the side of all these priests, these Jesuits, those who fought and died fighting and those who did not fight and died trying to bring God's word down on earth. The only thing that came for all of them was bullets, bullets and more bullets. Is that pattern human, historical, or plain characteristic of one particular period? But why does it come back up so regularly through the centuries?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelineslles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Let me echo what others have said: this is the best blu-ray I've seen yet.  The picture is brilliant of course, but the PCM sound at 24 bits will also rock your speakers.  The special in-movie features are the best implementation so far of what blu-ray can offer us.  You can feel the dedication and love when watching them - so removed from some of the tacked on 10 'making of' bits we get even on most blu-ray today.    This disk should be held as a standard to other studios when they whine about people not buying enough blu ray.  If every disk were like this I'd be broke buying them.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I never would've discovered Metallica if it wasn't for the Black Album. I never would've discovered metal or given it a chance if it wasn't for the Black Album. I never would've picked up a guitar eight years ago if it wasn't for Metallica. I was lost in the musically shallow trance of MTV and anything that it fed me, until I heard a song called \\"Enter Sandman,\\" and it changed my life. I know...that sounds really lame.    All that being said, the Black Album did not end up being my favorite Metallica album. That honor goes to Master of Puppets. It is perhaps one of the most outstanding albums ever made. That being said, Metallica has never truly disappointed. I've gone from child to adult listening to this music. I understand the need to grow and change musically, and they have done that, sometimes to the disappointment of fans.    Primarily, most fans considered what used to be Metallica dead after 1997. Load, and later, Reload, had disappointed some fans, but kept strong fans brought to Metallica by the semi-hookiness of the Black Album satisfied. If you understand the intent behind the musical creations on Load and Reload, it's easier to accept them as Metallica albums. Before, anything the group didn't consider good as a democracy (all members agreed that the music written was good and they would keep it for the album) would die in the studio. On Load and Reload, they would take an idea and rework it until it sounded good to all of them. During this period, Kirk Hammett was also heavily influenced by his ever-increasing interest in the blues and jazz. This is very much reflected in the soloing on Load and Reload (very stripped down, bluesier, non-composed solos). Seeing these albums from the point of view of their creators makes them better than most consider them to be.    St. Anger was a complete departure from anything Metallica, other than James Hetfield's vocals. The express purpose of the album was to embody pure, unadulterated (which means badly edited and raw) anger. No solos, tuning down to C and drop C (like a nu metal group), and focusing on a raw, almost punkish sound were new territories for Metallica. The purposefully detuned drum kit of Lar Ulrich, specifically the snare, became the signature sound of this album (everyone already hated him for the Napster crap...the drum sound was Bob Rock's idea). St. Anger is James Hetfield's idea after coming out of rehab. I'm not sure how he sold the group on it. Was this a good decision? Probably not. It completely alienated fans who had started to dislike Metallica during the Load and Reload era. It alienated Jason Newstead (who said, \\"f@#* this\\"), who was literally traded in a fair swap for Ozzy/BLS bassist Robert Trujillo. Is St. Anger awful? After the first three or four times you listen to it, you'll start to like some aspects of it. After listening to it about fifteen to twenty times, you'll never want to hear it again and throw it out of the window of your car. It has no lasting value, like the other recordings do, and it's not a traditional Metallica album. I understand it, I accept it, and I move on.    Death Magnetic is a semi-return to what Metallica used to be. This is due in part to producer Rick Rubin, who most notably resurrected Trent Reznor's career and helped him deal with drug addiction on NIN's With Teeth and probably saved Aerosmith from extinction by introducing them to Run DMC. However, it is mainly due to the response of diehard fans to the epic failure of St. Anger.    The speed of ...And Justice For All has returned on Death Magnetic. This is very apparent on \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"My Apocalypse.\\" There are still many changes to an old sound that Metallica has acknowledged. The EQ scoop and compression, allowing primarily only the highs and the lows, which was a signature sound to the first four albums, is no longer employed. The bite and bark of midtones is very apparent. Kirk Hammett is no longer spending as much time on solo composition,instead choosing to improvise at the moment, do several different takes, pick the take he likes and others like, use that take, and relearn it. Lars has returned to his drum sound, but its not as machine like. In fact, many of the tracks lack the tightness of the first four Metallica albums, although the musicianship is still very tight.    I do have some complaints, as there are things I dislike about any recent Metallica effort.     Kirk Hammett has returned to metal soloing, but would've done better to spend more time logically composing solos instead of using a looser technique and playing what feels right. That's not to say play machine like solos in a particular style, but to only keep the looser parts that really, really work (go back and listen to Kill 'em All for an idea of what this means).    Some of the rhythm parts are weak and seem like Metallica is still taking what is mostly a turd and polishing it into a lump of gold a la Load and Reload. This is not awful, but some of the riffs seem forced, like they're looking for that Master of Puppets/Ride the Lightning sound.    I hate the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption.\\" It is a turd sandwich of an instrumental. It sounds stretched in length (parts are repeated for far too long) and it also sounds like there were supposed to be lyrics. There are very few well-harmonized or arranged parts. It would've helped the song if James played scooped EQ and Kirk kept the mids, instead of both guitarists keeping the mids. The \\"Redemption\\" part plays a very small role. If you're going to create a dicotomy, go ahead and exploit each part of it. It's like they were trying for that \\"Orion\\" into \\"Damage, Inc\\" ending that helps make Master of Puppets such a great recording.    Many fans will recall that the instrumentals were primarily arranged and harmonized by the late, great Cliff Burton, a person who had actually studied music in school (okay...we know Kirk studied with Satch and later at Berkeley). Cliff Burton helpedconvert a single riff of Dave Mustaine's (later used in Megadeth's \\"Hangar 18\\") into \\"Call of Cthulu,\\" a now classic metal instrumental. Needless to say, my version of Death Magnetic does not include \\"Suicide & Redemption.\\"    Overall, Death Magnetic is a good album, and a great comeback that is much needed for Metallica. Fans have to remember that the reason the first four albums were so good is that they were released over a period of five years, giving them great continuity, and there was a drive and determination to perpetuate a unique, fast, tight sound that had never been done before (and has now been done to death by many other bands...why remake the same album eight times, but slightly different each time?). It was a sound that could sellout arenas without significant radio air play and very little promotion other than word of mouth.    Will Death Magnetic sellout arenas? You bet. It's the breadth of Metallica's reach on the world in the last ten years and the certain aspects of a sound that is distinctly Metallica. New audiences are introduced to it all the time. Plus, 22 years later, they can still rock the tracks from Master of Puppets like nothing ever changed.

006135323X|4.0|Predictably Irrational is one of several popular books about the way people really make decisions and judgments. This growing sub-genre includes Nudge, Sway and Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me).<br /><br />Ariely lucidly explains the findings of various experiments about decision making. It's easy to find applications in marketing: offering options that serve as anchor points and recognizing the power of \\"free.\\" These findings are useful but I would like to see more discussion of the implications for everyday life.<br /><br />For example, most of us cannot predict how we will behave when we're swept up by strong emotions.  Yet every day judgments are made by jurors in courtrooms based on, \\"Well, if I were in that situation...\\"<br /><br />Ariely points out the futility of taking too long to make certain decisions. One friend kept dithering over the choice of a digital camera, only to forego months of memories captured on film.<br /><br />Similarly, he feels he took too long to evaluate a job offer from Stanford. But for major life decisions, a lengthy process can be rational, even if you sacrifice current productivity. You have a greater likelihood of identifying the fact or factor that will be the ultimate deal-breaker.<br /><br />Ariely created an experiment to demonstrate that keeping options open comes with a high cost. So, he says, keeping one job or one residence for a long time can have a high payoff. Maybe. But often outsourcing options or industry shifts will kill a career. As a career consultant, I advise clients to focus on marketability, not security.<br /><br />Second, Ariely shows that money changes relationship dynamics. As he says, your family would be insulted if you offered to pay for Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />But while he advocates a greater role for social norms (p. 88), money norms often smooth difficult transactions. The New York Times magazine recently featured an article by an unmarried professional woman who needed a kidney. She wished she could just pay for what she wanted instead of being forced into difficult conversations that threatened her friendships.<br /><br />Many of us who move frequently have learned to pay packers and movers rather than seek help from well-meaning friends. After all, your helper might drop your new high-definition TV on the sidewalk (maybe breaking a toe in the process).<br /><br />The absence of money also affects relationships. When strangers email to ask how to resolve a challenging career question or fix a troubled website, I often wonder what goes through their minds. When friends ask, they risk the friendship.<br /><br />Third, Ariely suggests (p 121) that we apply lessons from auto maintenance to motivate individuals to undergo medical exams. This reasoning seems flawed.<br /><br />Tests won't prolong lives the way regular oil changes prolong the lives of car engines. After a diagnosis of disease, you should consider false positives. You embark on a journey of life-changing (and life-threatening) medical procedures, lifestyle changes, battles with insurance companies and endless waits to deal with rushed, indifferent or even rude medical staff. A better analogy would be to compare medical exams to auto diagnostics (which car owners rarely choose) or else compare teeth cleaning to oil changes.<br /><br />Insurance creates economic disincentives that muddy the waters. I know several people who had tests that came back negative -- no disease. A few months later, these folks developed symptoms that suggested a need to repeat the tests. In every case, the insurance company said, \\"No -- you get one a year.\\" One person told me her doctor ruled out her disease based on a test she'd taken a few months earlier. So skipping a routine exam can be rational.<br /><br />Any benefits of early detection accrue to the individual, not society or insurance companies. Those who stay alive while making ongoing demands on the medical system will cost more than those who are rushedto the hospital in crisis and die shortly afterward.<br /><br />In any case, Ariely discusses how doctors resist research findings that point to the effectiveness of placebos. Just what is rational thinking, anyway?<br /><br />Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Ariely's writing entertains as well as informs. We all need to base our decisions and our lives on how human minds really work, not what \\"everybody\\" knows.st research findings that point to the effectiveness of placebos.

0553573411|4.0|\\"Royal Assassin\\" is a worthy sequel to its predacessor \\"Assassin's Apprentice\\". This is where our charming young hero Fitz really comes into his own in his strange little world where he is caught between the royal family with whom he can never quite truly bond and his duty as the court assassin.<br /><br />The fantasy and plot continue to strengthen in this amazing novel, and open us up to an entirely new world outside the palace walls where Fitz grows into more than he ever dreamed possible. That is my testament to Hobb's talent at character development.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, and the entire book vibrates with intense mystery and passionate love.<br /><br />I don't read a heck of a lot of fantasy, but this is certainly worth reading. Hobb is a wonderful writer with a marvelous sense of prose and a feeling for high fantasy.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|I wanted to like this film, ever since seeing it when it first was released (even after hearing Keanu's pathetic and blatantly poor attempt at an English accent ... which drives me to giggles every time he opens his mouth). The film was so grand and sweeping; it had such a feeling of large scale and of power. And it was a fun nod to the old school horror films of the 1930's and 1940's. Yes, this Dracula movie has impressive looks, atmosphere, blood, and some panache. You almost admire the quaint visual tricks, the matte painting backgrounds, the whole retro feel to the filmmaking.<br /><br />There is much enthusiasm for this film from its fans, and even I enjoy certain things it possesses: the glorious sets and production design, the vivid colors, the sound design, the lovely costumes, the grand music, the swirling fog, the old fashioned feel. But it leaves me feeling empty and unsatisfied after viewing it. There's something missing, some meat that should be on the bones here. The only metaphor I can come up with for \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is like trying a cake that has an amazing frosting which is beautiful; then when you get to the inside, there's sawdust. This version, which is simply eye candy, just doesn't satisfy me thoroughly. (But, hey, the eye candy is certainly striking.)

0743290119|3.0|Leigh, Adriana, and Emmy are three long-time friends and NYC residents rapidly approaching their thirtieth birthdays. Trouble is, none these ladies are particularly happy about this looming milestone. Leigh is a seemingly successful, type-A editor whose \\"perfect life\\" is actually anything but. She's in a relationship with charming, handsome sportscaster Russell, whose love seems suffocating and almost depressing to her, and her new client, eclectic author Jesse Chapman, proves to be a challenging case in unexpected ways. Meanwhile, Adriana, used to relying on her Brazilian gorgeousness to seduce any man she desired and spending her days doing little more than using her parents' money, wonders if she is losing her \\"touch\\" when it comes to men. Even more importantly in Adriana's case-does the ever-approaching \\"30\\" mean that it's time to actually commit to one man only? And for Emmy, recently dumped by boyfriend Duncan and feeling increasingly desperate for a baby, does her newly single status mean it's time to follow her friends' urgings, abandon her former \\"serial monogamist\\" tendencies, and embark on a man-catching adventure that will be the opposite of anything she's ever done before? With all of the drama surrounding the love lives (and general lives) of these \\"ringless wonders,\\" the year ahead of them will be anything but ordinary...<br /><br />While this book is not nearly the crisp, original page-turner that \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" was, it wasn't completely terrible either. Weisenberger's writing style is still pleasantly breezy and easy to read, making \\"Harry Winston\\" a decent anecdote to whatever arduous task you're recovering from or avoiding. And, I have to admit, I found that I usually wanted to keep reading just to see how pulpy crises of these women's love lives turned out.<br /><br />But speaking of the characters, it is unfortunate to say that they were not the kind that are completely lovable (or easy to relate to). Leigh frequently comes across as a joyless \\"fun sponge\\" who readers will often wish they could just admonish to break up with Russell and relax already! Adriana's silliness does entertain during some of the novel, but then again, how much can readers enjoy a character who manages to whine her way through half of a novel, despite having a limitless designer wardrobe, looks to rival Gisele Bundchen's, and all the money she could desire without working? Emmy seemed like the sweetest of the characters, but the fact that she was portrayed as somehow \\"deficient\\" because she had not slept with hundreds of men during her life was disappointing.<br /><br />So, you're not missing fabulous chick-lit if you pass over this offering, but if you do check it out from the library, realize that the not-so-subtle sluttiness=happiness message and lukewarm characters will make it little more than a decent diversion.

B00005JLWN|5.0|I don't remember ever seeing any press on this movie, and I only picked it up after watching just about every other sci-fi ever made. I was very surprised to find that this is a movie I could watch over and over.<br /><br />One thing I found impressive was the creation of a very different vision of the future. The sets and costumes along with the culture combined to create a believable world. The story grabbed me in and kept me interested. I found myself really caring about what happened to the main characters. As the story unfolded I found the action sequences to be incredibly choreographed with a form of battle combining guns and movement that I've never seen anywhere else. It was a combination of really exciting action and good story telling.<br /><br />This is a movie that's easy to overlook, but I recommend it to any real sci-fi fan.

0375826726|1.0|I think that in order to make an extra book and earn more money, Paulini has taken the charm out of a promising series. The third book is too long, too boring and without a plot. It does nothing to advance the series, neither does it have any surprising turns that excite the reader through the entire book. The book could well have been shortened to a 150 page volume with no real loss to the plot. I had to push myself to complete the book

B001DZLAWI|5.0|This album isn't too bad. I don't think it is a return to the old metallica as extension of the last album st. anger with lots of guitar solos this time and even worst production that causes the cd version to have an average decibel rate of almost -6 on the loudest track. In all my years of making cd compilations for my personal use I have never seen a song that loud or almost unbearable to listen too. The vinyl version isn't as loud as the cd but there is still a lot of distortion on the album. If you got the xbox 360 or playstation 3 you can download the album for the guitar hero 3 or the new one coming out and those versions are not brickwalled.

B000ZLFALS|4.0|This movie blew me away.  I heard mixed reviews, but finally broke down to see it, and within the first 30 seconds I was hooked.  Beatles Purists comlpain, but I love the Beatles passionately and felt that this movie only enhanced my understanding of the whole era and their music.    Yes, the plot is flimsy, so don't go expecting to find some amazing dialogue and story line.  I do love the way that the movie outlines actual events in history though.  It begins with a kid from Liverpool coming to find his father in a very apple pie America.  Many of the scenes are just pure fun (and made me wish I could have been in this film) such as the scene in the bowling alley or the one set at Princeton - \\"I've Just Seen a Face,\\" and \\"A Little Help From My Friends.\\"  We travel through time to the draft for the Vietnam war, the Detroit riots, the Electric Koolaid acid tests and the Merry Pranksters in their magic bus, the disillusionment that came from the violence of the counter-revolution, and finally it all wraps up neatly with the rooftop performance- mirroring the Beatles' own final concert.     The music is for the most part outstanding, and the visual representations of the songs are pure genius at times.  Particularly outstanding were the visual representations of the songs \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy,\\" depicting soldiers being sent off to war with Uncle Sam pointing his finger and singing \\"I Want You.\\" (How could you not love that?)  Also, Bono's psychedilic  \\"I am the Walrus\\" leads into an underwater version of \\"Because.\\" It made me feel like I was in an altered state of mind despite my sobriety.       There are cute little Beatles references throughout, such as names of characters, mention of someone coming in through the bathroom window, etc.  It gets a little tiresome at times though.  The movie was about 30 minutes longer than it needed to be.  Still, a huge achievement, and incredibly creative and stunningly beautiful.  It's even better to watch the second time when you can skip through all the boring dialogue, and jump to your favorite musical numbers.
0375826726|4.0|When I first picked up Eragon years back I was recovering from a severe ankle sprain that kept me off my feet for a good space of time. I need something to keep me company and video games just weren't cutting it, so I read Eragon and have been enthralled with this series ever sense.   I enjoyed this book very much...of course I will enjoy any fantasy because they all follow the same pattern, so it's easy to get into something like this. A lot of people are frustrated that this book is similar to Lord of the Rings. Well I can point out a lot of really good Fantasies that follow that pattern. Tolkien was the father of it and all these other fantasy books are his kids that have taken pointers from their father.  Having said that I get back to my original review.    Brisingr was good I couldn't put it down I was entertained the whole read. It's one of them books that you can pick up and get lost in it and not feel bad in the end when you're done because you realize that you just wasted a bunch of time. Paolini continues getting better as this series moves along. The plot, character development, and everything else is maturing along with the writer. That is one of the reasons that this book is so enthralling. Eragon is growing up right in front of our eyes along with all those that are connected to him.  In the beginning there is a daring rescue...this is a brilliant way to start this book. And then we continue on an incredible path of friendship, love, courage, emotion, humor, insubordination, and tragedy. I think these are the perfect ingredients to a fun fast paced story. Also, do not let the movie detour you from this series, they are on two different playing fields...the books are much better! Read to the very end! This series is for fantasy lovers of all ages...this book is just a fun entertaining read. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT?!  Books like these replace TV any day!

0385338082|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I could be or knew Emma (the main character) she was very likeable and sweet. It's a great quick read, it only took me about 4 days. It's just such a cute, sweet book. I didn't want it to end!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Great comeback by Metallica. This is one of their best. Track 5 \\"All Nightmare Long\\" is my favorite.
0393061310|2.0|A rich gravy of erudition smothers a thin slice of slightly tainted meat, i.e. the thesis (it's all geography & luck) is undoubtedly wrong, or, at the very best, accounts for tiny proportion of the discrepancies he attempts to explain. For detailed analysis, see the # 1 review by Christopher Smith (whom I don't know). There's more critical thought in that review than in the book itself.     On the other hand, the \\"gravy\\" alone, the research and erudition, is probably worth the price of the book. Otherwise, see David Landes, \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations.\\"
B001DU8T6I|4.0|I purchased this for my 8 year old, who also listens to miley cyrus and the jonas brothers.  I believe this is the best of the lot, a little more of a rock edge, with more guitar.  Demi's voice is very good, although a little breathy.  The songs are more interesting and varied than the other albums.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|I was enjoying this film up until the last 20 minutes or so. We have an enjoyable , intelligent science fiction space drama with some real moments of suspense as the gallant crew attempts to complete their mission of \\"re-igniting\\" the dying Sun, when ... WHAM!...out of left field comes this inane, confusing slasher flic finale. What a bummer! It's like the director took ill before the film was finished and handed over the end to his insane nephew who had his own vision of what the film should be.       A real waste of time, folks. File this under \\"When Good Films Go Bad\\"
015206396X|5.0|The Graceling is the extraordinary first novel by Kristin Cashore. It is being sold as young adult fiction, but this is a book for everyone.    Katsa is the heroine of the story and is Graced with the ability to kill. Grace has a magically exceptional ability in a particular area. The Graced are marked by eyes of two different colors. They are used and feared, and none of them more than Katsa. King Randa, her uncle, uses her to brutalize any who dare disagree with him. She feels trapped by her own violence.    In response she starts a Council whose task is to ameliorate the violence and injustice that rules the central five of the Seven Kingdoms. While she is rescuing someone from prison she meets Po, who is the first person outside of the Council who is neither afraid of her-nor interested in using her. Katsa struggles with her desire to be just herself and not the royal thug. She starts learning about herself and her Grace, discovering that it may just be more than killing that she is good at.    The Graceling is one of those rare books that I wanted to start over as soon as I had finished it. The characters are believable and grab our attention and sympathy. It is unusual to read a book with so many strong, complex people inhabiting its pages. At every point these people are learning and wrestling with who they are and what they are for.    It is Kristin Cashore's first novel and it is the best first novel I have read in some time. She is bringing out another book set in the same milieu next year, and I will be waiting anxiously to read it. If you have teens, buy them this book, then borrow it and read it for yourself.    Armchair Interviews says: You won't regret it.
B0010AN7Y0|3.0|Upon watching this movie, I was reminded of The Big Chill.  After the movie, I saw that the DVD blurb compared it to The Big Chill.  Wow, I feel intelligent now.<br /><br />Seriously, the beginning was so god-awful bad that it turned me against the movie.  But I'm so glad I kept watching.  At the end, when they referred back to the beginning to complete the cycle, the formula was complete.  For me, that part didn't work and was downright painful in its stupidity.  But everything in between was brilliant.  How strange.<br /><br />Look at the cast, and you will expect great acting.  You'll get it.  I already knew Rita Rudner as a perceptive and funny stand-up comic.  As you would expect, that does translate to her writing.  It turns out she can act, too.<br /><br />Actually, I see 3.5 or 3.75 stars here.  But some of the other reviewers were a bit too complimentary, so I thought I'd rein them in a bit.  It's a character-driven, perceptive gem of a film, and I'll be generous and assume that the \\"sexpot\\" character was meant to be every bit annoying as she is.  I've forgotten her name, or to care.  It's a fine film indeed.

B000HIVOFU|5.0|This recording sounds great in SACD - multichannel as well as in an ordinary CD-player. The hair on my arms rises when I hear the voice of Rebecca Pidgeon singing Spanish Harlem on this record. There are several amazing vocals here. The record is also perfect for testing your Speakers and hardware. The base on this recording is amazing. Also here it's the recording of Spanish Harlem that puts the gear to a test. You will love the sound of this record.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I was very dissapointed in this transfer--  Specifically in the early G-1 wedding sequences, the whites are wayyyy  washed out and in fact there are some scenes where it appears as if they are adjusting the F-Stops during the transfer and the effect is distracting; There is additionally a short sequence when Michael goes to the hospital to check on his father...a short clip that appears to have been skipped from the restoration--damaged and grainy-out of whack with teh rest of the repair; THe seond half of G-1 looks OK and G-2 looks OK as well---but a very uneven opening for G-1 and I aggree that it prob was not worth the money to go to this Blu-Ray version.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|I never thought another movie could beat the original Lugosi film, but this movie comes very close. It takes the character of Dracula and makes him a horrible monster, but also sympathetic. You can't help but feel, and maybe understand, somewhat why Dracula does what he does. Gary Oldman is amazing in the title role and makes the character extremely believable. The special effects are incredible, and although it wasn't that long ago, the movie still holds up to this day. This will surely go down as a classic, and that is saying a lot for a remake. This movie brought a lot and delivers. I highly recommend this movie
0375826726|3.0|Christopher Paolini was fifteen when he began Eragon. He followed Eragon with Eldest and at twenty-four he's written Brisingr, the third book in the Inheritance Cycle. Paolini's first book, Eragon was made into a motion picture in 2006. The Inheritance Cycle started as a trilogy and grew into a four-book series.    Like Stephanie Meyers or J.K. Rowling's series, a synopsis of Brisingr is probably not necessary as most people really know the books and just want to read the next. They are however, interested in what others think of the newest release. That is what I will focus on in my review.    In Brisingr there are more wonderful adventures afoot. Eragon is compelled to rescue his cousin Roran's beloved from the King. The Varden need Eragon's help and in general, tyranny is running rampant through the land and must be quashed. Success is in the decisions and actions of our hero Eragon. Will he be successful? Oh, and it must be mentioned that there are some fantastic revelations in Brisingr.    Brisingr is in many ways a better book than Eragon and Eldest. And in other ways, it's not as good. Paolini's writing is getting better with each book, but because it's a story of adventure, it could have benefited from some editing. I think it was too long, at times too wordy (I could have used less explanations and `telling') and that distracted from the story. Some problems were `fixed' far too easily and that rang hollow for me. I was surprised that the trilogy has been extended to a fourth book and believe that it could have been handled in three with editing.    But with those criticisms aside it really is an enjoyable read. For the most part it is an exciting fantasy that readers will enjoy. Those fans of the earlier book will forgive most of the books limitations. And in the long run, it took me only a week to read and that means Paolini kept my attention to the end.    Armchair Interviews says: Brisingr's fantasy is worth the read.
031606792X|5.0|\\"Breaking Dawn\\" is the conclusion to the much anticipated Twilight saga.  I was extremely excited about this book, and it did not let me down in the least bit.  Bella and Edward's relationship continues to strenghten, as well as Bella and Jacob's.  Their is an interesting twist between Bella and Jacob and Edward that no one expected and I am not going to spoil that for you. Bella has many challenges to face along with the decision to become a vampire.  Breaking Dawn is full of suspense, and is, of course, a page turner.  You will not want to put this book down until you have finished it!  Buy it, read it, and reccomend it to every single girl you know!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I love this film, always have, always will. HOWEVER the color restoration turned practically every characters' hair red. Wendy and John certainly never had red hair before. Although the original color is dated, it is much more beautiful.
B00000634L|5.0|To enjoy this album in its entirety you need to have a pretty varied taste in music. Someone looking for only light pop-y music will probably only like \\"exactly like me\\" and \\"everywhere\\", some more laid back alt. rock in \\"couch surfer\\", \\"supermodel\\" and \\"mama don't smoke\\" are weird folksy type songs that took me a while to get into. then there's a variety of hip-hop songs on here too, but basically theres 5 or 6 genres of music represented on here so don't get the album if you hear 1 song and expect them all to be like that.
1400032717|5.0|I know this book has garnered a large and varied response, ranging from disdain for its unconventional structure and use of vulgar words to an admiration for how it views real life from a detached point of view. However, I found that I rather liked this book, and found it a genuinely touching book.    I won't dwell into how Haddon constructs the story, but Haddon's story is thought-provoking and touching at the same time. Haddon's plot questions the disdain we have towards people who are not of our thinking, and his drawing of the characters is so real that you feel as if you could reach out to touch them. I am struck by the way that Haddon draws the character of Christopher, because in some ways he shares many of our frustrations but yet he is still a loveable character. His untangling of the vicissitudes of everyday people is what propels the story forward. I know the plot may not be the best in how it moves abruptly to the investigation of the murder of a dog to the conflict between his parents. However, once you find that the parental disagreement is the heart of the novel and the dog incident is the key to it, the plot begins to make sense.    I know some people have raised concerns about the vulgarities peppered throughout the book. As such I see that it isn't suitable for children. I'm aware that such words, especially the F-word, are offensive but even so the expletives aren't the essence of the book and don't detract from Christopher's dealings with his predicaments.     In short, I heartily recommend this book to all, as one of the most interesting, and accessible, novels of recent years.
B0013FFMOK|2.0|This story had so many horrible plot holes that by the end I was glad it was over.  Will Smith doesn't sacrifice himself to save the world; he just wants out of the lousy story he's become a part of.<br /><br />The opening scene is a ridiculous, pathetic masturbatory commercial for the [[ASIN:B0014CGBDS Ford Mustang GT500]].  I mean, really, who would hunt deer from a speeding sports car, even if you actually could?  This opening had me shaking my head in disappointment, and the rest of the movie didn't take that feeling away.<br /><br />The CGI was lame, shallow and low-budge throughout.  Almost all of the viral-zombies (VZs) were CGI, and were not convincing.<br /><br />All the VZs did was run really fast, climb like vampire-monkeys, and of course open their mouths really wide and roar a lot.  Man, we've seen this dumbass mouthy-roaring gimmick a million times since it became the de rigueur monster stunt in the first [[ASIN:B000ASATYY Mummy]] movie.  Now it's just trite and predictable, and no longer effective.<br /><br />So, Will Smith is an Army LTC doctor, with a massive townhouse right on Washington Square in the heart of Manhattan, with a completely outfitted viral research suite in the basement?  And he has all of the trappings of the pre-Armageddon life because he's resourceful n' stuff n' all?  Yeah, puh-leeze.<br /><br />And he powers all this stuff in his house and the lab with three or four Honda--nice product placement!--generators, which we see running happily . . . in the flipping pantry!  Hollywood, there is this odorless, colorless gas, called carbon monoxide, which is emitted in the process of combustion, which . . . aw, the hell with it.<br /><br />In an abandoned city, the first electrical short or lightning strike will start a fire, which with everyone including the fire department dead, will burn out of control.  If there was such a struggle at the end of humanity, wouldn't there be a battle or two, maybe a little fire here and there?  In a city as dense as NYC, all of Manhattan would burn for weeks.  Nope, none of that, no evidence of it.  Just rusty cars and some grass in the cracks of the pavement.<br /><br />In a tense scene early on, we see the VZs for the first time in a very dark room strewn with bundles of money, a bank vault--on a second floor.  I mean, seriously, who puts a massive bank vault on the second floor?  Who reviews these settings and agrees to shoot them?<br /><br />If the VZs come out at night and are so flipping voracious, why are there so many deer running all over the island?  If animals can be infected, too, why are there so many deer running all over the island?<br /><br />If the VZs are so screamingly (literally) violent, why haven't they all killed and eaten each other yet?<br /><br />Our hero, the brilliant doctor, makes the crucial observation of the VZs that they have lost all semblance of human behavior, yet the VZ \\"leader\\" steals a mannequin from one of the hero's haunts, moves it to a crucial location, and sets a clever trap, clearly learned from watching the hero do the same thing earlier.  And then the VZ leader-guy sics three apparently trained--these are supposed to be completely unhinged, ultra-violent critters, right?--viral-zombie dogs on our hero.  I mean, if the VZs were this smart, why aren't they driving cars and carrying weapons themselves?<br /><br />Our hero has weapons stashed everywhere, and knows how to put them into action, too.  Until, that is, when it's time for things to go south and the finale to come.  Then he just can't hit a thing, even on full auto.  Junk.<br /><br />At the end, the VZ leader-guy breaks his way slowly through the unbreakable lab glass by smashing his head and body into it repeatedly, with no signs whatsoever of any kind of physical trauma.  But, uh, we've seen throughout the movie that although highly infected, and completely psycho, these VZ guys after all are physical beings which are more or less human in frame, strength andstamina, injured and killed with violence which would do the same to a human, even brought down by one or more shots from a firearm.  But when the Big Dramatic Finish comes, it's time for the VZ bad-guy leader to suddenly become so much more, an &uuml;ber-zombie, if you will.  Barf.<br /><br />Manhattan is an island, right?  How did the heroine-lady get onto it with her son?  And how did she get off?<br /><br />I will say this: Will Smith does do some pretty heavy acting in a couple of scenes, especially early on.  I'll give the man that much, with no reservations.  His environments may be CGI, but his acting is real, solid and powerful.  That German Shepherd was doing some pretty heavy \\"acting,\\" too--that was one really well-trained canine.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm amazed this didn't get to DVD faster, given the shockingly inept story.  But the story Will Smith is working with is junk.  Don't pay to rent this.  Wait for it on video, or see it on a buddy's dime; then it will be worth your time.by one or more shots from a firearm.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had actually not heard of North and South until about a week ago. I read a description, realized it was just my type of story, and rented it. All I can say is wow. It was incredibly beautiful, stunning, romantic, and interesting. Richard Armitage was absolutely amazing, and I fell head over heels in love with him and the entire story! I love miniseries because they allow relationships to grow deeply and more naturally - I could truly feel the love and passion between the two!     This and Pride and Prejudice are far and away the best BBC miniseries out there, and quite possibly the best historical romances ever made!
B000M3452Y|5.0|This is probably one of the better albums of the decade so far; most likely top 25 for sure. The 5th track: \\"All My Friends\\" is a brilliant 7 1/2 minute epic that, by itself, is worth the price of the album. It does have a weak moment(s) in the title track \\"Sound of Silver\\" and to some extend \\"Watch the Tapes\\" which are both decent songs but have a tough act to follow after the genius of track 5 and the impressive track 6. I recommend this album for sure. I also recommend that you listen with head phone as you'll pick up on much of James Murphy's subtleties.

031606792X|4.0|I've been reading this series from the first month the first book hit the shelf.  I thought the cover was interesting the idea was unique.  Yet, I always believed that the books were not as huge and wonderful as everyone made them out to be.  They were okay and interesting, but that's it.  Now, reading all the reviews I have to laugh.  You've only noticed where this was going now?  You haven't picked up on all the inappropriate propaganda until now?  Ooookaaaay.<br /><br />What got me with this book was how it started off with the baby vampires.  I was getting flashbacks to \\"Salem's Lot\\" by King.  You know, that scene where they remove the floorboard to find the young couple with the baby vampire in their arms.  Ewww!  There are some places where you just shouldn't go and messing with babies is one of them.  Jake's imprinting on Nessie didn't bother me so much.  It was explained that the werewolf would be whatever his intended needed him to be.  And if it means a caregiver when they are infants and children, then that is what he will be.  What did bother me was the get married and need sex at 18 aspect.  Very juvenile. Other than that it was good, not great, but good--like all the others.
B0018CMJSU|3.0|This Review is based on The Standard DVD format Restoration, not The Blu-ray Version.<br /><br />I'm on the fence about this New Restoration Box Set(The Restored GODFATHER III is a cleaner version), but I'm leaning towards an all-out PAN of this New Restoration. Unfortunately, I listened to some of the reviewers here and purchased this Set. (A couple of you owe me a few bucks.) It doesn't look like any of the reviewers here did a side-by-side comparison test of The New Restoration and The Original Versions of these films on DVD. I did mine on a 50\\" Panasonic plasma.<br /><br />Yes, the New prints have fewer scratches, dirt, and grain than The Original Set, (which is not as bad as some reviewers suggest). But, the COLOR ENHANCEMENT of The New Restoration Set is OVERLY saturated in many parts. Especially, in the Red Scale. Yellows and orange flesh tones are extremely pronounced, overly brilliant, and unnatural looking in this Set. And it still contains scratches, dirt, and grain. Not as much as The Original Set, but it's still there. A lot of the grain in certain frames has been removed, while other frames remain untouched and appear to be just as grainy as The Original Version. A very uneven transfer in my opinion.<br /><br />In the opening shot of THE GODFATHER, the Undertaker is so overly saturated with yellow that as the camera pulls back to reveal Don Corleone's desk, it renders The Undertaker almost out of focus. Trust me, this shot looks far better in The Original Set. Compare the shot in THE GODFATHER of Luca Brasi in his apartment, donning his bulletproof vest, in preparation for his meeting with Sollozzo. The colors in The Original Version look natural, while The Restoration renders Luca's apartment in a blazing wash of bright sunshine yellow. These frames are entirely over-saturated with color. I assure you, certain frames of this Restoration DO NOT look anything like the Original film stock print. The warm and natural looking sepia tone of The Original film has been blasted away with digital color in many frames, almost making them look unreal.<br /><br />THE GODFATHER II has been compressed onto one disc, while The Original Version was compressed onto 2 discs.<br /><br />(By the way, I could care less about The TV Saga Version. It's not the way these films were shot, and it's not the way they were intended to be seen.)<br /><br />Some frames of The New Restoration look very grainy, some look  incredible, while other frames make these films appear as if Ted Turner Colorized them. At times, I wasn't sure if I was watching THE GODFATHER, or SPEED RACER.<br /><br />Is this version worth a Double Dip? I'm still on the fence about that. But, I think I prefer The Original Box Set over this half-baked attempt at improving this Classic with an over-saturation of color.<br /><br />I get the feeling that The Blu-ray Version must look really odd. Blu-ray is great technology for newer films. Older films tend to suffer from over-saturation with this technology. The public is so enamoured with Blu-ray, they don't realize some of the classic older films don't resemble their original celluloid color exposures anymore. And that's a shame. It's going to take some more time before remastering technicians understand the remastering treatment that some of these classic older films deserve. Sometimes less is more.<br /><br />If you must have The Restoration, turn the brightness and color way down on your TV.<br /><br />I'm calling this THE GODFATHER: THE COPPOLA VIDEO GAME GIFTSET.<br /><br />Act accordingly.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />There is no question that this Standard DVD Remastered Version is overly saturated with color. Here is a pretty SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT SOLUTION that seems to work quite well, reproduces truer color, and makes these Remastered films much more enjoyable. At least it did on my 50\\" Panasonic Viera plasma. (I also use this for The Anniversary Remaster of SCARFACE which is also overly saturated with color.) Stay away from the VIVID and CINEMA Picture Settings. Use the STANDARD Picture Setting which will give you the following numbers: Picture 50, Brightness 50, Color 50, Tint 0, and Sharpness 75. Simply tune the COLOR setting down from 50 to 35. I found that changes to the other settings were not necessary. This should take care of the overly saturated playback color issue. I do not know whether this adjustment will work as well with an LCD, Projection, Tube TV, or Blu-Ray Disc.you the following numbers: Picture 50, Brightness 50, Color 50, Tint 0, and Sharpness 75.

0375826726|2.0|So, I liked Eragon and Eldest. I overlooked the pretentious vocabulary and some fluff and read each page. I even re-read them, just because.  I only do that for select books.    I do not personally care that the author is stealing from Stars Wars, Pern, LOTR, now even Lloyd Alexander (read Brisingr and think pseudo-Cauldron Born). Even the sword thing reminds me of a boy named Shea or maybe Narsil/Andúril... BUT, that said, everyone knows he is using material, and yet we keep reading the trilogy, oops - series.    So, I picked this up on opening day and read it. In the first few pages, I learned the value of skim reading. I do not skim read as a rule, reserving it for a book that is truly full of random facts that do not contribute the plot. I do not care about Dwarf politics or the deep details of elven sword making, at least not the way this author treats it. I do not care about inner angst of a 17 year old.  I skimmed from interesting scene to interesting scene.    Now, before people think I am a fantasy light-weight and I should be flogged for not reading deeply, I will say that I read complete books in detail and rarely skim. Silmarillion-read it three times, Unfinished Tales of Tolkien-read that also. Shannara, Pern, Thomas Covenant (all 6 books), many others. (I also read Harry Potter, but did skim of the looonnnggg sections of the 5th and 6th books)    So, the true test? I will not re-read Brisingr. It is not worth my time.  I have told my wife that I will get the fourth (final?) book from the library.  This my personal review, others will differ. That is the beauty of each having our own minds.    Others will love it.
0446402389|5.0|The reader is steeped in a world as strange as if it was another planet and not the Soviet Union in 1953.  That gray bleak world seeps into your bones and then after it has, the plot develops around a murder.  This is a remarkable book on two levels, the murder mystery and the life of characters in their strange and horrifying society. This is a must read that you won't put down.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I discovered Kings of Leon thanks to their performance on SNL! The minute I heard \\"Sex On Fire\\" and \\"Be Somebody\\" I knew these guys were for real! \\"Only By The Night\\" is one of those albums that the minute you're finished listening to it you're left with the feeling you're in possession of a masterpiece! \\"Closer\\" is an amazing, addictive, blissfully psyquedelic, \\"The Verve-like\\" track that will leave you wanting to hear more. \\"Sex On Fire, Crawl, Manhattan, Revelry and Cold Desert\\" show case Caleb's amazing voice and style! Overall, this band (which reminds me of Candlebox and The Black Crowes) is amazing and should be around for decades to come!

B000JJSRNY|5.0|This concert is amazing! Placido Domingo, at 65 at that time, is, like always, at his best. Even with a baritone tone he still out shines younger singers. But in this concert both Anna and Rolando are just wonderful. They sing with much passion and their voices are fresh and clear. The choice of the music is perfect for a night like that. The set is enchanting.<br />I first saw this concert on the TV and I instantly fell in love with it. I was so happy when I found it on DVD.<br />Rolano Villazon had a smashing success with Rossini's La Danza. Netrebnco followed with Quando men vo in a superb interpretation. I am not her fan, but I really liked her performance at this time.<br />This is a must-have for anyone who loves opera, but not only.<br />The DVD offers great sound  quality and the images just make you feel you are among the lucky spectators in the Berlin arena.<br />I listened this concert for so many times, and I still feel it will never be enough!
0930289234|3.0|For those not familiar with the term \\"graphic novel\\", this is a comic book.  In my own personal opinion, the character development in this book was great, but the story was mediocre at best.  I thought this book was very dry, and the only reason I continued reading was to so I could put the book down and start something else.  Disappointing.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|This review is likely to sound confusing and a bit all over the place, because that's the feeling that I have from Only By The Night. With their first three albums, it took me several listens before I was happy with my purchase.  I now cherish all three.  This new album had some of the same effect, but after several listens, my spirits are still dampened by the extremely toned down energy of these tracks. If you know of the Kings Of Leon from their previous albums, then you know that it's hard not to move your body when they rock their southern boogie style tunes.  With this album, I recommend that you find a comfortable seat to sit yourself down for this group of songs.  It's not that it's so horribly bad, it's just that I don't like the direction that KOL seem to be heading.  It's like they've been nuetered.  And for those of you that say that a band has to \\"evolve\\", I've never bought into whatever the heck that means. You write good music, music that you want to play as a band, and you put it on a CD.  You don't have to go for a certain sound, or aim in a certain direction.  That's putting bounderies on yourself.  I suppose that it works both ways, but Y&YM, ASH & BotT were each unique in their own way, but each was also loaded with cool rocking tunes.  Only By The Night isn't a bad album, and it is a nice addition to the KOL discography, it just pales in comparison to their previous work in my opinion.    It starts off promising with \\"Closer\\", a track much like \\"Knocked Up\\", \\"Trunk\\", or \\"Arizona\\" off of Because Of The Times.  And then the clear cut gem of the album \\"Crawl\\".  \\"Sex On Fire\\" is very good except for the rather unsophisticated title and main lyric.  After that, the album has some ups and some downs, quite often within the same song, but it is a solid set of music.  They just better have cushioned seats at their shows for the Only By The Night tour.

061891868X|5.0|Excellent read.  Smolin's critique of string-them-along string theory in What's Wrong with Physics is greatly superior to Greene's cheerleading treatment of the same topic in The Elegant Universe.  It is interesting the way that physics is being corrupted in a similar way to the financial system in the current crises causing a meltdown on Wall Street: people spewing out equations that nobody really understands and that have little relation to reality.  But Smolin, while enlightening in his insider insights into the achievements and failures of string theory, falls into many of the same faulty assumptions of contemporary physics.  My own view is that special relativity was fairly brilliant, but general relativity is essentially flawed.  Physicists pay too much homage to Einstein, without admitting that he could be wrong.  Remember that nobody has ever found a gravity wave, but general relativity appears to be premised on their existence.  It would be more profitable to seek to create a theory that explicitly makes gravity waves impossible than to continue to believe in any theory where they exist.  And the entire program of unification is suspect.  Why should the Universe require unification when everything we know points to simply finding, over time, that it contains more and more things and phenomena -- different laws at different scales of spatial dimension -- and becomes bigger and bigger than we ever thought before?  The Universe seems to require diversity, not unification.  And while physics flounders, there are legitimate advances in related fields: our understanding of the information sciences and the concept of entropy appear to be critical for any advances in physics.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|this is not a bad movie and its not a great movie.  i tried to like this movie more than i actually did.  the main character was so forgetable that i really did not care about what happens to him.  the acting was really weak except for jamie bell who held the movie together.  it was really short and had all the potential in the world but it missed the mark
B001EO748M|4.0|I couldn't wait to see the second season, and it did not disappoint. But there was no way it could live up to the electricity we saw in season one between Henry and Ann, so only 4 stars.    In the first season, Natalie Dormer stole her scenes without overpowering the other characters. In season two, the story just was not as intense when she was not on screen. However, the last two episodes of season two are the best of both years. You know how it is going to end. Yet you will find yourself hoping for a miracle to save her. Free Ann!

B001C3KCSY|3.0|Okay, if I understand the word \\"Fan\\" it is short for fanatic, and music fans are supposed to be LOYAL to the point of fanaticism, right?  Here is my take on it...KOL has an amazing body of work and now they have offered one more aspect of themselves to their fans.         This new CD is exactly what it says, \\"Only by the night\\"...like winding down at the end of the day...a little more reflective, but still with the simmering undertone of that down home sensuality that we all love.        \\"Manhattan\\" at night, the city that never sleeps...and the spooky town with vampires lurking in \\"Closer\\"...and who hasn't tossed in thier bed at night wondering what thier lover might be doing out on the streets...\\"Use Somebody\\" strikes a chord that resonates to all the lonely people and how they feel in the middle of the dark night...     And then there is \\"Sex on Fire\\"!  Caleb wailing (as only he can) in the heat of the moment...This CD is one that must be listened to again and again for the real flavor to be fully savored.         And now I must hurry off to listen once again before the night is over...  \\"If it's not forever, if it's just tonight, Oh, it's still the greatest, the greatest, the greatest\\"
B000EOTAM6|2.0|there is nothing good about this movie.  we have heard the plot before.  the acting is some of the worst i have ever seen.  the outfits are wrong and it is filmed so badly that i do not care what happens to the rest of the human race.  i think a lot of my problems with the movie was casting.  theron was a horrible pick for the role.  very dissapointed.
B001AJVR5M|1.0|I'm forced to review this because Amazon sent me an email recommending it based on my previous purchases.  What?  In a world of Hannah Montana and High School Musical, the Jonas Brothers are, well, pretty. These kids have great hair.  REALLY great hair.  And they're fashionable, too. VERY fashionable. If you dig patronizingly mainstream, tepid, machine-stamped teeny bop, this is the ticket.  Me, I'd take the Avett Brothers over the Jonas children any day of the week
0060920084|1.0|I gave this book one star only because Amazon doesn't allow the option to select zero stars.    My husband and I have read and enjoyed many of Bill Bryson's books. In the past, we considered him one of our favorite writers. After reading this book, it will be a long time before I open another of his works.    Mr Bryson's petty criticisms of the small towns through which he drove and his obvious contempt for all things Southern will leave any American who loves her country feeling a deep disdain for all things Bryson. While reading this book, there were many times my husband and I would look at one another and ask, \\"What could have happened to him to make a man from the Midwest develop such a negative view of all things American?\\" and \\"Do you think this book was REALLY written by 'our' Bill Bryson?\\" (BTW, we no longer consider him 'our' Bill Bryson.)    I mentioned that Mr Bryson 'drove through' small towns in America because that's exactly what he describes in the book. After a quick, judgmental glimpse of a town, he bypasses it altogether as totally unworthy of his time, money, or attention.     Bryson didn't bother to visit many of the historical attractions along the way. Apparently, he was on a very tight budget. He DID, after all, borrow his mother's old Chevette for the journey. The cost of admission to these sites require him to cut back on his beloved beer and chicken-fried steak.    Last, but definitely not least, Mr Bryson showed himself to be a bigot. His contempt for 'all things white and all things Southern' along with his propensity for revisiting every bit of negative racial history every recorded during his BRIEF drive through the deep South demonstrated just how out of touch he is with the country of his birth and his, obvious, disdain for truth. He chose to ignore any progress made in race relations during the past 40 years. He chose to see, and share, his view that America is, and will always be, the country he would most like to see in 'his rearview mirror'. I, for one, welcome him to return to his country of choice and not bother to darken the doors of the home I love. The last thing the United States of American needs is one more person to describe our country in such negative terms.
0743298039|5.0|Diane Setterfield demonstrates her deep talent for creating a setting and a world that you find yourself lost in.  As a huge fan of Jane Austen's Jane Eyre, this tale was not a retelling of her story; it was instead a new tale woven with different threads but carrying the same tragic theme.  Ms. Setterfield's work is a detailed and facinating story that seems to lead us down several paths, only to expertly and surprisingly tie all of the details together at the end.  Read this on a dark and stormy night and you will not be dissapointed!

B000002H97|5.0|I am a Metallica fan since the late 80s and the black album IMO is one of the best they have released.  Enough said as most of the praise, positive comment and feedbacks have already been mentioned on this comments section so I suggest you start reading others comments.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is a fantastic album. It's a bit on the dumb side, sure - the lyrics are unintentionally hilarious, from the famous middle-school sci-fi scribblings of \\"Iron Man\\" (which is still an absolute classic) to the drug anthem \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" (\\"'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all you do... yeah!\\" to the \\"Kashmir\\"-esque meanderings of \\"Planet Caravan\\" to the first line of the whole album, coming from the deservedly famous \\"War Pigs\\" - \\"Generals gathered in their masses... just like witches in their black masses.\\"<br />However, you don't listen to Black Sabbath for the lyrics. Besides, the lyrics add a certain... well, I wouldn't say \\"charm,\\" because Black Sabbath's about as charming as a battle-axe. But they add something. Nah, you listen to Sabbath for the guitar riffs. You listen to Sabbath because Tony Iommi rules. \\"Iron Man\\" has... what, four or five brilliant guitar riffs to it? And isn't that a nice, big, juicy one (that's what she said! Okay, fun had) on \\"War Pigs?\\" Yes and yes. Ozzy's cool, too. I love his vocals on the title track, a big-deal radio staple that's just as famous as \\"Iron Man.\\" I love that one! It's chuggin' along, and Ozzy's doin' his echoed freaky vocal thing... cool guy, he. Out of his fjordkin' mind, but cool.<br />Ooh, ooh, and then there's the epicness! Epicity? Epic nature? Yeah, we'll go with that. \\"War Pigs\\" is huge, with some timely shifts in both tempo and dynamic, but I think I like the anti-heroin \\"Hand of Doom\\" even better. \\"Hand of Doom\\" is definitely one of my top Sab songs (which isn't a long list, seeing that I've only heard this album and We Sold Our Souls for Rock 'n' Roll). How, oh how, has the world let this song slip under the radar? It's so creepy! I like creepy. Or at least I like creepy songs. I'm not too big on creepy people. \\"Iron Man\\" and the similar \\"Electric Funeral\\" also both have that larger-than-life quality that, if done right, always makes for a great song in my book. (of course, if you blow it you blow it, but Sab succeeds in both places there). The multipart \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" also has it to a degree, though it's hard to call it epic. It's quite funny, though. Yeah, yeah, funny and epic aren't the same thing. Just thought I'd put it out there.<br />One song here I totally dig that a lot of people don't even know is \\"Planet Caravan.\\" It's not heavy at all - it's totally mellow and trippy and groovy and stuff.

I'm pretty sure Geezer was on pot when he wrote the lyrics to EVERY Black Sabbath song.<br />Again, I'm not a big \\"Rat Salad\\" fan, but the rest of the album is totally brilliant, and I'm not even a big metal fan. Out of the few metal albums I've heard (we won't even get into the whole \\"is [Hendrix-Zeppelin-Cream] metal?\\" discussion here, because it's late and I've gotta get to bed - they're all great bands/artists, though, and they definitely did shape the genre), I'd rank this pretty high. I still think Metallica's Master of Puppets edges it out by just the slightest bit.

0810995212|5.0|I just received my copy, and even though I paid too much for it through Bud Plant, I am completely happy with this book.<br /><br />It was interesting to find out that Leyendecker was one of Norman Rockwell's self-proclaimed idols. Rockwell modeled his work on that of the now little-known J.C. Leyendecker.<br /><br />It is also fascinating to learn that the strong handsome men that Leyendecker portrayed were modeled after his gay lover, Charles Beech. Today, Leyendecker's painting are highly sought after in the gay community.<br /><br />It is ironic that a whole generation of Americans looked at a gay man as a model of youthful strength and good looks. When will we recognize the contributions of gays and lesbians to our society? Without them, our world would be in black and white, rather in color.<br /><br />The \\"Leyendecker look\\" was that of a handsome, sophisticated, young man of the roaring twenties. Many of the men looked like our vision of the \\"Great Gatsby.\\"<br /><br />Many of the illustrations were for \\"Arrow Shirts\\" and were the first examples of brand advertising.<br /><br />Having never encountered Leyendecker's work, I was pleasantly surprised at my discovery.

0061537934|5.0|I was drawn to this book, like others, because of the fact that the narrator was a dog. I was hesitant at first - either that device can work really well or really bad. But I wasn't disappointed. I checked it out from the library to see if I would like it and this book is one that I plan to add to my own personal library.    Enzo (the dog) lives with a race car driver and tells about his life with him. I love the perspective of a dog in this book and it made me wonder if our animals really look at us that way.     Be forewarned - it was a tearjerker, but don't let that scare you away. It was a wonderful story. And if you aren't a fan of racing, don't let that scare you off either. It's apart of the story, but not so much so that a non-fan would be turned off by it.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The Star Wars Trilogy is one of the most amazing 3 picture films in the history of cinema. I'd like to see them in their theatrical releases with state-of-the-art picture and sound quality. No laserdisc masters. I want to see George Lucas undo what he did. Yes, correct the big error he made to his films with a large eraser!    These films were treated poorly over the years starting with 1997s Special Editions and the 2004 DVD release. They do not need tweaking. Why fix something that so many fans love?  I'm not against the changes, but I hate not having a choice. I want the choice to choose which version I want to see. I'm not interested in upgrading Star Wars until these versions see the light. That's just my two cents.

Not only is it heart-warming and intriguing, but it also encapsulates a certain essence that makes it comparable to classic sci-fi (like the works of Isaac Asimov, whose works is a basis for this film).  Some people may find this kind of thing boring.  But for most serious sci-fi fans (and perhaps comedy fans), it is quite worthwhile.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|I hate to admit it, but I missed SG-1 when it originally aired on TV, whether on Showtime or Sci-fi Channel. Due to recent back surgery, I decided to buy season 1 from iTunes, and immediately fell in love with it. Once I finished that season, I could not see spending $40 on a low quality digital version of season 2 when I could buy it brand new on DVD here for $25. And I have decided to go back and purchase season 1 from here, as well as seasons 3 through 10, to have it in higher quality.    If you have not seen this series, it is good, solid story-telling. No, it will not win any Earth-moving awards, but it will keep you going while telling a good sci-fi story set in the modern day with current technology.    I cannot recommend this series and these DVDs highly enough.
B0018CWEYY|1.0|OK... I was waiting for answers and all I got was more questions!! and I agree totally with the reviwer that said that the whole purpose of the show now seems to be to see how many loose ends can the show create without explaing them!!  I mean it seems like the writers actually forget what happened in episodes from earlier seasons and act as if these episodes never took place. Things dont even make anysense anymore.. and the worst thing is trying to invoke science fiction that is totally unscientific.  I am a physicist and I am hugly insulted by the shows failed attempt to involve physics in reasoning (if it can even be called reasoning). the writers have no idea whatsoever what science fiction means.   So in short this season is complete nonesense and it shows clearly that the writers have no clue where things are doing. they just wake up in the morning deciding (ok.. lets make the sun rise from the west today on the island.. cause its a SPECIAL island and we dont need to worry at all about explaing the phenomina cause the stupid veiwers will be awaed by any nonsense we spit on paper)  So save ur time and brain for better things. As for me this will be the last lost season I watch cause i respect my own intelligance.
B000002OTL|4.0|It makes sense that when Tarantino was in the grips of his creative writing peak, this unusually attuned song selector would be at his best as well. Stringing together this unusual mix mainly contrasting R&B with Surf but certainly throwing in other classic genre nods as well, Pulp Fiction's distinct sequencing still stands out as one of the hippest soundtracks to emerge.

It was awesome to see Charles Lee Ray transfer his evil soul into a harmless children's toy. If you don't know the story, I'll spin it for you; Charles Lee Ray is close to death because of Detective Mike Norris, but he finds a Good Guy doll, and says a chant and his soul goes into the doll. The nexy day, it's Andy Barclay's birthday and he desperately wants a Good Guy doll. His smokin' hot mom, Karen gets him one, and it happens to be possessed by Chucky. Detectives show up when Andy's aunt falls out of the window. Andy tries to tell his mom and Norris that Chucky did it, but no one believes him. After Chucky kills his old partner and Andy is placed in an asylum, Karen tries to get Chucky to talk, he finally comes to life, and Karen nearly survives. She needs Norris to believe, but he doesn't until Chucky tries to kill him in the car. Karen and Norris later find out that Chucky needs to transfer his soul into Andy if he wants to be human again. Karen and Norris must stop Chucky and kill him before he tries to become human again. If you love horror, and dolls, you'll love CHILD'S PLAY!!!
0316113506|5.0|Dr. Ratey always has the ability to bring science and practical wisdom together into big ah-ha moments.  (I loved his book \\"Shadow Syndromes.\\") Funny, and sad, how we have gotten so far from what our bodies were designed to do - move, exercise, dance, swim, skate, walk, run, skip, play, learn and practice a skill or sport.       Exercise is that crucial missing piece that we all think is something we have no time for in our schedule, today, as if it were a luxury. But Ratey explains exactly why we have to discover that time.  Exercise, or the lack of it, affects success in school, at work and in life, and contributes to an overall sense of satisfaction and pleasure.  It's not just about the body.  It's about the brain.     We need exercise to activate those dopamine neurons in the reward center of the brain. (P.142)  The fact that we have a reward area in the brain, is absolutely fascinating to me. Working with ADHD adults, I have had the opportunity to observe the proof of exactly what this book explores.  Those adults who exercise, who find new ways to MOVE and do so in a ways that appeal to them  - find more contentment, satisfaction and success.     \\"Spark\\" certainly creates a mandate for what is lacking in our educational system and in our country's future.  If we don't truly get the role that exercise plays, if we can't see the simple science of it all, where are we headed?  You know, there is a lot of hope in this book, if only we could share it with all those who design programs for children.       So, get up and move!

B000KKPN5C|5.0|If you want to really improve your indoor photography, then an external flash is the best accessory you can buy!  The SB-400 is great.  It is small enough that it doesnt look out of place on the D40, D60 size cameras.  It lets you fire the flash up and bounce it off the ceiling for a much better look in your pictures.    The only thing you need to go along with this flash is a good set of rechargeable batteries.  It takes 2, and they last a good bit, but I wouldn't want to be putting alkaline or non-rechargeable batteries in it.    Its great overall.  I never shoot indoors without it.
B00003CXA3|3.0|First the good news: Fox has done a great job mastering this dvd as both the picture and sound quality are very good having been given the THX Dolby Digital 5.1 treatment.  The second disc also has very interesting true documentaries about the original Doyle and Grasso, the former actually having a role in the movie.  I thought the camerawork was very, very good though with excellent play with lighting especially in the late night stake out scenes.  The car chase scene was also very good too.  This next point can also be construed as a negative but the film tried very hard to stay true to the events as they actually happened.<br /><br />Now the not so good news: this film doesn't age very well as is typical with movies from the 70s the story takes a while to develop and in this case, the movie is shot like a documentary too.  This means that for young movie-goers of today, this film will very likely bore you for the most part.  In keeping as close to actual events as possible, the ending had to be lame with the criminal actually getting away.  Overall, this is a good police movie if you have the patience to sit through the slow unfolding of it and quite frankly I cannot understand how this film won the Oscar for the Best Picture, Actor and Director when clearly another film that actually has aged a whole lot better and is certainly much more interesting that year should have won those three categories: \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  Now that was truly film that was ahead of its time and Stanley Kubrick is on another planet when it comes to directing as compared to Friedkin.  Another negative point is the fact that Fox has done it yet again in trying to get you to pay more than is necessary for this by putting on two discs when they could have put on one just to get you to pay more.  They did the same thing with \\"M*A*S*H.<br /><br />Entertaining? Yes, if you have the patience. Best Film of the year? Certainly not.  Ages well for today's audience? Nope.  Good quality sound and picture?  Definitely.  Now you decide if you still wanna get this.nitely.  Now you decide if you still wanna get this.
B000002LMK|5.0|I've been a Neil Young fan since I was little, my Uncle gave me my first album of Neil's which was Decade..and I was hooked by his music, how he could switch from beautiful country tinged folk to in your face loud guitar rock and roll. Ragged Glory was released in September of 1990 and I was almost 13 years old when I first picked it up on cassette. This is one of his most rocking albums in his long career. Tracks like F**kin Up, Love To Burn, Love and Only Love have Neil and Crazy Horse just tearing it up. On Mansion on the Hill, there's sing along hooks and beautiful backing vocals from the band. I really love this entire album with all it's energy and rock, an essential album from a vital figure in rock history.

People saying that the Joker was just another phsycho Pay closer attention to the movie and understand what youre talking about before giving it a one star.

B000TEUCFA|1.0|Too bad there is not a way to hear a sample of the cuts without viewing that long and wandering video.  What happened Amazon?    OK, let me make it simple for you:  No sample to hear, no sale!
0061128562|3.0|The book was too small.  I wanted the regular size book which I had to go to a local retailer to get one due to its out-of-date production that Amazon does not carry.  They should because this is a classic children's book.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|After seeing the movie, had to get the soundtrack.  It is great.  Reasonably priced.  Listen to it all the time.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|If you already own the trilogy, this Blu-ray version is not an improvement.  Most of the movie is extremely grainy - you will notice very little difference over regular DVD. To be fair, though, strangely, some scenes are definitely HD.  Also, unless you have upgraded your sound system to TrueHD, you can forget about having digital sound in English. This disc does not play DTS or Digital 5.1 in English.  However, DTS is available in French or Spanish - if you happen to prefer the international theater experience.  It's not clear what the folks at Paramount were thinking here. VERY Disappointing!    Don't be fooled by comments indicating \\"that's the way old films are supposed to look\\" - 35mm film is capable of capturing far more detail than your HD/1080p TV can reproduce, so depending on the condition of the \\"master\\" film stock, there's no reason this film should not look great in HD.  Need proof? Check out \\"Grand Prix\\" starring James Garner (i have in HD-DVD), filmed in 1964, and released '66.  Picture will leave you breathless - looks like it was filmed in HD - a perfect showcase for your HD theater.  There are plenty of grainy, nostalgic-looking versions of Godfather out there, including the old VHS versions.  The blu-ray version is not worth the $60-80 upgrade.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|Coming into Speed Racer, I had very low expectations for the film. I hated the cartoon, it looked a bit childish, and the Wachowski siblings helmed it. What could go wrong? Well, plenty does go wrong, but plenty goes right. Granted, most of these moments have nothing to do with the filmakers and lay solely in the CGI department, but I was surprised with this film, in a good way.<br /><br />This film is a true roller-coaster in more than ways than one. Quality-wise, it goes from interesting, to bad to just plain stupid, which it stays at for awhile. Then when Speed Racer agrees to run the forbidden death race, the film starts taking an uphill turn, going from bad, to just so bad, it's good. I mean, the Ninja scene will cause you to laugh out loud, but not because it's funny, but because it's just SO bad.<br /><br />It's when the death race really starts going where the visuals start carrying the movie. The crashes, the environments, the action, the falls and drops all contribute the movie's jaw-droppingly amazing visuals. Several moments produced a verbal 'Wow' for me, making this a must to at least see once in HD. Then in-between races, the movie starts coming together, for most part becoming a good to great movie, depending on what moment you're at. The final race brings the movie all together and really makes it worthwhile, for the most part.<br /><br />Where does the movie go wrong besides the absurdity and stupidity of many \\"serious\\" scenes written by the Wachowski siblings? Chiefly, the movie tries to hard to appeal to everybody. It doesn't really strike me as a kid's movie, mainly because of the action, story and visuals will fly over most youngsters heads, but yet, Speed's younger brother and chimp way overstay their welcome. It's a bit cute at the beginning, but then they start cutting into the good stuff. You're then forced to go between the more intense races and fights as such, only to be broken up by the antics of the overly childish duo. I mean, there's kid friendly, then there's stupid. They fall mostly into the latter category.<br /><br />The acting is decent overall, everybody does good with their roles, especially Cristina Ricci, and Matthew Fox does the best with what he's given. However, the movie makes a grave casting error. The role of the evil & cheesy corporate giant Royalton should have been filled by Tim Curry. I mean the no-name who does it in the movie played the character like he was Tim Curry. He sounded like Tim Curry, he acted like Tim Curry, and Tim Curry would have been brilliant in the role, because it was perfect and made for him. Sure it was small, but it bugged me throughout the WHOLE movie.<br /><br />Overall, Speed Racer greatly surprised me, although my fears were both confirmed then denied. It's a whirl-wind of a movie that could have been done better without the Wachowskis, and with a lot of editing, since the film clocks in at over 2 hours. There's lot to love and hate, with most of the love coming from the visual effects department. What's weired is, I actually wouldn't mind a sequel. But like that's ever going to happen!<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5e's stupid. They fall mostly into the latter category.

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn was a huge disappointment. The book started to feel off from the one-chapter-only wedding. I thought the whole huge affair would be at least the first 400 pages. But instead, that space particularly reserved in my mind, for the wedding and the honeymoon, was taken up by a completely unprecedented (at least by me) pregnancy. I was so sure that vampires couldn't have kids. My friend and I were even joking about how Bella would go off and have mutant vampire children. It was only funny because we knew male vampires couldn't produce sperm. I was already feeling annoyed towards Edward for being so mopey after bruising Bella, and the pregnancy just killed me. It seemed like a lousy sci-fi plot stolen off some fan-fic website. Bella never fit into my likely-to-be-a-good-mother radar, and her masochism and extreme dedication during the pregnancy made me feel almost sick.    Then Renesme herself. She was too perfect, the magic solution to everyone's problems. Plus she got my imaginary boyfriend. And what about all the pain she caused Bella? Edward ignored it when he heard her thoughts, Bella, in her masochistic way, never cared if Renesme injured her. Jacob, who was the only real character for me until he imprinted, forgot about how much agony Renesme had caused Bella when he fell out of love with Bella and imprinted on Renesme. All because she's a sweet, perfect, lovable baby.     And then Jacob's imprinting. This made me so upset. The pedophilia so grossly implied greatly disturbed me. Jacob...my one true love, was my favorite Bella's son-in-law? I wanted to scream. And I loved Jacob's book so much. It was a breath of fresh, realistic air. And I was dying for Jacob and Leah to fall in love. They would have made the perfect couple, and it seemed as though SM was setting them up, with their rivalry. Then he falls in love with Renesme.     Also, the \\"fight\\" with the Volturi. It was incredibly anti-climatic. The last 400 pages were spent building up to what was anticipated to be a huge fight, with deaths all around. And I was so looking forward to Jane and Aro getting their pretty little butts kicked. Then everyone stood around and talked for 50 pages. J. Jenks became a total page filler. Bella became a magical shield that blocked everything. And about 10 new vampire clans popped up out of nowhere, and they were all tossed together like a bucket of action figures, with the same outfits and talents.    The Bella and Edward relationship was totally ruined, both by Bella becoming a vampire, by B&E being so horny, and Renesme. It was all about sex and parenthood, and totally killed the spark. Emmet's sex jokes were just an attempt by SM to break the monotony of sex and Renesme.    And sacrifice. That was the last aspect of Breaking Dawn that totally ruined it for me. For the first three books, SM made very clear how important sacrifice is. The \\"splintering of Bella's heart\\" was so tender and heartfelt I almost cried. Bella went into marriage with Edward knowing, and expecting to give up so much: Jacob, her friends, Charlie, Renee...yet in the end, Bella got everything. Jacob imprinting on Renemse, making him a part of the Cullen family forever. Charlie watching Jacob phase and realizing that his daughter was a part of the supernatural, accepting that fact, and welcoming her and Renesme with open arms. Bella gets money, too. Lots of it. And she doesn't have to do a thing.    These books lost almost everything for me, just from Breaking Dawn.    On a happier note: My one laugh-aloud moment in Breaking Dawn that still gave the book a tiny bit of face was the arm-wrestling match between Emmett and Bella. It was hilarious.  I really needed that.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. As for it's Blu-Ray value, it's a must-own. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!h is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.

0061537934|5.0|This is a wonderful story whether you're a dog person or not. But it's especially meaningful if you've ever been adored by a dog like I have because you will understand and accept the deep bond between Enzo and Denny. It's Enzo's story to tell and quite simply, he adores Denny and the life he has with his family, and it's apparent in everything he does. Sometimes the story seems contrived but as a dog owner, I often think my own dogs express humanity, that they have a human 'voice\\", think human thoughts and would do human things if they just had those opposable thumbs.     Most of the story is about Denny's life, most of it rather tragic and rough, as observed by Enzo. The other characters - his wife Eve, daughter Zoe and his in-laws - are all superficial plot lines that allow Enzo to observe how other people interact with Denny. But in Enzo's center, it's always about Denny.     There's sadness from the beginning because you know that Enzo is dying so he deserves to tell HIS story HIS way. Enzo is satisfied that he lived a good life, one deserving of reincarnation to the next life which he fervently hopes is as a man. It's wonderful to believe that dogs can aspire to be more than what they are and this story makes you believe it's possible.     Keep tissues nearby. And read it with your dog.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This is the best thing Jethro Tull ever did, and it's also my all-time favorite album. You might say it's pretentious except that pretension implies unfulfilled ambition. You'll find none of that here; Tull deliver heroically on every level. ELP, Yes, and most of the other prog bands were pretentious. They sounded silly sometimes because they took themselves really seriously. I think it's funny how those bands, whose members were often classically trained, tried so hard to be sophisticated and profound, and then Ian Anderson, a blues flute player with no musical education at all, beat them at their own game while making fun of them at the same time. Tull had a sense of humor about progressive rock which, combined with their overall superior musicianship, resulted in success where others would have made fools of themselves. With Thick as a Brick the spoof surpassed the spoofed.
0061537934|5.0|If you only read one book this year, make it The Art of Racing in the Rain. I can't recall ever having read a book like this one. I noticed the book while at the cash register at Barnes & Noble; the cashier strongly suggested I read the book, and I'm so glad she did!!    This novel is narrated by a very intelligent canine, Enzo, who tells the tale of a few very difficult years in the life of his master, Denny, who is a race car driver. Enzo does the best he can to support and protect his family during a difficult time, and imparts to the reader life lessons gleaned from racing, a passion he shares with Denny.    It is a page-turner, and you'll be teary at the end; both because of the story itself, and the fact that the book is over!    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00197X140|5.0|This album really should not be as good as it is.  Basically it is womwhat of a greatest hits album, except that the songs were rerecorded and in some cases rearranged.  Most bands who attempt this don't produce anything memorable.  Anathema, on the other hand, are such immense songwriters but didn't necessarily always put their work in the best light.  The original recording of Angelica for instance, was poorly recorded at a time when Cavanagh really had not found his singing voice yet (he made a drastic improvement between \\"Eternity\\" and \\"Alternative 4\\"), here this gorgeaous song is finally done justice.  This album works because the songs are all extraordinarily strong.  They are not simply good, many of them could be called great, and I would only say this about very few songs that I like.  Anathema's songs have a classic, timeless beauty to them.  By picking some of their strongest works and recording them in a way that makes them flow together seamlessly, Anathema have produced what could possibly be considered their best album.  I would highly receommend this to anyone, and if I had to introduce this band to someone this would definitely be the best starting point (unless that person is a doom metal fan of course).
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This movie wasn't bad. Sly is getting old; he had some fat on him in this film. It was said in the commentary that Sly wanted the boxing match to be realistic and not cinematic. That's why Mike Tyson was in the film. A couple of famous HBO Boxing Ring Announcers, such as Jim Lampley and Max Kellerman, hosted the fight.  It's too bad that Adrian was dead. Rocky and Paulie got in an arguement over Rocky's memories of love with Adrian. Rocky manages a restaurant call Adrian's. There's a sports cast comparing Rocky to the current champ Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon. The movie basically gives a reason why the two should fight and the movie ends with a happy ending. Rocky tells the champ \\" It's not over until it's over.\\" It's fun watching Rocky train and this time he lifts weights heavier than I've ever seen him lift before. At the end of the fight, Rocky was bloody and beat up and everyone was yelling \\"Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!\\" Fortunately Rocky didn't become champ again because he's too old but Rocky went the distance.
B0002KPIQY|2.0|Essentially this is a movie about one of many models chewed up and spit out by the fashion industry.  With all the reviews written about the plot I'll skip to the review.    The intro to this 1998 HBO TV movie says that Gia Carangi \\"In the early eighties...became a legend in the fashion industry.\\"      In real life, she is barely a footnote in the fashion industry.  Michale Gross, in his 1995 book \\"Model,\\" the most exhaustive and exhausting of all books on the fashion industry dismisses her as \\"a bisexual drug abuser who had a short but visible career.\\"      As you can quickly tell from the sole opening credit (Angelina Jolie, of course) this movie is an Angelina Jolie vehicle.  The problem is that this vehicle sputters throughout due to overwrought dialogue and acting which ties nicely back into the overwrought intro.     With her post-lip, pre-nose job plastic surgery Angelina Jolie looks remarkably similar to Katie Holmes at certain angles.    This type of movie-making reminds one of the old gangster movies of the '30's and '40's.  It purports to be a warning of the dangers of its subject while maximally exploiting it; in this case with nudity instead of guns.       The two hour length of the movie is more tortuous than Angelina's death scenes.      Two stars, one for each attractive boob, real or not.

B000008H24|5.0|War Child might have some people believing this where Jethro Tull started to fall apart for a short period with the songwriting before picking up the pace again a short time later.  Or, people believe \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" is the only worthwhile song.  Not true either way.    Instead it's a very good album that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Aqualung, Stand Up, Thick as a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery and Heavy Horses.    The title song features an oddly pleasant chorus, \\"Sealion\\" has some comical, yet entirely memorable, lyrics, \\"Skating Away\\" puts images in my head of someone, you guessed it- SKATING AWAY, haha.  Jethro Tull always had a winter-like theme going on, at least it sounds that way to me.  Perfect snowstorm weather!  \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" has a beautiful sound and lyrics you wanna sing along to no matter how old you are, and \\"The Third Hoorah\\" is a happy dance song that's about as catchy as a pop song can be.  All in all, worth buying.    Oh, and looking at the album cover quickly, it looks like something Judas Priest would do!

B000002UA5|5.0|The studio album of Ummagumma is VERY underappreciated.    The \\"Sysyphus\\" suite is quite ununual the way it begins with a rather dark and intimidating riff that leads into an Emerson, Lake and Palmer piano melody.  It's a peaceful and beautiful melody, that stays consistently good for the most part, until it reaches a point where two notes keep rambling back and forth, then the piano playing gets all messy for a minute or so.  Not as good as the stuff ELP would do a few years later, but decent enough.      The third part features WEIRD monkey sound effects with jungle-like sounds, and the fourth and final part is absolutely AWESOME because it has an eerie mellotron melody with soft sprinkles of keyboards building slowly, and cautiously, into a loud and intense theme until eventually going back to the intimidating riff that started the whole thing.   The fourth part of this suite is really really good though, especially the eerie few minutes that begins the thing, which would work extremely well in a horror film.    \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" features nice acoustic guitar (I think?) and closely resembles \\"Wish You Were Here\\" in the vocals.  I wasn't expecting to hear such a mature song on this album going by all the other reviews.  \\"Several Small Species\\" is a MAJOR head trip, that's for sure!  It's totally unique and needs to be appreciated on that level to fully understand.    \\"The Narrow Way\\" is the highlight of the album for me.  Part One has EXCELLENT acoustic guitar, melodic and emotionally touching, and the second part features a Black Sabbath-like guitar riff for a few minutes, before the final part comes in, which sounds like something that would fit in PERFECTLY with the Dark Side of the Moon album.  I don't understand people who say Meddle shows signs of what Pink Floyd would sound like later, when this song obviously shows what the band would become just a few years later.    \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" is the only weak point- radical drumming that doesn't go anywhere, and goes on too long.  The rest of the album though, is quite fantastic.  I don't get the negative reviews for this one I'm afraid.    The live album of Ummagumma (which by the way, sounds like a tasty kind of Halloween snack!) isn't NEARLY as good as people have been telling me.  What IS really great however, is the opening song \\"Astronomy Domine\\", which has an AWESOME space rock jam in the middle that sounds like it probably influenced several bands such as Hawkwind.  The jam just feels so natural, like the vocals needed that jam all along in order to complete a perfect song.    \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\" is another great song.  The slow keyboard melody in the beginning that builds into these soothing vocals that sail and soar to new heights... Pink Floyd was really good at this.  The song gets noisy after a while, but in an appealing kind of way, where you don't want it to stop.  Great song.    Then the album loses steam super fast.  \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" was better on Saucerful of Secrets, because it had a Moody Blues-like vibe flowing through it.  Here, the song tries to be something more, and just ends up being a boring song.  This version of \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" is overrated BIG time.  Everyone says it's better than the version from the studio album of the same name, but it's not.  The studio version had these rather unique sound effects, muddy production, and a spooky atmosphere to help make it one of the creepiest songs ever.  This version is just loud, and repeats the same notes for several minutes.  Not good to me.  Yes, I know the studio version repeats a lot too, but that version had sound effects that seemed to add more atmosphere to the song, so it was easy to avoid the parts that repeated a lot.    Still, the album gets 5 stars for the studio stuff, which rules.

6305327041|3.0|Four Rooms is an anthology film with segments directed by Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino. What links the four films together is Ted the Bellhop (Tim Roth). His first night happens to be New Year's Eve and the hotel guests make sure that it is one wild celebration that Ted will never forget. The first film entitled \\"The Missing Ingredient\\" is directed by Anders and stars Madonna, Lili Taylor, Alicia Witt, Valeria Golino, and Ione Skye. They are a coven of witches who plan on bringing one of their own back to life. Each witch is responsible for bringing one essential ingredient for the spell  to work. Some of the ingredients include breast milk, and virgin's blood. The Skye character is the only one who doesn't have her specific ingredient. In order to get it she's  going to need a little assistance and that is where Ted comes in. He's the only person who can give her what she needs, so it falls on her to seduce him while the other witches wait outside. The Missing Ingredient in this film for me was Ione Skye's top. I'm not complaining since this short film sets the tone for what's  to come. The second film, and most boring, is directed by Rockwell and entitled \\"The Wrong Man\\". Jennifer Beals stars as a wife who finds herself tied to a chair and being held at gunpoint by her jealous husband who thinks she's  sleeping with Ted. Beals has some funny lines about Ted's member which cause Ted and her husband Siegfried (David Proval) to turn red with embarrassment. This one didn't play as well as the other ones and kinda slowed the film down. Rodriguez and Tarantino are the closers as Rodriguez directs the third film \\"The Misbehavers\\". It's kind of like his Spy Kids movies and even has Antonio Banderas. Banderas and his wife are going out to a New Year's Eve party and they hire Ted to look after their two rambunctious kids. He is to have them in bed before midnight. Sleeping is the last thing on the kids' mind since the boy is too busy watching a bikini clad chick (Salma Hayek) dancing on T.V. and the young girl is horrified to discover  used needles and the decaying body of a prostitute under the mattress. Not surprisingly Tarantino's film \\"The Man from Hollywood\\" is the longest one. It is a remake of an old \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" episode. Tarantino stars along with  Paul Calderon, an uncredited Bruce Willis, and a barefoot Jennifer Beals. If you can't stand watching the Q.T. try to act this one might be painful for you as he casts himself as the hottest young director in Hollywood. He's  just bet one of his drunk friends his Cadillac De Ville if a lighter doesn't light. Let me explain. On the Hitchcock episode a man bets that he can light an old lighter x amount of times in a row before the flame goes out. If he succeeds he gets the car, if he doesn't he has to chop off one of his fingers. Truth be told Tarantino's acting isn't that embarrassing and this segment is a lot of fun. It isn't hard to see why this film is a cult classic since there are enough odd and darkly funny moments that will keep you guessing. It's also a nice reminder of when Miramax and Tarantino were the biggest and most successful names in Independent Cinema.

The Instant Gratification Generation needs everything explained to them and on top of that they want ALL the facts spoon fed to them.  If that's what you're looking for, Cloverfield is not your movie.  This film is deeper than most dramas, more suspenseful than most thrillers, and better than any recent monster type film.  I have to admit, while stylistically perfect for the film, I grew tired of the shaky camera work.  That is probably the only reason I won't watch this film twice...at least not for a while.  This film is creepy the way all good horror/monster films should be.  It harkens back to a day when simple elements of light (a la Creature From The Black Lagoon) create suspense.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

075640407X|4.0|First, let me say that this book was a welcome surprise. I had problems in the beginning, it started off way too slow for my taste and it seemed to jump all over the place without showing me any real reason for it.  I kept starting, losing interest, stopping and then forcing myself to trudge on.  The various scenes without explanation in the beginning were initially annoying.  The reason for this, I now realize, is that it is an intricately woven plot and all of these seemingly inconsequential pieces mattered in the end.  I was well over 100 pages into the book before it got really interesting for me.  Once it got started, there was no letup.  I couldn't put it down, it was as though I were compelled to read it every waking moment.    Rothfuss does an excellent job of character building in this book.  Because he has taken the time to show his readers Kvothe's struggles growing up and all of the circumstances that he endured, the audience is able to really know the character. [SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD] Is Kvothe a little over-hyped? Yes, I agree that he seems slightly too good; however, given the circumstances of his childhood (again, kudos to the author for sharing that) it is believable that he would be a fast thinker (to survive in the streets you must be fast), an excellent musician (alone for months with nothing but your instrument - of course you would excel), and good at the magic (having a personal one-on-one tutor while traveling with his troupe could have given him an edge).  That being said, the current state of his magic (when the story flashes to the present) shows that he is flawed. [END OF SPOILER SECTION]    It has been a long time since I've been this pulled into a story. Except for the lengthy, wordy beginning, I enjoyed the book and I look forward to learning more about the characters in the upcoming novels.     Anyone reading this book is in for a real treat.

B0000026NC|5.0|What am I saying?<br />Yes, On the Turning Away done live on this album is without question the summit of great lead guitar work.  Gilmour bleeds his Strat and blends it with power chords that weaken the knees.  Best lead guitar song ever recorded.  Stack it against any, and I mean any, guitar solo.  There seems to be a \\"how fast can he play?\\" or \\"how complicated can he get?\\" mentality in music in the past decades.  On the Turning Away is hard evidence that quality and craftmanship cannot be rushed.  Gilmour was voted Number 1 Guitarist of All Time in a UK Billboard poll a couple of years ago.  Here is the proof.  It is PURE MAGIC.
0440237688|5.0|Lois Lowry's The Giver has just made my top-ten list of favorite books.  Although I am a senior in college, this is the first time I have ever delved into the intriguing world of The Giver, and I found it fascinating.   The story revolves around a young boy named Jonas.  Jonas has grown up in a supposedly perfect society where no one experiences pain or suffering and no one has to make their own choices.  Everything about their lives is carefully controlled, from how they wear their hair, to their jobs within the community and their assigned spouses.  At the beginning of the book, Jonas is about to become a twelve and receive his assignment within the community.  Jonas learns that he has been selected to be the new receiver of memories.  The giver is the man who currently holds those memories, and he begins to give some of those memories to Jonas.  As Jonas receives these memories, he learns of a long forgotten world, a world full of pain, full of sorrow, full of color, full of joy and full of love.  It is as he begins to learn about things such as sunshine, war, holidays, and family that he begins to realize what is missing from the society he lives in--depth of feeling and the ability to make choices for oneself.  Jonas struggles as he tries to adjust his new knowledge in to the perfectly ordered society that he lives in.  And the more he thinks about how things were, and how they could be, the more he begins to wonder if things can change.   I gave this book five stars for two reasons.  Number one, as a life-long lover of books, I particularly enjoy reading a story that is very unique, even for its genre.  Although one could argue that The Giver is similar to other dystopian novels such as 1984 or Anthem, I thought that Lowry's approach was quite original. The second reason that I loved this book is because it was thought provoking.  It truly made me ponder the importance of choice, the necessity of experiencing pain and sorrow to understand true joy, and the significance of feeling and being loved.  Unlike other dystopian novels, this book didn't seem to be a political statement or a warning of what society could become, but rather just a story that raises questions about what is most important, and what a perfect society truly is.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|If there were more stars I would give it more.   It is a little hard to understand but if you stick with it, it will begin to fall into place.    I wish there were more British mysteries like this.   I highly recommend it for something different.
B001F12J3Y|5.0|Disclaimer:  This is really a preview of the movie, since I don't have the 3D blue-ray version in my possession at the time, but I definitely pre-ordered it!    [Disclaimer 2:  Okay, months after I ordered and watched this movie, I suppose I should update my preview into a real review, huh?  Stuff in Brackets are new info, for the sake of preservation of the original preview.  -MT 05/22/09]    For those who do not know, the Polar Express is based on a book by Caldecot Award winner Chris Van Allsburg of the same title ([[ASIN:0618477977 The Polar Express Gift Set]]), a story told me about ten years ago.  Excellent book, btw, and you should consider buying it.    When the movie came out, it was released as a regular movie, and then as a IMAX 3D movie.  The regular movie was well-received, but the 3D movie was very excellently received.  I've seen both, and I can tell you that the moving train scenes and the falling snow scenes being seen in 3D is already enough to see the 3D version exclusively.  In my opinion, seeing the 3D version and then seeing the 2D version is like watching a movie in color, and then seeing it again in only black and white.  It did so well that the movie was shown in many IMAX theaters during Christmas for another 2 years.    Therefore, when the movie was first released in 2D only, I decided that I could not buy it, since to me, it was the stripped down version.  When I bought a PS3, I still did not buy the Blu-Ray version, since the higher resolution was an improvement, but without 3D, it still wasn't worth it.  Now, however, Warner Bros. is finally willing to release the movie in 3D and 3D Blu-Ray.    Therefore, you have 4 versions (plus the full screen version, but that's definitely not under consideration):  2D low def ([[ASIN:B000AGTPUK The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)]])  2D high def (Blu-Ray [[ASIN:B000Q7ZO8U The Polar Express [Blu-ray]]] and HD-DVD [[ASIN:B000I2JKCO The Polar Express [HD DVD]]])  3D low def ([[ASIN:B000Q7ZO8U The Polar Express [Blu-ray]]])  3D high-def Blu-Ray (this version, although it's also released in HD-DVD)  If you have a Blu-Ray player, you really need to buy this one.  If you are unlucky and do not, get the 3D low-def version.  If you somehow have a HD-DVD player, you're out of luck, sorry.    Again, an excellent story, an excellent movie, and the 3D version is excellent.    Highly, highly recommended.    [updated 05/22/09:  While I still highly recommend this version, I now have to caution you about the 3D effect.  Don't know if it's because of me (I use glasses, and unlike the theater experience, fitting the paper frame 3D glasses in front of or behind my regular glasses isn't as good as fitting the theater 3D glasses over them), but the 3D effect wasn't great for me.  Because home 3D uses tinting as opposed to theater which uses polarized glasses, the 3D image is a lot darker.  For movies like Spy Kids 3D ([[ASIN:B0000TG9ZG Spy Kids 3-D Game Over (Two-Disc Collector's Series)]]), this darkening isn't so noticeable, but in The Polar Express, because you see so much white snow, the 3D effect makes the snow off-white, with the colors occassionally turning greenish or reddish if either side of your glasses/eye dominates temporarily.  There are also enough night scenes that the darkening effect makes those scenes hard to make out, and you basically waste your blu-ray definition.    So, why do I still recommend this version?  Let's remember, this movie is still a great movie, still a great story, and the lack of technology makes this story relevant for years and decades to come.  And the resolution in the 2D version is still great, since it's still in blu-ray 1080P.  And the price difference between this one and the 2D blu-ray version is a buck or 2.  So, for this small difference in price, you get the option of 3D, without losing anything.  Yes, you can turn off 3D at the beginning, as well as swap between 2D and 3D in the middle of the movie.  And this will allow yourkids (with presumably better eyesight), to experience the 3D version at least once.    Oh, and a person asked in the comments section if this includes 3D glasses.  Yes, 4 pairs, with the paper frames.    So, there you have it, my updated preview turned into an authentic review.  Perhaps with the imperfect 3D, I'll knock it down to 4.5 stars, so the rounded value remains 5 stars!  Yay!  -MT, 05/22/09]
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I first knew of \\"The World at War\\" in re-runs through cable TV.  I had seen bits and pieces but never watched any one episode.  When I became interested in studying the Second World War, I decided to purchase this DVD set.<br /><br />To me, what is important in any documentary, is not only the footage of the war itself but also the interviews from people who lived during that particular period.  At the time that this documentary was made, many who lived through the events of the Second World War were still alive in 1974.  The World at War contains a wealth of information through personal interviews given by the politicians of the U.S., and Great Brittan, soldiers from the U.S., Japan, Great Brittan and Germany and the citizens of these countries.  A few who lived through the holocaust were also present to tell their stories.  Even former members of Hitler's S.S. were interviewed as well as Hitler's personal valet and his 22 year old secretary, Traudl Junge.<br /><br />This documentary covers all areas of World War II and contains extensive footage of battles both at home and abroad.<br /><br />The DVD set contained all 26 regular - 50 minute long episodes and 12 hours of bonus material.<br /><br />The bonus material contained two 90 minute programs of \\"Hitler's Final Solution\\", one 90 Minute program of \\"Hitler's Germany\\" and a 45 Minute Interview of Hitler's secretary.  Extended footage of German citizens, soldiers and high ranking officials was also included.  One episode entitled, \\"The Two Deaths of Adolph Hitler\\" interviewed people who were trying to determine if the charred remains that they examined was really that of Adolph Hitler.<br /><br />Many of the interviews in the bonus material, as well as war footage, is repeated from the original episodes but contained additional footage not seen in the regular episodes.  Sir Laurence Olivier narrated the 26 episodes.  Eric Porter narrated some of the bonus material.<br /><br />2 additional programs covering the making of The World at War were also included.<br /><br />For someone wanting a complete and thorough look at all sides of WWII, this DVD set is a must and is suitable for most audiences.For someone wanting a complete and thorough look at all sides of WWII, this DVD set is a must and is suitable for most audiences.
B001EOQWEO|3.0|This is a funny flick. Comedy Central. Who doesn't like the simple sweet robot, the hi-tech sweetheart on a mission, and the pet cockroach who lives in a many year old twinkie. With an added bonus of \\"Hello Dolly\\" undertones??    As for the storyline? It was.... well crappy. Humans go fat, a robot ship wheel (with a plan to keep humans fat, dumb, and happy in space), and gosh its hard just to simplify the crazy. Eventually humans go back to desolate, probably not yet inhabitable earth, and are still barely able to walk. End of movie. Only redeeming features is the wall*e romance sub-plot.

B001G7HKZ4|5.0|I rented this movie off Amazon Video on Demand.  I'd never heard of it before, and since it has no reviews, I thought I'd add my two cents about this film.      This is a good movie, pretty entertaining.  The story takes place in England just prior to the outbreak of World War II.  The plot centers around a woman named Ms. Pettigrew, a vicar's daughter, who gets fired as a governess and is unable to find work.  She goes to a woman at her employment agency, who tells Ms. Pettigrew that she is unreliable and these are tough times, so there is no work for her.      While she is at the employment agency, she overhears agency employees speaking about a position for a woman whose calling card was left on an employee's desk - Delysia Lafosse.  Ms. Pettigrew steals the calling card and goes to Ms. Lafosse's house, pretending that she is the employee the agency sent over.      That is where the story really begins: the vicar's daughter Ms. Pettigrew has some issues at the less-than-virtuous lifestyle of the woman, but cannot leave because she has no options left.      Says Ms. Pettigrew in the film, \\"A little desperation has made me a smoking, swearing accomplice to misdeeds in a den of iniquity!\\"      The story is amusing and entertaining in a quiet British way and would be a good rental.  I don't believe the story is interesting enough to warrant purchasing this movie, you will likely never watch it or think about it ever again.  But it is an amusing enough way to spend an afternoon.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|I bought this set because it contains two performances by the much beloved late Jeremy Brett.  Though I'm happy to say that all four plays, and the fascinating biography on Oscar Wilde are exceptionally well done!  The other reviewer summerized the four productions excellently, so I just wanted to add my two cents.<br /><br />The two Brett plays-The Picture of Dorian Grey, and The Ideal Husband, showcase Mr. Bretts superb acting ability.  He's wonderfully dark and morose in Dorian, but equally light, witty and charming in Ideal.  This set should be in the Library of any Brett aficionado.<br /><br />The other two productions-The Importance of Being Ernest and Lady Windermere's fan, are in many ways even surperior to the other two productions.  Joan Plowright is exceptional in Ernest and proves why she's a Grand Dame of British threatre. The BBC should be applauded for putting these productions on TV as it enables the everyday person, like myself, to see quality theatrical productions when most would not have the means or ability to do so in person.  I hope the BBC brings more plays like these to TV for modern viewers.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this inexpensive, quality set to any period piece fan. 5 stars!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This is probably the best mystery I have read in years.  The background - Stalin's Russia, changing over the years to end in Kruschev's Russia - is perfectly, chillingly drawn. It gives a great but not arty or self-consciously literary sense of the Kafkaesque feel of life in an all- encompassing dictatorship, where the State is all and the individual nothing.      It begins during the famines caused by collectivization, a period rarely (ok, never) dealt with by modern writers. The characters are well-drawn, interesting, and you care what happens to them, particularly the protagonist as he sorts out the moral complexities of his life as an agent of the state.  But it's not a preachy novel: the action moves right along, and it didn't surprise me to read that the movie rights have already been bought.    Highly recommended!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Short and sweet.  REM is back with a vengeance, with this new CD a masterpiece right up there with Automatic for the People. I've seen some of these songs performed live, and they are stunning and creative.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|THIS IS 'NOT' \\"REAL\\" DEATH METAL:<br /><br /> Give me a freaking break: And you hired Robert Trujillo at a million dollars for this? - The CD is selling used on here for $6.98. That should tell you something.<br /> Why would you call your CD Death Magnetic if there is no death metal in it at all, it's too mellow and too commercialized, we old fans have been telling YOU the band for years that YOU stopped being good after 'Master of Puppets' W/ CLIVE BURTON - even a close call came when they did 'And Justice For All' as I liked that followup effort and I'm still influenced by those particular CD's. After that it has all gone downhill, I don't care if it says that they are one of the most influential bands, hell even Slayer is better than this, it doesn't matter if they used Rick Rubin who is Slayer's producer. Slayer is 'real death metal' and they even sound like it. It makes me wonder if Metallica would know real death metal if it kicked them in the hind ends.
B001B71NOI|5.0|If you haven't picked up this album yet, then shame on you. Not only has Trent delivered free music to his millions of minions, but he offers this limited-print version to the die-hard fans who simply can't live without a manufactured copy of his terrific work(i.e. myself).<br />As with all his music, his beautiful melodies melt together with angst-filled rhythms perfectly. He has delivered yet another timeless ballad, 'Lights in the Sky', as well as the lyrical masterpiece, 'Echoplex.' Along with these, though, there is the industrial genius we all know and love, expressing his frustrations through songs like 'Letting You' and 'Demon Seed.'<br />I, personally, love the album and thank Trent for producing an official hard-copy release. I was also extremely excited to see the reunion of Trent and Robyn. Even if you have a 5mbps connection, it's worth the free download. However, I would recommend buying the hard-copy to support the amazing work he has produced.

0312427999|1.0|I'm certainly glad I only read a couple of chapters in the local bookstore as this book is a disgrace. Ms. Klein so distorts the fundamental facts and events to paint a picture that couldn't be any further from the truth. I find it hard to believe that Ms. Klein is taken seriously. I mean, did she actually do any real research for this book? Its difficult to even call it an intellectual rebuttal when she can't get the major concepts correct. Example: Dr. Friedman pointed out Governments use crisis to increase their control over our lives, not relax it as Dr. Friedman advocates. Look at the Great Depression, 9/11, Katrina or even the current financial bailout. Anyone have any evidence to the contrary?  I guess she had to wait until Milton Friedman was dead to publish this trash as she wouldn't have lasted 30 seconds in a debate with him. It's unfortunate that those praising the book either don't understand the concepts what Prof. Friedman preached or have another agenda entirerly.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|When I heard Paul Newman passed away the other day I immediately thought of all the wonderful movies he was a part of, and Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is one of my favorites so I had to watch it again.    So many wonderful scenes and lines that I never get tired of seeing - the jump into the river, Sundance (Redford) asking if he can move when shooting and of course Butch (Newman) trying in his own way to have the train doors open.  Newman and Redford were a perfect pair for this and their back and forth throughout the movie is priceless.    Wonderful acting, direction and cinematography and the extras on the DVD are great.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Read all the other 1-star reviews on the horrible production; it's all true, although I think it's still possible to enjoy the CD even with the awful production. This is still inexcusable. Can't really blame Metallica here; they have years of hearing loss from not wearing earplugs on tour in their youth. They hear buzzing and distortions even without music playing.
1594201749|5.0|This book is an absolute masterpiece of writing, a true gem and one that will certainly melt the hearts of many.  On the surface it is about a rugby match between South Africa's Springboks and New Zealand in 1995.  But it is representative of much more because, as the author shows, this match helped bring together South Africa after the fall of Apartheid, healing, at least in a small way, the anger of the blacks and the fear of the whites that the new nation would reject them.  This was clear when Mandela came to support the rugby team, which had been seen as a symbol of Afrikaner nationalism, wholeheartedly.  The book is more than the game, it covers many important characters and their reactions on the day of the match.  The author is certainly an expert on South Africa, having lived there as a journalist, and he understands the soul of many of the people of the country.  He understands also the history of the Afrikaners, the tradition of the 'Bitter enders' who had fought the british to 'bitter end' in the Boer War.  This is a very nice book, an important story and one that will surely inspire.  Unfortunatly the story paints a perfect utopian pciture of South Africa, one that has not stood the test of time.  With the murder rate the highest in the world, AIDs running wild, farm invasions and the prospect of a new president whose motto used to be 'bring me my machine gun', South Africa's 1995 rugby match may well have just been a moment of reconciliation that could not last.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B001DDBCUU|5.0|Loved this movie, also loved the intro to introduce the characters and where they are now.

B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is considered one of Disney's most artistically beautiful films, and the new Platinum Edition 2 Disc DVD release is a fitting new polishing of the Disney gem. The story is about Princess Aurora, who was cursed as a baby by the evil witch Maleficent due to the fact that she was not invited to the christening. Fated to an eternal sleep upon reaching the age of 16, she is given somewhat of a reprieve by one of the Good Fairies who bestows upon Aurora the blessing of being reawakened by true love's kiss. The 3 Good Fairies (Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna) take Aurora into the woods as a baby and raise her as Briar Rose in order to keep her away from Maleficent, hopefully avoiding the curse in the first place. However, on the crest of her 16th birthday, Aurora happens to meet Prince Phillip and naturally falls in love. Neither knows the true identity of the other and that their kingdoms have already decreed that they marry each other. When she is returned to her parents, the King & Queen, Aurora is upset that she cannot marry her boyfriend from the woods, and instead, must marry a Prince she has not met (as far as she knows). Maleficent finds the Princess and carries out her original curse. Can Prince Philip save the Princess with true love's kiss?<br /><br />The film looks and sounds spectacular. Shot in Super Technirama 70, the widescreen (2.55:1 enhanced for 16x9 TVs) film has been restored using state-of-the-art technology, and will fill up your speakers with its 5.1 enhanced home theater mix. For purists, the restored original theater track is also included. Either way you choose, Mary Costa (the voice of Aurora) sounds incredible. It would be hard to imagine anyone else vocalizing the Princess with such warmth and beauty. Eleanor Audley also deserves kudos for her vocalization of the evil Maleficent. She is definitely one of the most scary and memorable Disney characters.<br /><br />This project was special to Walt; it was the last feature based on a fairy-tale (until 1989's \\"Little Mermaid\\"). Since the studio had already done a similar tale with \\"Snow White,\\" Walt wanted to make it different by adding a classical music inspired Tchaikovsky score and giving the film a less cartoony and more artistic visual representation. Breaking all box-office records, this film succeeded on all levels.<br /><br />And the extras...wow! On Disc One, in addition to the feature, you get:<br /><br />*Music & More: \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" music video performed by Hannah Montana's Emily Osment, who updates the song with a pop rock beat<br /><br />* Disney Song Selection: Instantly access your favorite songs from the movie<br /><br />* Backstage Disney includes audio commentary for the film (John Lasseter, film critic Leonard Maltin, and Disney animator Andreas D&eacute;ja), Princess Fun Facts (pop-up trivia fact option while watching the movie), \\"Grand Canyon\\" short (1959 Oscar winner for best short subject film and features the music of Ferde Grof's \\"Grand Canyon Suite\\"), and The Peter Tchaikovsky Story. The Peter Tchaikovsky story was featured on the 1959 Walt Disney Presents anthology. It was a historic telecast due to the fact that home viewers could listen in true-stereophonic sound, by turning on two additional radios with ABC simulcast of the necessary stereophonic channels. Disney explains the process at the beginning of the featurette. You can choose between this version and the version that replaces Disney's explanation. Although the featurette was first broadcast in black and white, it was shot in color. The remaining color footage is here on this DVD set.<br /><br />* Naturally, there are trailers/promos for other Disney films, including the upcoming theatrical release \\"Princess & The Frog\\" and the next Platinum Edition DVD release, \\"Pinocchio.\\"<br /><br />Extras on Disc 2:<br /><br />Games & Activities:<br />* Briar Rose's Enchanted Dance Game: Learn to Waltz, taking on the role of Princess Aurora or Prince Phillip.<br />* \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" Fun With Language Game. This one is definitely for VERY young children who must identify the most basic of words using visuals from the film.<br /><br />Backstage Disney:<br />* Picture Pefect: The Making Of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" (43:32) A wonderful documentary detailing the making of the movie. Features interviews with animators and Mary Costa, who is still beautiful today. Watching this will definitely enhance your appreciation for this movie as the artistic masterpiece that it is.<br />* Eyvind Earle: The Man and His Art (7:33) is about the man responsible for the artistic backgrounds and overall look of the film. Disney stepped up everyone's game at the animation studio by having Earle oversee the design. Features interviews with Alice Davis and John Canemaker.<br />* Alternate Opening (3:28) is recreated with storyboards and sketches. After viewing this, I'd say they made the right decision, as the music intended for this sequence was more pop-oriented and not fitting the classical Tchaikovsky score.<br />* 3 Deleted Songs<br />* 8 Art Galleries, including visual design, character development, storyboards, publicity, and a detailed look at the Storybook featured in the film's opening,<br />* Original Disneyland Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough attraction, unseen for years, presented in a virtual digital recreation which is BREATHTAKING. Almost like being at Disneyland. \\"Tour\\" it yourself, or with host Tony Baxter explaining your tour as you go through. There is also a featurette explaining the history of the walkthrough.<br />* Sequence 8 (Forest Scene) (5:30) is a featurette that shows the detail and labor that went into this sequence put together by Disney's famous \\"Nine Old Men.\\" This sequence alone cost the studio over $10,000. It is also interesting to note that only about 8 drawings were able to be done per day because of the precision required; considering it takes 24 to make a second of film, well...you do the math.<br />* Publicity features 3 trailers (teaser, original 1959, and 1995 re-release)<br />* \\"Four Artists Paint One Tree\\" (16:08) is a 1958 featurette that has four Disney artists (Marc Davis, Eyvind Earle, Joshua Meador, and Walt Peregoy) painting the same tree, each showing their own personal style.

B000005H7D|5.0|If you know Coltrane, you know this record.    If you don't know Coltrane, either this or his Atlantic record \\"Giant Steps\\" is, I think, an ideal place to begin.    \\"Giant Steps\\" is the more historically important of the two records - for its contribution to the jazz songbook almost as much as the fresh peak it represented in Coltrane's development. And the fact that each song has a memorable tune that you can whistle to yourself makes it very easy to become familiar with.    But there are extra-musical attractions to jazz as well - which need not be condescended to. This is a more archetypally \\"jazzy\\" record than \\"Giant Steps\\". [You may already know that it being a product of the Blue Note label has a lot to do with that.] You would more readily pick it as the soundtrack to a scene set in a swinging jazz club. It would look more immediately cool on your record shelf - if people had record shelves any more.    And I bet your feet will be tapping. Give it a try!
B000021Y7X|5.0|This was great when it was released in the 80's and continues to hold up today.  This \\"low tech\\" concert manages to entertain with the simplist of props.

B0017ASV1C|5.0|I think people are misinterpreting the film. This isn't M Night Shyamalan. The flashbacks and \\"twist\\" in the end weren't supposed to be a shocker or a revelation. It was to make a point. The killer's identity is insignificant.     The story is about two police officers who went into the job with the best of intentions. They are by nature good men. The job and the ineffectiveness of the system weighs on them both and damages them both differently.     The killer's actions throughout the movie can be justified by the audience. We get to know the characters and grow to like them. It doesn't matter who the killer is because we've grown to care for them and it has been determined that the actions of the killer are forgivable. He killed murderers, rapists and pedophiles - people who deserved to die. The transition in the film is when the killer hurts an innocent. When he victimizes someone who doesn't deserve it, the revelation should happen. It isn't a hammer like hollywood is known for. It's more subtle.     Can you forgive him now? You know him. You like him. He had good intentions and his motive is understandable. Can you forgive him for what he did? Do you even care about the other character enough for it to bother you?     If you do forgive his character and like him in the end, is it fair to root for the demise of all of the 'bad guys' before. We didn't know their story. We didn't know their motives or intentions. They're a blank slate.     It's much easier to root for the death and destruction of those we do not know that commit heinous acts than those we do. That is the point.     Either man could have been the killer. It didn't matter. The ending flashback sequences were an explanation and nothing more. It wasn't intended to be a \\"WOW\\" moment. It was deeper than that.     I was blown away by the movie. It was a thought-provoking movie that pushes you to believe one way (that getting the bad guys is just) to completley having to readjust your thought process (well....rape is bad, but......)   That to me is much better than a cheap shocker. It's an unjustified compromise that one makes with themselves. For a film to do that is quite amazing.

B00197U13Y|4.0|I have to say I wasn't very impressed with this album when I first listened and then for a few months after that. I thought it was the \\"boring rock n roll record\\" I thought you would never want to make. I thought it was a backwards step. But over time and repeated realizing how great the songs actually were and started getting off on how much energy and vitality there was in the performances. This has definitely been a grower for me. It is great that each record they make is so far removed from the previous one. I am forward to the new one for sure and considering they have a contract that allows them to release one a year. I do not have long to wait. I have to say the only reason this gets a four is because I still think Cavalettas drags itself too long. and plus for me I still think Frances The Mute is their crowning achievement. I think in 10 or so years people will realize that how remarkable it is. But hey maybe they will prove me wrong with the next few records they release.

1400034205|4.0|The Razor's Edge is one of Somerset Maugham's most beloved novels.  It's the story of Larry Darrow, an aviator so damaged by the carnage of World War I that he refuses to jump on the capitalist carousel in post-war Chicago.  Instead he devotes his life to searching out the true and the good.  His choice doesn't sit well with his fianc&eacute; Isabel Bradley, who loves him but loves the high life equally well.  Isabel breaks off their engagement to marry a stockbroker.  Larry continues on his spiritual search, which culminates after many years in the hills of India, where he hopes to get a glimpse of the Absolute.<br /><br />What makes The Razor's Edge a very good novel prevents it from being a great one.  That is Maugham's decision to use himself as the narrator of the story.  Gore Vidal once perceptively remarked that Maugham's greatest literary creation may have been the authorial persona he used to narrate his fiction.  This faux Maugham is lucid, clear-eyed, observant and tolerant.  He presents himself as the reader's guide and friend, shameless pandering that happens to work.  But because Maugham tells the story, we don't experience the agony or ecstasy of Larry's spiritual search.<br /><br />Larry works in coal mines, tramps through Europe, spends years poring through arcane texts, tries to save a self-destructive childhood friend, but whenever Maugham meets up with him, he's calm, rational, and well turned-out.  What Larry's after is the obliteration of the self, which is a crazy thing to want, and he's willing to surrender everything that's important to most people - love, money, career - to achieve it.  But whenever he's confronted on the self-destructiveness of his quest, he smiles, shrugs and deflects the question with charming good manners.  Compare him to, say, Dostoievki's seekers, who curse, laugh, cry, rage, bleed as they ram head on into their fates. Ultimately, Larry's a mystery to Maugham, and remains one to us.<br /><br />None of this wrecks the novel.  Maugham is far too accomplished a craftsman not to give pleasure.  His description of the transatlantic high life in France, England and America during the Roaring Twenties is captivating.  The supporting characters, especially Isabel's snobbish uncle Eliott, and Sophie MacDonald, the damaged gamine Larry tries to save, are engagingly complicated.  The climax of the book, an all night conversation where Larry tries to describe what he found in India is an inspiring piece of erudition and introspection on Maugham's part, written decades before the path to India became muddied by hordes of western seekers.<br /><br />Despite the book's many pleasures, the authorial choice to describe Larry from the outside objectifies his purely subjective quest, which is the search for a meaning that stands outside of time and the ego that seeks it.  Maugham's eye caresses the surface textures of the world, which allows him to connect with his readers, but not to guide them convincingly into Larry's ethereal domain.omplished a craftsman not to give pleasure.

B000PXUA5W|5.0|My 60 year-old mom bought a Lego watch a few months ago. I'd been eying them since I was about 8, and hers looked so cool, I decided to invest in one, too. The number of compliments I've received on this soccer watch, from other 19 year-old college students and adults alike, has been pretty incredible.    The fact of the matter is everyone loves Legos, and having a watch that can be disassembled, reassembled, resized, and customized any way you like makes it even better.    Get one. The only thing the watch does is tell time, but it's very durable and classy.    UPDATE: It didn't last as long as I'd hoped -- less than a year. Actually, it was only one piece that broke, but it was one of the halves of the clasp, and there weren't any replacement pieces in the box. Bummer!
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|I usually like all things that have to do with the Tutors or Anne Boleyn, but this movie didn't cut it.<br />Most of the characters were miscast for one.<br />The way the story was told stunk.<br />I read the book \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and enjoyed that, but this movie version was a waste.<br />Guess after seeing \\"Anne of the Thousand Days\\" so many times, I am spoiled. That is the best Henry 8/Anne Boleyn movie ever.<br />Only reason this movie gets 2 stars is the costumes and scenery were nice to look at.
1400063515|3.0|As most reviewers have already commented there's not much wrong with the book content-wise. The problem I had with the book was the writing style (too ponderous). Also the author is somewhat too full of himself.    It's too bad that the really good and refreshing points made in the book get almost swamped by these major obstacles. These make reading the book somewhat problematic.    I managed to get through it all, but I can understand that lots of people will stop halfway through.
B00004CX8F|1.0|I just watched this film for the umpteenth time on DVD and haven't tired of it one bit. Never one to be easily impressed by a film or won over by gore or special effects, my love of this particular film is rather deep.  To start with Neil Jordan is a marvellous director, who has brought us such classics as The Company of Wolves, The Crying Game and The Butcher Boy. This man is a genius of vision and brings out the most honest performances from his cast. I don't think that we will ever see a better performance from any of the actors. It was, unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst's zenith of credibility at such a young age, nothing that she has done since has come close to her brilliantly painful, evocative performance here as the tortured Claudia. Nor is it likely that Brad Pitt's morose Louis will be outdone with any of his other roles (nay, I think Louis even outdoes Pitt's portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys). And Tom Cruise has never been so powerful in a role. All three bring wonderfully nuanced subtlties to their roles as the vampire trio and it is enormously compelling and emotionally touching to watch them on their journey.  Every detail of this film, from Philippe Rousselot's award-winning cinematography to the wonderfully detailed art direction and Stan WInston's always reliable makeup and effects, are exceptionally created and add to the brooding mood of this film. Without Elliot Goldenthal's sombre, beautiful score which was shamelessly beaten at the oscar's by Hans Zimmer's score from THe Lion King, the film would been very different. The moving string and choral melodies and horns provide such a marvellous atmosphere.  The story itself is so heart-breaking and involving. If you let yourself into the world of the vampire (which is rather accessible through the afforementioned cinematic techniques) Interview with the Vampire proves to be a beguiling and unique experience. It is a soaring emotional journey, a quest to not only find the meaning of immortal life, but the very reason for existence.  I am greatly moved and satisfied by Interview with the Vampire each time I watch it. It is a great shame that the sequels (which were obviously originally planned to follow on closely from this film - or so the ending suggests) were not handled by the same crew. Queen of the Dammed (actually the third book in the Vampire CHronicles - they skipped The Vampire Lestat) is rather pitiful and lacks the depth and intelligence of Interview with the Vampire. Hopefully if others are to be made, Neil Jordan, or someone at his level, will take the helm. If not, at least we are left with this beautiful film, for there is no other vampire film quite like it.

B00005N6KG|5.0|As a runner, I need lightweight headphones that don't jump/move/jar around.  I hate ear buds (hate them!) as they are seemingly designed for people w/LARGE ear holes!  These things are tiny, fit nicely IN your ear and provide great sound without annoying you on a long run!  The price is fabulous too!  Last time I ordered, I bought 4 pairs (whenever I like something it seems to be discontinued) and I just broke into pair #2 this week (after almost a year w/the others).  I've run in these for 3 half marathons and countless training runs, inside and out.  If I wouldn't wad them up and throw them in my gym bag, they'd probably last even longer, but eventually one side tends to give out.

0596522347|4.0|Slide:ology is really an incredible book. I do some presentations part time for a music business. I really felt overwhelmed in starting it. It is not a primer. If you are experienced with PowerPoint you will get a lot out of it. If you are beginning, then use the PP tutorials on the web. This is advanced board-room stuff. Don't get me wrong. It is a great book with incredible visuals. I have gotten a lot out of it. The ideas are there. How to do what they say is up to you to spend time with the program. I would have given it 5 stars but for the need to really be an advanced user. I would have preferred a section for the novice advancing to the more detailed presentations. The pictures and graphics are great but I feel like I am watching someone who knows how and where to get these, but I don't. It is daunting!! Yet, it really is a must read if you are entangled in the corporate world of presentations. For me, an intermediate, I have to go back into the PP program and learn more about the how-to portions. Then maybe I can get my monies worth out of the book!

B000YAA68W|5.0|Iran is still to these days in the focus of world wide attention. After Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appearance in Clumbia University last year, it seems that nothing has been changed since the Islamic revolution that took place in 1978. Iran is a fundamentalist country oppressing freedom of speech not to mention the thousands who were brutally emprisoned and executed since the fled of the Shah. Persepolis - the name of the ancient capital of Persia during the Achaemenid Empire in 550-330 BC.<br />Alluding to ancient Persia is of no coincidence; it meant to bring to the open the tragedy of the people of Iran whose freedom is constantly denied by treaturous leaders. The comic book, or to be exact - the graphic novel written by Marjane Satrapi focuses on her expirience as a child grown up in between two eras - the Shah and Komeini, and the means the new regime took to indoctrinate its fundemental islamic ideology. The film is based on Satrapi's book, carefully adheres to its style by using straightforward simple images mostly in black and white telling the story of Satrapi's life in Iran as a child and in Vienna after she fled from her country. Being an animated film, it is not an entertaining film suitable for children. It is a poignant film which takes us through the harsh times Satrapi and her family went through the dark days of 1978 telling the story of the Iranian nation at large.<br /><br />Ben Baruch Blich, ph.d.<br />History and Theory dept.<br />Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design<br />Jerusalem

Now, I can see from looking at the reviews here that there are two camps here, one that is comparing this album to the other 3 Kings albums and 1 that is taking this album for what it is and comparing to what is out there now and realizing that they are maturing as a band. No this album isn't as wild, loud or crazy as the previous three. But just as No Code was the essential coming of age maturing record in Pearl Jam's career and one that was very highly debated upon its release, so is \\"Only By The Night\\" in Kings of Leon's career. This album is great, and its greatness is only multiplied when you judge this album not by previous KOL recordings but judge on what is coming out now a days. The music scene is pretty much terrible right now and Kings of Leon give us true music lovers a reason to visit the record store.
0575081406|5.0|I consider myself to be a fantasy fanatic! This had something different from all other fantasy books i have read. It goes into great depth on the growth process of one young man, Kvothe. As a character Kvothe is very relatable and interacts with others like a young man in his position would. Although this is written in first person perspective it doesnt lack the intrigue and suspense of what is going to happen. This may be written in a new world but the author doesnt focus on the surroundings but uses the characters to create a world. It is a great work of literature and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a great read!
0312427999|5.0|After reading this book, I was angered and horrified at the thought of what the future holds for all of us.  I'm now going to trash my copy of Friedman's \\"The World Is Flat\\".
0375826726|2.0|I'm not your typical Eragon basher.  I find the professional Eragon detractors tiringly obsessive, and every time someone clogs up a message board with another hey-this-is kinda-like-Star Wars post he's SURE is pure unprecedented genius insight, I'm certain an angel loses his wings.      Unfortunately, the series is growing into the complaints. Paolini does have talent, but his sales figures and incredible life story have seemingly allowed his manuscripts to go unchecked, and his writing flaws are getting worse, not better.       Three major problems with \\"Brisingr\\":    1) It's way too violent.  It opens on a group of fanatics who slice off their own limbs to prove their faith, whose rituals we observe in loving detail.  (The head priest has lopped himself down to just a torso.)  We soon continue to a torture victim whose eyes have been pecked  -  eaten  -  out of his face.  \\"Gore\\" is Paolini's favorite word, particularly when it is \\"smeared\\" on something, and we get endless graphic depictions of Roran's hammer smashing an enemy soldier's skull/throat/arm/spine, its owner rejoicing in the carnage.  I don't expect war to be bowlderized, but the book revels in charnel for its own sake and is too bloody for readers under thirteen.    2) Eragon has become a bit of a sociopath.  A reunion with one of his childhood bullies  -  who's just been through horrific torture  -  becomes a control-and-humiliate fantasy that's disturbing.  When the typically closed Arya touchingly recounts her love's recent death and how it stole all joy from her world, Eragon's heart is unmoved; he feels only irritation and jealousy, fuming that he will \\"not be discouraged in his suit\\".  (Has he been reading \\"The Game\\"?)  The book's ruminations on the morality of killing reach only the uninspired conclusion that it's unavoidable in war, and we're thus meant to take a certain satisfaction when Eragon joyfully dispatches even those ordinary men forced into service by Galbatorix.  I guess the debatewas meant only to free us from our nagging moral reservations.    As in \\"Eldest\\", Eragon's praised to high heaven by every single soul, given credit for every achievement.  At points, the book seems to have other characters only so that they can sing of their inferiority to its shining star.     3) As nearly every other commenter has noted, it's too bloated, with deadly pacing.  Galbatorix's nightmarish Ra'zac servants are dealt with early, leaving Eragon to dither with rebel leader Nasuada and go off on a few preparatory errands for about 600 pages.  (A 200-page detour into dwarf politics is particularly deadening.)  We keep waiting for the meat to arrive, for some crisis or confrontation, and (save for a quick and inconsequential early battle with Murtagh) it never comes.  There is no real climax, save for the easily-accomplished sacking of one city and a death we all long saw coming, albeit not in such meaningless circumstances.       The lack of individual voices in the story makes things drag all the more; every character has an identical manner of speaking, all bloviation and overexplanation in high-fantasy Olde Englishe.  Paolini too often substitutes scads of meaningless proper names for the little moments that make bring a fantasy world to life.     A few of those moments slip through, though, like the dotty old man who roosts in the majestic ruins of a half-toppled, tree-like tower, harvesting peas.  Or when Arya, on a whim, braids a miniature ship from wild grasses and breathes into it magic that will allow it fly for perpetuity; Eragon wonders what stories people will tell of it in the years to come.  I laugh at the self-important magicians' society Du Vrangr Gata, whose study of the ancient language is not as complete as they think and whose name therefore translates into the Alagaesian equivalent of Engrish.  I like the atypically crusty elven smith, intolerant of how \\"too polite, too refined, too precious\\" her Tolkien-influenced race has become, or the touches of culture (family totems, bedtime stories) Paolini has given his orc race.  For those who like dragons, Saphira's a sparkling specimen.    And there are *dwarf ninjas*.  That's gotta count for something, with someone.    My point is that the books need less Gary Stu carnage and more gems like these.  Show us why this world is worth fighting (and fighting and fighting) for.    And we need some actual change to come out of all these pages.  Roran's love soothes his anxiety over his battlefield casualities by opining that he'd be evil only if he actually enjoyed killing.  Later -  whaddaya know  -  Roran DOES come to love killing, quite enthusiastically, but the book forgets to look at him any differently.  Eragon makes a few crucial mistakes in dwarfland due to arrogance and petulance, but he is still lavishly praised from here to Valinor.  Nasuada endures a (naturally) bloody duel for leadership of the rebel faction, yet she is viewed no differently by her people afterward.  Murtagh's horrific tragedy, the king who hosts the rebel Varden yet resents being pushed to the sidelines in his own country, the new hot elf guardsman who's really a lion-type furry and whose musk gets all the females...er, in heat  -  nothing comes of any of it.  (The waste of Murtagh, who now apparently exists only to be ruthlessly dispatched, is particularly criminal.)  C'mon, Rowling introduced and destroyed seven whole Horcruxes in the same space!  Pick a story and develop it!    Also, are we gonna SEE Galbatorix before this series ends?  There is an evil EMPEROR in this evil empire, correct?    Enough sarcasm, though.  Again, it's senseless to waste your life hating these books as some do, all anti-Shur'tugal; better simply to move on to other stories.  Myself, I just wish someone would guide Paolini  -  edit him down, focus him  -  so the rest of us got more out of his talent.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|not up to other great cd's-musically flat and lacks the verve and individuality of earlier efforts-did not grab my attention as i thought it would-even after several plays
0800177363|4.0|I think \\"Awakenings\\" is a good dramatization of the real life scientific study as presented in the book. But I'm more interested in the scientific story than a dramatazation of it that creates a love interest and basically has Robin Williams playing the role he'd redo in Patch Adams (albeit of course much better in \\"Awakenings\\") than actually relive the life of the renowned neurologist Oliver Sacks who is of course fictionalized here and wrote the book. And the portrayal of people with disabilities takes the usual Hollywood stereotypes, they are shuffling zombies who lack humanity, their humanity is restored by a \\"miracle\\" (hate that word) drug L-Dopa and then lose it again but there is a hint they were human all along. Well to tell you the truth I know this may blow your mind but having a disability is something we all will experience or may already and all people should be considered human. However, it is true this was a clinical study and its accurate that that is how people are seen in a study or certainly by medical science at the time but as a survivor of tardive dyskinesia and tardive psychosis (a condition still in study), both Parkinsonian conditions although in this case enduced by neuraleptics who has had it treated by new medications in study (as well as study anti-psychotics that can't create these conditions) and began to recover, in experiencing this kind of recovery first hand (the movement disorders depicted in \\"Awakenings\\" are startingly similar to those I have and are well depicted)I found the original book and enlightening and did find the film moving I must admit but it got a bit maudlin and took liberties with the book. However, more importantly, it seemed out of the scope of this movie and much Hollywood fare that a person with this form of disability could not only be a part of society but could advocate for treatment and to recover. And I would hope that that could be changed. But as in the movie \\"hope\\" didn't get people anywhere. Scientific research in a humanistic fashion of which I am an active participant in and advocate did and when I look at \\"Awakenings\\" in this light yes there is something moving about but more in the spirit of the original research, not at at all as a \\"failed\\" experiment but one to build on so more people can recover as I did. And there is no time for \\"miracles\\" as with the original research it only gets in the way of what is ahead.research in a humanistic fashion of which I am an active participant in and advocate did and when I look at \\"Awakenings\\" in this light yes there is something moving about but more in the spirit of the original research, not at at all as a \\"failed\\" experiment but one to build on so more people can recover as I did.

B000SSDQYG|5.0|I am a bit of a nostalgic vinyl record buff, so my preference for this format for certain recordings will be apparent. I prefer to get older records on vinyl, as I recently wanted to get CSN&Y's Four Way Street, and found the original LPs in excellent shape via Amazon. I just love holding the big double album open, carefully pulling out the records out of their sleeves, and placing the turntable needle gently on the first groove. Ahh...I am back in 1971! Although I have a considerable collection of music on CD and digitally stored as MP3s, there is a certain warmth to analog vinyl that simply is absent from the digitized formats. And LPs can be converted to CD easily, when desired, these days.<br />But back to why I needed to have this album: when it first came out in 1971, several of my friends had it, and literally played it to death! Though I still have the first CSN album and Deja Vu with CSN&Y, I never bought this record because I simply had heard it enough - until now. I recently saw Crosby, Stills & Nash live and their performance was still so good, I had to go back through their catalog to have another listen. That's when I realized that I never owned this album, so hearing it again after 37 years was a refreshing revelation. The warm and intimate feel in David Crosby's acoustic songs such as The Lee Shore and Triad, make the listener feel as if you are in the room with the band - or at least in the audience at the Fillmore East, where it was recorded. Neil Young's songs sound fresh, and the bite of his anthemic Ohio is a predictor of his recent politically-charged tunes. Young and Stephen Stills provide much of the rocking backbone on this live set, with extended \\"jam\\" versions of Southern Man and Carry On. Graham Nash was always my least favorite, but Teach Your Children is a classic and Chicago is another politically-inspired song, this one about the 1968 Democratic Convention. And let's face it - he is very much a major contributor to the amazing harmonies on all of the tunes.<br />This recording is a classic in any format - I just happen to prefer the old music in its original format. But anyone who likes classic rock'n'roll and folk-rock (now THERE is an old label!) owes themselves the pleasure of owning this album, in analog or digital format.on all of the tunes.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|This will be short and sweet...I LOVE IT! I am a HUGE fan of the entire series and was so happy with the movie. If you are a fan, it's a MUST have. If you are a new viewer, check this out so you can understand the Sex and the City obsession of women everywhere!
0375826726|4.0|Really, did you expect this book to be ingenious? It's just a book that is clearly stated to \\"Wrap up all the promises Eragon is stuck upholding\\" Personally, Paolini could have added more flare, and this no Eragon, as was Eldest, but, I mean, still. If you love a series enough to buy it's third book on amazon.com, then you're not expecting a great literary work. You're expecting a continuation, answers to your questions, and a straightforward continuation to what you have read thus far. What I'm saying is, fans of the books will be satisfied with what this book adds to the whole stew of Eragon knowledge. And, on the bright side, might I add that Paolini basically unwrapped Eragon from most of his bonds, so the fourth book should be a little more free and exciting. And as an afterthought, it's not even that bad.
B000B8QG0O|4.0|Previously my children owned the Toy Story 2 VHS a while back.  Over the years, somehow the VHS copy was lost.  Since then, my kids have had to borrow copies from their friends as well on rent it from the local video store.  When I saw this deal for the special edition 2 disc set on Amazon.com, I quickly jumped on it.  Of course, the DVD quality is much better than the VHS.  But an extra added bonus was the second DVD which included funny outtakes and a pretty decent game that the whole family enjoys playing.  If you've been stalling to purchase this movie, now is the time to \\"lasso\\" it in.  And while you're at it, why not pick up Toy Story 1 to complete the package.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|How does one steal a movie that sees both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench hit high notes as supporting characters?  Keira Knightley does it by (a) playing one of the best roles in Western literature in Elizabeth Bennett and (b) nailing it.    This adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit more scruffy (and therefore realistic) than its natural complement, Emma Thompson's adaptation of Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  Everyone looks gorgeous, or course, but they also don't look like they had Hollywood hair stylists, either.  This helps the movie, as it underscores Austen's theme - England was a dangerous place for young ladies unable to get married.    Indeed, just as with \\"S&S,\\" marriage is the peril and promise for all the characters in the story.  Does a woman grab what she can and hope to make the best of it?  Or does she hold out for true love?  And what do two lovely parents (Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn) do when they are relatively poor and (gasp!) unconventional but have five daughters they need to send into wedlock?    One is to be delighted when a rich young man rents the nearby manor and brings along his dark friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen of \\"MI-5\\" fame).  Lizzie and Darcy fall for each other immediately, but are compelled by circumstance as well as Lizzie's pride and prejudice (you knew they'd turn up somewhere) to go through one of the greatest love stories of all time.    This is a gorgeous, funny movie with several thrilling ball and dance scenes, and the camera quietly does yeoman's work as it wanders through chambers and down hallways to keep the large cast in play and the viewer well-grounded in the story.  Of course the camera also knew to linger often on Ms. Knightley's beauty just often enough!  But she is no mere adornment - this is an excellent acting performance worthy of watching on its own merits.  Watching Lizzie how head-to-head with the rich society dame who hates her (Dench) is worth the price of admission.    I have not read \\"P&P,\\" so I cannot respond in detail to those who complain that the filmmakers have rewritten the story somewhat.  All I would say is that there are plenty of other \\"purist\\" adaptations of this story as well as the book itself, and that judged on its own merits, this is one heck of a film.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Definitely a return to form. Megadeth in my opinion has been fairly consistant with what Dave Mustaine writes. The recent Album offers the listener what Megadeth should sound like 25+ plus years since Dave has been in the business. Smart, and witty lyrics, heavy guitar riffs and ripping guitar solos reminicent of 80's style. Each song has it various qualities, all excellent. Highly recommended.
0553804367|5.0|I have not read the earlier version of this book yet, but this one was great.  I was able to read it in two sittings.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|We all know the movie, which is one of the most interesting ever made.  This collection of disk will give you everything you wanted ever know and see about the making of Blade Runner.  There is also a disc with some delete scenes, alternate endings and several documentary on the production of the movie which will reveal many anedocts that are very interesting. The documentary will reveal that the movie production was extremely under budget for how it was intended to be shot by Riddley Scott and he had to make so many compromises to get it to the end. Too bad they did not have a budget on the line of many of today's Hollywood productions.  The \\"final cut\\" blue ray disk, has an incredible quality. The film has been restored and I think colors and sharpness of the images has been enhanced using the latest digital technologies because the clarity and saturation of the colors is much better than any other version seen on disk or in theater. There also is one of the final scenes that has been completely re-shot using the latest computer graphics technology and finally makes the film to be as it was intended by the author.

I just upgrade it to Blu Ray, is just FANTASTIC, listen the concert in DTS.... be aware the package contains also a PAL DVD, which will only play in a PAL player.... The Blu ray disk is zone 0, and plays well in any blu ray player.
B0000024W3|4.0|I'm not going to change anyone's mind here, especially if you're an obsessive. But I'll say that I took the plunge with this album a few weeks ago and it's one of the most rewarding albums I've heard in a while. I'll acknowledge that it may have been seen as sort of a \\"set-up\\" after the highs of John Wesley Harding and the mainstream sophistication of Nashville Skyline, but if you listen without expecting Divine Prophecy you get a sweet, casual, almost playful album in return. It's his \\"Ram\\", to use a McCartney comparison, an easygoing and diverse set that one would expect if he and his band were playing at some rural beer joint on a Saturday night. Weird and irreverent covers, forlorn Americana visions, and burned-out rural dustiness abounds. \\"Little Sadie\\" is twisted into a truckstop Tom T. Hall sendoff, \\"Let It Be Me\\" sparks with an on-the-spot, improvised feel, \\"Hurts Me Too\\" makes a rich counterpoint to Pigpen's Dead version (which was a live Dead staple at the same time). \\"Rolling Stone\\" is exactly as I would expect it to sound by that time: a wan, wasted snapshot of a man and band pretty much over the profundity of it all, getting back to the basics of playing for the sake of it. The key I think to appreciating this album is not to make endless comparisons to his past catalog. \\"Wigwam\\" isn't \\"Tombstone Blues\\", and doesn't aspire to be. But the pleasantries here are many as a result of that newfound freedom. To me, the \\"New Morning\\" really started here.
1596434252|5.0|This book is a work of art, not just an art book. It is beautifully bound with new technology graphics so that the front cover changes depending on the position of view, and that is just the start. This alphabet book is unlike any other.<br /><br />It is a combination of pop-up letters that are some of the best engineering designs on the market, as well as interactive, moveable parts that create letters or change from one letter another. Yes, some care will be needed to teach a young child to be gentle and not destroy the fine workmanship, but this is a life lesson as well, and at the same time it is not so delicate as to fall apart in one reading. Respect for the book and its creation can provide parents the opportunity to spend quality time with children while learning the alphabet, details, empowerment, respect, care, and much more.<br /><br />This book would also make a great gift to art students from elementary to adult. They can explore how each page was created and use the text as a model for creating their own multidimentional work. It is an absolutely amazing item!
B000BYA5G4|4.0|\\"Lord of War\\" is a crafty, deceptively powerful film that comes off as a black comedy, but when measured in full effect, also serves as a potent statement on world arms, cynicism, and the very human of mental conditions - rationalization.<br /><br />The movie follows the career of Yuri Orlov, played by Cage, who steadily but artfully crafts a career as an arms merchant, eventually becoming one of the world's most successful at his trade. Along the way, he accumulates a trophy wife (beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan), his brother (played by Jared Leto) becomes a drug addict, he becomes rich beyond his wildest dreams, and he acquires a mortal enemy in a persistent Interpol agent, played by Ethan Hawke.<br /><br />It is not an understatement to say that Yuri goes through cataclysmic changes, and loses his soul and humanity along the way. As amoral a creature as we have seen in recent films, he can make excuses and has an answer for everything he does. Cage plays him first as an ambitious hustler who gets in over his head, then as a savvy professional, and finally, as an amoral, venal, megalomaniac who only cares about himself and his business. Everything else is to be managed, lied to, and avoided.<br /><br />Andrew Niccol has become quite savvy at writing and/or directing films that make very adept and pointed social commentary with films like Gattaca, The Truman Show, The Terminal, and Simone. But he may have topped himself with this film, which take a hard look at the buying and selling of arms like any other commodity. \\"The Lord of War\\" is a fine, provocative film that takes a hard look at how cheap life can become when money and power are in play.

1932100660|1.0|In the beginning of the book it appears that Campbell is going to give specific scientific findings of a study done in China that would confirm the connection of animal protein diet with cancer.  He starts with studies of rodents that showed 100% statistical connection.  It was expected that the same type of information would ensue, but it didn't.<br /><br />As the above review by Joseph DeMarinis \\"Truth in science\\" so decidedly outlines, Campbell goes mostly into broad statements taken from the dogma of vegetarianism.<br /><br />I got this book after taking the caregivers course at the Gerson Institute in San Diego where Dr. Max Gerson proved that a 100% vegetarian diet with juicing and techniques to pull out toxins cures cancer--  even advanced cancer after conventional medical techniques have failed. The Gerson diet stops tumor growth and completely invigorates the immune system to curing many other twentieth century diseases. It follows that a diet mostly of vegetables and fruits would be beneficial for preventing disease.<br /><br />This book did not come close to my expectations and is not recommended.<br /><br />One final point for the readers of this concerns the insistance that a 100% vegan diet cures heart disease.  In the book by Internationally acclaimed Cardiologist, Dr. Sodi Pallares, \\"My Hearts Health\\", Dr. Pallares states that after he observed thousands of patients on his vegetable and fruit diet that he found they did better with some good fats (2 tbls per day) and some protein.

B0000069NC|5.0|This is the only recorded live example of the short-lived trio Bill Evans had with Jack DeJohnette and judging from Bill's playing on this, it's a pity.  Outside of drummer/friend Philly Jo Jones, Evans has rarely played with as much fire as he does here, not to discredit his regular bassist at the time, the excellent Eddie Gomez, but it's no surprise that this record won a Grammy for Best Jazz Performance.  All the tracks shine but in particularly, Evans & company deliver such an impassioned performance of the Miles Davis modal tune, \\"Nardis\\", that one left me breathless.  I could never understand why the succeeding drummer, the overly busy Marty Morell, stayed on so long with Bill.  He lacked the precision and drive of DeJohnette, Philly Jo and Paul Motian and as such was a liability rather than an asset to the trio. Recommended for Evans fans definitely.

B00000I8UK|5.0|Eric Dolphy was one of those rare musicians for he could straddle between the avant-garde jazz world and that of classical music--not even Wynton Marsalis can claim that virtue since he has outrightly put down the avant garde in print.  If you're undecided about this form of jazz then do check out this album.  This was one of Dolphy's last recorded U.S. effort and it's a stunner (you wonder how backward Downbeat was when they gave this a less than stellar rating).  Backed by familiar co-horts such as Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson and Richard Davis, the virtuoso Dolphy demonstrates his excellence with his own tunes like the Monk-dedicated, \\"Hat & Beard\\" to a tribute to a fellow flautist, \\"Gazzeloni\\". And let's not forget the great late Tony Williams on drums--the success of this album is due to the empathy between him and Dolphy.  The only regret I have about the RVG version of this classic is that in the 20 bit remastering, separation is virtually lost and the sound is very thin, tinny.  If you can, do get the original issue or at worse, the European edition.  I traded the RVG version for an original issue which at that time was cheaper!!  Other RVG releases to avoid are \\"Midnight Blue\\" ,\\"Unity\\", and \\"Speak No Evil\\"--get the original issues.  Outside of that this album is recommended.

0345495004|1.0|I have been listening to this book on CD and couldn't finish the second of twelve CD's. Mamah's character is one-dimensional and for a woman who is evidently trying to find acknowledgement for her creative sensibilities, is astonishingly mute in her marriage. For example,her husband Edwin initiated giving her owl jewelry and figurines as presents, which she accepts without a word but with internal annoyance. Regardless of what era she's living in, what happened to \\"Honey,thanks for the owls, but it's not really to my taste-why don't I tell you more about what I would like\\". The author gives her no voice within her marriage to become closer to Edwin by taking any risk to let him know her. What was so terribly wrong with him? We never get to know. The few examples that are given are bizarre. The few hairs on the top of his head resembled banjo strings. Really? Other metaphors are trite. She and Frank were \\"spit out by fate\\" to be together because they were born around the same time.        The author may have been limited by the document-based nature of her fictionalization, which perhaps provides her with little knowledge about Mamah's childhood or personality development, but we are left with a rather passive person who seems to get obsessively attracted to a married man's charisma and creativity. She unhappily has to wait for him to become available,but doesn't seem to try to develop her own creativity. Hardly the story of a woman becoming liberated. It instead presents a woman who is selfishly able to leave children and family behind for a man who is a genius but also has a narcissistic personality disorder. That actually could have been interesting had that been written about with more skill.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I normally DO NOT say that a movie is better than the book, but sadly, in this case it's true. Yes, you get more background on the characters, but for me, the book was boring. The movie was more fast paced and didn't include anything dull.

It has all the other standard trappings of a quality modern day kid-flick: humorous characters, engaging plot, important life lesson learned by film's end. And as a bonus, Jack Black sings a modern version of \\"Kung-Fu Fighting\\" w/ Cee-Lo. Ska-doosh!
B0010YSD7M|3.0|I enjoyed Continuum much more. Maybe because it gives closure to the series. But, if you have enjoyed Stargate SG-1 all these years, you will enjoy this DVD then.
B00004T9VY|5.0|I was so excited when my CD arrived. I used to listen to this album with my mother,(she is no longer with us now) boy how it brought back special memories. I smile every time I listen to it.  Thank you,

1423113497|5.0|My 4th grade son who does not love to read absolutely loves this series.  I can't get him to stop reading; he is reading instead of TV, video games, outside, etc.  I read a few chapters of each of the 4 and they are well written, funny, and full of action/adventure.  Great books!

0061150142|5.0|This is the first book that I've read by Jodi and I love It. It got me so wrapped in the story that I couldn't put it down. I have read several others by the same author and I must say they never fail to amaze me, this is a must read for anyone!!
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This album is better than St. Anger, but that is saying very little. Many have complained about the horrible mixing, which is very true. Unfortunately the songs themselves are just plain bad, and no amount of remixing is going to change that. I had high hopes for this album....Their \\"uber producer\\" obviously is a bonehead and they need to dump him and just try writing some good music for once.
1582701709|1.0|Recently I've come to know about a book called \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne. A friend of mine gave me the book and asked my opinion about it. This book topped the charts and soon became the bestseller. A Hollywood movie is also being made based on this book.    This is one of the most absurd books I have ever read in my life. Leave the content aside, it isn't even original. A mediocre mind always craves that its desires come true. And cunning people encash their mediocrity. First of all, this is one of the biggest fallacies that thinking can get you anything. Sit and keep thinking about an ice-cream all the day, but you won't get one. No law whatsoever, including this foolish law of attracting can get you even an ice-cream. But to deceive others, cunning people device imaginary laws like this and fools fall in trap. The author says that thoughts, as explained in the book, can solve all the problems one has. But the reality is - thoughts cannot solve any problem. Thoughts themselves are the cause of problem or to put it more clearly, thoughts are the only problem. No matter you think positive thoughts or negative thoughts; you dissipate your energy that can be used in doing something creative. Once cannot be creative if one imagines something before doing as imagination is outcome of thoughts, of past and hence it cannot be new i.e. creative.    The best things in the world are unknown. The real secrets are unknown. You've never came in contact with those secrets ever before. So you cannot think of them because only that thing can be imagined which you already know. Therefore, to discover the immensity and the beauty of life, you must surpass the realm of thoughts, you must go beyond it. Be intelligent, leave mediocrity and take a leap into unknown...    [...]
B00005JN2Z|4.0|This film is not particularly rich as for the content. A professional killer has been hired to eliminate all the witnesses and even the cops and other prosecution personnel in some criminal case. Banal. He does not want to drive his own car and he does not want to hire a car and an accomplice to drive him around. So he comes at night and just hires a taxi and its driver. That makes him difficult to trace. But that creates some problems because the taxi-driver is not really willing to do the job. And then the two are like mutual prisoners or custodians. One cannot work without the other and one cannot escape from the other. Yet the taxi-driver, after a long series of killings, finds the courage to cause an accident which means the arrival of the cops, but that also means the discovery of the first body that had been put in the trunk and the taxi driver's discovery that the next and last target is the woman he had transported just before this embarrassing and invading client. He decides to escape from the cop who is trying to arrest him, and who was alone on his car patrol, and to prevent the killing of the girl. He will even go slightly further. But that's not the main interest of the film. We could have predicted all that from the very start. Then it's only details. The interest is the rhythm and the twists in the fabric of the tale. In fact it is economical in blood and even bullets because it centers on the psychological profile of the taxi-driver and the relation he establishes with his customer. Strangely enough it is more psychological than we could have expected and that saves the film from banality.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

As I read this intriguing book I started to notice why I was successful in some areas of my life and not in others. What I've been thinking is truly the reality I've created for myself.<br /><br />For years I've been able to manifest free books and my thoughts about receiving free books was constant until I had over 200 books to review and realized I didn't need as many. The minute I changed my thinking I had less offers and less books appeared. The only thing is, I had to write the first review.<br /><br />As Bob Doyle says in this book: \\"Action will sometimes be required.\\" This book almost seems to have a missing chapter, the one where the author explains the hard work most people have to do to see their dreams realized. Very few people will probably see their dreams materialize unless they take some initial action. You should not only imagine your future but also take steps in the direction of your dreams.<br /><br />Can you really think your way thin? This book claims you can. I tried putting up pictures on my mirror to inspire weight loss and I did lose 25 lbs but this was mostly because I also \\"literally took steps\\" by walking one hour a day. If I had only sat around imagining that I was thinner I doubt it would have worked. It also took me over 30 years to produce a cookbook, it didn't magically appear although I thought about it every day. I still had to do the hard work of testing the recipes and writing the instructions. Some of the authors in this book claim to have great riches and neglect to tell you that they also had to do the hard work of writing their books.<br /><br />I think this book works differently for each person. I have been able to manifest books, an amazing best friend (OK, I also prayed about this one), items that magically appear in the mail (answers to questions I had). So in some way \\"The Secret\\" is working in my life on a small scale. I still haven't been able to manifest my ideal house or a car.<br /><br />At times this book is overly materialistic. Do you really need a new car and all the car payments that come with it? Will a car magically appear just because you wish for one? This book claims that the Universe is a \\"genie\\" and it will give you everything you want. (In my own experience, praying to God is more effective than asking the universe for what I want.)<br /><br />I won't spoil the book for you by telling you the three main things you have to do to see your dreams appear in reality. They are relatively easy and it only takes a small amount of effort - mostly training your mind to think positively.<br /><br />While for the most part, this book shies away from religion it does go a little far by saying we are all God in human form (A very New Age belief). According to the Bible we are created in God's image.  There also is nothing about 9/11 or Katrina in this book. In fact this book claims that negative thoughts are not as powerful as positive thoughts.<br /><br />So if you want to try out extreme positive thinking and you are willing to \\"be your own experiment\\" I can recommend this book to you. I've seen some of the principles work in my own life so many of the ideas are true and testable.<br /><br />You may also want to read: [[ASIN:1565115694 Keys to Positive Thinking]] by Michael J.

067003830X|5.0|This book contains all kinds of fascinating theoretical information about the human brain, and how it works and can change itself. But its greatest value for me lies in all the practical ideas it offers on how to learn and teach better. It also extends hope and motivation to anybody who is trying to recover from a loss of body function due to brain damage caused by illness or injury. We have so much more potential for self-healing than we realize, if only we go about it in the right way, and persist, against all odds.
B000YABYLA|4.0|First off, I'm going to agree with the other reviewers who said that some of the opening scenes are pretty awkwardly written. That being said, \\"Juno\\" is a very well-done movie definetly worth watching. Ellen Paige breathes so much life into her unique character, a confident wierdo who's also very intelligent and complex, and there is no doubt you'll fall in love with her soon after meeting her. In fact, most of the characters are very well crafted, with the exception of maybe two, who are added for comedic effect but still sort of take away from the film. Definetly check this out, you'll enjoy it and maybe even love it.
0375826726|4.0|I've followed Eragon and his companions through three books now.  At the end of_Eldest_, I was rather disappointed.  I thought the whole idea of Eragon being related to one of the bad guys old and tired, some of the dialogue wooden and our hero's pining away for Arya distracting.  That said, I absolutely loved Oromis and thought him a suitable replacement for the sadly departed Brom.  And, being a history geek, I devoured all the historical stuff.  So, all in all I thought it was average but not as good as the first book, which had an urgency to it.  As a reader I felt like I didn't have time to breathe.  _Eldest_was a let down by comparison.  Now, it's a few years later and I've mellowed somewhat, and I picked up_Brisinger_with an open mind.  And you know what, I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  I understand what Paolini is trying to do and give him mad props for his ability to create a language with rules.  I also understand that, with all the detours into dwarf politics, moral quandries, ect., that Paolini is writing about things that interest him.  Do moral and ethical quandries have a place in fantasy? Absolutely. Sure, it may seen heavy handed, uneven and long-winded, but really, Eragon is not Conan the Barbarian. He's not Aragorn and he certainly IS NOT Ender Wiggin.  He shares much in common with the likes of R.A. Salvatore's Drizzt.  And yes, he whines a bit much.  But I'm willing to overlook such things because, when you get right down to it, Paolini has crafted a pretty compelling story.  Brisinger is better than its predecessor.  Any way you cut it, this book advances the story and, though you have to wait until the last part, has some pretty good revelations and interesting developements.  And yes, a character dies at the end.  I personally think another character should have died as well (a certain pointy eared elf princess), but it's not my story.  It's Chrisopher Paolini's.  And I, for one, am quite interested in seeing how it ends.
B000000WA4|3.0|There are some UNDOUBTEDLY classic songs on this album, and Billy Corgan's songwriting is top notch! However, I'd say I enjoyed only about half of the songs on the disc. Billy Corgan's voice can be annoying sometimes, and their \\"harder\\" songs are poorly executed and just kinda emo-ish and lame. This album should be listened to in sort of a story structure, but for a new Smashing Pumpkin fan like myself, stick to Siamese Dream for now.

B00003CWL6|4.0|My mom had this dvd lying around the living room so I decided to watch it today since I was bored with nothing else to do.  I knew a little bit about it from watching the oscars back in 1999 and from word-of-mouth.  It is a pretty good movie story wise, though a little predictable at times.  All the characters can be relatable.  Kevin Spacey delivers a dramatic and comendable performance and Anette Bening is great too.  The acting in this movie was top notch.  I would have give it 5 stars it if werent for the predictibility in this movie.  Overall, I would reccomend it to casual movie fans like myself.

1401201911|2.0|Normally, when I get my hands on one of these babies and I just cannot put it down.  Not the case with this one.  An Elseworlds story on what if Superman landed in the USSR instead?  Certainly, this would make an intriguing story.  Some of the differences include a new costume, Batman as a vigilante in USSR, Jimmy as a government spy, and Lois as wife of Lex Luthor.  Some of these differences are self-explanatory, but others such as Batman being in USSR and Jimmy working for CIA is not really explained.  Add to also, really boring writing (took me several sittings to finish it) and not too interesting storylines and you get three snoozefest stories.<br /><br />The first story on Luthor creating Bizarro to battle Superman is very uninteresting.  Luthor is hired by US Govt to counteract the Superman threat and is considered a hero in this book.<br /><br />The second story is somewhat more interesting as Batman teams up with Luthor in bringing down the man of steel.  I really enjoy how they do this and Batman's costume is pretty nice, but again, there is no explanation to why he is here in this country.<br /><br />Third story is suppose to be epic as the last and final assault launched by the US to destroy Superman.  Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Lex, attack at the same time.  However, the final climatic moment is very weak and quite confusing.  And the epilogue is not really as brilliant as one would think, probably tiresome as this book is too long and boring.<br /><br />The only saving grace is the artwork which resembles propaganda-ish cartoon art which is very popular in communist countries.  The Wonder Woman in this book is one of the best and most accurate I ever seen.

B000KN7BIQ|5.0|I will refrain from commenting on technological aspects of presentation to concentrate on the storyline, which is worth watching any way you can get it.<br /><br />It is ironic that I have not reviewed this previously, and that I had actually just watched \\"The Sting\\" - for about the 60th time - on the day that I read of the passing of Paul Newman. This is a movie for the ages, filmed to look like the old movies of the 40s, and I have enjoyed it now since its first showing in 1973.<br /><br />Backed by an incomparable score - one of the best ever done for film - it tells the story of two con men, Johnny Hooker(Robert Redford) and Henry Gondorff(Paul Newman), and their plot to undermine a vicious third con man, Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hooker is on the lam from the cops in Joliet, Illinois, for his low-level cons, and also from Lonnegan, because of inadvertently relieving the crime boss of a considerable chunk of change during one of those cons. Lonnegan, who does not forgive being bested by anyone, much less a grifter, has hit men out looking for Hooker. Hooker hightails it for Chicago, to sanctuary with an old friend of his mentor's.<br /><br />Hooker finds that contact, a legendary con man named Henry Gondorff, in somewhat reduced circumstances, recovering from a retreat necessitated by crossing the wrong political figure. Hooker arrives on Henry's doorstep eager for tutelage in a way to get back at Lonnegan, who has succeeded in murdering Hooker's mentor in Joliet. The mentor, Luther, was universally loved within the con world; Lonnegan is universally hated and feared, with good reason. So Gondorff pulls himself out of his funk to assist Hooker in conning the con as spectacularly as possible.<br /><br />The pacing and acting in this film is impeccable and a joy to watch. All the principals were perfect in their different roles. Henry Gondorff assembles a host of players with special talents to help take down Lonnegan; and it shows how much theater is involved in the complete execution of the perfect con. The men who make up Henry's cadre of inner circle all have some specialty in the underworld; Twist (Harold Gould) is a personnel director par excellance; J.J. (Ray Walston)is a specialist in the mechanics involved in the plan, in this case running the Wire, reading horse racing results; there is a banker, Eddie (John Heffernan)who takes care of the finances. Together they weave a plot to pay back Lonnegan for his murdering Luther.<br /><br />The feel of the 30s, at the height of the Depression, is clear throughout \\"The Sting\\". Men lounge in doorways, defeated; hobo jungles and shack towns cluster near the tracks; everyone is just a little seedier-looking than they should be, and the lure of money is everywhere. Life burns bright in everyone, in a fever glow of enjoy-it-while-you-can. The temper of what the 30s must have been like is felt in this film, with all its desperation and little victories. In the original con, when Hooker and Luther grift a collection man for Lonnegan of $11,000, Hooker says in breathless wonder, \\"We're millionaires!\\"<br /><br />This movie has probably seen more airplay at my house than any other movie I own. I saw it several times at the theater when it originally came out; took several friends to see it, because of the great twist at the end (no spoilers) and have had it in various formats since it became available for personal viewing. All technologies aside, this is a film that deserves top shelf in anyone's collection; great acting from everyone, great sets, wonderful score (you'll try to hum along with it but it's difficult), and perfect timing throughout. It's interesting to see how the different actors have aged since then also. Redford was a fresh-faced, wide-eyed blond in those days, and seemed younger than he was. Newman, who always played down his good looks, exudes a world-weariness with a sardonic grin, and could have pulled off cons on his own if that's the line of work he had chosen. I would certainly have believed him.<br /><br />\\"The Sting\\" is highly, highly recommended. One of the best films ever made.The Sting\\" is highly, highly recommended. One of the best films ever made.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I just finished watching the seven episodes back-to-back.      The story of John Adams and his contemporaries is something young people in the U.S. need to understand.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend this for children and young people because of the graphic nature of the tar/feather scene, the amputation scene, and the surgery scene.  I understand that graphic scenes are something adults are supposed to tolerate (although I don't tolerate them well), but it's wrong to expect children to handle those scenes, even if they see graphic violence in movies and games.      Was it necessary to show the saw hacking through the limb?  And was it necessary to show the breast surgery in graphic detail?  For that matter, was it necessary to show John and Abigail celebrating their reunion with a quick nooner?  It felt gratuitous, like because it's an HBO movie they had to be sure to include enough blood and toss in some spontaneous sex, but unfortunately these scenes make the movie unacceptable for the audience that would most benefit from understanding John and Abigail.    Well done series for adults, great acting (although Thomas Jefferson was wooden), powerful score, but I learned more from the book, and enjoyed the ride every word of the way.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I remember seeing a traditional La Fille a long time ago; I was bored stiff. But on the strength of the many 5 star reviews, I took a risk on this La Fille.<br /><br />Do it! Like the Le Elisir d'amore with Netrebko and Villazon [[ASIN:B000F3T3CS Donizetti - L'Elisir d'Amore / Eschwe, Netrebko, Villazon, Wiener Staatsoper]], it takes middling music and makes it tremendous fun. Don't let the anachronistic setting (WW I?) scare you off; this is one of those cases where it works.<br /><br />Dessay starts out as a near-manic, but her acting quickly turns the prosaic story into a dramatic hoot.<br /><br />And then there's Florez' high C's: enough said.<br /><br />I haven't seen the competing La Fille with Ciofi and Florez, but this one is simply too much fun. Get it.
0143038583|3.0|My title says it all. I ripped through the first two-thirds or so thinking this was one of the greatest non-fiction books I've read. I learned a ton about the business of food production I never knew, told in a excellent narrative style that made the book a page-turner. But then he went pig hunting and started to bore the bejesus out of me, and the mushroom hunt was even worse. I finally put the book down during the mushroom chapter, never to pick it up again. Five stars before the pig hunt, one star afterwords.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I don't think there is enough space in this review window to do this movie justice! This is the movie that helped launch the careers of such celebrated comedians like Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn! And man do they earn their honors with this movie! I think one of the things that makes this movie so widely loved is that it identifies with college students as well as people in their later 20s and 30s.<br /><br />There are so much LOL moments in this that you'll barely have time to catch a breath. This is a worthy DVD buy because this movie has LOTS of rewatchability (is that even a real word????). You and your friends will get lots of mileage out of this one. And the nudity doesn't hurt either!<br /><br />To see more of my movie reviews, Google: Yank Lime Pie

0441013074|4.0|Despite the fact that Amazon put \\"Revelation Space\\" beside the title of this book, it is not set in that universe. It does have some similarities like a type of nanocaust, a faction of humanity that embraces technology in their bodies, and something like the Glitter Band.    But the story itself is unique. The mixing of 1950s Paris with hard scifi ended up being much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It's pacing was great for 3/4 of the book. I would almost call it a \\"nail biter.\\"    But I felt that the dialogue was a little forced and unnatural at times and the inclusion of every little street name the characters passed was tedious and distracting (in the same way Reynolds over-defined the landscape of Hela in \\"Absolution Gap\\"). And I hope by now that Reynolds realizes there is no US state called simply \\"Dakota\\". But all in all its worth a read.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Except, they do still sing--as sort of narration for their emotions. The songs are highly unmemorable (as I sit here writing this, I can only remember the line, \\"I'll make a man out of you,\\" which is from the very worst song ever including in a Disney film.  By the way, will Disney ever have a \\"training session\\" that will last more than a couple minutes and that isn't put to a song? They did that to this movie, Hercules, Tarzan (who also grew into an adult instantaneously), and Beauty and the Beast (in that Belle changes her mind about the Beast during a song).  One more really bad thing about Mulan--Mushu is a total hinderance. I'm not just talking about his pop-culture mouth (which someone should have popped), but that he in fact causes more problems than he solves. Would it really be so much to ask if Mulan could have made the mistake that \\"gave away our position,\\" instead of having Mushu shoot off a rocket? At least that way, she's redeeming her own mistake, instead of someone elses, which gives no emotional payoff. Better yet, why not have the falcon find the line of troops--after all, that's what the falcon is for, right? It scouted earlier for the general's encampment and brought back the doll, remember?  Oh, and the cross-dressing thing at the end was a little too weird--a bit too Fushigi Yugi and not really very intelligent--do you honestly think that anybody would fall for that trick, even if they were really women (especially considering what the Monguls would have done).  The best parts of the movie were the references to Japanese cartoons (anime). When Mushu fries the feathers off of the falcon, it looks like a Chocobo from the Final Fantasy series, but is just as likely a reference to the horseclaws from Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (the director, apparently, is a devotee of Miyazaki). Another Nausicaa reference--the doll, which is similar to the one that Lord Yupa finds at the beginning of the Nausicaa movie (it crumbles, and Yupa says, \\"Another village has died.\\"). Also, Mulan's hair is given incredible attention, which is not usually the case in Disney films (usually they're just pretty and blow in the wind). Just watch her hair when she bows in shame after they find out she's a she!  Beyond that, there is a good deal of emotional content, though once the possibility of execution is lifted (a life for a life), it is never mentioned again--even though the overseer, who really hated her, could have had her executed at a moments notice once she caught back up with them. And I'm sorry, but for all their knowledge and art, the Chinese were rather steadfast about their ways and about honor--they would not suddenly become so accepting of women, especially since they are still rather unaccepting of women.

1587990717|5.0|This book is definitely one of the best books ever...I claim to be a mathematician somewhat having gained straight A's in pure and applied mathematics and advanced mathematics with (a boring) engineering degree at a number of UK univerisities, and after years of dabbling in options trading and having experienced first hand; Black Monday (black swan?), the Asian Economic Crisis, living in the epicentre of SARS (lucky to avoid it), and being in this market whilst we have one of the greatest financial crisis ever since the great depression..this book in my opinion is a real diamond and i reckon Taleb is a genius. I agree with his logic and found his book so good I just could not put it down.. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to find \\"direction in life\\"(there is none cos it may be random) or those who are going thru major change in life, or simply those who are bored with life and need another \\" angle\\"...I agree totally with his  analysis of noise vs market movements, and his view of how so many people misunderstand probablility and statistics...and yes I do have an MBA and did find the degree useless...this book \\"probably\\" would have been more useful in my career for sure! brilliant book!! Well done!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is amazing, at this late in the game I had no idea that Metallica had this left in them!  Hopefully they have a lot more of this in the tank!  Every track here is solid, standouts being \\"All Nightmare Long\\", \\"Judas Kiss\\" and \\"The Day that Never Comes\\".  Im sure the more I hear (you can't listen to this one, the sound is horrible) this album the more I'll come to appreciate the other songs..    That said, the mastering on this album is DISGUSTINGLY BAD, drum hits turn to mush (they sound like plastic plates!), and when the whole band kicks in the music makes a horrible distorted clipping noise NOT GOOD!    How a band with millions of dollars of recording budget, came out with an album that sounds WORSE than a lot of independent, unsigned bands with budgets of a thousand dollars or so blows me away.      The modern method of mastering everything loud, takes away dynamics and DESTROYS the music..  It's happened with so many bands this decade (some earlier).  MAKE IT STOP! PLEASE!
0375714839|4.0|This book provides an interesting way to read and learn about an interesting point in history. I highly recommend it or anyone to read because it's comic book style makes it an easy and enjoyable read.
B001DDBCUU|1.0|Okay, maybe it's my dvd player, but all my other dvd's play just fine, including the special disc 2 of this dvd. So disc 1 played once, and now refuses to play again in my dvd player. It will play on my I-Mac. I then went down to Longs and bought another \\"Sex & the City\\" widescreen dvd, not the special edition, and  this dvd won't play either. I'm out $45 and my wife isn't happy. I suspect they put some heavy duty Non-Copying code on this dvd and it's messing things up.
6302206294|3.0|The final verdict on ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES is that Kevin Costner is no Errol Flynn.  True, it is often unfair to compare a remake to a hugely successful original, especially since the goals of each are sometimes divergent.  In this case, however much I tried to see Costner's thoughful and intellectual Robin Hood as the driving force, I still harkened back to the sheer exuberance that Flynn invested his part.  Further, I could have lived with and even enjoyed on its own merits Costner's low key performance had it not been for the over the top campy performance of Alan Rickman as the wicked Sheriff of Nottingham.  With each time Rickman mugged for the camera, he became the focus of that scene.  Even when Costner and Rickman met several times, Costner's Robin Hood took a decided back seat to Rickman's Sheriff. As I compared Costner to Flynn, so did I compare Rickman to Claude Rains in THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST.  Rains's Sheriff was as equally oily as Rickman's, but Rains had the good sense to let Basil Rathbone do the sword play.  In PRINCE OF THIEVES, Rickman tries to do too much and to the extent that he succeeds the film reduces Costner to little more than a talky bystander.<br /><br />Still, PRINCE OF THIEVES is enjoyable as spectacle even if Rickman steals the show on too many occasions.
0553384775|5.0|I was surprised at how good this book was...it was exceptionally funny from start to finish and if you liked the movie Wall Street (\\"Greed is Good\\") and the book Liars Poker, you will love this book! This is definitely one of my Top 10 books ever read...considering what that guy has been through, it makes my (sometimes near death) life and financial experiences seem humorous! Great book to read on your holiday or during your run on treadmill in the corporate rat race!!! (Jordan - Thanks)
B000002LLC|3.0|I was nine-years-old when the Dick Tracy movie hit theaters in 1990. After seeing the movie, I scored a copy of the soundtrack on tape. Eighteen years later, I found myself wanting to sing along with Madonna's \\"More\\" lyrics. Favorites from the 12-song CD: Hanky Panky, Cry Baby, More, Now I'm Following You. Would recommend to a serious Madonna fan.
B000055X3U|5.0|Another great Cd from Anathema. Yes, the Floyd influence is apparent but this band has its own voice as well. Emotional, heartbreaking and atmospheric would be good adjectives to describe this music. Of special note is the stirring \\"One Last goodbye\\" . I don't think I have heard such a sad song since I heard Fates Warning's Guardian.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I loved the movie and the music so I bought this CD. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The music is phenomenal. Marc Anthony does Hector Lavoe some serious props here. Bravo Marc Anthony....the only disappointment here is the last trac, Jennifer Lopez's \\"Toma de Mi.\\" IT TRULY SUCKS! The song stinks and her vocals sound like someone is strangulating a Sea gull. This should of never been included in this CD....Other than JLo's lousy singing and song, the CD is great. Buy it and when you get to JLo's song, stop the CD....
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on tv.  Where are you going to find a show that consistantly relies on two leads to front it every single week?  The chemistry between Jensen (Dean) and Jared (Sam) is undeniable and has evolved with each season.      Even though season three was cut short because of the writer's strike, I think it is about the best season so far.  There are some superb performances including the episodes \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" - Jensen is so adorable and charming interacting with little Ben; \\"Bad Day at Black Rock\\" - Jared gives a great comedic performance with all the bad luck cursed upon him; \\"Mystery Spot\\" - Jared gives a definite heartfelt execution of a brother who has lost the only & most important person in his life...again and again.  Jensen gets to embrace his comedic side at times in this episode as well and it's great!; \\"Ghostfacers\\" - what can I say about this one other than I love Ed, Harry & the Ghostfacer gang they bring along to this reality inspired episode; \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" - Eric Kripke does the unthinkable and it helps Jensen with one of his best acting jobs thus far.  He gives us pain and agony like no other.    This show is by far my favorite and hopefully others will see it as outstanding and ingenious work.
0321544080|5.0|First of all, the pictures in this book are great, and for that alone it is worth buying.<br />With each picture Joe tells a small story on how he got to the picture. Some reviewers were expecting a closely detailed \\"how to\\", and this is not it.<br />But just as photography is not about the gear alone (a good camera does not automatically make you a good photographer), it is also not just about technique.<br /><br />So, there are no lighting diagrams in the book, no setups like \\"two flashes here and a reflector there\\". But a lot of tongue in cheek stories. Why film actors don't like their picture taken, how to get the right props, what NOT to do when shooting college sports stars, how to deal with police disrupting a shoot, etc.<br /><br />I once made a portrait of my coworkers son. She said it was his best portrait ever - showing his true smile and not the fake one he always had in pictures. This book will get you a feeling (among other things) on how to get that true smile out of people.
B001DPC52C|3.0|Within Temptation is one of my favorite bands and I was looking forward to this release.The concert and the production is lavish,no arguing there.Their songs,the orchestra and choir are magnificent.But the live sound of everything put together gets to be a bit too bombastic and the lead singer,Sharon doesn't have the strong professional voice to make herself really heard.And by the end of the concert,you can notice that she's really forcing her voice.I think this kind of production would be 10 times better if it was with a singer like Tarja Turunen.  Technical details,the sound quality is great and the venue is spectacular.  I would recommend this to WT fans,but not for the people who are looking for a real symphonic metal experience.For that,I'd say that Nightwish - End of an Era is so much better than this one.
B000OPO6VU|5.0|Back in the late 80s when the milky friends were loving all the men in tights hair bands, the grimace and I were getting our inspiration from ELP. ELP served as a blueprint for our band and that inspiration led us to strive to be a more experimental band. So I praise both ELP and the Grimace for helping me see the light and keeping me clear of the silly metal trap that \\"sad and irrelevant\\" has fallen into. And although Grimace is all but gone, he is not forgotten. This music should be treasured and should serve as the bluprint for bands out there.
015206396X|5.0|I loved this story. I thought it clever and touching and very entertaining. I loved the characters and the story was great. The only caution I have is that I thought the 'love' scenes were a bit graphic for younger readers. In fact, in my oppinion they move the book out of teen lit and into adult lit. I suggest parents read it themselves and then decide, but I think it is more for older teens and adults.
630469654X|4.0|In every way but one this movie is superlative.  There are the stunning visuals of the setting.  Three medieval castles were used to create the town of Aquila where the evil Bishop rules. I used to wonder how the filmmakers got that magical lighting, but the special feature on the DVD advised that the filming was done in Italy...of course.<br /><br />In this beautiful landscape, a pair of lovers struggle against the curse of the evil Bishop who lusted after the woman, aided by a petty thief and a drunken priest.  The action, the drama, the way the story unfolds grips the viewer as much on the tenth viewing as on the first.  Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful, angelic and fierce as the lady; Rutgar Hauer is dashing, noble and savage as the knight.<br /><br />Only Matthew Broderick could be cute enough in the role of Phillippe the Mouse, a pickpocket who escapes from the dungeons of Aquila.  His constant chatter forms an irritating, mundane counterpoint to the magical reality in which the story plays out.  I take a star off for this part of the script--the screenplay uses Mouse as a way to \\"tell but not show\\" parts of the story.<br /><br />The costumes and props are not designed to accurately portray any part of the Dark Ages but in every detail they contribute to this medieval story brought to life for the modern era. One of the most enduring visuals of this film is the knight on his beautiful black stallion Goliath. This horse, jet black with powerful floating gaits, was a real Friesian stallion named Othello.  I was disappointed that the special features of the DVD did not make any mention of him. As an enthusiast for the sport of dressage, I confess that one reason I bought this DVD is to be able to see this gorgeous horse perform.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I will keep this review short as so many people have left great reviews (and some bad) for this album.  This Is One of the Greatest ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!!!  I know that people compare  this album to their early stuff: Master Of Puppets and The Black Album.  But it's better than that and I think It's up there with Zepplin Four and AD/DC's Back In Black!!!  THe Best album of Metallica Has Ever Made. One Of The Best Hard Rock Of All Time!!!!    nuff said..............
B000VKW7AK|3.0|Start by saying this is a great 5 cd/dvd set.   the unreleased stuff is great, the dvd is amazing, the live at hammersmith is fantastic cd. many rare tunes to listen to.  BUT....more than half of this is available on the album releases.//why release a box set of stuff already released, th is I dont understand,...if your gonna release a 4 cd/dvd set,..pack it with stuff never released, japan bonus tracks, ALL demo material( from 82 to date )   studio sessions of songs not on the releases, or that didnt make the final cut to album, stuff that is not or may never be available again, t his set is great but more than half i already own on their releases.   Where is Killing is my business, and Hidden treasures w/ the Japanese bonus tracks. all the singles that have a different sound/producer, Megadeth has so much material, why not just release ALL OF IT for the fans that give Dave his nice home in the southwest, and pay for vacations and nice cars etc etc.  There is TONS of material out there by Megadeth,...so we will have to wait longer now for those lost gems.   but t his set is good for fans, I do enjoy it, albeit the shortcomings.
0375826726|5.0|I don't agree with the overly harsh critics who've nitpicked the book to death. I loved it! It was a great read, exciting and enthralling from beginning to end. I couldn't put the book down until I'd read the last page and it left me wanting more. What more can you ask of a great story? I am already impatient for the next book, and who cares if there are 4 instead of 3? More fun for us. It is a great adventure and I (unlike others) am not eager for it all to end. I look forward to the next book.    My only problems with the book, and they are minor, is that yes the opening sequence is pretty repulsive, didn't care for that. And secondly, I didn't like it that Eragon never checked on Elaine and tried to heal her or alleviate her discomfort. They mentioned several times how miserable she was and how dangerous her pregnancy was, but he just never got around to it and that bugged me.     Those two points aside, this is a great book. Buy it, Read it! You'll enjoy it and will be looking forward to the next one like I am.
B000XSWVEC|4.0|Great look into marching band competition.  Well acted.  Life lessons -- persistance, respect, focus on goals, team not individual, follow dreams, and more.  Great for pre-teens on up.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Ok, gay cowboys. I'd heard all the jokes. Still, this one is as good as you've heard. Sure, it gets a little icky here and there. And Jake really does look a little gay. I could barely understand Heath Ledger's cowboy accent, filtered through Aussie. Yet, the story is compelling, and the female stars as the wives are very good, indeed. Watch it. You won't be sorry.
0143142356|5.0|Having read \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" earlier this year, I didn't wait long to pick up this volume.  The first three hundred pages were very reminiscent of the first book, but then it came into its own.  Contrary to the few reviewers on this site who panned the book as dull and its characters as poorly developed, I enjoyed the book thoroughly.  In fact, this 60 year old college professor was very sad when the book ended.  I felt like I had lived the main characters lives with them and that I knew them like friends or relatives.  Yes, Follett inserted many anachronisms in speech and sensibility.  But the book makes you realize the humanity of those who lived in those days and the constraints they lived under.  The two main characters - Merthin and Caris - are very unusual in their times.  However, that makes them stand out in as individuals.  Most of their peers believed in spirits and potions.  The medieval doctors in the book believed in humors and bleeding, beliefs that lasted into the 18th century.  But there must have been many skeptics during this century, like the two protagonists.  To follow up on the novel, I'm re-reading Chaucer's \\"Canterbury Tales,\\" written later in the 14th century in which \\"World Without End\\" takes place.  The number of lecherous monks, adulterous wives and libidinous episodes is rather high in Chaucer.  The sophistication of the people narrating Chaucers \\"Tales\\" correlates well with the advanced consciousness of Follett's characters.  But Follett is writing in the 21st century, for us.  His novel speaks to us and is not intended to be limited to what was current thinking in 1360.  He is a great storyteller.  If you can't enjoy this book, I feel sorry for you.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|I think we can all safely say we've put that 2003 attempt at a Hulk movie out of our minds. Sure it was aweful, and made some of us sweat with sheer hatred at the boredom we suffered. When made aware of this film some simply sighed and said, \\"keep Ang Lee as far away as possible\\" he's a great director but isn't a comic book movie maker. This adaptation wasn't a sequel, nor was it a reinvention, it was simply a nudge in the right direction and had Louis Leterrier say this is how it should have been done.<br /><br />Ed Norton now takes the role as Bruce Banner and is supported by the sexually appealing Liv Tyler. Yes, I said sexually appealing. The film starts off in Brazil where Bruce is hiding from the United States army and keeping the Hulk at bay. He works in a bottling plant and one day cuts himself leaving a drop of blood in one of the bottles, which makes an un-witting Stan Lee very ill indeed. By the way, off topic a little but can Stan Lee please stop with the cameos. Yeah, we get it Stan, you came up with the characters it doesn't mean you have to appear in every single Marvel movie ever made.<br />Back on topic. The Army track Bruce through the sick Stan Lee and employ Emil Blonsky, a man who's very high ranking in the British Royal Marines and is entrusted to bring Banner back to the states. Things don't go too well and the Hulk is awakened and destroys the soldiers, escaping once again. Blonsky isn't happy and with the help of General Thadeus Ross, he is put in the super soldier program for round two with the Hulk.<br />Meanwhile, Banner wants a cure for the Hulk so he seeks out Betty Ross to help him cure himself along with the help of the mysterious Mr. Blue.<br /><br />I can't really go further into the story as it all comes together at the end in one excellent climax, but as you can see in the cover it involves Abomination in some way. In my review title I mention that this is a nod to everything Hulk and I wasn't kidding. Just the little things you tend to notice more if they're familiar to you. The nod to the TV show with Lou Ferrigno having a cameo and a nod to the games in the final scene, Hulk smashes a police car in two and uses the parts as make shift boxing gloves. Comparing it to the first movie, this has definitely taken more inspiration from the comics. Utilising comic villains and giving a possible hint to a villain in a future installment. The look and general feel of the film are very cartoon like but are still very cool.<br /><br />Hopefully this, along with Iron Man will lead to much more comic inspired comic book movies being made. Sure, you can give us a comic movie with the main hero, but it's not really a comic movie if you take that character and change the world around them. A very enjoyable movie and worth the time, especially for the end fight sequence between Abomination and Hulk.hey're familiar to you.

B00009W0U4|5.0|I just finished watching this film, and I found it to be more different than any movie I have ever seen. As other reviewers have said, the story plot is told in reverse. The urban feel of it appealed to me, the setting so to speak. The actors were brilliant in this. I have never seen such strong emotional parts being played. At first, I really wondered what was going on with the camera moving all kind of ways showing walls, street scenes, and a man raging with anger. The raging man, Marcus, played by Vincent Cassel really drew me into the film. I didn't want to stop watching.     Many have given the story plot here in reviews, so I really do not need to go back over that. If you do decide to watch this move, make sure you can handle realistic graphic scenes. There is not a cut and dry here. It is an 'in your face' type of movie. There is nothing left to the imgination when it comes to the rape scene or anything else. You can almost feel what is happening. It challenged me emotionally as well as psychologically.    As the story ended, that is when I felt attached to Alex played by Monica Bellucci. I saw a beautiful happy woman face torment, but never knew the real Alex till the end.     As for the director, Gaspar Noe, I really think he was challenging the viewer. Sometimes we do not want to face reality, and he makes you face it straight on. If you are an emotional person, this will touch you in many ways. I got to say, it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It is a very different type of film and the ending is wild. I do not know another word for the ending.     In closing, I would like to say Mr. Noe was very creative and artistic in his use of the camera. It is just brilliant work by him!! The acting is surperb. This is NOT a film for the squeamish.
0307455874|1.0|I expected a little less fluff and a little more substance. I was greatly disappointed.
B00139W3NE|5.0|Unfortunately, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials never gained the  fame and mass following of JKR's Harry Potter.  But his series was one  of my favorites as a child, and now this first movie is a visual treat,  and welcome reminder of how wonderful the books were.    Unfortunately, we marketed the movie all wrong in the US, and labeling  the series as the \\"anti-Narnia chronicles\\" did not help boost its  popularity among the audience here, which reveres CS Lewis's creation.   Please understand, there is nothing about His Dark Materials that  detracts from the wonder and Christian themes found in Narnia.  If  anything, having read the two series side by side as a kid, I was able  to appreciate the parallels between stories, as well as the different  worldviews of each author.    I think children and adults alike will enjoy this movie tremendously,  regardless of religion or worldview, regardless of whether or not they  have read the books.  My boyfriend was not familiar with the series,  but enjoyed it as much as I did.  In fact, he was the one who informed  me that the next 2 movies are not currently in production, as it  failed to crack $70 million in the domestic box office despite huge  success overseas.  In fact, it is the first film to ever crack $300  million internationally without reaching $100 million domestic.  An  astonishing disconnect, really.    The producer has vowed to make the 2nd and 3rd movies, and I'm  crossing my fingers they do a better job marketing the movie (and that  critics aren't so quick to trash it!)  This series has real potential.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Let's put this behind us: the Godfather was, is and will always be 'grainy'. It's just the way they were shooting movies THIRTY-SIX YEARS AGO. So, yes, it's a 36 year old movie and it looks its age. It's true, '2001' looks a lot better on blu but, apparently, that's the best that could be extracted from the existing Godfather negatives - there is an entire 'extra' that explains how the transfer was done and the sometimes painful choices the restorers had to make. The transfer is grainy all over. It's grainy all the time. The whites are grainy and so are the blacks. In the end, it does not really matter or it didn't matter much to me because it's better than anything I've seen yet.<br /><br />Moving beyond grainyness, the picture is steady like rock. I wasn't able to detect any major artifacts. The extra available on 'disk 4', showing the kind of work and the technology invested into this product convinced me that this is the best-looking Godfather except maybe the first screening at the Chinese theater in Hollywood that we are going to see in a long, long time. [A post blu-ray 'better' edition is possible in 10 years or so, when blu-ray is surpassed by a new technology, because the best negatives found were digitized on a resolution that's about 3 times higher than the current blu-ray.]<br /><br />No major complaints about the sound. It's TrueHD 5.1, it's clear but don't expect any surround effects. I doubt the original was even stereo. It was a little bit low-volume on my stereo but it's probably my equipment to be blamed.<br /><br />The extras on the 4th disk are actually worth watching. They are shot in HD. There's one where just about all major elderly and late-middle-age Hollywood directors and stars show up and say something, there's one about the restoration itself, a little short where some younger artists appear and say funny things. Overall... not too bad. Oh, besides the HD's, you also get the extras from the 2001 DVD edition and THAT's where you see the difference between Blu and the (previous) DVD version.<br /><br />Now, for the bloopers section, get this: the blu-ray comes with the plastic disk case inside a cardboard boxy sleeve (very nice) but... there's also a nice 12-page brochure with the pictures of Coppola, Pacino, Brando and information on the contents of each of the 4 disks - coffee table style. Well... the brochure was meant to fit inside that cardboard sleeve, next to the plastic blu-ray disk case but it comes actually GLUED to the cardboard case because... it's too big. Someone forgot that the blu-ray cases are a bit smaller than the DVD's and, apparently, the brochure was supposed to be a 'one size fits all' kind of deal that doesn't fit the blu-ray. Sad.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the Blu Godfathers. While, yes, the picture is grainy and the transfer does not look like the Transformers or Ratatouille, not even like '2001', the blu-ray does look a lot better than the DVD version. This rendition of the Godfathers has many defects, it's far from perfect but, as far as I know, it's the best there is. I do not regret making the purchase.<br /><br />I took away one star for the little brochure snafu and for the relatively high price (likely to go down) at release time.nd the (previous) DVD version.

1400032717|4.0|I often worry that these books with a lot of buzz won't live up to the hype by the time I get around to reading them.  In this case, I shouldn't have worried. From his prime-numbered chapters to his reasons why he doesn't like the colors yellow and brown, Haddon's autistic narrator is full of his own charm, even if he couldn't tell you what charm was.  You can't help but feel for this boy who wants to find out who killed his neighbor's dog, thinks his mother is dead, and lacks the filter we take for granted to see and hear only that which is important to us. From time to time you may get bogged down in Christopher's factual digressions and descriptions, but it's not long before you're caught back up in his story.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I'm completely addict at this TV-Show. I love the story, the characters, the actors. The season 3 is my favorite season with the season 2. If you don't know Supernatural you have to try to watch it, I think you'll love it. Sorry for my bad english my first language is french.
0316143472|1.0|I have found that if I wouldn't want the author of a book of essays as a dinner guest, I won't like the book.  The author of this comes across as shallow, superficial, and whiny - not your ideal dinner guest.  Saying negative things about yourself is only funny if the audience DOESN'T believe its true.  I admit I only got about 1/3 of the way through this book; it just didn't seem likely to improve THAT much in last 2/3.<br /><br />I would instead recommend  \\"What on Earth Have I Done?: Stories, Observations, and Affirmations\\" by Robert Fulghum as a much more positive and enjoyable book.
015206396X|4.0|From what it says on the jacket flap, you just can't help but go, \\"Whoa, I wanna know what comes next!\\" Or at least that's what happened to me.     Can I just first say how much of an interesting book this is? Dude, my mom had to pry it out of my hands to make me stop reading since I had school in the morning and it was like 1:30.    The whole book is narrated in third person but it works out perfectly. I think one of the best ways to describe this book is that everything is not what it seems. And that is both a good and bad thing. So, it keeps you on your toes.    Also, in two scenes it gets pretty... intimate if you know what I mean. But it's vague enough so it doesn't scar you for life and it stays in the YA genre but it's detailed enough so you know what's going on. Just a heads up for you!     It's broken up into three parts and the whole book is 471 pages. A pretty decent sized book which took me about a day and a half not including school because I was really paranoid that the book was going to get ruined because I really like the cover art. How much of a dork am I?    In the beginning we see Katsa and we meet a character that will play a major part in the book, but I won't tell who, you people are smart, you can figure it out in the up-coming chapters. And he is not what he seems either, but he is still a good guy.    The story captivates the reader and makes them eager for more. Which luckily there will be a sequel coming in the future. The sense of adventure and tension and suspense is there also along with the parts that make you smile and just go, \\"Aw.\\" But there are some parts of tragedy. But not the moments where you want to sob into your pillow and scream to the heavens, \\"WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!\\" but the types where you just have pity for the characters and hope for the best.     I am trying to keep this review spoiler free but there are some things I was like, \\"I wish ______\\" But that isn't what the character would do so, you just have to let it go.    I would give this book a 4.5 stars! I totally recommend this book. It has romance, adventure, suspense, and memorable characters with distinct personalities. Like the back of the jacket said, it definitely left me wanting more. And I bet you will to, so go on and read it!
0307269752|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a multi-layered mystery that fascinates and enthralls.  Swedish author Stieg Larsson ratchets the anxiety level to such an intense level that at one point I literally had to put the book down in mid-sentence and walk away for several hours until I had calmed down.<br /><br />The book revolves around a classic locked-door mystery:  in 1966 Harriet Vanger, the 16-year-old niece and surrogate daughter of Henrik Vanger, CEO of the Vanger Corporation, disappeared from Hedeby Island, a private island owned by the Vanger family.  At the time of Harriet's disappearance the single bridge leading to the island was blocked by a major traffic accident that occupied most of the island's inhabitant's, meaning that Harriet is not missed at first.  All boats--the only other way off the island--are all accounted for.  Despite an exhaustive search, no trace of Harriet is ever found and she is presumed dead.  Henrik, is convinced that Harriet has been murdered by a member of the Vanger family, a conviction that grows when, on his birthday he receives a pressed flower, dried and framed, mailed to him anonymously.  Harriet had given him a pressed, dried and framed flower every birthday since she was eight years old.  As this continues every year, Henrik's obsession with the missing Harriet grows until it consumes him, leaving little time or attention for business, particularly when the family seems determined to sink the family-owned corporation.  He retires, leaving control of once powerful, now much diminished, Vanger Corporation to Martin, Harriet's brother.<br /><br />Now, on his eighty-second birthday, after the receipt of yet another flower, with the finality of death approaching, Henrik decides to make one, last-ditch effort to solve the mystery of Harriet's murder.  He hires Mikael Blomkvist, under the cover of writing a family history to conduct an investigation.  At first blush, Blomkvist appears to be a poor choice:  he has just been convicted of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m, a powerful businessman.  His reputation as a journalist been destroyed, the fine he has been assessed threatens to demolish his finances and a combination of the two is likely enough to bring down Millennium, the magazine he co-founded, co-owns and edits.  He is also facing a prison as part of the verdict.  Yet oddly enough, Blomkvist put on no defense.<br /><br />The title-character is Lisbeth Salander, a freelance investigator for Milton Security.  An unnerving bundle of contradictions:  Lisbeth spent several years of her adolescence in a locked psychiatric ward.  She is considered retarded and incompetent by the State and as a result was placed under a guardianship.  In fact Lisbeth is a brilliant investigator who has demonstrated an uncanny talent in ferreting out other people's secrets--despite a pathological hatred for authority figures.  She, or rather Milton Security, is hired by Henrik Vanger to investigate Mikael Blomkvist. Her job is abruptly ended when Blomkvist accepts Henrik's job offer, but by that point Lisbeth is intrigued by what she has already learned.<br /><br />The stories of the Vanger family, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are interwoven, the past and the present coming together piece by piece until the final masterpiece is complete.  The end result is too complex to compare it to a picture--it is more like a sculpture, something that you can turn this way and that, to look at from different angles to a different point of view.  It is a novel that requires thinking about.<br /><br />The good news is that this is the first in the Millennium trilogy.  The bad news is that Stieg Larsson passed away in 2004, cutting short a truly remarkable and worthy life.  His work makes clear that he was a man of ideals, although The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo gets across the issues--racism, violence against women--without being heavy handed about it.  No surprise that he spent his career fighting againstright-wing extremist and racism.  For those interested, check out stieglarsson.com.e interested, check out stieglarsson.com.
B00007KLJJ|5.0|This Rendition offers an exceptional interpretation which clearly surpasses all previous movies of the same title and we found it to be a most absorbing and moving story. This is due to the extraordinary talent of Heath Ledger.
0670020745|4.0|The author, a trained brain scientist (neuroanatomist) experienced a stroke when a blood vessel broke in the left (rational, detail and time-oriented) side of her brain.  Meanwhile, the right (intuitive, kinesthetic, nonverbal communication) side felt euphoric.  That observation may be very helpful for others understanding what may be happening to them, and in choosing the correct reaction.<br /><br />It took the author eight years to fully heal.  At first she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life.  The ensuing confusion and memory losses were illustrated by her taking 45 minutes to call for help, and inability to speak intelligibly.  She also experienced great difficulty understanding what people wanted, and were saying to her.  She gave up after several hours trying to answer \\"Who is President of the U.S.?\\"<br /><br />The good news is that recovery began almost immediately.  At the end of day two she could roll over and stand up - with support.  Her mother became her caretaker.  A friend brought over children's books and puzzles - while helpfully, at first they were very frustrating (could not do a 12-piece puzzle).  She slowly learned to read again, learn the ins and out of walking (the edge of a sidewalk could be a danger, lines in the middle were not).<br /><br />Important needs included people talking confidently about her recovery, focusing herself on recovery - its work, and takes one away from serenity, requirement for plenty of sleep for healing, needing goals, and focusing on achievement and not disability.  After three months the author learned to drive again, and in six months was able to make a limited professional presentation.  However, it took until the fourth year until she could handle additional again.<br /><br />The downside to \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" is an over-focus on feelings and emotion, rather than rational analysis and presentation - undoubtedly because it was the rational part of her brain that was damaged.
159562015X|5.0|This is a very interesting book. It allows you to discover talents about yourself you were not aware of. I highly recommend this book, since it opens your eyes to skills that you already had, things you did and never thought of as a skill you carried.
B000E5N6LG|1.0|Among the unintentional laughs was the dramatic walk to the OK Corral by the Earps and Doc Holliday.  This should have been released as a comedy.  Another flawed, but still excellent, version of the Earps was \\"Tombstone.\\"
0375826726|5.0|I just don't understand why everybody hates this book. From my POV, I love the discriptions. I love long books I can take forever ro read, I read each page, and on pages that are very discriptive, I read them again. Personaly, I loved teh character development. I mixed my love for fantasy with my love for knowledge. I like to know the interworkings over every last thing there is to do with a book I love. The worst thing that will happen for me in the cycle, is when it ends.     Paolini got me with book one, and I havn't stoped loving it since. I reread all of them when I'm bored and don't have a new novle to engross myself in. To me, Paolini does exactly what I want him to, discribe things so that I can see them, feel then, smell them, hear them. I like to be in the book. I like to forget I'm reading and look left and see the person speaking back to me. But thats just me. I do this with all my books.    Overall, I loved the book for just about everything. I gave it 5 stars cuz I could warrent 4.  There were only minor devices I didn't like, and they were just from a taste view, and I just could imagin saying someone was a bad writer because it didn't match my taste. The main thing I didn't like was the ending to this book. It left way to much open, even for a cliff hanger. Another few pages 10 or 20 at most, and it would have wraped up nicly. But to leave them like he did was just to open.    So read it. Love it. Live it!
0143038419|5.0|We've all had that moment when we're so low the baseboards look like levees.  If you haven't been there, then you need to be prepared.  I read this book after years of healing from an awful breakup.  The thread of emotion that has remained from that seven year relationship is now just a small part of the fabric of my life that I lead now.  This book helped me to see that and I am very grateful to the friend that suggested I read it.

B000JVSUS4|1.0|Pearl Harbor, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have seen. I have read may of the reviews by other members, and the derogatory comments they have made about the film, and yes, from their point of view, they are correct.  What you have to understand before you can really appreciate a film like this is that although part of the plot is fiction, the rest is not. This means that the creators have to make the film fit into the framework of established historical fact. Not only the historic lines, but also the culture, the attitude of people in general, and the overall norms of that time.  With this premise out of the way, I found the film to be very entertaining, romantic, and extremely authentic as far as props, attitudes, and historic content. It was a well spent three hours that I would do again.  For me, it really answered many questions I had about the WWII era that in my personal research, I could not answer. In addition, being a hopeless romantic, I really loved the story, which was authentic for that time, as to how people acted.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head have had a bit of an up-and-down career, with a few missteps along the way, but when they're firing on all cylinders, you better get out of their way.  Leader and vocalist Robb Flynn, possibility the angriest metaller out there right now, is a superb songwriter, which is too often overlooked in metal circles, with many outfits getting attention with unimaginative repetitive riffs and singers who sound like they're suffering from a bad case of irritable bowel syndrome.<br />  Flynn does his share of growling, but also provides clear vocals and harmonies, which add the one element modern metal needs the most, dynamics.  Not that \\"The Blackening\\" is a wimped out affair.  This slab is heavy - like the Titanic sinking in your living room heavy.  The guitar work though, is innovative, uses lots of cool bends ala Tony Iommi and some of the best lead work out there.<br />  Every track is great, but a few really stick out, which is no small feat in a CD of such strong material.  \\"Halo\\", \\"Slanderous\\" and \\"Wolves\\" are personal favorites.  If Machine Head keep this level of metal up, they will be almost untouchable.  Give me Robb Flynn over the over blown and bloated Metallica any day.
0061120073|5.0|I only recently got around to reading Betty Smith's 1943 memoir-cum-novel A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, mainly because it had a reputation as an Oprah Winfrey sort of book, meaning I thought it must be one of those tomes filled with good intentions but short on literary merit. After all, the first mention of it I can recall was a snide comment in an old Bugs Bunny cartoon from the 1940s. Boy, do I love to be wrong about things like this. The novel is a total masterpiece. At almost 500 hundred pages there is not a thing I'd cut- not a chapter, paragraph, sentence, nor word. It is a work of fiction the equal of Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, and some other great works like John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath, Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, Charles Johnson's Oxherding Tale, and the best of Kurt Vonnegut and William Kennedy. In fact, it might be the best of the bunch.<br /><br />  In fact, it's more than great literature. It personally resonates with me because its depth and narrative immersion in a bygone world rivals that of the best of memoirs, including my own True Life series. I include it, now, along with Walt Whitman's Leaves Of Grass, Alex Haley's The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, Leonard Shlain's Art And Physics, Loren Eiseley's autobiography All The Strange Hours, and Terry Matheson's Alien Abductions, as the most personally influential and resonant books I have read. Aside from that it is a perfect example of what the publishing industry used to do right versus what it does wrong now.<br /><br />  In many ways ATGIB is a very similar story to 1996's Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt. The later book follows a poor Irish American boy who will grow up to be a writer for his first nineteen or so years, while this book chronicles a poor Irish-German American girl who will grow up to be a writer for her first sixteen or so years. AA is set three decades later and the family goes from America to Ireland, and then Frankie goes back to America, while Francie Nolan remains in Brooklyn, until heading off for college at novel's end. Both books feature strong mothers who endure alcoholic husbands, and both books have colorful families to sketch, as well as great poverty, but ATGIB is a far superior book to AA. Primarily this has to do with editing. AA is a 450 page book that could have been 300 pages, and included far more. But, in it, McCourt tends to ramble on far too much, and recount far too similar stories, with the effect of boring you. His book revels in suffering for suffering's sake. ATGIB, was submitted as a memoir, but the editor urged Smith to make it a novel, which helped her flesh out the characters and smooth over rough spots. It worked, for ATGIB is a compelling, poetic, and multifarious work, where AA is a spotty work of unrealized potential. I submit these two books as Exhibits A and B in the case of poor editing for most current books' being so poorly written, rather than just bad writers.<br />  The book ends with Katie Nolan accepting a marriage proposal from a retired police sergeant and widower who has long been enamored with her. He offers to adopt Francie's youngest sister Annie Laurie and to send Neeley and Francie to college. Francie readies to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan to attend the University of Michigan. As she stops past her old apartment building she sees the cut down but still growing Tree Of Heaven resprouting in the tenement yard. She sees a small girl named Florrie Wendy, for whom the tree will also come to represent something, just as it must have represented something to her older neighbor girl Flossie Gaddis before her. That all three girls have names that start with F is not coincidental. That the tree that is chosen as the titular tree is a nondescript tree is all the more apt. It is, along with Melville's white whale, one of the greatest metaphors in fiction. Yet, even as the book ends the reader wants to know more of what will happen in Francie's life, even thoughnone doubts she will perdure.<br /><br />  I am eager to read other of Smith's novels, to see if this was merely part of a continuum, or some great work that rose far beyond any other in her oeuvre. The scenes she so deftly set in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn are indelible, and even if her other works are not on par, this book alone is one of those near-miraculous things that justifies the 99.9% of bad arts being out there. Now, back to the crap!ll perdure.      I am eager to read other of Smith's novels, to see if this was merely part of a continuum, or some great work that rose far beyond any other in her oeuvre.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|This album should have come out 15 years ago. Where have these guys been?  Busy making money and sueing Napster?     In spite of good come back, 3 stars only. Lyrics sucks compared to earlier (glory) days and even to LOAD. Lars drumming for changing rythm is awful. Why he decided to do this - I simply do not comprehend. Couple songs start really good and then it comes... distorted sounds. They would be better off just continue as they started. I guess Metallica wants to prove that they are as good as before but the truth is; they are not. First part of the album is done with a lot of pretence: we can change the rythm, we can change the structure, we can make it complex, we can can make it comprised, we can jam as the old days but it does nor deliver the  message and the listener is lost. Second part is more linear and is so much better. It sounds more of Metallica 83-88 and that is what these guys traded away for money: making each album 2-5 years apart, not doing hard work and the talent is eventually gone. Just the technique which is left.    Sad but true.
B00004WF68|3.0|Most songs on this album are psychedelic curiosities. Many songs lack the melody and tunefulness that Steve and the gang can produce in droves. I liked this album when I was in college and was exploring all sorts of late sixties albums and...lots of other things. Many of those albums from the era did hold up over time. This one doesn't.
B00005221M|3.0|Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) falls in love with Cora (Madeleine Stowe), while serving as a guide for the British army during the French and Indian War. On the plus side, the cinematography is gorgeous and the story maintains a reasonable degree of historical accuracy, at least by Hollywood standards. But this is also \\"epic filmaking\\" at it's most melodramatic and overwrought. For example, there is tons of slow-motion camera work, usually of DDL running through the wilderness or making some impossibly accurate rifle shot.    In addition, the characters lack nuance, with Nathaniel depicted as a hero of near mythic proportions and Magua (Wes Studi) as the evil, treacherous Huron villan. To the film's credit, the British were shown to have a few \\"bad guys\\" as well, including Cora's father Colonel Munro. Also the Huron's chief castigates Magua for his vengeful excesses and going against the \\"Huron Way\\". So at least the entire tribe is not shown to be villanous.     If you like epic Hollywood film making, full of romance, action and melodrama, then you will likely appreciate this movie, as it is well made for a film of this type. But for folks like me, who prefer a simpler and more realistic style of film making, it will only be of moderate interest.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I tend to be a bit of a slacker sometimes when working out. This video is great for the days that I want a short full body work out because it includes every muscle. However, because it is a short full body work out it's very intense. But that's what it takes to see results in such a short work out.
B00000J2KV|5.0|This movie is funny, intense, and pure greatness. Almost as good as the book. A lot less sexual than the book Lolita. Even though this movie is black and white it somehow feels colorful because of Lolita's personality.
0316010669|2.0|Let me start by saying that each chapter in the book is very interesting, easy to read and engaging. A real page turner from this point of view.    Now, having said that, as a whole I couldn't see what was the author getting at through the book. The book starts with the premise that some people can make a snap decision about something and be right, which is interesting. But then, the book goes into chapter after chapter of examples on exemptions to this. Which at the end feels like the original premise is completely false. The only conclusion I could get is that some expert in something might be able to make a quick decision and be right, which is mostly chance alone.    So in essence I found this book to be mostly unimportant.
B0019OP0GU|5.0|This movie isn't what I would call a \\"chick flick\\", but it is wonderful for Mothers and Daughters.  This is a very sweet story of success if family and friends come together to support each other.  It has some very purposeful messages, especially to young women, who allow their success in life to overcome who they really are.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and bought it the first day it came out.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I really didn't intend to like this movie. I mean the series was great and I didn't think they could do any better. Well I was wrong. I loved this movie. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me wish I had three great girlfriends.  And the clothes (and the shoes) - to die for! I think it was an excellent end to one of my favorite series. Anyone who didn't like it was never a true fan.
0439813786|4.0|This book is about a boy who lives in a station in Paris. He fixes clocks and works with machinery. He has to bear the weight of his drunk, absent uncle from whom Hugo took the responsibility of keeping the clocks of the station working. His father had found an automaton, which is a machine that can move and perform abilities, but all through the machinery of a clock. This particular automaton is of a man at a desk, posed as if to write something. This story is about the boy trying to find what the automaton of a man is writing when he is fixed.   I loved the illustrations in the book. What is interesting about this book is it is not written like a traditional graphic novel, but it has writing on a few pages, then the next few pages will be illustrations of the next part of the book. The author does not illustrate what he had explained in words, but what happens next. The pictures continue the story where the words leave off. The pictures tell their own part of the story. It is such a creative style of writing and illustrating. The author weaves such an interesting story, but it is his illustrations that make this novel so fascinating and compelling. The illustrations are drawn in a kid- friendly way, but they still contain depth and it looks to me that the author took a lot of time for just one of them.  It only took about an hour or two to read, but it was exciting until the very end. The book has 550 pages, but 284 of the pages are pictures. The plot is a combination of mysteries and secrets that all want to be solved.

Like her, I do not find \\"animal\\" stories on the top of my list, so a dog on the cover would never have intrigued me.   Like her, also, I found this story to be a human story, seen through the eyes of an animal.  I absolutely loved it.  My daughter loved it,too, and recommended it to my college age son.  I'm also recommending it to my book club. Ran the gamut of emotions, laugh-out-loud and cry really hard. Enjoy!

B000FP2OPY|5.0|In season one of most series, you're sort of getting a lot of bits and peices.  Mostly because the bulk of the money and imagination was spent on the pilot before the networks decide to pick up certain shows.  If you're not a patient person, or really into the genre of this show then you probably won't be blown away.  It is worth the watch though, even if this is not your kind of show.  If for no other reason, simply because of the leads Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles.  The latter really is a truly gifted actor with mannerisms and a persona that really make his character of Dean believable.  Jared comes into his own as Sam also.  But watching for the different directors in each episode and their styles is also fun.  And once you begin to see where the creators and writers are taking you with the mythology of this series, you really get hooked.  It's because they somehow manage to make a weekly creature-feature and include the over-arching story line in every episode at the same time.  And it's nice to be able to tell when the people involved seem to enjoy making the show as well, as is evident in Supernatural.  And it only gets better as the series progresses through seasons.
B0013ND30W|4.0|It's strange that they would release this on Platinum Edition now when they just released a \\"Special Edition\\" a few years ago.  That release was pretty much on the \\"Platinum\\" status to me. They should have done this then.  Maybe this is part of their plan of releasing their classics every 7 to 8 years.  I guess they started a little early with this one.  I heard they'll be releasing Beauty and the Beast again in a couple of years, so I guess we're beginning another cycle of paying for things we already own. I'm talking about the DVD fanatics, of course.  This is still a maybe for me since I have the other version, but I'm still glad they're putting it out again for the future generation.  I grew up with it. Others should too.  The only cons of this movie: kinda hollow of a movie if you think about it, and the Prince doesn't have any lines at the finale, which was rather strange and awkward to me.  Still, one of the best Disney films of all time.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I'm seldom moved to offer reviews since I will only do so when I have unusually high praise to offer. In this case, I really do. The Gaslight Anthem is a terrific band, and this is one of the very best albums I've heard in the last five years.    It's all here; the song writing and the musicianship are top notch, the production is exciting, and the music ... well, there are lots of obvious influences here - The Clash, Springsteen, Lou Reed, Tom Petty - but the result is an instant classic filled with rhapsodic passion, edgy toughness, and rock poetry. Really, you can ride this one all over town. It really doesn't get better.     They should be stars - they're already my heroes.    Joe Strummer is smiling.
0375424474|5.0|In terms of physical makeup, how did human beings get to be what they are? In order to provide some answers, the author's journey of discovery took him to a remote site in the Arctic to look for fossils. This site fit the requirements of containing exposed sedimentary rocks dating back some 370 million years ago, to the time when previously found fossils begin to show terrestrial rather than purely aquatic adaptations. With a combination of luck and skill, he succeeded in finding what he was looking for: the fossil remains of a creature that had the anatomy not quite of a fish but not quite of a land animal either. From that starting point, the author provides anatomical examples of how human adaptations - everything from limbs to teeth to the inner ear - can be seen to have evolved from much simpler organisms.    The study of fossils and anatomy does have its limitations in that only gross similarities can be noted; the process itself is hidden; and there is not much that can be done experimentally. But the subject matter can be approached from a different angle. The author recounts initial experimental methods in embryology that found an \\"organizer\\" site of cells that appears to control growth in embryos. When these types of cells of one species were substituted for another, they still enacted their role of organizing. Significant progress since the 1980s in genetics, especially the discovery of the Hox gene, has unlocked the role of DNA in explaining how the \\"organizer\\" works. Scientists can then search out the similarities of DNA in different species.    The author combines his knowledge of paleontology and anatomy with genetics and molecular biology to posit how single celled organisms could have developed the means to combine together over time to the point of developing bodies. The details here are rather sketchy - as this book is a primer not a technical work. The study is limited to a discussion of how certain anatomical structures developed as life becamemore complex. It is interesting to consider the external circumstances that were at work. The primary motivation for assuming more complexity appears to be the desire to evade predators. The first appearance of bodies appears to have coincided with a noticeable increase in oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.    One note: This book is about science not religion, but I could not help but being struck by an analogy the author draws between developing life and the construction of a building: the role of DNA in the cells of a body is analogous to there being a blueprint of a building in every brick. In other words, instead of the plans coming from the outside, life develops from plans from within. On the basis of this insight, it should be fair to say that intelligence has to be inside rather than outside; that is, the Intelligent Designer is not separate and apart from all of Creation.
B001EN71DG|1.0|This impending re-release of the same DVD's is sure to infuriate fans, but is this surprising to anyone? Nope. Lucasfilm is a business, and George Lucas is all about business, not about the fans, but to sell more product. What is it the fans want? The original, unaltered trilogy but with remastered picture and sound, and special features galore, including deleted scenes. Sure, Lucasfilm could easily do this, creating a true \\"ultimate edition\\" - but, these flimsy re-releases still sell, so if they release the ultimate edition, especially on Blu-ray, these fans will have all they want. Lucasfilm will sell these well, but it doesn't bode well for the future. That's why they continue to sell these on DVD only, and in about five years (as another on Amazon has commented on) they will finally come to Blu-ray, but - I guarantee it - they will only be the special edition versions that the fans do not want. It's the never-ending cycle.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am enjoying this miniseries very much.  I am and have been a fan of John and Abigail for many years.  I have several books about both of them.  So to sit and watch the events unfold on the CD is a real treat.  I think the acting is great.  I am comparing the miniseries to the McCullough book to see how closely it follows the book.  So far so good.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Anything Metallica did before the black album was crap!!!!. Hetfield sounded like a pimply youth on the earlier albums. He has learned to use his voice in a unique way, that is both beautifull and powerfull. The music is also much better technically and the songs are more cleverly constructed.
B00000DC10|5.0|I think Refused made a mistake when they picked the title of this album, because no one will ever be able to make this type of music. I've been listening to music since 2000, I've heard so many great albums, including Nirvana's, but never felt like learning guitar until I discovered Refused this year and heard this album.
B0015519VS|1.0|I have been a fan of Usher since 8701.  I was very excited to hear Usher was back with a new album after taking some time off to start a family and work on other projects.  When I heard \\"Love in This club\\" on the radio I thought WOW! Usher is back at the top!  I bought the cd the day it came out. When i got home i put it in my cd player and listened to the whole thing, and was disapointed. I figured it was just because I didn't know the songs, and had to listen to it a few times...  I've had the cd for about 4-5 months now, and have listened to it many times trying my best to find something I like about it, and just can't.  The only songs i do like out of 17 are,   \\"Love in This Club\\", Trading Places, and the intro \\"Prayer for you\\" with his son.
B001F0ORDU|5.0|I love the series and the movie gave me a great fix!! I went through so many emotions throughout this movie. I hope they come up with another one. Sex and the City represented well. As the other people before me stated....so worth the wait!!!!
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Pink Floyd fans have been on a roller coaster of emotions in the first part of the 21st Century, and this excellent document takes us back to An Island of Pink Floyd and Gilmour/Wright magic one last time. It is the final encore for Richard Wright, one of the greatest (and humblest) musical geniuses of all time (despite being a founding member of Pink Floyd and deserving a co-billing with David Gilmour, he chose to let David Gilmour have sole billing)and the last spark of the Pink Floyd magic flame, which has sadly gone out at this time with the passing of Wright. David Gilmour still has many great albums in him, and Roger Waters is still making new music, but without Wright, there will be no more great Floyd music.   In 2005, Floyd fans got a surprise that brought our moods up and raised our hopes when the classic line up got together one last time at Live 8. Even though it was a farewell performance, there was a chance another world changing event would bring the band back together for another brief performance.  Then the first sucker punch of Syd Barrett's passing smashed away the mysterious character that we all hoped would at least come out one last time to play something before going into hiding again. That would never happen now.   Then, David Gilmour's On An Island hit the shelves. I bought it just because I am a fan of PF and wanted to see what Gilmour was up to. I expected it to be a decent album. It was not. It was an outstanding album that, despite not being called Pink Floyd, was more like pink Floyd's classic sound that anything since Wish You Were Here. It hearkened back to Pre DSOTM Floyd in a big way. It was another great peak on the roller coaster ride. There was still more to go, though, as Remember That Night came out with an excellent show and appearances, for one last time, with ALL FOUR members of classic Floyd, including a heart-warming meeting of two old friends. (You have to watch the documentaries to find them all.) This was another high point.   Then another low point; At the Syd Barrett Tribute show, Roger Waters did a solo performance and the Waters-Less Floyd did a separate performance, putting doubt into the chance of any future reunion gigs, which has now turned from doubt into an ever-resounding NO with the passing of Wright.  Finally, after another rise of the return of Waters to the stage and the possibility of a new Waters album, as well as the announcement of this very product, things were good again.  Then we were given a hard and violent kick in the gut by fate as the ever private Wright, who had kept his illness out of the public eye passed away from cancer, which he kindly kept hidden from the fans.   The release of this set is possibly the last trip up on the roller coaster, as we get a chance to see Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Wright perform their magic along with Mr. Manzanera, Mr. DiStanislao, Mr. Carin, Mr. Pratt, Mr. Parry and an orchestra one last time, as well as have a souvenir to take with us and listen to in the car or wherever we enjoy listening to CDs. This set is a bittersweet farewell to a man, a band, and \\"softly spoken magic spell\\" that cannot be spoken ever again. Thanks to all of the band, and everyone responsible for this.   The quality of the CDs and the DVDs is excellent, and you can tell a lot of work went into this, as well as a lot of love. Yes, this is a quality product, and it is a way for us to enjoy the legacy of this great act, along with Remember That Night.   We'll remember both nights for a long time to come, and the Echoes will never fade. Now I just hope I can watch and listen to the mournful masterpiece once without breaking into a fit of tears....
0030554381|2.0|I absolutely HATED reading this book. I respect it as a very popular piece of literature, but in truth I spent more time sounding out all of the names in this then actually reading it!
6305428042|5.0|For my family no holiday is complete without a long list of holiday movies to watch and enjoy. This movie is absolutely on our list, and it has long been a favorite.<br />Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy deliver hilarious performances as the wicked and witchy Sanderson sisters; back after a long awaited rest they are ready to wreak havoc on the town of Salem and regain their youth. Funny, sweet and good for the entire family, it's one of Disney's best. (Despite some critcism from uptight people who have issue with the word \\"virgin\\".) I think there are far worse words being used on TV these days, but hey to each their own. I love this movie and so do my kids, for us Halloween is not complete without it!
1592402690|5.0|Few voices ring more true than someone who has been there and seen it first hand.  That is why Emerick's book is so important.  To hear the words of someone who helped record some of the greatest Beatles masterpieces...wow.  His style is autobiographical without skimping on details.  The writing is entertaining, honest, and carries authority.<br /><br />I was very excited to get my hands on this book.  So many volumes about the Beatles have been written about the Beatles by people who were far removed from the phenomenon.  Many more are just general histories that seem to repeat the same worn out chestnuts.  This book, though, is neither.<br /><br />Geoff Emerick was right there in the studio helping to record the music from the ground up.  He saw the group in its beginning stage, creative middle, and cantankerous end.  His love of the Beatles pours through without ever becoming sappy or  revisionist.  He tells stories that are both flattering and warty for the fab four...Emerick does not hold back.<br /><br />One interesting aspect to this book is that while 80% of it is about the Beatles themselves, the other 20% is about Emerick's life, his relation to EMI, George Martin, and Apple.  While this might seem like a detriment, at first (who buys a Beatles book to read about someone else's life?) in Emerick's case it strengthens what he has to say.  His aside story gives perspective on what it was like to work at the monolithic EMI studios, and how different it was to work at the carnival that was Apple Studios.  These pieces of information round out the story and present Emerick as a character worth of appreciation in his own right.<br /><br />Emerick describes some of the new techniques that were developed to get the kind of sound the Beatles were after, and some of the major obstacles that came from trying to do so in a studio as stuffy and antiquated as EMI.  This was still a world where everything wasn't digital...it was possible to actually rip things apart, monkey with the wiring, and get a new sound.  Emerick was a master of this.<br /><br />Reading this book gave me perspective on how many people were there to help the Beatles develop their musical vision.  It is easy to see \\"the boys\\" as the creative geniuses pouring talent in to EMI and to forget the support system that helped that to happen.  Emerick's book reminds the reader, through eye-witness accounts and expert descriptions, that the Beatles phenomenon was the coming together of more than just four young men...a total pool of talent all came together at the right place at the right time to work the magic.<br /><br />This book has great stories, details, and humor.  Emerick's voice is apparent and this book never reads like a manual.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to hear stories about the Beatles from someone who was actually there and shared in the creative creation of Beatles music.a new sound.

B000Z6RH32|4.0|BLACK RAIN 1ST    I remember going to see this film in the theater.      I think it holds up over the years.    Great to look at, well acted.      1 thing I have NEVER liked about it is the Andy Garcia death scene.  Just to look at, not realistic.  For film only.    And, what started this story.  IF Michael & Anthony were in this restaurant WHY DID THEY NOT STOP THE KILLINGS BEFORE THEY HAPPENED?  They were police & had guns.    Still can't figure out little scene at the beginning of the film.  WHY TAKE YOUR KID TO SCHOOL IN THE RAIN ON A MOTORCYCLE?  Can't the kid get sick?    Good extras on this special edition DVD.    BUT, WHY A PLAIN JANE SILVER DVD?  This film was great to look at with both the Japan & New York playing key roles in the film.      Film has the Ridley style.  1 of my favorites of his.    FATAL ATTRACTION    I remember when the film came out. Film goers were talking about it.    Of course, the memorable lines & scenes.    To me it has lost a bit of it's edge over the passage of 21 years.    Well acted by the 3 principles.    1 THING I HAVE ALWAYS HATED ABOUT IT & STILL BOTHERS ME TODAY. What was the deal with the kid Ellen's hair? I THOUGHT IT WAS A GIRL BUT WITH THAT BOYS HAIR CUT? A boy named Ellen?    Some good extras on the DVD. Having the laser disc of the film I had already scene the \\"original ending\\" to the film.    At the height of Michael's successful film streak in the 1980's. With the purchase of this DVD I now have the 3 roles of Glenn's I like, besides this 1 \\"Air Force One\\" & \\"101 Dalmatians\\".    `Don't ignore it\\" JUST IGNORE THE KID'S HAIR CUT.
0811836363|5.0|If there was one book about the Beatles that you should be stranded on a desert island with, it would be this one.  It is made up entirely of interviews, most of which are both new and not featured in the Anthology film.  All the great personalities within the Beatles shine through.<br /><br />Ok, I'm going on out a limb, here, assuming that you haven't already gotten this book.  It probably is a bit of stretch, seeing as everybody and his brother owns this mother, but I couldn't allow myself to continue living unless I included it here.  You MIGHT not own a copy of this, for one of the following very legitimate reasons:<br /><br />1. You live in some kind of cave that does not get delivery service,<br />2. You have chronic back pain and were afraid to pick up a book this heavy,<br />3. You were too busy pleasuring your super-model girlfriend,<br />4. You figured since you saw the Anthology video there was no need.<br /><br />Actually, only the first 3 reasons are any good.  The fourth one, as I will explain, is not.<br /><br />The Anthology book is not just a retelling of what you saw in the video.  It is a complimentary piece that explores in-depth those issues the video did not have time for.  Best of all, they didn't just hire some slob to re-tell the Beatles story.  Instead, they mined about a million hours of interviews and conducted a million hours more to create a book that is so densely packed with information they have to kill 23 squid to get the ink they need to print each glorious copy. *<br /><br />Frankly, this is the Beatles story as told by the Beatles themselves in their own Beatle words.  On top of that, being an official Apple product, this book layers endless glossy pictures across the pages.  Text and images merge and become something new.<br /><br />This book is huge, heavy, and awe-inspiring.  If you don't have it, and you care anything about the Beatles, drop what you are doing and get yourself a copy.<br /><br />*no squids were harmed during the writing of this review.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|what a great script!  I have waited so patiently for the dvd release.  Yes, I am a fan of the show and was so excited with another chance to share 2 hours of my life with these fabulous actors and their life in NY.<br /><br />So Big is back and does he continue to act out his 'lack of commitment\\" role with Carrie - this was subtly the best central part of the movie.  I dont want to be a spoiler.  The fans are lead through the twist and turn of the plot.  being a girlie, yes, I screamed at the movie in certain parts- disbelieve and then I cried when the friendship all pulled together.  And I loved the costumes.  Although I am not sure everyone actually dresses like that in NY and I live here.<br /><br />I loved every minutes of the film and wanted more. I hope they can pick up the series again ... with the new phases of their life.  I prefer these characters than lipstick jungle.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|I recently examined a set of these DVDs, purchased by a friend. The quality is fine, and the enhancements are worth the expense.<br /><br />However, take note: for some reason, despite the product explanation to the contrary, there are NO English sub-titles included. There are French and Spanish sub-titles, and there is English closed-captioning, but the more easily readable, and less intrusive sub-titles in English are missing.<br /><br />This also applies to set 2. It will be interesting to see if set 3 corrects this oversite.<br /><br />This is all the more puzzling and annoying, as the earlier, un-enhanced versions of these DVDs do, indeed, have sub-titles in English.
0440238153|2.0|Now I know Pullman had no idea what he was doing when he started this trilogy. This book runs on fumes, and it's made even worse when the author introduces ideas only to discard them lazily. Like the guy who goes after our main characters. Father Gomez, I think his name is. The book keeps returning to him like he's important to the story, but he winds up not being important at all.    And then there's Iorek Byrnison, the bear. He shows up for a while, then disappears. I mean, come on. And don't get me started on the ending. I just don't get the significance of the angels and the ghosts and the daemons and the witches and the mulefa. They're all here, but they don't gel in this mess of a book.    Oh, yeah, and I still didn't give a crap about the characters. It's hard to relate to them when they talk like old people. Show me a kid who talks like Lyra and Will and I'll show you a monkey who craps gold.
0553381687|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  I have since recommended it (and the series) to anyone with a bend for fantasy, fiction, political scheming, and/or adventure.  Buy it, read it, then spread it.  You will not be disappointed...unless of course adult themes and content offend you.

B000QXDED6|5.0|\\"300\\" Is One of The Greatest Films Ever Made     Frank Miller's interpretation of the tale of 300 lone Spartan warriors fending off hordes of Persian invaders is hands down one the best films ever made.  Though 300 takes some artistic license and contains historical inaccuracies, the purpose of good art is not to teach history but to convey important ideals and themes.  300 is unabashed in its representation of the highest ideals of man, of clear cut good and evil, of right and wrong, and of a heroic defense, to the death, of freedom, justice, and reason.  The movie invokes and justifies feelings of empowerment and a renews your idealism, giving you the moral and spiritual fuel for your struggles for the good life by witnessing one of the most spirited defenses of ideals humans have ever accomplished.    Should a sculptor capture the scar on a man's body or a painter a cold sore on a woman's mouth?  Are these encouragements of humility, professing that mankind is flawed?  Or are these dishonest concretizations of temporary flaws into a permanent representation of reality?  A beautiful Hellenistic sculpture glorifies all the highest ideals of man; honor, pride, intellect, integrity, and beauty.  The broken, disembodied, disheveled forms of modern art are anti-intellectualism, de-humanization, the destruction of ideals and values, brought into permanent physical form.      Art, according to Aristotle, is in it's best form a representation of man as he ought to be, not as he is.  Art, according to Ayn Rand, is the selective concretization of abstractions of the highest ideals of the artist.  When someone chooses to capture something, especially an idea or principle, in a permanent form of representation, they are left with the options of how they wish to capture it, and what language they wish to convey the idea in.  A modern artist might try to represent a complex idea in an abstract and objectively rational form but when the manifestation in physical form of an ideabecomes so disassociated from any rational means to interpret it, it is indifferent from useless Rorschach ink blot tests and is much more an indication of the irrational nature of the thought of the artists, the subjective psychological biases of the viewer (as the French paper Le Monde demonstrated in it's review of the film \\"Hostel\\" when it ranked it as the best American film of that year because they somehow interpreted it as a commentary on American Imperialism, instead of the violent pornographic sadism that it really was) and a thinly veiled abdication of any objective standard in art, than it is an idealized concretization of metaphysical value judgments.  Is a spattering of incoherent paint drops on a wall, like any Jackson Pollack painting to be considered \\"art\\"?  Is a novel of incoherent prose \\"art\\", Is a movie with no logical progression, consistency, or plot, like \\"Lost Highway\\" art?  Is a novel encompassing an entire day of nothing like James Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" art?  These things, lacking barely any objective distinction from randomness, or being glorifications of nothingness, are not art, even though they may hang on walls or have leather bindings, to consider these art, is to take any useful distinguishing character of art away from the word and idea.  Readers may disagree on what Aristotle and Ayn Rand considered Art to be, but any definition if held consistently which includes meaningless intellectual vomit indistinguishable from randomness, does indeed renders the concept of art without value.      The proper form of art in a philosophy based on reason, reality, and life as an ethical standard is one that encourages a life based on reason, which can be tangibly connected in a meaningful manner to the reality of the witness to the art, and which advocates and promulgates a ethical system which holds life as it's standard.  Such art must be objectively understandable, but the setting, context, historical accuracy, etc are completely irrelevant to theconveyance of the message.  Art is a selective recreation of elements which pertain in and understandable manner to the issues we deal with in reality, based, as Rand, suggested on the artist's metaphysical value judgments.  Art is not a literal recreation of reality (cold sores, bunions, societal flaws and all) but instead is a recreation of the critical elements of reality required for conceptual conveying a message or theme.      Consider then, what great art is, and understand that \\"300\\" is probably the greatest concretization of human ideals in visual media ever created.  \\"300\\" is not a historical documentary and contains technical inaccuracies from the way the Spartan's fought to the nature and makeup of Spartan society.  But if you want a documentary, turn to the History Channel.  This movie is absolutely NOT a historical documentary and to dislike it because it is not historically accurate is to assert that all art must be nothing more than accurate retelling of historical accounts.  Yet we do not belittle the great works of Shakespeare because they contain linguistic anachronisms or the great epics of Ancient Greece because they contained gods and monsters.  \\"300\\" is a moral epic told against a historical backdrop, containing real historical figures but representing them as profound human beings we can all look up to and admire, in situations and stories indeed conceptually similar to the factual historical reality.  Stories that serve to inspire and encourage us to weather difficult storms, persevere against obstacles blocking our goals, and continue to fight; not because we might win and not because it is our duty, but because it is being true to our own ideals in defense of our deepest values, that these are things ought to do because it is right.      In classical Greek fashion, Frank Miller was not presenting Sparta (and man) as he is or was, but as he *ought* to be; physically perfect, morally absolute, passionate and intelligent, emotive and rational.    When facing the Persian emissaries, King Leonidas does not call for negotiations and capitulations, he does not negotiate with his would be murderers, he kicks them into a well.  When debating what to do against the coming Persian onslaught, Leonides abandons the advice of the corrupt mystics and gathers a volunteer force to face the Persian hordes.  When faced with the corrupting offer of riches and rule over the entire Hellenistic empire, Leonides, facing certain death, declines, opting to fight in defense of his ideals instead of giving up what he values most to perpetuate his mere mechanical existence, a life which would then be of self torture as demonstrated when he condemns the Spartan Ephialtas who betrayed Leonidas and the 300 to the Persians to \\"a very long life\\".  Facing absolute certain death, Leonidas and his mean nevertheless stay on and fight, knowing that delaying the Persians at Thermopylae would allow time for the rest of the Spartan army to join with other Greek city states and ultimately repel the Persian invasion - a battle which some historians rank as the most important battle in all of history.      \\"300\\" also un-apologetically and flagrantly disregards the false dichotomy between reason and passion.  King Leonidas is no barbarian robot, but a passionate lover to his wife, and passionate fighter for justice.  He respects and cherishes his wife, who is as morally strong as he, and he fights and dies for her freedom, not wishing to see her condemned to a life of slavery, while she fights to save his life.      When ordered not to fight by the superstitious religious elders, Leonidas disregards their feelings and edicts and mounts a strategic defense of a critical area of Greece, ultimately saving every thing and everyone he values.   The coming of this movie reminds me of the context of Star Wars in the late 70's.  Where movies had disco sound tracks and nihilistic themes, coming out of the 70's Vietnam protest and moral relativism era, Star Wars came along to tell an inspirational and uplifting grand heroic moral epic with a classical and powerfully emotive sound track.  Today in our sea of moral relativism and 'flawed' heroes (consider the plethora of movies that actually glorify villains, like 'Natural Born Killers', mock heroes, like \\"True Lies\\" and \\"Die Hard\\", or celebrate violent death and torture, like \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\" ) \\"300\\" comes along to tell a powerful inspiring tale of moral absolutism and heroism.   I can not recall the last time I heard people cheer at a movie, and it wasn't just the style of the movie, it's the message as well, presented in a good style, that resonates strongly with people. I for one find myself filled with a little more hope for America since a movie like this did so well in the box office.  This movie appeals to our innermost capacity for idealism and invokes feelings of empowerment and justifies them.  It brings us moral and spiritual fuel for the struggles for a good life we undertake.      Because of all these virtues, \\"300\\" has caused quite the firestorms of criticism.  Most of them center around the historical inaccuracies in the film, focusing on petty details, such as the armor the Spartans wore and the methods they used to fight, while ignoring glaringly obvious historical inaccuracies, like Xerxes being 14' tall and having a henchman with bone saw arms, neither of which had any remotely possible intention of being interpreted as a historical accuracy.  These critics ignore these things and focus on petty details in an attempt to undermine the moral tale of the story.  Yet nobody cries that Homer's \\"Iliad\\" is a historical falsehood, because it is not meant to be a documentary, it is meant to represent the highest ideals of ancient Greek civilization.  Nobody attacks Shakespeare for his inaccuracies in Julius Ceaser, nobody derides \\"Beowulf\\" because Grendel was not real.  Nobody attempts to argue that Dante's \\"The Inferno\\" is worthless because the hero travels into the fictional Hades.  The great works of literature last not because they are historically accurate, they rarely if ever are, but usually because they convey great human moral truths in a powerful story and in a manner which people can objectively connect with.  Likewise \\"300\\" is not a documentary, so critics attacking it's historical inaccuracies (especially in a time where historical accuracies are difficult to ascertain anyway)  are simply trying to make a name for themselves by attacking something better than they are ever capable of.    Many other criticism lay around attacks on the Spartan way of life in general.  Critics will say that the real Spartans were mystical and collectivist.  They might ask, why not play this movie in Nazi Germany and see all the Storm Troopers yell in delight with the same reaction and inspired Americans do?  (Obfuscating of course the ideals which invoke the reaction with the physical reactions themselves, as if rallying in the name of freedom is the same things as rallying in the name of murderous tyranny merely because in both cases one is 'rallying')   Sparta, they will say, had slavery, was a heavily collectivist society, treated it's women poorly, etc.  In all these cases they completely ignore the context surrounding Sparta and the context of the Ancient world.   It was a world where EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING WHO EXISTED was a slave, and where most societies did not even have a WORD for Freedom.  Only the world of Ancient Greece even had a word for freedom (eluethera) to differentiate a kind of existence from slavery, and had portions of their populations, large or small, identified as free men.  Every Ancient Civilization had slavery, ONLY ANCIENT GREECE had freedom, and yes even Sparta had free men.  Only Ancient Greece had the idea of Freedom and the ability for men to achieve it.      They might argue that one could represent the heroic soldiers of Nazi Germany in the same manner.  But heroism in the name of murderous ideals is merely savage brutality, Nazism advocated forced nationalist servitude in a time where half the world had decent (though flawed) systems which were based on freedom, where every culture had the concept and words for Freedom, and Nazi Germany actively crushed this.  The context of Nazi Germany was totalitarianism rising in a sea of Freedom and Liberal Democracy.  Nazism was a step backward in a world of freedom, Spartan and Greek civilizations were a step forward in a world of totalitarian enslavement.  This film emphasized the only bastion of freedom in an entire world of slavery, indeed, they were the first steps forward toward Freedom in a march which still continues to this day.  If you were to make a movie glorifying extreme nationalism and dictatorial rule, Nazi Germany is an optimal setting because it contrasts the concept of freedom embraced by much of the world, if you are making a movie defending and glorifying freedom and reason, Ancient Greece is an excellent setting as it contrasts the prevalence of slavery and tyranny which dominated every other ancient civilization.      The very concept of \\"freedom\\" had to originate somewhere for it to develop into it's modern form.  Yes Sparta also had slaves, no not all Spartans were free.  But let us not forget that women in the US did not get the right to vote until the 20's and black men until after the civil war. Give the ancient Hellenes a break as the rest of the world would not even match their limited gains toward freedom for nearly 2,000 years. Would we chide a movie about the bravery of Union soldiers in the American Civil War by saying \\"well women couldn't vote\\"?  No, every salient step toward freedom should be celebrated, and the Ancient Greek city states steps took the first and most important steps in that direction, and at the battle of Thermopylae and in the greater context of the Persian wars, would come face to face with the greatest threat that ideal would ever encounter in a victory whose repercussions resonate throughout the world for thousands of years.     My only major complaint with 300 was that the Spartan 300 did not in fact stay and fight out of duty, as was depicted in the film, but in fact stayed and fought, even knowing it would bring their deaths, to give their land the vital time necessary to collect an army to defend the city states of Greece.  Though this is a historical inaccuracy, I cite it because the accurate story was thematically much more powerful.  Leonidas appealed to the Spartan honor code of never surrendering in the movie, yet it was in fact this very event which founded the Spartan tradition of never surrendering.      Also, as Leonidas left his wife for the final time, the narration insisted that the Spartan code did not allow the expression of love or regret at this moment, as it would have been a sign of 'weakness'.  This, to me, deviated from the intense passion and love of values that Leonidas showed at all other times with his wife and the Spartans embraced.  A minor complaint, but it was out of place with the character the Miller had established with Leonidas.      Additionally, Frank Miller appears to feel that true heroism is sacrificing ones life in the name of a higher ideal.  Sacrificing ones own life for a higher ideal, for something that is more important to someone than their life, is noble and just, but only when it is the last and necessary course of action.  Fighting for ones highest ideals, perpetually and indefinitely through the whole course of one's life, is far more difficult and far more admirable.  Dying in the name of a cause, many people think, is the highest and most noble sacrifice, but in reality it is a fleeting moment and temporary decision made permanent, Living for a cause and fighting perpetually for it is far more noble, far more difficult, and far more rational.    This film is not about the Greeks versus the Persians, nor is it a historical docudrama, these are only the setting where a theme is played out.  Good stories transcend the backdrop they are performed on and speak to people of all eras because they speak to an important ideal.  The theme of this movie, the message it was conveying, the ideals it's characters were embracing and fighting for, was not in defense of mysticism and slavery, but was in defense of individuals fighting to their last breath for their highest ideals, but not just any ideals, specifically the ideals of reason and freedom.  The theme is of these brave men (brave because courage in the name of evil ideals is not courage, but savagery) fighting against the brutal enslavement of them and the people they care for at the hands of a murderous tyrant.      Like great historical fictional figures of Antigone and Hector, like the true to life historical figures of Cicero and Cato, and Raul Wallenberg of the modern era, and countless others who refused to capitulate and turn in their loved ones or loved way of life and died because of it at the hands of murderous thugs, the theme is of these valiant people standing up for and defending what they know is right and just in the face of the most brutal forms of oppression and savagery.  It is a theme not only of moral courage but also of perseverance and overwhelming tenacity, of struggling through the most tremendous odds for what you know to be right, even if you face death along the way.      For the purpose of life is not to perpetuate the mere mechanical structure of our existence, it is to perpetuate not just life but a particular kind of life, an Aristotealan Eudaimonic life, a life of productive and intellectual growth, a life of goals and challenges, a vibrant life of learning and experiencing new ideas, new cultures, a life where your highest values, the health and well being of yourself and your loved ones and the growth you pursue, are passionately identified and defended at all costs, and are never surrendered and never abandoned.  Where your passion and your goals drive your life and your friends and lovers are fellow travelers in your journey.    When you struggle at pursuing your goals and values, think of Leonidas and the brave 300, fighting for days on end through piles of bodies, the Persian hordes in front of them and their wives and children in the cities behind them.  Know you have it in you to push yourself that much harder in pursuit of your goals and ideals.  But be sure your goals are sound and ideals are good, fancy clothes and big houses do not necessarily make a good life, and pursuit of the irrational may actually damage the things you do value.  When you are exhausted and battered, think of the 300 Spartans facing millions of Persians, fighting for freedom and justice and reason, think of their courage and tenacity and find strength in yourself that they as fellow humans found and that you know you have in you.  Always fight for your ideals and the things you value in homage to Leonidas and the 300 and your own highest potential.  This is one of the greatest movies ever made, see it, enjoy it, feel it, love it.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie starts out as any normal movie, but become quite monotonous throughout most of the movie, (which I'm sure was the director's intent) then has an awesome ending.  \\"Well worth the wait\\"  Be patient.
031606792X|3.0|I started off the twilight saga by reading the first 3 in under a week flat, its safe to say meyer had me hooked..When it was finally time for the 4th needless to say i was extremely excited, and then i read it..    I didnt have any immediate problems with the book until it reached time for the honeymoon, then i started to think about something i had seen when i bought the book, the target age group is for 7th-12th graders..once i remembered that this book is YOUNG adult i immediatly became uncomfortable with the fact that the author would make the protagonist so hungry for sex, especially when knowing how young her audience is.     I didnt become wierded out with the book until it revealed Bellas pregnancy, if you can even call it that..which was extremely disturbing and once again not age appropriate.    I honestly believe that there is NO way that a twilight movie would be coming out in novemeber if BD had been published alongside the other 3....there is no way to make this book into a movie that would be appropriate for young teens but how can you make the first 3 into a movie and leave out the 4th? I would bet that after reading the 4th book there are some movie executives out there who are kicking themselves for greenlighting twilight, yes it will be an amazing movie that we will all love, but i literally cringe at the idea of the 4th being made into a movie, do you really think there going to show nessie breaking every bone in bellas body during birth??    All in all i woke up the next morning thinking, what was going threw her mind when she wrote this book?
0786888628|5.0|David Halberstam's last book is a true classic detail of the start of the Korean War through its first cruel and brutal Winter.<br /> One thing Halberstam always does is that he gets the view of history from the men who were on the ground when it happened.  He just doesn't get the enlisted man's viewpoint, he also gets the perspectives of the junior officers and junior staff who saw first hand the decisions of senior officers, and how they effected the troops on the ground.<br /> In reading some of the reviews of this book, I saw critical remarks about this book not being what it was claimed to be.  For some strange reason these reviewers were looking for the ultimate read on the entire Korean War.  If that's what you are looking for this is not your book.<br /> However if you want to learn about the origins of this War and how the United States reacted to these preemptive attacks then this is indeed the book you want to read.<br /> This is the definitive Cold War showdown.  The High Noon of the Cold War.  Russia nudges Red China to back this attack.  North Korea attacks South Korea.  The United States in all its unpreparedness enters the conflict.  The fight of the Pusan Perimeter and the exploits of Task Force Smith are all fully described in a flowing and gripping narrative by Halberstam.<br /> Enter Douglas MacArthur and in his last magnificent grand strategy is able to pull off a successful landing at Inchon to cut off the North Korean supply lines and send the enemy reeling to the North.<br /> Halberstam  guides us in MacArthur's march to the North.  He shows the lack of MacArthur's intelligence and also the committing of the mortal sin of separating 8th Army and X Corps.  The Author depicts a rather inept Douglas MacAuthur who subjects American Troops in harms way needlessly.  Indeed he never suspected that 300,000 Red Chinese Troops were waiting at the Yalu River.<br /> What happened at Kanuri and the Chosin Reservoir should not have happened at all.  When President Truman fired MacArthur the whole nation was enraged.  In fact from that time forward Truman's approval rating tumbled.  From early 1951 on, Truman knew he couldn't run for President again, even though he was eligible to campaign.  The sad fact of it all is that in retrospect Truman was right and MacArthur was wrong.  Dead wrong!<br /> Halberstam does a great job in showing us what General Matt Ridgeway had to contend with and sort out when he took command of the UN Troops.  We see a soldier's General who would relieve his own brother of command if that person couldn't do the job.<br /> This is a classic look into the origins and first months of this forgotten conflict.  Put this down as a must read!acArthur the whole nation was enraged.  In fact from that time forward Truman's approval rating tumbled.

0596101996|4.0|This book is downright comprehensive and thoroughly deserves its \\"definitive guide\\" title.    But, the example scripts the author gives are long and deadly boring, which is why I won't give it five stars.    To \\"get\\" JavaScript, you need shorter scripts which are easier to learn from.    My recommendation is to use this book in conjunction with the w3schools website.
0385340990|5.0|What a WONDERFUL novel.  It's completely in epistolary form, starting when a gentleman in Guernsey (an island between England and France) buys a second hand book with the previous owners name and address in it.  Loving the topic of the book, and given the fact that he lives in a small, isolated place and it's right after WWII, he writes to her in hopes that she can help him find more books by the same person.  It's an unlikely start to what will prove to be an life altering chain of events for many, many people.  Dawsey wrote to Juliette, who happens to be a writer in search of a new project.  Through some back and forth, she begins to learn more about Dawsey and Guernsey and what it was like for the five years that the island was occupied by the Germans.  What really cinches it for her, however, is the discovery that of how The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, which started out as a lie to save<br />lives when a group of folks got caught out after curfew, ended up giving hope, meaning and friendship to an extremely diverse group of folks.  I simply cannot tell you how extremely charming and absorbing this book is and how well these authors develop multiple characters with real depth and strong voices.  It's well researched and lovingly told.  There's a lot to it--I think this would make an excellent bookclub pick.

031606792X|1.0|BORING. It was predictable, comparatively slow paced and shmaltzy. Why didn't Meyer trust us with a tragedy? Something that would ground this book a bit more. Less Mormon white-picket fence, live-for-eternity-making-babies, no-one's-sad crap?    Very disappointing.    She got two stars because she had credit left over from the first two books. Her plot genius and setting was wonderful. The characters could be a little more interesting, like have a life beyond each other (so at the Pearly Gates will Meyer be asked about her responsibility in producing a generation of co-dependent relationships?) or even one, just one, independent, intelligent thought, but it was a ride and a good one and the entertainment value high.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|I really don't know why a lot of the supposed professional movie reviewers gave this movie such a bad grade if your a fan of the games or not it still was a great horrific movie.  To those who have played Silent Hill 1 through 3 we all know the basics of the storyline and of course with Hollywood producers there are going to be some changes in the movie that differ from the game.  This movie storyline does seem to follow-up with the first except instead of the father you have the mother coming to Silent Hill to try and help her adopted daughter remember her past that she has about Silent Hill.  Again if your a fan and played the game I'm sure we all remembered the Pyramid Head guy from the game he to will also be in the movie as well as a few other recognizable creatures from Silent Hill.  The actors they got to play in the movie were great no complaints for any of them and the special effects were spectacular too.  There is a great deal of difference in the picture detail and audio between the standard dvd an the blu-ray dvd<br />but I feel it was mostly the audio a lot of background noises and other things you didn't hear before with the standard dvd you hear excellently with the blu-ray dvd.  So if your looking for a good horror movie or a good supernatural movie this one would be a good dvd for your library..
B001DHE9KG|5.0|I believe I own a copy of every commercial CD recording of \\"La Boheme,\\" as well as several DVDs of live performances and this DVD is BY FAR my favorite.  I even saw the Zeffirelli production at the Met live with Gheorghiu and Alagna the afternoon after they got married, but even that did not move me as this did.  A performance that, after all this time and exposure to the opera, can leave me in tears is a rarity, and I was sobbing at the end of this video.    Every one of the six principals is magnificent, singing and acting gloriously.  At first, I was concerned that the extremely expansive tempi Maestro Luisotti employs would enervate the production.  But, while the tempo for \\"Mi chiamano Mimi,\\" combined with the close-ups in HD of Angela Gheorghiu performing in the gigantic Metropolitan Opera House, does elicit some silent movie actress-like facial expressions and gestures from her, on the whole, these tempi allow each of the singers to bring a greater variety of coloration to their tones than one usually hears, which in turn only enhances the dramatic impact.  For example, I usually find \\"O Mimi tu piu non torni\\" to be a pretty, but somewhat annoying, diversion before the drama of the final act commences.  BUt under Maestro Luisotti and with the beautiful and sensitive singing of Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier, it becomes one of the most moving moments of the opera.  In fact, I was in tears throughout the final act.  Every characters emotions were heartfelt and never schmaltzy or overheated.    Also with respect to coloration, Ms. Gheorghiu produced some of the darkest tones I have ever heard in \\"Donde lieta usci.\\"  While others have made this a pretty and nostalgic aria, Ms. Gheorghiu with subtlety rips out your heart just as Mimi's has been torn from her.    As I said, I saw this production with Ms. Gheorghiu and her brand new husband in the lead roles, but I didn't feel the love between Mimi and Rodolfo as I felt it between her and Mr Vargas.  His performance matched hers in its unique combination of subtlety and intensity.  And to top it all off, they both sang with some of the most beautiful lines and tones ever brought to this music.    For newcomers and aficionados alike, this DVD is an ESSENTIAL component of any opera lovers collection.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|I don't care if TITANIC won the 1997 Oscar for Best Picture.<br /><br />For my money, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL Is the best film to come out of Hollywood in the last twenty years.<br /><br />This is prime film noir.  In future history books of the cinema, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL will be ranked right up there with the great ones, such as DOUBLE INDEMNITY, OUT OF THE PAST and THE BIG SLEEP.  And, as much as I admire and consistently enjoy those classic movies, I think that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is the finest of the lot.<br /><br />Adapting James Ellroy's intricately-plotted, sometimes confusing, novel was certainly a monumental task for writer/director Curtis Hanson and his screenwriting collaborator, Brian Helgeland.  Not only did they have to bring to life  more than a half-dozen key characters, but there were also several intertwined  plot lines to juggle.<br /><br />Hanson and Helgeland have done an admirable job.  Their characters are real and, although the story is complicated, by the end credits, everything is explained.  There are no loose ends.  Truly, the movie is better than the book.<br /><br />Set in a superbly re-created 1950's Los Angeles, the film's primary storyline concerns the real reasons behind a mass murder in the Night Owl Cafe.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, three police detectives of widely different backgrounds and agendas, ultimately join together to battle police corruption, the Mob and, at times, each other.  Along the way, they interact with some fascinating folk, including a hooker who looks like Veronica Lake (Oscar winner Kim Basinger), her rich pimp (David Strathairn) and the editor of a nasty scandal magazine (Danny DeVito).<br /><br />James Cromwell also co-stars as a police captain who is willing to break the rules.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000084T18|3.0|I think this album is far overrated and certainly not the classic it's billed as. Also this isn't even 50 Cents best album. For anyone who's heard it, his best album is 'Power Of The Dollar'. He has never been a great lyrically but on POTD he sounds much hungrier and rawer than this album. Go listen, it's worth it.    Get Rich Or Die Tryin' has some good tracks though including: What up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting (Eminem really outshines 50 on this one), Many Men, Heat, Blood Hound, Back Down and Wanksta. All these tracks are worth listening to.    Notice I havn't said any of the singles, that's because they are boring and have been overplayed. In da club was catchy when it came out but tired now, P.I.M.P has a weak beat, 21 Questions also has a weak beat and is a track for the ladies and If I Cant is average at best.    Go and get 50's Power Of The Dollar album or you tube some of the songs off it, with great tracks like How To Rob...., Life's On The Line (which is one of the bonus songs on Get rich or die tryin'), Da Repacussions and Material Girl 2000.
B001DHE9KG|4.0|For my money, the star of this performance is Ramon Vargas. He can act with the kind of restraint Hamlet rightly recommends for all times to any players, and he is in glorious voice throughout. Angela Gheorghiu possesses an indisputably gorgeous voice, and her employment of middle and high registers here is beyond criticism. She seems, though, to have developed a mannerism, a gummy holding on to vowels in the final syllables of low notes at the end of phrases which are unnecessarily ugly rather than dramatic. Also, she tends to annoyingly overact. Her Mimi has more characterization than most, it's true, and her aggressiveness in going after her chubby Rodolfo, rather than portraying the usual passive-aggressive consumptive heroine is not the problem. What is problematic is her combining of disparates. At her entrance, she's already half dead. After a sip of wine, she's Sieglinde stumbled into Paris.  The conception, along with the silent-movie emoting, is sadly contradictory. She deserved a better stage director.    The conducting of this performance seems to my ears excessively slow, with the consequence that famous moments lack any memorableness. Like a bandmaster, the conductor bows to his singers rather than to Puccini's genius.    The rest of the cast is adequate, but hardly representative of the Met casting from strength. All in all, a good performance, but hardly a great or memorable one.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I absolutely love Demi Lovato's voice, and once I knew she was releasing a debut album, I knew it would be awesome!    Her new album, Don't Forget, features the hit single \\"Get Back,\\" and plus other cool songs like \\"La La Land,\\" \\"Trainwreck,\\" and \\"One the Line\\" with Jonas Brothers.    I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. She has a great voice, and she makes great music. Period.
B000001FS6|4.0|After having read a lot of the mid to negative reviews of Rattle & Hum I must confess that many of them are right about several things.    Could be nice if U2 gave it a makeover in a future extended cd version. They could for instance put the live tracks on one CD and add some more of those from the movie and make 1 CD of the studiomaterial+some of the b-sides from that period. I have played a litle with the tracklisting and a studio album of Rattle & Hum could look like this:    Desire  Angel of Harlem  Hallelujah (Here she comes) (B-side)  Hawkmoon 269  Van Diemen's Land (Complete version without the early fade please!!)  Silver and Gold (studio version b-side Joshua tree period)  Love come rescue me    When loves come to town  Heartland  Dancing Barefoot (B-side)  God part II  A room at the heartbreak hotel (B-side)  All I want is you  Unchained Melody (b-side)    This order makes for a dark americana album and is quite a ride and perhaps gives a little more of an underplayed version of the whole \\"discovering america in a flagwaving position\\", instead giving the album more of a coherent flow and the point still comes across but in a more subtle way that I personally think gives it a whole new life.    The live version of the disc? Haven't got a clue to that since I'm not to keen on that side of U2... at least not in this period...   [[ASIN:B000001FS6 Rattle and Hum]]

B00192KCQ0|3.0|Seems like the majority of Metallica fans feel St. Anger to be crap and Death Magnetic awesome. Hmm...    I've been into Metallica since 1982. I got No Life 'til Leather demo tape then. Yeah, I'm an old fart. Both the demo and following three albums (Kill 'em All, Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets) brought something new in Heavy Metal, each one in its' own special way.    ...And Justice For All was good, but nothing new anymore. Black Album was decent mainstream Metal effort. And like we all know, the band went downhill after that. Until St. Anger came. It blew me away, again, like the demo and the 3 first LP's.    What was found in St. Anger was a band expanding its' limits and rediscovering what is crucial in Metal music: energy and feeling. And those made Metallica back in the 80's what it is now, a classic Heavy Metal band. So, St. Anger a classic? Yes!    Death Magnetic has very conventional approch in music. Like had ...And Justice For All, Black Album, Load, Reload, S&M and Garage Inc. What rises Death Magnetic to same \\"good solid seven\\" level with ...And Justice For All and Black Album, are OK but mostly average compositions - compared to 3 first albums - and energetic musicianship.    Still, a good - although overlong - album and I have played it a lot. Leave out \\"The Unforgiven III\\" and \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" and you get 57 minutes of great thrash 'n bang Metal. I would have given 4 stars if they would have left those 2 out themselves.    And by the way, if you want it without ultimately annoying digital distortion, get Japanese SHM-CD version.
B0000027I6|5.0|While some of you call this \\"Waters best solo effort\\" I'll go one step further.  I rate Amused to Death as the Best Album of the entire 90's.  This period was not the high point in recorded music but still produced some great work, including some by Pink Floyd [The Division Bell and Pulse].  Good as these albums are they can't top the creative genius in this album.  Themed? Yes........ Anti War?  Of course [The Bravery of Being Out of Range being perhaps the best antiwar song ever recorded].  Musically great?  Yes, with a combination of great writing, studio magic and Jeff Beck's incredible guitar work [What God Wants part 2 may possess some of the nastiest guitar licks ever laid down]. The title cut provides provocative insight into how we lived and, far into the future, what Alien Anthropologists see as evidence of our existence and demise \\"This species has amused itself to death\\".<br />Not a good work, a great work that should be part of every Floyd/Waters/Gilmour/classic rock/history-making music lovers collection.<br />5 HUGE STARS..........

B0000C23DO|5.0|The Grateful Dead began their \\"long, strange trip\\" in San Francisco in 1965 (originally as \\"The Warlocks\\"). Of course, they later became a legendary jam band that filled concert stadiums and sold millions of albums. Their sound was a laid back and psychedelic mix of rock, folk, country, jazz, gospel and bluegrass that included extra long improvisational instrumental jams.<br /><br />Although reluctantly, singer and lead guitarist Jerry Garcia was seen as the face of the band by many fans. The group disbanded after Garcia's death at 52 from a heart attack in 1995. Other original members Bob Weir (guitar), Phil Lesh (bass), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums) also consistently stayed with the Dead for the duration.<br /><br />The Dead's dedicated fans are known as \\"Dead Heads\\", and some have even followed the band from city to city as they toured, attending every concert. The band also allowed fans to record their shows providing there were no profits made from the recordings.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000C23DO The Very Best of the Grateful Dead]] (2003) includes seventeen songs that have been digitally remastered (to perfection), but are in no particular order. The song selection is on the mark, but keep in mind that this is the radio-friendly side of the band, and there is only one live selection, One More Saturday Night from [[ASIN:B00007LTIN Europe 72]]. Now, I'm no Dead Head (even though I did see them live once), and this collection really works for me. Nobody asked me before this was released, but if they had, I would've suggested that they add a second disc with all live material. Oh, well.<br /><br />There are five songs here from the album [[ASIN:B00007LTIL American Beauty]], and two each from [[ASIN:B00007LTIK Workingman's Dead]], [[ASIN:B000002VJH Blues for Allah]], and [[ASIN:B000EOTFEY In the Dark]]. The Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion) from the band's 1967 self-titled debut is the oldest song on the album, and Touch Of Grey, their Top Ten single from 1987, is the newest. The liner notes include an essay on The Grateful Dead's history, and information on each song including songwriter, album, release date, and producer. There are also some cool photographs of the band. The skeleton and roses on gold album cover is perfect.<br /><br />For the casual Dead fan this is the way to go. It beats [[ASIN:B000002KF8 Skeletons From The Closet: The Best Of The Grateful Dead]] by a long shot, and the sound quality here is perfect. I knocked off a half star because the songs aren't in chronological order. That doesn't ruin this for me, but I do prefer that feature in Best Of collections. Anyway, [[ASIN:B0000C23DO The Very Best of the Grateful Dead]] is still recommended, and very enjoyable. The Dead made some great music.<br /><br />When I first listened to this, I was surprised at how much The Grateful Dead's music had been a part of the musical landscape in my life over the years. These songs triggered memories of people and places I haven't thought of in years. Truckin', Casey Jones, Sugar Magnolia, U.S. Blues, Uncle John's Band, A Friend Of The Devil, Touch Of Grey. Oh, the memories!<br /><br />What a long, strange trip it's been...e an essay on The Grateful Dead's history, and information on each song including songwriter, album, release date, and producer.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|Fabulous!<br />That's the only word I can think of to describe both the movie and this CD. I've seen the movie now 5 times and went to see it again today but it's left the theater. The usher there recognized me and sadly gave me the terrible news: \\"I know,\\" she said. \\"You and all the others who came in today to see it again must be heart-broken.\\" There's only one very minor question: why was there no \\"I do! I do!\\" and \\"Chiquitita\\" and \\"Waterloo\\" on the CD? Pierce Brosnan was fabulous, especially that very touching ballad he crooned at the end, \\"When All is Said and Done.\\" Colin Firth was also terrific with his poignant ballad, \\"Our Last Summer.\\" Christine Baranski stopped the movie cold with her fantastic, bawdy, witty number, \\"Does your Number Know.\\" She told an interviewer that it took four days to film her number but: \\"Who cares? I had all those hunky, gorgeous young boys to dance with.\\" These songs have a habit of entering your memory and refuse to leave. But I can live with that.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica has resurrected their souls and careers from the dark,fiery pits of hell. I was very skeptical with this album at first, but when I heard I was very pleased that they have came back with roaring fury reminiscent of their first 5 albums. In my opinion as far as quality is concerned I rank it in between And Justice For All and the Black Album. I am glad that Metallica has finally listened to their fans, and has put something out worthy of our praise and worship, since they are our Heavy Metal Gods. So I bow down to Metallica and give them 5 stars for the comeback album of the century.
014241011X|5.0|This story has three parts: the first - scary and gruesome, the second - funny, full of adventure and predictable, the third - warm, unexpected and full of promise and excitement.    What stays with me is the love between the grandson and the grandmother - they fully accept one another despite their differences and they enthusiastically enjoy life and each other.    The ending is left open for the imagination - not taken to a close like so much these days where nothing is left to ponder upon.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|My daughter had this CD first and she recommended it to me.  Good music.
B0010X745K|5.0|I read The Mist in [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew]] as a kid and immediately wanted more of the story.  For years people have wished King's short story was longer and a maybe even redone as a full length novel.  We also wanted to see it on the big screen but alas we had to wait quite some time.  With King stories turned into movies you never know if it is going to be great (as with [[ASIN:0792846443 Misery]], [[ASIN:B0002J4ZWS The Shawshank Redemption (also based on a short story)]] and others. Or just plain disappointing compared to the novel (such as the butchering of one of King's best novels with movie version [[ASIN:B00006FDCD It]]. So maybe in hindsight its not a bad thing we had to wait so long and some B grade director didn't make a cheap movie of this classic short story.<br /><br />The major feel of the short story was still here, obviously being a short story other scenes (and an ending) had to be added to make a feature length film so you knew that going in.  I think the additional scenes pay great respect to the King story.  If you watch the extras on the DVD particularly A Conversation With Stephen King and Frank Darabont you'll learn King loved the film, especially the controversial ending (and I'm not spoiling that for those who haven't seen it like so many reviewers seem to enjoy doing).  I thought the ending was well done and excellent way to wrap up the film.  You'll also learn Frank Darabont thought Stephen's name was Stefan when he came across his first King novel experience - The Shining.<br /><br />Other special features you get with this DVD package are an audio commentary with Frank Darabont (director).  The Making of the Mist documentary titled When Darkness Comes which is quite interesting.  Plus a few theatrical trailers.<br /><br />The movie alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Definitely one of Kings best ever stories brought to film.  Well done to all those involved.<br /><br />Basic plot if you've got no idea what the movie or short story were about is after a vicious storm residents of a small town converge on the local supermarket to get supplies and prepare for the next one which is also coming with a thick mist.  As they queue at the checkouts a terrified local man runs into the supermarket telling them to shut the doors and that another local was killed by something in the mist.  Many doubt there is anything to fear but it soon becomes evident there are things in the mist that make going outside suicide.  Inside the supermarket power struggles and paranoia mean that maybe the town folk have more to fear from each other, than what's outside!icious storm residents of a small town converge on the local supermarket to get supplies and prepare for the next one which is also coming with a thick mist.

0375826726|2.0|I enjoyed the first book and felt the second was well done, but this one should not be a standalone. This book felt like filler. The whole thing could have been condensed down to about 100 pages. The prose tends to ramble on about the battle scenes, the forging of a sword, and confusion felt by the main characters (Eragon, Saphira). Not to mention the confusion of several major (Arya, Roran)and minor (Nasuda, Katrina)characters who are treated as major characters.     The information in this book should have been included in appedices in the final book of the trilogy rather than as a bridge between the first two books and the fourth book.

B000R8YC1S|5.0|I purchased Labyrinth when it first came out, as a video tape. I have always been a David Bowie fan, and wanted to see him in this role. I still consider it to be a timeless classic. I already owned the music from the movie, which is wonderful, as well as the DVD. I wanted this anniversary edition because it contained more interviews about the movie.<br /><br />David Bowie shines as the not so evil Goblin King Jareth. He is an unhappy guy, who has fallen in love with a human teenager, Sarah, who is played by Jennifer Connelly. When his goblin co-horts steal Toby, Sarah's baby brother, Jareth is forced to confront Sarah, and offers to give her back her brother, if she completes his labyrinth within 13 hours.<br /><br />Sarah agrees to the challenge, and enters the world of the Labyrinth, an enchanted place where nothing is quite what it seems. There is adolescent/adult humor, but even children love the characters.<br /><br />Sarah meets Jareth at a time in her life when she is not yet a woman, but not a child. Her world stinks, and she is often left alone by her Father and Stepmother to baby-sit her baby brother. She is troubled, and Jareth senses that and uses it to try to coax Sarah to stay with him. He even offers to give her all of her dreams if only she will let him rule her. She is a good role model for teenage girls.<br /><br />My favorite scene in the movie is a dream segment, in which Sarah and Jareth attend a ball. It is beautifully done, and expresses what every young woman dreams about...a handsome King who sweeps you away to his castle, and falls in love with you.<br /><br />The film is filled with David Bowie's songs, which are great. My young grandson likes to dance along with the baby in the movie to the song \\"magic dance.\\" This movie might be a little bit intense for some children under the age of 8. My daughters loved this movie from the time they were about 10 years old. I still watch this about once a week, and even have it loaded on my ipod!<br /><br />If you want a move to watch that you can share with your kids and still enjoy, this may be the one for you! Add the interviews and behind the scenes video, and it is well worth owning!share with your kids and still enjoy, this may be the one for you!

B0017I1FP8|5.0|Hans Zimmer keeps on putting out good scores. This soundtrack is no exception. Each track has that \\"Dark Knight\\" felling you got when you saw the movie. It has my vote for best soundtrack of the year.
B0015XHP3Q|4.0|I like the Rambo series of movies. Let's face it, in all of the movies the Rambo character is preposterous at best. If the fantasy fighter thing doesn't turn you away, then go with it. I think Sylvester got a bad rap along the way and did not get all of his due as an actor and his ability to entertain. Hokey yes, but still a good movie.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I have never bothered to listen to this Hybrid SACD in stereo.  On my first listening I was blown away with surround sound where there are many instances where the the 3D sonic events take this album to a newer high. The most notable for me is \\"On the Run\\" where the footsteps criss cross not just from side to side but from back to front, and where a plane or something crashes it travels from rear left to front right. There are numerous instances throughout the album where surround sound has added a dimension which I am sure Messrs Waters, Gilmore and Wright would have wished was available when they orinally recorded this title.  The second thing I noticed was the sound was much clearer and there were things I had never heard on my cd version. I has been along time since I have owned a turntable, and when I did I didn't have a high end sound system.  On a couple of occasions when I have had friends over for dinner I have put it on and all have remarked at how they are blown away by this version of Dark Side of the Moon  I would say if you have an SACD compatible DVD player and 5.1 channel amplifier with 6 analog channel inputs this album is must have, particularly if you are a fan on Dark Side of the Moon.
0143038419|4.0|I hated to finish this book.<br /><br />I think the reason this book is so intensely popular is because even though most of Elizabeth Gilbert's readers can't identify with the logistics of her journey (she took a year off and traveled the globe because she was depressed!), but because they enjoyed her attitude about being open to change. She's serious, yet hilarious, open, yet emotionally crippled -- all at the same time.<br /><br />At times, the book felt like a travel journal. It was very interesting to me to learn so much about way different cultures live. Whether the national focus is on good food (Italians and their pasta and wine), a good relationship with their 'God' (Indians and their meditation) or, well, the people she interacted with in Indonesia are just too odd to categorize. The author was able to melt into each culture and share her experiences through good, old-fashioned American girl talk. All while searching for some kind of comfort within her own skin. She simply wanted to be happier and put herself through some pretty far out methods in order to come out on the other side of her unhappiness.<br /><br />As for the religious connotations (particularly while in India), I hope readers who aren't particularly 'believers' can plow through those references and enjoy her process. What she experiences is quite funny and, at times, pretty insightful.  She started the book with a general belief in 'our' God, so was willing to see how other cultures find greater comfort through their spiritual relationships with 'theirs'. However, for me, this wasn't religious reading (again, particularly the section about India because that's where her entire visit was about finding a spirituality that works for her). It was so far out from any kind of bible thumping that most of us normally avoid that it was a good read - if that makes sense? When she moves on to Indonesia, the beliefs that the people had were downright hilarious.<br /><br />If you find your head reeling because you just can't 'buy' the meditation stuff, fast forward through a paragraph or two, but don't give up. You might miss a few nuggets where she comes up with some pretty wonderful insights about life, but still, it'll keep you moving through the book instead of saying \\"this isn't for me\\", ya know?<br /><br />I found myself wanting to highlight a sentence here and there. An \\"aha!\\" that made me want to be able to read it again when I feel lost the next time, etc. Or something funny that I just appreciated as a writer.  In any case, I've found a new author to read, she feels like a woman I could have drinks with and laugh, cry or just get a kick out of. If this book ever was turned into a movie, it would be beautiful and hilarious and raw all at once. I'm thinking...Sandra Bullock or anyone who can pull off vulnerable and funny at the same time.the meditation stuff, fast forward through a paragraph or two, but don't give up.

B000001DU5|5.0|I must start off by saying that I may seem to have a small partiality toward Tears for Fears being that it is a large representation of fond memories from my childhood.  However I should also add that even if I hadn't listened to them as a child I still would find their kind of music alluring.  To put it as a fellow reveiwer did \\"in my mind, there are certain bands or singers who define a decade\\" and Tears for Fears does just that for the 80's.  I couldn't give you a favorite song off of this album but I could tell you that there are only two tracks that I often find myself skipping, those being track 8 and 12.  It's interesting to me also the kinds of movies that attract and incorporate songs from this album into their soundtrack, such as Real Genius and Donnie Darko -two of the greatest movies in the world of cinema both taking place in the 1980's.  I guess everything that has a connection with Tears for Fears is an awesome product of that era.  hah

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Oy vey.  Verily, I vent the virtues of the volcanic and violent V FOR VENDETTA.  No vain variation can vex the verisimilitude of a vital venture to shake up a vapid populace--although opinions may vary.  Indeed, this film voices a vortex of vile violence surrounding vintage virtuality.<br /><br />Starring the vainglorious Hugo Weaving (a vigilante Elrond); and Natalie Portman, who needs to be more voluptuous.  Yet each scene is stolen by vulgar John Hurt, who proves to be a most violent, vitriolic villain.  Stephen Rea is just, kind of there, but I vigress, er digress.<br /><br />A vicissitude of voluminous vulgarity (yet often velvety), V FOR VENDETTA often approaches even venereal delight.  Which makes it, dear friends, quite valid.  And Guy Fawkes only vandalizes my vexation, yet what a virtuoso!  Oy vey, indeed.<br />--D. Mikels, Author (Vexed), [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]

B00005JKGZ|4.0|This movie is a Valentine to the \\"good old days\\",days that are viewed through gold tinted lenses and I defy all but the most curmudgeonly not to yield to its pleasures.It features a near peak Judy Garland impeccably directed by Vincente Minnelli in a movie that looks at a year in the life of an affluent middle class St Louis family .The father ,and head of the family (at least notionally)is Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames).The family consists of mother Anne (Mary Astor),two older daughters named Ethel(Garland)and Rose (Lucille Bremmer)and two much younger ones Agnes (Joan Carroll)and the baby of the brood Tootie(the winsome and charming Margaret O'Brien),and a son Lon (Hank Daniels).Completing the household are the capricious grandfather (Harry Davenport)and the faithful family maid Katie played by the scene stealing Marjorie Main.Marriage is on the mind of the two eldest daughters;Rose is being courted by one beau at home and is corresponding with another who is away at college in the East while Ethel is attracted to the boy next door John Truett (Tom Drake).Agnes and Tootie are still mischevous children   The movie looks at the life of the family over a year ,a year in which the city prepares to play host to the 1904 World's Fair ,the scenes of which are beautifully recreated by the art team under the skilled direction of Cedric Gibbons .Indeed the art team deserve special kudos for their work on the movie -the interiors are also sumptuous ,rich in colour and detail so this is amovie that always looks beguiling .events covered include Halloween and Christmas ,a season overshadowed by family tensions as a move to New York is in the offing .This gives a memorable bitter sweet tinge to Garland's moving rendition of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas ,a song which gains added complexity from its placement in the movie.The other musical highlight and the big production number is The Trolley Song ,and also memorable is the Skip To My Lou sequence.  Plot is not the strong point of the movie ,and these are provided by a stellar cast ,period detail and a string of tuneful ,melodic songs,all bathed in a warm lustous technicolor.  This is one of the warmest and most charming of musicals ,a portrait of an altogether more innocent and less cynical era ,a triumphant celebration of middle clasa Americana     Unashamedly nostalgic ,this is a lovely movie and should be seen by those wanting a warm hearted celebration of the past and family values
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is great so far.  It's a hard show to put on with all the characters and scenes.  I think HBO has done a great job with the casting and putting different story lines in the show.  They are fleshing out the characters now and we are slowly getting more into the story.  The scenes with Sookie and Bill are mesmerising.  The are trying to take us on the journey with Sookie, in the latest episode showing that vampires can be very dangerous.  The music is spectacular and the opening of each show is divine.  I'm thrilled that they upped for another season.
B0000033PB|1.0|Back in the day, my older brother was a huge ELP fan.  I didn't really appreciate or understand Emerson's more complicated work, but generally got to be familiar with it.  Recently, I've been giving the old stuff a serious listen (ELP, Trilogy, BSS, Tarkus, etc.) and redeveloping my appreciation of Emerson.    I recently came across a copy of Black Moon.  I had just listened to The Barbarian before deciding to switch to the \\"new\\" (to me anyway) album.  I couldn't find anything on it that approached the \\"crunchy\\" sound of The Barbarian, or anything that was up to what I'd consider to be Emerson's standard of composition.    I can't really evaluate it from the standpoint of ELP's more lyrical \\"songlike\\" stuff.  I like the old songs (C'est La Vie, From the Beginning, Benny the Bouncer, etc) well enough, but they were always kind of piggybacked on Kieth Emerson's signature style and harder stuff (Karn Evil 9 2nd Impression, the Piano Concerto, Tarkus, etc).  An album with none of the \\"crunchy\\" stuff is no good to me.

I like Daron, but I wasn't sure if he could pull off a whole album.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I can honestly say that I like every song on this album and I can't say that for too many cd's.  I would definitely buy this, even if I'd never heard of Daron Malakian.
B000002AH9|5.0|One day in my early 20s, I was browsing in the small music section that used to exist on the mezzanine floor of the Doubleday bookstore in New York City on Fifth Avenue just south of 57th Street. [You may consider it noteworthy that I remember *exactly* where I was when this happened.]      My fledgling jazz knowledge at that time was such that I knew the importance of Billie Holiday's name - though I couldn't have identified her voice. So I looked over one of her records - but without any particular interest in purchasing one.    Then a strange man, in both senses of the word, who struck me as middle-aged - though anyone between 30 and 60 might have qualified to me then - shook his head at me discouragingly and sighed, \\"Young people can't really appreciate Billie Holiday.\\" My vast dignity deeply affronted, I left to do my browsing elsewhere.    Now I know he was right. But had I been in his place [and in writing this review, perhaps in some way I can be] I would have phrased it more encouragingly for the younger man: \\"What is so remarkable is how her work deepens in meaning as one returns to it at advancing ages.\\"    I don't remember which of her records that man saw me looking at. Given my limited expertise and budget, it was probably a \\"Greatest Hits\\" of the kind I would condescend towards today.     But the meaning in what that man couldn't have communicated to me is best found in \\"Lady in Satin\\".    Now you may not be in the market for a harrowing. But make no mistake: this record *is* the summit of Holiday's art - and, by extension, of female blues singing in general.    If you're skeptical of that claim, consider that no less an authority than Francis Albert Sinatra said - the year after this music was recorded - \\"Lady Day is unquestionably the most important influence on American popular singing in the last twenty years.\\"    Please read that sentence a second time.     Then you'll know that if she declared this her masterpiece, she has earned your respect ofher opinion.

B000XPU5NY|5.0|English prog rockers Genesis released its recent live album entitled Live Over Europe 2007 in November of 2007.<br />Since the band's 1998 breakup, Genesis fans stirred rumors of and hoped for a reunion of the \\"classic\\" line-up with keyboard player Tony Banks, singer/drummer Phil Collins, guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford, original singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. However, Gabriel turned it down and Hackett backed out as well. Finally in 2006, Banks/Collins/Rutherford decided to press on with a reunion tour with longtime touring guitarist/bass player Daryl Stuermer and drummer Chester Thompson.<br />The band toured Europe (which this CD was taken from 20 shows in Europe) and the US last year and I flew back to my native Boston, MA to see Genesis live in September of 2007 and was one of the happiest nights of my life. I am glad I got to see this great show because, as of now, the band's 2007 tour turned out to be their last as Collins officially announced his retirement from music and performing earlier this year to be a full time dad to his two young sons in Switzerland and also retired because of some hearing damage (he's lost half of his hearing in his left ear) plus damaged some discs in his spine to the point where he has a hard time using his hands. If you watch this tour's off-shoot DVD When in Rome, Phil made it known that he saw this Genesis tour as closure on the touring part of his life.<br />What we're left of on the Live Over Europe 2007 album (and the When in Rome DVD) is proof that Genesis were still a musical force to be reckoned with. The band played lots of deep favorites and hits on the tour.<br />The opening \\"Duke's Intro\\" combines the intro of \\"Behind the Lines\\" and outro of \\"Duke's End\\" was a great way to start the disc. We segue into a spirited \\"Turn It On Again\\". Then we have superb live versions of \\"No Son of Mine\\" and \\"Land Of Confusion\\". Next is a mindblowing \\"In The Cage\\" medley (including soaring keyboard work from Banks and included bits of \\"Cinema Show\\" and \\"Duke's Travels\\") which gives way to a beautiful version of \\"Afterglow\\". Next is the ballad \\"Hold On My Heart\\" which is a great version. Next is a stellar version of \\"Home By The Sea/Second Home By The Sea\\". Next is Phil singing and drumming flawlessly on \\"Follow You Follow Me\\". We then have the powerful \\"Firth Of Firth\\" (Excerpt) with great guitar solos from Steurmer. The first CD ends with an extended \\"I Know What I Like\\" (though the tambourine jig was edited off of the CD but is available on the When in Rome DVD and the various Encore Series concerts that Genesis recorded on the tour (every night in the US and Europe was recorded)).<br />The second disc starts with a haunting \\"Mama\\". Next is the gorgeous \\"Ripples\\" (with beautiful 12-string guitar from Mike). We follow with the singalong \\"Throwing It All Away\\". The epic \\"Domino\\" follows and was a great version. Next is Phil and Chester's stellar drum duet, which they humorously dubbed \\"Conversations With Two Stools\\". They start their solo on two bar stools, before easily seguing onto their respective drumkits. It's phenomenal and segues into a thunderous \\"Los Endos\\". We close the regular set with a medley of \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\". We then have a contagious encore starting with the fun and upbeat \\"I Can't Dance\\" before closing with \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\".<br />Live Over Europe 2007 is a superb live album (although it's a shame that the album didn't sell well in the US) and due to Phil Collins' retirement in 2011 due to injuries to his back and loss of feeling in his hands, this is the swan song of Genesis and they left us with a great live album.

Thanks for the memories Genesis!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0375826726|2.0|With the rising prices of oil hitting the U.S. with raging force, it pleases me that books such as this one are published. Instead of paying nearly $1,000 in oil to heat my home this winter, I have purchased this book in bulk for a very cheap price. My sources cannot be named due to confidentially policies, but I saved nearly 70 percent by using this book to  keep the fires alive this winter instead of cranking up the fernace.  This book is a great page burner -- pun intended.  You skim through this book with a glimmer of hope that something interesting may happen, but you are let down when you realize that this whole adventure is based around a sword. The art on the cover isn't the most creative either. Maybe that dragon will breathe fire onto this book and spare everyone a bad read.
B0018CWWLE|5.0|English prog rockers Genesis released its recent live DVD entitled When in Rome 2007 this past June only at Wal-Mart stores here in the United States.<br />Since the band's 1998 breakup, Genesis fans stirred rumors of and hoped for a reunion of the \\"classic\\" line-up with keyboard player Tony Banks, singer/drummer Phil Collins, guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford, original singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett. However, Gabriel turned it down and Hackett backed out as well. Finally in 2006, Banks/Collins/Rutherford decided to press on with a reunion tour with longtime touring guitarist/bass player Daryl Stuermer and drummer Chester Thompson.<br />The band toured Europe (which this DVD was taken from the final show filmed in Rome, Italy in July of 2007) and the US last year and I flew back to my native Boston, MA to see Genesis live in September of 2007 and was one of the happiest nights of my life. I am glad I got to see this great show because, as of now, the band's 2007 tour turned out to be their last as Collins officially announced his retirement from music and performing earlier this year to be a full time dad to his two young sons in Switzerland and also retired because of some hearing damage (he's lost half of his hearing in his left ear). Watching this DVD's third DVD documentary Come Rain or Shine, Phil made it clear that he saw this Genesis tour as closure on the touring part of his life.<br />What we're left of on When in Rome (and the offshoot CD Live Over Europe) is proof that Genesis are still a musical force to be reckoned with. The band played lots of deep favorites and hits on the tour.<br />The funny montage film opening as the band hits the stage sets the tone and when the map hit Rome (would be a different city each night worldwide) they kicked off with the opening \\"Duke's Intro\\" combines the intro of \\"Behind the Lines\\" and outro of \\"Duke's End\\" was a great way to start the show. We segue into a spirited \\"Turn It On Again\\". Then we have superb live versions of \\"No Son of Mine\\" and \\"Land Of Confusion\\". Next is a mindblowing \\"In The Cage\\" medley (including soaring keyboard work from Banks and included bits of \\"Cinema Show\\" and \\"Duke's Travels\\") which gives way to a beautiful version of \\"Afterglow\\". Next is the ballad \\"Hold On My Heart\\" which is a great version. Next is a stellar version of \\"Home By The Sea/Second Home By The Sea\\". Next is Phil singing and drumming flawlessly on \\"Follow You Follow Me\\". We then have the powerful \\"Firth Of Firth\\" (Excerpt) with great guitar solos from Steurmer. The first DVD ends with an extended \\"I Know What I Like\\" (with the full tambourine jig which was edited off of the Live Over Europe CD but is available here and the various Encore Series concerts that Genesis recorded on the tour (every night in the US and Europe was recorded)).<br />The second DVD starts with a haunting \\"Mama\\". Next is the gorgeous \\"Ripples\\" (with beautiful 12-string guitar from Mike). We follow the singalong \\"Throwing It All Away\\". Phil's hilarious \\"Domino Principle\\" speech precedes the epic \\"Domino\\" which was a great version. Next is Phil and Chester's stellar drum duet, which they humorously dubbed \\"Conversations With Two Stools\\". They start their solo on two bar stools, before easily seguing onto their respective drumkits. It's phenomenal (seen to be believed here) and segues into a thunderous \\"Los Endos\\". We close the regular set with a medley of \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight\\" and \\"Invisible Touch\\" with the obligatory pyro. We then have a contagious encore starting with the fun and upbeat \\"I Can't Dance\\" before closing with \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\".<br />The bonuses on the first two DVDs are rehearsal footage and interviews. The third DVD is Come Rain or Shine which was a documentary from rehearsals in 2006 to the Rome show.<br />When in Rome is a superb live DVD but if this is the swan song<br />of Genesis (as Phil Collins wants us to believe it), then they left us with a great live DVD.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0011NVC98|3.0|For years we at RiffTrax have lived under the mistaken belief that we are Beowulf. So we were shocked when a cartoon version of Ray Winstone squeezed into a tiny pair of leather battle panties (LBPs) and set us straight in no uncertain terms. And he's right - HE. IS. BEOWULF!! Though it took some getting used to the idea that we are not Beowulf, in all honesty it's been a whole lot more pleasant to come into the office and see pants where one once saw nothing but a sea of LBPs.<br /><br />But if you haven't yet exceeded your limit, may we suggest you download our hilarious new RiffTrax for Beowulf in which a fully-clothed Mike, Kevin and Bill take on our less-than-clothed hero, his extremely unclothed lizardy paramour (played with big-boobs gusto by Digilina Jolie), and a disappointingly unclothed Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />IT! IS! FUNNY!!!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Almost all of my Amazon reviews are book reviews (including McCullough's \\"John Adams\\"), but I was so moved by this HBO miniseries that I had to recommend it. The acting is superb, the score is wonderful and the story is moving. While the book certainly stands on its own as a monumental work of research and writing, this miniseries beautifully highlights the ups and downs of John Adams's life and the birth of our nation. John Adams is a true American hero and this series captures that so well.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I checked out Within Temptation because I heard they were similar to the goth rock band Evanescence. I bought the Heart of Everything and, as much as I love Evanescence (Amy Lee has such a beautiful, lush voice), these guys top them and take things to a whole other level. I have almost all of WT's albums now.     I looked forward to their latest concert on CD/DVD and I was blown away. This show is both a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I love the visuals and lead singer Sharon de Adel has the most heart-breakingly beautiful voice. Singing effortlessly, she sounds like an angel. Sharon also knows how to connect with her audience and wears some really stunning outfits.    The band is superbly accompanied by the Metropole Orchestra and the Pa'dam Choir, and the concert features three guest performers--George Oosthoek, Anneke van Giersbergen, and Keith Caputo. Each is a talented singer, and the three add greatness to the show.    The only flaw is that the CD does not, for some reason, contain all the tracks from the concert. I wanted to hear the whole concert!!    I would recommend Anywhere But Home by Evanescence and End of an Era by Nightwish if you enjoy this CD/DVD set.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|The music alone is so fantastic, so full of emotions and completely lyric free. The different melodies and movements speak their own language as well as bring forth a whole range of different emotions. You can't help but picture beautiful landscape while listening to the soundtrack. It moves you and makes you feel as though you have butterflies in your stomach, I think that alone is worth it.

0786838655|5.0|Over the summer, I had to read a book for homework and then write about it. The assignment seemed unappealing until I came upon \\"Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief.\\" I read a couple pages thinking \\"Oh, another cheezy kid's fantasy.\\" When I read on, it drew me in. I am not the kind of person who gets excited about reading a book, but this book made me want to read it. I finished the book disappointed that it was over and it made me extemely eager continue the series.   I havn't started the second book yet, but I am looking forward to it.   READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!
B0000E5NPZ|5.0|Juliette Greco is perfection as the aging nightclub singer at a chic Paris boite, who sings to strangers night after night of a \\"street with no address.\\"  Irretrievably ravaged by time and perfidious love, Greco gives the part nearly everything she has; in her excellent Givenchy gown she bespeaks chic even as she allows emotion to tremble through her quack of a voice.  As she sings the haunting title track, Jean Seberg is twirling around on the dancefloor simultaneously drinking Greco in and obsessing about her own memories of a colorful, blue-splashed summer on the French Riviera, the summer in which the mystic numbers \\"7\\" and \\"e\\" combined to form a summer of death and disaster.<br /><br />Preminger is superbly understated here, his direction of Seberg assured and yet improvisatory.  Some have criticized the way that Seberg, Niven, and Kerr never even try to sound like French people, and some say that the heavily accented English of the fourth lead, Mylene Demongeot, sounds like gobbledegook and makes her co-stars seem even flatter.  None of them is actually convincing, and Niven and Kerr are oddly miscast, but all of them are great in their own lights.  Kerr is believable as a dress designer, Niven sort of believable as a girl's best friend kind of dad, though neither of them seem sexy enough for their parts.  Maybe in real life David Niven was some sort of super playboy but I'm just not feeling it here.  Why didn't they just hire Jimmy Stewart if they wanted a palsy kind of older actor to be Seberg's father?  She seems like she's in love with him, or does she just feel responsible for his happiness since the mother's death?  I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and to discover that she had \\"accidentally\\" killed the mother, but we never get that story, maybe in the sequel?<br /><br />What's great about the movie--beyond the main cast?  Saul Bass' title design has got to be among his very best: the pattern of gold coins and crosses moving along a black screen like stars in the night sky, gradually being supplanted by red hearts and blue waves, and finally resolving themselves into the famous line drawing of Juliette Greco's crying face--OMG, you will feel like you've died and woken up in France.<br /><br />Geoffrey Horne as the boy next door, especially the scene where Cecile musters up all her courage and runs to his house, skips through the hallways like a thing possessed, and then pauses outside a door.  She throws open the door and you see a dimly lit room and Geoffrey Horne asleep, face down, on a single bed, the whole room lit up by the eerie, glowing white of his incredibly revealing underwear.  Va va voom, no wonder she jumps on that law student!<br /><br />Also the color design of the film, how the present is in black and white, but the flashbacks in color.  The first, Juliette Greco scene,is especially impressive in this regard as Seberg, haunted by the past, is glimpsed dancing over the shoulder of her partner, until shards of color (blue) bombard her in triangles stripped into the negative (I guess) that finally overwhelm her and propel the film directly into the past,  Must be taken from those Jazz cut-outs of Matisse; this sequence is a direct ancestor of Kylie Minogue's Riviera-like videos for \\"Slow\\" and \\"On a Night Like This.\\"  In fact the Kylie-Rutger Hauer relationship in the \\"On a Night Like This\\" clip definitely smacks of the Seberg-Niven one here in BT.  Maybe I'm overthinking this.e night sky, gradually being supplanted by red hearts and blue waves, and finally resolving themselves into the famous line drawing of Juliette Greco's crying face--OMG, you will feel like you've died and woken up in France.

B000W9DTG6|5.0|Got this as a gift from a friend, took it out of its bag and thought it was just Ocean's 13 in a special edition box (due to the placement of 11 and 12).  That alone would be great, but it doesn't compare to realizing I just can't read, and that all three are here. 5 stars for the product, 0 for my logic.
B001GKO45K|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl made this film during the Nuremberg congress of the Nazi Party.  It is perhaps the greatest example of propaganda in existance today.  Riefenstahl has been hailed by many as groundbreaking.  She used pioneering techniques that involved cranes, tracking rails and many cameras working at the same time.  This is the the greatest example of historical/government propaganda of all time.  An absolute must own!!!
B000W91RUG|4.0|I fell in love with this show when it first aired and I enjoy watching the whole first season at once.  The only reason I would have not given it the highest rating is I feel they could have done more outtakes and extras.
B00005JMK0|4.0|The video quality is EXTREMELY BAD and there is no information on the DVD or its packaging to tell you who released it in Australia.  My old VHS tape of this movie that I copied off of cable (24 years ago) still looks better than Australia's horrid DVD.<br /><br />They claim it's new (on eBay), and factory sealed.  The sellers all say: &#34;We do not sell PIRATE, BOOTLEG, ASIAN or ILLEGAL COPIES&#34;.  But it's still got to be illegally made.<br /><br />The cost of postage to send this back overseas is just not worth spending the time or the money even for a refund of half as much so the purchasing of this DVD from Australia is just one great big BAD experience.  Has anyone else bought this crappy thing from Australia?<br /><br />I threw it away.  With disgust, I just broke it in half and just threw it away.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just ordered the Region B import from the UK, and it looks great. It's an official release.<br /><br />So, just avoid the crappy copy from Australia.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|For those people who an not familiar with David Gilmour, He is the reason that Pink Floyd is still in existence. He has only become better with age. This concert's audio mastering ...as well as excellent cinematography is top shelf and would exercise the heck out of ANY Hi-End Theater gear With separate Amps and power hungry speakers. If it is turned up .....there better be air blowing. They simply fill the audio spectrum all the way up. Anyone whom truly appreciates Great quality music should own at least this one because it comes with the Cd's. I had to babysit my system for REMEMBER THAT NIGHT so that I could play the DVD at 1(ONE)speed to have track separation. I had to rip the audio while sitting there fading the cheers, yeelping.....Etc.   I build Handmade custom length A/V cables using all US parts Including Silver solder. I use Gilmour's stuff to Sound & video check My ULTRA RGB Cables. We are a Factory certified LG PLASMA warranty shop.

B001BKXUOQ|5.0|I was very surprised my the new album. I own every Slipknot album to date and I will say that this one is the best. It's has a very Iowa-esk feeling about but yet it is very melodic like Subliminal Verses. This album goes in many directions as far as music goes. I was very impressed.

B00127RAJY|5.0|i own many workout dvds and this one is a new fav. jilian gives you a total body workout, combining aerobic and strength training, in about 20 minutes. in many of the moves you work two muscle groups at once, thus adding to its effectiveness. i would consider myself to be in pretty good shape, yet i found level 1 to be quite challenging (it also help me discover what parts of my body were weak and needed attention). i have no doubt that as i advance through all the levels, i will be shredded...i've only done the first workout a few times and i'm already seeing results.

B0017ASV1C|3.0|Righteous Kill    De Niro and Al Pacino co-star in a police procedural cop thriller.  They're partners and police detectives on the verge of retirement.  The two wind up with a major case.   Someone is hunting down people who have been acquitted, but still done the crime, and executing them.  Are Turk and Rooster still up for the job?  The answer, of course, is yes.  I liked this movie even though some might find it a little cynical.  Even as the two are investigating, two other detectives start investigating Turk as a suspect!    What makes this film memorable is not so much the plot and its twists, but the banter and interaction between Pacino and De Niro. They're just brilliant, sardonic and funny.  As one of the police says, \\"They're like Lennon and McCartney.  Not an inch between them.\\"  Some people will think that the twists are cheating, but I don't think so.  It's clever and fits with the story.  The key to \\"Righteous Kill,\\" for me, was that Pacino's character, nicknamed Rooster, is a strategizing chess player.  If you know that, then you'll know how he thinks, and the ending will make sense.    Rating: 3.5  Solid and dependable.
1594201749|5.0|Playing the Enemy is a very timely book. In these days when nations are often more divided than before, Nelson Mandela's instinct to show respect, friendliness, and common purpose with those who saw him as an enemy is a beacon that lights up the potential for all people to come together to accomplish more. John Carlin has used the Rugby World Cup imaginatively to illustrate the essence of President Mandela's approach. Mr. Carlin is a wonderful story teller, and you'll feel chills as you read the many great moments he brilliantly captures in Playing the Enemy.<br /><br />Leaders have always used foreign enemies to bring their purpose together. Who realized that this could be done at the level of sport rather than through war as a way to unify a country where people were deeply suspicious (even paranoid) about one another?<br /><br />I was glad to see that Mr. Carlin provided lots of background about how someone imprisoned for decades became the leader of a reconstituted nation in South Africa and went on to accomplish things that not even the most optimistic would have expected. President Mandela's story is one for the ages, and this way of telling the story makes it easier to understand for those who never saw South Africa during the Apartheid regime.<br /><br />Although I had long studied and worked to help change the government in South Africa from the inside and outside, the political impact of the international boycott of the South African rugby team had been lost to me. I hope those who would like to encourage governments to behave more appropriately towards their people will remember this example.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Carlin!
0553582461|5.0|Yes, I will be honest here.  Several years ago whilst nannying for my little cousins, my older cousin introduced me to the Farseer Trilogy. I loved it.  A few laters I was able to get my hands on The Liveship Traders Trilogy--I am not allowed to speak of those in my circle of friends for the simple fact I will not cease singing the praises to the point of irritating everyone.  So as you might imagine I was all gung-ho about reading \\"The Tawny Man\\".<br /><br />Well... I rated the first two books of the trilogy with a mediocre three stars. Sorry, but after all the excitement of the other two trilogies, the Tawny Man struck me as dull.  It was with some reservation and mostly my meticulous need to finish what I had started that I picked up \\"Fool's Fate\\".<br /><br />Fortunately I spent the weekend with a cold and was thus able to devour the 900+ wonder.  Not to offend fans of the Tawny Man, but to me this was well worth reading the first two.  Robin Hobb ended the trilogy (and I suppose the saga including the other two trilogies as well) with nothing less than a bang that her marvelous imagination so deserved.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the action.  Though I usually like ponderous exposition, the dull pacing of the first two did get to me and I was more than ready to get to the meat of the story. Perhaps it was that--the meat of the story, the act of getting to what was promised all along, the conclusion of a mission, of destiny!<br /><br />Hobb's story is a fairly simple one--I'm sure there are plenty of more creative plots out there.  But it is hardly mind-numbing, and Hobb tells her tale, one of many references to the classics and always a homey feeling of a familiar town and country, well.  She knows her action, she knows her character, and she was ready to finish the story without forcing the ending.  The emotion was real and apparently what I had waited all nine books for.  She has truly set up multiple cultures and lands with rich traditions that fortunately she never felt required an obnoxious encyclopedia.  She knows the balance between the fairy tale ending I love and something properly realistic, giving this happiness without the sugary and unbelievable goo.<br /><br />Thank-you, Ms. Hobb.s encyclopedia.  She knows the balance between the fairy tale ending I love and something properly realistic, giving this happiness without the sugary and unbelievable goo.    Thank-you, Ms. Hobb.
0156030470|5.0|Stylistically midway between her more traditionally structured novels like The Voyage Out, and experimental, modernist works like The Waves, To the Lighthouse melds elements of both experiment and tradition, making a balanced, well-organized, richly textured novel.  Woolf is very adept at re-creating the passage of time in bold, unexpected ways.  The brilliant middle interlude in this novel, Time Passes, is perhaps a case study in this.  The reader is treated to an omniscient overview of the weathering of the Ramsay House.  All this takes place under the watchful light of the Lighthouse of the title, sending out its beam to a world which is destroying itself only to be reconstituted as something wholly different, completely other. In Woolf's body of work To the Light House captures the very best of her prose skills and conceptual genius in one novel.
B000K4X5XA|5.0|Even if you compare this movie to today's superhero movies such as Iron Man or The Dark Knight, you would enjoy this movie more.  There is a more human element to this and this is in part due to great writers and phenomenal actors.  The problem with most superhero movies is they have a lead character that is quite muscle-bound and finding such an actor that can also act is not a common phenomenon.  Enter Christopher Reeves, who had both the physique and talent and you have history in the making - the first comic book movie without the camp.  Add in Margot Kidder, who I believe is the best Lois Lane, Gene Hackman, and Marlon Brando and writers from the Godfather and you have an epic, epic movie.  The only thing negative that can possibly be said of this film is its special effects which is somewhat dated  but still hold up quite nicely minus some Superman flying scenes that appear somewhat fake.  But in terms of story, directing, acting, screenplay, Oscar-winning score, and cinematography - no other superhero adaptation can beat this movie.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is actually the album that would/should have been made before the black album.    Do not be fooled by the negative posters here: this CD is every bit as good as anything on the Lightning/Master/Justice albums. There. I said it. The production is superior, and the instrumental progression and song progression and segment structures are generally more complex, progressive, and hook-filled than their early work.    This album is more Master of Puppets than Master of Puppets.
B00000I41J|5.0|Pure Jazz. For a remastered album it is as brilliant as when first heard it in 1959, only more refined and as excellent as it always was, Miles Davis should share all the credits with Cannonball Adderley as without his input, this album would not be as good as it is. Hank, Art & Sam also have a large input, but Cannonball & Miles shine through in an excellent example of good Jazz.
B001DE29SS|5.0|If you're anything like me, the almost semi-annual relapse and recovery of Robert Downey Jr. has been an interesting periodic feature of the morning news. After a while one begins to question why does Hollywood put up with him when there is no shortage of talented actors desperately trying to make it in Hollywood? Why would producers and studios, who are so financially dependent on their productions going off without a hitch, take yet another chance on Robert Downey, Jr? Then I saw Chaplin, and I understood.<br /><br />The intensity and power of the Robert Downey's performance in this film is the stuff of Oscars and true movie legend! It's both a beautiful performance and a beautiful film!<br /><br />Somehow Sir Richard Attenborough got out of Downey the kind of performance that can sustain a career, and a legend. But Sir Richard's mastery didn't stop there. He got spectacular performance out of everyone, including a young, pre-X-Files David Duchovny. (I know I misspelled that. But you know who I mean.)<br /><br />In summation, Robert Downey's performance is every bit the equal of James Dean's in Giant, East of Eden or Rebel without a Cause, and maybe that's what we should keep in mind. For unlike Dean, another self-destructive personality, Robert Downey has not driven off the cliff yet, and hopefully he never will.
B000002C25|4.0|\\"Be Here Now\\" is Oasis's third studio album.  Over the years, it has been criticized for sloppy recording and subpar lyrics.  Overall, the criticism doesn't hold up, as there are many standout Oasis tracks on the album.  The album has it's great moments, like My Big Mouth, Stand By Me, and Don't Go Away.  On this album, Oasis relies less on beautiful melodies and more on a big sound characterized by many guitars, keyboards, and vocal overdubs.  \\"Be Here Now\\" is their last great album, and is just as great as their first two albums.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|Like alot of people I bought Rockferry for the song Mercy.  Mercy was getting alot of air play and the song was kind of catchy so I gave it a chance.  Mercy really rocks and is a well polished song.  However the rest of the album is more of a soul / rb album.  Duffy has a great voice but each song builds up and just at it is getting ready to peak it stops.  I would anticpate her next album will have a more finished result much like Joss Stone's early career.  This is a very good first try and I am sure that we Duffy will be around for awhile.<br /><br />I feel that one drawback to Duffy is she will be compared to Amy Winehouse, Aidle, and Joss Stone who all are competing for title of best British Soul Artist.  It seems like we are in the middle of a 2nd British Invasion.  To compare the artists is not fair as they are each strong enough to stand alone.

But, as someone has already said here, no wonder occurred. I found only FOUR minutes of the track \\"Broken, Beat and Scarred\\" were worth listening to, the rest are fillers with some glimpses of what used to be Metallica...
0439023483|5.0|when you read these reviews almost everyone says it addicting, you cant put it down, i totally agree. When i fist picked this book up i ignored the warnings and started to read, after a few pages i was hooked. Beware, if you plan on reading this make sure you give this book a whole day, that way no one distracts you. Sadly i started this book in the evening and wasnt able to put it down, getting a little less than three hours of sleep. this book just makes you want to find out what will happen all the way to the end, keeping you on the edge of your seat:)

They admitted it wasn't in a true 1:85 widescreen and will not fill a 16x9 hi-def T.V. (looks great on a 4:3 T.V.) After playing mind checkers with the Disney operator for a few minutes, they could'nt give a reason why it is advertised as a widescree movie.

B0019IB26I|5.0|As Incredible as music can get, John Mayer transcends Incredible to Extraordinary to Phenomenal to ... where will it end?  I loved his first 2 major commercial releases Room for Squares and Heavier Things.  After those releases, new John Mayer music was not appearing on commercial radio, which is either a sign that he was not recording or that commercial radio is in major decline.  Three years later we got \\"Waiting on the World\\" (Continuum), but was that all there was from that release?  Especially when he won the Grammy?  No, which answers why commercial radio is in decline.  Why we weren't hearing \\"more\\" is related to the change or departure in style that we were accustomed to from John Mayer and how we don't tolerate change in Artists we've come to \\"know\\".      I was fortunate to DVR an appearance on (PBS no less) Austin City Limits from October 2007.  It re-opened my mind and presented me with the possibility that the reason I wasn't hearing John's music had more to do with me than it had to do with him.      Now I am back on board.  And if you are out there wondering if it's worth it, well all you have to do is answer the question: \\"Did you hear the imprints of R&B or Blues in any his acoustic stuff\\"?  If you did, than you didn't see Continuum as a departure or change but as a Continuum.  You will see \\"Where the Light Is\\", as a compilation of poetry and music by an extraordinary talent communicating via an instrument you would think he invented.  And to think he is so young will make us old folks pine to Stop This Train.
1400063515|5.0|The \\"black swan\\" of the title is any of those sudden, unpredictable, and relevant events that happen. Taleb's main point, proven and repeated along the book, is that it is impossible to make predictions with any degree of accuracy. What we DON'T know is much more important than what we do know. And we'll never know how many black swans have not happened by pure chance. Taleb distinguishes between the two areas of life: Mediocristan and Extremistan. In the first one, variations occur within a recognizable range, and therefore in a large group no deviation, large as it may be, significantly alters the average (e.g. the height of people). In Extremistan, things may happen in a different order of magnitude (money or power). It is there in Extremistan that black swans appear. Taleb is very irreverent, and with reason, towards \\"academic\\" knowledge, always ossified, beaurocratized, and in the comfort zone. He also attacks the notion of something called \\"social\\" sciences, as if they could exist, not to speak of their predictive success. He also distinguishes between those fields in which legitimate \\"experts\\" exist (engineering, medicine), and those where experts can't exist (politics, economics, culture).     A following thesis is that we do not properly get ready for black swans because we make mistakes in our thinking. We are always seeking confirmations to our initial hypotheses, instead of trying to disprove them and get on the right path. We fall into the narrative phallacy, where past events look easy to have predicted, and then we look for suspects to blame. Whose fault was September 11? There has to be someone, since now it is very clear to all of us that it would have been easy to predict and prevent. Or First World War, for which any number of reasons and omens have been found. Phallacies. We can NOT predict our own lives, much less History. Another problem is silent evidence. Taleb tells us about a Roman priest who once told Cicero a story: some people who had suffered a shipwreck started to ardently pray to the gods and they were rescued. That's proof that the gods exist. Cicero answered: What about all the guys that have prayed and nevertheless have perished? When looking at that which has worked for some people, we usually ignore the many who have been left along the road (\\"How to become a millionaire in ten stpes\\"). Then comes the ludic phallacy, exemplified in game theory. Games occur within a controlled environment, with clear rules; life doesn't. Now, if we can't predict anything relevant, how are we to live? Getting ready. Preparing for black swans. Minimizing the risk of negative black swans, and maximizing exposure to positive black swans.     Very good book, iconoclastical, lucid and innovative. It reminded me of Howard Bloom and his \\"Lucifer Principle\\". Maybe the future of philosophy lies outside of cubicles and classrooms, and in the real world of business, politics, live culture. It¿s logical that that may be the case. Universities, institutionalized academia, the media, \\"experts\\", etc., have become murderers of free thinking, jails for rational debate.

0141439688|5.0|Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.     The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.       With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen.

B000OVLBHG|4.0|The soldiers of the future will be stupid, sexy and totally expendable. Remind me to leave a note to my great grandchildren telling them not to sign up for military service!<br /><br />The film is VERY loosely based on R. Heinlein's classic novel and borrows only the barest elements of its plot. P. Verhoeven's soldiers are kids right out of highschool: niave, petulant and easily swayed by lofty speeches about honor and duty. That, and they are full of blood and internal organs that are just begging to be splattered all over the place.<br /><br />The movie's fun is in the preposterously gruesome battle scenes between hordes of alien 'Bugs' and the tiny, poorly trained pin-cushions otherwise known as Humans. The troopers move from planet to planet, hand delivering nukes to the bugs while dying horribly and in large numbers themselves. All of this is not to be taken seriously, neither is the mostly superfluous love triangle between the main characters.<br /><br />Just sit back and enjoy the slaughter, boobies (if that's your cup 'o tea), and sly social commentary. Higher level brain functions are not required, but will reveal some added depth. Dolby 5.1 audio is available, but extra features are limited to director commentary.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I watched The Godfather Part I on Blu Ray, from Netflix, side by side, against the standard DVD, which I already owned. The Blu Ray  was played on a Panasonic machine, and the standard was played on a Toshiba HD machine, and so was upconverted. Both were watched on a Sharp Aquos 40 inch, and the input was simply switched back and forth to access one movie or the other. They were synchronized to play the same scenes side by side. And I have to say that I just don't understand the RAVE reviews amongst the videophile crowd, who seem to feel that the Coppola restoration provides levels of artistic fidelity hitherto unknown to mortal man. The fact is that some scenes were better on the Blu Ray (and as one reviewer on Amazon pointed out, very HD-like), and some scenes actually were better on the standard. In addition, there was a kind of hyper-contrast and orange-ness to everything on the Blu Ray, that not everyone is going to like. As for me, I wanted to like the Blu Ray better; I am something of a collector, and wanted an excuse to make the purchase, but in the end, I don't think that I will. For those who must, it won't be the worst investment you've ever made, to be sure, but please, let's stop with the hyperbole, already!
B00000K31V|4.0|Ever wake up from a vivid dream and wished that you could make it into a movie? If you're David Cronenberg, you don't have to wish, and the result is Existenz, an ethereal, strangely sensual odyssey into a world only the subconscious mind could conjure.<br /><br />A weird little movie with a befittingly weird title, Existenz flew under the radar during the 'Summer of the Matrix'. On the surface, Existenz is little more than a vague narrative of two unlikely companions, played by Law and Leigh, who alternate between reality and a virtual reality game called Existenz.<br /><br />On a deeper level, this film is an an exploration of the meaning of consciousness and reality and revisits Cronenberg's fascination with the power technology has over its creators. It features Cronenberg's trademark gooey special effects and organic weirdness, but the most striking element is the conspicuous eroticism of existenz's virtual world.<br /><br />Existenz is an unusual but entertaining and worthwhile film, and though it fails to fully hit home with some of its philosophical arguments, it connects well enough on others. A host of familiar names and faces round out the cast. The DVD offers little in the way of extras (just the theatrical trailer, which I didn't bother to watch). Dolby 4.0 is available, picture quality is great (only widescreen is offered on this disc).

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Overall, the combination of screenplay, directing, pacing, music, action, and acting make this not only the greatest screen version of Robin Hood ever, but one of the greatest all-time adventure classics. Adventure movies are no longer made, unfortunately, having been replaced by 'Action Movies.' An Action Movie is an Adventure Movie with a very bad case of ADHD, or maybe an Adventure Movie on meth, with a low IQ. Too bad, Adventure Movies were classier, and could be enjoyed by women and grown men as well as adolescent boys.<br /><br />Errol Flynn as Robin Hood is probably the greatest hero in any Adventure Movie. Just perfect, and the guy did his own sword-fighting, and took lessons from an world-class archer for the shooting scenes.<br /><br />Besides being great entertainment, Robin Hood is very well made from a technical point of view, but does not hit you over the head trying to be artsy-fartsy. The scene where Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are having the climactic fight, and they slide past the camera, while the camera seamlessly catches the perfect, fighting shadows, then seamlessly they slip back into camera is just fantastic.<br /><br />There is strong element of populist social commentary in this film. The poor and working people are in a state of deprivation and tyranny because King Richard has become entangled in a foreign military adventure.<br /><br />My favorite part, after the climactic sword fight, is when Robin gives Maid Marion a tour of the medieval equivalent of a Hooverville. This is a movie made in 1938, and this is a wonderful way of reminding the audience, and modern viewers, of what true poverty looks like. Later in this sequence, you can see Robin and Marion gaze lustfully after each other as they eat at the same table with the homeless. For this film's original audience, hunger was never too far away.<br /><br />This film blends the spirit of Romantic Adventure with a strong call to social justice. One of my top 10 all time favorite movies. I could watch it once a week.<br /><br />The documentary on the making of this film is also excellent, and increases my appreciation.  And of course the 2 Warner Bros. cartoons are also great.e documentary on the making of this film is also excellent, and increases my appreciation.

B00009L1TA|5.0|Panama after the Reagan's military intervention. The American armed forces are trying to keep the main passage of south American drug up north to the US under control. But that does not mean it is really what happens. In fact drug is flowing abundantly but not freely. Things have to be organized in the hands of the US citizens here, at least some of them, under a uniform or not. In one of the military special, very special units the sergeant discovers the truth and wants to stop it when on a mission. He will end up dead and several other members too, but the transportation of the drug out of the jungle and onto a plane to the US, along with one of the bodies will nearly succeed, though it will fail because the special agent and the female captain he is teaming with find out some details neither knew that imply the colonel is taking his share to let the drug go through. But nothing is that simple and that captain is going to discover even more and then she will be disarmed - psychologically though not militarily - and the film closes the way it had opened on Ravel's Bolero, that music that is a constant cyclical return of just a few notes. Will she go along with the survivors, and the special agent who seems to be the real coordinator, including of the killing of the sergeant? Difficult to know, though she accepts to eat with the administratively absent ones. It is interesting to go back to these films of an older time. 2003 was the time of another military adventure after a previous one a year before. The film was more or less trying to foresee the future of a military adventure in a foreign country. A real catastrophe because it brings rot right into the deepest inner circle of the republic, the armed forces. Five years later the lesson is clear cut and brilliant. Any military adventure that is based on the invasion of a country in order to bring down the local leader and take him to prison in a way or another for any reason you can imagine, in Panama it was drugs, in Iraq it was weapons of mass destruction, can only end up in rot and a full deception. What did Noriega want to do? Nationalize or take control of the Panama canal? Ronald Reagan when he was the Governor of California said: \\"the Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long-term lease. It is sovereign United States territory, every bit the same as Alaska and all the states that were carved from the Louisiana Purchase. We should end those negotiations and tell the General: we bought it, we paid for it, we build it, and we intend to keep it.\\" When he became the President of the US he toppled Noriega and took control of the canal zone. And in may 2008 the son of the general who nationalized the canal was praised by Bush for all the good work he is doing to develop the canal that is a national enterprise of Panama. You can never stop history. You can slow it down, but not stop it. It will go on in its direction and those who will have tried to stop it and will have slowed it down will also have brought onto the world a dire vengeance. History always has the last word. When you see practically the whole South America in the elected hands of what Ronald Reagan would have called communists you wonder if it was really worth it to invade Panama and to invade Granada and a few other things like that. When we see the Panamanian fiasco thirty years later we can wonder what the Iraqi fiasco is going to be in thirty years. The film is telling us that any invasion of a country produces in the medium run the completely reverse effect than the one expected in the very short run. And in the end it is those who resist the rot, corruption, in other words the innocent, that end up dead in such an adventure.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesin Iraq it was weapons of mass destruction, can only end up in rot and a full deception.

B0000640VN|5.0|I must say, this is a fabulous romantic comedy. It's flirty and fun, while still maintaining a level of class. Despite have a time-loopy premise to it, the primary focus is on chivalry and the timelessness of 'classic romance'. Another great quality of the film is that it is CLEAN. This is something that can be shared with younger viewers without having to experience the awkwardness of watching a sexual scene with an 11 year old. Hugh Jackman's performance is just fantastic. He truly brought his character to life and into this modern world. Meg Ryan did a wonderful job as well. Overall a spectacular film, and one I would highly recommend!!!
0316143472|4.0|David Sedaris is a writer who appreciates the finer things in life. The finer things we either ignore or simply don't see on a day-to-day basis. Throw in a dripping glob of neuroses and an erudite air of resignation and you too can arrive at the astute observations he so dutifully illustrates in his latest book, When You are Engulfed in Flames.<br /><br />I think of Sedaris as an unconventional connoisseur of sorts. From sweat angels to the acumen of easily procuring dishwashing jobs, Stadium Pals, flaming mice, husbandry for spiders named \\"Big Chief Tommy\\", confronting airplane irritants, and finally to \\"finishing\\" smoking while learning Japanese, his musings evoke a nostalgia for times and things past never yet experienced.<br /><br />This particular collection of essays centers around movement. Specifically regarding travel, Sedaris shares his experiences either en route to or upon arrival of the multitude of destinations to which he's traveled, some foreign, some domestic, all bizarre. Whether it be Japan, Thailand, France, the West Coast, Chicago, North Carolina, New York or wherever-have-you, his stories are ironic in that they all focus not on his destination, but rather the inner processing of his immediate surroundings, most notably his melancholy paranoia and courageous cynicism. It's more about the people he meets and his subsequent detachment from the normal workings of the world, not just the places he visits. It is the journey apparently, not the destination that matters. Sedaris' latest book is sublimely resigned, a comforting read for when the good times are indeed literally killing you.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This is a great, great album, one of Metallica's best and one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  Metallica is totally rejuvinated from the St. Anger misstep.  They play like a band possessed.  Every song on here is a Metallica masterpiece.  Metallica is the Stanley Kubrick of rock and roll, taking years between albums (and obsessing and obsessing over them), but when it's released, it's either awesome or pretty close to awesome.  Even the much maligned St. Anger has some brilliant moments.  Death Magnetic can stand next to Master of Puppets, ...and Justice for All (an album Death Magnetic gets compared to a lot here), or Ride the Lightning.<br /><br />I absolutely love The End of the Line.  It has one of the trickiest time signatures of any Metallica song, and the band gives a shattering performance of it.  Cyanide is one of my all time favorite Metallica songs, with a killer bass riff (courtesy of Robert Trujillo, his first studio album with Metallica), and absolute killer guitar riff.  All Nightmare Long is another scorcher.  It's equipped with not one but two killer guitar solos by Kirk Hammett.  His soloing, which has always gotten better with each subsequent album (sans St. Anger, where no solos were to be found for some reason), is fantastic here.  Suicide and Redemption, the band's first instrumental since Orion off the Master of Puppets album (To Live is To Die is mostly instrumental, it has some lyrics written by Cliff Burton), has another massive bass line by Trujillo and it's a great Metallica epic.  All of these songs go on for quite some time (like all classic Metallica songs).<br /><br />Metallica is functioning as a whole band here.  They all take songwriting credits (even Trujillo), and they don't play any games with the production here.  ...and Justice for All had Newsted's bass mixed in the back supposedly as a \\"hazing\\" ritual, which lessened the album a bit in many eyes.  Here Trujillo's bass is right up there, along side Ulrich's incredible drumming, and the brilliant twin guitar attack of Hetfield and Hammett.  Hetfield's lyrics are much better than St. Anger, which had some of the worst lyrics of Metallica's career.<br /><br />Metallica has shaken off the dust of the St. Anger debacle (more of a misguided attempt to recapture the old sound than a horrible album), and has come back fast, loud, strong, creative, and brilliant.  Despite this, there are some naysayers here screaming \\"this is not as good as their old stuff\\", and for those people, why don't you stop listening to Metallica then?  What the hell do you really want?  Kill 'em All Part 10?  Part 11?  Go form your own thrash metal band, then.  Get lost.  I'm tired of hearing your incessant complaining.  Metallica doesn't need you; I don't need you.  Go find some other band to trash.<br /><br />Metallica is an awesome band with incredible staying power.  In a business where bands are lucky to be around for a few years, Metallica has been around for 25 YEARS.  There's a reason that Metallica has stayed on the top of their game for all those years, as opposed to most of the other 80's metal bands (Poison for example), who are nothing but nostalgia acts now.  Metallica will never be a nostalgia act.  There is a reason that this album opened up at #1.  It's because Metallica is one of the greatest rock bands EVER, and 4 or 5 years from now, their new album will come out, and I'll be writing another review on how awesome their new album is.ing, and the brilliant twin guitar attack of Hetfield and Hammett.

031606792X|5.0|I will be honest here. I am SO glad that I didn't read the reviews for this book beforehand otherwise, I would have been soured on this entire book. I finished this book today and I will be honest. I was not a Bella fan. I was not even an Edward fan. I adored Jacob even if he was immature. So I picked this book up with some apprehension since I have these feelings about these characters, but I was sucked into the story (pun is intended) and wanted to know how it ended.    Bella redeems herself and I really like Edward in this book and the whole storyline flowed perfectly ... everything fit together and yes, it was wrapped up nice and neat. I love the fact that Bella had a child with Edward and that Jacob was able to have his own future. Yes, I feel sorry for Rosalie who desperately wanted a child, but it all worked out for her as an aunt. The baby was obviously special and worth fighting for.     So pushing the issues such as teen pregnancy, not going to college, young marriages and unrealistic hopes aside ... this book is really a fun book. It is definitely the best of the series (thankfully) and it is better written than the other three books. Bella did do some growing up and once she realized that she was pregnant, she did what any mother would do, fight for her child, even if it cost her her life. Edward did what any man besotted by his young wife would do, save her life even if that means transforming her into a vampire. And no, I did not find Jacob's imprinting on the baby weird. So maybe the author took liberty in wrapping up the loose ends neatly and tied it in a lovely bow ... but that is her right to do so and I love happy endings because sometimes in real life, those happy endings don't always come true for people. That's why people read fiction ... to escape from the realities of their daily lives. Meyer did what she was supposed to do ... at least for me she did. She took me away to a different world and a different place and I was along for the ride. What a ride it was too!    So enjoy the book for what it's worth. It's fiction and maybe it's not the world's best fiction, but man, it really is a good story and I almost hate to say goodbye after reading this series this last month.     9/28/08
0307269752|4.0|Some people consider THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO to be the best mystery/thriller debut of 2008.  While I don't share that particular belief, I found the novel both enjoyable and absorbing.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is nothing groundbreaking.  Carl Blomkvist, a disgraced Swedish journalist, is hired by a wealthy industrialist to solve a 30-year old disappearance.  In order to solve the crime, he eventually teams up with Lisbeth Sander, a young, anti-social computer hacker.  Together, they eventually uncover a dark family web of secrets that may involve a serial killer.<br /><br />The real strength of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the characterization.  The late Stieg Larsson does a superb job of creating a set of vivid characters that achieve a level of depth and complexity that you rarely find in genre fiction.  In particular, the personality and background of Lisbeth Sander is quite unique and ultimately quite compelling to read about.<br /><br />I also very much enjoyed the setting of this book.  This novel is written by a Scandinavian author and almost entirely takes place in his native country of Sweden.  As an American who knows virtually nothing about Scandinavia, I found Larsson's descriptions of the Swedish government, business practices,  and societal norms to be quite fascinating.<br /><br />This novel, however, isn't for everyone.  Larsson is a wordy and descriptive writer, and this novel meanders around quite a bit in the middle, with multiple subplots (including a rather pointless romance) that really don't really drive the story forward.  Larsson also sometimes uses more detail than necessary, such as when he describes in excruciating depth how hackers can break into laptop computers.<br /><br />Further, the crime story ends rather prematurely, with Larson devoting his final sixty pages to resolving a subplot involving the main character's professional career that I didn't find particularly interesting.  While I found this book a page turner for the most part, my patience began to wear thin in spots, especially after I was two thirds of the way through.<br /><br />Overall, however, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a highly enjoyable read, and I think readers of quality crime fiction will find much to enjoy.  This is definitely one of the better debuts I've read this year, and I'm sad that Larsson passed away before completing this series.began to wear thin in spots, especially after I was two thirds of the way through.

0375826726|3.0|Both Eragon and Eldest were decent fantasy books that fleshed out the characters and universe they are set in. However, in Brisingr, it would seem that all of the detail and depth that Paolini has poured into the first two books characters are wasted.. The books attempts at character development outside of Saphira & Eragon are almost laughable to an expereincee reader of the Fantasy ganre'. There are many chapters and sections in the book that are simply unimportant to the overall plot or fail to seem significant in any way, leaving a feeling of \\"..so.. im supposed to care.. why?\\", or \\"..and the point of that was?...\\".        For all of Eragons' new training, the VAST majority of the book is spent in political bickering that is simply not interesting to read.. Yes, Eragon needs the backing and help of everyone who is not already sided with Galbatorix(spelling?), but he has sworn soo many oaths to soo many different leaders that he is nearly incapable of doing what he needs to accomplish his ultimate gaol.. His cousins revenge, his adoption into the Dwarven society, his service to Nasuada, his obligations to the elves & his Teacher, his own morals to what is \\"right\\" that endanger his entire cause, and finally, if he does not support or obey every other monarch in the land, it seems as if everyone will either lose faith in there cause and just go home...         While I understand and can appreciate the concept, it is both boring and frustrating to read to the extreme. To read a story about a young man with all the abilities that Eragon now has, to sit around and bicker with the books ultimatly unimportant characers for pages and pages is a waste of a book and a setting in my eyes. I'm by no means expecting the book to be about a Dragon Rider laying waste to armies here, but the unimportant political bickering is soo redundant and unimportant that you stop caring, your simply waiting to get to the part where something ELSE happens. The books battles seem to be thrownin just to keep your attention to the next moral dalemma or political arguement.. Overall the books is poorly written. I would have absolutly no problems reading everything the book has from cover to cover if it MENT something in the end of the book. But that is not the case. Instead you read through a 750 page book that could have been shortened down to about 300.. Soo many events that are drawn out and soo long that your original interest soon fades. The political bickering that takes up soo much space and ultimatly serves no overal purpose to the plot, and unimaginative characters or events being followed. That and having Roran's doings spliced inbatween whatever Eragon is doing is extremly annoying.     Upon reflecting on the entire series so far, Brisingr is the worst book by far. There are some very good and interesting developments in the book, but they are few and far between mountains of seemingly unimportant writing. While im not one to say comments like as this, it seems like Brisingr is a book that was written simply to set up the series finale, and to make an excuse to let Paolini publish another book. If you are a fan of the series, then go ahead and read the book, or find a summary of it somwhere online.. If you are not, then don't waste your time.

0375826726|1.0|I was so excited to enjoy the experience of reading this book, supposedly the final in a triology, and to find out how it all ends. I was extremely disappointed. The graphically violent description of self-mutilation not long into the story was sickening and entirely gratuitous. Even worse, I found almost the entire book painfully boring, entirely lacking any sort of plot. I only subjected myself to this boredom by convincing myself that I would have closure, as this was supposed to be the final book. Again I was disappointed as I approached the end and nothing was resolved. I reached the final chapter and discovered there was to be a fourth book. I am not hopeful the fourth will be worth the effort.
0143038419|4.0|I heard about this book being discussed on the Gail King XM radio show several months ago and was intrigued by the interview.  Having been through a divorce and walking through an airport on my weekly business travels, I purchased the book on a lark.   I found the book amazingly easy to read and quite enjoyable.  Liz Gilbert's ability to take you through her divorce and subsequent worldwide travel to only find her true inner-self was truly uplifting and entertaining.

0393327655|5.0|I wasn't sure that it would be worth my time to read the fourth recent book on atheism.    I'm glad I did.    The End of Faith adds many ideas and nuances to the conversation.  This is especially true in the last two chapters, which other reviewers have found controversial, rambling, or babble, but I found thought-provoking.   Harris acknowledges that there are not many answers.  However, just as the last 2000 years have seen astronomy develop from positing the earth being the center of the universe, rational experimentation and knowledge development can develop ethics and spiritualism into sound sciences.    Chapter 6 - A Science of Good and Evil - explores ethics from a starting point of zero faith.  After making a case against relativism and pragmatism, Harris explores several interesting ethical questions.  Like on abortion - Just because we can't determine exactly when humanity starts doesn't mean that you cannot make a moral judgement about a stem cell or a weeks-old fetus.   Or a thought-provoking question on tortue that challenges moral intuition - is it really worse to tortue a known criminal for information that would save lives than it is to drop bombs from the air on potentially innocent civilians?    Chapter 7 - Experiments in Consciousness - acknowledges the human desire for spiritualism/mysticism and starts to explore how to grow in those directions in a mindset that does not include faith.
076535618X|5.0|John Perry, the main character of the excellent _Old Man's War_, which kicks off this trilogy, has left the Colonial Defense Forces and is a colonial administrator (ombudsman) on a quiet farming colony with his wife, Jane Sagan (formerly of the Special Forces), and their adopted 13 year old daughter Zoe.  General Rybicki, a man from Perry's past, arrives with a proposal that he and Jane lead a new colony that is being planned.  After eight years of peaceful predictability, he's ready for a change.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new colony of Roanoke lives up to its namesake.  Things go bizarrely wrong from the start, with hidden conditions and plans imposed on them by the Colonial Union.  Hints about the way the Colonial Union controls information and has too much power over all of humanity point to problems that come to fruition in this book.  Intrigues and plots have placed John in the position of both fall-guy and possibly the only savior in a situation that could lead down the road to the failure of mankind in space.<br /><br />This book covers, briefly, life on an established colony, the planning and politics involved in a the colonization of a new world and the dangers from enemies in space (and betrayal by their own government) and natural hazards on the ground.  Then there are the tricky decisions and maneuvers in order to deal with the huge threat to the entire Colonial Union.<br /><br />These books can be read as stand-alones even though they have common characters, but why not start at the beginning, since they are all excellent books full of adventure and suspense?  This is a universe with exciting tales that one wish would never end.

B000ETDW16|5.0|I believe this movie to be well directed and scripted. It had the right amount of humor, drama, and \\"feel good\\" ending. They knew when to be funny and when to be serious. It had a great cast and overall it was a very enjoyable movie. From what I've read, this was one of those \\"hate it or love it\\" movies and I really liked the movie.     As for realism, yeah most of that stuff probably wouldn't fly realistically but if the only way to save our planet was to drill a hole in the sucker, would I prefer astronauts be given last minute instructions on how to drill or would I prefer some guy who has done it for years? I guess it sounds kinda funny/stupid at first but...I would prefer the experienced driller.     In any case, if realism is what you wanted, this isn't for you. If you want a to watch an entertaining movie, this is one of the best I've seen.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|No, the show does not follow the books that inspired it line for line. And yes, there is a lot of nudity---but it is on HBO and at night for goodness sakes! So far, 4 episodes in, I can say that the casting and music really do justice to Charlaine Harris's series of books about Sookie Stackhouse, a barmaid in small town LA, but Alan Ball has made the story his own as well. Check it out on demand or get the DVD when it comes out....Moyer is sexy as hell!
0312427999|1.0|Naomi Klein's latest book contains some fairly valid critiques of corporate welfare, crony capitalism, and other forms of government and corporations corrupting each other.  However, she then makes a bizarre attempt to link these to the ideals of free-market economists such as Milton Friedman.    As far as I can tell, the logic of her critique comes from mistakenly believing that Friedman was defending corporations out of loyalty to them, rather than because of abstract principles.  Therefore, any government action that benefits corporations must be part of Friedman's program and a fulfillment of his ideals.  Of course, as anyone who is even vaguely familiar with Friedman knows, he was just as critical of governments unfairly protecting and favoring corporations as he was of them attacking corporations.    Klein also ignores historical examples of crises that did not advance capitalism, such as WWI and the Great Depression.    It is too bad she chose to fixate on Milton Friedman, because otherwise this book might have been a decent critique of corruption and crony capitalism.

I give it a solid 4/5 as there is a bit of softness throughout the movie, but still looks great coming from the DVD version I've seen so much of.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I heard the plot outline and thought to myself this doesn't have the makings for a good movie. Why would a hit man choose a cabbie to drive him around? Why would this be interesting? But, I had similar thoughts before seeing \\"The Insider\\" - why would a movie about a corporate whistle blower be interesting. Now, \\"The Insider\\", along with \\"Heat\\", \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", and \\"Manhunter\\" are some of my favorite movies.  After seeing Collateral, I surprisingly really didn't have a problem with the issue of why a hit-man would have a cabbie drive him around from hit to hit. But, it didn't live up to other Michael Mann movies that I love. It seemed like a long version of an RHD episode.  If you want an entertaining movie, this will suffice. If you want Michael Mann at the top of his form, this isn't it.

B000002LAC|5.0|I love this album and for lots of reasons.  The most important one, though, is that the music is more than the sum of its parts.  I like Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris, but I'm not a huge fan of any of them either.  Each of them is limited in their own ways.  Their voices work incredibly well together, though!  Similarly, I don't think I would go out of my way to hear the collection of mostly older tunes on this album, but again, these three together remake them in ways that most artists doing cover tunes can only dream of.      That's not to say that every track is terrific.  There are a couple that I routinely skip (e.g., \\"Making Plans\\", and \\"Hobos Meditation\\".  On the other hand, there are several that I'll listen to over and over, even after hearing them for years.  The best known track is probably \\"To Know Him is to Love Him\\", which is superb, but the track I like best is \\"Telling Me Lies\\", which I'm listening to as I write this.  Linda Ronstadt's voice is in lead on that track and is incredibly powerful.  It's also a good illustration of how their voices work together.  At the end of the tune, Linda is initially singing alone, Emmylou finishes a phrase for her, then Dolly joins and the sound just transforms into the most wonderful blend of all three.      Priceless.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Not too many war movies can make you understand how brutal, exhausting, emotionally painful, draining, exciting, boring, glorious and ugly war is, but this is one of them.  The scenes of the march starting Pickett's charge alone will blow you away - I understand thousands of men were crying just reenacting it.  The combination of excitement and terror are caught so well at Little Round Top and Pickett's charge that you just can't stop watching.  For the acting - Jeff Daniels nails Joshua Chamberlain - scholar, soldier and brother - so well, I couldn't believe it was Jeff Daniels.  Richard Jordan as \\"Lo\\" Armistead - what can you say?  The man was an incredible actor his entire career, and this, his last performance, a doomed man playing a doomed man - I don't know how he found the inner strength to do it, but it's the best work he ever did.  And while I thought Martin Sheen was miscast at first, the more I watch his performance, the more subtleties I catch, the more I think this might have been his best work, too.  The best thing was that this film made me understand the Civil War and the battle of Gettysburg with an intimacy I never knew before.  It's like a million men from 1863 all looked me in the eye and said, \\"NOW do you understand?\\"  Well, not as well as you did, but a lot better than I did before.
0439806119|4.0|Scott Westerfeld's Uglies presents an intriguing view of a futuristic society; a society filled with such inventive devices as hoverboards, toothbrush pills, and interface rings.  In this society, beauty is thought to be of the highest value, and behavior is carefully controlled.  At the age of sixteen, residents of this city undergo an operation that transforms them from an \\"ugly\\" into a new \\"pretty.\\"  Children are taught to believe that there is only one type of beauty--the kind that is decided on and regulated by the government.  Thus, they all look forward to the day when they too can turn pretty and live a carefree life of frivolity.<br />Tally Youngblood is just such an ugly.  She is approaching her sixteenth birthday, and she can't wait.  Her best friend Peris has already turned pretty, and she is left alone as she awaits the day she will turn sixteen.  Enter Shay, another Ugly approaching the fateful sixteenth birthday.  Shay is a somewhat rebellious youth, who doesn't share the same views as Tally about the supposed joys of becoming pretty.  As they become friends, Shay begins to express her opinions about the city and the operation.  Shay feels that the operation is wrong; that people shouldn't be forced to all look the same.  She believes that people should be appreciated for who they are.  Tally can't quite comprehend Shay's point of view, but she doesn't think much about it until Shay declares her intention to run away to the Smoke, a small settlement outside of the cities where people choose to stay \\"ugly\\" rather than conform to the \\"ideal\\" standards of the city.  Shay invites Tally to join her, but Tally is unable to give up her life-long wish of becoming pretty, and chooses to stay.  However, on her sixteenth birthday, Tally is taken to Special Circumstances, an intimidating governmental force designed to keep the cities under control. Special Circumstances informs Tally that unless she follows Shay to the Smoke and reveals its location, she will be forced to remain ugly all her life. Although Tally feels terrible about the idea of betraying her friend, in the end she agrees to find the Smoke.  What follows for Tally is a daring journey, new friends, a new way of life which presents an alternate way of thinking, a disturbing discovery about the true nature of the operation, and a life-altering decision.<br /> I gave this book four stars out of five because I found it to be intriguing and thought-provoking, although it can't quite compare to the greatness of other dystopic novels such as The Giver, 1984, and Anthem.  However, it was a very enjoyable read.  I found it an interesting twist to have the concept of beauty being the main force behind the success of the society.  I think the message this book can send to readers is the danger of placing too much importance on physical appearance, and the value of having a society where everyone is unique.  What I really liked about this book was the way that Tally was able to grow and change throughout the novel.  In the beginning, I actually found her a bit annoying--she was so focused on how great it was going to be to be \\"pretty\\" that she couldn't see the sense in what Shay was telling her.  I liked Shay's character better at the start of the book, but as Tally grew and came to understand what it really meant to be \\"pretty,\\" and began to see that beauty could be found even in imperfect features, my respect for her grew.  In the end, she was really able to prove herself and show that she was willing to fight and to sacrifice for what she believed to be right, making her a character that I and other young adult readers can truly admire.  I think this is a great novel for young adults.  It was able to present intriguing ethical issues in a suspenseful plot.  It kept me interested, and was very well written.

0393061310|4.0|I was tempted to give Jared 5 stars based on the extent of his information and his strength of his argument.  I gave him only 4 stars because, although I think he is 75% correct, I think he has ignored or denies factors that may be important.<br /><br />Early in his book, Kali, an intelligent New Guinean and would-be shaker and mover asks a significant question.  \\"Why does the white man have more cargo [goods, stuff, useful things] than we do?  Jared, correctly in my opinion, refutes the politically incorrect view that New Guineans must be less intelligent than whites.  Quite the contrary, Jared asserts.  New Guineans, on the average, are more intelligent than whites.<br /><br />A little like Jared, I've had the opportunity to live with 'primitive' people and have seen their superiority to me in things like bushcraft, tracking, spacial orientation and other things....yet.... they are not necessarily more intelligent than I am.  Their experience is simply different than mine.  I agree, however, that they are, on the average, intelligent people dealing with problems somewhat different those of 'civilized' individuals.<br /><br />Jared attributes the dominance of Western Man over almost all other peoples of the earth because of our geographical location and because of the fortuitous presence of large wild animals that had the potential for domestication i.e. animals like the auroch, wild horse, ibex, wild sheep etc.  In the Americas, for instance--despite the fact that the meso-Americans and Andean peoples may have been superior to Western peoples in terms of agriculture--the only domesticatable wild animal available to them may have been the guanaco and vicuna.  Therefore, native-americans were obliged to carry things themselves.  Hence Cortes conquered Mexico, rather than Montezuma conquering Spain.<br /><br />BUT....and it's a big 'BUT'....We know, from toys discovered that the ancient Americans understood the wheel.  Why then didn't they discover the wheel-barrow propelled by a single person?  It multiplies human labor by a factor of 3.  It would have made the construction of monuments and almost everything else, a lot easier.  Why didn't they make the connection or, if they did, why didn't they carry it to the next logical level and actually use it.  I don't know but I rather suspect that the wheel WASN'T used initially in a cart propelled by large domestic animals.  Even in Mesopotamia and China, it was likely used by the first and most available 'domestic' animal...that is the human being.  Why did the people's of the Old World come up with the idea and those of the New World didn't.  For that matter, why didn't Diamond discuss it.<br /><br />Yes, cattle, sheep, goats and a myriad of other creatures were available to the peoples of the entire 'old world.'  Despite this, Europeans and Middle Easterners made the most effective use of them.  Why?<br /><br />Indeed, why?  Let me postulate another couple of scenario.  Let us imagine, that human societies spread over the earth are like the atmosphere spread over the earth.  Why a storm in one place and not another?  Perhaps a very minor, almost imperceptible perturbation, causes major changes down the line.  A slight shift in atmospheric pressure over China and there's a devastating hurricane in Louisiana...a slight cultural perturbation, perhaps in now Albania, and Pizarro burns Atahualpa at the stake?  Maybe the 'superiority' of Western culture is no more than a happenstance.<br /><br />Also, although now largely discredited, who really knows if there are differences in the way that different brains work?  This is not to say that certain brains are necessarily 'better' than others but that they might be different.  Also, who is to say that industrialized, 'civilized' society is better than hunter gatherer societies?  In many ways, it isn't.  Civilized society is ulcerogenic.  Hunter-gatherer societies are probably more satisfying and fun.  Genesis, in the Bible, talks of man being thrown out of Paradise and having to work by the sweat of his brow.  This is almost certainly an allegory about the replacement of enjoyable and care-free hunter-gatherer existence as opposed to the drudgery of early civilization.<br /><br />Why is domination a function of a pressure wave produced by black powder in a pipe propelling a leaden slug? Luck?<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexicoeat of his brow.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|Outstanding movie!  I never get tired of watching it.  I've purchased it for myself and as a gift to friends.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|A movie stuntman (Lee Pace from \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day\\") in early 1920's Los Angeles is laid-up from a serious fall and is suicidal.  An inquisitive little girl (amazingly cute Catinca Untaru) begins asking him questions and before anyone realizes it, he begins to tell her fanciful stories.  Director Tarsem Singh channels Spielberg with his amazing and enormously grand cinematography.  The loosely told love story with wild adventurers, heroes and princesses is shown in colorfully large scale in dramatic places.  From crystal clear waters of an ocean reef to sand deserts and the Taj Mahal, the look is nothing short of mesmerizing (ever seen an elephant swim in a lush reef filmed from underneath?)  The despondent stuntman tells the story in hopes of getting the young girl to procure him a bottle of lethal morphine.  In the process, his story grows and progresses into wild and visually arresting backdrops.  Costumes and characters are played out in over twenty countries with no CGI effects - all the visuals were done with thousands of extras and enormous outdoor sets.  The story of the stuntman and the little girl takes on its own life and the two intertwine with dramatic and endearing results.  The ending is rich, clever and more than satisfying.  This is a film that has to be seen to be believed.  They just don't make them like this anymore.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man is one of the best damn movies to come out this year. I was very pleased that they stayed so closely with character and also glad that Tom Cruise did not get the part. Reason being that Robert Downey Jr. was selected for the part was that in his life he had alcohol and substance abuse and character Tony Stark had basically the same thing. He brought this remarkable character to life and I can't wait for the sequel in two years. In this movie you will find all that you want to find in a movie, action, adventure, drama, romance, and comedy. This movie is definitely going to be a keeper in my books, but in overall to everybody, get this movie!
0618164413|4.0|obviously great stories and so many of them. however, i think it's more fun for a little person to be able to go through multiple books versus one cmbersome edition. but a great value in hard cover
B000W4D94I|3.0|I purchased the blu-ray disk to replace the standard DVD that I've owned for years because the SD version is awful, videowise.  This blu-ray transfer is good, though I would not call it great.    If you are a fan of this movie, it is worth replacing if you own the SD version.
0740748475|5.0|really enjoyed reading it and was nice to see the complete c&h all in one box set. I've always been a big fan. i like how its printed- almost looks like the strips are stuck on. the only complaints i have is that its too bulky and there are no finger holes in the box to pull the individual books out. nevertheless, i highly recommend it for anyone who has, over the years, enjoyed c&h- its brilliant!
B000002VCT|5.0|With their other hit LP's, \\"Pyramid\\" wasn't as popular, but it was right up there! Whether your enjoying a little herb or a wine cooler, this was a LP that could carry you away among the clouds!
B000NA2BEU|1.0|not only was the last disc cracked, but the third and fourth disc were missing!! someone went to to alot of trouble to make this disc set look new in a sealed package, what a scam!!
0375826726|3.0|It's a well written book, but the plot does not thicken enough throughout the story to well include it in a separate book.  I can only think of three significant events and maybe three significant nuggets of information that come from the book.  The author should have included this book in his final one and called it good.
0375826726|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but thought that it was the last in the series. So, imagine my surprise when it didn't really end after 763 some pages! I seem to be the only one not connected to CP's websites or others that noted this would be a four series set of books.<br /><br />Overall, I think CP's writing is getting better w/ each book. I can't wait for the fourth book and I know my daughter will be pleased that I finished this, so that she can get her hands on it.
159562015X|5.0|We are a strength based organization and basically had all of our staff read this book and take the online test.  THe results were so accurate in describing each individual and, as well, in explaining why each person was excelling in their work, that we have started a policy of having new employees, in the interview process, read the book and take the test.  No, it is not a fortune teller.  Rather, it shows tendencies and areas where a person can see the world from the power rather than as an observer...  Yea! Great book!!
B001EC9V58|5.0|If you don't own a region-free DVD, do what I did and get one here at Amazon thru it's various marketers.  I got a JVC that is both region free and converts PAL to NTSC - and it was cheap.  That said, this is the type of film that made my purchase of a region-free player, worthwhile.  With the pending release of the american \\"version\\" of this film (and those who prefer the asian version of Grudge, The Eye...etc know what I mean)I was not overly hopeful this would come to us in our local version.  So I bought the import and have been VERY happy with the film.  just think 28 DAYS.........after drinking a whole case of RedBull.
B00062IVKS|1.0|I'm a boxing fan and train often but I have no idea why people like this movie. It's a story about a cocky, arrogant jerk who likes to abuse the people around him both mentally and physically. Most of the movie is of him degrading women, screaming profanities to them and hitting them. In one scene he beats his own brother badly in a jealous rage, stomping him and then slugs his own 20 year old wife.  The only thing I learned from this movie is that Jake Lamotta was one horrible person.  This movie does nothing for boxing. It basically just shows boxers as violent wife beaters who can take punches. Even the fight scenes do nothing to showcase the art of boxing.
B001DDBCV4|1.0|I have a Samsung Blu-ray DVD player that is less than 3 months old. This movie will not play on it. All I get is the black screen.   My other movies play fine, so I rented a copy of this movie to see if the defect was in the one I bought. It's not,it appears  an incompatability issue between this film and my player. I notice that someone who bought the non-Blu Ray version of this movie had the same problem.  I wasted my money.
0374264260|5.0|This book was a lot of fun to read.  I also could not put it down and finished it in two days.  You will especially like it if you grew up in the Northeast US as this is the setting for the story.  Buy it and enjoy it!
B00008PC2O|4.0|These idiots who purchase these movies on BluRay and then give the movie a poor rating because of the transfer should go ahead and keep buying the older movies both on DVD and BluRay, or better yet, just mail me your money.  You cannot go back and re-shoot an entire movie in a HD format. So thus, you cannot make it an HD movie just like that.  Now the features on the other hand, is something that can be surpassed from the DVD releases and is multiple times not done.  I just get sick of hearing the same old tearing down and poor ratings of a movie all because of the retarded expectations of people thinking a movie should be magically re-done in HD when that is not going to happen.  Just purchase new releases for the BlueRay and buy older movies in DVD and save your money!
B001DZLAWI|5.0|I will keep this review short as so many people have left great reviews (and some bad) for this album. This Is One of the Greatest ALBUMS OF ALL TIME!!!!! I know that people compare this album to their early stuff: Master Of Puppets and The Black Album. But it's better than that and I think It's up there with Zepplin Four and AD/DC's Back In Black!!! THe Best album of Metallica Has Ever Made. One Of The Best Hard Rock Of All Time!!!!     nuff said..............
B001794FOK|1.0|What a great idea for a film but the story did not just fall through it fell all the way to China. Watching this movie made you want to go see the dentist as that would be a better story with a good ending.    If you have two hours to kill watch the Muppets in Space, it was better Sci-fi then this.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls! I became addicted soon after watching the first few episodes! I now own all seven seasons!!
B000001FQQ|4.0|H.I.T.S. is a refreshing change from the copy-cat 80's metal of Animalize-Crazy Nights, full of great riffs and cinematic lyrics.<br /><br />This is probably my most listened to KISS album as it was constantly in my Walkman from 1996-1998, when I was being introduced to the world of KISS and always kept me entertained.<br /><br />The best part about the album is the stories of the songs themselves, that get you very involved.  Songs like \\"Hide Your Heart\\", \\"Cadillac Dreams\\" and the forgotten \\"King of Hearts\\" are very visual in their lyrical descriptions and musical tone.<br /><br />Of course \\"Forever\\" is a classic and \\"Rise To It\\" pulls no punches in its direct rock n' roll riffs.<br /><br />Personal favorites include: \\"Silver Spoon\\", \\"King of Hearts\\" and \\"Betrayed\\".<br /><br />My only criticism of the album is that KISS seems to have gotten lazy on writing lyrics for 15 songs so they added a lot of \\"Na-Na-Na's\\" \\"Hey-Hey's\\" and \\"Doo-Doo-Doo's\\".<br /><br />Overall the album is fun, rock music that doesn't take itself too seriously and embody's the party-hearty spirit KISS is known for.
B00003CXV4|4.0|This is one of those incurable disease flicks designed to make you cry. I didn't, but then again, maybe it wasn't as effective as it could have been. It reminded me of a remake of \\"Love Story,\\" the '60s film. Actually, it fooled me for the first two thirds. I didn't see the disease angle coming. It's a chick flick, no doubt. But guys will like it up to a point.
B000JIHP88|4.0|My four month old does enjoy watching this mobile in her crib and it will quietly entertain her and sometimes even put her to sleep.  The music is not very loud, but since it's soothing that seems ok to me.  We used rechargeable batteries with it and they did seem to run down quickly, but they always run down faster than regular batteries.  It was easy to install on the crib and seems stable.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have watched Masterpiece theater for more than twenty five years and just about all of the BBC productions but I missed the North and South.I am very glad that I found this DVD, it is outstanding.
031606792X|5.0|I am sick of all the complaining. People don't know how to read a good book and appreciate it anymore.    SPOILER - sorry but I have to say this    I don't believe that some of these reviews even mention things like \\"wrong messages\\" or \\"all your problems will be solved\\". That is just ridiculous and untrue. If you base your life's solutions and predicaments on a fantasy book, you need to get a life. A book is nothing more than an excellent way to entertain your mind. Meyer did an excellent job at that. All three books were ever so captivating and entertaining.     Bella's happy ending was not at all wrong or even contrary to our philosophies of life. Her \\"life\\" as an immortal had terminated, she had \\"died\\" and therefore deserved all the best of life because she had lived a harsh life. Being torn when Edward left, and torn because of what she felt for Jacob she was more than entitled to her happy ending.     I am a huge fan of happy endings and it made me so happy to see that everything worked out. She got everything she wanted and that's okay with me. I will not go out there and start thinking that my life will go as I please because Bella's life worked out that way for her, that's is ridiculous and childish. I see my life in my own perspective and I don't take advice from fantasy books. If you think you have problems with that, you should speak to someone mature to help you face problems in life.    And please, stop talking about Jacob and pedophile! That is ridiculous, Jacob loved her (Renesmee) as a friend, while she was a baby his love for her was as that of a father, a caring protector. So what he loved Bella at one point? Wasn't it about time he stopped, she was married to Edward. I'm glad Meyer found someone for him.     I think Meyer did an excellent job at portraying a fairy tale happy ending. Which satisfied me and many of the friends I have spoken to about the book. It was 100% amazing!  And like my title says, if you do not agree you could not be more wrong.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I looooooove Friends!!!  And the price for this box set is a STEAL!  This will keep you entertained for hours when there is nothing on tv.  I love the cast and the writing for this show and this DVD collection includes some episodes that have writer commentary (SO interesting!)  Since I am a big fan of the show I enjoy watching the dvds in order and remembering exactly how and when everything happened.  This is an absolute must have for any fan of the show!<br /><br />The box set includes 40 DVDs which are divided into 6 groups.  Each group is kept in a pouch that contains 6-8 dvds.  All the dvds and the pouch for each group are decorated with photos of one of the main characters (hence why there are 6).  Everything is stored in a nice box!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Though Reveal had some lovely moments, this is the first       example of REM sounding like a \\"complete\\" band since Bill Berrys retirement. Power and passion!!! Awesome!!!
B000UBONPW|5.0|If you love the blues then these recordings are a must have.  The pairing of the legendary Albert King with the blues virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan was a match made in heaven.  Stevie absolutely idolized Albert and it comes through on these tracks as does the respect that Albert King had for his student.  When Albert asks Stevie to play his song Pride and Joy you can sense the pride and joy it was to perform at the bequest of his mentor.  These electrifying performance brought a tear of joy to my eyes.  On the Pep Talk track Albert gives Stevie sage advice and prophecies the future.  The Blues at Sunrise track is Bluesology 101 in of itself.  I only wish I could have been a fly on the wall at these sessions.<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this album is that it's too short.  Until you buy or download this CD you and your blues collection are incomplete.
B000YENUI6|5.0|This 2007 British import is one of the bloodiest and violent films I have ever seen.  It's about the Russian mafia in London and there are scenes in this film that makes The Godfather seem like a nursery story.  Perhaps it's because there is less censorship nowadays but whatever it is, the film feels real, the plot fast and easy to follow and the acting superb.<br /><br />Set in London, Naomi Watts is cast as a nurse in a maternity war who has problems of her own.  She's English born but she lives with her mother and Uncle, both of whom are Russian &eacute;migr&eacute;s.  When a teenage girl in her care gives birth and then dies, she has deep feelings for the baby.  She therefore sets out to uncover the mystery of the teenager who has left a diary in the Russian language, which she, herself, cannot read.  She asks her uncle to translate it and when he refuses she goes to an older Russian man who owns an upscale Russian restaurant and who seems to be grandfatherly to everyone around them.<br /><br />While this is going on, the audience sees some vile murders, and one grizzly scene where Viggo Mortenson, cast as a Russian chauffeur, has to dispose of a body.  He works for the older Russian man and his wild and crazy son played by Vincent Cassel.  Violence is everywhere.  Young girls are brought from Russia and forced into brothels.  There is greed, deception and horrific murders.<br /><br />Naomi Watts starts to uncover the truth, and Viggo Mortenson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for this role, starts to befriend her.  There is a stoic cold blooded calmness about him that is quite unnerving.  Then, he is central to one scene in a Russian bathhouse which is the most violent I have ever seen.<br /><br />How this all plays makes for really good drama.  I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.  Then, by the end of the film, all the loose ends are tied up in satisfactory way that makes sense.  Good filmmaking.<br /><br />Recommended, especially for those who are not afraid of nonstop action and violence.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I have enjoyed this CD for quite some time but admit I'm even more impressed now that I caught her performing live on the 09/27/2008 episode of Saturday Night Live.  She perfomred \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Stepping Stone\\" and she was great.  The best live performer they've had on in a while.  Looking forward to hearing whatever she does next too.  I'm enjoying the retro vibe she and Adele and Joss Stone have brought back around.  \\"Stepping Stone\\" is my favorite and reminds me of those Petula Clark and Dionne Warwick albums my Mom & Dad used to play.  Very nice.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Dexter - Season 2 is awesome!<br /><br />If you watched Sea. 1 and loved it, grab Season 2 ASAP! Its that good.<br /><br />The 1st episode in Sea. 2 sucks in you and it never lets up throughout the entire season.<br /><br />Sgt. Doakes is relentless in his pursuit to bring Dexter down in Season 2, a new serial killer the Bay Harbor Butcher is on the loose in Miami, which brings the FBI to town and making things for Dexter that much more difficult!<br /><br />A new female character is brought into Season 2, Lila! Wow is all I can say, her character is awesome, she takes the show to a new level!<br /><br />I finished the entire season in a few days!<br /><br />Cant wait for Season 3!<br /><br />Dexter rocks!

B00005JLXE|3.0|That title is not a question; it's a statement, because I'm going to tell you what I think ruined this movie.  It wasn't Ben Affleck.  As far as well-known actors go, he performed quite well in a niche role.  It wasn't Michael Clarke Duncan.  Even thought the Kingpin is white in every other version, what big white guy are you going to get to play the role as well as Duncan did?  Turning a white character black is not a concern for me; they're doing it with Nick Fury for the Ultimate Avengers, and it works.<br /><br />No, the problem with this film is two-fold: Jennifer Garner and Colin Farrell.  Or maybe it should be Jennifer Garner and Mark Stephen Johnson.  Well, whoever's responsible for the crap-tastic versions of Elektra and Bullseye, they're responsible for the lameness of \\"Daredevil.\\"<br /><br />Jennifer Garner is just not a good actress.  She looks nice, but that's it.  Her portrayal of Elektra was such a deviation from the original character; she's too outgoing, too nice, too kind-hearted.  She's Greek, but she can't even speak to her father in their native language, even when he speaks it to her?  She also talks too much.  And couldn't they have at least dyed her hair black?  This is like making Jean Grey a blonde; you don't do it.<br /><br />Maybe Colin Farrell isn't to blame for Bullseye's failure; maybe he was just doing as directed.  Either way, he took an already cinematic character from the comics and made him so incredibly generic.  Bullseye's cocky and talkative; Farrell was soft-spoken and had an accent (Don't try to tell me he can't fake an American accent.  \\"Phone Booth\\").  I understand that the comic book version of Bullseye wore a silly spandex outfit that wouldn't look good on film, but couldn't they have done better than a trench coat?  Go play \\"The Punisher\\" video game that came out in 2005 to see a perfect representation of Bullseye that would have worked for the film.  To bad Garth Ennis didn't work on this film.<br /><br />I'm interested in seeing Director's Cut, but I see no way it will change my opinion on the failings of these two characters.  Maybe I'll just skip around their scenes.see no way it will change my opinion on the failings of these two characters.  Maybe I'll just skip around their scenes.
1569242739|5.0|Even if you aren't vegan, do yourself a favor and give this cookbook a try!  Wonderfully innovative and delicious recipies, easy to follow instructions and great ingredient suggestions make this gem of a book suitable for anyone on any budget.  I made the mocha version of the chocolate cupcake and it was so freaking great I just had to rush to the computer and write a review.  Seriously.  Even if you have never baked anything in your life, the authors offer trouble shooting tips and explanations of ingredients for those who need a little extra help.    You won't have buyer's remorse, but you may feel a little guilty after eating a way too many cupcakes...

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm only in the first of the three levels of this video and it's such a terrific workout for only being 22 minutes long. I really feel as if I've accomplished something when I'm finished. It's only been a week and I'm already noticing positive changes in my body. I love to work out hard and I know this video will keep pushing me to the next level. I'm so glad I found this video!!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Yessir, it has been exactly 20 years, but it's been worth the wait for Metallica's fifth METAL album: 2008's DEATH MAGNETIC IS IT! Yes, the Black Album had some very good songs on it, but that was not A++ Metallica METAL on par with their first four albums. And what of what came after the Black Album? Hey, if I want to listen to the theme from Smokey and the Bandit, I'll listen to it. I don't want to hear Hetfield's versions of it!!<br /><br />To me, a list of absolutely essential A++ Metallica songs include: the entire first 4 albums, a couple/few songs from the Black Album, and these tracks from the new puppy:<br /><br />That Was Just Your Life, The End Of The Line, The Day That Never Comes, All Nightmare Long, Suicide & Redemption.<br /><br />The rest of the album is strong, but I swear it's these 5 tracks that are absolutely 100% on par with Metallica's prime 1983-1988 work. That is saying something, friend. After all, it's been 20 years of drift for these heroes of ours.<br /><br />Note: The last 4 minutes of The Day That Never Comes, in particular, is absolutely astonishing.
6305428352|5.0|Mr. Holland's Opus is a great movie.  I have watched it several times and I will keep watching it.  It has so much meaning and caring and Richard  Dreyfuss did a great job.
6305076995|5.0|I am an old white guy who graduated from high school in 1972 and who was utterly enthralled with what is called \\"progressive rock\\" for a decade of my young life. At the top of a heap that included bands like Gentle Giant, Caravan, and Emerson Lake & Palmer stood Yes. It's hard to describe what they meant to me. The first record for me was the \\"Yes Album,\\" and it literally changed my perspective on music. I saw the band for the first of my 23 shows over a period of more than 25 years at a Catholic high school outside of Cleveland on a Sunday afternoon. It was between the release of the \\"Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" - they were debuting songs from that record at the show. I saw the tour captured on this DVD three times.    Many other reviewers have pointed out the fairly poor sound quality and the unrestored nature of the film, but toss all of that out. Toss too whether they played \\"Roundabout\\" as well as the studio version, or any other detail about a particular song. None of that matters. What matters is that this is the REAL DEAL - this is what Yes was like when they ruled the progressive world like no other.    The energy level is amazing. Steve Howe and Chris Squire are on fire. Jon sings like an angel. Wakeman doesn't miss a note. And a very young Alan White plays with a joy that you won't see very often.    I'd give a particular nod to Steve Howe. This isn't the distinguished old fellow you see on newer Yes DVDS (that's not a knock - we all get old); this is a fellow in his mid-twenties who is perhaps even fueled with some substances... but is playing with manic excellence.    If you came to Yes late (and most of you reading this are probably younger than I am), and you want to see a performance that combines intense discipline with pure joy, BUY THIS TODAY. It is a peak into the distant past that will blow your mind.    Progressive rock will never be better than this. Yes is the Beatles of the genre.
B000AAWMS8|4.0|I loved the dvd.  I could watch Michael Flately for hours.  Infact I have several of the dvd's
B000092T6M|5.0|Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is probably one of the finest epics of its time. Too bad the original DVD release did not do the film justice. Put simply the original DVD sucks! The big issue is that its a flipper and that you had to flip the disc to watch the second half of the movie which is retarded, but mind you that the DVD did come out in 1997 and that the film's time limit was near 2 1/2 hours. Thankfully Warner Bros. came back and remastered this film in a brand new edition. The great news is that the whole movie is on one disc and that YOU DON'T NEED TO FLIP IT! THANK GOD! You can sit and watch a 2 1/2 hour flick all the way through with no changing or flipping discs! YES! What's new is extra footage put into the film which is not all enlightening but who cares? The second disc does not offer a whole lot but at least there is behind the scenes look and the Bryan Adams music video and the entire film's music score by the late Michael Kamen. Overall the movie is worth the watch and is probably Kevin Costner's last great film before his downside in movies. It is a long movie (the extended version is about 155 minutes) but I enjoy long movies. Think about it. It's worth the price in theaters nowadays. You pay 9 bucks just to see a 90-minute picture? Give me a break!!! I would rather pay 9 bucks just to see a 2 1/2 to 3 hour picture so it will be worth it. Not including the snacks and drinks I probably would be forced to buy as well. But anyway Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is an amazing film and this 2-disc edition is a must-have for anyone who enjoys this movie as much as I did. I recommend this film in anyone's collection and it is at a very cheap price too. SWEET!
B00005LK95|4.0|Buy both 1 and 2.  I enjoyed these movies so much for the second time around on dvd.  They are so much fun to watch and brings me back to when I was a kid first watching these movies.  Number 5 is awesome!
B000J5XS3C|1.0|Mine came broken, straight out of the box. I needed this for a live gig. I use a lot of Behringer stuff because it is low-cost, but very quiet and reliable stuff.<br /><br />Lately though, I've been having bad luck with Behringer. I bought a mulitple headphone rackmount unit and it was humming and buzzing. I looked online and many others were complaining about it. I exchanged it for another and it did the same thing right out of the box so I took it back and got the 4-channel version and it too had a buzz in it. Then I got this unit from Amazon and it came dead. The unit would light up, but that was it. Dead.<br /><br />Amazon was cool about refunding my money, so that's cool, but this unit being broken straight out of the box caused me a lot of grief as I received this unit the day before the gig and didn't find out it was broken until it came time to use it, LIVE! Luckily I had a backup... Also a behringer of the same size, that I've had for about 7 years now and it's been great. Go figure.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope Behringer isn't going down the tubes. I've not happy with the last four Behringer products I purchased. I might be done with them now.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Point Break is a really unique action film and it stands the test of time.  The dialogue is so-so but holds your interst until the end with the final skydiving scenes.  In this adrenaline edition, you get a nice set of extras and for a really low price.  This movie had one of my favorite bank robbery scenes and I highly recommend it to anyone for the value of this dvd.
0394401557|5.0|[[ASIN:0394401557 Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume One]]My book group read \\"Julie & Julia\\" this month and I purchased Julia Child's book to compare.  I thorougly enjoyed looking for Julia's recipes that Julie prepared over her year of cooking.  I actually made three of Julia's recipes to share with my book group.  We had a great time!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|My personal favorite of the two Short Circuit movies.  Steve Guttenberg! Number 5!  More input!  Classic 80's cheese right here.  And don't forget the guy who played the Captain in Police Academy as a bad military officer.  I highly suggest this movie, and I believe the Blu-Ray versaion is less than $10 on Amazon.  Go get it!
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|There is a lot of clutter around this band that effects what people think about them. Their on-stage appearance, side projects, musical evolution, and increasing mainstream exposure (is the band more mainstream or is the mainstream more accepting?) create a lot of static that makes it hard to see this band clearly. They are nine, slightly nihilistic, men in their mid to late thirties that have stayed together 10 years and managed to survive the backlash against late 90's nu-metal.    All hope is gone is Slipknot's fourth album in 10 years, which indicates that a lot of effort goes into each album. It also means that each release isn't a slow subtle change for the listener, but more of a jarring quantum leap. With each new release, I have to listen to it all the way through a few times before I can render judgment. My first reaction to All Hope is Gone, was the same as it was to Vol 3., \\"what the hell is this?\\" Thats because I had been listening to Vol 3 for five years and was expecting more of that; which would be suicide for the band.  In the scope of Slipknot's other release, this album is good, but not on the same level as Slipknot or Vol 3., more on the \\"It's ok\\" level (in my opinion) as Iowa.     Highs:  1. Some pretty good songs like Gematria, Sulfur, Psychosocial, Vendetta (like the riff, hate the lyrics), All Hope is Gone, and 'Til we die.  2. Great production and better mix for the drums and bass. With a band this big its hard to get the mix right without squashing something.  3. Each album shows increasing maturity and technical skill.  4. I liked the Special Edition's DVD bonus features.    Lows:  1. Gehenna. Ok riff, poor vocal performance. Corey or the producers made some decisions that just weren't good.  2. Another Vermillion track? Totally uncalled for and redundant.  3. This album feels A LOT like it's a five piece band not a nine piece. The samples and DJ keep getting pushed out of the mix and I can't here any parts where the two percussionists really stand out. My feeling is that best balance of all these elements was on the first album.  4. I know a lot of people have said this, and though it pains me to agree, I have to say that there is a lot of straight ahead, Stone Sour, sounding stuff here. Being a side project, that kind of comparison is going to be easy, so I think they should work harder to avoid the gravity of influence that radio friendly rock is going to have on them. I still like the grove oriented, rhythm-centric style of late 90's nu-metal and would like to see that combined with Slipknot's penchant for death metal; to me that's what separated them from the pack in the first place.     Bottom Line: Good album. I bought it and don't regret it. I don't think it will make any new Slipknot fans though.
0307394549|4.0|I really like the lay out of the book.  The opening pages have pictures of all the cookies, and they are beautiful.  I am undergoing a project to bake a different recipe each week and blog about it. [...]<br /><br />I wish it were a hard cover, or spiral bound to stay open better while cooking.  Mine is getting all bent up.  So far, great recipes, and BEAUTIFUL book.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This wonderful Masterpiece Theater version sent me back to read the book again for what is now the third time. I had forgotten the book through the years and only at the last minute decided to watch this new filmed version of the book when the 2006 production was being rebroadcast on PBS this past May.  I was so enthralled and quickly purchased the Special Edition with the added commentary, deleted scenes, etc. (but, unfortunately no subtitles that I could find).  The fact that this version's screenplay was written by a woman and was also directed by a woman I think contributes to this more sensual version which I truly enjoyed and appreciated.  Jane Eyre remains one of literature's most interesting female characters with her independence and desire for more out of life than what is being offered to penniless young girls of the 1800's.  Her belief that whatever fulfillment she can achieve out of life can be obtained by other means than by simply finding some man to marry and support her sets the stage for compelling story-telling. Her youthful spirit and kind nature and honesty captures the heart of the having-lived-too-hard Mr. Rochester. I honestly cannot get enough of this delightful version of this wonderful story.  I particularly liked the not-in-the-book ending as it shows us yet again another example of Jane's kindness and generous spirit, and I do find myself with a smile on my face at the end and wanting to experience this production again and again.  Well done, cast and crew!!
B0017XOF5A|5.0|Continuum has several different messages and lessons incorporated into the regular plot and may just save the Atlantis spinoff. Loved the fact that they knew it was going to be on Blu-Ray so they inserted some splendid non Vancouver shots. I am totally biased as I have all Stargates from the Original movie to all episodes of both series and the direct to DVDs. I was a huge Farscape fan (have all of their DVDs), so when we went to Stargate SG1 to Stargate SG1.3 I accepted the \\"Bump\\" and was sorry to see it wind down.  My only problem with both the regular and Blu-Ray DVDs was that Amazon gave me tracking numbers for both products, (which were pre-ordered), and the Postman had nothing to deliver for a month or so-both were in transit. I hope this means that MGM made a tidy profit and more will follow.  And while some may say that we are watching repackaged Soaps, my middle child has decided to get his PHD in Physics, so good Science Fiction may have beneficial side effects.  Buy it with confidence as $20 is a fair price.
0137549202|4.0|This book is widely accepted as the standard graduate level text for Discrete Time Signal Processing. Personally I think it could use a bit of elaboration and the figures and graphs should be improved upon.<br /><br />I must say that for the most part it is comprehensive and thorough in dealing with this subject matter. Some of the trickier nuances are lost in this treatment of the subject.<br /><br />I would highly advise this book to anyone who has a firm and solid foundation in subjects such as DSP, communications and possibly transform mathmatics. I would not under any circumstance advise this book as a starting point!<br /><br />Additionally, due to the nature and level of this material... I would suggest a study guide to accompany. Having been out of school for only four years I entered an online masters program... I am expected to teach myself from the book, I have found the study guide to be necessary.

0893860220|4.0|This is indeed a spiritual classic that I have found incredibly engaging, as well as enlightening. The patient eloquence of Sri Nisargadatta when occasionally confronted with the frustrated and confused ignorance of the interviewer's questions is quite humorous - often like a parent talking to a child.    The one thing that disappoints me is the quality of the printing - at least with my copy. On most pages it is so bad that some words are missing letters, or part of a letter and much of the printed text is so light that it appears the printing press was low on ink. It's not so bad that it's unreadable, just somewhat annoying. Perhaps this is the exception and not the rule. It's just a shame that one of my favorite books has such poor quality printing. Hence the 4 stars.

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn reads like a badly edited first draft, without regard to reason and with obvious intent to insult the reader's intelligence.    I wasn't bothered by how easy Bella had it as a vampire (because being a perfect vampire might explain why she made a boring human), or that her gift was a shield (because that fits her personality), or that she got pregnant (because, then she's dying and HAS to be a vampire instead of Edward just randomly biting her - I get that, even if the pregnacy itself is a huge stretch!)...or EVEN that Jacob imprinted on a baby (because it's weird, but so is a vampire/human relationship)!  But to ask me to suspend my disbelief and accept ALL that...and THEN make Bella sex crazed, take 1/3rd of the book to cover a few days and add WAY too much side story, make the object of the imprinting Bella's own baby, allow her to maintain a relationship with Charlie, and then end the book with the Volturi returning but running away?!?!?!  Sorry, but that's stretching the concept of \\"suspension of disbelief\\" to the point of madness.  A little more time and effort and this book could have had a happy ending that was worth reading.    If you've read the first three books, you might as well finish reading the series...but do yourself a favor and borrow the book instead of paying good money to be tortured like this.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Fantastic work. Classic organic rock. Melody, hooks and tons of drive. A worthy effort gentlemen.
B000000HU0|5.0|Gong's Shamal is where we find this band taking their abundant musical ability seriously. More tightly focused than their previous efforts (although 'You', the album that preceded this one, is by far the brilliant best of their early period), Shamal has a vigorous jazz-rock-funk groove that sits comfortably in its European surroundings. Instead of a tedious electric guitar spoiling the bands fantastic drive, much of the lead is taken up by wind instrumentalist extraordinaire 'Bloomdido', who treats us to flute (bamboo and modern), soprano and tenor saxes; and although electric guitar is on the menu, its in capable hands and not over used.The humorous, forever young lyrics are shaded with a subtle tint of worldliness that saves them from being completely naïve.     This is wonderfully creative music where wind instruments, xylophones, gongs, a violin, electric guitar, bass, drums and percussion explore anything from the wind blown deserts of central Asia to Bohemian café enchantment.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|I first saw these movies years ago when they first came out and at that time I didn't think much of them.  My son is a fan, so I bought the HD DVD box set for him as a gift and I have to say, this time around I was mightily impressed. The special effects and the True HD soundtrack are brilliant, and I enjoyed the story this time around.  If you have a HD DVD player, these are well worth the investment, superb audio and visual with non stop action, a great combination.
0312427999|1.0|Specious arguments and plain facts that are wrong. Her indictment of Milton Friedman is especially stomach-turning.     On Amazon, you can sort the 1-star reviews. Many of them have very valid reasons and observations of the various lies in this book. However, these reviews are far outweighed by positive reviews of people who have not been exposed to the actual writings of Milton Friedman or other people who have real ideas.    I can only hope that this book and the ideas that it carries will fade into obscurity because it is based on a foundation of lies. I shudder to think what might happen if people started to really believe these lies and to act on them.    [...]

1577314808|5.0|I am a middle-aged professional with an academic background in philosophy.      As I grew older, I felt more strongly that there must be a spiritual realm to our existence.  But I relegated myself to the belief that any understanding of this spiritual realm was not to be.  That such things would remain a mystery.  At times, I would have more spiritual feelings and sensations which reinforced this belief, but still felt that my belief of the spiritual realm would be faith-based and could never go beyond this.      As I entered into my forties, I entered into unrest and discontent with life.  I felt spiritually, intellectually and even emotionally dead.  Raising two great children and being married to a wonderful person was not enough.  The routine of daily life was not fulfilling, materialism provided nothing of spirtual value, and I walked through life with a general feeling of discontentment.      About a year ago, I entered Barnes and Noble because my 11 year old daughter wanted to buy some new books. I dropped her off in her BN department and walked straight across the floor to this book which was sitting on a shelf -- the book not being singled out or advertised specially.  It was the Power of Now.  I picked it up, looked at the cover and decided to allow myself to impulsively purchase it (something that was out of the ordinary for me).       The next two weeks were incredibly intense for me.  And what happened after that was even greater.  Tolle's words rang truth to my core.   For the first time in my life, my existiential views were married/bridged with a deep spirituality.   It made sense.   I couldn't put the book down.   As I read it, I used the meditation practices that Tolle subtley infers.   The inspiring energy of his words aided me immensely to get into a transcendental realm -- a switch.  Not magic, not really enlightenment (as the term conjures up something unreachable and unrealistic).  But I felt at peace and felt joy.  I felt intensely transformed.  The world came to me and I accepted what it gave me.  I accepted the world existentially.  My mind was finally much, much calmer.   For the first time as an adult, my mind didn't control me.  People and my environment vibrated with a vibrant energy.  I knew (not believed, not faith) that there was a One Being that essentially came from stillness or silence and everything was one with that One Being.  (Reminiscent of what I think Sartre's Being and Nothingness painfully attempted to point out).  I felt this sense of peace on and off for a month or so.  Admittedly this intense feeling declined somewhat as a result of some crisis life situations that proved too difficult to surrender to.  I am still \\"working on it\\" with the joy of knowing that this spiritual realm exists.    This book is the greatest book I've ever read which -- to me -- says much considering I have read many of the great works of literature and most philosophers.  No book has come close to this.  Tolle's presentation (and what he calls \\"sign-posts\\") are succinct and clear. The only problem I have with this book -- and I say this with humor -- is how the book was marketed.   Its title, \\"The Power of Now,\\" and cover art is so sensationalistic that it looks like it should part of an info-commercial along with Ginsu knives and the Ronco fruit dehydrator.  I fear that many in the academic world will dismiss the book as such without giving it a chance.  I hope I am wrong.   I also hope that if the world makes deeper into the future, that this book is mandatory reading for all students.    I hope you find the energy of my review helpful.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|One of the best period dramas out there. A stunningly good performance by Richard Armitage and nearly everyone else in the cast. Great story set in an interesting era of Britain's history. A must see for any fan of Pride and Prejudice or any of the other Austen movies.
B0000025RI|5.0|Okay, so here's an idea. Let's approach this album with an open mind. Let's forget all about Michael Jackson's \\"whacko Jacko\\" antics. Let's forget all about the \\"boys pants half-off\\" jokes. Let's forget about all of that. Let's just think of the music, shall we?<br />The music here is classic. Despite really being a product of its time, the album's held up very well. Of course, it must be noticed that this is the biggest selling album worldwide by a very long shot. It has sold - wait for it - 65 million copies worldwide since its release and has gone platinum twenty-seven times. And seven of the nine tracks were Top Ten hits, specifically the title track, \\"The Girl Is Mine,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Billy Jean,\\" \\"Wanna be Startin' Something,\\" \\"Human Nature,\\" and \\"P.Y.T.\\" And I love all of the hits. The dance tracks are aces all around, from the giddy camp of the title track to the disco of \\"P.Y.T.\\" to the hard-rockin' \\"Beat It\\" (featuring Eddie Van Halen on guitar!) to the African rhythms worked into \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something.\\" A party without any of these songs is not a party at all. One of my favorite memories, in fact, involves having a dance-off with a friend over a chair. What song were we dancing to, you ask? \\"Thriller.\\"<br />Ah, but it isn't just all dance. There's more to it than that. \\"Billy Jean\\" is the epitome of cheesy '80s synth-pop, with a bass part that will stick with you forever and fantastic use of synthesizers. I usually don't go for that kind of stuff, but this is different. This is really, really good music. And I love the two ballads. For one, I find \\"The Girl is Mine\\" HILARIOUS.  \\"Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover, not a fighter\\" just cracks me up. It's a great song, too. You know who cowrote and sang it? I'll tell you who cowrote and sang it. Paul McCartney. I mean, of course it's good! It's got Paul McCartney, the undisputed king of melody, on it. And I'm totally in love with \\"Human Nature,\\" the most melodic and arguably the best song on the album. Michael's vocals really shine there. And I LOVE that melody!!!!!<br />Okay, now that I'm done spazzing, let me get to the other two tracks. They're... disappointing. They're only bound to be disappointing. I mean, consider the quality of the seven big hits. Still, they're not bad. I'm not a huge fan of \\"Baby Be Mine,\\" but \\"The Lady in My Life\\" is an okay ballad.<br />But those seven hits have a lot going for them - melody, danceability, campy humor, cool guitar solos from Eddie Van Halen... yeah. Sure, it's overplayed as hell, but I don't care. This is one of the few truly great albums from the '80s. Isn't it ironic how I don't like '80s music much but I love the quintessential '80s smash hit? Funny how life works that way.<br />Can't forget the videos, either. No one moonwalks like Michael! Whether you're a gangster or a ghoul, you too can dance like MJ.el's vocals really shine there. And I LOVE that melody!!!!!   Okay, now that I'm done spazzing, let me get to the other two tracks.

B0013ND30W|5.0|Drug along at age four with the rest of the family, they thought I'd like the pretty colors, but I was absolutely transfixed.

The medieval landscapes with imaginary proportions and false perspective, just perfect.
B000002KFJ|4.0|By far the most ambitious, intelligent, and evil-sounding album Sabbath ever made. It's also probably the most underrated of Sabbath's \\"classic six,\\" since it never really produced a classic hit. However, it's still a great record.<br />A couple songs here are justly among Sab's most acclaimed these days. First off, \\"Symptom of the Universe\\" just might be the group's greatest song ever. Much has been made about the proto-thrash guitar riff. And I love the proto-thrash guitar riff. But I love the acoustic outro, which reminds me of Led Zep circa Houses of the Holy, even more. In my opinion, if something sounds like Houses of the Holy, it's bound to be good. The record's other classic is \\"Hole in the Sky,\\" a kick-butt opener with some pounding, powerful, murderous riffs. That is some fine riffing there! I love Tony Iommi. He's the man.<br />Ah, but the real cool thing about this album is the progressiveness. Sure, there had been extended Sab tracks before - take \\"War Pigs\\" or about half the first album - but none of them give off the same multipart feeling that the near ten-minute \\"Megalomania\\" does. I love that song! Maybe it's not as good as \\"Symptom of the Universe,\\" but it's definitely the most frightening Black Sabbath track. The riffing is brilliant, and the Ozz turns in his best vocal ever, right from the famous fade-in. There would be no Metallica without that song, and that would not be a good thing. \\"The Writ\\" is also extended, but I'm not a big fan of it. It's not terrible, and it's got a cool title, but it's kind of generic. Especially the first part, which is only noteworthy because Ozzy sounds a lot like Robert Plant. Still, the whispered \\"Rats... rats...\\" part rules. \\"Supertzar\\" is probably the most progressive track on the album - Tony Iommi soloing over a church choir - and it's a very interesting experiment for the group.<br />It's also by far the best song on the otherwise disappointing second side. It's got \\"The Writ,\\" which is pretty much average, and the keyboard-laden, generic AOR track \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" sucks. \\"The Thrill of it All\\" has the best pure riff on the first side, and is awesome until the stupid keyboard embellishments show up and hurt the song.<br />So side two is a big disappointment. But I love side one. It's even got an acoustic interlude, \\"Don't Start (Too Late),\\" that manages to sound pretty good, although it's out-of-character. So, yeah. It's really hard to argue with the first side of this thing.eyboard-laden, generic AOR track \\"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\\" sucks. \\"The Thrill of it All\\" has the best pure riff on the first side, and is awesome until the stupid keyboard embellishments show up and hurt the song.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This movie is the real deal! Check out \\"Ozma of Oz\\" and \\"The Land of Oz,\\" which take place after the events in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" to see how L. Frank Baum envisioned Oz and then compare them to this movie. Walter Murch, not only got the look and feel of Oz right, but he also got the personalities of these new characters correct. Watch this movie to learn what Oz was really like. Jack Pumpkinhead deserves our love as much as the Scarecrow! Bettina the chicken is more Dorothy's pet than Toto. Enjoy the diversity of L. Frank Baum's imagination! You won't be disappointed. This is a GREAT film!!!    I, too, had been brainwashed by the MGM-version of OZ, so much so that I wouldn't even read the OZ book series. It was in my 20's, while recovering from surgery that I started to read the L. Frank Baum books. I found them to be much richer, interesting, darker and with deeper personal relationships than the MGM Wizard OZ-lite version. I was hooked.     When this movie came out, I was enthralled and amazed. There were other people who loved the original stories as much as me! Fairuza Balk is an age-appropriate Dorothy; Dorothy did have a pet chicken named Bettina that is featured in many of the \\"Oz\\" books who talked and eventually decided to remain in Oz; the importance of Jack Pumpkinhead cannot be overstated for the rest of the \\"Oz\\" books and is an interesting statement on certain stereotypes (which I won't mention because it would be a spoiler); the storyline of how Oz had changed while Dorothy was gone can be seen as commentary of how Kansas had changed after the twister and on how much Dorothy had changed as a result of her visiting Oz; etc. While many people have commented on how scary the movie is, there are also girl-positive, funny and very magical parts to this movie. While it is not appropriate for the very young (and neither is the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" for that matter), it is perfect for ages around ten and older. They read, see and hear of more frightening events daily.My suggestion to you is: Go ahead! Give it a try! :) I don't think you'll be sorry!    FOOTNOTE: Prior to Return to Oz's opening, Disney released a \\"Making Of\\" documentary that showed how they filmed the claymation of the Gnome King (this was a very novel technique then), how the witch transferred the different heads, how the heads had different expressions while in the closet, the workings of Tic-Toc (who I fell in love with), the animation of the Gump (another lovable creature), how the costumes of the Wheelies were made and the how the actors moved in the costumes and more details. The documentary also presented some amazing-but-true urban myths about the two Oz movies, such as: Fairuza Balk, Walter Murch and Ray Bolger believed that the land of Oz truly existed. Another story was that the coat worn by Frank Morgan, when he played the traveling salesman in \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" was bought as a thrift store so that it had that look of wear and dirt. In order to fit Frank Morgan, a seamstress inverted a sleeve and found the name \\"L. Frank Baum\\" embroidered inside! This had the effect of totally freaking out the set of the MGM studio, while others felt like they now had L. Frank's blessing. I remember that Frank Morgan himself relayed this story in the documentary. Ray Bolger was very old and possibly, one of the last main characters to be alive at the time of this documentary. He was propped up by pillows and it looked like it took some effort for him to talk. However, he told the story of how, when he auditioned, he pleaded to be considered for the role of the Scarecrow. When asked why, Ray answered something like, to have more time with Do-ro-thy, of course. (You remember the way he said the name \\"Dorothy,\\" right?) There were other very cool remembrances that I'm sure I've forgotten. But this documentary really helped bridge the MGM-Oz with the Disney-Oz. If anyone knows where to get this documentary, please, please contact me.
B000002KDO|4.0|Wait a minute, wait a minute... this is a Christian album? Is Black Sabbath going all Jesus freak on us? Um... what the hell? Why is Ozzy telling me that God is the only way to love? Okay, this is getting on my nerves. I'm gonna go listen to something else.<br /><br /> But wait! This album's good! Very, very, very good! Tony Iommi touched on the overlord of guitar tones here. Like your guitars deep, heavy, grumbly, thick, and evil? Oh, then you've got 'em all over this record. Check out \\"Sweet Leaf.\\" A song and a half, that \\"Sweet Leaf!\\" Or, more accurately, a riff and a half! Ah yeah, man. The ultimate pothead theme song. I'm a-thinkin' it's Sabbath's very best song, with only two real competitors. One of them is \\"Symptom of the Universe...\\"<br /><br /> ...and the other is \\"Children of the Grave,\\" which is right here, on this very album! What's better than a song with one great guitar riff? Two great guitar riffs! What's better than a song with two great guitar riffs? A song with one of those guitar riffs played on guitar and the other played on a heavy, distorted, Jack Bruce-like bass that sounds like a guitar! It's really fast, too. It's one of those quintessential proto-thrash songs, along with \\"Symptom,\\" \\"Paranoid,\\" \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" and probably something by Motorhead. The song just keeps on delivering one great guitar part after another. There's even a slow section with haunting keyboard embellishments! Score! And it's anti-war, and if you ask me that's reason enough for it to be cool. Something tells me Geezer Butler didn't like war. I mean, \\"War Pigs,\\" \\"Electric Funeral,\\" and now this. Nothing wrong with that, of course.<br /><br /> \\"After Forever\\" is also great. Despite it being one of the more overtly Christian songs on this album, it's got the same heavy, sludgy doom riff we know from Black Sabbath. Totally grooves, too. Did I mention that those three songs are all on side one? Something about side one of Black Sabbath albums. Consider how amazing the first sides of Paranoid, Master of Reality, and Sabotage are for a minute. On the other hand, side two is a bit of a letdown. The Jesus anthem \\"Lord of This World\\" is a fine slab of sludge, though I still can't get over how weird it is hearing a band named Black Sabbath singing about the healing powers of God. But I don't really like the rest. \\"Solitude\\" is terrible, as a first. Black Sabbath should not be doing weepy, melotron-laced ballads. Some people can pull it off, but Sabbath can't. \\"Into the Void\\" is pretty much by-numbers sludge. And \\"Orchid\\" is a lousy acoustic instrumental. Iommi rocked the electric guitar, but Steve Howe he was not.<br /><br /> Still, a fine follow-up to the indisputable classic Paranoid.noid, Master of Reality, and Sabotage are for a minute.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|I was skeptical that anyone could surpass Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan as 007, but with the right script, Daniel Craig has brought depth to the character who had previously been seen as a miraculously lucky, womanizing, defender of the free world.  He is still lucky, dodging machine gun fire, playing cards (Hold 'em instead of baccarat), etc., but not so over the top that it becomes ridiculous.  The torture scene, while unique and interesting, did lack some credibility.  Overall, though, this an excellent Bond who brings new legs (as well as a fresh face, body, and mind) to the long-running franchise.
B0018QCXGY|2.0|While this film has a lot to recommend it, it is a disappointment overall. I liked the idea of a video record of an attack by a monster from the viewpoint of one person's camcorder. The performances in the film are good and the special effects are very well done. However, the overall effect never really gets you involved with the story. The monster is only seen in quick glimpses untill the very end of the film. There is no clear resolution to the film's story, other than you know that there is a military attack on the monster and that the camcorder was found later on. (Spoiler alert) You only know that most of the characters that you are watching die, one in a very gruesome way.   The films concept was a good one, I thought, but if you're going to see NYC trashed by a monster, get the remake of Godzilla. It's not a great film, but at least it doesn't take itself too seriously and has some fun to it. This film is a major downer and doesn't really hold together.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This has to be by far the best of David Gilmour's solo work.  It sounds very much like a typical Pink Floyd album.  The guitar solo on \\"Raise Raise My Rent\\", is awesome.  \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" is a timelsss classic.  And \\"No Way\\" has some excellent lap-steel playing.  I like this album better than \\"About Face\\", and \\"On An Island\\", which are also excellent albums.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|Fairy tales  don't really happen in our world -- especially not the kind that actually involve princesses.<br /><br />But you wouldn't know that from \\"Roman Holiday,\\" one of Audrey Hepburn's earliest ever movie roles -- as well as her breakout one. This adorable romantic comedy balances itself nicely between a sweet little romance, a lighthearted romance and the bittersweet, overhanging specter of royal duty.<br /><br />Bored young Princess Ann (Hepburn) goes on a \\"Roman Holiday,\\" when she gets upset, is sedated by a doctor, and has an odd reaction to it. Soon she has wandered out of the palace and into the streets of Rome, where she is found by struggling American journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck). Since she appears to be drunk, he takes her home.<br /><br />When Joe realizes that he has the missing princess in his apartment, he takes her on a whirlwind tour of Rome, with his pal taking photographs for a full article about her. But he doesn't count on falling in love with Ann, or having her truly fall for him. And Ann has a tough choice to make -- should she give up her royal life and stay with Joe, or fulfil her responsibilities as a princess?<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" is one of those rare movies that sounds incredibly trite and Hollywoodish when you just hear what it's about, because it's been done so many times before. Surprise -- instead we get a movie that is mostly a cute, innocent little romance, but with an inevitable choice that looms over Anne throughout her fun.<br /><br />But it's a fun ride while it lasts, with Anne and Joe careening through Rome on a scooter, dancing by the river, and getting her hair cut. This doesn't sound very funny, but William Wyler plays it with plenty of little jokes, including Joe's scandalized landlady raving at poor Anne in Italian, assuming that she's a one-night stand. And near the end he twists the storyline into a bittersweet examination of duty vs. love, with Anne forced to consider which way her life will go.<br /><br />And there's one joke that Peck played on Hepburn in reality -- the infamous \\"Mouth of Truth\\" scene. There's a reason Hepburn shrieked so convincingly: she had really been tricked.<br /><br />Hepburn and Gregory Peck are thoroughly solid as love interests -- Peck is breezy and likable as the jaded American journalist who is seizing an opportunity. And Hepburn showed off her range here -- she can be funny and quirky (including a hilarious \\"drunk\\" scene), then switch over into a doe-eyed sadness that breaks the heart.<br /><br />The Centennial Edition of this movie comes with an extra disk of assorted featurettes -- aside from the usual gallery and trailers, we have a half-hour special on Hepburn's Paramount years, and another twelve minutes commemorating her in general. Also has some stuff on the filming, the costumes, 1950s Paramount, and about restoring the film to primo glory.<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" is a modern-day fairy tale that never sacrifices integrity for cheap gooey romance.

B000NQPZCY|1.0|This has always been one of my favorite Costner films. Usually, director's cuts of films include omitted material, that expands on and enhances the original film. Tony Scott, the director, has now brought out a director's cut that is actually more than fifteen minutes shorter than the original. He has ruined the film.<br /><br />It's not just that the film has been shortened, but new material, that obviously was left on the cutting room floor originally for a reason, has been reinserted, totally throwing off the rhythm of the film and, while perhaps making it \\"faster\\", has ruined much of the character development and added nothing. It's much worse.<br /><br />Main change are:<br /><br />* A scene where Costner arrives in Mexico and has a conversation with Tomas Milan, Quinn's #2 man, is shortened so that the animosity between Costner and Milan later on seems less logical.<br /><br />* The scene of Quinn and Costner walking toward the tented dining table outside the house, just after their first tennis match has been shortened., Two key piece of character development have been cut. First, where Costner and Quinn talk about Quinn's tennis skills as they approach the tent, and Costner tells Quinn that Quinn \\"never concedes a point\\". The second, after Costner has given Quinn a leather flight jacket. One of Quinn's dogs grabs the jacket in his teeth, and Quinn ruthlessly grabs the dog by the collar and hurls it into the swimming pool, amply displaying Quinn's capacity for brutality.<br /><br />* A scene with Anthony Quinn and Stowe, just after Costner arrives in Mexico, that helps explain Quinn's relationship to his wife and her place in his scheme of things has been cut.<br /><br />* In the scene where Costner and Stowe talk alone in the library during the dinner party at Quinn's house, the part of the scene where Stowe enters and finds Costner reading a book of Spanish poetry, one of her favorite books it turns out, and he recites several lines in Spanish, and relates a story of his time serving in the Air Force while stationed in Spain, has been cut. This deprives the characters of one of the most important early empathetic links, that they are intellectually and culturally more attuned to each other than to the others around them. This also cuts Costner's line \\"Did I just blow your mind?\\", after he reads a passage aloud in Spanish and then translates it into English. This makes Stowe's use of this same line later in the scene, when she tells of how she came to be married, and Costner's line \\"it's not polite to mimic people...\\" rather odd and out of nowhere.<br /><br />* The scene where Quinn and Stowe talk by the pool after the party, as Quinn emerges from a late night swim and dons a robe, has been cut. In this scene Stowe asks what happened to Diaz, one of the men at the party, who Quinn had executed right in the house just moments before. He lies about the man's whereabouts. This is an important character defining scene for Quinn and shows Stowe's disquiet at her husband's unspoken but suspected activities.<br /><br />* In the scene at Costner's beach bungalow, the day after the party, Stowe suddenly appears, holding a book. The sequence where she gives it to Costner has been cut, as the preceding scene in the library with the book has been cut also. Nevertheless, on the next cut Costner is holding the book, with no explanation of how it passed between them or what it's import is.<br /><br />* In the scene where Costner and Stowe walk on the beach, the sequence where Costner tells Stowe about his failed marriage has had an alternate take substituted, with much vaguer dialog and poorer acting. Once again, this deprives the characters of the prior material that had showed their empathetic feel for each other.<br /><br />* In the scene at the beach where Costner shows Stowe the trick his dog can do, and Stowe dares him to let her try it, the scene of the actual trick has been substituted with an alternative angle and take thatis far less effective and satisfying than the original.<br /><br />* In the same beach walk scene, a further sequence of Costner and Stowe talking as they walk along, that gave Stowe's character nuance, empathy and dignity, has been cut, and previously cut footage of Stowe standing before Costner on the beech in a totally phony rain shower has been reinserted. This ruins what had been a charming classic bit of Costner business, and deletes a very sexy bit of chat between Costner and Stowe. Tony Scott seems intent on purging any hint of intellectual or cultural empathy between the characters, and seems determined to reduce them to comic book characters or. worse, just images of desire and attraction in a perfume or beer commercial.<br /><br />* The scene of Costner trying to make lemonade in the kitchen of his beach bungalow while Stowe watches, that originally appeared before they went for their walk on the beach, has been shortened, cutting intimacy between the two, and now appears before they go for their walk on the beach. This scene was the payoff of the beach sequence, that showed the growing sexual awareness and tension between the two.<br /><br />* At the political victory party, Costner appears in his jacket, Then he is suddenly standing at the buffet table without it. The short bit where a maid asks him if she can take his coat has been cut, which then makes it somewhat less obvious why Costner has gone to the room where guests coats are being kept, where he meets Stowe for their first love making.<br /><br />* The scene where Costner and Stowe talk while standing by the swimming pool at the party has been cut. In this scene Costner comments on the between the lines nature of their relationship, telling her he didn't come down to Mexico to get into trouble, and looks up to notice Tomas Milan observing them from a balcony. Without this scene the later scenes where Quinn implies he knows there is something going on between Costner and Stowe seem more abrupt and from out of nowhere.<br /><br />* New music has been added to the sex in the coat room sequence that is both annoying and distracting. The scene has been lengthened and made more explicit. The prior music, what might have been considered a \\"love theme\\", that was synergistic with both the party music outside and the theme music of the film, has been cut. The sex scene is now more explicit, brutal, senseless, and less interesting.<br /><br />* The scene of Stowe attempting to talk to Costner while she sits in his jeep outside Quinn's house, after a tennis game, has been cut. Once again, this is a direct attack on any material that would waste time on showing the adult level empathy and chemistry between the characters, anything that would reveal why they are, as human beings, so hot for each other.<br /><br />* The original scene of Costner and Stowe after love making in a hotel room has been cut and replaced with a shorter alternate angle and take of them in bed that explains less about their characters but clumsily foreshadows plot developments.<br /><br />* The scene of Coster and Stowe in the justly well known make out sequence while Coster is driving his Jeep has had the music replaced with a more contemporary track that totally changes the rhythm and feel of the scene.<br /><br />* The scene of Costner and Stowe swimming nude has been lengthened with previously cut footage of them hanging out and carousing, and Stowe doing a sexy dance, getting all over Costner in what appears to oral sex, and Costner drinking a beer. It totally ruins the feel of the sequence, and makes Stowe's character look cheap and vulgar, where before she had seem almost regal.<br /><br />* For reasons that are incomprehensible, the love making scene between Costner and Stowe at Costner's mountain cabin, a pivotal scene in the film that is prelude to the savage beating they both are about to take from Quinn, has been radically shortened, completely cutting a sequence where they talk in bed about ther lives and Costner tells about his war experiences.<br /><br />* The sequence where Costner convalesces with a Mexican peasant family while recovering from the beating he received from Quinn's men now includes a completely gratuitous and pointless scene of Costner helping the farmer get his old truck running.<br /><br />* Sally Kirkland's part has been cut down.<br /><br />* The scene at the end at the convent where Costner carries Stowe in his arms outside, where she dies, has been cut down and is now far less visually interesting and compelling.<br /><br />* Numerous small bits of dialog have ben cut, and a few extra bits of footage added that either obscure the character development or add nothing to the story.<br /><br />In short: one of the very best Costner films, and one of the best Tony Scott films, has been ruined by the director himself. If some of the cut footage had been added back to the original version it might have been supportable, and added to an already great film. To not offer both the original and the new version on the same Blu-Ray disc is just ridiculous.<br /><br />Shame on you Tony Scott! You have purged and cut every adult moment, every reflective passage, every poetic instinct and every empathetic gesture and utterance from the characters, all in the name of speeding up the film and getting a few more seconds in of Madeleine Stowe in sex scenes. You have needlessly used cutting room trims that were clearly left, perhaps under the adult supervision of Ray Stark, on the cutting room floor for good reason.<br /><br />Now we will never get a proper version of Revenge on Blu-Ray.

0060558121|3.0|This was a Christmas present from my sister-in-law last year.  I completely loved Anansi Boys and was eager to tear into this one.<br />I must say, I really thought Anansi Boys was a better book.  That isn't to say I didn't like this one, I just thought that Anansi Boys flowed better.<br />I really loved how he took ancient mythology and breathed new life into the old stories.  I honestly found myself wishing more of the story was from the perspective of the old gods rather than the main character, Shadow.  I just didn't find the main character all that engaging.  I thought it was really clever plot and I love his writing style.<br />It reminded me a lot of another book I read years ago by the title of Shadows Fall by Simon R. Green.<br />Overall, a fun book that just didn't match up to Anansi Boys.
B00004R9A4|5.0|My husband and I had been looking for this movie for quite some time and couldn't believe that we actually found this on Amazon.com.  We were so excited and couldn't wait to share this with our entire family.  Our grandchildren thought this was just absolutely awesome.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Hearing Maiden Live on the CD version without seeing them just doesn't do them justice.  Contrary to some other reviews, this DVD has plenty of old classics like \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\", \\"Wrath child\\", and \\"The Number of the Beast\\", and the newer stuff totally rocks.  The dueling guitars in the second half of \\"The sign of the Cross\\" are just classic, even by old school Maiden standards.  Up the Irons!
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Hello, I (we) have been patiently waiting for the 5.1 mix of \\"On An Island\\" since David Gilmour \\"promised\\" it to us at the time of the initial release. Here it is in all it's purported glory. The DTS playback takes the cake for me due to the expanded bass and the fact that I can play DTS discs without any filtering via my Denon 2900 player. The 5.1 mix is great- very discrete. All five channels are used, with classy restraint. Not as aurally \\"wild\\" as the DSOTM SACD got at times, but still very exciting to finally hear. Can't say much more about the other DVD content, because I primarliy purchased this set for this 5.1 offering. Thank you.
B000MGVCFO|5.0|This album was the first one I had heard by the Moody Blues way back in 1974 and as such has always held a warm place in my heart. It was wonderful to hear all the old tracks again and \\"The Dreamer\\" is a great find (I just wish they had finished it!) Some reviews mention the listing of \\"After You Came\\" as a bonus track that was not on the release; my copy, however, did not include this error so it must have been corrected. I wish instead of the omit they had added the selection to the bonus tracks! Don't you?
0375826726|3.0|I really was really exited to read this book  I like Eragon Love Eldest, but Iwas expecting something more from this book, I always suspected the true parantage of Eragon,the best parts of the book is when Eragon gets his sword, and find out about his true father , is really sad how Oromis die but it was also expected. I saw nothig new(excep that a lot more elfs and dwarfs) , nothing relevant, and the fact that Eragon is leaving Alagesia for ever ,  does not make me wana read the last part, i waned to see more about Galbatorix, and less of  Roran , and i predict that  The las egg is going to hatch to Roran en he will rule once  Galbatorix is dead , this  series are getting so predictable.

A few words off here and there but not a big deal. I have it in my car right now. I love the daily affirmations for each chapter. (Prospertiy, self esteem, work etc.)<br /><br />Great gift for yourself or for others.
0452289963|3.0|I have been attracted to Tolle previously because he has such a clear way to express his opinions and experiences.  I had a problem with this book, especially during the Oprah class broadcast. In this book and over and again in the class, it was emphasized, that \\"it can only awaken those who are ready.\\" Several times people were told they \\"weren't ready\\".  But who said Tolle was THE messenger?  There are numerous messengers delivering the message of enlightment, life purpose, awakening and all that. So maybe Tolle just isn't the messenger for everyone.   I've mentioned this to many people and I get different reactions from, \\"yea, that bothers me too\\", to \\"you're just not ready, Amy\\".  For the most part, the information is a compelation of spiritual teachings of many religions, and it's meshed with his personal experience and attitude.   Good for him that he says he no longer has an ego, however, based on some of his writing in this book, it seems that is just his interpetation.  I appreciate his presentation of informaiton, and food for thought, but he could have left out the judgement at the beginning of his book. I am not ready for his opinion on my readiness.
B000001DYY|4.0|Those who bought this CD, knew Curt was gone. I always felt Roland was a stronger songwriter; so I knew what I was getting, Roland's honesty and all the rest. I love the title track Elemental, and also Fish Out Of Water. This was not an overproduced affair like Sewing The Seeds, there is an energy behind Power and Fish Out Of Water that simply cannot be denied. I was prepared when I saw Roland & Co. tour behind Elemental, the live show was Fantastic. Elemental sounded better live than the CD, and Gail Ann Dorsey was wonderful singing on Woman In Chains & Badman's Song . TFF came back to l.A. for a return engagement, after the tour was over, Roland added \\"Creep\\" to the setlist. 1st time I ever heard it, o'well. After Elemental, I knew Roland could carry on fronting TFF, I'm so glad I caught this show Live. My chips are placed on Roland.
B001CXW8CW|5.0|You already know this movie is amazing and I do not need to tell you why. I have Batman Begins which included the first six minutes of The Dark Knight and was the most beautiful thing to ever transmit from my PS3 to my 50\\" plasma. If Warner Bros. does this right (and I can only assume they will), this movie will look stunning beyond compare. It is clear the direction and cinematography are superior, but on Blu-Ray this movie will stand alone. The Blu-Ray will also feature the shifted aspect ratio as seen in the film, between IMAX and the standard 2.35:1 format.<br /><br />The movie itself, well, in my top-5 all-time favorites. I had been waiting for this movie since December and it delivered despite my stratospherically high expectations. Christopher Nolan's superb script and direction, along with some of the best actors on the planet, merge to create one of the best crime dramas of all time (and if you want to consider it a \\"superhero\\" movie, the superlative of the genre without question). All I can say is thank you to Christopher Nolan and crew for rebooting a damn-near dead franchise thanks to the hack known as Joel Schumacher. My favorite comic book hero is back and better than ever.

B001DPC52C|5.0|The songs played throughout the Black Symphony concert come from Within Temptation's Mother Earth, Silent Force, and Heart of Everything albums, with at least half the songs played from their latest album. Sharon's voice sounds beautiful and the band plays along with the orchestra and choir seamlessly. There are a couple less-than-perfect notes in the concert and yet they still make it sound great.    Visuals to the show include pyrotechnics, Sharon's costumes, fantasy dancers, and a video screen which displays music videos, ethereal landscapes, and composite war-related footage along with the music. Special kudos to the acoustic songs (Forgiven, Somewhere), as well as the songs which made the best combination of the band with the orchestra (The Promise, Truth Beneath the Rose).     The singing, instrumentals, and talent of WT make their performances extremely exhilarating. The quality of video footage of the DVD and the audio on the CD make Black Symphony a must-have in symphonic rock/metal lovers' collections. This and WT's Silent Force DVD are exceptional concert DVD's.

B001BKG9SA|4.0|The addition of an orchestra does wonders to the overall feel. Nice companion to \\"Remember the Night\\". It's great to see David Gilmour found his voice outside of Pink Floyd - highly recommended.

B00005U11Z|5.0|My husband and I saw this concert on DirecTv several years ago and we both loved it.  I finally broke down and searched for it online and found a good price on Amazon.  It arrived very promptly, and we have watched it twice already.
B0010X745K|2.0|i like just about any horror film and i acquire any film that even smells like it has lovecrafty parts to it.      the problem with this film is the ending, not that i wanted a tidy hap liv ely aver efter ending, i dont like those either but the issue for me was that i never felt they were really at the end of their rope for such a drastic measure.  he wasnt compassionate and doing the right thing, he was a loser who couldnt take it anymore and assumed the boy felt the same way, Lord save us from good intentions.  fight or flight?  well this idiot chose neither, his solution ruined the movie.
0452289963|2.0|I've heard great things about this book, so though I would give it a read.  Overall, it's a good read, but I feel the author is stating the obvious and constantly repeating himself.  There are only so many ways you can state the same claim and I felt those ways were exhaused in this book.  You definitly do not need this book to awaken your life.  It will only reiterate what is already obvious to any sensible person.  I would NOT recommend this book.  The author has not found the purpose and answer to life.  In fact, anyone could have written a book like this.
B000J103OI|2.0|Much praise was given to this less then interesting film. A two hour waste of time unless you are looking for something that won't require the use of any brain cells while viewing.
031606792X|5.0|I am so surprised by the passionate and negative reaction to the end of this story. For me reading a book like this was an escape from real life. It was a fun bit of entertainment. I like the happy ending. The characters are so well written and feel so real. I am glad they all end up happy in the end. I wish she would write more about the wonderful things they get to experience in their happy life together.    *Spoiler* I know that after having my son I could understand so many decisions that Bella makes regarding her pregnancy, birth, and afterward with her daughter.     I think that there doesn't always have to be a message, but sometimes an escape into a fictional world can be a good thing. Someone else suggested that if you want to teach a lesson perhaps you should have a conversation. I think that would be the best solution.    Great read. I hope the author doesn't forever walk away from the Twilight characters!
B0011UBDTK|4.0|Short review here: when I asked my wife her opinion on the box set I purchased for her birthday her reply was - 'I don't know, I like it.  It's good.  I love those skanks!' - perhaps no better, or meaningful review of the show is possible.  Take it for what it's worth.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|This possibly was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. If you like British humor, you will enjoy this.  The language is a little too strong, therefore I would not let the kids watch it.  The story line at times is   predictable but there are just as many surprises along the way.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|i was excited to hear that there was going to be a movie based on the other bolyen girl book. the book is from mary boleyn's point of view. the movie, however, follows the point of view of anne boleyn. the acting was good, and the costumes where great but i just wished that they had stuck to the book a little more closely.
0375826726|2.0|Brisingr is obviously just an extension of Eldest, the book is rather dry , and mainly focuses on Eragon finding a sword. the deaths of Glaedr and Oromis were entirely pointless.  Paolini probably wanted the dwarven council to symbolize american society today but it detracted from the story.  all in all i was highly disappointed
B000J6I0VG|4.0|I am a fan of profound films, you know \\"meaty\\" ones, with jarring plots, and humanistic stories. However, I have to say I had a blast watching this, at 32 years old. The PQ was great, and the story was engaging, as it reminded me of all of the challenges of HS. I love Superman and generally enjoy the \\"superhero\\" genre. This was a fun spin, with cool characters, and of course, many interlaced Disney messages, and I'd highly recommend this, for a fun night of Blu-ray fun!
B000008H1Y|5.0|\\"Enchanting\\" is the word that comes to my mind.  No matter when or where I listen, this collection of woodsy, earthy tunes sends echoes of campfire scents and crackling leaves resonating through me.  I call it my Autumn Soundtrack, and like a fine wine, it goes well with everything and only gets better with time.  I won't waste time repeating what others in their reviews on this site have already expressed so well.  I will only add this: I have waited for this album all my life.  Until I discovered Jethro Tull in my mid-20s, and this album in particular, I had a very ambiguous and ephemeral musical identity.  Songs From the Wood spoke to me the way no other piece of music has before or since, with the possible exception of Canyon Dreams by Tangerine Dream or Grace Under Pressure by Rush.  I had found my musical identity, my niche.  I had found the near-perfect companion to the meandering nature-inspired wanderlust of my soul.  Nothing makes my heart sing more than the earth in its purest, most undiluted form.  Songs From the Wood is more than music to me--it is emotion, it is nostalgia, it is natural, gentle, wonderfully flute-flavored transcendence.
0061122416|3.0|the alchemist is not the main character in the book. The main character is the little boy who is a shepherd, so it should have been called \\"The Shepherd\\".    This book has some interesting nuggets on spirituality, one of which is God is within people who are happy. However, the book was also corny at times, such as when people talk to their hearts and their hearts talk back to them. The ending is really worse than most books, because it's almost like the \\"it was all a dream\\" ending that most books avoid. Surprisingly, it's the non-spiritual aspects of the book that are more interesting than the spiritual aspects of the book. It is more interesting to read about the boy making money at the crystal ware shop than about the Soul of the World. The crystal ware shop owner is the most interesting character in the book, because he does not plan on going to Mecca in his life even though he is a Muslim. So he is the most non-spiritual character in the book which makes him the most interesting. Admittedly, I am not a spiritual person, so I was prepared to not like this book, but this book was a disappointment for me because the bar had been set so high (by all the positive reviews for this book). Ultimately, the book is a debate between which theory is truer: free will or determinism. The book leans more toward determinism because it believes in destiny. I however believe in free will.
0385512058|4.0|Worth reading if you're in need of some motivation from the perspective of the world of business.  The  book preaches the value of social networking and great ways to get started doing it.  Like they say, 'it's not what you know, it's who you know,' and that seems to be the main theme behind Never Eat Alone.
1594489505|2.0|The book is a overdramatic tragedy in which most characters are losing. Rasheed, the main bad guy, has more than one wife. Rasheed was a widower before he married Mariam and Laila. The two wives are polar opposite in character - Mariam is loyal while Laila is rebellious. The opposite characters attract and become friends.     Both women are foolish not to listen to their mothers, and as a result both women are like slaves under their husband. For example, if Laila, who becomes an orphan in her teens, had listened to her mother, she would not have been impregnated by Tariq and would not have to marry Rasheed. Throughout the book, Laila is hopeful even though she lives a difficult life under a burqa.    Mariam repents for the rest of her life because of one mistake she makes. Mariam's stepmothers are straight out of Cinderella. Mariam respects and regards Rasheed until she found porno magazines in his room. As we go on in this book, Mariam has lost so much hope that she becomes almost unhuman. (One of the answers to the questions at the back of the book is Mariam signs her name for her wedding and for the sentence given to her by the Taliban judges towards the end.)    Like the movie Titanic, which is mentioned in the book, the book has a few characters who are connected to each other and who are friends with each other (such as Jack and Rose, or Mariam and Laila) set against the backdrop of a disaster, such as the ship sinking or war in Afghanistan which has militiamen fighting. The book shows that Afghanistan is not a good place for even infant girls, such as Laila's daughter Aziza. The best part of the book is Aziza and her relationship with Mariam. The way the author describes Aziza's laughs and smiles is very good.     There are some modern women in Afghanistan before militiamen started fighting each other. Islam in Herat plays a more important role the Islam in Kabul. There are racial and ethnic differences in Afghanistan, a poor country, just as in USA, the richest country in the world. The West and Soviet Union are not described much in the book, except when Bush declares war against Taliban. Hosseini's American citizenship could mean he has a condescending relationship towards Afghanistan. The name of the title appears in a poem which describes one moon and a thousand splendid suns.
B0018J6FOW|5.0|Michael C. Hall is so good as DEXTER. This is by far the best show ever. When is SEASON 3 coming?!?!?!?!
0312995423|4.0|In the beginning, a Portuguese man kills a Japanese cryptographer. After this introduction scene, the action moves to the protagonist who is an American woman, Susan Fletcher. Her lover, David Becker, could be considered the most important male character in the book. Other characters include the head of NSA who is a black man, a common occurrence in many books nowadays as the world anticipates a black leader for the USA. The characters in this book we think are good are evil, and those we think are evil are good. In this space are characters such as Trevor Strathmore and Greg Hale.     The whole book is a long chase for Becker as he goes around Spain trying to find a ring which the dying Japanese cryptographer gave to the people around him. Once, Becker goes to a hospital thinking that an old patient in it has the ring, but in a surprising twist, the old man doesn't. Unlike Becker, Susan Fletcher spends most of her time in the book located in one building, the Cryptodome. While in the building, she finds out that the dying Japanese cryptographer had no North American accomplice, as the book previously implies. As the book is set in 1998, it gets most of its history about the Internet right (such as the dominance of the Netscape browser or the appearance of a new type of bad software, the worm).

B000HT2P9S|5.0|truly one of Gaiman's best. I adored this book so much, that I'm hoping he'll continue to write stories about Shadow in the future. He's written a short story titled \\"Monarch of the Glen\\", (included in \\"Fragile Things\\") that takes on Shadow's journey after the events of this novel...another excellent example of Gaiman's storytelling.<br /> This book is a must for anyone interested in Neil Gaiman's work, or mythology or both.
B001BWYTAS|3.0|Magical Mystery Tour Memories<br /><br />This newly produced hour long documentary on the making of the Beatle's third film - \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" - can be highly recommended to TRUE Beatles fans who want ALL the inside info. (These are the folks who covet every CD made of news conference interviews with the Fab Four). For those who remember seeing the film once, or have never seen it at all, it's worth an hour to watch, though references made by the interviewees won't mean much.<br /><br />Show on high quality video, the documentary is \\"hosted\\" by Victor Spinetti, the British actor who appeared in all three Beatles films. He is personable. With two or three exceptions, the persons telling their \\"memories\\" are individuals who happened to live in Cornwall when MMT was filmed in 1967. There is the man whose father owned the smal newsstand and the local policeman who had his 15 seconds of fame in the film. We learned how the Beatles were just \\"regular folks.\\".<br /><br />The two \\"names\\" in this doc are musician Spencer Davis, who tells a few good short stories, and Neil Innes from the Bonzo Dog (Doo Dah) Band, who actually sings a song. (The rest of the music in the film consists of instrument versions of MMT songs - none performed by the Beatles.)Oh yes, we get Paul McCartney's brother, Mike, - who is back to using the family name after many years as \\"Mike McGear), mostly slumming off of his sibling's reputation.<br /><br />There are 11 short interviews on the DVD as \\"bonus material).<br /><br />A nicely done package, but as I said above, really aimed at the Beatles completist.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B000W92AS4|1.0|I bought this product and I quickly returned it. The reason is that the content of the disc is not as it claims - Intermezzo 1936, but a copy of the Hollywood remake of 1939. As you can see, the advertisement carries the original Swedish poster and the violin player on the poster is clearly NOT Leslie Howard of the remake. But as soon as you start to play the disc you know you are deceived.  I think this is a false advertisement which should not be permitted.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|The elevator pitch for this movie is Godzilla in Manhattan, with a different monster.  And that's what you get in Cloverfield, a well-done low-budget movie that shows you don't need $100 million to make a decent movie.  A group of friends at a going-away party, with a video camera, are in Manhattan when a monster shows up.  Part of the genius of Cloverfield is that we don't know where the monster came from, what it's doing or what it wants.  Every other movie of this genre is from the POV of the science guy who figures out how to fight the monster, whether with \\"plain ol' sodium!\\" (\\"Horror of Party Beach\\"), some kind of radio waves, (\\"Beginning of the End,\\" as I recall), or by nuking the site to make sure.  In \\"Cloverfield,\\" the POV instead is that of the schmucks like us who would be running around wondering what the heck is going on after we find the head of the Statue of Liberty out in the street in front of the house.<br /><br />On the downside, there's a little too much pre-monster time in the movie.  And the video camera is magical - it has enough battery life to run through an entire party and a monster attack, with some left over to run the external light and Night Shot.  Where do I get one of those?  What's funny as well is that Cloverfield is supposed to look like it's shot on home video - so Blu-Ray is a little bit of overkill here.<br /><br />But at 90 minutes, Cloverfield keeps moving fast enough so you don't think about the holes, and the movie doesn't outstay its welcome.  It's at least worth a rent.
B000066C1N|4.0|This is a great soundtrack even if you have not seen the movie you will love the music.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|I really wanted to like it, but seriously, it did not excite me in the least. They will never get back to the Puppets days. Why are you guys doing this still? Just retire, its uninspired garbage. No emotion. None. Sobriety killed Metallica.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition!  I purchased it for my niece who is a big fan of the original and enjoyed watching it with her.  I would definitely buy it again and we will watch it for years to come for sure :)
B00005JPS8|5.0|With all the crappy movies that Marvel was dishing out recently (Spider-Man 3, Both Fantastic 4 movies, Electra, The Hulk, & The Punisher) I was a little skeptical as 2 whether or not I wanted 2 see this movie. Now I will admit that I am not an Iron-Man fan. In fact I knew almost nothing about him until I saw this movie but, after I left the movie theatre I wanted 2 know more about Iron-Man.      The reason why I loved this movie was Bcause of the character of Tony Stark/Iron-Man(played by the incredible Robert Downey Jr.). He is in many ways similar 2 Bruce Wayne/Batman(he's rich, a genius, runs a huge corporation, and in his spare time fights the bad guys in a really sweet costume). Now I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I think Batman fans will love this movie & see the similarities & Differences Btween Bruce Wayne & Tony Stark.      RDJr. really inhabited the role of Iron-Man mostly Bcause in many ways RDJr. is a lot like Tony Stark. My favorite scenes in the movie R when he is trying 2 test the parts 2 his suit. It showed RDJr.'s ability 2 be funny(even though he was getting tossed around the room a lot). Even though there's a lot of CGI in this movie and we really don't get 2 C Iron-Man punch a lot of people around I will agree that this movie was indeed one of the best summer movies I've ever scene. This movie really sprang Marvel back from its recent years of really bad movies. I strongly recommend anybody 2 C this movie if U didn't C it in theatres. Believe me U will want 2 C it over & over again.
0066620996|4.0|Great practical ideas. How refreshing it is to see a passionate individual pursue an idea to completion and take the time to fully investigate all possibilities.  It's been a great addition to my book club at work.
B00005JPY0|5.0|In the last scene of \\"Batman Begins\\" Batman flips over a card and it turnes out 2 B the Joker Card. When I left the theatre I thirsted for a sequal & when I found out that there was going 2 B 1 I kept going on the Internet 2 C who they cast as The Joker. It turned out Heath Ledger was cast as The Joker. As many Batman fans were back then I questioned whether or not Heath could play The Joker. It wasn't until I saw the 1st trailer that I started bouncing off the walls and began counting down the days until the film's release.       Then Heath died, I as many fans out there mourned his death and wondered if he had completely finished filming The Dark Knight. WBs put everyone's fears 2 rest & assured everyone that the film was finished filming & was set 2 B released as scheduled.       After I saw Iron-Man I wondered how could TDK top this movie. I found out the day of its release. 1st off The film leaves you @ each & every moment on the edge of your seat (I swear I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair). Christian Bale still proved that he was indeed the greatest Batman of all time. Aaron Eckhart gave a gr8 performance as Harvey Dent & even gave a chilling performance as Two-Face (that made Tommy Lee Jone's performance in \\"Batman Forever\\" look really bad). Gary Oldman continued 2 WOW me as lieutenant Gordon(who later becomes Commisioner). Maggie Gyllenhal made Katie Holmes look really bad as she took on the role of Rachel Dawes (That Holmes played in \\"Batman Begins\\").      But, I think that the performance that really overwhelmed all of these gr8 actors was Heath's Portrayal of The Joker. Now I must admit I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in the 1989 movie \\"Batman.\\" However, after seeing this movie Heath made Jack Nicholson's Joker look like 1 of those clowns that entertains @ children's B-day parties. Heath's Joker was Dark & extremely disturbed and loved causing mayhem in Gotham by blowing up hospitals in a nurse's outfit (LOL), poisoning the police commissionerwith sulfuric acid, making a \\"Pencil Disappear,\\" & blowing up the Major crimes unit building w/ a bomb implanted inside another prisoner. Heath's Joker looked more like he's represented in the comics 2day. He has no backstory (however, U find out bits & pieces of his backstory in some of his scenes), he's deadly, & even more insane than ever before. His look was extremely different also he had a carved smile on his face & long greasy green hair, & his make-up looked like it had been applied & didn't look like he had fallen into a vat of chemicals. Oh, and I almost 4got 2 mention this but this Joker gets the last laugh.      The movie is centered around 3 men: Batman/Bruce Wayne, Jim Gordon, & Harvey Dent. Joker sets his sight out on all 3 men but mostly on Harvey Dent & in a way \\"turns\\" Harvey in2 Two-Face & leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween all 3 men.       This movie makes Batman face the ? if whether or not he is really doing any good in Gotham or if he is the cause of all the mayhem that is happening in Gotham City.      2 months after the movie's release it has made over $500 million dollars making it the 2nd highest grossing movie of all time(beating all Star Wars films WOW)but still comming short 2 Titanic. Now talks of a 3rd Batman movie R comming up but 2 me it really doesen't matter if they come out w/ a 3rd movie or not. \\"The Dark Knight\\" left you w/ a conclusion and unlike \\"Batman Begins\\" didn't leave U wanting a sequal.      Now I know I probably wasted a whole page writing about my favorite movie of all time but all I have 2 say about it now is that if U didn't get 2 C this movie in theatres see it now buy the DVD, sit back & B prepared 2 B WOWED. The movie is about 3hrs. long but believe me there's so much going on it doesen't even feel like its 3hrs. So Sign-up 2 be notified when this movie is going 2 be released or pre-order the movie right now WHAT R U WAITING 4?

0767803434|4.0|Of course \\"AF1\\" has more plot holes than a Jerry Bruckheimer film, but watching this movie back in 1997 was one of the biggest cinema joys in recent years! \\"AF1\\" is a MUST for all Ford fans, as well as fans of action. Wolf Petersen is one of my favorite directors, he makes this movie 'take off' and really 'fly' with excitement. I also should say, Gary Oldman is probably the greatest working film actor today who has never been nominated for an Oscar, (as far as I know). I'm not saying \\"AF1\\" is 'Oscar material' but I'd rather watch this than something like \\"The Last Emperor\\". \\"AF1\\" may go down in my book as Harrison Ford's last great action role, so what if it's unbelievable? Almost a classic. It has it's flaws but is an otherwise very memorable film.\\"
031606792X|5.0|I was somewhat surprised by the negative reviews. Yes, everything wraps up neatly. But I did not feel it was a deus ex machina conclusion. To me, so much of it seemed to flow naturally from what went before. Yes, it is somewhat odd that the imprinting on the baby occurs, but this flows from the story before. And the baby maturing so rapidly makes it even less strange.    I am almost 60 so probably not the target audience, but I very much enjoyed these books. I also like Anita Blake, another vampire series, though that sometimes degenerates into too much sexuality and little story in several books. Those that don't are quite good.    I sure would like more detail on Ms. Meyers dream and Rowling's (Harry Potter) outline. It is hard for me to picture either scenario creating these massive tomes. I know I always did my outlines for papers after the fact!
