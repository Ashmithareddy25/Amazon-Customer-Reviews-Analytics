B000FTWB7G|5.0|... and once you have, stay awhile.  This is an excellent follow-up to \\"Fallen,\\" and a must for Rock fans.  You will find the perfect blend of hard driving rock, swelling orchestral layers, and the Gothic choirs we enjoyed on \\"Fallen,\\" but with the addition of Terry Balsamo on guitar and as Amy Lee's collaborater, the punch in the music is even better.  You've most likely heard the hits, \\"Call Me ...\\" and \\"Lithium,\\" but another personal favorite of mine is the albums closer \\"Good Enough.\\"  A truly positive message from a usually depressed and/or angry band.  This CD is definitely more than \\"good enough\\" and must be part of your collection. <br /> <br />Dino Smith <br />Chattanooga, TN
B000000XB9|5.0|If you long for the good music of the 60's & 70's...this is a good album to take that trip down memory lane.   <br />Good music..with lyrics you can understand....when songs actually moved your soul...a must have album for those of us who grew up to 60's & 70's  music & long for music of yesteryear!
B000089RVX|5.0|... but an awesome ride!! <br /> <br />Surely you have this one already.  If not, stop what ever you're doing right now and buy it.  You have been missing a true treat and that must be rectified NOW!  Order \\"Fallen\\" right now! <br /> <br />Why you ask.  I know you've heard \\"My Immortal,\\" \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" and \\"Everybody's Fool\\" on the radio.  Those are but samples of, what in my opinion is, an offering that has no weak track on it - every song will be a favorite.  There has not been a voice in Rock like Amy Lee's in quite some time - absolutely angelic!! <br /> <br />\\"Bring Me to Life\\" won the Grammy for best Hard Rock song, and Evanescence won the 2004 Grammy for Best New Artists based on the performances on this disc - both well deserved.  As I said, order it now! <br /> <br />Dino Smith <br />Chattanooga, TN <br />
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I got lured by all the five star rewiews to buy this box set. This is really the worst piece of sci fi I have ever seen. Except for the albanian seventies series Abosh the Space Dinosaur uncleverly made of cardboard south park style.<br /><br />Neither science nor fiction in Firefly presents anything new. Actors and props look cheap. Little tought has been put into the drama and the building of charcters or the cast or the props etc<br /><br />How can anybody seriously get money to make such?<br /><br />Characters are hollow and dialogue is daft.<br /><br />The usual sci fi multi kulti has been blended with western movie style<br /><br />but the cowboys on the terraformed moons show no match for the merry college crew aboard the Serenity.<br /><br />Do not buy this series!<br /><br />I blame Amazon for letting all Fox employes write panegyrical rewiews of this bottom end product.
0300108834|4.0|It's difficult to choose a history book for my husband, the history buff. He was surprised when he saw how simply things appeared to be written but he's been commenting that it's interesting, and he's learning things he didn't know, written from a slightly humourous perspective. He says it would be a good book to give someone who hasn't been interested in reading history before - very palatable!
B000028U0Y|5.0|My husband could not find this CD any where. As soon as I logged on to Amzon I was able to locate it! <br />He loves it!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is yet another great album from the Foo Fighters. As long as you avoid the copy protection hassles, this album will provide enjoyment for years to come.<br /><br />Disc 1 in this double album is typical of previous Foo style. It rocks hard. The first track slowly builds into beautiful noise as Dave Grohl exclaims \\"CAN YOU HEAR ME??... HEAR ME SCREAMIN?!\\". After that there is \\"no way back\\". The first disc is simply amazing, and I love every song. It simply amazes me that the Foo Fighters have such a definitive style of Rock, and that they are so good at playing it. These songs are just as catchy and intense as their former work.<br /><br />While disc 1 plows on in one direction, disc 2 takes a turn quite different from previous Foo albums, and sort of floats on in a different, but parallel direction. It has a more acoustic, almost tropical sound... strictly acoustic guitars, sometimes with quieted drums... and Dave's more mellow singing, yet it still has hints of the Foo Fighters classic style. On \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", Dave switches places with drummer, Taylor Hawkins, and although I don't think he sounds as good as Dave, the song grows on you, and it is a successful musical experiment. This disc shows a new side of the Fighters' style and I have to say I love it just as much. I have always loved the Foo Fighters' music for it's intensity, as well as for it's dramatic soft points. The second disc in this album accentuates the latter and is perfect for playing when you want to relax, focus, or fall asleep.<br /><br />Overall, this is a solid addition to your Foo Fighters collection. Disc 1 will rock your mind, and disc 2 will calm it down. This double-album is sure to get the \\"Best of You\\".<br /><br />-DJ Phazer
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Iam enjoying this album very much, as I already have his first one. <br /> <br />Good listening!!!
B00006JU7T|4.0|Serpico is a chilling scene at the world,and how it use to be.How one man fights to  make a difference. Also Al Pacino is great as always the man can act no wrong. All in all the movie is great and Al Pacino is even greater.

B00005Y7NK|5.0|This is getting almost impossible to find.  The BEST Black Sabbath recording EVER!  Buy 2 so when you wear the first one out you will still have a primo one left.  This IS for serious metal fans and headbangers.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Amy Lee has an absolutely fantastic voice! <br /> <br />She has taken the pain of something personal and turned it into a brilliant CD. The pain is so tangible you can almost taste it. The songs and lyrics etch themsleves onto your pysche and I found myself humming them even when I didn't have the CD on. <br /> <br />I have put Evanescence on my list of must have groups and I suggest that people who love rock with strong lyrics do the same.  <br /> <br />You rock Evanescence!!!!!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|What more can be said.... one of the greatest westerns ever made!  The start of the buddy pictures.  A great DVD as well with some nice features.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|What happened to at least an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise as well? Since my High School years, I've counted Dustin Hoffman amongst my all-time favorite actors. With films like \\"The Graduate\\", \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", \\"Little Big Man\\" (my favorite film of all-time), he just has a way with characterizations that make movies memorable. And \\"Rain Man\\", a film about two brothers reunited after years of separation, Autism, and so much more, is no exception. Well deserved Oscars for Best Film and Actor of 1988. Even better work for Mr. Hoffman than his previous Oscar winning performance for \\"Kramer Vs Kramer\\". But the emotional rollercoaster of mood changes Mr. Cruise was called upon to portray, was just as worthy a performance in my opinion. His best work to date. And so I ask once more; what happened to at least an Oscar nomination for Mr. Cruise as well?    In one of the more moving scenes on film, after Charlie(Cruise)comes to the realization that his autistic brother Raymond(Hoffman)just couldn't cope outside the institution he had been raised for most of his life, the two brothers heads touch one another's, and after a moment of silence the words are spoken by Tom Cruise; \\"I like having you for my big brother\\".    Great film making by director Barry Levinson. What a fun journey through every human emotion imaginable.
0316779237|5.0|I'm just thankful that I had the chance to see David Sedaris live so that I could have both his face and his voice in my head as I read his stories--that made them even funnier. If you love Sedaris on shows like This American Life, you'll just love the book.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|This is much better and more coherent than the theatrical release, and over an hour longer.  The extras make the characters of Baldwin, Balien and Sybilla more believable.  The film touches on subjects such as redemtpion, spirituality and our personal relationship to God (amongst many others).  I found these to add depth to the characters, and think that had they been explored a bit more and expressed so, would have benefitted the film by bringing forward the motivations and emotions within the characters. Never an easy balance though, given that so much was happening at the time in question, and Hollywood's ham fisted approach to such things generally.  Still, you can't help feel a little empathy as Balien travels to Jerusalem and climbs the mount to ask God for forgiveness, only to be greeted with resounding silence (he should have listened to his intuition). <br />Although I thought at times Orlando's performance was a bit wooden, and his ridiculous William Wallace speech before the main battle at the end had me stuffing wax back into my ears, I am glad I made the effort to buy this version.  <br />Since it was only available in NTSC and the format in Australia is PAL, I found a hack for making my LG DVD recorder region free from instructions on the internet. Better make sure you can play one beforehand if you are in Oz. <br />The pack includes 4 disks, two for the film and two of extras.   <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0679422714|1.0|Jung Chang's young intellect was formed in an environment where totalitarian propaganda substituted for reason and evidence. After she came west, she was unable to make the adjustment. She still thinks and argues the same way. Her ram-it-down-your-throat approach, strained interpretations, and outright distortion of sources make it look as if she does not trust the reader to make up his or her own mind. She should stick to reminiscences, at which she is adept, and leave history to competent historians. There are much better arguments against Mao than this. Philip Short, in just one example, makes an equally scathing case against Mao, but uses reason and an honest appraisal of sources. It is a compelling case. Chang's totalitarian mode of argument is so silly that it actually undermines the case against Mao by making it the subject of mockery. She thus gives comfort to the Maoists. Nobody except fanatics can take this book seriously, and the case against Mao should be taken seriously. As for Halliday, he should know better. \\"What does it profit a man...?\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is a must buy for any U2 fan of which I am a big one. <br /> <br />It is presented as a book. You open it up and to the left are the words to the songs on the CD and various pictures of the group throughout their long career. To the right are the disks. I think the way it is presented is brilliant. <br /> <br />These guys just get better with every release they do. Long live U2!
B000GTLQXU|3.0|I'm a sucker for a good disaster film, even a bad disaster film but Poseidon was riding the coattails of one of the biggest.  The film fails on only a couple levels, the main being the need to get into the wave so soon.  It hits the boat about 13 minutes into the film and you barely have had time to settle in with the anticipation.  I was hoping the DVD would have come out with a longer cut that gave us a slower opening.  This version hits so fast that the very first time we are in the captain's booth the wave hits.  Anyway, the FX are great and action sequences are pretty intense but in the end we do not feel for Kurt Russell or Dreyfuss the way we did for Hackman or Borgnine.  Still, I bought it as I LOVE them bad or good.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Being a long time Loreena fan, I highly anticipated this album.  I was hoping for more masterpiece songs like \\"Marco Polo\\" or \\"Samhain Night\\" (two of my favs). However, this album went in a different direction, and I love it!  The songs are at a slower pace than a lot of her previous work, but they are melodic and rhythmic. There are echoes of previous songs, which gives it a familiarness, yet the styles are different. I love the Middle Eastern influences. Back in 2003 I made my own CD of all my favorite Loreena songs and played it at my wedding. There are definitely two tracks from this album that I can add to my list of favorites... \\"Caravanserai\\" and \\"Kecharitomene\\".<br /><br />The way Loreena can mix Middle Eastern rhythm with Celtic melodies is unique, and I've never heard anything else like it.  I'm very excited to have a new Loreena album, and I really hope she doesn't wait ten years to release another one.  Also, Loreena, please play some live shows in the U.S.!
B0007MVXQG|4.0|It's an amazing collection. Dark, somber, grinding, yet some of the pieces like Wheels of Fire have that catchy, pop quality like Screaming for Vengeance. And in concert. Unforgettable. Halford looked like some wild, sci-fi cross between Elton John, Uncle Fester, and Frankenstein, lurching around in these full-lengthed leather robes covered in mirrors, or studs, or chains. But I digress. The CD is a must have for the metalhead. My only slight complaint is that it's a tad skimpy with only 10 tracks.
B000002H33|3.0|With all the new recording technology these days, you'd think that such classic albums such as Justice, Puppets, Lightning, and Kill'em would get remastered as even more recent albums from newer bands have even gotten remastered.  Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) recently went back and remixed and remastered all of Megadeth's catalog and they sound great.<br /><br />Because it's funny when a band that has only been around since the '90s has already gone back and remastered some of their first works, yet Metallica who is the crowning achievement in American thrash metal from the '80s hasn't gone back and remastered their catalog.<br /><br />Let me just say this, with Metallica, it may be a money issue these days.  Ever since I saw Metallica's documentary, \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", it's clear that Metallica, specifically James Hetfield, has gone through some troubling times in the last few years, and money might be tight for them.<br /><br />But, with that said, a thorough remastering job on these classic Metallica albums may be what is needed to rekindle some of the interest this band once had back in the hayday of '80s thrash metal.  If I were in charge of such project, I'd remaster all albums up through and including the Black Album, and maybe even the Load/Reload albums, 'cause even those albums are already 10 years old.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing...if you've heard Trivium's cover of \\"Master of Puppets\\" than you know how good this song could sound.  So a solid remastering of the aforementioned albums may bring them back from the dead so-to-speak.
0739334085|5.0|Has a nice ring, doesn't it?<br /><br />Wow. What a phenomenal book.  Even better to hear it in the author's own voice, a very pleasant and encouraging one.  Obama writes about the issues important to him, frankly confronting the many problems that face the modern world, and manages to present unusual and unexpected alternatives.  He writes with incredible honesty and openness, and listening to him, one is tempted to think he is the kind of person one would want to be President.  It's not that he's the consummate politician (that would be Clinton); rather he seems to be the ideal leader.  He doesn't shirk from the hard questions, nor does he even shirk from being open that he doesn't know all of the answers.<br /><br />Perhaps his most contentious remarks will be his ideas on Disk 4 on affirmative action- but even here he proposes novel solutions that all sides might come together on.  I appreciated his thoughts on religion.  He affirms the rights of all beliefs to practice, and feels we are a greater nation for doing so.  Yet he is comfortable and secure in his beliefs too, firmly accepting Jesus as his guide, through a decision that he made as an adult, and not simply because it was a cultural upbringing.  Perhaps the most interesting section was Disk 5's thoughts on family, and specifically Obama's family, where he presents a very personal and loving portrait, while still being honest in his flaws and where he doesn't measure up as husband and father.<br /><br />It's not Obama's fault, but rather the fault of the packaging, but there are some serious flaws in the CDs.  The package is designed such that one disk is on the outside, and it is additionally easy to slide cardboard juttings against the readable portion of the disk.  This virtually guarantees scratches on the disks, and therefore repeated areas, especially on Disk 4, where the disk is jumping and speaking like a broken record.<br /><br />For all that, I'd still recommend the audio version.  While an abridgement, it is Barack's own voice.  We get to truly hear moments of humor, and even fairly good impersonations of family members and other politicians as he engages in conversation with them.  This guy is a real person.  He might even be the real deal.<br /><br />For all the wonderful speaking and writing and openness he brings, there's one thing that comes through overarchingly.  He isn't Pollyanish.  Obama deals with the harsh realities, both in his own life and the lives of others.  And yet, and yet, he still has hope.  He still speaks of something better, and in a way that is practically and politically possible.  He has enough hope to inspire all of us to believe the same.  To believe that it can be better, and that it will be better.<br /><br />(This review refers to the Audio CD version.)oice.

B000GRUS22|1.0|I really, really love Enigma's first CD.  The second wasn't as great but it wasn't bad either.  The third was actually good for it's own reasons.  The fourth was remicient of the first and was therefore OK.  The fifth was marginally good, in that it took time for most of the songs to be interesting to me.  The sixth, and their latest, has finally just uninteresting to me.  I don't devalue it as I could grow to like some of the tracks but for the most part I'm unimpressed.  In fact, the only song that grabbed me was the Alchemist.  And even at that I wasn't all that grabbed.  I would recommend those that have listened to Enigma over time to listen first to the CD and then decide if this would be better downloaded as individual tracks instead of a full CD.

B000J103YI|4.0|The movie WAS great and Jennifer Hudson dominated it both in acting and singing.  She blew me away.  I watched the year she was on American Idol and Simon Cowell must be eating his words now.  Eddie Murphy was a very pleasant surprise too.  Who knew?

B000EHSVOG|3.0|Running across this movie on one of the classic movie channels the other night sure brought back memories.  I vividly remember when this Irwin Allen blockbuster exploded across giant movie screens nationwide; THE TOWERING INFERNO was a must-see, with all its mega-star power.  I was in the theater to take in this grand event, this video spectacle of epic proportions.<br /><br />Funny thing is, all those years ago I left the theater feeling kind of cheated (How can the greatest movie ever made cause a letdown?); and I still feel the same way about this overcrowded disaster yarn.  Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, William Holden, Richard Chamberlain, Faye Dunaway, Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, Fred Astaire, O.J. Simpson (who saves a cat, for crying out loud), Robert Wagner, and dozens of others (even Bobby Brady gets into this flick) all fight for lines and face time as a colossal, 140-story tower offically opens to the public. . .and promptly catches on fire.  The stage is set for heroics, for shenanigans, for despair, for heartburn, as the cast of thousands figures out how to save themselves amidst the blazing inferno below, above, around, and over there, by the planter.<br /><br />Incidentally, I got a kick out of the orange and green colors, the wood paneling, the gaudy fixtures, all so prevalent in the Seventies.  What were we thinking?  But alas, the movie ends, with some characters surviving, some characters smoldering, and something of a message that we silly humans should stop building our Towers of Babel.  But there's not much else to say, other than THE TOWERING INFERNO was tired melodrama with state-of-the-art special effects then, and it's tired melodrama with laughable effects now.  And that plethora of a cast; was that Dustin Hoffman running out of the 81st floor?  Maybe it was David Cassidy.  Heck, everyone else was in it.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, THE RECKONING
B00009EJC5|5.0|CD was received within days after ordering.  CD was in good shape.
B000002GYG|5.0|Waits's sense of humor shines on this album, delivered almost as a stand-up comedy act (with jazz quartet, of course).  His hilarious comentary and recitations provoke some genuine belly-laughs (I doubled over in spots).  Yet his lyrics retain the beautiful artistry that he has become known for.<br /><br />The songs vary from the hilarous (\\"Better Off Without a Wife\\") to the mysterious (his rendition of Red Sovine's \\"Phantom 309\\") to the beautifully tragic (\\"Putnam County\\").  He offers up tributes to love (\\"Nobody\\") and tributes to barrooms (\\"Warm Beer and Cold Women\\"). Throughout, Waits banters with the crowd, which becomes a staple of his performance on here--his chatter with the audience actually becomes part of the music on the album.  The result is a comedy album that isn't comedy, a jazz album that isn't jazz...but whatever it is, it's absolutely brilliant.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Ever since I watched the premiere in September of 2005, I can actually say: Is it Monday yet?! Great storyline and truly funny. Barney has some really unforgettable one-liners! The only downside is the Full-Frame presentation.  I've watched the whole series in widescreen HD, and it's weird to have the sides chopped off. Other than that, the DVD is a GREAT DEAL and worth the price for  an entire season of laughs. This is truly a love story in reverse!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|THIS DVD SURPRISED ME AT WHAT GREAT QUALITY IT IS.  I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO PROFESSIONAL.  THIS BAND IS AWESOME.  I HAD JUST WENT TO SEE THEM LIVE THIS PAST FALL.  THE DVD DOES A GREAT JOB OF SHOWING THE REAL BAND.  THE EXTRAS ARE GREAT TOO.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I started to follow the Cirque du Soleil shows less than a year ago. I had a chance two watch a couple of shows with my 4-year old son. He loved the shows so much we started to research and view the short video trailers for the rest of the shows available. \\"Love\\" is one of my son's favorites. We have not a have a chance to view the show live, but I bought this CD for me and my son as soon as it was released because I knew he will like it. I am not a big Beatles fan, I only recognized a few of the most familiar songs but I loved the whole music selection. Funny thing, my mother in law visited us for the holidays, and she absolutely loved the CD (she was 10 when the whole Beatle thing started) so we had to buy her her own copy.
B0000640VO|5.0|First off, I would just like to say that I love this film. It is certainly one of my favorites. Audrey Tautou is perfect as Amelie, and there is nothing better than watching her magical journey in this film. The visuals in this movie are like nothing I have ever seen before. It is so bright, colorful, and vibrant. Even though we know that Paris looks nothing like this, it is fun to dream. I especially love the pictures of the Gnome on his travels. The special features in this set are top notch. This film was meant to be viewed in French, so there is of course no English dubbing. All I can say about that is, Thank God! I can't even imagine watching this movie waith someone other than Ms. Tautou being the voice of Amelie. It is a clever, and truly life-changing film. After you watch this movie, you will never look at the movie industry the same way again!
B000I5X81K|3.0|I was disappointed in this CD. I've loved the others I have (2) by Josh, but this one just didn't seem to 'take me there.' I'm a big fan, but not one of these songs hit my heart. Sorry.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore presents an UNDENIABLE argument as to the effects/causes of global warming. The message is loud and clear; turn this thing around within the next 10 years or face serious environmental degradation. The film follows the ex-presidents personal and proffesional life over the course of his political career. It shows the conviction of a man set to make a difference; to not leave his own children in a world far worse than ours.  <br />You owe it to yourself and the rest of humanity to watch this film. Ask questions, educate yourself, make a difference. What are you doing about global warming?

1580086810|5.0|Marvelous group of photos and information on other cultures.  It is a reasonably good cookbook too.  The statistics on longeivity and diet are also interesting.  Perhaps the best part is showing children how people differ in their most basic wants, when they are met, and how cultures actually overlap with products made in, sold in, the U.S. showing up on other tables in other lands.  Margaret Thatcher said, to paraphrase, that she learned about the world of economics in her father's store.  Well, this is a composit picture of the world's grocery store and nothing beats good pictures except actually going there.

0375505091|1.0|I was looking forward to this book ,now that i have seen i cant imagine why i would ever look at it again.No doubt Leibowitz is a great society photographer(isnt that enough?) but here ,with artfully minimal captions we find a mostly family album where i suppose a picture should tell the whole story.If most of these pictures were not of Sontag,how would they be different from a photo album found at a tag sale where one excuses lack of choices and technique? BUT there are some special pictures even in this personal recordtaking,why weren't they edited.One might think this is one big vanity project..and yet how could such a visually inventive and savvy photographer layout so many potentially powerful photos across the gutter with often hilarious results,as in putting a pregnant belly on one page and herself across the gutter,SAD! There a handful of pleasurable entertainment photos that have not been seen in bookformat that are worth lingering over.A bunch of landscapes  take up much space but are truly worthless to anyone but the taker of them,perhaps as a reminder of a great breakfast or fond memories of friends who live there,it would be nice or upsetting to know more,but artiness is all we are getting.Now much publicity has been about the unsparing hospital photos,chemotherapy,death,why would i look at your snaps when i have my own to remember unless they reveal some bigger observance ?Some sharing of suffering is surely vanity.Why go on talking about this poor book? I only hope the libraries wont buy this and waste money best spent elsewhere.sorry.
B000I5X81A|5.0|JJ Cale or John Cale is the best he brings life back to his music and just captures how is sound is also dramatic  how he records his music and he is a true writter and how he influnced Eric Clapton and many styles I cannot wait when he comes to south florida for a tour
B0000DBJDM|4.0|This DVD has one aspect that confuses me. I do not believe that it is actually a live recording as the audio sounds just like the album, including vocal overdubs. The remastering is phenominal though. You can compare it yourself as one of the special features is the original version of the film. The only reason i gave this four stars is due to my original statement.
B000I0QK74|3.0|I was really looking forward to this album when I saw it advertised on TV. Amazon was SOOOOOO much cheaper than the web site in the ad. The album itself is good. A few of the songs are OKish, but most of the album is JT as we love him. I will definitely listen to it again, but it will have to wait until next Christmas.
B00004XPPC|4.0|This is a classic movie that I use to watch at night with my dad who passed many years ago. Yet it still brings back the memories and interest that it did when I was a kid.
B00002E224|5.0|I couldn't believe this movie when it first came out.  I had a nearly identical experience in Austria (same as the movie) in 1971.  The only difference was the gal was an American.  It made me wonder who had been following us around.  Sadly, i let her get away from me when we got back to the states.  Mea Culpa.   <br /> <br />I found it well done, and convincingly acted.  The street scenes and infrastructure was as i remembered it.. Overall a top notch production - sadly ignored by the media and movie reviewers.  Interaction between the two major characters was as i remember doing it.   <br /> <br />Even Hawke's line about: \\"In a few years you'll be married... you'll wonder how things would have worked out with someone else you'd met.. look at this as time travel..\\".  I actually used that line myself.  Incredible parallelism.  Basically i loved it..  <br /> <br />Cheers
0618680004|5.0|Again, Dawkins takes on all who believe in the supernatural, fairies, angels, pink unicorns, and even \\"spaghetti monsters\\" in this must read book for people with an open mind.  If you would like to increase your vocabulary, knowledge, and understanding of the world in which we live, then this book will explain a lot.  Unfortunately, the people that really need to read this book will do one of three things:  say it is a farce, not understand it, or burn it without opening the cover.  It is unfortunate that people have to lie to themselves about this particular aspect of their life.  Whether it is fear of death, inability to take responsibility for your life, or a meme, the ones who need to read, comprehend, and change their lives based on this book will never give it a chance.  However, if you are looking for the truth, then pick up a copy....and read it multiple times!
B000AP04L0|5.0|This film is for anyone who has ever had a job they hated, which should mean everyone. It basically does what everyone is thinking about doing, ie leaving work early, avoiding the boss, destroying work property, stealing, and does it in a very comical way. I am almost positive it even boosted the sales of the red Swingline staplers.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I saw the Cirque Du Soleil show on July 3rd and it blew me away (over 6,000 speakers including three in the headrest).  So glad they made a musical CD of the show.  I bought it the day it came out. Every Beatles fan should go see the show in Vegas at The Mirage and hang out at the Revolution Lounge (when it opens).  I bought this CD for my 10 year old niece and it is her first Beatles' CD.  I played it for my brother and it also blew him away.  Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You Without You is mind blowing.
B000002LK1|5.0|all the songs are so huge! listen and listen again it s a grest pleasure for our brain
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unlike the rest of the sci-fi dramas, (such as Star Trek or Battlestar), this is realistic.  The spaceports LOOK like a spaceport probably would - something like a dock area today, but with spaceships.  The people on the street are somewhat scruffy, there is dirt and trash about, and occasionally an actor needs a shave.   <br /> <br />I'm an engineer, and can't help noticing infrastructure and such.  This strikes me as quite realistic.  If you WERE colonizing a planet (which had nothing on it), WHY would you spend hundreds of years and billions of dollars building roads and bridges, when you could make do with horses and an occasional anti-gravity truck to haul freight or fragile stuff?   <br /> <br />Similarly, ray guns and (phazers) are neat and flashy - but how are you going to fix them in the field?  Try to get a digital watch or PC fixed in Beruit for example! (I have).  An old fashoned hand gun works much better - no batteries to charge, no flimsy plastic to break, works if it's raining or if you drop it in the mud.. you can't beat it.  Same with battery operated anything - how do you charge it when you're miles from a power line??  This series avoids all those idiotic conflicts by using basic technology where possible.   <br /> <br />The acting is realistic (imho).  Subtile things are in the scenery that tie everything together and leave room for further expansion (such as logos on shipping containers).  I was impressed at how well thought out the entire series was.  Basically the tramp freighter/backwater 5th world economic situation that is in place today in many spots 'round the world, translated a few centuries into the future with spaceships instead of sailing ships.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to have a trip to Scotland and I went to Dunne Castle where the movie was filmed.  Looking through the guest book, it was amazing the number of people who took the pilgramage to the castle from all over the world because of this movie.  The DVD is classic.  The bonus materials are great.  My sons love the legos version of the camelot song.  I enjoyed the documentary about the making of the movie and two of the pythons going back to the locations.  Absolutely wonderful.
B000EMGAOY|4.0|not bad for a come back, rhcp is always good. i think this cd would have been  better without certain added studio effects
B00008J2PG|5.0|For war movie fans who want battle sequences on the big screen and that alone forget about this movie.  This is a movie for people who want to see a drama/thriller set on location during the time of war. <br /> <br />Gregory Peck as Irishman Monsr. Hugh O'Flaherty wants to save Jews and Allied service men and Christopher Plummer as Col Kapler tries to stop him.  Both are well supported by Sir John Gielgud as the Pope. <br /> <br />This is a roller coaster ride of plot and sub plots and to highlight them here may take away some of the colour of the movie.   <br /> <br />The script is well written and shows the internal struggles at the time as well as man's inhumanity to man. <br /> <br />It is always a pleasure to see great scripts given to outstanding actors. <br /> <br />This is a movie that should be in every library and can be rewatched repeatedly.
0307346609|5.0|This book is incredible. I hope that they follow through with a movie. If you enjoy zombies, apocalyptic scenarios, survivor fiction, or just any well-told first-person narratives, get this book. <br /> <br />In fact get this book even if you like Berenstein Bear's and Cooking Guides, you will like it anyway.
074356619X|5.0|I listen to books on CD, but ONLY the unabridged versions. I had seen the movie and wanted more details. This fits the book (: I would have liked a more substantial case; glossy cardboard disintegrates in the bottom of a carryall. However, getting it so fast was more important than the packaging. A truly wonderful philosophy of life!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This series is fantastic!!  I just love the relationship between the mother and daughter.  My 14 year old daughter watches them all!  Can even open discussions pertaining to your own life/world. <br />
B000HEVZ9O|4.0|I enjoyed seeing all these movies in the theater and i will continue to enjoy them at home. The extras were interesting to see the behind the scenes of how the movies were made.
B000AMJDHY|4.0|There was only one song that I didn't care to hear more than once.  If you like up tempo rock then you will definitely love this CD.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book far after the hype that it wasn't entirely true, and it was embellished. Even after knowing that I found myself hating every page...in fact I found myself skipping up to 5 pages at a time just so I would be through with the book quicker. I felt like Frey was going for the heartstrings a little too much, which was hard to fall for after knowing most of it was a lie. I feel for those struggling with addictions and I hated that he capitalized on that. I also hated how he setup the dialogues, and just didn't like the writing style at all. Can't wait to trade it in at the local book swap.
B00005NTN5|4.0|I really only got it because Jennifer Tilley and Gina Gershon have a hot lesbian sex scene and I wanted to see them naked, but I actually started getting into the plot and it turned out to be a great movie. Really good crime drama. If you like The Sopranos, Goodfellas, Godfather, Scarface, or Casino, you will like this movie. I can't give it the full 5 stars because it is what I dub a one time movie, it's really only good the first time you see it because you don't expect what is to happen next. An example of a movie that does hold up view after view would be Pirates of the Carribean, because of amazing special effects you almost always find something you missed, and it's just a fun movie.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This DVD makes you want get up and do something, change a light bulb.  Lessen your \\"ECO\\" footprint.  Highly recommend it.
0307237699|5.0|Like most Americans, I first heard of Barack Obama only a couple of years ago, and I have casually followed his rise to fame since then. Like many other successful young leaders, he seemed intelligent, articulate, passionate, and concerned. After reading his book, I am left with an even stronger impression.<br /><br />What was amazing about this book was Senator Obama's ability to eloquently explain his views, positions, and opinions on some of the issues that have most divided this country over the past few years without sounding preachy, overbearing, arrogant, or offensive to those who may disagree.  He goes out of his way to explain why he believes as he does while at the same time acknowledging and advocating respect for the various opposing philosophies.  Throughout the book Senator Obama expresses optimism about the possibilities of reaching meaningful consensus, or at least compromise, with all parties.<br /><br />For me, this was so refreshing.  After years of witnessing such extreme partisanship and such unnecessary divisiveness in American politics and in the blatantly biased talk shows, Senator Obama's voice is finally uplifting and encouraging.
1400077915|3.0|This was a good book to read on a holiday because of the short stories (some shorter than others).  This was the first of Ms. Munro's books that I have read and I will read others.
0880796863|4.0|This deck is a lot of fun to work with.  I combined it with the \\"Learning the Tarot: A Tarot Book for Beginners\\" and enjoyed learning more about Tarot.  While the artwork isn't up to today's standards, I like the fact that it is the original design.
B00005JNS0|3.0|It took alittle longer to get here than I thought, and I also didn't realize it was a widescreen only edition. Most movies  give you the option to change to a normal screen, this one did not. But the movie was excellant and my grandkids love it.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This is a great movie that both my husband and i can watch together! <br />enough said?
B000F4MLZ8|4.0|This is a really good mello album. It kind of sounds like a modern day Simon and Garfunkle. I absolutely love Star Mile, in that mellodramatic kind of way.
B000IZJ1KC|5.0|Don't want to get into a lengthy review but the album is very good. Reminds me of Immortal most of the time with some motorhead influences thrown in. If your a fan of Immortal you will love the new cd from I.
B000F8O35U|4.0|This is a great movie, it's even better than I remember it. I'm glad to be adding it to my collection.
055358202X|3.0|If you've made this far through the reviews congrats!  I won't bother to repeat too much that has been said already.  I love this series, one of the best ever in Fantasy.  This was a weaker effort than the first three but I believe in the end Martin will redeem himself.<br /><br />At the end of Storm of Swords, much had happened in the seven kingdoms.  We needed a break, a chance to catch our breaths and regroup.  This one should be slower.  However, Martin needs to realize that editing, not cutting the book in half, is what should have been done.  As stated before, much of this book is wasted time traveling, talking about nothing and doing little.  90% of Sam's and Brienne's chapters could have been erased without any loss.<br /><br />Why didn't any of his editors challenge him and make him cut some of the excess fat in this novel?  The most frustrating thing is that A Dance With Dragons will be more of the same.  NONE of the cliff hangers will be rectified or talked about in the next one; do people realize this?  He said himself he will only do the other half of the characters that were missing in this volume.  So we won't know what happens to all of these people (some in dire straights to say the least) until the NEXT book after Dance comes out.  Lord only knows when that will be.<br /><br />Still, his customary writing skills and depth of both chacracter and story shine through.  I enjoyed it even though I saw the glaring flaws.  I can't wait til the next one.  And the one after even more.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is the best Feel Good movie I have seen in a long, long time!  The ensemble cast is wonderful.  Hugh Grant, Liam Neesom and Colin Firth in the same movie...it doesn't get any better.  I have watched it 3 times!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I heard mixed reviews about this CD, but having bought it and listened to it, I think it's a wonderful CD. I like that Josh is moving more into contemporary music. I was skeptical about \\"The Machine\\" when I first heard it, but now I like it a lot.
B000K2RD3U|5.0|This is my favorite Gentle Giant album. From the eccentric and warm  'Dog's Life' to the beauty of 'Think of Me With Kindness' to the complicated 'Knots' this album has it all for the Gentle Giant fan. As another reviewer noted, this is the best sounding of the Repertoire catalog of Gentle Giants. One problem, either I have a faulty disc or there is a defect in the mastering. On 2 songs, 2:14 of 'Knots' & 4:54 into 'River' there is an area of white noise which seems to skip about 1/4 of a second of song. Manufactoring mistake or my copy? Someone find out.
B000KP62MA|5.0|This delux edition is definately worth the purchase, even thought I had already bought the first edition of, ABL. The awesome holigraph on the cover and the \\"Rebirth\\" of \\"The Kill\\" is rad. The DVD is amazing and the awesome credit list of over 5,000 fans all along the inside of this delux edition is very cool, even more so because my name is in it :O)
B000028U0Y|5.0|I was very pleased with this album. It has a nice range of hits and wonderful sound quality. I would definetly recommend it.
0743216385|5.0|After watching the movie first, then reading the book, I wished I've read the book first. This book is one of the best I've read and I don't read a whole lot. What those men went through during the war, I can't compare to my experience's. I to was in two different wars, Vietnam and Gulf War. The hardships they endured along with the good times can only be discribe by those who were there. To Major Winters and his outfit my hat is off to you all. I just wish I could meet with those gentlmen and shake their hand and tell them thank you for sacificing so much in order that we can stand proud of our country and the freedom we have today.
0316236535|5.0|this book is fun for all ages to read a great book for kids to overcome their monster fears!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|\\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is one of those rare films that will actually move you.  What on the surface appears to be a dark road comedy about a dysfunctional family, is at its a heart a celebration of what makes a family.      The Hoover Family has its share of problems and appears to be barely scraping by, but when word from relatives comes that their youngest, Olive, has qualified as a semi-finalist in a beauty pageant, the family sets out to California in a VW bus.  From the film's opening moments, with the memorable, poignant score and the dad (played by the underrated Kinnear) giving a motivational speech to a small, nearly empty room on his \\"9 Steps\\" to becoming a \\"winner,\\" it's obvious \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" could be something special.    To go into the details of each of the characters would be redundant, as most other reviews here seem to have that covered, but it's important to note that the entire cast shines.  Nobody's phoning it in here; the performances are heartfelt and genuine, and you'll find yourself caring about each member of the Hoover Family.  This is essential because much of the comedy stems from the characters and the dialogue.  Even the occassional moment of physical comedy (the way Carrell's character runs, for example), is subtle and character-based, and for that matter, effective.  Each character gets their moment in the sun, and \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is filled with memorable moments because of it.  Every scene in the movie doesn't just advance the plot or makes us laugh, it also reveals the nature of the characters.    \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" knows that most vacations don't turn out how you imagine, and that there are bound to be mishaps along the way--the car that breaks down, the run-ins with local authorities.  It's also wise enough to know that those mishaps are the moments you'll look back on with your family and laugh about, perhaps even cherish.     It all builds to one of the most rewarding and enjoyable payoffs in recent years.  This is a truly heartwarming movie that manages to charm and convey its message using dark humor and adult honesty, instead of through the sappiness or Hallmark sentiments of most Hollywood products. I haven't seen all the big films of 2006 (such as Babel, Letters from Iwo Jima, or Pan's Labyrinth), but \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" is one of those true crowd pleasers that appeal to both low and high brow audiences, and it's one of those movies that gets better with each viewing.  For that alone, I think \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" will be cherished long after this year's Babels are relegated to film history.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Gwenie Gwen is fantastic on this record!!!  Fund music.  Highly recommend
B000BI0WOA|4.0|This is a two CD package and lots of music.  If you like Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler in his own right - this purchase will keep you listening over & over for weeks.  Every song is great and I'm sure one will find several favorites.  I found 2 more CD's that I wanted after listening to a couple of tracks from this one.  Excellent buy.
B000EWBKM6|3.0|I was disappointed in this dvd.It seems like it has been slapped together for a quick profit.I know it isnt very expensive but I only bought it because I am a collector of the series,I wouldnt buy it just for entertainment.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|Amon Amarth is doing what they do best! Making great music! This album is great start to finish!
B000G6BJS0|4.0|Great collection of the Shostakovich symphonies.  Recording is clear; orchestra is dynamic.  Great program notes, too.  One of the best recordings of #15 that I have heard in a while.
B000002N25|4.0|Easy Listening music very Dire Straits style.  Excellent for listening to while working or entertaining.  A good addition to ones library of music. <br />
B00001W9G0|4.0|Arrived really quickly and I gave it away as a gift; I've heard no complaints so it must be in excellent condition.
0307237699|5.0|A good read with significant insight into the current state of the world. Occasionally presented from an ambitious viewpoint. We need more reasoned discourse about out current situation without everything reduced to soundbites, this is a great  example of the possibilities.
0800141660|5.0|This is one of the great movie ever, you won't regret if you decide to buy it, Emma Thompson and Ang Lee have made a perfect interpretation of the book's essence
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins motivation for this was to help sway those who are leaning away from the Delusion of God anyway.  Those who aren't under that delusion will agree.  I don't think it will convince those he targets however.  There might be a small percentage of people who he will give the courage, conviction and nudge to help them banish this delusion for what it is.   <br /> <br />The motivation Dawkins sets for himself is almost like that of a pamphlet church visitors leave in your screen door.  Yet you won't get someone to read a fair size book for that purpose unless they nearly are there anyway.  <br /> <br />But every little bit helps.  And he seems to have gotten lots of attention from a large number of people.  He argues his point well enough to speak for others out there no longer under the God Delusion. Seems something of a growing trend.  So maybe I am underestimating its effect in this sense.  Which is why I opted for 4 stars rather than just 3.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|If you are a Rambo kind of guy/gal, you will love this set.
B00006LI4S|4.0|Pulse is better. It was kind of boring but I still love Gilmour.
B000J3EEBY|2.0|sorry lorrenna, noit your best work. it is tired and overdone. remix her other albums and you get this one. not worth the money
B000I5X80G|3.0|While probably essential for Neil Young afficianados, this disc is overpriced for the amount of material.  Surely this set must have been considerably longer than the material presented.  If you are not a Neil Young fanatic, don't waste your money.
6304698526|5.0|This movie was for my husband. he was so excited when he received it.
B000J10ERO|5.0|Superman's back and it couldn't have come at a better time, after Chris and Danna's death the fans of Superman needed an uplifting movie that stuck true to Richard Donners vision, Singer pulled and exceded that. This brought a legend back to the screen, get this movie you'll love it.
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is a great review and interview of the creaters of Dark Side of the Moon. Many nice video clips of music interleaved with super interviews. No sniping or back biting - just fantastic visits with the musicians. <br />My kids caught a snippet of this on PBS and said, \\"Dad, you've gotta have this.\\" I'm really glad they discovered it.
0761925538|2.0|I have read the book and it is a formal structured discourse about how to do business cases.<br /><br />For academic researchers who have never been in a company, it can be helpful. But I have found it a little bit incomplete for those researchers who work in the arena, who have real contact with the companies.<br /><br />Any way, another link between the academic world and the business world
0767903862|4.0|I read \\"Walk in the Woods\\" years ago and think of it quite often. This one is just as good.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Although the songs don't add up to the cohesive artistic wholes that characterized this album's predecessors, Meatloaf and Jim Steinman have again achieved a remarkable and, at times, magical symbiosis. If you liked BOOH I or II, this album is a necessity.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I was never a fan of Celtic music until I listened to this album. Although, upon further perusal of this genre, I've come to understand that Celtic Woman is far more mainstream than other artists, the voices of these women (not to mention the sound of Mairead's violin) are nevertheless incredible. Their covers of \\"May It Be,\\" \\"Orinoco Flow,\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" are welcome additions to an otherwise folklore-dominated album, though by no means do songs like \\"Siúil a Rún,\\" \\"The Butterfly,\\" and \\"Sí Do Mhaimeo Í\\" pale in comparison. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this album to anyone looking to dip their feet into the Celtic genre, as it showcases some of the more traditional songs and also provides some mainstream tunes.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My family has loved this game.  It is so easy that the whole family can play together and enjoy.   I definitely recommend it.
0446672653|5.0|This is another wonderful book by Dr. Brian Weiss explaining that we have all been here before and that we will be here again.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock is \\"the master\\", & Rear Window a shining jewel in the crown of his career!  Jiimy Stewart & Grace Kelly are perfect pairing.  He's your every guy, she's the very defination of class & style.  Thelma Ritter rounds out the outstanding trio of \\"peeping toms\\", with Raymond \\"Perry Mason\\" \\"Ironside\\" Burr like you've never seen him in the courtroom. When watching Rear Window you're there, looking out the window with them. Involving, suspensful, and also insightflul in the way we learn, along with the characters, lessons from looking in the private windows of others. Well-written, great set, and oh those gorgeous outfits Grace Kelly wears! No movie collection is complete with out Hitchcock, and no Hitchcock collection is complete with Rear Window.  Recommend DVD Widescreen Collector's Edition from Universal.
B00002SWEM|5.0|A musician's story.  All factual and carefully done, showing a gathering of Cuban jazz greats after many years of not performing.  Good photography, interesting scenes and good music.  They still play!  Well done!
B000I0QK74|5.0|I love this CD. It is going in my Christmas box for next year!! The duet with <br /> Ms. King Cole is fabulous. My wife and I danced to it through out the holidays!! BUY IT!!!
0553588486|3.0|I wish I had read more reviews before buying this, although it was cheap enough. As numerous other reviewers pointed out, this is NOT a traditional fantasy book. Martin teases you at the very start, with cool monsters  called the others and an extended fight scene, but then no more creatures are seen for the rest of the considerable 800 page book! Also, there is NO MAGIC whatsoever. That is a fact.<br /><br />The whole book is about court intrigues and treachery and who belongs on what throne and who is the true heir and so on.<br /><br />If you like that sort of thing, this is a good book because Martin admittedly is a good writer. Another problem is too many characters. There is an appendix in the back to try to keep track of them all but it doesn't help much. TOO MANY characters, and not enough action. If you want a fantasy with magic, sorcery and dragons and monsters this is NOT the book for you. If you would like a historical tale of what life might have been like in the middle ages with warring kings then you will love this book. I wish Martin had written a more traditional fantasy book.<br /><br /> As a side note, I highly recommend getting hold of his short story \\"Unsound variations\\", it is great!
6305922756|5.0|Christopher Guest <br />Harry Shearer <br /> <br />that's pretty much all you need to know......Ed Begly's cameo is priceless!! <br /> <br />ROCK ON DUDES!!!-Bloody good YO
B00004RF83|5.0|I found this to be a great movie.  I had never heard of it before ordering.  It is about government conspiracy before conspiracy theories became popular.
B000002NJS|5.0|If you don't like this album, even a little bit, then there is something serously wrong with you.  Every song is amazing.  The entire album is an art piece...performance art on a CD.  An artistic triumph!  <br /> <br />That said, her second best is \\"Music\\" tied with \\"Bedtime Stories\\", both excellent.  Then it's all down hill from there until you get to \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", where she tries to get to get her groove back but only half way succeeds.
B000002N25|1.0|I am a big fan since the Dire Straits days but It seemed like he was trying for a different sound, which is OK but I fiund it trite & slightly annoying.
0800141849|5.0|This film could be associated with many families, as a matter of fact the story and the caracters have a lot of similarities with my clan....A very enjoyable story with lots of meanings to it.Excellent and very worth while movie to see; I recomend it.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I know others have called this record a gimmick or just a \\"mix.\\" But I think this goes far beyond that. It is sheer genius. Sir George Martin and son have really created a masterpiece of Beatles music. Every time I listen to it (which is very often) I hear new sounds that I have never heard before. And I remember exactly where I was when I heard Sgt. Pepper's for the first time! The blend of different songs is so compatible and yet different, hauntingly so, it seems almost strange that these are original tracks, and yet so typically Beatles....a real tribute the timelessness of the Beatles musical legacy.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This DVD will bring to any audience the enjoyment of the holiday season!
0671027387|1.0|Put simply, \\"Deception Point\\" is a poorly written book with the dialogue of a bad video game. I was willing to forgive that, expecting an exciting and suspenseful thriller. Unfortunately, this book lags through cliche and inconsequential character back stories, relentless technical jargon, and constant plot summarizations through inner monologues. Furthermore, Dan Brown's claim that all the technology described is real, makes the many technical inaccuracies and fantasies kind of pathetic. I never knew massive government coverups, aliens, and government assasins could be so boring.
B000I5X81K|2.0|I think Josh Groban has tremendous talent but his recordings only show us a narrow part of this talent. Pairing with Lady Smith was a good start. Honestly,it's why I bought the CD. FINALLY, a new sound!Now, would they please add some uptempo songs?
6303109950|5.0|In spite of living in Arizona, I did not have much of a historical view of the Gunfight at the OK Corral, even though I visited Tombstone.  (My only information was a Star Trek episode and a series in the comic strip \\"Mandrake The Magician\\", which both make no historical claims.)  So I watched \\"Wyatt Earp\\" and now \\"Tombstone\\".  By the way, the day I watched \\"Tombstone,\\" there was a Bizarro cartoon titled \\"Gunfight At The OK Chorale.\\"<br /><br />For those who want to get to the gist, I will say that I think \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is probably more accurate historically, but I found \\"Tombstone\\" much more entertaining.  Where \\"Tombstone\\" succeeds over \\"Wyatt Earp\\":<br /><br />1.  The Gunfight is more exciting.<br /><br />2.  Kurt Russell's Wyatt is more likeable and identifiable with than Kevin Costner's.<br /><br />3.  The villains are more dastardly here.<br /><br />4.  The friendship between Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday is better developed here.<br /><br />5.  The ending does not drag, and is more satisfying.<br /><br />The only things that are better about \\"Wyatt Earp\\":  Mare Winningham's portrayal of Mattie (Earp's deserted, alcoholic wife) is light years ahead of Dana Wheeler-Nicholson's, and Linden Ashby is a more vibrant Morgan Earp.  As far as the portrayals of Doc Holiday, Val Kilmer's here and Dennis Quaid's in \\"Wyatt Earp\\" are equal.<br /><br />Now, for those who want a more in-depth comparison, here goes:<br /><br />1.  \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is more concerned with the life of Earp, while \\"Tombstone\\" is concerned with the gunfight, the events leading up to it, and the aftermath (though \\"Wyatt Earp\\" touches on the trial of the Earps and Holiday, while \\"Tombstone\\" does not).  Thus, the longer \\"Wyatt Earp\\" spends half of its time looking at Earp before his arrival at Tombstone.  Also, \\"Tombstone\\" does not deal with the Earps struggles as businessmen before returning to being lawmen.<br /><br />2.  \\"Tombstone\\" introduces the equivalent of the mafia with \\"The Cowboys\\".  Ike Clanton here is only a henchman with Curly Bill Brocious (Powers Boothe) and Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) being the chief villains and gang ring-leaders.  While there is clear opposition to the Earps in \\"Wyatt Earp\\", the cowboys are not as developed.<br /><br />3.  \\"Wyatt Earp\\" starts off with Wyatt waiting for his brothers to tell him what the Clantons are up to, and then leading them to the gunfight.  \\"Tombstone\\" has Wyatt being very reluctant to get into the law-keeping business, with Virgil (excellently portrayed by Sam Elliott) and Morgan proceeding him.  Also, in \\"Tombstone\\" it is Virgil who leads the heroes march to the OK Corral.<br /><br />4.  The relationship between Mattie and Wyatt is not as detailed here as in \\"Wyatt Earp.\\"  Likewise, Wyatt is more of the instigator of the adulterous affair with Josephine Marcus in \\"Wyatt Earp\\", while Dana Delaney's interpretation has Marcus being more of a seductress.  As a result of these two items, \\"Tombstone\\" makes Wyatt a little more forgivable than in \\"Wyatt Earp,\\" because it makes him more of a victim, and Mattie less sympathetic.  Also, the ending of \\"Tombstone\\" mentions Mattie's death, which \\"Wyatt Earp\\" does not.<br /><br />5.  On the subject of women, Holiday's girlfriend Kate (here, played by Joanna Pacula) is better looking than her \\"Wyatt Earp\\" counterpart.<br /><br />If you want history and don't mind being a little bored, get \\"Wyatt Earp\\".  But if you want an enjoyable and entertaining adventure, get this one!!!  And when you plan on watching this movie, why not get ready by stopping at the grocery store, and get some pizza first.  What kind of pizza?  Tombstone, of course.go (Michael Biehn) being the chief villains and gang ring-leaders.

B000J3EEBY|4.0|Loreena picks up right where The Book of Secrets left off, incorporating Middle Eastern/Central Asian melodies and unique instruments into her music. She barely plays her harp on this album, instead opting for exotic instruments like the oud and bouzouki. They provide the nasal Silk Road sound that McKennitt has been incorporating on her albums since The Mask and Mirror.  <br /> <br />There are nine tracks on this album, which I would divide into three types: three Middle Asian tracks, three popular tracks, and three more Western-sounding ballads.  <br /> <br />Middle Asian tracks: \\"The Gates of Istanbul\\" is snake-charmer music. It's a slow and simple melody with successively higher tones that build into a low climax, then repeats. McKennitt's voice sways up and down, pulling you in.  <br /> <br />\\"Sacred Sabbat\\" is, well, not my favorite on the album. It a lively reel(?) that would be at home during a Jewish wedding. On her website, Loreena corrects and error.  She did not write the music -- the melody is tradtional. <br /> <br />\\"Kecharitomene\\" is a piece much like \\"Marco Polo\\" from The Book of Secrets, the sort of traveling nomad music I've come to expect from McKennitt. It's a two-part melody that builds with more and more instruments and harmonies. The best moment of the song, and one of the highlights of An Ancient Muse, is that moment of dead silence just before the main themes are played with the full range of orchestration. Listen for the full stop just before her band goes nuts. <br /> <br />The popular-sounding tracks are \\"Caravanserai,\\" and \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\" (which incorporates the \\"Incantation.)\\" Forgive me Loreena, but in both songs, you out-Yanni Yanni. Although the melodies are good, they are bland enough that they are not too catchy.  They are difficult to remember until you've listened to them 5-6 times.  McKennitt also lays a constant synthesizer base to both songs, especially \\"Phrygian,\\" making it even more homogenous. I tend to prefer acoustic music, where the spaces between musical layers give a crisper sound. But Phrygian is all full and fuzzy. It incorporates a soft drumbeat which makes it sound like a ballad from the 1980's. The song sounds like Wham's \\"Careless Whisper,\\" or background music from Miami Vice. Seriously, it makes me want to put on a pastel linen suit. :-o The lyrics to \\"Beneath a Phrygian Sky\\" are a little more obvious than McKennitt usually allows. Should I wear a \\"message\\" T-shirt under that linen suit?  <br /> <br />It is in the Western ballad tracks that McKennitt really shines. In \\"The English Ladye and the Knight,\\" McKennitt sets a classic Sir Walter Scott poem to music. The melody is not strong or catchy, you can't dance to it. But I'm sure that that is McKennitt's intention. The Scott poem is set a thousand years ago, and McKennitt writes a melody to match -- something a traveling minstral would play at court a thousand years ago. Her choral orchestration brings up visions of old churches with saints tiled into the stained-glass windows.  <br /> <br />\\"Penelope's Song\\" is the type of slow, simple sparsely accompanied ballad that I love to listen to. The nickylharpe (SP?) fits in well here. <br /> <br />But is the last track that really has pulled me into this album. \\"The Never Ending Road\\" is a real showcase of McKennitt's voice, accompanied by uilleann pipes and strings. Her verses talk of things like hedgerows and snow, but her refrain is starkly honest; no metaphors in the poetry here. In the liner notes, McKennitt says she is inspired by those who try to reflect the divine through love poetry.  You just want to cry with her. I keep skipping to this song on the CD. <br /> <br />Now, the important question. Is this album any good? First off, I should say that a McKennitt album is always, ALWAYS worth the money. Even an average McKennitt album puts the entire Billboard music awards to shame. You won't be asking to have 54 minutes of your life back after listening to it. This album is very much what one would expect from a Mckennitt: no overarching album sound (unlike 99% of the artists out there). Each song is unique, and each in itself is worth the price of admission. But, because the three types of songs on this album are so different (IMO), it's hard to say if someone would or would not like the entire album. All her melodies are solid, as are her all arrangements (you have to conjure up John Tesh for a couple of them). It just depends if you like the style and sound of the music.  I have to admit I listen to this album for the ballads. I can take or leave her Middle Eastern instrumental sounds, but musically there's nothing wrong with them.  <br /> <br />If I can find one criticism, it's this: Loreena, lay off the keyboards and synthesizer! Her Yanni-Tesh tunes would have sounded so much better had they been acoustic. Leave the synth to the musicians that need electronica like a crutch (Enya). Loreena's music - not to mention her voice! -- is strong enough to hold up a capella, no need to hide behind echo chambers or computers. Please Loreena, go back to your harp and your nearly acoustic music.

B000000WG4|1.0|Please listen again to this album, like me, before you hear it again, you might say, \\"what a great album\\". Now listen to it and see how this is just a collage of unfinished work that is going nowhere.  The end of the first part, that run for nearly for 7-8 minutes, playing the same muscial part, with different instrument, with the voice of somebody telling you which instrument it is...what a joke ! Highly overrated. Is Mike Oldfield is good at any at the instrument he plays ? I found him very poor in fact.  Honestly, many of my friends are better that this and they are pure no name !  Horrible album, overrated and boring from the beginnig to the end.
B000002L9J|5.0|Originality.   <br /> <br />So many artists seek, or even claim, to be doing something original, something different, something special, something unique.  Yet few artists in the history of popular music attained a level of originality that matched that of the Smiths.  Morrissey (vocals), Johnny Marr (guitars), Andy Rourke (bass) & Mike Joyce (drums) brought together a variety of disparate elements--a love of rockabilly, golden-era pop, classic rock, and a healthy dose of punk--to create something beautiful and new, strange but familiar, fleeting and for all time.  <br /> <br />_The Queen Is Dead_ is their masterpiece. <br /> <br />Morrissey and Marr produced the album themselves, surrounding the listener in warm sheets of guitars with a solid layer of bass and drums underneath.  Morrissey's voice is right where it should be, not over the top of the mix, but truly stabbing its way right through the music, with lyrics as brutal and as honest as a knife.   <br /> <br />Indeed, throughout the album, Morrissey is on the attack, slicing away at the monarchy (\\"The Queen Is Dead\\"), business associates (\\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly\\"), social ideals about physical desire (\\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\"), the institution of marriage (\\"I Know It's Over\\"), plagiarists (\\"Cemetry Gates\\"), and organized religion (\\"Vicar In A Tutu\\").  The blade also turns on its owner, as Morrissey dissects his own lonliness (\\"Never Had No One Ever\\"), his troubled childhood (\\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\"), and the very act of verbal expression itself (\\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\"). <br /> <br />The Smiths provide the perfect musical atmosphere for each of these lyrical worlds, be it the frantic, powerful rock of \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again,\\" the heart-breaking balladry of \\"I Know It's Over,\\" the folky, breezy jangle of \\"Cemetry Gates,\\" or the manic, spitting punk of the title track. <br /> <br />And then, there is the penultimate track, the album's climax, and arguably one of the most gorgeously tragic moments in all of popular music:  \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out.\\"  The guitars chime and glisten like the lights of a late night highway.  The bass and drums keep driving forward, pushing and searching.  All the while, Morrissey, ever-reaching, always-yearning, demands (\\"take me out tonight / where there's music and there's people / and they're young and alive\\"), reveals (\\"driving in your car / I never never want to go home / because I haven't got one / anymore\\"), despairs (\\"and in the darkened underpass / I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last / but then a strange fear gripped me and I / just couldn't ask\\"), and hopes (\\"and if a double-decker bus / crashes into us / to die by your side / is such a heavenly way to die\\"). <br /> <br />If you can't feel this music, this moment, there might not be blood running through your veins.
6305897786|4.0|Just watched this for the 2nd time on IFC. I won't repeat what others already have said. The actors (esp. Depp) were routinely excellent. The road trip scenery throughout Europa was especially welcome and set the tone so marvellously. Some of the editing seemed rather abrupt although. In certain scenes where the veil was puilling back ever so slightly - bam - scene changed. My other issue was certain parts of the soundtrack seemed out of place. While the mood was dark and slow throughout, as was the music, abruptly at times (the chase along the Seine) segued into action film stereotypical. <br /> <br />I'm afraid I still have questions about the female lead's identity, but the film works nicely both ways. The ending thus is totally up to the interpretation of the viewer. Don't expect special effects and demons, do expect a wonderfully engrossing film based on the performances and pacing of the film. The juxtapositions presented to the viewer are mind candy. Enjoy and turn the lights down low...

0689877692|5.0|I purchased this book for my 4 year old, but when he unwrapped it and set it aside to go on to the next gift, the book was quickly picked up by the other adults in the room.  They were absolutely fascinated by the gorgeous paper sculptures in the book.  They oohed and ahhed over them, and looked the book over several times before they relinquished the book to the next curious adult.<br /><br />Superficially, the book is a counting book where the reader tries to find one red dot in the middle of \\"eight obedient orbs\\", etc..  However, the book is ultimately a work of art.  The paper sculptures are are abstract and interactive, and completely stunning.  I'm a fan of Sabuda's pop-up books, but I just love the playful abstract nature of this book.<br /><br />My four year old finally got his book back, and he, too, loves it and reads it every night before bed.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and enjoy it every time I watch it.  Our country was a Christian nation at that time in our history and honored it's young men who were willing to serve their country.  It's is so sad to see what has happened to our wonderful nation, when everything must be politically correct.  Our young men and women in military service are not honored by our liberal media, but they are honored by the common men and women who make up the majority in our country - we just need to make the majority heard.  Anyway, Gary Cooper was great as were all the others.  Be sure to buy this movie so that you can watch it again and again!

B00008972S|1.0|Although it's logo was extensively used in the package, and the brazilian version includes a copy of the original poster designed by Saul Bass, the great american graphic designer of credits, titles and visual consultant was TOTALLY IGNORED in this edition. The beautiful starting (with use of changing musical themed \\"colors\\", the graphic rendition of a revealing Manhathan and title lettering) and the breathtaking ending credits, with the camera patiently panning through grafitti hand scratched and painted letterings on a sensitive film related enviroment really deserve a comment. There's some photos of the making-of even on the internet. (See also Bass own comments on his documentary \\"Bass on Titles\\" part of SHORTS 11 - Ectasy). However, MGM don't get ashamed of displaying a poor imitation of Saul's \\"graphic style\\" (sic) in the DVDs menu, beyond the weird \\"animated trailer\\" probably the first abuse commited by MGM of the gorgeous identity developed for the film by Saul Bass. But, what intriges me most, is the fact that his participation as visual consultant remains a mistery. Shame on you, MGM!

630512762X|5.0|An excellent non-stop action movie.  One can definitely tell old Johnny Wu did this one.  If you like guns, shooting, and macho mindless bloodshed, I have to say this movie is a must see.  Cage and Travolta, after seeing this movie, are the ONLY ones that gave this film what it has.
B000F0UUT6|4.0|This reproduction of Pride and Prejudice is the best I have ever seen.  It is somewhat long, originally aired as (6) TV mini-series movies, played one after the other, but is quite worth it!  Colin Firth plays an excellent Darcy (much like many of the other characters he plays).  Jennifer Ehle is a fantastic Elizabeth full of wit and energy.  All the supporting actors are true to the image as well.  The book included in this set is interesting and full of fun facts.   <br /> <br />If you are a Jane Austen fan, this movie is a must, (however you may want to just purchase the regular boxed set instead of the Collectors Edition).
0307341542|2.0|Intriguing book, with a cutter who's not quite a full-blown Borderline Personality Disorder, as most are not. There was a great mother character (not overdone), but daughters not quite up to her intensity in libris and in vivo. I thought the plot was logical, but not quite fully credible. I also felt this writer needed some work on heterosexual interpersonal dynamics; the boy- girl schema was a little flat and undirected. If you find a copy in your rental villa, go ahead and open it.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Very exciting movie. Well acted (Natalie Portman is great in this), well written, and very well directed. If you want to have a crazy time, watch this. Recomended.

0312995423|4.0|Digital Fortress is Dan Brown's first novel and a best seller.  Brown is, of course, the author of the Da Vinci Code, the wordwide best seller and international phenomenon.  If you've read Da Vinci Code and are checking out Brown's other work, then this is a novel I highly recommend.  Digital Fortress is set at the NSA, America's National Security Agency.  NSA has created a computer called TRNSLTR that can break any encrypted email in the world, even though the world doesn't know it.  This allows the NSA to snoop on condemning emails sent by terrorists and criminals.  TRNSLTR can usually break codes in a few minutes, however, one day it encounters a code that it has taken over 15 hours and still hasn't been able to break.<br /><br />The NSA deputy director Trevor Strathmore calls in Susan Fletcher to help him find out what to do.  Fletcher is Strathmore's star employee, a woman rising in the ranks of a male dominated work force.  At the same time, Fletcher's fiance David Becker is sent to Spain to track down a code that may be the key to the problems TRSNLTR is having.  The story alternates between Becker's chase for the code in Spain and Fletcher's efforts to figure out the secret to the unbreakable code.  Other plotlines come in, such as a Japanese programmer Ensai Tankado who may have discovered the unbreakable code and his hatred for NSA, the disgruntled NSA employee Brad Hale who may have secrets of his own, the all-powerful NSA director, and an assassin hired by an unknown person who is on Becker's trail the entire novel.<br /><br />This novel is eight years old so the technology is obviously out of date.  I wouldn't know if the tecnological parts of the novel were accurate or not, so that's not something I can comment on.  I do believe Brown did his homework and attempted to write an accurate portrayal of the NSA.  Technical details aside, you can see glimpses of the Brown signatures.  Historical settings, detailed research and a lot of twists and turns. (I happened to like all of Brown's novels, except the Da Vinci Code, which I found to be very boring).  For fans of Brown, the Da Vinci Code, or thrillers in general, this is a book I recommend you pick up.(I happened to like all of Brown's novels, except the Da Vinci Code, which I found to be very boring).

B000244FDW|1.0|Okay movie...poor film quality. Later remakes are much better.
B000HEZF0E|5.0|I saw this in the retail store for close to $100!  I got it here at a fraction of the price, and that makes the viewing experience even better!  This is some of Tom's best work, even before going a little nuts... I have to say the MI3 is by far my favorite of the set, and the picture is astounding in HD, but what really blew me away is the SOUND quality; every bullet shell, every explosion, every fight scene; the Dolby is undeniable.  I highly recomend this set for anyone that loves action flicks, and enjoys the quality of HD.
0783240287|1.0|I used to have the album - and as well performed it in chorus when I was a teenager.  I loved my old album.  I had read the reviews - and changed my mind based on the reviews - I probably should have kept with the version I thought I previously had - which likely was the original.  I listened to bits and pieces - but just did not enjoy it and won't likely listen to it again.  I was so disapointed in the CD that I have not watched the Video yet.  If you have long ago memories of how great this was - this might not be the version for you??
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I still love Amy Lee's voice, and Call Me When You're Sober is a great song, but the rest sort of just blends together.  Not as many \\"hits\\" as the first CD.  You can definitely tell that she is glad to be out of her last relationship.  It's important to read the lyrics to get a real feel for the mood of this CD.  They are a great band and I'm ready for their next CD.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|When I ordered this CD, I hemmed and hawed for a little while thinking I was gonna get burned with something I didn't like. After hearing Someday Baby on the radio, I decided to buy Dylan's latest. I was pleasantly surprised. The songs have a bluesy and country and folksy feel to them. The album sounds much different than the older Dylan I was used to. I'd say I love 7 out of the 10 songs and that's a pretty good batting average for an album.
0060254920|5.0|When I was a little girl I was given a copy of this book by my favorite aunt.  I instantly fell in love with it, and even to this day, at the age of 38, I still read this book once in awhile. <br /> <br />Now it is a tradition for me to give every new baby that my friends, or family, have a copy of this book on their first Christmas.  I always have a few copies up in the gift cupboard, just in case.   <br /> <br />I think every kid should have a copy of this book in their library.  It is a classic, and the illustrations are just wonderful.   <br /> <br />BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR CHILD NOW!!!!
B00005LC1H|2.0|If Santa Claus is coming to town, Basil Fawlty is on his best behavior. If not, he's like you or me. Or is he? <br /> <br />Fawlty Towers is a comedy series about man and wife who run a self-named hotel. The hotel seems nice enough, though in need of a few repairs. They have a staff of two- a man from Barcelona who speaks very little English and a young blond woman whose beauty is what is attracts the most attention. John Cleese as Basil Fawlty is the main character and it's his sarcastic humor, his immense groveling and his pie-in-the-face antics that define the comedy of this series. It's British, it's backwards, and it has made me laugh because it's so basic. <br /> <br />But then again, it's not all clean humor. There are sexual references and innuendo that make me squirm watching it with my young ones (the wedding party). It does, also, cross the line into peeking and groping, though for seemingly innocent reasons (the psychiatrist). Our kids are not allowed to watch an episode that we haven't screened. After watching this first episode listed above, we waited 6 weeks (after the Christmas season) to screen anymore. Last night, we screened two, one of them being the latter listed above.  <br /> <br />I find the sexual humor offensive. As a teen, I laughed while watching, but had nightmares afterwards. That was in the days before taping where shows weren't pre-screened and offensive material couldn't be skipped through the magic of fast forward or scene selection.  <br /> <br />My recommendation is to watch with a friend who knows which episodes to avoid, if you can find such a friend. And then screen, screen, screen before allowing the kids to watch. Some of it will be over their heads, but watch out, because some memories will stick with them long after Fawlty Towers has been closed for repairs.
B000002JSR|5.0|Despite the fact that this album is leftover tracks over the course of Led Zeppelin's career, the 8 tracks are excellent, and this album has a coherent feel despite being recorded over a period of 8 years or so.  I find that remarkable.  Led Zeppelin shows the world how great they were/are with this album.  It's an album of rejected songs, and it's stil better than most of the drek out today (and even back in Zeppelin's heyday).  The only other artists who have great \\"rejected\\" songs are Bob Dylan and Frank Zappa.  There isn't a wasted track here.  I really like the killer riff from Walter's Walk, the scorching We're Gonna Groove, and the insane I Can't Quit You Baby (which is superior to the version on Led Zeppelin I).  Despite having a mere 8 tracks and just over a half hour long, you should pick this up.  It's not Zeppelin's best or anything, but the 8 tracks are still damn good for leftovers.
B000GFLE86|5.0|I have long been a fan of MP and this album is as smooth and lovely as the others I own.
1878424319|5.0|Whether you have your \\"stuff\\" together or you need some real help making sense of life this is an excellent book for any age.  It's the type you'll keep on your shelf to refer to again and again. <br /> <br />I've given it to probably twenty different people...it's just an awesome gift!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A must see for everyone. The information conveyed is crucial for understanding the danger facing our planet and humanity. Our grandchildren will blame us for not acting while there was a chance to avert disaster.
B000G759LW|5.0|This Cd should get 10 stars! Its a 2 disc cd and this girl has talent. Christina has shown on every cd that she has come out with that she can sing and do most any style. This cd shows a new, yet old style. I really enjoyed it. My two favs: Candyman and Hurt.  <br />You'll love it!
B000I5X81K|5.0|His voice!  It is a great mix of his own and others.  Definately very diverse.
B000H305U0|4.0|I thought this cd was going to be a lot better than what it is. I have to say, I was kind of disappointed. Maybe I'm just new to Justin Timberlake style, but I'm still trying to warm up to it. There are the few songs that I, I'm sure like everyone else, really like because we hear them on the radio, but the others....Not too sure about yet.
0743454537|5.0|Wow, it has been years since i have read a book so powerful and moving that i cried for hours. This book tells the story of a young girl, Anna,  trying to discover who she is but who is hampered by the fact she was created to provide parts for her sister. Her sister,Kate, has leukemia and is going to die (sonner rather than later) unless Anna gives Kate one of her kidneys. Anna refuses and decides to fight for medical emancipation from her parents. The bond of the two sisters is amazing. The alternating chapters with views from different characters gives this book a deeper look ito a family that wants both their daughters to live but in reality they know only one can live and the other must die to save her. The end is bitter sweet so don't read it unless you are at home with a giant box of tissues. This book is wonderfully written and i absolutely will loved it.
0743243307|3.0|Although it was interesting to read about the Indian community in England post 9-11, I could not connect to the characters as I usually could.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie makes me laugh so hard I almost cry every time I see it. It is certainly one of the most funny movies ever... A super young and pleasantly hunky Tom Hanks shines as always demonstrating his undeniable talent for light stories. The whole plot and the impossible situations this poor couple is subjected to when trying to repair their new acquired home in the outskirts are beyond anything. I truly recommend it.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|For anyone with an interest in the time of the Crusades - this movie provides some insight as to the beginnings on the conflicts between Islam and the west that still impact the world today.  An excellent performance by the entire cast. The movie does get slow from time-to-time (It is ~4 hours long!), but the overall pace, action and acting is done well enough to keep your interest.  This movie provides some of the best combat scenes of this age since Braveheart and Gladiator, and provides the same epic scenes reminiscent of Spartacus, Ben-Hur and Cleopatra.  I highly recommend this as a part of anyone's action movie collection.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I like the 1st album more, but that 1st album is hard to top!!!  Still, this 2nd album is almost as good and it does grow on you.  If you're an Evanescence fan, you gotta get The Open Door.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Nowhere near the caliber of the first Bats, but still better and more intense  and melodic than anything else you will buy out there for a while on the rock charts.  Lyrically not as imaginative or moving and the piano licks are almost non-existant while the guitar lines (with a few powerful exceptions) lack the melodic riffs that propelled the previous Bats, settling for simple sustained bombastic chords, like generic 'modern-rock.'  It is too bad he couldn't get bluesy soloistic Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, as he had intended, to give this album a distinctive, memorable, melodic voice on guitar. <br /> <br />Meat's voice is much more impressive than expected.  He really will blow you away with the power and pitch of some of his notes.  A man of his age and past shouldn't be able to do the things Meat does, but meat does it better, and with more sincerity, than most performer half his age would.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|IMO, The Polar Express is simply THE BEST animated movie to date!!!  The detail is simply stunning!!  What more can I say.....
B00005JL0I|4.0|I purchased this DVD for the added black and white 1954 original version of Casino Royale. I was very pleased with the 1954 version. The main movie was ridiculous in my opinion.
B000267JQK|3.0|Just an ok album, but a must have if you want Broken with Amy Lee.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|This CD rocks! I have been a big fan of Huey Lewis and I never realised it until this CD. Sure I have known known of some Huey Lewis songs... but when I popped in this CD I reconized practially ever songs and didn't reallize they were all Huey Lewis... I am thinking of starting a HL coverband called \\"Screwey Dewey and the Infomercials\\"... Have to stop typing and listen to the CD!
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I guess if you're a diehard Matrix fan, Revolutions will be a must have.  IMO, Revolutions is just more of the same.  I'm not suggesting Revolutions is necessarily bad, but other than an ending, I don't think it adds anything to the story.  Then again, an ending is a good thing.  I don't understand why this series is rated R tho??
0618680004|5.0|Someone needs to write a screenplay based on this book so maybe it stands a chance to inform the people it most needs to affect. Or perhaps a sit-com? Better yet, a reality-based TV show. <br /> <br />Best book I've read in years.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|A good X-Men movie, not as good as the 1st movie, but better than the 2nd movie.  The choice of main movie characters has always seemed odd to me, and this continues in Last Stand.  At least Rogue plays a very small roll in Last Stand - which is good because she is one of the weakest characters ever!!  Overall tho, Last Stand is a fine finish(?) to the X-Men trilogy.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Even though its past the holidays, make sure you pick this one up for next year. The whole family loves this comedy. Will does a great job!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Both discs at the price of one?  Nothing more needs to be said!
B000ICM5VW|5.0|If you get an error message when you play the HD DVD version of King Kong or Miami Vice, call Toshiba's customer service number and request the firmware update CD. It cleared up all the problems on my machine.
6305897786|5.0|It has been on of the most clear and interesting movies I have seen in a long time, finally one that has a bit of substance to it. <br /> <br />Best movie Ive seen this year, I would recomend this movie to those who have an interest in the \\"different\\" side of things.

B000002TQB|4.0|Parklife is a fantastic album, it really is. The songs are all impeccably well-crafted, the lyrics are clever without being full of themselves, and the playing is peerless. Opening track \\"Boys & Girls\\" is a wonderful dance track, finding the mid ground between Britpop and Hip-Hop (Kind of. I just liked how they rhyme). The only downside to the album is a matter of location. Starting with their second album, Modern Life is Rubbish, blur were known for their ability to capture the feelings and emotions of the time and place where they were. Parklife is revered as Mid-90's England captured in song, and while I like the album very much, I feel like I missed something because I didn't hear it in it's own time. A small grief, but a grief none the less.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|OK, I love Sandra Bullock (she's had \\"work done\\", sigh - I hope it losens up a bit), I found the story line enjoyable - a touch of science fantasy made it an interesting plot.  The side plots were obviously thrown in to add length to the movie and were rather trite.  As for Keanu, I don't believe he can act and he should stick to things like The Matrix.   <br /> <br />However, I gave it 4 stars, because even with the major flaws, I enjoyed it and would watch it again - that being a key rating factor for me.  Also, the ending actually came as a surprise to me - I can usually figure those out after the first 5 minutes or so.  And the hospital parts of the movie were good.  It's the Keanu's dad subplot that flops.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I have now seen every filmed version of this, the Jane Austin masterpiece, and have loved almost every version, because no matter the actors, the love story, as it overcomes pride and replaces prejudice is eternal. The original film was the only big disappointment--but my father, who was an English teacher, loved it.  The \\"insufferably noble Greer Garson\\" as Pauline Kael called her looked more like Mrs. Bennet than Lizzie, but Sir Laurence Olivier certainly made a handsome if somewhat earnest Mr. Darcy.  In one BBC version, Judy Parfitt played the most imperious Lady Catherine and in the last BBC performance Colin Firth made men's and women's hearts beat as the truly inscrutible and mysterious Darcy.  However, this film has its own blessings. <br /> <br />To begin with the Bennet household looks more like the eighteenth century truth of country living than the prettier versions.  Jane is truly vapid in appearance while sweet and trusting on an intimate basis and deserves the incredibly rich and awkward Bingley.  The other Bennet daughters are irritatingly silly and Brenda Blethyn is good--although I have seen more harried and neurotic performances.  But the Lizzie of Keira Knightley and the Darcy of Macfadyen are such that there can not be a dry seat in the house at the film's conclusion.  The impish nature of Knightley and the incredibly haughty disdain of Macfadyen make the final pairing something to long for, since it seems so unattainable.  Their youthful sexuality and the characters' cast iron personalities are lusty and appealing and their \\"climax\\" scene, in the pouring rain, in a verdant English garden is charged with emotion and longing--especially on the part of the viewer.  It should be pointed out that they are standing in a palladian \\"folly\\" in the garden which makes a delightful subtitle to their recognition scene.  Judy Dench chews up everything and everyone except Keira and is unfortunately denied some of her best lines when she has her final confrontation with Lizzie.  She would have delivered them in full throat throttle.  But these are insignificant notes to a beautiful production.  Lizzie and Darcy meeting on a foggy meadow is the stuff of romance and with these two actors the sexuality crackles like lightning. <br /> <br />If you have seen the other versions of this film, please see this one to make the experience complete.  If you have never seen a version of this film, this is a great film to begin with--and then work your way backwards.  As for me and Jane Austin, Lizzie says it best when speaking of her obsequious cousin who is living on Lady Catherine's gifts: \\"I am sure that her blessings could not have been bestowed on a more grateful subject.\\"
6304712936|5.0|Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that \\"Amadeus\\" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these \\"monsters with green eyes\\" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...<br /><br />Once again, \\"Amadeus\\" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.<br /><br />Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young
B0000JCFPE|4.0|I'd got this as a present for Christmas, although my mum already had it, but she has a thing for Michael Douglas. *Bleurgh* I'd never had much of an incline to watch it with my mum, and after watching it, I've decided it's probably not a good idea to watch it with my mum!<br /><br />Basic Instinct has two major horrible points for me. Any scenes featuring Michael - which was the majority of the film unfortunately - shaking his bare booty. I'd already been scarred for life by that image in Fatal Attraction, and you do see a lot more of it in this film. Not pleasant.<br /><br />My other horrible point, but not so much a horrible point, more of a statement, is of course, the infamous leg crossing scene. I'd never really seen it in any clips or anything, but had heard enough about it. Surprisingly, it happens quite early on in the film. I thought it would have happened at least half way through. This scene was unbelievable. It probably spawned a generation of men who remember having some pleasure to that scene. But my quibble, as a woman, is there's not much there to see! It's more letting your imagination run wild. For me, there wasn't much interest, but I can imagine there are plenty of pre-teen/early teenage boys out there, who have watched that scene over and over. The first shot you see the crease of her legs in the middle (nothing more), and the second shot, you definitely don't see much more than the very top, and it doesn't look like she shaved! That's it though. All the hype about that one scene. There was also a huge hoo-ha that Sharon CLAIMS she had no idea Paul Verhoeven was filming that particular area in the interrogation scene, and when she saw the rushes, she slapped him, and ordered him to remove it. Without that scene, I don't think the film would have got so much publicity, and might have died a death. Paul Verhoeven denies the above ever happened. But I like the fact that at the start of the scene, the policemen are in charge, then she opens her legs, and they turn into drooling idiots. Talk about turning the tables.<br /><br />I was instantly put off by how much I hated that scene, and was about to change my mind, but decided to keep watching. It did happen quite early on. I was quite shocked at how GRAPHIC the bedroom scenes were. I mean it's nothing on what goes on online these days, but for me, it looked so realistic. (So glad I didn't watch it with my mum, I would have been blushing!) They were extremely realistic, which added a different element to the film. Some bedroom scenes are so faked (or body doubles), or there's zero chemistry between the actors but this seemed very realistic, although I've seen better than Michael Douglas.<br /><br />The actors were all very good. I liked Jeanne Tripplehorn's character, she was more superior to Sharon's and she should have had more screen time, she's always excellent in anything she does (although I do get muddled up between her & Parker Posey.) Sharon did a good job of her role, and made it so much more than the stereotyped vixen it could have been.<br /><br />Although it was slightly long for my liking, it was still good, but it could have done with a very small amount of editing, just to make it run smoother. There were occasional moments when I was looking at my watch, or looking at the display to see how long it had left.<br /><br />If Basic Instinct had been a book first - now THAT could have been interesting. A book about someone writing a book that then happens in real life ... Ooh, I'm confused.<br /><br />It's an absolutely amazing story too. Much better than the murder-by-numbers I was expecting. There were so many twists and turns, and on a second viewing (yes there will be!), there will be quite a few clues to spot. I definitely think the director was playing games with the viewers in this, as it constantly jumps back and forth and keeps you second-guessing about who the killer really is. Even now, after watching the film, reading various posts on IMDB, and reading other reviews, I'm still undecided as to who the killer was. I think there are at least a couple of characters in the frame, but at one point during the film, you are led to believe there's a third who could possibly be the killer.<br /><br />The score was excellent too. At points I didn't notice it - which is always the best score in my opinion, rather than one full of stingers. I have heard one part of the score before, the part over the first bedroom scene between Michael & Sharon, yes it was good, but it's so much better when you see the scenes that accompany it. It makes it that more powerful than just the music by itself.<br /><br />I was very impressed with Basic Instinct, and will definitely be watching it again, just to satisfy my curiosity about the clues littered throughout the film, which I think there are plenty of. I also definitely want to watch it again, to try and figure out the killer definitely is. I'm not sure how to end my review, how to sum it up. I'm intrigued to see comparisons to \\"The Fourth Man\\", also by Paul Verhoeven, so that might need to go on my list of DVDs to get. But I definitely suggest if you haven't seen this movie, you snap it up. It's an excellent movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.ious posts on IMDB, and reading other reviews, I'm still undecided as to who the killer was.

B00005U8EM|4.0|In Harold Ramis's \\"Groundhog Day\\" (1993), an intriguing comedy about repeating the past, Bill Murray is Phil Connors, an arrogantly self-centered and cynical TV weatherman, sent for the fifth time to the small town of Punxsutawney, PA to cover the Groundhog ceremony held every February 2nd. He stumbles into a time warp and winds up repeating the same day over and over again until forced to look at himself from the distance and to examine his attitude.<br /><br />I love this movie - not only it is one of the best, most original, clever and funniest comedies I've seen, it also makes you think of the serious questions. For instance, when Gods want to punish a mean, arrogant SOB, they would not take his sanity away - they will make the whole world around him mad and let him deal with the situation. Or another question, what would you do if you have eternity on your hands? Is it a curse or blessing?<br /><br />Groundhog Day does not reuse tired and stupid jokes; its humor comes from the situations and characters. Bill Murray was born to play Phil Connors and movie uses his talent as a comedian to the fullest. I think it was the best role Murray ever played. His character has gone through transformation before our eyes, and it was very convincing.<br /><br />4.5/5
0783226845|5.0|A very remarkable film. It takes student Charlie Simms, played by Chris O'Donell, doing something different from most people at a very rich college. Thanksgiving will have Charlie working. He gets a job taking care of Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade, played by Al Pacino.  <br /> <br />Frank is not an easy person to get along with, even with the patient Charlie. Frank is also blind. The two of them both have problems to deal with during the course of the film. It's Frank who starts the journey for them, with Charlie not having much choice. Frank wants to experience again the finer things in life. The simple things that he cannot do anymore. <br /> <br />Besides Frank going after his desires, he starts getting interested in Charlie's life. They learn a lot about life together, Frank experiencing loss and anger. Charlie confused and not knowing what to do with an ultimate decision. All this in one film is fantastic, and I have not seen many films cover so much.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|When talking of Bergman, critics and viewers usually name \\"Wild Strawberries\\", \\"The Seventh Seal\\" or \\"Cries and Whispers\\" ahead of Persona. While those films are all amazing and stay very high on my list of all time favorites, for me, the truly unique and unforgettable is \\"Persona\\" - Bergman's enigmatic masterpiece.<br /><br />The story is seemingly simple:<br /><br />\\"A nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson), has been assigned to care for a famous actress, Elizabeth (Liv Ullman), who suddenly stopped speaking during a performance of Electra and has remained silent ever since. When they go to stay in a seaside house owned by Alma's psychiatrist colleague, the apparently self-confident nurse gradually reveals more and more of herself in the face of Elizabeth's silence, and is shocked to read a letter the actress has written implying that Alma is an interesting case-study. The two women seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one (strikingly expressed visually in a famous shot); in a dream sequence (or perhaps fantasy), Elizabeth's husband comes to visit and seems to think that Alma is his wife. Finally Alma, back in her nurse's uniform, catches a bus to go home, leaving the almost-mute Elizabeth alone.\\"<br /><br />Whether Alma was able to get her identity back remains one of the film's many questions.<br /><br />What is absolutely wonderful in the film - performances from two actresses. Anderson is the one who has to carry almost the entire dialog, her voice is one of the film's priceless treasures while Ullman is equally powerful in expressing hundreds of emotions through her face and eyes. Sven Nykvist's camera, the third star of the film makes two stars shine so bright.<br /><br />Each scene in 81 minutes long film is memorable, some of them just unforgettable. For instance, the long scene where Alma reveals her most intimate memories of a sexual encounter with two boys while sunbathing nude with another girl on an empty beach, is infinitely more erotic to listen to than it would have been to see in flashback.<br /><br />There is so much to think about in Persona. One major question concerns Elizabeth's silence: is it elective, as happens in Tarkovsky's \\"Andrei Rublyov\\" , or is it some kind of mental breakdown?. The documentaries about the war horrors that Elizabeth watches on TV suggest the former; the fact that it suddenly happens during a stage performance of \\"Electra\\" suggests the latter. I keep thinking about it. Why \\"Electra\\" of all plays? The story of the daughter who hated her mother and wanted her dead - does it reflect the accusation brought up by Alma that Elizabeth did not love her deformed son and wanted him dead? Did Elizabeth become so overwhelmed by guilt realizing that her life reminded so much of Electra's story? We don't know for sure, and Bergman does not help. The identical monologue in which Alma is accusing Elizabeth is the film's resolution. We hear it twice: first time, camera is concentrating on Elizabeth's face, second time - on Alma's. Is Alma talking about Elizabeth or herself or both? After that encounter on the beach, Alma became pregnant and had an abortion. The monologue may reflect her feelings of guilt and emptiness as well as Elizabeth's. Does it really happen?<br /><br />Is Elizabeth a vampire sucking the life out of her victims only to use them as characters for her acting roles? Is that the ultimate price the artist is paying for being a great artist? Does he need lives and souls of others to be able to create? Can he/she love the ones who utterly depend on them and need their love? This film and later Autumn Sonata (1978) with Ingrid Bergman as a concert pianist show famous stars as selfish women who can't and don't love their children. The same question was brought up also in the earlier \\"Through a Glass Darkly (1961)\\" - in the relationship of the writer and his daughter.<br /><br />Then there is the question of whether there are really two women at all; could the whole film be playedout as a fantasy of one of them, or indeed of somebody else?

For almost forty years, viewers and filmmakers alike have been trying to find the answers. One thing is obvious - this is one of the films you want to watch over and over again.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|An epic film in the tradition of \\"Dr. Zhivago\\".  It may be Warren Beatty's best role.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm very fond of Sci-fi.Firefly and Serenity are the dvd I would like to wacht again and again.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Inexpressibly moving story of an old man who is determined to set things right with a brother he has not spoken to in 10 years, while there is still time. It is a film about the goodness in everyday people and how it surmounts the pain and and evil that every life encounters.  It tells of gentle triumph over the inevitability of life's end and the aging that precedes it.  Especially suitable for older viewers or anyone with sensitivity to the process of aging.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is one of the best dvd live I do like the most.
B0002GTWQA|5.0|As a child I was quite fascinated by this movie.  It had all the ingredients to make it an excellent movie where one uses imagination.  Made an impression on me as a boy and after seeing it again it is still enjoyable.  They do not make movies like this any more.  Those in the same ganre are based on special effects, this one (like Mutiny on the Bounty) are based on good story line.  Gripping stuff.  Highly recommended.
076790592X|5.0|Received promptly - brand new condition... very satisfied. will definitely do business with this bookseller again!
B000FTWB7G|3.0|First off, I loved the Fallen album.  However, this album was a bit disappointing compared to their debut.  I listen to a lot of music at my desk while working, but with this album, the intros to a lot of the songs seem to be too similar.  I had to check multiple times to see if I had my mp3 player on repeat, because I felt that I had already heard a song before.  The style on this album is too homogeneous for my tastes.  The music and the lyrics simply did not grab my attention the way the first album did.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This DVD has excellent quality. You can see the change of color from the old to the new. We also took time to review the other options and features. The only word I can give you for this review is EXCELLENT.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|This two disc collection just reiterates the fact that the Allman Brothers Band with Duane Allman were very powerful ... not to take anything away from the other group members ... they all were important. Duane was the leader and it shows. The real steal here is the \\"other\\" Fillmore East concert ... the sound is pristine ... you can hear Berry Oakley really kicking the bottom-end like never before. The remixing of this pair of CDs and that of the original Fillmore East CDs have given us the true \\"sound\\" that the Brothers were known for. Its hard to believe that these recordings are 35 years on. This music is still very relevant.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This product is exceptional! I enjoyed getting it in the mail, very excited about watching it, and everything about the DVD's were exactly like it proclaims. Thanks for such a great product!
B000E41MS6|5.0|For those of us that actually remember The Cold War and fuel prices that were less than a dollar there was a great Tv Show called Doctor Who. It came from Great Britain and featured cheesy special effects and a constantly changing main character. Afterr a while, you got to know \\"The Doctor\\" and the world he lived in and if you were lucky enough to get it on local PBS stations it became a weekly ritual (and of course the marathons durring the Pledge Drives!) <br /> <br />Okay, maybe this is more me than everyone, but for those that were like me, you can relate. The show had a good run. It ran for over 25 seasons and featured seven Doctors as well as countless \\"Companions\\" (random people that hung out with him and mostly got into horrible situations that required rescuing). However, in 1988 it went away seemingly forever. There was an attempt to bring it back through a colaboration between the BBC and Fox Tv in the early 90's, but it really wasn't \\"series-worthy\\". <br /> <br />Now, let's fast forward ahead nearly one and a half decades and the show is back. There's another new Doctor and right off the bat he has a companion. But, this show is different. Instead of being made of episodes with 4-7 parts, it's done with a series of 45 minute self-contained episodes. The special effects are improved (although, still kinda' cheesy by American standards) and the writing's a lot better. The Doctor actually has more depth to his character and he and his companion, Rose, have more of a true friendship going. You actually care about these two. More than one episode left me in tears at the end (especially the season finale).  <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the classic series or just someone that wants to see a good modern sci-fi-drama, this boxed set is for you. <br /> <br />But wait, there's more! Also included is a series of behind the scenes shows called \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\" hosted by Simon Pegg (Shaun of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\") giving lots of insight into the show (but, wait until you've watched all the episodes first! You don't want to spoil the fun) <br /> <br />It's worth the time and the money to get this great set. <br /> <br />-Ferret
B000E1ZBH2|4.0|Both my wife and I loved this movie very much.  She has watched it over 20 times.  I've watched it several times and I almost never do that!  Beautiful soundtrack.  The soundtrack itself is probably worth buying.  Great scenery in England, excellent cast, great sets and costumes.  Donald Sutherland as the father of the young girls is outstanding, as is Keira Knightley (as Elizabeth) and her older sister in the movie.  One suggestion: turn on the English subtitles.  That will greatly enhance your appreciation of the movie, because the actors speak rapidly in an English dialect.
B0006GQMC8|4.0|Very exciting movie with a great cast, something you just dont see anymore.
B0009XFMXI|5.0|With this album, Patti Smith reinvigorated rock in the mid 1970s. A lot of British Punk was just 3-chord anger, but Horses opened up new worlds with its poetic lyrics and melodicism. This ominous version of Gloria, the lilting reggae of the sad Redondo Beach, the evocative surrealism of Kimberly and the violently erotic title track were like nothing else in rock music, and they're still unique and special. I'm not crazy about each & every track but they all have great worth and Horses will forever stand as a monument to the best in rock music. Excepting the title track, the aforementioned are quite accessible and hummable to the mainstream (as opposed to Art Rock) fan. This reissue includes a live version of My Generaton. Oh and Patti looks so sensual on the cover.
B00005JPDY|4.0|Robert De Niro's second directorial effort \\"The Good Shepherd\\" purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War.  Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats.  At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, \\"The Good Shepherd\\" is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across.  I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit.  I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.<br /><br />Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence.  With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion.  From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party.  From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being \\"rooked\\"), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American \\"peace time\\" organization known as the C.I.A.  The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.<br /><br />Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was).  Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands.  Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch.  Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character.  Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family.  Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over.  But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing.  Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him.  Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us.  It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.<br /><br />The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.<br /><br />Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him.  As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character.  In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.<br /><br />De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage.  Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it`s hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that`s Hollywood).<br /><br />This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be \\"theatrical\\" and \\"showy\\" to be effective.  His performance is the glue that holds this long, potentially unwieldy film together.he cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.   <br /> <br />Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him.

B000I5X81K|5.0|A completely different Josh Groban than we are used to, but still the great artist that we have all known was great.
B000FP2OPY|4.0|...and you live outside the USA then this is the copy of series 1 you need. Unlike the international version (Which I initially purchased) it actually has extras - and lots of them. See a day in the life of Jared and Jensen, view deleted scenes, hear commentaries and much more. The packaging is also a lot cooler. <br /> <br />So don't be a chump. Learn from my mistake and get all the candy!
B000002AS3|5.0|I found this CD by browsing Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I am happy with all of the tracks.  Some tracks remind me of Beatles a little, but not all, so the band does have a unique sound.  Even though from the 90s, the sound is like many bands making it today.  I like it.t
B000GUJYLU|5.0|Ah, what can be said about this film?  A LOT....<br /><br />It is, first and foremost, a retelling of the classic tale of Cinderella, but infused with historical fiction and factual characters.<br /><br />You've read the plot points above, and I don't need to go over them again...  The movie, however, is spectacular...!  The acting is just about top notch, with excellent performances by Drew Barrymore (as Danielle, aka Cindersoot/Cinderella) and Dougray Scott (as the crown prince of France, Henry).  Exceptional is the word to describe Anjelica Houston's performance as Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, the \\"evil\\" step-mother.<br /><br />Great performances are turned in by nearly all the supporting characters, including an interesting twist on the \\"evil\\" step-sisters, Maguerite and Jacqueline...  But in this retelling - only one of the sisters is truly mean and spiteful - a vengeful witch of a girl...  Jacqueline, however, being somewhat plainer than her blond bombshell of a sister, is far more accepting of Danielle and others as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Also a surprise is Richard O'Brian (of Rocky Horror and Shock Treatment fame) as an evil and covetous local baron/lord who sets his sites on Danielle and won't take NO for an answer - until he's threatened with becoming skewered by Danielle...<br /><br />A truly humorous scene is the wedding of Prince Henry is just about to wed a wailing and thoroughly unhappy princess of Spain - who sobs and cries and wails throughout the ceremony - also lamenting that she cannot marry the one she loves, and is, instead, forced into a royal arrangement between her parents and Henry's parents.<br /><br />The film is also peppered with great lines of dialog that are delivered with precision and the proper tone, right down to Baroness Rodmilla demurely asking how long she may have to live, after her treachories are discovered.<br /><br />With inputs from Leonardo da Vinci, the King & Queen of France (Francis and his wife), and a band of Gypsies, not to mention the household staff of Danielle's familial home, we get the \\"Happily ever after\\" ending we all love and care about...), and a band of Gypsies, not to mention the household staff of Danielle's familial home, we get the \\"Happily ever after\\" ending we all love and care about...

B000JK8OYU|2.0|I thought there would be more mixing of the actual work.  A more intricate mosaic, but it was disappointing.  All of those tracks of music, vocals, and fxs that can be manipulated, but it was another tribute album.  An iconic group, but somebody was afraid to seriously touch those works.  I don't blame them, the collection is timeless, but I was not impressed with the attempt.  All of the creativity and technology available today to create something respectful and exciting, it fell short.  It seems that somebody needed a job, and to assert their name in the public eye, riding on their father's coattails. <br /> <br />A Fan of Music
B000IZJZLM|5.0|We saw these good looking gentlemen on the Larry King Show and were instantly intrigued by their charisma and style.  When we heard them sing, we were \\"blown away.\\" We enjoy the deep resonance and quality of their voices. My husband and I grew up loving the 50-60's music and still pine for it. They are the next generation of tenors.  They seem to be a cross between the 3 Tenors and Josh Groban.  I like the way they have turned the old 60's songs turned into the \\"old\\" style classical romantics.  I have ordered another CD <br />
1594200106|1.0|Beautifully written, great plot, entrancing characters....  Reading this book compelled purchase of every other book to which it was compared in published reviews.  My first copy was paperback - quickly given away - but had to find hardcopy to re-read and re-read.  The voice of the young protagonist and atmosphere of pre-WWII Barcelona were well drawn.  I've bought several copies of this to share with others, as it's easily in the top 10 novels I've ever read.  A real masterpiece.
B000EOTAM6|5.0|This was great the first time and gets better with each viewing. So much is happening at one time it needs to be re-visited to catch what was missed the first time. Great movie.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|Sure, the blistering (well, not Todd Rundgren blistering) guitar solos are there. Sure, Meat sings his head off, he always does. If you loved Bat 1, you may like this. But to me, there just isn't enough fresh feel to this. In the case of Bats out of Hell, turns out the first cut was the deepest....

B0000AQS0F|5.0|To respond to one of the most recent reviews that gave 1 out of 5 stars. If you don't like this genres of films, then you would never like this show. Also, Fox canceled the show and never gave it a real chance! They didn't even show the two part piolt until the end of the show. But, as far as the series itself, it is one of a kind! From the truly origional story concept, to the witty, sharp, and intellectual  writting, to the cast themselves. This show was just in its infincy and was truly creative and entertaining. Just imigine what it could have been if given the chance. I belive that Joss Whedon is one of the most inovative and  imiginative writers and directors around today. With all the crap on TV these days, a show like this with an actual storyline, that really makes you want to invest youself into the characters, was a dream come true. Thank you.

006056251X|5.0|Out of the four \\"Wallflower\\" books, I enjoyed this book, the 3rd in the series, the most.  In fact, I loved this book.  I've read it several times and have my favorite scenes marked so that I can re-read them frequently.  On the surface, the story-line is not original:  selfish, and penniless, rake marries, and then falls for the shy and stuttering, but wealthy, maiden. Yet, somehow, this story really works.  It turns out that St. Vincent (the rake) isn't completely self absorbed; that is just what he likes to believe of himself.  The author really makes this possible and believable by giving us a \\"peek\\" into his childhood and friendships. On the flip side, although Evie is shy and retiring, she never gave in to her abusive relative's wishes.  So, it is not unlikely that she stands up to St. Vincent when it is important to her. The dialogue (especially St. Vincent) is very funny.  I found myself actually laughing out loud on several occasions.  The ending is happy, as expected.  I highly recommend this book.  It is one of the best historical romance novels I have ever read.

B000HWZ61Y|5.0|The Hysteria CD being re-released by the one of the greatest rock bands ever has been an awesome buy. Worth every penny!!! With a remaster of the original CD and added special features such as lives tracks of many songs from the early days never released before is a must have for any rock fan. Highly recommended!!! Def Leppard can still rock the house live!
B0000028RR|5.0|This cd is by far their best as far as I'm concerned. It's got it all, anger, passion, meaningful lyrics, killer grooves, bigass beats, awesome tunes and everything else that makes a great cd.<br /><br />These guys really set a tone with this release and it still stands tall today.<br /><br />If you like bands like the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, you'll love this stuff and it's truly something special.
B000JJ4GW0|5.0|This is a great compilation of U2's music from 1983's Unforgettable Fire to the latest releases, \\"The Saint's Are Coming\\" & \\"Window In The Skies\\" in November 2006.  And thus what you get is 18 songs from 4 of the greatest musicians of all time in the #1 band in the world.  Add 18+4+1 this equals 23 years of great U2 music.  Same as subtracting 2006 from 1983.  Pretty clever, eh?  Let's all hope for another 23 years of U2 because they just keep getting better and better.  Their Vertigo tour from March of 2005 until December of 2006 is proof of that...  ALL 131 shows were sold out.  WOW !<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD & DVD combo to any die-hard U2 fan because the DVD bonus footage of U2 live in Milan in July 2005 is spectacular.  And for any one who wants a taste of what U2 is all about and wants a primer of their greatest songs... this is the collection to have.  For any one who also wants to know what all the hype is about a live U2 show... this is also the CD-DVD combo to have.

He is 18 years old.

I voted twice for the Clinton/Gore ticket and also for Gore in 2000. What a shame he didnt make it to the White House.

I reccomend this book to anyone, regardless of religious beliefs. It's not a sin to read. I can't say enough about this book, other than the fact that I know that if everyone in the world were to sit down and read it, the world would be a MUCH MUCH MUCH nicer place for all  of us to live. My compliments to the author. This book will stand the tests of time.

0226264211|5.0|I purchased this book because I wanted to know more about economics, but other than a few rudimentary courses, I did not know much and I had heard Milton Friedman was good at explaining economic concepts to non-economists.  Indeed, Friedman is very good at explaining the concepts he discusses at a level for lay people.  That does not mean you will easily get all the concept in this book, I did need to reread passages to understand some of his points.  What I found surprising and refreshing in this book is that the ideas are opposite of what I've been taught throughout my schooling (like the great depression was caused by the stock market crash).  Whether you think his ideas are good or not, or whether you agree with him, I think the truly intellectual mind should be able to consider his ideas - and the basic tenet that capitalism, even though it has a number of problems, insures the greatest freedom and that government reduces freedom.  I would have, until reading this book, assumed without thinking too hard, that public schooling was necessary and that doctors need to be liscensed.  This book challenges you to think about what government's purpose is, and whether it regulations are helpful or hurtful and how best to achieve freedom.  I found this book so interesting I purchased Free to Choose, which is basically and expansion of the ideas in this book, with a few extra topics and easier to understand examples.  I would recommend this book strongly and intend to purchase more books by Milton Friedman in the future.
032147404X|5.0|This is an excellant book on digital photography,very practical and easy to follow. I have been using a NIKON 8800 camera, which is a very good camera especially for landscape photos. It has 10x optical zoom,and anti-shake; however, I believe this book has brought about my decision to finally go with the SLR. I will continue to use this camera for certain specified duties.

0385338082|5.0|This book is a fun, light read that takes about 2 to 3 hours to read.  I have never read any of Kinsella's books before, but I definately will be doing so after this novel.  The basic plot is that Emma is living her life in London, trying to move up in the corporate world, beat out her cousin Kerry in her parents affections, and convince herself that her boyfriend is the man of her dreams.  When Emma gets on a flight and hits turbulence, she thinks she's gonna die and starts blabbing all her secrets to her seatmate, who later ends up being her boss.  Obviously this leads to some awkward and funny moments when said boss comes to check out the branch of the company that Emma works for.  What I really enjoyed was the upbeat attitude that Emma has - she goes through some absolutely mortifying situations, but she tries to put a good spin on it and does her best.  You can't help liking her, even if she makes some bad decisions.  I thought the end of the book drew out the plot too long - the last 30 pages or so feel a little forced because of a plot twist that is not needed.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|The most striking thing about this movie, and something that has been widely mentioned with good reason, are the spectacular performances of the movie's lead characters, Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.  Their acting is tremendous, but as Johnny Cash and June Carter they do their own singing as well, and pull it off remarkably well.  I believe Cash's voice to be inimitable, but Phoenix makes a very good attempt.   <br /> <br />Most of the movie's entertainment value comes from the music--the singing throughout is certainly the highlight.  The movie dragged a bit for me at times, but for the most part flowed fairly well, and some of the most interesting events in Cash's life (his introduction to Folsom while in the Air Force, touring with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, and others, etc) are chronicled well.  Johnny's pill-popping addiction seemed a bit drawn out to me, however.  Despite this fact, however, this was a very entertaining movie and certainly worthwhile.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Ah, this is currently my fave film.  I've lost count of how many times I've watched it. <br /> <br />I will say that when I first watched the film, I was confused as to why this terrorist, V, was being glorified.  But once the plot fully unfolds and all is made known, the reason for V being viewed as a hero is more than clear. <br /> <br />This is a tale of V, it is a tale of Evey Hammond, it is a tale of a fascist government run by Chancellor Sutler, impeccably played by John Hurt, it is a tale of revenge, it is a tale of mass conspiracy, it is a tale of love, it is a tale of so much more.  The complexity of the plot delighted me. <br /> <br />And the performances!  It doesn't get any better than Hugo Weaving as V, in my opinion.  He wears the mask through the entire film and the emotion he portrays using various methods is a total credit to his phenomenal talent as an actor.  There are not a great many other actors who can emote that much feeling even sans masks!  And his voice!  It sends chills through me every time I hear it.  I truly fell in love with V. <br /> <br />Natalie Portman is magnificent as well.  She is so beautiful and a natural actress.  Her accent could have been a bit better, but only a bit.  Her performance, particularly her interactions with V, are absolutely beguiling. <br /> <br />Stephen Rea is also excellent as Chief Inspector Finch.  The entire cast does a wonderful job bringing this film to life. <br /> <br />The look of the film doesn't disappoint whatsoever.  Being a Matrix fan, I loved the dark and gloomy, but slick look of V for Vendetta.  The knife fights where V takes on his opponents are absolutely stunning, not to mention the striking quality of V's black clothing in contrast to the stark whiteness of his Guy Fawke's mask. <br /> <br />I would greatly urge you to ride along with V, Evey and Finch on this fantastic and eye-opening journey.  Most highly recommended.  A masterpiece.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|I loved this CD!!! I know there are like 5 different versions of this album, and I chose this because it covers the songs I like, it's not too expensive and it arrived just in time for me to listen it over and over again before the concert. It's great, it is the nearest to collector's edition, without all the fuzz of searching.

0743289412|2.0|Every Stephen King book (with the exception of this one) has turned me into a crack junkie of reading.  I carried his books where-ever I went and read while hiding the books beneath my desk, inserted in the hymninals at church, on the bus bench, while waiting for dentists to stick tools in my mouth, etc.  This is the ONLY one that I had to force myself to finish! About mid-way through the book I realized that it really wasn't going to get any better and that I truly, truly hated whiney, little Lisey.  I felt that I owed King the courtesy of finishing the book in respect for all his others that gave me such pleasure. I only got through it by rooting for the bad guys to get Lisey and kill her in some horrible, boolish way.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|There's rock music before Edward Van Halen (but I should say modern music) and music after Edward Van Halen just like there's a Jazz before Charlie Parker and all the modern jazz after Bird. Eddie to me is a giant like Bird. And there's just one giant every some generations. A man who completly rewrote the rules everyone accept, the language everyone can speak, the aesthetic everyone follows, the role of the instrument, the musician's figure, the whole concept of music. I'm a musician and I know what I'm saying. His contribution can't be underestimated. His influence in modern rock and modern music in general is immense just like Bird's has been in jazz. Obviously he had his own influences but when he exploded onto the scene with this album he seemed to be coming from nowhere. He seemed an alien landed from another planet! His wild interpretation of every single side of rock music (writing, comping and soloing) completly changed the world in a heartbeat. From that moment on everything that happened before in rock music seemed old of ages, and nothing could be compared anymore (a lot of good things that happened before Eddie however has been rightly rediscovered later). And Eddie's approach and music is modern still today and it will be forever! In 30 years it hasn't get old a bit! Not a single fragment of dust landed on his music and on his innovations that absolutly were not just tapping like someone says! Now that you have hundreds of guitarists that took his lesson word for word like Vai, Satriani, and all the hair metal guys of the eighties, you can make the mistake of taking Eddie for granted. I don't do this. I still consider him, not the most important guitarist pay attention, but the most important OVERALL MUSICIAN of the last 50 years. Noone has been more influent, more copied, more admired. He's Edward Van Halen. Of course this album together with VHII to say the least is the stuff of legend. To me, is one of the 3 most important rock albums ever together with something from the Led Zep ... and who knows whatelse can be put near this thing. And even the Van Halen band as a whole (I'm talking about the sound but Eddie was almost everything in the band) was completly revolutionary. )In saying this I'm expressing another convinction of mine. I find totally futile the discussion if Roth is better than Hagar or vice versa. Because Eddie's star was and still is so bright and shocking that even Mickey Mouse could sing with him. Personally I find interesting both but anyway ... I think that not owning this album is a real crime. Is like having the opportunity to buy a revolutionary masterpiece in art (think Monna Lisa or Andy Warhol's Marilyn) for 10 bucks and decide to pass over it. Crazy.with something from the Led Zep ... and who knows whatelse can be put near this thing.

0596007124|5.0|This is the best design patterns book i have ever laid hands on. <br />With an absolutely different approach this book makes learning design patterns such an enjoyable experience. <br />Having worked with Object Oriented programming in Java for many years i found myself enjoying the reading with every page and could see many aspects of design practically unfold in multitude of images in my mind as well as in the book. <br />The examples are great, the bullet points are excellent and the pace and tone of the text alongwith the images and drawings are absolutely fantastic. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn and apply patterns in their object oriented programming. <br />Kudos to the authors who have done such a wonderful job

A must for any Gwen fan. Love Wind It Up, Sweet Escape!
B000J10ERO|5.0|Overall Superman Returns sends a unique message--that the world needs a Savior, even though so many believe it does not.  Superman, in the movie, is the \\"savior\\" but it left me dwelling on the real Savior of the world--Jesus Christ.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I found out about Firefly by accident.  I had bought Serenity which was fantastic and watched the making of it then learnt it was preceded by a series - Firefly. <br />I bought it for my husband, which he promptly put on and didn't stop watching.  I got caught up in the series from listening to it in the background.   <br />The set design is like it really would be if humans had expanded into the universe and travelled on spaceships and were still colonizing outer planets, it's like the pioneer days, the old west.  Which if you like realistic type shows (eg where the actors get into a fight and really look like they've been knocked about and are hurt) then you will like this for the realism.  But it is a space western type show.  Don't dismiss this one though because you either don't like space movies or don't like westerns.  It actually took me a couple of times of watching this to get into it.  Having watched Serenity upteen times this gave me the persistence to carry on watching.  This really could have been a show that went on for a number of years.  I got to the last episode and it was a case of... what the?? Now I really want the next series.  Shame. <br />The other interesting thing about this show is that Joss Whedon has cross-bred the chinese language into this, as the two biggest languages in the world - today - it is only natural that in the future we would speak English and throw in a bit of Chinese when we want to get someones attention.   <br />You have 9 main characters, Captain Malcolm Reynolds, his first - Zoe, her husband - Wash who pilots the ship (Totally different from Star Trek where the Captain is on the Bridge all the time, in this show Malcolm is actually interacting with the crew and giving orders all over the ship) <br />Shepard Book (who is a preacher, I believe they were going to introduce later in the series Shepard Book as an ex assassin or bounty hunter, there are hints all throughout the series that point in that direction) <br />Inara - a courtisan - who secretly loves Malcolm, Jane - who enjoys a fight, Kaylee - ships engineer, Simon - ships doctor and his sister River, who is a bit muddled up because she was experimented on by the Alliance - an organisation who wants to govern everything.  <br />The ship is great, which they actually built to give realism and it is realistic, like a ship would be - watch Aliens and check out their ship (which was built that way because James Cameron liked the realism of the \\"Millenium Falcon\\" on Star Wars) <br />There is a quite a bit of humour too, but the purpose of their fight is to keep away from the Alliance who have a bounty out for River and Simon.  To earn a living they smuggle cargo and steal shipments.  Captain Malcolm although living outside the Alliance does have a heart and always does the right thing. <br />Give this one a go, watch it a couple of times, then you will see what everyone is going on about.

As they get older, this book helps them to learn their animals and colors.  We also made animal sounds to go along with each animal to jazz up the story a bit as she got older.

0784011176|4.0|This movie was lavished with praise when it first came out, but after a number of viewings over the years I find its intense mysteriousness less and less appealing. Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mail-order bride who goes to remote New Zealand to meet her husband (played by Sam Neill). We learn that by choice she has not spoken since age six, though why is never disclosed; indeed, the point is made that she doesn't know why, either. Her one solace is a piano, which she plays well. But Neill refuses to have the instrument brought to his home and another man, George Baines (played by Harvey Keitel), uneducated, but morally decent, takes the piano and lets her play it at his place. But he wants something from her in return - sexual favors. Gradually they fall in love and by movie's end have gone off together, sans piano, which they have thrown into the ocean. There are a lot of unanswered questions raised: why is Ada voluntarily mute? why is she so repulsed by her husband? why does she fall for Baines? - and the fact that these mysteries linger after the credits roll is annoying. The main theme seems to revolve around the love triangle, but devoid of purpose. As a heroine, Hunter is more a freak and social outcast. The movie is poetic and sensual, but at the expense of all reason. The piano itself is an interesting symbol with lots of implications, but the wildly lush settings and extremely odd behavior of the principal characters overshadow its significance. Although quite an eyeful (and earful), the movie leaves too many important questions unanswered.

B00008CLOA|5.0|Review no. 306. Pink Floyd's 1973 landmark album release. Where (if you ask me)early British psychedelia evolves into progressive. This newly remastered 30th Anniversary Edition is nice to have, with the two-layered job manufactured into the disc. What will they think of next? Tracks that I simply love hearing just about any day, afternoon, late night, etc. are \\"Time\\", \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\", \\"Us And Them\\", the awesome \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\". Take it FROM me, get the 'real' thing here. Avoid any of those cheesy tribute titles where they have one or several unknown artists play a tune or two off this stellar classic. 'Dark Side Of The Moon' is an absolute must-have.

B00028HBL6|5.0|The passsion is the best movie about JESUS. It is far better than those syrpy bible movies insstead of ignoring the cruelty of the time it shows it in graphic detail. Jim cavezi is better in theJesus role than any one. the beatings are grusome  the crusifiicsion  is brutal with every detail shown. one inaccuracy is the damage to the templle the Bible says the curtain between the people and the highpreist was torn nothing else. the passion is the best if you havent seen it get it or rent it.
B000024D4R|5.0|I know that Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall are generally regarded as their best and are certainly more popular in general, but this is my favorite Floyd album overall. Part of me realizes that this being the year/tour I saw them probably has a lot to do with it, but I would still argue that Dogs and Pigs (3 different ones) are 2 of their BEST songs even if I hadn't!!! And, as other reviewers have already mentioned, this is some of Gilmour's BEST guitar work.... PERIOD!!!<br /><br />Bottom line.....if you don't have Animals, your Pink Floyd collection is incomplete!!
B000FDFVZ6|3.0|At first, this book really caught my attention.  The entire idea seemed very interesting to me and the beginning certainly caught my interest.  But as I continued reading I slowly began to lose interest. [MANY spoilers ensue] <br /> <br />To be blunt, this book tries to hard.  The minute Susie's mother began kissing the head detective on her daughter's case (after having him weirdly repeat \\"your daughter's murder\\" twice?) I had to put the book down for a while.  How annoying! Once I picked the book back up again I took it less serious as everything to me now seemed overdramatic.  The chapter where Susie goes back and forth between her mother's adulteress sex scene and her sister's with her boyfriend was a tad ridiculous.  I felt that it had been written for the soul purpose of appealing to prospective movie producers (and clearly, it has caught their eyes.)  <br /> <br />The ending didn't really satisfy any of my questions.  Yes, Susie gets a few quick moments back on earth...that's great, who saw that coming?!  But what does she do? Has sex with her first crush.  Perhaps I am a cynic, but that's a bit far fetched for me.  I can't be positive in stating what I would do if I had a quick second chance on earth, but if I was brutally raped and murdered, no matter how many years had passed, I don't think I would be thinking too much about sex.  Lot's of sex in this book.  Too much sex.  Not only does she have sex, but she doesn't mention to the man where her body is buried, that she just saw her murderer (who could most likely murder again), or ask to be taken to the hospital to see her family.  No, she just has sex.  <br /> <br />If I am not being clear enough: the ending was lacking!   For a book of this nature I was not expecting a storybook ending.  Things seem to work out for everyone.  The family gets back together, Lindsay marries her first and only boyfriend, Buckley learns to play the drums, Susie's mother stays home, her father survives a heart attack and stops living in the past, Ruth and Ray have some sort of closure, and Susie's murderer gets killed by an icicle...har har? (That part being the least clever, in my opinion.)  All in all, this book tries to be profound and falls short...very short.  But if you want a quick read that doesn't require you to think to much (and you like sex), I would suggest this.
0066620996|5.0|This is an Excellent Book & a must read for any small to medium size business owner's, especially those with an established business looking to get to the next level. Jim Collins & his team did an excellent job of pinpointing the key ingredients for turning a \\"Good Biz\\" into a \\"Great Biz\\". A very insightful and thought-provoking book, which has turned into a text-book for us to implement in our day-to-day business & Weekly Staff Meetings...I also recommend the \\"Audio Version\\" of the book, to hear the words directly from Jim Collins.
B000002I2I|4.0|After the rather dismal \\"The Soft Parade,\\" an album that took The Doors in a shamefully disappointing string-and-brass instrument direction, they hurled back in 1970 with \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" their strongest, most rocking album since their self-titled debut. Jumpstarted with the mid-tempo Roadside Blues, the album moves between subtle mood pieces, and melodic rock outs, all constructed with Jim Morrison's fine lyrical sentiment, and exceptional grasp on hooks, creating some of the most intimate music of its day. Songs like the political, Peace Frog, and the playful Land Ho!, The Spy, and Maggie M'Gill work some elegant mojo into audience's emotions and beliefs; they are also not just some of The Doors best songs, but also some of the best songs of their genre of all time. \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is also fortified with the escalating skill of Bobby Krieger, John Densmore, and Ray Manzarek's' masterful rhythm, and instrumental knowledge of blues and rock components; creating a flourishing backdrop to Morrison's words, thus adding additional sentiment to the lyrical themes. Though there is some slight underwhelming moments here, like in Blue Sunday, and (in this critics opinion) Indian Summer, two songs that feature Morrison's great signing, but do not have much to them, both lyrically, and instrumentally, otherwise. Yet, despite some small imperfections, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is still a masterwork by a band of grand artistic envision, skill, and talent.    **** ½ (Out of 5)

Even if you think Sharon Stone got her acting degree out of a cereal box, get it! Let me tell you something, this three hour epic looks mind numbingly stunning.

Do yourself a favor and get this disc right now because if you don't; Nicky will come back with a bat and if you beat him with a bat, he'll come back with a knife and you beat him with a knife, he'll come back with a gun and if you beat him with a gun, you better kill him because he'll keep comin' back, and back until one of you is dead.
B000002I25|4.0|The Doors album hit shelves in January of 1967: few recordings have ever had as grand a signature of its time as this one, encapsulating the \\"self-discovery\\" phase, freedom, and free love of the hippy era. As whether it was singing about the apocalypse caused by the nation's youth  (The End) or displaying sexual desires (Back Door Man,) vocalist, and all-American freedom poet/songwriter, Jim Morrison, showed a knack for emotion, satire, politics, and seemed to have a heart of gold, that only the finest writers can have. Much of the album is some of the best music to come out of this period of art renaissance, creating a riptide in the musical world for years to come. Songs like Break on Through (To the Other Side,) and Twentieth Century Fox are either divinely written, or supremely catchy in their bluesy rhythm that it will linger in the audiences' mind for days.  The band that would go on, much like The Beatles, to inspire countless garage bands, delivered something that few bands can in a debut: a classic, hailed as one of the best artifacts of its era. Yet, it should be said, that despite three songs (out of the 11) that are not up to the snuff with the prime seven, and the last track, The End, of which seemingly never ends, the listener will still know upon the last note of the album, that they have just heard a timeless slice of America, history, and crystallized emotion. In other words, \\"The Doors\\" is what the words \\"great,\\" and \\"timeless,\\" are made for.    **** ½ (Out of 5)

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I missed this film in the theaters, but now the chance has arrived on DVD, and it was good. Ed Norton does a solid job in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist, but Paul Giamatti is great, and should earn an oscar nomination again.  A fictional story taking place in turn of 20th the Century Austria, Giamatti in the role of city chief inspector narrates a film about Eisenheim, an illusionist in vienna  making big noise with his spectacular illusions.  It even gets the attention of Prince Leopold, and more importantly, his soon to be fiancee (Jessica Biel).  I don't want to spoil the movie, but history is layed out and certain paths have crossed before, and then the movie becomes a bunch of smoke and mirrors, Is anything what it seems?  A good movie for the collection, great original story.  A good mystery, and even a little romance.  Check this one out, hopefully the hollywood snobs won't skip this one on Oscar night.

B000EJ9MTW|3.0|It was an impulse buy because I heard their single and thought they must be geniouses. Lo and behold, they're still yeomans in the art of rocking it. They're NOT the new Led Zeppelin - just a weak mix of Wite Stripes and Mars Volta with a large dose of \\"my dad's garage\\" rock. All and all, pretty good, but I got my hopes up for something great.

The dramatic presentation of the story is well done and draws you in even if you do not want to be drawn, and gets you rooting for the good guys, if you can decide who they are???

B00000F169|4.0|This had an unusual storyline, and was well-done on a low budget.  It was quite imaginative for the time, and some of the ideas could be used today.  It is a \\"period-piece\\" sci-fi, mainly for the production rather than the ideas.  With modern effects, it could be successful today.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This show was recommended to me by several friends who knew I would love it.  I don't know why I didn't watch it when it originally aired, but I have become addicted to it in re-runs.  I had to buy Season One to keep forever.  All the characters just grab your heart; it is so well written and acted.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Very good part of the Trilogy of Lord of the Rings, and well presented.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 12 year old son loves to play board games, and I'm usually the person who plays games with him, therefore I am always on the lookout for games I enjoy as well as he does.  This was purchased last Christmas and still remains one of our favorites.  Easy to learn, challenging, always different outcomes, and can be played by 2 or 4 people.  He took it to his after school program and kids of all ages loved it.  A piece became lost, though, which prevents playing a real game, so I contacted the makers and they sent me a bag of ALL the yellow pieces free of charge, very nice.  I have purchased this game for many kids as gifts and everyone enjoys  it.  I highly recommend this game.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This is the best production of the story of the Iliad that I have ever seen.  As hard as I tried, I could not find anything wrong with this movie.  I know the story very well in detail, and yet, I sat transfixed watching this movie.  Very, very effective, and truly enjoyable--standing ovation in my own house!!  Superb--Superior--Outstanding!!!
B000301YY8|3.0|Be careful; there are two versions of this CD. Originally I purchased the one with explicit lyrics and regretted it.  Later I purchased the one without the foul language and enjoyed it much more.
B00027JYLC|5.0|This is done in good taste, and is a very enjoyable movie--well acted--well played--with added mystery effective in drawing you into the story to see someone get what he deserves!

B000BW7QX6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but, after all, I do like sci-fi!  However, this is not your run-of-the-mill, depressing flick--it is positively motivating and uplifting.  Highly recommended.  Thrilling adventure.
B000HEWEEE|4.0|I love both actors, but the story can be a little confusing if you aren't paying attention.  The timeline keeps jumping back and forth...
B0007LXPBI|2.0|This would be a great kids film, except the writers just HAD to put scenes with alcohol in it.  One of the twins samples wine, the mother shows up drunk at the hotel, vodka is mentioned, please! This is a KIDS movie, why do they need to put that in there?  I think I'll pass on buying this for that reason alone!
B00005JNS0|5.0|I get so frustrated when I watch movies with sexual overtones, violence and disturbing language (especially ones designed to entertain children).

B000002UAR|5.0|I think I can save you nice folks some time and give you a quick preview of the majority of the reviews that you'll run across for Revolver: <br /> <br />1.  The Glowing Recommendation - You'll get a lot of these, including my own, and I'll get to that later. <br /> <br />2.  The Comparison.  \\"Revolver is nice, but [insert other Beatles album] is better.\\"  This review may have stars missing.  I recommend that, unless you are a connoisseur, it's mostly irrelevant to your buying.  The reviewer is really saying something to the effect of, \\"A million dollars is great, but I'd give it all up for a little more.\\" <br /> <br />3.  The Non-Specific Derision.  This will be a low-rank review that questions the talent, composition, or general overrated nature of The Beatles as a musical group.  This may or may not interest you, but most of them are faulty and exaggerated, so I would recommend also ignoring these. <br /> <br />Those are the major categories.  The first one is the only one that really matters, and here's why: <br /> <br />I'm not a person that has \\"bests\\" and \\"favorites,\\" unless you can let everything be my best and everything else be my favorite.  Superlatives might fall out of me as a literary device, but I don't really feel them myself.  That said, this record is, unquestionably, within the top ten recordings of popular music ever made available to the listening public.  George Harrison, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon all hit their peak simultaneously during the production of this album (as Rolling Stone will be happy to tell you, in essentially those words), and it shows. <br /> <br />Mind you, there are tracks on here I'm not the biggest fan of.  I've gone on record as saying that the sitar is a sort of musical genocide visited upon Western listeners by the Quiet Beatle, and I stand by the remark, but in a remarkable turn, Harrison's obsession with the beast and his less-witty-than-advertised reflections (\\"Taxman\\" suffers from the sort of repetitiveness that plagues a great amount of pop music, for instance, and it isn't really so biting compared to much of what you could hear around April 15 of any year in the United States) don't hurt the record.  John Lennon's personal dedication to psychedelia, depressive introspection, and whininess in general doesn't hurt the record (and, indeed, is mitigated to a great extent).  Paul McCartney's occasionally obnoxious pop balladeering doesn't hurt the record.  Nothing in this record hurts this record. <br /> <br />This album was created in the studio as the individual band members were starting to grow apart, and while they were first discovering some of the creative things that the recording studio allows a musician to do that live performance denies him, and both of those crucial facts help this recording along.  Each of the songs included here feels and sounds different, in large part because each of the primary writers (and there are very few true collaborations) was himself in the process of becoming a different person.  At the same time, the unifying influence of the producer (George Martin, who deserves a salute) and the band's identity as a whole irons what would otherwise have turned into an ugly mash-up of individual projects into a cohesive sonic experience.  Sgt. Pepper's may have been the first album that The Beatles really designed as an album, but this certainly works as a single piece. <br /> <br />I can't even begin to list all of the things that are right about this album.  The pacing is perfect.  The arrangement is spot-on.  And oh yeah--the performers have a modicum of talent as well.  Nothing goes on longer than it should and nothing feels shorter than it ought to be.  The lyrics are meaningful, but not so insipid and literary that you can't bear to sing along. <br /> <br />The long and the short of it is that Revolver is everything that an album of popular music should aspire to be.  It ranks at the top of my Beatles collection and shares the throne at thetop of my broader music collection with a few select others.  Any fan of music owes it to himself to get this record into his life.
0156012197|5.0|This is my favorite book.  It is beatiful, insightful and entertaining.  A must read.  It is mazing how the author can portray himself as a child and as an outsider at the same time.

B000FTWB7G|3.0|This album veered too far into the realm of Goth. There are a few good songs. For a voice so beautiful it could be used in more of an upbeat method.
0393327655|5.0|I found the book to be incredibly thought provoking even if I didn't necessarily agree with everything the author stated.  Whether you are a religious person or not, it would be difficult to dispute Harris' logic and historical references.  This is a good choice for book clubs that are looking for a lively conversational debate!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Back in my junior year of college (circa 1982) I read a story called The Body by Stephen King that really touched me; I really could relate to the story and the characters.<br /><br />In The Body there's a preteen click of friends very similar to the band of mischief makers that I hung out with in my preteen years (circa 1972). To pass the time, they/we walked the local railroad tracks. They/we smoked cigarettes. They/we got bullied by the neighborhood bullies. They/we did traditional preteen stuff.<br /><br />One day, one of the band of buddies overhears his older brother (a local hoodlum/bully) telling the story of his knowledge of the whereabouts of a dead body. Upon relaying this intrusion to the rest of the click, they all set out on a journey down the tracks to see the body. And ultimately the journey is chock full of events that will stay in the memories of the group forever.<br /><br />So when I heard about 4 years after reading the novella (circa 1986) that Rob Reiner would do a film adaptation of The Body I just knew that it wouldn't...just couldn't...do justice to the book. What film adaptation ever does?<br /><br />Well, Stand By Me does (incidentally, so does Misery; you might say that Reiner is the king of King adaptations).<br /><br />Stand By Me was terrific. It kept all of the most impressionable book scenes entirely intact. And keep in mind that this was a Stephen King novella, so there's some pretty interesting stuff (you can count on King to wow you with precise tales of growing up as a baby boomer that include plenty of thrills...and when he doesn't thrill you he goes for the gross-out!).<br /><br />Importantly, the movie really captured the bonds of friendship so perfectly created in King's novella. The Body was a moving, realistic portrayal of a day in the life of some young kids in a small town; Stand By Me is The Body come to life.<br /><br />And kudos to the key young actors (Sutherland, Wheaton, O'Connell, Phoenix and Feldman) for exact incarnations of the characters in King's story, kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today...the world of growing up in the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br /><br />Stand By Me is a collector's item. Add it to your cart.carnations of the characters in King's story, kudos to Reiner for his direction and kudos to all for putting their hearts into the roles to create a show that not only entertains, but evokes emotional reminisces in viewers that grew up in a very different world from today...the world of growing up in the 50s, 60s and 70s.<br /><br />Stand By Me is a collector's item.

0823016714|1.0|I was hoping that this extensively revised second edition would be a useful addition to my modelling library. No such luck.  <br /> <br />I found the models in this book ugly. There is nothing on mesh topology (which must be modelled right before expressions are started), and very little information to help with production workflow.  <br /> <br />Skip this one and look for something realy good like 'Stop Staring' by Jason Osipa.

B000E6EJAC|5.0|always get the best service from Amazon. And so speedy! Am always impressed!
B000J4QWMC|3.0|Over the years when you buy special edition DVDs like Director's Cut or Special Edition, you get premium contents like inserts and collectible items perhaps. Unfortunately, this is not true with this edition. I was really disappointed. No inserts and the DVD disc itself is plainly printed with Miami Vice text, that's it! Nothing close to other disc which are printed with quality silkscreen/laser graphics. If you are after the movie itself, go for it. But if you are a collector like me, get something else like Pirates of the Caribbean 2.
B00001U0DP|5.0|A great movie! Brings tears to my eyes each time I see it. Worth owning and watching to truly see the value of life.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|It's pretty obvious by now that in the history of rock/pop groups there are The Beatles and there is Everything Else.  Much of Everything Else is great, but The Beatles are in a different musical league entirely.  Anyone who disagrees with this must, in my opinion, be tone-deaf.  There is a lot to \\"love\\" about this CD.  Most apparent to me is the clarity of the recording itself, the re-mastering, etc., which brings out aspects of the original recordings which I never quite noticed before, such as Ringo's underrated drumming.  If only George Martin could give the same treatment to Abbey Road and The White Album!  Nevertheless, I was a bit disappointed that \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" were shortened, meaning an entire verse from each was removed.  If you're going to include those songs, why not include the entire works?  And, the string accompaniment to \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", while gorgeous, is a little overbearing.  I prefer the unaccompanied version from Anthology 3, which is identical to this one (except for the strings).  However, these are minor cavils.  Listen to this CD from start to finish, and be amazed, either for the first time, or all over again.
B000IU3XTM|2.0|This album, to me, is every bit as throughly unimpressive as everything else this man has done. Call me crazy, but I only consider someone a 'great songwriter' (and I've seen the label pinned on Mr. Rice a time or two) after they've written GREAT SONGS. In the case of the artist in question, I can't name a single one (his best-crafted tune, in my opinion, being \\"The Professor & La Fille Danse\\" from his b-sides release). I would call nearly everything in his existing catalog mediocre, at best. So, I guess you can all start hating me now.
B00004RJ74|5.0|this movie is got to be in any body's top 5. its funny, freackyish, cool, sexy, and dangerous all in one.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|In the Machinist, Christian Bale gives a terrific performance as a man with insomnia and severe delusions.  This is a dark and rather disturbing film and not for everyone!   <br /> <br />To perfect his role, Bale lost over 60 pounds and that itself is depressing.  He is such a wonderful actor; however, I feel compelled to say that no movie is worth an actor's health.  Perhaps losing 20 pounds, wearing lose clothing and heavy makeup would have been sufficient for Bale's role in this film. I hope to see this young man around for years and many more films! <br />

B0001GH76I|5.0|Brilliant, brooding story of revenge in Mexico and California in the 1880's.  Classic dialogue and fabulous photography in the only film ever directed by Marlon Brando.  Ben Johnson (who plays Bob Amory and one of the great horsemen in John Ford's films) contributed much of the memorable one liners, such as, \\"Harvey Johnson's gonna be a famous name around these parts.  You're gonna get yourself killed by a fellow called Rio.\\"  \\"It ain't him.\\"  \\"Wouldn't want to lose me a handful of brains trying to find out, now wouldya?\\"  and \\"I gotta lot of funny things to do today, but lippin' with you ain't one of them.\\"

B000GIXEIG|5.0|This movie is one of the best adaptations of germanic folk lore I have ever seen on the screen.  Although it is not entirely accurate as far as the original story, it is still worth watching!  I highly reccomend this film to anyone interested in old Norse and Germanic epic stories!
B000JVT1U0|1.0|I am not sure a movie can get any lamer. I guess it could if you made an even lamer remake.  <br />At the video store I saw this movie and the back said it was the Citizen Kane of horror movies. What? Only if Citizen Kane had lame songs, and naked girls jumping over a fire...scary...this was so bad it became funny.  <br />One review said this movie will stay with you long after you stop watching it, and it will, like gas after eating beans. I usually like \\"bad\\" movies, but this one was beyond that. One star only because there isn't negative ones.

B00004W50T|5.0|The word \\"Americana\\" gets tossed around a lot when people talk about The Band--so much, in fact, I think people don't even think about what it means and think it's synonymous with The Band.  In reality, except the country ballad cover and \\"The Weight,\\" you'd be hard pressed to really find this so-called \\"Americana\\" (which critics invented after The Band's second album) on Music From Big Pink at all.  What you WILL find, is some incredibly slippery, mercurial music that owes a lot to The Band's rock and roll roots (not to mention their gospel, blues and classical roots) as the Hawks as well as their recent collaborations with Dylan, who was in the process of rewriting the rules of songwriting himself.  The result was Music From Big Pink, a totally unique album in The Band's catalog, and an utterly original contribution to American/Canadian rock history.<br /><br />The album daringly kicks off with a slow song, Richard Manuel's collaboration with Bob Dylan, \\"Tears of Rage.\\" Simply put, nobody had made this kind of music before.  Manuel's rich, soulful vocal floats over piano and Robertson's guitar fed through a homemade effect box.  Fat drums and bass lock down a dirge-like beat and flittering organ chases the corners of the background as Manuel sings a father's lament.  One listen to this mysterious soul lets you know you're in for a treat the likes of which you'll probably never hear again.<br /><br />As the album progresses, The Band reveals its multifaceted talents--the tempo picks up on \\"To Kingdom Come,\\" the lyrics become more mysterious (with lots of religious imagery) and Manuel again sings, this time in tandem with Robbie Robertson.  What kind of music is this?  It certainly rocks, and it has a solid, funky bottom to it, but you really can't label it rock, folk, blues or anything.  This is the point when it's probably better to concede that labeling Music From Big Pink with a genre name wouldn't be a successful enterprise, and it'd be better to just let the sweet sounds wash over you.<br /><br />\\"In A Station\\" begins with multi-instrumentalist virtuoso Garth Hudson playing a classically-inflected clavinette line then swerves into unknown territory, with spacey slide guitar and fantastical lyrics.  Manuel wrote and sang the song (backed by Rick Danko), proving The Band not only has multiple singers but also multiple contributing composers.  \\"Caledonia Mission\\" fuses blues and folk with that ineffable Band sound, and bassist Danko sings, exposing another vocal tool to the group's disposal.<br /><br />\\"The Weight,\\" probably the group's best-known song keeps up the mysterious songwriting combined with Hudson's wild piano and drummer Levon Helm's (the group's only American member) southern drawl.  \\"We Can Talk\\" is one of the albums funkiest, hardest rocking numbers, with a sort of jug-band break that's pretty weird--who else would make music like this?  \\"Chest Fever,\\" another mish-mash of styles, starts with Hudson quoting a classical toccata and features yet another drunken-sounding jam break.  The album closes with the heartbreaking love song \\"Lonesome Suzie,\\" and two Dylan collaborations, the dark, driving \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" and the wispy, ethereal \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" with Manuel's priceless falsetto soaring to the very end.<br /><br />Music From Big Pink remains today a totally essential recording, sparking as much musical influence as Dylan's contemporary material, and launching The Band into the spotlight.  I recommend it to any fan of rock, since it's an important historical moment, as well as the beginning of a great collection and trip through The Band's compelling, rich musical career.

B00000255F|5.0|Having been an impressionable fifteen year old when BORN TO RUN first ran, it's hard, thirty two (!) years later to adequately measure the impact this album had. The changes it wrought in the young people who first heard it were very nearly on the cellular level (that's biology, not telephony, you 21st century yahoos!). The only reason that BORN TO RUN did not acquire near biblical status amongst my immediate peers was because Springsteen was a Jerseyite, not a Long Islander (that's \\"Lawn Guylander\\" to you, man), and while bopping back forties in the schoolyard at night and choking down red-pack Marlboros by the handful, we still managed to sneer a bit at \\"B.S.\\", that yokel from the swamplands that stretched \\"from the coastline to The City.\\"<br /><br />Of course, even the sneeringest, the most Billy Joelic, Good Ratsish, and Twisted Sisterite of us couldn't deny that Springsteen had created a work of aural cinematography with BORN TO RUN. Virtually every song is not only memorable but visceral in a way that rock albums have not been for so long since then. Sure, those New Jersey people obviously lived in hog pens and drank budget beer, but just like us, they dreamed of taking Dad's old Musclecar (\\"Hemipowered drones\\") on a 120 MPH rip down Route 80 toward the setting sun. Go West, young man. Go West.<br /><br />And yet, there's more here than wish fulfillment. There's real depth. When Bruce sings of the \\"skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets,\\" he unconsciously echoes Allen Ginsberg in 'Sunflower Sutra': \\"Jack Kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pipe. 'Look at the sunflower,' he said.\\" Springsteen gave us our own flowering in the sun.<br /><br />BORN TO RUN spoke so loudly and meaningfully because it spoke so universally. Trapped in seemingly dead-end suburban small towns (just within sight of the New York skyline, but oh, so far away) we wanted so desperately to run, we dreamed of hearing that long, mournful train whistle blow, we wanted Dylan's vision of the soul in BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, but we also wanted the brash unrestrained energy of Bruce S. on a hot, neon-encrusted night.<br /><br />A Shaman with a guitar, he gave us visions: \\"...She dances across the porch as the radio plays.\\" The blonde wore Wayfarers. Her name was Wendy. Or Mary. Or maybe it didn't matter as long as \\"her eyes shone like the Midnight Sun.

If you're a fan front the beginning or you've just become interested in the series, this would be a great addition to your DVD library. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan do a terrific job of playing the Winchesters. Supernatural is a great mixture of humor, drama, and scary moments.

I have to admit, I don't know much about this field (which I want to become a part of) , but Richard Williams does a great job explaining everything. Some things I had to sit and think about (simple things) to understand, but it's nice having this 'school' at home since I won't be able to go to school for animation for a while. The only thing I don't like is that there are no projects to do, so if you want to practice your skills and want someone to guide you, I recommend Tony White's Animation Workbook. I also have the Illusion of Life and am planning on getting Cartoon Animation. I can't imagine learning without this book.

B00027JYLC|4.0|It is not a pc subject but it is very thought provoking and is very forward thinking for its day and age.  Very entertaining and as medicine has moved on since the film an insight into what happened to disabled or deformed people.  But the twist in the tale is that these people have the laft laugh.

B00005NTNM|3.0|As the third entry in the Dirty Harry film series, The Enforcer is probably a little above average in terms of the time spent in watching it.  Yet, it is a bit of a misfire (no pun intended) after \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"Magnum Force\\".  The character of Harry Callahan returns more to the roots of his original incarnation in the first film, however his presence seems almost wasted here for some unexplained reason.  James Fargo, a long-time member of Eastwood's film-family crew, takes over as director in the third installment of the Dirty Harry saga.    The basic premise of the movie involves a group of self-proclaimed revolutionaries who threaten the city by the Bay, so it's up to Harry to enforce the law and bring them to justice.  At the business-end of a .44 magnum, of course.  The film follows the basic formula of all the other films, as noted below.    The film opens up with a brutal, chilling scene involving a couple of the militants killing two truck delivery men.  Shift to Harry and his current partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum, a.k.a. brother of actor Robert Mitchum) who has appeared in the previous 2 Dirty Harry films.  The robbery/hostage scene is the typical Harry-must-establish-his-credentials-for-the-audience, as in the beginning of every Dirty Harry film.  He does so quite effectively here by dispensing with words and creating his own 'mini-Entebbe raid' on the perps and the store (note Joe Spano, a.k.a. Henry Goldblume from \\"Hill Street Blues\\" as one of the bad guys).      We next find Callahan moved from Homicide to personnel thanks to Captain McKay (Bradford Dillman), which is not to his liking.  Some great dialogue in the personnel board interview scene among all actors involved, and we get introduced to who will obviously become Callahan's new partner, Kate Moore, played by Tyne Daly (sister of actor Tim Daly).  The text of Harry's dislike of political correctness, or 'being stylish' as he puts it, still rings very true today.  In keeping with theprevious films, Harry is given a minority person as a partner: Chico the Hispanic-American in Dirty Harry, Early Smith an African-American in Magnum Force, and now a woman. To being saddled with Moore, Harry utters his tag-line for this film \\"Marvelous\\".  Not as good as \\"Do I feel lucky\\" or \\"Make my day\\", or even \\"A man's got to know his limitations\\", but it's what we the audience are left with. Thus continues the formula.     The People's Revolutionary Strike Force are striking hard, including steeling weapons like LAWS rockets, automatic rifles, and then fatally stabbing Harry's detective friend Frank DiGiorgio who just happened to be in the area while the warehouse robbery was going down.      The city wants to pin the robbery and threat on black militants, but Harry doesn't buy it.  So, when the terrorists kidnap the Mayor, Harry uses every tactic at his disposal to hunt them down.      Throughout the picture, Harry pretty much has disdain for everyone: his superiors, his partner, his informants, the people he questions, the mayor, and even a guy trying to get a free meal at the beginning of the picture.  When Big Ed Mustafa (Albert Popwell, who appeared in 4 of the 5 Dirty Harry films as different characters) says, \\"Man, you really are dirty, aren't you\\", Harry's answer \\"The dirtiest\\" is in some ways an understatement, and in other ways incorrect.  He seems more like \\"Grouchy Harry\\" throughout the film.    There are some excellent lines sprinkled throughout, like \\"V.F.W. - very few whites\\", \\"Why, that's mighty white of you\\", and \\"Your mouthwash ain't makin' it!\\".      Two very glaring errors in The Enforcer are the absence of Lalo Schifrin as composer of the soundtrack and the building-to-building rooftop chase over San Francisco that not only contains rather odd jazz music for such a violent action picture, but also lasts twice as long on screen as it should have.    The final confrontation on Alcatraz Island is exciting and leads to the inevitable death of Harry's partner, again not unexpected given what has been presented to us in the previous two films.      Although exciting in parts, The Enforcer just seemed to have been rushed into production and finished in order to give movie-goers a Dirty Harry film by Christmas.  We are given even less to know about Harry than the previous 2 films, and in some ways he almost seems a caricature of the more despondant, over-worked, not-sure-why-he's-even-doing-this person whom we met in Dirty Harry.  Although a decent action picture, some good lines, and  of course Clint Eastwood all help it, the final result in many ways, \\"The Enforcer\\" still does not rise to any level other than plain old-fashioned popcorn entertainment, and fairly ordinary popcorn at that.

B0001KU93C|5.0|Only Italians know how to make a western. This is not some Johnny Wayne crap American movie,this movie is even better then the Good,the Bad, and the Ugly Jew, with Clint Westwood :)) Do not listen to the reviews made by some American film buffs or whatever they call themselves, see this movie for yourself. Anyway only a European could appreciate a movie like Dijango!

B0009I7NNA|3.0|They are good but they seem to loose hand when playing long songs.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Sex and the City is one of the greatest shows ever made...I recommend that you get this set, 'cause the packaging is just so cool. The box set is amazing...I love it...so if you still don't own Sex and the City on DVD, then this is the BOX SET you should have. Plus I think it's a very good price for all the seasons and the nice looking box set. :)
0743298020|5.0|While I did not read The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel in one evening, I was tempted to do so.  This is an engrossing story and one where there is a beginning, middle and end.  Setterfield makes the settings and people come alive visually and the story is suspensful, but also a hair-raising psychological study of the narrator's and her subject's families.  Very entertaining!
B00005JOWR|5.0|Like many others, I watched this movie expecting an expose of sorts on how the tobacco industry uses deceptive maketing to peddle its filthy products.  What I got was that and much more.      This film touches on the continuing role that sophistry plays in our society.  A bane to society since the days of Socrates, practicioners of this ancient art can \\"win\\" any argument, by changing the subject, appealing to emotion, using buzz words, or by employing countless other tricks.      The goal isn't to find truth, the goal is to persuade the sheep-like masses, who all too often \\"go with their gut\\" instead of analyzing statements rationally.  The central character, Nick Naylor, is a master of this art. As a spokesperson for the tobacco industry, he fields questions about smoking's harmful effects on countless TV shows and in other forums.    Rather than address the issue, he reframes the debate into a discussion about freedom  of choice, attacks the motives of his accusers, and responds to questions with queries of his own.  In short, he is a slippery weasel par excellance.      The film follows him going about his job with his adolescent son in tow.  He teaches the boy the fine points of sophistry while dispensing hush money and conspiring with Hollywood to make smoking look sexy.    One thing I loved about the movie is that there are no clear good guy/bad guy roles.  Everyone's motives are suspect, even the crusading anti-smoking senator who refuses to admit that his state's cheese products are laden with cholesterol and thus a primary factor in heart disease.      This is why I titled my review as I did.  More than anything else, this film is a quirky, funny, occasionally sad but dead-on accurate portrayal of what motivates human behavior.  We may extol virtues such as love, courage, and integriity, but at the end of the day it's lust, greed, and hypocrisy that have made the world go around one more time.  Not the most inspiring thought, but that doesn't make it any less true.
0425188809|5.0|Dean Koontz is one of my favorite authors and though there is always some struggle between good and evil, I find his \\"formula\\" to be reassuring rather than boring.  In my view, this is one of his best books, because all the characters are believable and invite our compassion.  Koontz also has a sense of humor that is enjoyable while giving the readers sit-on-the-edge-of their chairs suspense. The action in Watchers never stops and the ending is very satisfying.
B000I5X81A|5.0|They really enjoyed getting this as a gift and said that they do really enjoy listening to it! If you enhoy Eric Clapton you will enjoy this one! What are you waiting for?!
B00000JLWW|4.0|This movie won 11 academy awards and was over three hours long. Okay, fine. First let me say this was a good movie. I liked it. Now here's the problem. This movie was an hour longer than it should have been. When I watch a historical movie, what I expect is an accurate, educational, and well-done depiction of true events that have redeeming social value and purpose. What I do not want to see is a completely pointless, uninspiring sappy sub-plot designed to make a bunch of puberty suffering teenage girls swoon at the sight of a scrawny, uninspiring, mediocre actor known as Leonardo Dicaprio. It seemed this movie's purpose was to sink more into the depths of pointless romance than it did the Atlantic ocean. However, on the plus side this movie was a realistic depiction of the demise of the Titanic. The special effects were top notch. James Cameron's filmmaking skills were at their best. Cameron is also known for his work on such films as Aliens and the Abyss to name a few. So Cameron's work is definately worth recognition here. But a truely great historical film as I said before sticks to it's main purpose in accurately depicting real history, not a teen romance flick hiding inside a sinking ship.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son, 2, is in love with cars. He must have 2 matchbox cars in his hands at all times so we thought he would greatly enjoy this film. We discovered that we like it as much as he does. This film is, by far, my favorite and I am in my 40's! It has something for everyone including  teenagers. Car buffs will love the animated automobiles, history buffs will love the history included in the movie, and everyone will enjoy the comedy. I highly recomend this film.
B00003Q43A|3.0|3 stars might be a little generous. The movie started off with state of the art special effects and high suspense. Alien invasions in the form of city-sized spacecraft had everybody very interested in the beginning. Too bad that after about an hour and a half or so in the movie the writers decided to wrap it up before the movie ran too long. I guess the writers figured that since we've already impressed the audience enough with our special effects, let's just tack on a quick and happy ending where our heroes easily fly into the mother ship, blow it up, fly out and then crashland the same ship that killed three aliens back in the fifties by the way. Then walk away smoking cigars without a scratch on them. Okay, everybody's happy.<br /><br />Well not me. In a movie with so much build up in the beginning, I like to see a more intelligent and well thought out conclusion. But this is hollywood. We've already sold our tickets, now let's just sell out. Mainstream America will enjoy this film. There's not a lot of thought, just impressive visual effects.

B0007OCG4W|5.0|My husband and I own this DVD, and have watched over and over again.  Each time, there's something popped out to our mind to reflect to our own relationships.  And we enjoyed watching this somehow seemingly fictional and yet realistic love twisting relationships. It's a good to have DVD, and we truly love it!
B000J3EEBY|3.0|Every singer has fans who see artistry in every jot and tittle of that person's work, no matter how good or bad.  And amid the deluge of narcissistic, superficial musicians in popular music today, it would be hard to find anyone more deserving of a following than Loreena McKennitt.  She has more generosity and perseverance than you'll find among the American Idol stars combined. <br /> <br />But every singer-songwriter who produces work as powerful as McKennitt's Mask and Mirror also sets up a standard for future works.  When I saw the album \\"An Ancient Muse\\" at a bookstore, I turned to my wife and said, \\"That's not a good sign.\\" Long-time McKennitt fans might know what I mean.  The title itself had \\"replay\\" written all over it.  This muse, it seemed to me, was ancient enough to be entirely tired. <br /> <br />A bunch of reviewers have noted that \\"Muse\\" seems to include a lot of musical phrases and sounds drawn from previous work.  I would turn this criticism on its head.  A lot of symphonic composers revisit phrases and sounds in later work, but popular music seems to demand constant novelty, to ludicrous extremes.  McKennitt's failure on this album is that her exploration of prior themes doesn't enhance or reconstruct those themes significantly.  In a way, she isn't enough like herself here, which makes these revisitions so lifeless. <br /> <br />I wouldn't have been surprised by this album if she had churned it out only a year or two after Book of Secrets.  But after 10 years the weariness behind this album is a surprise to me.  I expected a work with vitality and power.   <br /> <br />Next time around, maybe McKennitt would benefit from a deadline.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband for his Christmas gift, and he has been playing it almost everyday before going to bed.  He simply loves it dearly and enjoyed watching and listening to it very much.  Somehow, we both just enjoyed it so much and can never get tired of it. Thank you for the fantastic production of this DVD.  We think it's one of the best DVD of the time! <br />

B000AYEL1A|4.0|Kris makes this movie worth watching.  Just think how much better it would have been if Barbara hadn't hogged the film.  It could have been a five with better direction and editing.  If you stop watching the film when John Norman dies and skip the last 15 minutes you'll not regret it, unless you are a diehard Barbara fan that is and can't get enough of her.
B000HEZF0E|5.0|As you would expect since these movies are newer they look great on HD-DVD.  I purchased the boxed set at a retail store and have been happy with the purchase - though notedly I did not have the SD versions of these discs.  While Tom Cruise may arguably be overrated in these movies I think that they are well done, and the quality of them on the HD discs is impeccable.  I would recommend this as a great set for someone who just got and HD-DVD player since it is a fair price for 3 great movies, and you can get a good feeling to how well the actions sequences translate to HD-DVD.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|One of my favorite CD purchases of 2006.<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute;'s alluring voice will capture your attention in a heartbeat.
B000HEZF0E|3.0|I waited for all 3 of these movies to come out in HD before purchase, which although they all look good, by far, MI:III turned out the best.  I think with the modern film and cameras, and with this being the new standard of image, III looks the best, highest definition possible.  I just wasn't impressed with I and II on the HD-DVD format.  I don't know if they didn't clean up the older films or if the techniques used in fimling were lower, but in my opinion they didn't look much better (if at all) than standard DVD.<br /><br />Summary:  If you don't own any of them on DVD get it.  If you own the first 2 on DVD but not the third, but MI:III in HD-DVD and leave the rest alone.

Within 5 minutes, you're HOOKED!
B00006RYIQ|5.0|A truly unique album with a more studio oriented approach. Less acoustic and without the usual repeat tracks - from his Byrds years - heard on most Gene Clark albums. Critics panned this recording initially, but have now decided that Gene was truly a visionary and give it much praise. Some of us non-critics liked it from the start, because of its differences. Gene Clark could do little wrong except die too soon. No Other is a testament to his creativity.
0563486430|4.0|Rayner's books may appeal to a female audiance more than male--leave it to a woman to remember that people have feelings too, and that its not all about stopping the bad guy (or monster, or . . . whatever . . .)This is one of my favorite of the Doctor who books.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|I know this CD came out a while back, but it just seems to get better and better in time.   <br /> <br />I always slap this CD on whenever I'm feelin' down, havin' a bad day at work, or just stuck in traffic.   <br /> <br />From a guy's perspective, you get that feeling like she is talking/singing to you.  I love that about her.    <br /> <br />Oh, and \\"If I was your woman\\" should have been her next single.  <br /> <br />

Does it help resolve issues of being scared at night and peeling your fears apart layer by layer? Could be, but I just like reading it to my son at night. And he will ask for it over and over until I see Red, Green, purple, white......Enjoy books with your children daily and nightly. God knows that the schools do not teach them.

B000BFH2S2|4.0|I had seen this DVD on the local PBS station in Washington State but when I purchased it, I actually was a little disappointed when I ran it to hear some of the comments Michael Buble made that were obviously cut out for the PBS broadcast.  One comment in particular that came from Michael was after he went out in the audience to greet everyone.  He thanked everyone when he returned to the stage and then said \\"And thanks a lot to the guy who grabbed my butt, and you know who you are; that was really nice.\\"  Michael has a clean cut look and appears to be a gentleman, so I don't think that \\"cute\\" talk added anyting to his performance that night.   He also swore a couple times during the performance.  But....his talent and overall performance was outstanding.  Love the old swing music and big band sound!
0307237699|5.0|The Audacity of Hope gives us a foundational glimpse of the experience, character, and values of a type of politician we almost don't recognize today - the civil servant. Through the lessons of history, civics and personal example, Senator Obama guides us toward the common ground of our best hopes for our families and our children, asks us to step outside of ourselves to see the world from each other's point of view, and challenges us to collaborate together in order to move toward a hopeful future.<br /><br />After reading this book, I have no doubt that Senator Obama would be a highly competent and unifying President.  His eloquent writing clearly illustrates his mastery of constitutional law, his grasp of the interconnectedness of the global economy, and his understanding of - and willingness to learn about firsthand - the complexity of issues ordinary people face in their daily lives.  What gives me pause, especially after reading some of the reviews posted below, is not whether he is experienced enough to lead us, but whether all of us are quite ready for him.

B00015TOCY|5.0|I stumbled on this album because it bore the same title (in English) as a revolutionary opera from 1960s China. Eno's album might be called a post-modern English pop album because of this. I read someone somewhere describe this music as a little cold. But I don't think that's it. Eno's  music and lyrics here are strange and quirky in a wonderful way that people used to attribute to \\"wit.\\" At turns comical, macabre, sarcastic, and flippant, this album is a very difficult to describe. It certainly doesn't sound like anything else produced in the 1970s (or since).
0736063684|5.0|I have been lifting since high school. However like many I found myself stuck with an ok and tired workout routine. This book exposed me to new lifts for every area of my body.

Overall a great book.

B00002616T|5.0|Jarrett recordings have always been for me improvisational jazz with a motif you can hum along to and a pocket you can tap your foot to. He does upon occasion venture forth into avant-garde bop that often makes you wonder where and what will emerge but not here. In these excursions the melody and rhythm are foremost. This is Jarrett with Jan Garbarek (sax), Palle Danielsson (bass) and Jon Christiensen (drums) at their most accessible. There is virtuosity as we've come to expect from each on their instrument.<br /><br />The Windup is playful and upbeat. Belonging, Blossom and Solstice are reflective, even searching. Spiral Dance and Long as You Know You're Living Yours are memorable pearls that only Keith Jarrett could bring to fruition.<br /><br />There are subtle echoes and bold challenges ... the interplay between players found so rarely these days. You can choose to listen, or you can let your mind wander and let the complexities melt into chaos or leave it in disarray. They have a home in either realm. There aren't many doing anything like this out there today and Jarrett is among the best. Belonging is a treat for those that have a taste for it.

B000I5X81A|5.0|J. J. Cale who is a long time musicians, \\"Musician\\" with his most talented alter ego, the most listened to and enjoyed guitarist in the last century and this one; bring absolutely soul deep rhythms to the listeners most inner feelings.  Can't miss with this entire bag.  Jazz, Blues, Rock, it's about everything for everybody.
B000GPIPVU|4.0|I first heard the single \\"Trouble\\" on WBOS in Boston. They, and in particular George Knight, were championing him as a New England home-grown singer/songwriter.  I was drawn to his voice and talent immediately. <br /> <br />On the CD \\"Trouble\\", producer Ethan Johns took Lamontagne's simple guitar songs and, by taking a minimalist approach, gracefully complemented his sound with brush drums and occasional string accompaniements.  The product was a sound that highlighted Lamontagne's voice instead of drowning it in overproduction. <br /> <br />On \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\", a brilliant \\"mood\\" album, Lamontagne sounds less like the I'm-just-glad-to-be-here newcomer and much more like he's invested in the effort.  He is a man possessed with a need to deliver emotion but he does so with a controlled delivery.  His vocals are more nuanced than on \\"Trouble'.  They evoke real emotion instead of concern for whether his voice can carry the load. <br /> <br />While \\"Three More Days\\", a catchy R&B tune, may seem out of place here, I suspect it was part of a bargain with the record company to deliver at least one radio-friendly track on an otherwise extremely introspective album.  At least it's a good song whose opening riffs evoke aural images of Dusty Springfield's \\"Son of a Preacher Man\\". <br /> <br />Although dark and appropriate more for late night headphones than for the drive to work, \\"Till The Sun Turns Black\\" is one of the best CD's I've heard in the 2000's.  The songs are brilliant and, once again, the production is spare and deferential to the emotions RL's heart is pouring out. <br /> <br />Outstanding work here.  RL's a truly unique talent...and he's blessed with restrained production.
B000B7HZXM|5.0|actually I bought this as a gift, so I have not listened to this particular CD, but I have his other Songbook CD's, and I love them all, and this one surely is just as good or better.  Rod Stewart can do the old songs just the way I like them.  What a voice!
B000FILW86|5.0|Cheap Trick has been one of my favorite's for more than 25 years. Robin Zander's beguiling vocals have always been the hook. Nobody sings like this guy. Ever. Like many war-horse bands, they are oft criticized for a lack of recent material that compares with their early albums. Maybe that's because those early efforts were so damn good. In any case, Rockford shatters that assumption. Every track a classic. They performed at least six of the new songs when I saw them last summer, and they could have played them all. I have a new favorite song every time I hear \\"Rockford.\\" As good as their best material ever. Inventive, clever, beautiful. And those vocals. Zander has lost little range after all these years, and uses what he has to greater effect. I've seen Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey and Steven Tyler. Zander is better. \\"Rockford\\" has him at him best.

0790729350|3.0|Being of the Woodstock generation I remember vividly going to the theater and watching this revolutionary movie. I say revolutionary because it was ahead of its time for cinema effects. The use of the split screen was a precursor to MTV. It has an awesome soundtrack. It captured the young people that were into rock music during that era better than any film that has survived the 70's in my view. <br /> <br />I realize this movie was made in the 70's, but the theater version was much better quality than this release. The quality is just plain bad. It is certainly not DVD quality (or VHS quality for that matter) and that was a big disappointment. It is grainy and even fuzzy in places. If I did not respect Amazon so much I would say it was a bootleg copy made with a video camera taken into a theater. <br /> <br />The music is outstanding, however, and it is a historical look into the lifestyle of the hippy generation. For that, I gave it three stars.

B00005JNS0|5.0|When I was in high school in the 60's, my family took me on a trip across the United States. It left such an impression that I took my family on a similar trip a few years back. However, it was not as enjoyable and this movie helped me to understand why. We stayed on the freeways the second time around and did not get on the rural roads to see the real America. <br /> <br />Cars is the best animated Disney movie I have every seen. It has great graphics, is funny (Larry the Cable as 'Mater is hilarious), tells a good story and reminds all of us that true American values are alive and well and meaningful living is still taking place in small towns all across America that have been bypassed long ago by the expressways. <br /> <br />Cars sends a strong message to its viewers in this fast paced world we live in ... slow down and smell the roses. There is a Route 66 out there that has many wonderful things to show you. Take it.

B00005RHGL|4.0|To be honest, western \\"classics\\" such as Once Upon a Time in the West or the Good, the Bad and the Ugly always seemed too long for me. I'm all for pacing and character development but only when it seems necessary and if you can get away with it otherwise. But an epic film doesn't have to be super long, no matter how well-made it is (sole exception is Seven Samurai, 3 and 1/2 hours is nothing). Tombstone is one of those kind of westerns people mention almost because they run out of recent westerns to name. Yeah, Unforgiven was great but then it's like \\"now what\\"? Director's cut usually implies the movie the director wanted us to see in the first place so watching Tombstone my first thought was yeah it's a good movie but what's so different this time? <br /> <br />Legendary westerner Wyatt Earp is retiring along with his 2 brothers, Virgil and Morgan and they settle in the town of Tombstone. Also there is Doc Holliday, Wyatt's friend and stricken with tuberculosis. Wyatt has no intention of becoming town sheriff but might have to since \\"the Cowboys\\", a band of red sash-wearing bandits are causing trouble. Wyatt decides enough is enough and basically tears the West apart bringing down the Cowboys. <br /> <br />I have to say this is one impressive cast. In addition to the main 4 leads: Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer(who's exceptional as Holliday), Sam Elliot and Bill Paxton (kind of miscast though), we have Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestley, Billy Zane, Charlton Heston even as well as Billy Bob Thornton and James Cameron regular Michael Biehn. Big cast don't necessarily mean good performances all around except Russell and Kilmer though everyone does have a share. Wasted though are Billy Zane and Jason Priestley who don't really add much or even do much. It's got a bit too much of a more \\"modern\\" feel rather than truly feeling like a western. <br /> <br />Is there enough to like about this film? Definately, there's plenty of shootouts and gun battles, I already mentioned Kilmer but he's just so good from mannerisms to lines, even that weird coin thing he does in his introduction. There's a couple noteworthy scenes and the whole thing has a very accessible quality to it, rather than being too long for its own good. In fact, it almost seems like a good stepping stone into other westerns such as the Leone ones, Unforgiven or the way-back-then ones with John Wayne and whatnot. It's probably not the most deepest or best western you'll see but it's enjoyable when you get down to it. <br /> <br />If all you're looking for is a good western then Tombstone isn't as bad a choice as you would think. Is it those treasured westerns? Probably not but it's worth a look.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|The first time I saw the Matrix I did not appreciate the depth of the philosophical/spiritual content in this film.

I recommend this DVD collection for any who are interested in philosophy and metaphysics, or those who have already seen it but want to look again \\"with eyes that haven't been used before\\".

Esmeralda is accused of the crime, tortured and sentenced to death... When she is about to be hanged, Quasimodo pushes the hangman aside, sweeps her into his arms, and carries her into the sanctuary of Notre Dame...<br /><br />Much of the rich atmosphere so vividly described in the Hugo irresistible tale - the happy Festival of the Fools, the Court of Miracles, the cathedral and its role as the center of medieval Paris, the storming of Notre Dame - provide the spectacle a timeless message of lust, jealousy, prejudice, hate, compassion and love...<br /><br />Quasimodo is just 'one long, ugly face from his head to his toes,' but in his distorted body, there is lot of humanity, kindness, and gratitude... Quasimodo lives high in the church towers... We see him exceptionally agile, showing no fear for its height, climbing down its facade, embracing its huge bell, telling Esmeralda in halting words that she is safe within the walls of the cathedral... That day, Quasimodo leaps onto 'Big Louise' and rides his beloved huge bell back and forth sending its mighty sound throughout Paris for his beloved Esmeralda...<br /><br />Esmeralda is the sensuous gypsy girl, who ascends the pillory to quench Quasimodo's thirst... She is fond of dancing, noise and open air... She is in love with one man whom she calls the 'bright sun.'<br /><br />Master Frollo (Alain Cuny) is the man in black who inspires respect and fear... He is the haunted Archdeacon of Notre Dame, an expert on witchcraft... It is said that he is the greatest magician of all France, but magic is merely illusion...

('We are brothers.. your face and my soul..')<br /><br />Phoebus (Jean Danet) is vain, arrogant, and opportunistic... To him, the Gypsy girl is a sexual object to be cynically manipulated, used and rejected... The only love which the Captain of the King's Archers recognizes is narcissism...

B000ICL3KG|1.0|You should be very careful about taking scientific advice from someone who made a D in his college freshman science course.  AIT is long on hype, short on science.  Like so many eco-scare books from the past (Malthus's \\"An Essay on the Principle of Population\\", Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\", Paul Ehrlich's \\"The Population Bomb\\", etc.) Gore weaves a tale of Future Doom from unconnected threads w/o much actual foundation.  The Earth has been warmer than it is today and the human race flourished.  Under some of the \\"worst case scenarios\\" sea levels may rise as much as 30 inches over the next 100 years:  if the human race can't outrun a 0.3\\" tsunami each year perhaps it's time to chuck it in and turn the planet over to the cockroaches. <br /> <br />And so on.  Ironically if the crisis is so severe and so imminent as Gore paints in his film then the only chance the human race has for survival is to build a bunch of nuclear power plants and stop using fossil fuels altogether, because nothing he proposes will reduce CO2 emissions enough in the time left before climate change is irreversable, according to the alarmists.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|Poverty, Charity, and Obedience are extremely difficult... Detachment from family and friends is difficult... Detachment from things and memories is much more difficult...<br /><br />Silence, detachment and mortification are the conditions of prayer and the negative aspect of a nun's spirituality, while prayer and union with God are its positive aspects... To be firm, prayer must be built on profound humility...<br /><br />Gabrielle Van der Mal is a morally powerful girl who wants from all her heart to be obedient to the bells of the congregation... She perfectly knows that her personal wishes come to an end when she enters that door... Her loving father remembers her: 'If you ever decide this is not right for you, there's no sense of failure coming back home.'<br /><br />The film's first part focuses on the making of a Catholic nun as it follows the young Belgian girl, from the time she takes leave of her dispirited father to enter the rigorous Roman Catholic order, until her appearance as an experienced nursing nun, hopeful of following the medical vocation of her famous surgeon father...<br /><br />The story then moves to the Congo where God selects his moment to offer the most perfect alliance with each individual soul... Gabrielle, now known as Sister Luke, assists as server of Dr. Fortunati, 'a genius, a devil and a non-believer,' who takes pleasure in noting Sister Luke's minor infractions of her vows that would require confession...<br /><br />It's clear that the process of becoming an exemplary nun is a lot harder than any woman can hope for... Sister Luke is supposed to make the love of God the motive of all her actions... She seems to fail in her Vows of Poverty, Charity and Obedience... Pride is not being burned out of her... The more she attempts, the more imperfect she becomes...<br /><br />\\"The Nun's Story\\" is a fascinating film with wonderful touching moments but also with traumatic scenes in a mental institution... The dark side of the Congo is seen through the eyes of a priest, when Sister Luke visited a leper colony...<br /><br />The performances are extraordinary...

B00005JPDJ|5.0|Sit down with a blanket and good friends and enjoy this fun, sexy chick flick.  The story and acting is undeniably sugary sweet, but it is so easy to enjoy, that the time flies by.<br /><br />Two women swap houses to escape desperately broken love lives and, as can only be expected, encounter romance upon their vacations.  One lives in England (in an adorable cottage with an adorable dog) but a hapless one sided love affair leaves her depressed and alone for Christmas.  Another woman, intimidating in her career success, breaks up with a cheating boyfriend right before the holidays.  The two happen to find each other (which is rather good luck, you must admit) and swap houses immediately.  Winslet comes to Diaz's huge palace of a house and stops being the \\"best friend\\" in her movie, but actually becomes the \\"heroine\\" and Diaz finds by far the sexiest man in the world to soften her hard, career driven exterior.<br /><br />Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black, and Cameron Diaz shine (though Diaz seemed to deliver the worst performance).  Both Law and Black sparkle in their first romance films, winning the audience with their charming smiles.  Law is impecabbly sexy and Black incredibly cute.<br /><br />While the film is rather long (138 minutes) I found myself enjoying every second of it, falling in love with both stories, and the substories, the cottages, the dog, the accents, everything.  It was an enjoyable dessert of a movie, and your eyes and heart are sure to be pleased.
B0008ENHUI|4.0|'Papillon' is the forceful portrait of a defiant man, who survives harrowing years of his life in small solitary cells, suffering the worst type of brutality and despair... It is the amazing true life story of a man of character called Henri Charriere, a Frenchman sentenced to life at Devil's island for a murder he did not commit... Henri gains his nick name 'Papillon' for the large butterfly (symbolic of freedom) tattooed on his chest...<br /><br />The film recounts Papillon's tenacity and indomitable spirit, planning and executing a series of failed attempts of escape over many years... We watch his multiple adventures through hundreds of miles of swamp, reaching an encounter with a kind leper colony, a friendly tribe of Indians, and a traitorous nun... Papillon is seen pursued by Indian trustees, and harassed by brutal guards... The power of the movie lies on Papillon's triumph over oppression, his continual perseverance, humanity, honesty, his quiet dignity, and sheer spirit...<br /><br />Guided this time by one of the most creative directors who offered handsomely 'Planet of the Apes' and 'Patton,' Steve McQueen--as Papillon-- exhibits a raw vitality, a complete spectrum of emotions, and a sure command of his technical acting-resources that are breathtaking in their impact..<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman--in perfect rapport with his role, perceptively invading its every nuance and implication-- portrays a quality of character exhibited in the face of impossible adversity... His last scene with McQueen attempting to convince his friend not to leave the island, represents one of the film's most moving, and effective sequence...<br /><br />Schaffner gives a stirring picture of forsaken men, and takes up the challenge and proceeding to 'beat the system' against incalculable odds... He certainly gives rise to some of the great epics of human courage and fortitude...

B00003CY5J|3.0|Edward Norton has come a long way from portraying the weird-looking punk, Jack,in this movie to the handsome, debonair Illutionist of 2006.  The story of a jazz club in Montreal run on dirty money was by Daniel Taylor.  Frank Oz directed.  The music was selected by Howard Shore.  I enjoyed M. Allison's song at the piano in the Club most of all.  The ending was the only surprise, but it was predictable. <br /> <br />There were a few complications with their planned theft.  Norton was a good actor as a handicapped employee (with symptoms of a stroke) who worked on the inside to help with the heist at the House of Commons.  He's sneaky but no one pays any attention to him, and he has access and keys to important places.  He was actually Jack Teller and not Brian at all.  Now, that took acting!  They made it look complicated as they avoided the security cameras.  Nero in that silly mask especially with the goggles, was almost comical.  It was all done by computers.   I wish I had more tech savvy and maybe I'd know how to restart my computer some hacker knocked out.  It was long and drawn out and I really got tired as it was not suspenseful, a lot of damage and sparks flying, but he was double crossed by Jack.   <br /> <br />Or was he?  Jack was left hight and dry without so much as busfare to get out of town.  He was a con man, albeit a super smart one, but he was out-foxed by a pro who'd switched bags.  And, thus, the treasure was headed to the right place while Jack to jail most probably.

6305127697|3.0|This was Edward Norton's first movie role, as an altar boy in Chicago (looked more llike a Boy Scout) with his Southern accent.  He is charged with the vicious murder of his mentor and bishop.  He as a wonder at portraying a boy with a split personality.   Or did he?  How could he so young when Richard Gere, playing his defense attory, was in his prime.  Gere's white hair was shiny and beautiful.  I do like white-haired men.  Women just look old with white hair, while men look 'dignified.' <br /> <br />This was five years before Edward Norton starred in \\"The Score,\\" with Marlon Brandon, which was filmed five years before he really was a star in \\"The Illusionist.\\"  He's turned into a marvelous actor. <br /> <br />How sad that many people see their time on earth as either an hourly wage or doing something unpleasant.  No good thing done for God will go unrewarded.  The bishop, however, was not a lily-white man of God and he used and abused Linda and Aaron who trusted him and made a video of what he had them doing.  Other altar boys at the church had disappeared.  This bishop was a deviant and the tape proved it.  The murderer named Roy gave him 78 stab sounds, some on the gentials.  See this film to know why.   <br /> <br />Sometimes regular people do very bad things.  He was guilty only of dishonoring the Bishop's memory.  Aaron had called him \\"a wonderful man\\" who had forced them perform like circus animals for his own pleasure.  Roy admitted after the woman judge threw the case out of court that there never had been an Aaron (the goody boy) but the client-attorney privilege kept his lawyer who had taken the case just for the media attention it would draw, was his key to freedom.  Love hurts, what can I say?  Gere's character got more than he baragained for when taking on this controversial case and his ego was damaged in the process.

0307277887|4.0|I would NEVER have opted to read this book if it had not been for the Showtime series 'Dexter'-I am more the sci-fi type. I found the strange, twisted life of Dexter Morgan increasingly interesting, so when i found out that it was based on a book, at the risk of spoiling either book or show or both, I read the book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter and was pleasantly surprised. The show followed the book just enough to maintain consistency, yet left the book to be a really good read. So good, I bought the second book, 'Dearly Devoted Dexter' and watched Dexter continue his downward? spiral. This book left me looking forward to both the next installment of the show and the next book. I recommend Darkly Dreaming Dexter if you prefer the outside looking in approach to terror.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I became a Diana Krall fan a few years ago when she performed at the Newport Jazz Festival.  It was so nice to hear the great standard songs done with such class and contemporary style, accompanied by excellent jazz musicians. I have her other albums, \\"The Look of Love\\" and \\"Live in Paris.\\"  \\"From This Moment On\\" continues in this tradition, and Diana and her group sound terrific!  These days many pop singers are recording the standards, and that's okay because it introduces this great music to new generations.  Diana Krall, however, is the real thing -- a true jazz artist.
1854224182|5.0|Although this book has a saucy reputation, it's not all about sex.  It is a rather dreary look at early 20th century England.  Worthy of your time, and the brassy language could still make a school girl blush.
B000001EHS|5.0|This is a great compilation, and I recommend this for all Def Leppard fans.
B00005JNS0|5.0|What can be said that hasn't already been said? This is one of the best animated movies to be included in your library. Superb story, well conceived, excellent nuance, great humor, just the right amount of lightheartedness coupled with moral message. PIXAR Studios again hits a homerun.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|You know, I'm just so tired of the movies that take a comic book franchise, create characters with the names and traits from the book, then completely rewrite everything else about it.  I refrained from saying anything about the first 2 movies, but now it's just borderline ludicrous. <br /> <br />I saw one reviewer refer to Rogue as one of the weakest characters ever, yet in the comics she is one of the most powerful.  My wife kept asking me to help provide some backstory for certain characters and I had to say, \\"Honey, I don't know.  Other than the names and the powers, nothing else is the same.\\"  I saw characters killed that, to my knowledge, have never been killed off in the comic.  It's been a few years since I read the books, but aren't Professor X and Juggernaut closely related?  I was thinking they were brothers, yet there's no recognition when they come face to face.  Some of the earliest X-Men in the books who were the mentors are the young students in the movies.  And don't even get me started on the origin of the Dark Phoenix.  In the comics, the Phoenix was an alien being but here it's the result of a split personality created by the manipulations of Professor X.  In fact, the way things develop in the movie, Professor X is almost as evil in his actions as Magneto. <br /> <br />I continue to be disappointed in the screen development of Marvel comics.  While the DC characters tend to be mostly true to the comics (Superman, Batman), Marvel seems to take great delight in discarding years of comic history and rewriting everything.  The most successful movies are those where they left most of it intact, such as Spiderman.  The dregs are those where they tampered too much, like Daredevil. <br /> <br />X-Men is visually stunning.  Special effects are well done.  If you don't know the comics, the storyline is acceptable.  In fact, I think I would've enjoyed this movie much more if it had the same type of story and characters, but had not called them the X-Men.If you expect to see the characters from the comics on the big screen, you're in for a disappointing ride.  Take me back to the Chris Claremont stories any day.
0375505091|5.0|This is more than a coffee table book.  The photographs are awesome.  Great works by a great photographer.  If you buy only one book by Annie, this is the one to buy.
B000002534|5.0|I recently have been updating some of my collection of LP's to disc and am very glad to have purchased \\"Borboletta\\" again. It is really one of his best works and displays Santana's virtuosity, style and grace. This is not a rock album perse but rather a fusion disc that mixes the worlds of jazz and rock with a heavy dose of spirituality to solidify the effort. \\"Canto de Los Flores\\" manifests the essence of this disc quite well, blending all the aforementioned elements leaving even the most discerning listener wondering where is Santana? Make no doubt , he is all over this disc, it was just a different Santana; the third and final incarnation of his fusion period. Personally I wish he would have done more like this but commerically it wasn't feasable. Listen to \\"One with the Sun\\" and you get the cosmic feel Santana was undergoing and for that matter many of the people of his(our) generation were going through;the dawning of the Age of Aquarius had arrived. Not convinced something was going on in music and all around? Listen to \\" Mirage\\" and you might understand. There are several instrumental only songs that are just beautiful like \\"Aspirations\\" which could as easily be jazz song but rather fuses the elements of rock and jazz for a snapshot sampler of jazz-rock-fusion circa 1974, \\"Here and Now\\" is another one that is the epitome of fusion, \\"Flor de Canela\\" features the wailing guitar work of Carlitos mixed with more jazz rhythms to perfection; there are several other great instrumentals that capture this experimental growth time period of Santana. This is not one of his most popular or best selling discs but it was one of his most personal and therefore one of his most underrated. This is  Mmsic for the soul that sets you free;get it and be free(again).
B000002JK2|4.0|Pete Townshend Ronnie Lane had a history that was rooted in British mid '60s Mod culture - Lane had been writer/bassist for Small Faces (1965-69) and Faces (1969-75), Townshend of course led The Who - and had a common spiritual path that led to a pair of privately produced albums as well as Pete's 1972 debut \\"Who Came First.\\" \\"Rough Mix,\\" issued in 1977, seemed rather slight in its time (with punk stealing attention as both musical and cultural phenomenon), but has aged very well. Though the two greats write seperately, except for the title track, a rocking instrumental, Lane sings lead on the most appropriate Townshend song ('Heart To Hang Onto'), and each adds a great deal to the whole. The music is nuanced, meticulously textured, and utterly undated. Highlights include Lane's hauntingly poetic 'April Fool,' 'Annie' and Townshend's aforementioned 'Heart' and 'Street In The City,' but really this is a powerful yet unassuming gem in its entirety. As stated the auteurs play most of the guitars, basses, and vocals, but guests include the Stones' Charlie Watts and Ian Stewart, plus Eric Clapton, John Entwistle, and others. I suggest the interested reader click over to the newly issued SACD/CD remaster on the Hip-O label, which features exquisite sound and three fine bonus tracks (two by Lane, one by Pete). The upgrade is substantial even if like me you only have a stereo CD player, and sonically blows previous CD editions out of the water.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm thrilled with the new 'Love' album. It doesn't have any 'new' material but the way that it's been mixed let's you hear the songs with fresh ears. I remember studying every bit of songs like I Am The Walrus when I first heard it and this album let's that happen again. <br /> <br />My personal favorite on this album is the new version of Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite, which has to be one of the grittiest, nastiest and best tracks I've heard lately.  <br /> <br />Every track has it's merits especially some of the prettier songs like While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Yesterday. <br /> <br />Full marks to the Martins!
B000059T1E|5.0|Classic, creative rock by true stars of 1960's progressive music.  Excellent blend of rock, folk, ballads, and a hint of improvisation.  Some of Steve Winwood's best.

B00026YO36|5.0|A beautiful album,with slow songs and fast songs and acustic and electrix...There's also a song called \\"strange religion\\" with special guests Duff Mc Kagan and Izzy Stradlin.A pearl!
B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars, while technically proficient with some beautiful animation and backgrounds, is probably the weakest of the Disney/Pixar productions.  There didn't seem to be much heart in the story and even when suspending disbelief, it was difficult to get the mind around the premise that cars inhabited this world.   <br /> <br />The story did pick up with the tractor tipping scene, but overall, it was somewhat less than satisfying.  For a collector of the Pixar efforts, I think the movie should definitely be included as it demonstrates how Pixar is evolving as it continues to turn out movies - but this is certainly not one of their best.

B0007VCZ50|5.0|I had this concert years ago on videotape. It is wonderful to see it again, and it is one of Sting's best works. The mix of his songs with jazz players backing him up is great! Sting is not shabby on guitar, and the dynamics with him on electric are definitely interesting.<br /><br />Especially love watching Omar Hakim, and Darryl Jones has to be one of the most solid bass players out there.<br /><br />This will be watched many times!
0375704027|5.0|\\"NW\\" is a coming of age novel, for its protagonist, Toru, and Japan.  It's not as surreal as HM's other novels - it's not surreal at all - but it's as good or better.  The novel details the changes that Japan faced as a culture, post WW2.  Toru, the narrator, experiences love and loss and life, as a student in Tokyo in the '60s.  He encounters many great characters as he adapts to the changing times, and his changing life, socially, sexually, intellectually.  And HM's steady narrative takes the reader straight through the dark moments - the book has 4 suicides in it - and brings you, along with Toru, to a new understanding of Japan.
068485743X|3.0|Short and a quick read.  This book might work well, as a teaching tool, only for someone who is a real beginner. I felt most of the examples were too simple and aimed at the most basic errors a writer might make. If you have been writing for some time I would look for something that will help more than `The First Five Pages'.  <br />   This book is entertaining but does not address the age old, how to get published, as well as many similar books. Many writers really want to know how to catch a publisher or an agent with the first five pages. This book shows what will certainly chase them off, but not what will catch them. <br />
B00005V9HH|4.0|I have watched this movie several times and it is still as good as the first time.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. It is an unbelievably beautiful movie with footage that is not only thought provoking but also quite stunning. I give this as a gift to everyone I know and have received the same response from them. Pour yourself a glass of wine or a hot cup of tea, sit back and prepare yourself to be transported from one end of the world to another - all without one single word!! Just magical!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Al Gore and Davis Guggenheim have combined to make a compelling documentary.<br />An Inconvenient Truth is promoted as a visual revelation about global warming.<br />Often we read an article in newspapers and magazines or see a short clip on the network news about the effect of global warming in the world and wonder how much is based on fact, fiction or a combination of both. Here, again, you must decide for yourself what is actual fact and what, if anything, has been slanted to support his viewpoint. An Inconvenient Truth gives you Al Gore's take on the validity of the trauma global warming has upon our world. Notably absent were the voices of any scientists to corroborate his assertions. The film is about that issue and what he says is not being done worldwide to combat the danger it presents to life as we know it today.<br />An Inconvenient Truth should be mandatory viewing in our schools, if only, to educate our youth about sifting fact from fiction in our throw away world.<br />I did notice one remarkable personal fact that gave an insight into his upbringing. When his sister Nancy, his only sibling, died from lung cancer their father quit growing tobacco so as not to contribute to anyone else enduring such a loss. The Gore family showed integrity choosing moral responsibility over financial gain. The influence of coming from such a family, one would hope, would be reflected in Al Gore. However, his political chagrin was made quite apparent with his several references to his loss of the presidental election, causing me to suspect his only concern being that of global warming. It was unnecessary to the topic.<br />As for the efforts our current political leaders are undertaking in regard to stopping global pollution, unfortunately, as is the norm, political power and financial gain appear to be worth more than moral integrity and personal responsibility in facing this issue.<br />I recall a saying my father had, 'only fools and dead men never change'.<br />To the best of my knowledge all were alive and well in Washington, DC. Enough said!were alive and well in Washington, DC. Enough said!
1932907009|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and I have to say that I haven't been as excited by anything I've read in a very long time. I feel ready to dive head-first into writing my screenplay. Snyder's writing is extremely clear and easy to read, yet his seemingly commonsensical tips and suggestions will lead you to countless \\"Aha!\\" and \\"Eureka!\\" moments. I took a few screenwriting classes as a film major in college, and I promise you I didn't come away from those with even a fraction of the useful knowledge that I gained from Snyder's book. Not only does he give you invaluable tips for organizing and plotting out your script's plan of attack--which will streamline and make the actual writing process so much easier--but he also explains why certain story elements work and why others don't. But beyond being incredibly helpful, this book also explained one thing that has bothered me for a long time, but I could never quite put my finger on-- namely, why M. Night Shyamalan's movies irritate me so much. Just being able to finally articulate (and have a name for!) what is just plain WRONG about Shyamalan's films is worth at least the price of this book!
B00004RLXC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\\"  I would highly recommend it.  Please keep this in mind, because I'm about to start telling its shortcomings.  None of these shortcomings diminish the five stars it earned.<br /><br />This movie does pale compared to \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark.\\"  Part of it is, as is often the case with sequels, it follows the formula of the first movie.  The formula here:  Indiana Jones has a close call trying to recover an artifact; he then discovers a more important mission.  After plenty of action, including dealing with creepy creatures (snakes in \\"Raiders\\", bugs in \\"Temple Of Doom\\") he gets into a fight, and launches into a thrilling chase sequence, before the climax of the movie.<br /><br />Other weaknesses:  one, some of the scenes are obviously filmed inside instead of outdoors.  Also, George Lucas' interest in Hinduism has cropped up, as opposed to an object more of interest to Jews and Christians (i.e. the Ark of the Covenant).<br /><br />While this does fit into the formula, this movie is unique.  For one thing, it pushed its PG ratings to the limit; in fact, this movie is one of the reasons the PG-13 rating came into being.  For another thing, I enjoyed Kate Capshaw more than any of the other love interests in this series.

B000GUJYLU|5.0|One of Drew Barrymore's best roles (so far).  You don't have to be a Drew Barrymore fan to love this movie.  Not too adult for kids, and adults will appreciate the heroine's travails and trimphs, since she depends on her own brains and strength to overcome obstacles. Good characters surround her - the acting is first rate.
0743298020|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I thought the \\"story-telling\\" was excellent.  I was only disappointed by the ending.  The author seemed to have trouble \\"wrapping it up\\".  All in all a great book...really enjoyed the read.

B000002AHM|5.0|This album is what it is:a showcase of amazing musicianship and heartfelt playing between comrades.There are many beautiful and soft moments,and even more lightning-quick picking that cascades,ebbs, and flows.To say that the music on this album is simply a few guys trying to \\"one-up\\" each other is ludacris.This album is a joy to those whom delve into the emotions in musical art.

0440418569|4.0|The Amber spy glass is an excellent book and compares well to the \\"His dark Materials\\" series. The story follows Will and Lyra on their journey through the many worlds in order to accomplish their various goals. This world hopping is brought about by the use of the Subtle Knife; a Knife that lets them cut little holes in the fabric of space and slip through to another world. <br />Pullman uses vivid yet fairly simple language to convey the themes that are prevalent in his entire trilogy arc. The Amber Spyglass is a gripping novel with distinct characters and original settings. However, a few things keep this from receiving 5 stars. The first is the overall structure. He tends to jump around ALOT from character to character and even switches perspectives within a single sean. The second thing that irked me was its ending. After the beautifully well put together climax, the last 100 pages are nothing special and above all else, corny. <br />But, my gripes are minor and Pullman's novel will keep you entertained as you plow through the 518 pages of fantasy and adventure.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|It is very difficult to describe the emotions that feel when your you listen to this beautiful one Operates, Mozart is simply Mozart are words no to describe the perfect thing of each note and each part of the work... is a taste to the soul. HIGHLY recommendable.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|When LAMB debuted I wasnt interested on it at all. However, due to being a No Doubt fan since their Tragic Kingdom era I had to get it for Gwen, someone who I adore deeply. Her style is unique and nobody dresses like her even close. When I first listen to LAMB gotta admit I was shocked: I hated it with all my guts. What the heck was that? 80s, hip hop, rock all mixed together in 1 record? WTH!! I only liked tracks 1, 2, 3 and 4!!However, I learned to appreciate it for what it was and heck, I was in love with it after getting used to it. So, why am I talking about LAMB on this review? Well, because the same situation that happened with LAMB is happening with The Sweet Escape. This new album is out of this world for sure. Its something I had never listen before. Such a mix of music styles, such a different production. I definately think Gwen has define her style with this record, something I didnt feel happened with LAMB. Wind it up, The Sweet Escape, Early winter, 4 in the morning, Yummy and Wonderful life are one of a kind tracks. Thats what I love about this record, its so unique. I cant understand how people would say that Wind it up is a copy of Fergalicuous when you can see clearly on the Harajuku lovers live dvd that Wind it up was created waaaay before than that crappy song. There are certainly some tracks that I can start to like yet (breaking up, dont get it twisted and u started it) BUT same happened with several tracks from LAMB. This is different so listen to it with a open mind and mostly while having fun!!! I wouldnt judge this record on a 30 seconds preview at all. Be smart and judge it once you listened to it all. 4 stars from me. Way to go Gwen, keep it up.  <br /> <br />ps. btw, so far, the video for THE SWEET ESCAPE is her 2nd best after what you waiting for. Mind blowing for sure!!
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is just a great movie. I am not going to go on and on about the movies plot since 400 other people did. It is this simple. If you have not seen this movie buy it, watch it and thank me later.

0307346609|2.0|The story started out pretty interesting.  Several different imaginary perspectives of what may happen in a pandemic.  And, that's about it.  When the army guy came out and started talking his 'f***'s and 's***'s, then I began to imagine myself - staying up past midnight, with cigarette in my mouth, resting one hand on my keyboard and mouse on the other, looking into my computer screen - playing the ultimate game of the 90's: DooM.  And it kept on going on, level after level.    This book is like a pitch given to Carmack and Romero of Idgames.    It kept on and on.  The chapters are repetitive.  It's like playing the same game over and over, level after level.  I'm sorry if I'm referring this so much to a video game, but that's what it felt like:  just killing and killing.  Boring book.  I guess this book would be interesting for anyone who is into killing, but for me, I'm not into violence in a book.    Felt like watching a video game, one chapter after another....  - I skipped several chapters - til the end, and still - the needle was stuck in the same groove.  Like I said, \\"When's the game gonna come out?\\"

0451191153|5.0|891 reveiws - what more be said.  This book and Atlas Shrugged should be read before you are 20 and then re-read every 10 years throughout your life.  It is amazing what one takes away from each read of these books as their own life changes and matures (college, single, career, married, children, grandchildren, ....).  I am 50 and have just finished my 5th read of Atlas Shrugged.  Alhtough one needs a break after AS, I feel that The Fountainhead has been peering at me from my bookshelf lately.  <br />THERK

1931382794|5.0|This book is a must have for those already training with power or cyclists interested in learning what all the hubbub is about. <br /> <br />I bought the book in October 2006 because I had been hearing success stories from folks who trained with power. The book is well laid out and even provides enough information about the top four power meters and the software they come with to make a reasonable decision, however I would recommend joining some of the forums and reading as much as you can before you make your final decision. <br /> <br />Some of the topics were a bit technical, but you don't have to fully understand the most technical aspects of the book to find the information within these pages useful. I wanted to understand as much as possible without having to become a physiology major. With three readings under my belt I feel confident that I can create a reasonable training plan for improving my standing within the weekend group century rides. In addition to the book the authors provide a power meter course that visits major cities. I believe serious cyclists will find this course helpful especially if they read the book first. <br /> <br />My power meter, which this book and the forums helped me choose, arrived this week. I hope to install it over the weekend and take my first fitness test so I can build a power based training plan. <br /> <br />This book is a must have! <br />
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I don't really focus much attention on environmental issues.  Maybe it's just not \\"sexy\\" enough for me.  That doesn't mean I don't care: I recycle!  However, Al Gore and the makers of the film did a real favor for the cause of stopping global warming.  I often find it difficult to believe any person who is so focused on any single issue.  Single-issue devotees will often believe anything at face-value that supports their cause, and likewise dismiss those points that are contrary to their cause.  And they'll do both of those things regardless of the evidence behind the information.  Sometimes the global warming folks are just plain off.  When I was young - too darned long ago! - I remember teachers telling me that by 2000 NYC would be like Florida.  As a kid growing up in Jersey, you can imagine my disappointment that such a change did not occur.  (I stood on the corner with my Mickey ears on every day waiting!)  Still, if even a quarter of what Gore says is true, then more needs to be done to address pretty convincing evidence that the planet is heating up.  Like the make clear in the film, making the necessary changes requires some dedication, but not some radical readjustments in lifestyles.  Furthermore, the changes may actually HELP our economy.  Unfortunately for Americans, long term economic planning is not a strong point, but maybe we can package it in a way that will sell.  I'm thinking some tie-in with Jackass or something like that.
0761536434|4.0|It starts a little bit slow, but if you bear with Mr. Kent this book will eventually grow on you and you won't be able to let go until the bitter end. <br />I just would have liked a little more information on the more recent consoles and game designers/programmers, as it focuses heavily on the pioneers of the industry, and the arcade side of the business (thus the \\"falling star\\", from 5 to 4...). <br /> <br />A great book, though, and an easy recommendation to anyone interested not only in videogames but in the \\"videogame's culture\\".

B000ICM5VW|3.0|Kong is a very good showcase of the capabilities of HD-DVD.  However, the transfer may be a little TOO good, as it shows the inherent flaws in the CG/effects.  For instance, it becomes blatantly obvious during the brontosaurus stampede that everyone was green screened.  There are also many scenes in this transfer where you can see small defects in the CG that weren't caught during the editing process.  Because of the lower bitrate/resolution on the DVD version, these issues are not apparent.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|That 20 people would survive the collapse of the World Trade Towers and be pulled out alive from under those tons of debris.  That a former Marine would, on-his-own, feel compelled to take himself to ground zero to search for survivors among the smoldering, still-dangerous, ruins that night.  That two first-responders, Port Authority Policeman, would be found by that same Marine (and another self-appointed volunteer) as their survival was nearing failure. That Oliver Stone would make a movie about these two policeman, their ordeal and that of their families, as a microcosm of the terror and tragedy of that day, and do so with reverence and respect.  That his film would be a testament to virtues some of us still prize, those of courage and honor and duty--not only that of John McLoughlin and Willy Jimeno, the trapped policeman, but also of those who dared to go into that burning, unstable and perilous wreckage to bring them out.    This film celebrates those simple virtues-courage, honor, duty, family- and I think Oliver Stone believes them important enough that he set aside political opinion to present them in a straightforward manner.  If you believe this is only the stuff of cheap Hollywood theatrics, well, that's sad. Real guts were plentiful on that day and those following, and I believe that was honestly portrayed here in focusing on the miraculous true story of these two men.    All the performances are heartfelt and equally good.  I was not bored.  I knew going in that this was a story of survival, but the details were gripping and unbelievable nontheless.  I thought Stone and his production caught the immensity of ground zero in deft touches: the roar of the burning buildings amid the falling debris, the ghastly sound of the impact of bodies, the simple enormity of the structures and the dust and confusion, the look of shocked and stunned people everywhere. It gave a sense of the size of the disaster.  The following story would be difficult to tell, with twoof the main leads immoblized in a crushed building, but I thought the editing back and forth from the men to the families worked.    Credit to all involved, this was a film I thought I might not like, but I went with it all the way. Nicely done by Stone and company.  And all respect and good wishes to the real men and their families, and to all those who served that day, and serve now.
B000HIVQK8|2.0|I was disappointed with this purchase.  I believed that there was a DVD with a 5.1 surround mix included in the package but this was not true.  In the future, please inform the consumer as to exactly what is included in the CD/DVD package.
0064409422|5.0|I'm in college and this book is being studied in my English class. It just goes to show you that adults really can enjoy a good children's book. If you've never read this book, I really consider it a must read. I think it would be great for any age child, I am starting to read it to my 6 year old. It is a wonderful fantasy along with a christian message and good that triumphs over evil.
1401917186|2.0|I too pre-ordered this book expecting to receive more information and possibly some new guidance.  As the other reviews indicate it is almost a word for word reprint of Earth Angels.  For anyone who hasn't already read Earth Angels, I would recommend this book instead.  It is a slightly expanded version, with some additional categories.  Again,  quite dissappointed.
B000H5U832|5.0|This movie was wonderful to just watch and enjoy. It also has amazing values in the whole story line. Anyone at any age will enjoy this movie. Children and and person that loves cars will definately love it. My family had fun finding all of the 'hidden' cars parts in the scenery. Once you start finding them, you can't stop finding more. The animation was unbelievable. The characters were wonderful and delightful. I just cannot say anything bad about this movie.
067088278X|5.0|This was one of our favorite books to read outloud to our children. Our 27-year old can still recite the book from memory.  My husband and I would read half a line and the kids would fill in the rest.  The illustrations are great!

B000ERU6QC|3.0|not that great--especially coming off their first album.  or maybe their first album was just too good...
6305127697|3.0|I'm a fan of Richard Gere and enjoyed the twist at the end of this movie.  Was really surprised at the performance of a young Edward Norton. Seems to drag in the middle but watch out for the ending.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|A slightly different take on the classic tale Beowulf.  Granted, it has been many years since I've read the story.  The movie devotes fairly equal time to the antagonist and the heroes.  From the very beginning, we're led to sympathize with the 'monster', who was, we find out, in this director's view, created by his enemy.  Grendel and his father are attacked while on an outing - unprovoked.  Grendel learns to hate his enemy because they kill his father and he's bent on revenge ever since.  So, he's actually the good guy.  He's also a family man himself, all grown up and trying to raise his own child.  The movie was ok, and the acting quite good.  It's worth a look.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|CATS has a special charm for me, and this DVD hit the spot, a real joy to watch, along with a message that touches the heart.
0802714544|4.0|This book is enjoyable enough, but I don't think it is Le Carre's best. I won't gush about the things I liked, but here are two things I didn't like: the narrative perspecitive and the unconvincing ending.  As for the perspective, I wish the story had been told entirely from the perspecive of one character, like in his later books (such as Absolute Friends).  Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is also very very good (as long as you don't mind dealing with a really complex plot).  If you want a more modern espionage/mystery novel, try The Prisoner of Guantanamo by Fesperman, which has the same high quality and realism as le Carre's books. Barry Eisler is good if you are looking for an author who leans slightly more towards action and thrills, but not so much that it is unbelievable. (although they may be slightly less probable, Eisler's books are still quite plausible).     Also, I wish that Le Carre would not try to be so damned clever with his endings. It is a trap that many otherwise good writers fall into: they try to give the ending such a big twist that it stretches the limits of what one is willing to believe. The worst offense is that the author uses the cheap trick of concealing from the reader facts that the protagonist knows, but leading you to think that you know everything that is going on in his head.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban is an amazing performer and I play this CD everyday.  I got a new I Pod for Christmas and his two CD's were the first ones put on.  Amazon does a great job with fast shipping and product is always great.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This movie was totally hysterical, heartwarming, and just an outstanding piece of work if you are trying to explain the #1 most dysfunctional family on earth.<br /><br />The cast is amazing, and it is worth every minute.<br /><br />For some sick, twisted, off-the-wall humor, get this movie.
630469654X|4.0|All this film needs is a new god damn soundtrack and it will be an all time classic. I don't know what kind of smack Richard Donner was smoking when he sat down and watched the film with that god awful 80's rock track and said \\"I love it!\\". They should just scrap the soundtrack and hire James Horner to come in and do a new one. But then again, James Horner has been mailing them in of late as well. How about Thomas Newman? He's always one for pulling the heart strings.  If you can forgive the weird noise that this film insists is its musical score, buy the film and watch it. You're gonna love it.
B000GUJF4G|1.0|I will never understand why Hollywood decides to re-make classic movies, only for them to fail miserably in the box office, and then flop again when released on DVD.<br /><br />What I will never understand even more, is when Hollywood remakes a movie that was horrible THE FIRST TIME, and then they make it even worse the second time around.<br /><br />If you are having trouble sleeping, get this movie.
6304366078|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV the day before leaving to watch the 1988 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, England. I was amazed by the vintage racing action in this movie and by the touching drama played out by the Sarti character. It was fascinating to see many of the legends of motor racing in support roles. The film mirrors the reality of Grand Prix motor racing back in the day with so many of those great drivers being tragically killed only a few years after this film came out, e.g. Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, J. Rindt.     Since seeing this film on the box years ago, I have anxiously awaited its return on Widescreen DVD format. Now having watched it again  on my HD projector with a 96\\" diagonal and surround sound system, I can't believe how fantastic this film looks. Thank  Frankenheimer for filming in 70 mm as the detail is as good or better than any new movie on the big screen and the sound on Dolby 5.1 surround system is fantastic.     This film is a cinematic master piece and a time capsule of the vintage Grand Prix in '60's. Racing fans 100 years of years from now will still be watching and studying this film. It blows all other racing films out of the water including Le Mans (which I consider a boring waste of time).

0743454537|4.0|I cannot remember a time in recent memory where I've devored a book so fast.  I just could not get enough and it would stay with me throughout the day.  I have read \\"Vanishing Acts\\" by the same author and was, sadly, disappointed because this novel was such a gem.  An exquisite story that is deftly conveyed with sensitivity and grace.
1401307450|4.0|As a huge fan of the RHCP, this book was as addicting to read as chocolate. Anthony's llife is truly remarkable and the fact that he made it this far is amazing. He is also a very talented writer who is introspective and descriptive. If you listen to their music, this book will bring you deeper into the music than you thought you could go, and as close to the band as you will probably ever be.
B000005J56|5.0|Michael Fletcher reviewed this CD spot-on.  And I concur with the review that it is magical--it is indeed that.  I can listen to it over and over at work or at home!  It seems to suit almost any mood and simply nourishes the soul.  I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys good music--you don't even need to be a fan of Cuban music.  I certainly am not well versed in Latin music, but am a definite fan of this album!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|the wife and brother really love friends, an ideal xmas gift. <br />the value is great, the workmanship of the product is great. <br />(the only reason, and yes im a butthead i guess, it doesnt get 5 stars is that it could really use a latch on the case to actually KEEP it closed, yes it stays closed on its own, but when you pay as much for this as you do, you should certianly keep it from an \\"ACCIDENTAL\\" knock-over off a shelf since it doesnt exactly fit where the other DVDs do.) <br /> <br />it is however, mildly annoying how they have the layout of the dvd's packaged, they're packaged by charachater. and then lists the seasons on the charachater package. but it does have a very nice booklet that outlines every epp and every show on each dvd. and is overall a VERY nice product! again, 4 of 5 total stars! a great buy!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased the collection for my husband for Christmas. He hasn't had time to watch the whole series yet, but he absolutely loves it.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|The music is not for the light hearted.  There are two basic themes throughout the disc.  This is made for careful listening as the softs are very quiet, and the louds get very loud!  And the very nature of the music lends itself to action.  So if you enjoy a piece with often recurring themes and intensity through 85% of the work, you will like this.  I HAD to buy it because the theme kept knocking around in my head and had to be satisfied!   My whole family likes it very much, but my wife can't take the intensity for more than 20 minutes.
B00020HEL6|5.0|There are a lot of talented vocalists but none more prodigious than Renee Olstead. Her first album release by a major label, the eponymous RENEE OLSTEAD (Reprise) ended at number 2 on the jazz charts when it was released in 2004. She was barely fifteen. There is no relationship between her age and incredible talent. In this delicious collection of jazz standards, she does it all: a cappella, glissandi, falsettos, high Cs, scat, exquisite timing, virtuosic range.<br /><br />Olstead introduces the first tune, the Gershwins' Summertime (marvelously arranged by John Clayton & David Foster), with a stunning half-minute of a cappella fully evocative of the lazy movement of time on Charleston's steamy, torpid Catfish Row, followed with toe tappin' swing, and ending in a torchy glissando. (If you listen carefully, toward the end of the a cappella, you'll hear a chord-like tone that I thought only Buddhist monks could create). Next come tunes like Takin' A Chance On Love, Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby. In Someone To Watch Over Me and Sunday Kind Of Love there are beautiful move over Gabriel trumpet solos by Chris Botti and in Breakin' Up Is Hard To Do a mellow duet with Peter Cincotti, who also provides piano accompaniment. In On A Slow Boat To China, Carol Welsman, winner of several Canadian jazz awards, adds to the vocals and plays piano.<br /><br />In OLSTEAD talented musician's, reading like a list from GROVE'S NEW DICTIONARY OF JAZZ, flock to this exceptional singer including: Rick Baptist, Botti, Warren Luening (trumpet), Alan Broadbent, Billy Childs, Cincotti, Chris Dawson, David Foster, Carol Welsman (piano), Brian Bromberg, John Clayton (Bass), Dennis Budimer, Dean parks (guitar), Joe La Barbera, Vinnie Colaiuta, David Tull (drums). The vocal arrangements are by Carol Welsman and the album is produced by Olstead's discoverer, David Foster, and Humberto Gatica.<br /><br />Olstead's fans complain because so far, at least commercially, the 2004 Reprise album is it. In 2000, when she was eleven, Renee recorded two albums with friends. One of them, UNLEASHED, is apparently available for $88.97. It has 4 tracks. The second, STONE COUNTRY, a country western collection of 10 tracks, doesn't seem to be available at any price. She is featured on 1 track (Pennies from Heaven) in Chris Botti's album, TO LOVE AGAIN (Sony, 2005). Olstead's next release, SKYLARK (Warner Bros. Records), had been promised for 2006 but twice postponed, reportedly to add more tracks, but to date there is no track list readily available. It is now due out in February, 2007.<br /><br />A word might suffice for this gifted artist. Encore!!leven, Renee recorded two albums with friends.

0743289412|5.0|Ooooh Mr. King!  Or as Bob Cratchett said, \\"Another triumph, my dear.\\"  I admit to being highly biased about Stephen King works - it's my opinion that Stephen King is the foremost great author in America (heck, maybe the world!).  To the story.   <br />Poor Lisey loses her husband - a famous author.  Then Lisey's faced with some bad problems:  crazy sister; demented fan; cleaning her dead husband's office.  None of which seem resolvable.  Until she \\"goes to the pool\\" - her husband's wellspring of sanity.  <br />I've heard/read that this work is sort of autobiographical.  Man, if it is, I wanna go to the pool too!  Great work - worth a good reading from anyone, especially King fans.
B000JJ4GW0|4.0|Everything this group puts out is golden.  I would have paid another $10-15 to have the whole concert though.  Perhaps at some point they will release the whole Show (The Bonus DVD of the Milan Show from Vertigo Tour) in it's entirety.  I believe they included about half of the show only.  You just cannot get enough of U2.
B000I5X81A|3.0|Two of the greats have collaborated for a half-great record. \\"Hard to Thrill\\" and the catchy \\"Ride the River\\" are truly fine, and \\"Sporting Life Blues\\" is fun. \\"Three little girls\\" is obviously from EC's heart, as is \\"When this war is over\\" from JJC's. Everyone's musicianship is fine, including guests Billy Preston, John Meyer and Taj Mahal. But several tunes are just, well, boring.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|I thought it was great. These two groups blended together very well for this CD. A couple of the songs by Gnarles Barkley just blew me away.
B00005RDRO|5.0|excellet flick, excellent service.  A bit pricey for an older movie but worth it.
B000BK8FX8|5.0|1 - You Raise Me Up - This is a great song and beautifully done. <br />2 - When You Tell Me That You Love Me - Same as track 1.  This song was done by the American Idol finalists and is available on their C.D. <br />5 - She's Back - I think this is my favorite song on the C.D.  It is a very upbeat tune. <br />11 - Change Your Mind - I love this one and it is kind of like a 1970's song. <br /> <br />THE ABOVE SONGS ARE MY FAVORITES ON THIS ALBUM. <br /> <br />I also like Amazing, That's Where You Find Love, Color My World, and Heart Without a Home.  This is a very good album and would go great with their Unbreakable C.D.  You can listen to it time and time again. <br /> <br />I don't really listen to the songs Desperado, In This Life, or Hit You With the Real Thing (this is a weird song for them; something like NSync would do).
B00000IL1K|5.0|Not sure how it happened but I ended up with a Sarah Brightman Eden CD. By accident I listened to it and this ole boy liked it. Now when I say I liked it, I mean I really liked it.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|This film is so precious -- I've started sharing it with new grandchildren this year and I look forward every year to enjoying this lovely story and the magical music.  Another reviewer mentioned that there is a version of the film with an instrumental version of Walking In The Air -- I've only seen the version where the boy sings the lyrics as James and the Snowman fly through the air -- I love it.  HOWEVER, the version we are reviewing here indicates David Bowie delivers an intro and he's not on the DVD at all -- it's OK without him but reference to his name should be removed from the DVD cover.  I think it's Raymond Briggs giving the voice-over intro.  I also like this DVD best as I don't care for the Father Christmas film at all.  It might be more suited to England's tradition but doesn't go over at all in North America.  THANKS FOR PROVIDING THE SNOWMAN DVD on its own -- a very-much-loved family favourite!
B000I0QK74|4.0|This is a wonderful body of musical work.  His renditions of these classics are  really fresh and delightful.  Such a beautiful voice still strong and so individual all these years later. Softly familiar and sweet. Loved it.

B000FL7CAK|3.0|I really enjoy Veronica Mars and her ablility to defy odds, solving cases and jailing bad guys but the second season of the show didn't feel as personal to the character. Almost daunting, it appears as if something is missing and there is no motivation. I however found comfort in the cast that makes this better Veronica's a little more bareable such as Wallace, Mac and Weevil. The conclusion to this season is undoubtly better to me than the first but the road there seemed misguided almost as if Rob Thomas knew the bunny trail ended but he didn't have the pebbles to follow to get there.<br /><br />The DVD set also offered alot more of the deleted and extended scenes that the first season set but much like the first season did not offer more commentary on the show from actors, producers or even a stage hand.

B00006IIWW|5.0|What's not to like about this super musical Disney version of Beauty and the Beast. The singing is fabulous but the animation is great too and there even some thrills and chills as well. But I am a little biased when it comes to these early Disney movies as I grew up with them. Nevertheless, if you like great music, animation and a super story with enjoyable characters you'll love this classic too.

0553212737|5.0|I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|a long movie, but worth the dedication to sit and watch it.  phenominal acting, great writing, and an ending that makes you want to and actually sprint out and take a victory lap around the block.  If you haven't seen it, get over it and watch and enjoy...

B000K4WPCC|5.0|It was a pretty good movie. The actors were decent and the storyline was decent as well. The plot moved a little fast and it was to easy to spot the bad guy (the first 5 mins and you can figure out who it will be). Some cool uses of the 'power'. The water bubble fight was.... better than having a fireball fight I guess.  <br /> <br />As the other poster's questions about why Caleb was getting beat by Chase once he ascended. Its because Chase had already ascended, and plus Chase had his father's power. Then once Caleb got his power he was able to fight but was at a distinct disadvantage because Chase was 2x his power. But when Chase got more willed to them that made them at least equally matched.. and from the way Caleb beat up the other of the four (don't remember name.. the blonde kid after the bar fight) it seems like he is naturally more powerful than the rest.
B000GG4Y32|4.0|i was 25yrs. younger when i 1st saw this movie....now...i looked at it differently....STILL....an excellent, well-made film with fine now \\"older\\" actors....
B0001I55NS|3.0|I did like this movie, don't get me wrong, but upon watching it again I found plenty of reasons that you might be disappointed.  The screenplay is terrible.  Many of the lines are extremely repetitive or stupid.  Paul Walker's performance is questionable.  If you're a stickler for historical accuracy, even though the story is fictional, they do a pretty good job of making sure the clothing/buildings/etc. fit into the time period.  Overall- good story, but bad screenplay and lack of character development cause it to have some big flaws.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I'm a big Josh Groban fan and I had been waiting impatiently for his newest album.  I hadn't really read anything about it before I bought it, so I was expecting something more along the lines of his first two albums (which I love, especial \\"Closer\\").  The first time I listened to Awake (not under the best circumstances), I was disappointed.  However, after listening to it two more times so far, I'm getting to like it more and more.  I hope anyone who was initially disappointed will take the time to listen a few more times before deciding on it's \\"value.\\"  My rating probably started at 1-2 stars, but is increasing - it might even get to 5!
0765315246|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sci-fi books.  It was a fun and entertaining read.  I have also seen it compared to Heinlien's work, which I can see in some instances, but for the most part I think this is a unique reading experience.  Not a work of classical literature, but a fun book that was just as good the second time around.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I'm an Eagles' fan from day one.  I can never complain about seeing them either on video or live.  Glenn needs to sing more.  His voice gets better and better.  Although the replacement for Felder is excellent, I miss Don.  It's not the same without him.  All in all the production value is better than the Hell Freezes Over, yet as with the former, I wish they had done more in-depth interviews at the end...with more substantive questions and answers.  Special mention has to go to Walsh.  Whereas Don and Glenn rarely seem to be having fun, Joe always seems happy to be out there, playing and goofing.
B00009MGGI|5.0|There are two movies that I watch over and over again: House of Cards with Ian Richardson and Smiley's People with Alec Guinness. <br /> <br />Ian Richardson is superb in House of Cards, so deliciously likeable and yet so thoroughly evil. Not a performance in the film, from any of the actors, goes wanting.  <br /> <br />It's one of those series that you'll find yourself totally sucked in to. You'll want to stay up until 5am to watch all of the episodes in one night!
0307346609|5.0|I won't repeat what others have said, but I do want to add that I think the succcess or the book is due to the clever piecemeal presentation.  The story of World War Z would be too huge to present as a novel.  By breaking it into smaller stories told from the perspective of very different survivors (all with incomplete information) Brooks was able to make it manageable.      I think it would make a lousy movie, though.
B000005GWE|4.0|Over the years, Pat Metheny has released dozens of albums; I find that this one stands out, namely because the numbers on it are much more memorable. I particularly like \\"The Red One\\", track no 2, as well as \\"No Way Jose\\", but I pretty much like the cd through and through.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|The Gilmore Girls has been a great purchase for me, for two reasons.  The content of the show is very family oriented and fun.  Plus it has provided many hours of time for my daughter and I to share, sitting and watching and enjoying the antics of another mother and daughter.
0780624890|4.0|An action packed and intense vampire flick, combined with ballsy drama and good cast (Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson).
B0001KZM3O|4.0|I have benn a pink floyd fan for about twenty years, i first started to discover this great band when i was 13 and momentary lapse of reason was released. over the yaers i have purchased almost every album released under the pink floyd name except this one. everyone i knew who was into floyd warned me tp stay away from this record telling me it just a roger waters solo album, its not really a floyd album since all of the members didnt take part, and that it was just songs that were not good enought for inclusion on the wall. so for years i belived this avoiding the album with out ever hearing it boy was that a mistake this is a great cd if you like the wall this a companion piece to that i cannot listen to the wall without listening to this right after. if you like the late 70s floyd era then you should get this. thank to amazon for recommending this to me
B000I5X81K|1.0|... but this album was extremely disappointing.<br /><br />I keep wondering why he didn't put out a Christmas album instead? I'm sure it would go platinum overnight.
074356619X|5.0|This CD is practical and believable and helps keep me focused on the positive side of life.  It is true that the more you look to the good, the more good you will receive.  I have viewed the DVD a couple times and the CD actually goes beyond what the DVD offers....provides a few of the stories that the movie The Secret inspired.  The substance goes way beyond positive thinking and gives explanations and wonderful examples of the positive effect in people's lives.  You'll be glad you bought it, if you take that step!
B000B8IA2G|4.0|The concept is a bit overused:  The good guys are outmanned and outgunned by a super-foe that can crush them easily (the winning recipe of SG-1).  The good guys just get by with the skin-of-their-teeth.  Eventually, the good guys win over overwhelming odds (did I just give away the last episode?). <br /> <br />The bad guys, the Wraith (are they trying to get the D&D crowd, here?), look like a cross between the swamp monster and a vampire.  They may not have looks, but they do have everything else.  They are hard to kill, have interstellar travel capabilities, have telepathic ability, have transporters, have phasers, are aggressive, have large numbers, and have beaten the super-race of the ancients.  We get it: they are REALLY tough to beat. <br /> <br />However, I am a sucker for computer graphics and advanced technology.  The CG on this show is very good and the concept of having a treasure-trove of advanced technology goodies to play with appeals to me.  Also, there is alot of stuff to be found on Atlantis, so future, undiscovered goodies are still to be found. <br /> <br />Overall, the concept is pretty good and the stories are interesting.  Worth the price.
B000GYI32M|5.0|The story is more original than it seems, and... the quality of the script, the actors' performance, a superb casting, and unique dialogues (especially for Seth) get us hooked and keeps us hooked all along on a large scope of emotions. The story works without the traditional ingredients of violence and sex, which are not ignored but do not come out as instrumentalized.  <br />As my children wanted to see it as well I had to see most episodes two or three times: it kept on working. Every time was as good as the first time. <br />Brilliant and touching, the series deliver much more than expected. I loved every episode of the first three seasons. (Usually I hate series). <br />
B000F3TBIO|5.0|I absolutely love the CD. I think it's great. It was delievered quickly and in good shape.

Buy the CD it is really cool and amazing and Ect.. Ect..
0743289412|4.0|I am seventeen, and in my short and pointless lifespan, I have read many Stephen King novels.  He is one of the greatest authors of our time.  He encompasses horror into reality, which is why many people can relate to it.  Lisey's Story was not a typical Stephen King novel, but it did indeed hold my attetnion.  It was slow to start, but once it started rolling it never stopped.  It is not a gruesome tale of horror such as Pet Semetary or The Dark Half, so all can relate to it, but it still holds some (I don't think) gruesome scenes.  This is a good book to reel in a friend who does not read Stephen King becuase they believe he is too scary, once they read this they will become hooked, and you can then introduce them to his magnum opus, The Dark Tower series.  Overall I give it four stars because I believe it to move away from the true master of horror I have learned to love, yet it was still crafted by one of the best authors ever and it is a tale of love, which can be more frightening than crafting a tale of horror.  Props to you Mr. King.  Long days, and pleasant nights.
0060832819|2.0|A slow-moving, pretentious novel.  The main character is arrogant and unbearable.  Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares?  And, to the author, just tell me your message.  It could have been said in one sentence.  I don't need a boring story to get your point. <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is among the best of Mark Knopfler, and really good Emmy Lou Harris.  The selections are a mix of country folk, ballads, and rock-a-billy, and are all mellow and good.  I listen to it over and over, which is the best I can say about any music!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh Groban's albums are always terrific.  They just keep getting better, and this one is proof.  A great listen is you like his style and voice.
B000I0QK74|5.0|I received my Christmas CD in time to enjoy the holidays and in perfect condition.  Thank you for excellent service!
630345089X|5.0|Product in good shape. <br />Angel Heart is on my list of all time favorites.  One needs to watch it twice at least to pick up on more of the \\"hints\\" which begin very early - as you will realize close to the end.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Haven't bought any CDs in awhile and was so glad this was my first purchase.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My girlfriend and I have been watching this movie every Christmas since it came out.  It's become a fun romantic tradition for us, and I'd recommend it for everyone.  I think it's got some really interesting storylines, and the characters are great and all tied together really nicely.  Overall, a great movie.
0060776757|5.0|Very sincere and detailed. In the interviews you get to know each member of the band. U2 members have great respect and admiration for each other. You'll find lots of pictures from their childhood, beginnings and all the years until now. Surprisingly the book is very big in terms of size of the pages, nice hardcover, and the quality of the paper is at the top. \\"I have a vision, I have a vision...Television\\". Definitely a collectionable item for U2 fans worldwide.
B00005JPCA|4.0|Casino Royale (2006). Rated PG-13. DVD Running Time: 2 hours, 24 mins.<br />Directed by Martin Campbell.<br />I chose to purchase the Casino Royale Collectors DVD Set with the Poker Cards and Casino Chips included. However, it is no longer in its perfect collectible state since I was eager to open it. Very well wrapped in its plastic. The Casino Royale DVD has a 2-Disc Full-Screen Edition cover over it and exclaiming, with a sticker in the lower right-hand corner, &#34;...with over 90 minutes of Special Features&#34;. Inside the slip cover is the DVD case also wrapped in plastic.<br /> Also  inside is an insert for a Vacation Royale Sweepstakes that expired in April 2007. The prize was to Atlantis at Paradise Island in the Bahamas.<br /><br />  Disc Two: Special Features and trailers.<br />  Subtitles are available, if needed, in Espanol, Portugues,Chinese, Korean and Thai.

The hunt for a new &#34;James Bond&#34; began. On October 2005, it was officially announced Daniel Craig was the new &#34;James Bond&#34;.<br />  Barbara Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson and Sony chose &#34;Casino Royale&#34;.  It is about James Bond's very first mission for MI6.  Daniel Craig is  physically fit, fast at fighting and able to do his own stunts.<br /><br />  Yes, there was a Casino Royale&#34; on television. CLIMAX! (Mystery Theatre) broadcast on CBS, &#34;Casino Royale&#34; on October 21, 1954 with Barry Nelson as &#34;Jimmy Bond&#34;.<br /><br />  Yes, there was another &#34;Casino Royale&#34; movie in 1967. David Niven played the retired Sir James Bond.  However, this film was only a comedy to spoof the first 4 &#34;James Bond&#34; films with Sean Connery.<br /><br />  This 2006 film, distributed by MGM and Columbia/Sony is based upon the Ian Fleming novel.  Daniel Craig portrays &#34;James Bond&#34; as being cocky, arrogant, unattached to women, but romantic and sexy. Disrespectful to &#34;M&#34; as this is an early mission.<br />  The film begins in black & white and changes to color as Daniel Craig makes his gun-barrel appearance.  James Bond is seen in humanly impossible stunts at a construction site as if he were Spiderman or The Hulk. When the MI6 can not find Bond, M (Judi Dench) returns home after work only to find James Bond inside her apartment. M is not pleased and has words to say to him.<br />  At the beach, on a white horse is Solange (Caterina Murino) and James Bond becomes sexually entangled with her. Ah, yes. James has already begun his next mission.  Solange's husband happens to be &#34;Le Chiffre&#34; (Mads Mikkelsen).<br />  In Miami, Bond tries to find Alex Dimitrios (Simon Abkarian) at the Body Worlds exhibit ( a real touring exhibit of artwork using approved stripped cadavers [rubberized] of the human body). This all leads to a wild chase with Carlos (Claudio Santamaria) on a Texron fuel truck headed right for a Skyfleet airplane.  Bond manages to save himself and in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale, he meets Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) who could be Lady Luck for him when he must have a tournament with Le Chiffre. Bond must win all the money for the MI6 account. Also at the table is Mr. Fukutu (Tom So), Mr.Kaminofsky (Lazar Ristovski), Infantie (Ade), Madame Wu (Tsai Chin) and a man by the name of Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) who works for the CIA whom will become Bond's professional friend for many years.<br /><br />  Interesting facts:<br /><br />  Tsai Chin is at the gambling table as &#34;Madame Wu&#34;.

0446310786|5.0|Anyone who has seen the movie starring Gregory Peck knows how moving this story of racial hate and redemption is.  Reading the book is like savoring a long gourmet meal when famished, with the added benefit of not feeling stuffed.<br /><br />I boiught the book whenit was first published.  I bought it now to allow a granddaughter the same pleasure.  Unfortunately she had not received it, because Amazon has not shipped it.<br /><br />Joseph P.

B000LC3ID8|3.0|Okay, I'll admit that the fist \\"Saw\\" was a great film, but this series has gone on waaaay to far.  The 2nd movie was way over hyped (I mean seriously; were those people retarded?) & the only thing that saved it was the twist ending that even still seemed forced.  This 3rd  movie though is dead in the water.  I watched the whole movie waiting for something, anything that might make this newest installment worthy of being put to film... nope.  This one introduces plot points that conflict with the last 2 movies, & this movies forced ending didn't come off nearly as smoothly, in fact, you see it coming from miles away.  I'll admit there is some nifty gore & grotesque moments in the movie, but that's about all it's got going for it.  The fact that there's already a 4th movie in the works just makes me cringe.  Lionsgate, once again is gonna take something good & run it through the mud 'til every last dollar has been sponged out of it & the property is then left worthless.  I understand people are hungry for descent horror, but lowered standards does not a good movie make.  This isn't the worst movie in the world, but definately nothing to brag about & should be watched with your thinking cap OFF.  One of the only redeemeing qualities of the DVD is the feature on the films special effects, even still I wouldn't use it as a deciding factor, it's still your standard special feature fair.  A rental might be warranted here, but anything more might leave you dissapointed & wanting more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a SF nut, my wife avoids SF. We were both hooked on Firefly. Parts of the series were screened in south Africa last year and I was hooked. When I saw the collection I went ahead and bought it. <br /> <br />Great characters, interesting plots. I've bought the follow up movie (Serenity - Like the Firefly series - but with a turbo boost) to this great series. Hopefully some enlightened studio Exec will throw cash at Joss Whedon and we can have a whole lot more series. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B00006DEF9|5.0|One of the greatest movie musicals -- I'd argue THE greatest. The commentaries and background material included in this package add to the pleasure of viewing this MGM classic. I first saw Singin' in the Rain as a teenager and have seen it many times since. Now, after purchasing this DVD, I am able to share Stanley Donen's and Gene Kelly's creative genius with my grandchildren so they, too, can enjoy a sample of the golden age of Hollywood's movie magic.
B00005V1WO|3.0|So we've all read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein...we know the story...we've seen in sliced, diced, chopped, smothered and covered in many different adaptations over the years! This movie, GOTHIC, tells us how Mary was creatively inspired to write the story.<br /><br />Other than the cinematography and brilliant sets/costumes, Gothic is by no means a brilliant peice of cinema. The script is very muddy and you can tell Ken Russell took  A LOT of liberties with it for shock value! The eyes/breasts scene for example as well as the electronic harem stripper. But hey, wine mixed with opium could probably make you see these things. The difference is that most people would laugh out loud instead of being horrified.<br /><br />The cast is first rate. Natasha Richardson, always the lady, makes this film her own. You empathise with her fears most of all because of Mary's tragic backstory. Sadly, Julian Sands and Gabriel Byrne although accomplished actors, are wasted here...especially Sands. He plays Percy Shelley like a little boy who has been told there's no such thing as Santa Clause. Byrne is great but his Lord Byron is shoved too far into the background for his performance to actually further the plot.<br /><br />Overall the film is sufficient entertainment. Something to pop into the old DVD player on a boring weeknight when you need to take your mind off of the days worries. But if you really want to be scared, go to your local bookstore and pick up Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN. She knows what scares you!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was an outstanding show that died too young.  This is a must-see for sci-fi fans and for anyone who appreciates quality television.
0743289412|4.0|Perhaps I'm a bit biased.  I've always been a Stephen King fan, but this one covers all bases.  A story of true love and the bond of family, with his signature touch of violence and the obscure.  Not as lurid as his previous, Cell, this is easily recommended even for those who find King's  books \\"too morbid\\".  Certainly not a lite read.  The many layers of this story coupled with the beautiful, almost poetic writing, has you hanging on every word. The only reason this one keeps you up at night is because it's just so darn good.
B00005JPE7|5.0|\\"It ain't over `til it's over,\\" the tagline for ROCKY BALBOA proudly proclaims.  The truth of the matter is, as moviegoers realize and even Sylvester Stallone himself freely acknowledges, that it was over four films ago.  Why is it, then, that ROCKY BALBOA packs the most fierce and delightful punch since the original masterpiece?  Why is it that thirty years and five sequels later, we still leap up in our seats, toss our popcorn aside, and cheer for Rocky Balboa?  The answer is one word: heart.  The film has heart, and it has it because ROCKY BALBOA stays true to the heart of the original film, long before the increasingly silly sequels began flying like Balboa's much-acclaimed punches. <br />  <br />In ROCKY BALBOA, the titular hero has given up his boxing career (which he actually did at the start of ROCKY V - remember ROCKY V?) and now runs a successful restaurant in the slums of Philadelphia.  His beloved wife Adrian has passed on, and his son has grown up to be an office worker haunted by his father's huge shadow.  His best friend Paulie (the wonderful Burt Young) continues to work in the meat shop.  Meanwhile, back in the ring, ferocious young fighter Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has taken over as the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and has absolutely no competition, having never been defeated in his career.  When a controversial \\"fight simulation\\" between Dixon and Rocky Balboa airs on ESPN, Dixon's publicity-starved managers attempt to set up an exhibition between the current and former Heavyweight Champions of the World.  To the dismay of most of Rocky's friends, he decides to fight Dixon, realizing that it may be the ultimate way to finally accept Adrian's passing. <br />  <br />Although this film began building up immense hype immediately after it became known that it was being made, I was positive it would be the weakest of the series after viewing its outrageous trailer.  I don't think I was alone in that prediction, and I'm sure that there are stillmany people who avoided seeing this film because, well, five ROCKYs was enough.  However, I found that ROCKY BALBOA was my second cinematic surprise in a row (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  The surprise: ROCKY BALBOA is not the simply best ROCKY sequel - it's an excellent film as well. <br />  <br />There's a number of reasons for that.  The biggest, as I said before, is heart.  The film's got heart, and the man responsible for it all is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is truly a wonder.  At sixty years old, he's in the best shape of his life (the guy is huge), he just cranked out an excellent ROCKY sequel (THE excellent ROCKY sequel), and he's about ready to begin production on the fourth RAMBO movie (a movie I'm highly anticipating).  Stallone's script for the movie is heartfelt and true to the spirit of the original film, and at times it's even quite clever; the ending is beautiful.  Stallone's directing is surprisingly classy, as is the gritty photography.  Longtime ROCKY fans may be pleased to learn that composer Bill Conti returns to the series for the first time since ROCKY III, and though most of the music is reused music from the original film, that's really all this movie needs.  One song in particular stands out. <br />  <br />That song is, of course, \\"Gonna Fly Now\\", the soaring anthem that has been the ultimate workout tune for thirty years.  It's used in the inevitable \\"training montage\\", a sequence that the series has never had a problem with making interesting and enjoyable.  This montage is especially inspirational: we haven't seen one of cinema's most beloved heroes in sixteen years, and suddenly he bursts on to the scene and benches about three-hundred pounds more than I'll ever be able to.  I really felt like I was gonna fly now during that scene, and I know I'm not alone. <br />  <br />Does ROCKY BALBOA have its flaws?  Sure.  It has the occasional laughable moment (particularly when Stallone mumbles something about dancing with bears), but forthe most part Stallone knows when the film could wind up being hokey or silly or cliched and he avoids that.  The film is actually very funny intentionally, be it from Rocky's constant greeting of \\"Yo, how you doin'?\\" or a well-timed parody of the series' earlier entries.   <br />  <br />In the final round, and this is undoubtedly the final round, ROCKY BALBOA is the sweetest kind of surprise.  It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in years and seeing that he not only is still alive and kicking - or, in this case, punching - but also that he's doing better than ever.  The directing, the acting, the screenwriting, it's all top-notch, and that's all because of heart.  Heart goes a long way, and thanks to the heart of Sylvester Stallone, as well as his woefully-neglected mind, ROCKY BALBOA is a knockout.
0060776757|5.0|This book is an excellent addition to a U2 fan's collection. I have a few other books about U2 and this one is by far the best. There are so many pictures! Plus it's reasonably priced on Amazon instead of buying it from a store.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|New and beautiful singing voice that will have this artist goings places fast. She has a voice that has been compared to Billie Holiday and although I don't agree with this comparison, I do agree that she is unique and original. I have told everyone about her and how they should get her CD for themselves.
B000002JOH|5.0|Flawless, fierce, insane. Words alone cannot describe this. Fifteen years later, this album continues to deliver like few others can. It's just one of those rare finds. Those who understand, know. Those who don't, too bad. R.I.P. Dimebag.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The soundtrack is without peer, in terms of recent Broadway musicals.  The craftsmanship of Steven Schwartz's score takes you through the highs and lows of the story.  The cast does a bang-up job, and you can actually follow the entire story of the play by simply listening to the soundtrack. I had read the book and a friend then sent me the CD before I saw Wicked on Broadway.  Before I had even seen the show, my family and I were driving around and belting out \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"One Short Day\\" at the top of our lungs.  It's a classic, buy it.
0743556003|4.0|King, all the way. Even this love story, which was a love story on so many levels as well as in time and space. I don't care for love stories, but when it's King, it's not just a love story.
B000008COG|5.0|Ignore what you've heard anywhere else, this is the last time Brian's voice is in top form, the last time the rhythm section really cooks and the last time Malcolm's riffs/songs work from beginning to end. Angus is as always great. There is only one knock against this album, and that is the way the vocals were recorded. Excessive reverb and unwise mixing result in a sound that is hard to explain on a top band's album; somebody was asleep at the switch. Nevertheless, you can listen to this set all the way through without a duff track in the lot. Be thankful for small favors from your favorite Scottish band (by way of Australia).
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence has delivered another compelling set of songs. I know the band has gone through some member changes and I was afraid that it would hurt the music. This album may even be better than the first one--if that is possible.<br /><br />Musically, this one is tight and theatrical in composition. I love the arrangements and on one song in particular--Weight of the World--It starts out with heavy guitars and Amy Lee's singing adds beautiful melodies to the song. Then in the middle of the song, the rest of the music drops out except for acoustic guitar and Amy Lee--so powerful. I love all of the songs on this c.d., which is rare for me. Lithium is another one that stands out to me with the piano in the beginning and then the rest of the band kicks in--really dramatic.

1400049628|5.0|With all the zombie movies out where you sit in your living room screaming at the idiots because everything they seem to be doing is WRONG and you know they are going to die; maybe they should all go loot a book store and grab this book while they are collecting food supplies. It certainly would make for a better and more realistic movie. I know I will be keeping my book handy in case the goverment has a snafu like this. While being amusing and entertaining, it was filled with all the details for survival you wouldn't think to remember in such an emergency. Very realistic and crafty too, I find myself evaluating every building I see when ever I'm riding around where I live, and buying extra water & canned goods whenever I go to the grocery store. This book taught me it's never too soon to prepare. And if it never happens, I was still entertained, and will have extra supplies should the winter snow us in! Buy this book, it's worth the money.

B000I5X81K|2.0|Awake is simply put quite dreadful. It consists of that insipid Euro-Trash Pop Fusion music so popular in Denmark and Las Vegas. The pity is Josh Groban has a great voice that he is wasting on this sort of crap. Just listen to the fullness of his voice on his two cuts from the Barbara Cook At the Met album and compare them to the watered-down, lost in an echo-chamber crooning he does here. Unless you're a die-hard fan, I's avoid this album entirely.

0618680004|5.0|As usual, Dawkins presents his kick-ars argument with passion and eloquence.  Weather or not you entirely agree with his personal beliefs, his views of religion as the \\"trump card\\" of society are extremely important.  It's something we really need to wake up to.  Though not even his best work,  it still earns a 5 from me.  Now excuse me while I mail a copy of this to Dr. Laura...
0790729350|3.0|Woodstock is a must see for all people that have ever wanted to experience what it is like to live 3 days of carefree fun, non-judgemental people.  It captures all aspects of the concerts, and the thousands of people that attended the event.  With the personal interviews, you get a great sense of the strong emotional connection the people have with the music, and to prove that they can make a difference.  It is a beautiful documentation of the times.  Highly recommended for all.
031286504X|5.0|I revisited this book I first read about 10 years ago upon hearing that they plan to make a movie of it for release this year (starring Will Smith).  I Am Legend was also the inspiration for Last Man on Earth (Vincent Price) and Omega Man (Charleton Heston).  Some say it inspired George Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" series, as well.  I read the screenplay for this latest version and it's MUCH closer to Matheson's original vision than Omega Man.  Can't wait!<br /><br />Even though it's a novella (140 pages or so) and not a novel, it's the quality of the story that draws you in and makes you feel Neville's pain, loneliness and despair.  It does the most important thing a good story does in engaging the reader as one is constantly asking, \\"how would I behave in this situation?\\"

B000EGDC0A|2.0|The only reason to purchase this record is to help Goldfrapp make up for the relatively small sales of Felt mountain, which was a brilliant record. Heck, buy Black Cherry too, as it was an excellent record. Supernature is, however, bland, rambling and uninspired.
B000J103PC|5.0|When Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) lets her hair down with Andrea Sachs (played by Ann Hathaway) in Paris, after she has let Andrea know that Miranda's husband, Steven, does not need to be picked up at the airport since he has decided to sue for divorce, Andrea fully identifying with Miranda's situation (one can see it so well in Ann Hathaway's face, and one should not underestimate Ann Hathaway's performance), asks Miranda, \\"Is there anything else I can do?\\" Miranda quickly settles back into her normal \\"hauteur\\" and replies, \\"Your job.\\"     That is exactly what one can say that everyone involved with this film has done. The writer of the screenplay, McKenna (if I remember correctly) has gone farther than the original book by Lauren Weisberger and has given the devil her due. The cutting and editing are simply perfect. The music is admirably chosen and sometimes proves to be a link between one scene and another (e.g., between Andrea's scene with her boyfriend Nate and the quick cut to the Urban Jungle shoot). (It is well worth buying the CD for the music, as I have done as well.) One has to see this movie more than one time and it is well worth doing so. It is easy to notice Meryl Streep's admirable performance at first, but another viewing lets one see the slow but perfect development of Andrea (an everyman -- or everywoman -- a Faustian character, e.g., Emily's comment: \\"I knew you sold your soul when you tried on your first pair of Jimmy Choo's.\\" But Stanley Tucci's (Nigel) and Emily Blunt's (Emily) roles are simply perfect as well. Even the minor characters, Nate and Christian, are really well done, though they are perhaps more \\"fifth business\\" rather than central characers, even though they are central characters, but somewhat sketchily developed. Nigel's (Tucci), \\"[Fashion] It's art, but greater than art, because it's something which you wear on your back -- well, not you, but some people,\\" etc. and the comment by the Newspaper Editor at the end of the movieabout some snooty girl, such a fun, perfect, snooty girl. One can see her other side when she tells Andrea's successor, \\"You have big shoes to fill.\\"     One can go on and on, one can comment on every scene, every line, but the sum of it is where I began. It is as if Miranda Priestly was in charge of everything and everyone did their job. (If the whole thing was a take on Vogue's Anna Wintour -- or her predecessors, Grace Mirabella or Diana Vreeland -- or her counterparts at other similar publications, like Harper's Bazaar, none of them should feel any objection at all, for in the end, they all did their job, or as Andrea told Christian, (paraphrase) \\"If it were a man doing Miranda's job, there would be no criticism.\\"    I watched the movie in the theater 10 times and on the DVD I watched it again, and then again with the Director's comments and the deleted scenes. The deleted scenes were wonderful, but, yes, they were rightly deleted from the movie itself, to pace it properly (so once again, everyone did their job).     The last time I was so impressed with a film was in 1979 with the movie \\"Time after Time,\\" starring Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenbergen and about H.G. Well's really having a time machine and coming to 1979 with Jack the Ripper a.k.a., his friend, a Doctor Stevenson. In that movie, there was only one scene (in the bank) which I thought didn't fit, but otherwise, well put together.     It isn't that a movie is (or attempts to be) profound. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" had profound intentions, trying to apply Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" to the Vietnam War, but it seemed like two movies, poorly connected together. Neither \\"Time after Time\\" nor \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" are profound in their intentions or suppositions, but they are extremely well done. Again, \\"everyone did their job.\\"     And comparing the talents of the author, Weisberger, in her novel to the movie, well, the movie (as is generally agreed)gives \\"the devil her due\\" and so manages to give greater insight from more than one perspective. On the other hand, Weisberger's conversational fluidity in her writing makes me think of the early Balzac who wrote pot-boilers and the later Balzac, inspired by his sister Laure to perfect his art. Weisberger has real talent, and if she wants to do more than just write best-sellers (which is not to be laughed at), but aspires to be remembered significantly by posterity as a writer, I think she can do it (and she probably has enough money now to be able to have the time and connections to do it, although if she lives in New York City, perhaps several million is not quite enough to feel settled for life without the need to worry about money. After all, what does even a Condo sell for in the Village. But if I say (as others do) that the movie is superior to the book, I want to emphasize that the book shows a real talent (for more than making money) which ought not to be laughed at.    I personally think this is the best movie of the year.
B000I2IT44|5.0|The \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\" DVD was recorded during Porcupine Tree's two-night stay at the Park West in Chicago on October 11-12, 2005.  Having seen their concert the night before at Bogart's in Cincinnati, I knew the Chicago audience was in for a treat.<br /><br />The song selection is mostly from 2005's \\"Deadwing\\" but also includes tracks from \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Recordings\\", \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"Stupid Dream\\".  The band was in top form and played for an appreciative audience.  One of the cool things that struck me about this concert was that the band chose to play a few semi-obscure B-sides like Revenant, Mother and Child Divided, and So Called Friend.<br /><br />Some have commented that they dislike the grainy film style of some of the shots favored by editor Lasse Hoile but I think it is visually interesting and definitely in keeping with Porcupine Tree's aesthetic.<br /><br />In addition to the first disc which includes the Chicago footage, a second disc includes two songs from a Rockpalast TV broadcast, the Lazarus music video, drummer Gavin Harrison's ultra fun and cool Cymbal Song, and a photo gallery.  A beautiful and haunting song plays over the photo gallery.  While this song has apparently not been titled or released before now, let's call it Gallery Music for the meantime.<br /><br />I have used the \\"Arriving Somewhere...\\" DVD to turn some of my friends into Porcupine Tree fans.  I highly recommend this DVD to die hard PT fans as well as people who have never heard the band.  You won't be disappointed.
B0006GQMC8|4.0|I enjoyed this film, typical of the 1970s Bronson Genre - quietly spoken tough guy. Lee Marvin also plays a good role as the knock about arm of the law - who feels more sympathy for Bronson's character than his pursuers. Angie Dickenson plays a less likely widow that becomes attracted to the much older Marvin - a common thread in the 70's for some reason - a bit unrealistic but it doesn't detract from the overall story and suspense. Enjoyable action scenes and a fantastic snow covered environment make this a movie worth buying.

B000JBXXZ4|5.0|I love this album. I am actually really surprised to read so many negative reviews about it. I think that this album is very creative, and that's all you can ask for as a listener from any musical artist that you enjoy listening to. There seemed to be a large portion of this album that was centered around Brandon Boyd's relationship problems and heartaches, and apparently, it degenerates the material in some listener's views. I think it makes it more personal and meaningful. But, to each his own...  <br />I have listened to Incubus for some time now, and I appreciate what they bring to the table as compared to other popular musicains. I enjoy their music as a whole, and I feel that they are in the upper tier of contemporary rock bands. <br />I think that this album is created perfectly from start to finish, but my tastes are unique and my own, and seemingly different than others... <br />I highly recommend this album. I really enjoyed listening to it. I don't particularly like pop radio, so I don't see the correlation with Incubus's sound and mainstream music... <br />Listen for yourself...

1400079179|1.0|In the middle of the night Professor Langdon receieves a phone call. He is informed that some guy is coming to get him out of his warm bed and take him to some crime scene, where there are strange signs and writings on the body of the victim. The trivia question is: \\"This is the beginning of ...\\" The answer is both \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", another novel by the same author. Dan Brown, without having any remorse of self pledgerism, starts his both novels with the same plot. Then we have the Indiana Jonesian adventures of some Harvard symbologist, who does not know neither French nor Italian (Indiana Jones was no archeologist, just a tomb raider, and so goes for Langdon. As a symbologist he is unable even to read the motto of the British coat of arms: \\"Dieu et mon droit\\". Even for qualifying exams at the Byzantine history program at Harvard you have to pass exams over four foreign languages, including French, German, Latin, and Ancient Greek. I cannot tell how many are required for a post at symbology. By the way, there is no symbology program at Harvard). So we end up with an unrealistic, a B movie type character, a good deal of popular conspiracy theories with full of misinformation, and some Holywood enchanced plots. Never try to compare it with any product signed by Umberto Eco.

B0006GAI6Y|4.0|\\"Shall We Dance?\\" should be required to include this statement: \\"WARNING: This film can be habit forming\\". The dancing is wonderful and the music mesmerizing - especially \\"Santa Maria\\", the song used in a tango sequence. The poignant story focuses on a successful middle-aged attorney who, although a happy family man, is wondering if this is all there is. Chance brings him to a failing dance studio where he emerges the star dancer in his class of three appealing adult male students. <br /> <br />This editor is not a fan of the three major actors in this film. However, each performed well and deserve credit for helping create a film that can be likened to the Energizer Bunny: It just keeps going and going (around in one's head).  <br /> <br />For its genre, this film deserves five stars but five should be reserved for a magnificent effort such as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".

B00003CXRM|4.0|\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" is a 20th-century version of Homer's epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\".  <br /> <br />The story focuses on three escaped prison-farm inmates who face a series of overwhelming odds in their effort to \\"seek the treasure\\" buried on the homeplace of the gang's self-appointed leader (played by George Clooney). A side impediment is Clooney's on-going effort to procure a tin of \\"Dapper Dan\\" hair pomade. His pompous \\"I'm a 'Dapper Dan' man\\" means he will not settle for a lesser brand. <br /> <br />Aside from getting to the treasure, Clooney's character has limited time to get to his hometown before his former wife marries another man. <br /> <br />Each disaster causes another delay in reaching the homeplace before it is relegated to the bottom of a brand-new lake. <br /> <br />The movie is liberally laced with knee-slapping humor and Depression-era country music (old-time Hillbilly) which is very well-executed (and, with one exception, lip-synched to singers who specialize in that genre). Even this editor, who has a life-long loathing of that kind of music, can't get enough of it! <br /> <br />Outstanding scenes include: a comic deep-south politico wonderfully portrayed by the marvelous Charles Durning; a hypnotic vocalization of \\"Go to Sleepy Little Baby\\" by the three \\"sireens\\" (sic); his normal outstanding performance by one of this editor's favorite thespians, John Goodman; and a blood-chilling KKK lynch-mob scene, the choreography for which can rival a Rockettes performance. <br /> <br />This is a motion picture most will enjoy watching any time and often! <br />

B0007Y08IS|5.0|THE PLOT: <br />When terrorists appear with WMDs, you can count on Team America. With the squeeze of a trigger, the destruction of international landmarks, and their theme song blaring, \\"Team America, #$%&@ , Yeah\\" our heroes prove that America will always be there to help-sorta. <br />Knowing Team America must infiltrate the terrorists cell, they recruit Gary Johnston, a rising broadway star. But after a failed attempt, Gary leaves, his self-confidence in shreds. Now Team America must guess where the next attack will take place. <br />As evil mastermind Kim Jong Il sets in motion his international terrorist plan, Gary must now decide whether to give up and allow his loved ones to die or buckup and try to save the day, Duh?. <br /> <br />MY TAKE: <br />It's not often that I get to say that a film is both thoroughly despicable and very enjoyable. The words that spring to mind when describing \\"Team America: World Police\\" are raunchy, filthy, crude and offensive, but also witty, hilarious, fun and \\"must see\\" for some. <br />This non-partisan film skewers both sides of the political fence and will wreak havoc with the Moral Majority. I've rarely heard such ribald language off of a golf course. What also distinguishes this film from many other twenty and thirty something films is the most explicit puppet sex ever put on film. I almost felt dirty when I laughed until I cried. <br />What will save this film from being relegated to a dusty DVD bin is the witty and intelligent writing by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of \\"South Park.\\" Not only is this film well balanced with a perfect blend of humor, cheesiness and drama, but the writing skill it takes to mesh all these into a seamless film that is both offensive and wildly entertaining is remarkable. Another saving grace is the puppets. One can get away with much more with puppets, especially marionettes. Their expressive eyes and facial features create just enough realism for emotional expression, but their movements (and thank goodness, their lack of anatomical correctness) separates them from animation and other mediums that strive for realism. <br />I would NOT recommend this film to those with easily offended sensibilities, nor those under the age of 17, but for \\"South Park\\" fans and for those who fall between the ages of 18-51, this film is a must see.

0618680004|5.0|Whether you are an atheist or not, Richard Dawkins' book The God Delusion is a striking and brilliant explanation of why religion shouldn't be heralded as the cause of our existence, and shouldn't run our lives. He brings such a compelling argument to this book, after you read it, you may never be the same. It gives the positive side of atheism, and explains why religion is truly a malevolent institution in our world, from its beginnings, to its current status. His main points explain how there is no such thing as a \\"muslim child\\" or a \\"christian child\\" and how teaching these doctrines to children at such a young age is the cause for such radical views of religion, and the main reason behind the fact that so many people inherit their parents beliefs. He goes on to tell how we don't need religion to be a moral people, and brings up unrefutable evidence against a higher being in my personal favorite chapter, \\"why there almost certainly is no god\\". Throughout the book, his incredible wit, unmatched rhetoric, and beautiful counter arguments all make this book essential to anyone who has ever questioned their parents beliefs, or who know they are atheist, and want to read a supportive \\"manual\\" on the subject! 5 Stars! Kudos to you Mr. Dawkins.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I watched this series as a child and was moved by the powerful images of war  <br />and the masterful narration of Laurence Olivier.  <br />The opening sequence to each episode set the tone for what was to follow.  <br />This is a comprehensive review of all the significant periods of World War Two  <br />and 30 years on, it still is as relevant and moving as ever. This series is a <br />\\"must see\\" for everyone, if only to serve as a reminder to the horrors and  <br />futility of war.
B000HBKCDC|4.0|I liked this CD a lot. It is typical Sarah McLachlan but I wanted that so I was happy with the purchase. It was a great price and I really liked her version of christmastime is here. The River always makes me wanna cry. overall a good addition to my holiday CD collection.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Don't let it's length put you off. Gettysburg's realism, action, cinematography and acting does for the Civil War what \\"Ryan\\" did for WWII movies. Unlike \\"Ryan\\", Gettysburg is a historical war epic in the true sense that faithfully reproduces  these calamitous days in America's and therefore world history (how different would the world be if the South had won?). <br /> <br />One for the critical officaido. <br /> <br />

B000J3EEBY|5.0|Once again, Loreena McKennitt's travels around our world have yielded a beautiful and poignant blend of emotionally charged paeans to earth and her inhabitants. From the meditative and shiver inducing first track to the final plea for mankind to recognize our shared fate, the album journeys to destinations of the heart and mind with her trademark sensitivity and skill. I especially like Penelope's song and the gates of Istanbul, but the entire CD is full of Loreena's unique melding of global sounds and her hopes for peace.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|Loreena has released some amazing albums over the years however, this album was the weakest. On the other hand, there are a few very good songs on this album. You would think after 10 years since her last release, that a great album would be coming our way.
1851774394|5.0|This book is chock full of close-up photographs which show the details of garments that have been well preserved from the period. Laden with eye-candy for costumers, history buffs, and those who appreciate beautiful things.  Readers will be amazed at the fine hand-work and examples of needlework shown on each garment.  Not just a beautiful \\"coffee table\\" book!  Well worth the purchase price!!
B00007GZR5|5.0|This movie depicted what I believe really happens.  It was a very bold move for Hollywood.  I wish they would do more.
0312330529|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read - and I have 4 bookcases full of books in my house. Absolutely fascinating, funny, terrifying, everything. I hope he will write more novels, because this is the best.
B00026WU82|5.0|No question.  This is one of the very greatest of all CDs in the rock and roll repertoire.  And it contains one of the very best rock and roll songs of all, \\"Like a Rolling Stone.\\"  Every song on the album is engaging, in its own unique way.  Some of the most evocative, image rich lines occur on this album.  This is Dylan's chef d'oeuvre and one of the best albums of all time.<br /><br />The CD begins with \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" a stunning song, featuring great keyboard work by Al Kooper and guitar work by Michael Bloomfield.  Lines abound that evoke images, such as:<br /><br />\\"Now you don't talk so loud,<br />Now you don't seem so proud<br />About scrounging your next meal.<br />How does it feel?\\"<br /><br />\\"Tombstone Blues\\" is an image filled cut.  Characters on this song include the Ghost of Belle Starr, Paul Revere's horse, the King of the Philistines, Jack the Ripper serving as the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, Ma Rainey and Beethoven, and Galileo.  The Commander-in-Chief sagely notes that \\"The sun's not yellow, it's chicken.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" portrays poor Mr. Jones as out of it.  The tag line here recurs over and over:<br /><br />\\"There's something happening here<br />But you don't know what it is<br />Do you, Mr. Jones.\\"<br /><br />And what about that underregarded \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\"  It starts off with a few great lines:<br /><br />\\"God says to Abraham, 'Kill me a son,'<br />Abe says 'Man, you must be puttin' me on.'<br />God says 'No,\\" Abe says 'What.'<br />God says, 'You can do what you want, Abe, but the next time you see me coming you better run!'<br />Abe says, 'Where do you want this killing done.'<br />God says, 'Do it out on Highway 61.\\"<br /><br />Later we see a promoter wanting to start the next world war--to be carried out on Highway 61.<br /><br />\\"Just like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" portrays what appears to be a trip to Juarez at Eastertime (and not a pleasant trip at that).  Sweet Melinda \\"Takes your voice and leaves you howling at the moon.\\"<br /><br />There follows a stunning long song, closing out the album, \\"Desolation Row.\\"  Here, we meet a host of characters living in this strange world, such as Romeo, Cindarella, Cain and Abel, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Einstein (who, oddly enough, is disguised as Robin Hood), Ophelia, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot.  One character ends up \\"Sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet.\\"<br /><br />The other three songs, \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,\\" \\"From a Buick 6,\\" and \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" are also engaging, although not as potent as the preceding songs.<br /><br />All in all, a genuine classic.re, we meet a host of characters living in this strange world, such as Romeo, Cindarella, Cain and Abel, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Good Samaritan, Einstein (who, oddly enough, is disguised as Robin Hood), Ophelia, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova, Ezra Pound, and T.

1881273156|5.0|This is a wonderful, easy-to-read explanation of why our best efforts to show our love to others sometimes go astray. You will be amazed at how often you will recognize yourself and your own experiences as the author describes how differently individuals hear and communicate deep feelings. This is a great read that can help any relationship become stronger, and may in fact save one that seems to be floundering.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Thank god this CD (or album, as some prefer) came out last year\summer.<br /><br />It was the only thing worth listening to.<br /><br />These guys are unbelievable.<br /><br />Prince has been replaced.
B000J10ERO|4.0|Good entertaining movie, though very violent in parts.  I wouldn't let children under 9 or so watch this.  The actor (I forget his name) who plays Superman does a great job of respecting the part.  It's almost a memorial to Christopher Reeve.  Kevin Spacey is a nicely creepy Lex Luther, but he's very violent, esp at the end.  Posey Parker (Parke Posey?) is annoying but adequate as Luther's moll.  The scenery and ideas are interesting.  If you're a Superman fan, you won't be disappointed.
B000002B5L|4.0|EXCELLENT MUSIC, BUT YOU HAVE TO LIKE RAP. THE LYRICS ARE A LITTLE GRAPHIC BUT NOT BAD. PARENTAL DISGRESSION IS ADVISED. BUT FOR THE MOST PART IS A GOOD CD.
B000I2J79K|3.0|I purchsed this item but had to return because I did not realize it is for an HD DVD and you need an HD DVD player to see it.  I bought for my husband but we have a regular DVD player and it was not compatible.  Be careful and make sure you have the right format before purchasing this HD DVD.
B000003CMB|5.0|It's almost pointless to add another 5-star review to this album. This is way beyond the categories of \\"Southern rock\\" (Lynyrd Skynyrd and Molly Hatchet belong in that dubious realm) and \\"blues rock\\" (hate to sound politically incorrect, but there's never been a blues performer or band that's even come close to what these guys were capable of). Duane Allman's slide guitar squalls with the kind of expression that will put the fear of God into you and make you forget, for a moment, who Jimi Hendrix was.  <br /> <br />Kiddies, this is what rock concerts used to be. Never mind! This is too real for you. Go back to blogging about how great fill-in-the-blank is.
0895260131|4.0|This book was a quick read. I was expecting more of an in-depth book that had more detail as to events and theories. For example the books Rise and fall of the third reich and Vietnam are books that are very detailed and lend credibility to their assessments and theories. Though the book was not bad, I found too much Christian vs Islam inuendo. On the pro side some of the statements made by the aurthor have proved to be true such as the new politically correct word 'Islamophobia'. More and more frequently I see this word being used by the press to describe American border security or some other conservative think tank that does not want to open the doors to just anybody entering this country. By reasoning of this book-A phobia is an unatural fear of something, for example if a madman had a gun to your head and his finger was on the trigger- you would be experiencing a fear of death and guns- this is NOT a phobia. Now when a person of middle eastern descent boards my plane, and knowing that 98% plus, highjackings and suicide bombings are perpetrated by middle easterners who practice islam, is that an unatural fear?. There are other examples and short stories that describe the ultimate goal of Islamic extremism, which is to turn everybody into worshippers of allah, even if they have to tax you or kill you to do it, and according to the author, this may not be limited to just the extremist. This book breifly describes the double standards of the religion along with the hypocrisy of the founder, a prolific fornicator, along with his perverted relatives- who offer their 7 year old daughter in marriage to him. There will be others who read my review and state that the author does not know anything about Islam, but unfortunatley the religion of Tolerance has not offered any intellectual rebuttal of the authors claim, just more Godless threats and murder. Read it and pass it on!! <br /> <br />
B000GIXEIG|1.0|The movie was faithful to the epic except trying to make one feel sorry for Grendel with a bogus opening scene.  This I could lived with but the story dragged and the screenplay was as vague to point that if you did know the story you would be lost or certainly would not have cared.  The actors were liveless (sort of like Anakin Skywalker Star War 3).   <br />    In short, I heard of this movie by accident and that should have told me something.
0142000655|5.0|In what is truly a masterpiece on many levels, John Steinbeck delivers with East of Eden a compelling tale of two families whose lives in the Salinas Valley are fascinating and seemingly intertwined. This novel began as merely a required piece for school, but as I read on, I found myself unable to put it down, often reading late into the night. The characters are realistic and masterfully tied together, their lives tied together, as if by fate. The plot provokes the mind, raising philosophical questions that opened to me different ways to view the world and choices in life. Steinbeck's story-telling is simply wondrous, saturating the novel with detailed descriptions and narration. The fact that this is the centennial edition, still wildly popular and discussed more than a hundred years after it was written, is testament to the allure of the novel. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, regardless of age, as it is an exploration of some of the most important ideals in our society. Steinbeck even stores the essence of the 601 pages into one word- thimshel, a word as important and essential to the story as carpe diem is to Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society, both tales that have enabled me to view the world in a different light, and help me become a better person as a whole.
B000I5X81K|3.0|i think his previous 2 albums were better,more personal, more loving.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward Norton plays an Illusionist who's life changes when a girl he couldn't be with in his past re-enters his life. She's played by Jessica Biel and the Prince (Rufus Sewell) wants to marry her and he's used to getting what he wants. Norton and Biel want to be together but they know the Prince will have them killed if they try to runaway together. After someone is murdered, the chief inspector (Paul Giamatti) has his eyes on Norton.<br /><br />  The Illusionist is a beautifully done movie. It's well acted, well filmed and a well told fairytale. Rufus Sewell deserves some credit here as the Prince. Yes he has played similar roles in the past but he manages to make this performance different a little than his usual villian performance. It's a little closer to Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Gladiator than Sewell's villian performance's in A Knight's Tale or The Legend of Zorro. I think he gives one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />  Paul Giamatti also has a better role here than he did Lady in the Water. He was wasted there but here he's fantastic and pretty much owns every scene he's in. Biel also handles a serious role fine as well and gives a better performance than she has in any movie. I'm talking about Norton less because you already know he's good of course. I love everything about this movie, even the musical score is well done.
B000I2IT44|5.0|i give this concert five stars.  it met my expectations.  great lighting on the stage.  very nice drum work by gavin harrison.
B00005JNS0|4.0|I really like this feature length animated film.  It's a lot of fun for the entire family and holds up to repeated viewings.  The vocal performances by the cast are very nicely executed, it has a sweet moral integrity message, and EXCELLENT production quality overall.  As an adult, however, I can't rate it up there with the best of this genre, which (in my opinion) include \\"The Invincibles,\\" \\"Toy Story,\\" \\"Nemo,\\" or \\"Shrek\\" for a few reasons.  Although good, the writing seems a little less sophisticated, the jokes aren't quite as clever, and the plot is not as imaginative as one would hope.  That said, \\"Cars\\" is a fine flick that I'm very happy to own.
B00004TWZF|5.0|A true masterpiece. I viewed the cut down version movie years ago, and was thrilled with this longer version, it is almost a new film with all the extra scenes. The DVD will work on multizone players, I stay in South Africa and thought it would not work with the new coding and c**p that the Americans are now introducing, a real paranoid bunch they are, but it played fine.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I've loved this movie for a long time.  I tried buying it, but it was not available here.  I have a friend who owns a rental place and he gave me the screener.  I finally decided to spend the money to get the DVD, and even though I already HAD the movie, the extra features were worth the price of the DVD.
B000KC86F4|5.0|To date, this is the only title on Blu-Ray that offers DTS-ES HD Master Audio, and the sound is unrivalled. I was playing it on DTS-Encore, through an optical cable on my existing home theater system (without DTS HD decoding) and I could hear things that I couldn't on its DVD counterpart (I tested them back-to-back). Imagine what it would sound like on its full HDMI-DTS HD potential. <br /> <br />Other than that, this title has nothing to offer. The movie itself is nothing great, and the picture is bad. Very bad indeed. The grains are in full effects here. Whether it is due to the digital film-making or lack of foresight to use a dual layer disc, it really kills the fun in testing out this BD. If the picture wasn't so bad, this would be the perfect demo BD. Now you'll have to go buy another title just to test the picture!
B000059QYB|5.0|This CD is one of the best greatest hits CD's I have heard in a long time. There are no songs that aren't worth hearing over and over again. Best value for the money I have made in a long time.
0920668364|5.0|This is not just a children's book; it's a book for life!  I love it and give it to every child I know.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The plot had an old fashioned, downhome feel with a somewhat modern (or perhaps timeless) theme. The hyjinx was enjoyable, and the singing was a fun surprise!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The best price that I could find on this COMPLETE FRIENDS SERIES anywhere. <br />My 19 year old daughter only requested this for her Christmans gift as she's a super fan.  It comes packaged in a classy box,that includes a book with quick synopsis of each episode. Audio commentary is another feature. The synopsis also lets you know which episodes that had a guest star.  Money well spent for the ultimate Friends fan!
B000H305U0|5.0|I must say that I am a rocker that gave in to this pop star! Justin Timberlake made an amazing album. First sucked in by his singles, I am even more in love with other songs on the track list including \\"Lovestoned\\" and \\"What Goes Around.\\" Definitely a wonderful pick!
0618680004|5.0|This is a book I will reread a few more times, primarily because of its underlying tone of rationality and not necessarily the topic of the argument.  Very well written and researched-I'm now reading some of the books used for reference.  Since about, ummm, the age of 5, I've been suspecious of all religions-in particular those dealing with the God of Abraham.  The problems that can be associated with political ideals pale in magnitude with those of religion.  We are children of the Universe and are capable of thinking, it's time we did so.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I bought this one as a gift, and they LOVE it!  I'm sure I will too, as I love everything by Josh.  Once I buy it and hear it for myself, I'll know whether to upgrade this rating to 5 stars.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|It is like Deva Premal is making love thru her music. Perfect.
0205313426|5.0|The book was more in depth than I thought it would be, and is a wonderful tool for writing school papers. I learned a lot, and it reinforced things that I had learned in the past.
0375831002|5.0|This is a lovingly written coming of age story of a young girl who has had more than her share of suffering before she reached her teens.  Her pain will continue throughout the story.  Yet her humanity and connections with all those around her draws you in and you won't want to let go.<br />The author tells you much of what will happen at the beginning of the book.  A less skilled writer would have lost me as a reader after that.  Afterall, we all know the first rule of writing fiction is \\"Show, don't tell.\\"  Zusak breaks rules and draws you in and you never want to let go of his characters.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone over 15.
1400064287|5.0|If you need to communicate ideas, if you are a businessperson, marketer, teacher, clergyperson, politician, parent or spouse, you need this book. <br /> <br />If you are a reader of Malcolm Gladwell, if you enjoyed any of Seth Godin's books, if you want to stay out of a bathtub filled with ice with one of your vital organs removed, you need this book. <br /> <br />Seriously, Chip and Dan have taken a concept that was briefly introduced in Gladwell's The Tipping Point -- the characteristics of ideas that are memorable and longstanding -- and turned it into a recipe book for constructing memborable stories. <br /> <br />The book is organized around a set of six powerful principles that anyone can use to transform themselves into more effective communicators.  It's written with humor and real-life examples that make it a quick read, but also one that \\"sticks\\" with you long after you put it down. <br /> <br />Keep one for yourself and buy copies for everyone who inflicts PowerPoint presentations on you at work.  You'll be glad you did.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Great movie, great writing and very compelling.  I even got over Godfather 3's initial reaction - considering his daughter Sofia was just starting out, she did pretty good in the role of Corleone's daughter.  The bonus disc was worth getting it all together.  Great price and a classic.  Thanks for offering it at such a bargain. :)
0618680004|1.0|Richard Dawkins starts out by telling his four goals, including consciousness raising; freeing people from the moral slavery that is religion; showing the power of Darwinian explanations; and, it seems, calling all religions and believers by a bunch of names.  At least I think that must be the fourth goal, and certainly his most successful.  This is a book by an angry name-calling evangelist for atheism.<br /><br />He then stumbles into a major mistake.  He believes that believers have as their central goal tried to prove the existence of God, and he therefore believes he can use his mind and rationality to counter by proving that God does not exist.  His mistake is obvious to any Hindu, Buddhist, Christian.... These religions are not founded merely on proofs, they are founded on faith.  His refutations are therefore a misguided project, from the start.<br /><br />But attack he does.  He takes on many of the major arguments for the existence of God, with a combination of invective, straw-man arguments, and occasional insights.  The result is angry and sophomoric.<br /><br />Why is it a mistake to believe that religions offer only proofs for God's existence?  Look to Isaiah, Chapter 55:  \\"My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways<br /><br />higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.\\"  Look to Chapter 59.<br /><br />\\"We stumble at noon as in the twilight,<br /><br />Among the vigorous as though we were dead.<br /><br />We all growl like bears;<br /><br />Like doves we moan mournfully.<br /><br />We wait for justice, but there is none;<br /><br />For salvation, but it is far from us.<br /><br />For our transgressions before you are many,<br /><br />And our sins testify against us. \\"<br /><br />Judaism and Christianity are based on a set of beliefs that God is far greater than people can encompass, that man is limited, or fallen.  Buddhism cites humbleness as a major virtue of the Buddha, and one of the reasons for the depiction of his clothes, his stances, his teachings.  Any proofs for the existence of God, even famous ones like those of Aquinas, start with one foot in a barrel of cement, a hubristic human impulse to encompass God within the human mind.<br /><br />Dawkins does a poor job of executing his attacks on these theorists for God.  Each argument is in turn caricatured, and then ridiculed.  He could weave baskets with his straw men.  In any freshman composition class, writers are required to accurately depict the thoughts of their sources before attacking them... Dawkins would fail freshman comp on this ground alone.<br /><br />But to be fair, he also makes a crucial case for his position, summarized on page 157 of the hard cover version.  His six point proof for the non-existence of God is really about two points, maybe only one.  It boils down to an argument that claims the Universe is designed are illogical claims, because who would have designed the designer?  Gotcha says the sophmore!<br /><br />This is merely a banal re-statement of Parmenides refutation of Plato's forms - there is no designer because a designer would have to be in turn designed, and that designer in turn designed.  In other words, logic chopping.  Philosophy 301.  The answer to this sort of logic chopping, the religious equivalent of Zeno's Paradox, is to say no, that is not necessarily the case by any logic or real world experience.  Sometimes a designer is just a designer without endless recursion.  Maybe even with God...<br /><br />But Dawkins uses this banal and incorrect insight, which he cites as his central point, to make the great leap.  In two short further paragraphs he says that \\"If the premise of this Chapter is accepted the factual premise of religion is untenable.\\"<br /><br />What?  He offers as proven a point he barely takes the room to make, a proof he barely offers!  This is the great hoodwinking buried under the invective and bile.  Dawkins is a man without a chest, unable to make so much as a decent paragraph out of his central proof, a vain and puffed up stuffed shirt for atheism.  Oops, I just slipped into Dawkinsian argumentation.  Mea culpa.<br /><br />The book never engages a central tenet or voice of any faith, and instead chooses to cite every bad person associated with faith, every fringe character in religion trotted out in a tour that is peripatetic and unfair.  He cannot talk about a faith without using the perversions of that faith as his text.<br /><br />Within the flow of his invective there are so many specific points that can be refuted that one grows tired.  Here is one, just as an example:  He gets the point of John Paul II's veneration (not worship, veneration, which is a different word) of Mary exactly wrong.  JP venerated Mary because she was entirely human - facing choices just like other humans do, without the resources of God - and not because she was some sort of co-God, or out of a polytheistic impulse.  Dawkins misreads this as a polytheistic impulse of the Pope, and his mis-reading here is either ignorant or willful.  Coincidentally, this allows him to snicker at JPII rather than engage his points.<br /><br />See, here is the point.  Maybe God does not exist.  But Dawkins is so bitter and angry, and argues in such a wrong-headed fashion, that a reader is left wondering where the smart atheists are, who can make a real case against the existence of God, where to turn for an intelligent debunking of faith...  I would not say that Dawkins is so bad as to back a reader into faith, but he is just bad enough to back any intelligent reader out of atheism, especially out of rabid evangelical atheism.  At the very least, readers will be bound over to ennui and disgust over their $27 miss-spent dollars.<br /><br />  Such a stupid bright man, such a dishonest clever book.ve and bile.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|With a truly brilliant voice, Michael Bublé pays tribute to all those before him with songs done by legends past.  I'm not sure if any of the songs are his own, but I'm not complaining.  He's great!  Highly recommended!
B00068NVI4|5.0|Even with band members pushing 60 years of age this group still manages to be the powerhouse they ever were. Load this HD-DVD into a nice system and you are in for a treat -- finally Yes in a dazzling high-tech format. Yes fans already know the songs and the players but I was grateful to see and hear Rick Wakeman and also their suped-up version of \\"Southside of the Sky\\" that contains blistering exchanges between Steve Howe and Wakeman -- one of the many highlights. Jon Anderson also sounds remarkable. I hope they all can keep it up for many more years to come.

B000IOM1RI|3.0|I'm sure it's my own fault, but I expected more than just the musical in this album.  I was hoping for more songs.
B000002OVJ|5.0|If you ever wondered what the allure of the Who was; this cd will explain all. It has the original lineup and they all sound great. The best version of Magic Bus is performed brilliantly. This is a must have for any WHO fan.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Got here when it was promised, and as it was promised.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This cd is great I enjoy all the music of Josh Groban.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This album spawned a few well loved classics - Changes, Life on Mars - but also contains some of the best early Bowie has to offer including a tribute to Andy Warhol, and a song dedicated to Bowie's then little boy (Kooks). It has a funky, folksy sound completed by quirky, poetic lyrics that are signature Bowie. Hunky Dory feels a lot more sentimental than most of his work ... a young man, misunderstood, writing songs about those who influenced him and those who tried to keep him down. A great addition to any collection - or just a place to explore a different David Bowie sound than most are used to.
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift is one of those albums that will forever stand the test of time. Although \\"Man in the Box\\" gave Alice in Chains their big break, songs like \\"We Die Young\\", \\"Ain't Like That\\", \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", \\"Bleed the Freak\\" and \\"Put You Down\\", just to name a few, proved they were no one hit wonder.<br /><br />Layne Staley's vocals really shine on this album. When do they not, right?<br /><br />Get this album.....You won't be disappointed!
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins is brilliant.  This book articulates and validates what I have always beleived.  \\"The God Delusion\\" should be required reading for every elected official and every educator on planet Earth.  Atheists unite.
B000IY03CS|3.0|I am a US fan of George Michael.  Not having the \\"patience\\" (pun intended) to wait for the US release of the Twenty Five Deluxe edition (or any edition) I purchased the import version of this set.  Every version so far that I have seen has the same track listing.  I must admit.  I have every GM cd, even the Japanese version of patience with Please Send Me Someone (alternate) which is so much better than the standard album version.  So you could say I'm an avid GM collector.  Anyway.  I bought this set for the few new songs that were on there.  I am a completionist and OCD :).  Anyway, the new songs are average.  The old material sounds great but this collection is missing many key tracks as mentioned by Yamato.  I wish the For The Loyal disc contained nothing but new or at least rare material, where is Crazyman Dance, Happy, Do You Really Want To Know, Edith And The Kingpin or The Grave.  Those tracks a great and would have added some appeal to buying the deluxe version.  If you have no GM albums ladies and gentlemen might be a better place to start.  If you are a die hard you will probably get this anyway, just like I did.  Its not a bad package, although I hate digipacks in every shape and form.  Lot of great pictures of GM and lyrics of all the songs.  The rareties if you don't have Older And Upper or the Spin The Wheel single include Safe and You Know That I Want To are great tracks.  Not sure where Fantasy originated from.  Heal The Pain w Paul McCartney really doesn't do much for me, its not bad, but not great either.  I think the Loyal who buy the 3 disc version get more rare tracks than the four included.  I love GM, but this set was a little disappointing.  I hope we get a new album again.  Would love to see GM do a double album of new material.  He could do it and we know it would be great.
B000H305U0|5.0|I loved it!!!!  It will get up on the dance floor.  It shows he took his time to make this CD, and not rushed it.  I would recommend everyone to buy it -- well worth the money!
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Even though this movie was made in recent times I can see it becoming a classic.  I'm not sure how this movie went with little notice but it is worth watching.  It will make you believe in love again.
B000J10ERO|5.0|thank you very much.....everything was perfect, the condition of the product <br />and the time it took to arrive....which was just a couple days ,....again thank you.
B000009HF2|5.0|Possibly the best live album ever. But then there is Four Way Street. 30 years ago I never thought I would be writing a review on a computer. This album certainly passes the test of time.
0679720200|5.0|thought provoking, well written. <br />short but excellent read. <br />great to discuss with others with more than half a brain.
B00004TWZF|5.0|The Big Blue is a movie about dream of ocean. This movie and Atlantis both are my favorite movies.
B00000JBFW|5.0|This album brings back a lot of memories for me.  A friend of mine and I took a driving  trip from Michigan to New Orleans shortly after this album came out, and it was constantly on our playlist during the drive.  By 1984 many people had pretty much written Deep Purple off.  They had not released an album as a band since 1975.  Blackmore formed Rainbow, Gillian had his own band as well as a stint with Black Sabbath, and Glover and Paice had joined Whitsnake.  Deep Purple had effectively dropped off the radar.  \\"Perfect Strangers\\" would see the return of the mark II lineup of Glover, Blackmore, Gillian, Lord, and Paice and would prove to be one hell of a comeback.  Personally this is my all time favorite Deep Purple album.  Every song is great, the music is a perfect mix of the classic purple sound with an updated (for its time) contemporary feel.  Two big AOR hits came from the album, the opener \\"Knocking At Your Back Door\\" and the title track \\"Perfect Strangers\\"  Both songs rank with the best the band has ever done in fact the song \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is one of the best songs of the 80's in my book.  The rest of the album is all great too.  \\"Wasted Sunsets\\" is a ballad that Ian Gillian just kills.  His voice is perfect for the song as he does what he does best belting it out.  \\"Hungry Daze\\" is a rocking look back at the band's history and a look forward to their future.  \\"Under The Gun\\", \\"Nobody's Home\\", \\"Mean Streak\\" \\"Gypsy's Kiss\\"  and \\"Not Responsible\\" are all excellent as well.  I got to see the band on this tour and the show was as good as the album.  Sadly Deep Purple would follow \\"Perfect Strangers\\" with the lousy \\"House Of Blue Doors\\" which was a huge letdown after this one, and would be the last album from the mark II version of the band.
B000HCO840|5.0|I am a big fan of the X-men series and after buying this version I must say I was completelly astonished by the quality of the images, the extra material and the package in which it is stored. <br />
B000051VWW|5.0|I borrowed 'Lover Rock' from my father years ago and played it over and over again till it got scratched up! He would always ask for me to return it and I  always promised I would.  Then last Christmas Eve of 2006, after buying toys for my niece's kids I decided as I walked into 'Virgin Records' to buy 'Lovers Rock' & 'Love Deluxe' as a gift to both my parents as a way to say I'm sorry and I love you. . .unfortunately my Dad was in Florida on Christmas Day (a Monday) but when he returned that weekend I made him open the gift over the phone - he was so surprise!!!  Everytime I see \\"By Your Side\\" the music video and catch the part of elderly couple dancing togerther with Sade in the snow - I think of my parents:)
B000I0QK74|3.0|Perhaps we can sometimes expect just a little too much from one of our greatest singer songwriters, James Taylor. With his trademark spellbinding chocolatey velvet voice (to which I am sure many a child has been lovingly conceived), James manages to stay just on the right side of being schmaltzy (if that's how you spell it). However, at the risk of sounding blasphemous before his millions of faithful followers, I confess that I was left feeling mildly disappointed. An album that is beautifully executed, beautifully performed and is yet ultimately rather souless and bland (albeit in a beautiful sort of way).  <br /> <br />A christmas album with a lighter jazzier feel, but a christmas album nonetheless and one that will probably only be played once or perhaps twice a year. My recommendation is to audition first before buying... and yes, I would consider myself to be one of his disciples.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Dark movie about the slippery path people fall down when they have no options.  Put a group of real estate scam-artist salesmen in a contest where first prize is a cadillac, 2nd is a set of steak knives, and third is a pre-Trump You're Fired, and then wonder at the depths people will go... <br /> <br />And what a cast!  Lemmon is his usual strange mix of sympathetic annoyance.  Pacino is the great salesman.  Kevin Spacey is strong as the middle manager whose own plight turns into sadism.  And Baldwin, he steals the show laying out the Steak knife challenge.   <br /> <br />Don't come in expect a classic buddy movie - this is dark, dreary, and never regains the energy of the sales pep talk.  But it's not supposed to - that's the point.
B0000A0DRY|4.0|Really enjoyed this disc, as it brought back the sound and mood of my  <br />teen years; also played it for a \\"young person\\" under 21,and had to order her a copy !!!! <br />Good selection of tunes.....
1582701709|4.0|I actually think the book \\"The Secret\\" is very good and offers the information in an easily understandable format. However, it is literally a word for word duplication of the movie and therefore a waste of money for anyone who already owns the movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I bought this for my grandchildren but found it quite interesting myself. I especially liked the documentary containing information about the people behind the voices. Amazon's service was excellent.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I heard this CD playing in Barnes and Nobles last year. I knew after the 1st song that I had to have it and it is by far the best CD I have bought in a very long time.  The songs are soul stirring, heart-felt and soothes the listener like no one else!
0804102988|5.0|This is a great book.  Once you start you will not want to put it down.  <br />Delivery was fast.
0061122416|3.0|Although a good moral of the story, I saw the ending coming from the second page. The gist does help put life into perspective, however. If you are a soul looking for happiness, stay in your very own backyard. <br />Either that, or one man's garbage is another's treasure. Or maybe, the grass really IS greener on the other side. You could see it any of those three ways.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|The Homecoming:Live In Orlando Backstreet Boys Music DVD is an awesome Music DVD because you can have alots of fun with Nick Carter,A.J.McLean,Brian Littrell,Howie Dorough,and Kevin Richardson,you can learn so much about them,and you can learn theirs's awesome dance moves,too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And they're a much talented boyband/guygroup than NSYNC and they're much better singers,dancers,and songwriters than NSYNC,too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000JJS8TM|5.0|The \\"Love\\" album in an amazing accomplishment for Sir George Martin and son.  This is the first time anyone has been given access to the original Beatles recordings -- all of them (raw tracks, rehearsals, alternates, etc.).  This album takes some songs an decomposes them down to the bare essence (\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"). Others (\\"Here Comes the Sun\\") are remixed with Indian instruments to add a new thematic dimension. Others are shameless, rocking \\"mashups\\" of familiar Beatles songs. <br /> <br />As a die-hard fan, I was skeptical at the synthesis of \\"new\\" Beatles songs, but I have been dazzled.  I am appreciating these songs in a new way.  They come to life on modern stereo and surround sound gear.  This is a \\"must have\\" for an Beatles fan.
B000ENV2P0|5.0|I bought this box set even though I already had the Stadium Arcadium CD's.  This product is a great addition to my collection.  It includes a DVD with comments from the band about the songs on Stadium Arcadium.  And the shadow box is really neat.  Plus the little goodies that are included.  I really enjoy this purchase and I believe anyone who listens to the Red Hot Chili Peppers will want to buy this box set.
0143057375|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's wisdom can change the consciousness of the planet in a mind blowing way (pun intended). If we all read or listened to this book and put into practice the awareness he counsels, our heart's desires would be realized and the planet would be at peace....Read and awaken!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A thought-provoking film on global warming.  It has the power to convert even \\"non-believers\\" into believers.  Everyone should see this film.
B0001O3YCG|5.0|I mainly purchased this movie as the first companion to The Chronicles of Riddick. I actually liked this movie, however I liked the \\"Chronicles\\" better.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Very funny!  John Cleese is hilarious as is the entire cast.  Its only a shame they didn't make more episodes.  I highly recommended this for Monty Python lovers and anyone who loves to laugh. <br />
B000EJ9VUW|1.0|this is a sad attempt for the Liars at taking their sound in a new direction. It comes off as a hearted rip off of \\"Animal Collective's\\" \\"Feels\\" album, which was amazing. This disc doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it, and conventional wisdom is starting to tell me that Pitchfork has gotten too big for there britches.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|It is one thing to listen to these guys, it is a totally different experience if you get to see them.<br /><br />Mega efficiency in the way these people play their instruments.  If you are a musician, you'll not only get the pleasure of watching the best band in the world do its thing, but you'll learn something about how to execute some sweet action moves.
B000FWHVKA|2.0|What gives? This album is far from spectacular.  The only thing that keeps this album from receiving a 1 star rating is the fact it fails to annoy.  But on that same token it fails to stimulate on any level higher than elevator music. This is another massivly overrated album from a pretty poor year in music that was 2006. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy experimental music as long as it has some stimulating value (i.e. sonicly creative, foot tapping beats, or emotionaly deep). I fail to make any connection with this cd, on any level.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|Old stuff, new stuff - this is an excellent CD.  The music will blow your minds.<br /><br />The only compliant is on the song \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".  Unlike original recording, there are no separate tracks for each of the movements of this song.  So if you are like me, and like to advance to particular movements, you'll have to get used to using the FF button on your CD player.
B00011F5DK|5.0|As a teacher of talented and gifted students, I have used Blokus with students in grades 2-4.  I have never had a student who didn't love this game.  Along with \\"Apples to Apples,\\" this game is my students' favorite.  I recently suggested Blokus as a gift for parents to give their children for the holidays, and I have had a number of  students happily report that they received it.  The game has appeal for all ages; my teenagers and I have fun playing it in our own home.  While the game is easy to understand and play, it can also be challenging.  It involves good spatial awareness, strategy development, eye-hand coordination, and just plain old fun.
B000002AQQ|5.0|When you need to get your mojo back, this CD might help.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is a great family movie (so is entertaining for both parents and children) with good teachings and fun characters. Beware! Your children will want all the Cars merchandise to go along with the movie...
0671027573|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read!  It's a comedy, romance, and cop thriller all wrapped up in one.  Since then, I've read almost all of her books and enjoyed them, too.  I've bought this book and given it to several people who have all now started reading Linda Howard books.
0736063684|5.0|I really like how the art shows the exact muscles you'll be using for any particular exercise. I could never picture it as accuarate as the book shows it. I really like how the chapters are broken up too,(arms, legs, back, etc.) It will be a great addition to your library.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This classic is the BEST Christmas Movie of the entire bunch!  Our family and a number of friends watch it every year before Christmas.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|This is another of those movies definitely made for adults. It may give your children nightmares, but the point of the movie is not to be scary; it's to be funny, and it is. This movie made me laugh out loud over and over again. It is especially rewarding if you've seen the original Dawn of the Dead, but funny even if you don't get all the references to that cult classic. There are a number of visual gags you may miss the first time you see it because the movie doesn't always call attention to them. Worth buying because this is one you'll probably want to watch more than once.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|A good buy, but with a few exceptions, lacks the musicality of the first record. Most of the tracks have the driving guitar, but not the beautiful melodies of Evanescence's first album. The one track that I feel matches the caliber of their first album is \\"Call me when you're sober.\\" My suggestion is to listen to it first before you buy.
0307237699|5.0|This book by Barack Obama was terrific as welll as insightful look into politician life and beginnings of how effectively to real start  change in our nation. <br />Kim
B00007GZR0|5.0|If you enjoy Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies, you will love this cute movie.  While it doesn't contain the violence or foul language that permeates the movies of the past 20 years, it merely entertains, providing a fun escape from life.  Tony Randall is great, as usual, and the movie provides the typical Hudson/Day comedy.  No special effects, just good, clean humor.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|this movie was a true eye opener. some people do not like Al Gore, but the simple display of the truth is compelling and undeniable. please see this movie.
1596912367|4.0|The characters in Restless are so appealing it is hard to put the book down until they play out their parts in the novel.  The story never slows down, is never too much to believe and has a facination in the details of \\"spying.\\"  I read it in one sitting and wished it could have gone on longer.
B000002NHN|5.0|This type of music is not for everyone, needless to say... However, if you like vocals with a mix of Celtic/New-Age, you'll LOVE this CD. I like to play it in the car when I'm driving long distances. It helps to put me in a \\"happy place\\" while all the aggressive drivers around me give themselves ulcers/migraines.
B000J103X4|4.0|despite the reveiws ive read on this album dissing it,i found it to be a great album,even thoo dr dre didnt handel beat production,they are still on point,and the game has layed off the anti g-unit lyrics on this cd,even thoo game has a stack off mixtapes,cop this album,i liked it......
B00004XPPB|5.0|An absolute classic from beginning to end. A twisted love story interwinded within the mafia between an ageing mafioso(Al Pacino) and an FBI undercover agent (Johnny Depp). In short this film tells the story of undercover agent Joe Pistone, using the alias Donnie Brasco to infiltrate the mafia. He meets Lefty 'two guns'Ruggiero played superbly by Al Pacino who immediately befriends him and thorugh him Donnie Brasco antoher stellar performance from Johnny Depp manages to enter the mob and learn first hand the true workings of the mafia. This films defers from any other mob film in the fact that it focusses on a strong friendship based on a lie; that could kill any one of them. Lefty is an ageing mafioso who besides his quirks and misfortunes is slipping fast, never would he have not realised that Donnie was an agent back in the days. Set in the early 80's in New York City, this story is one that must be seen and heard and this film gives this unforgettable encounter true justice. It is a must have for any true crime, film noir, mafia movie collector.  <br /> <br />The special features on this DVD are few but insightful, there is also an interview with the real life Donnie Brasco who also served as a technical adviser on the movie. We also get to meet the superb cast behind the scenes. The likes of Al Pacino , Johnny Depp, Michael Madsen, Anne Heche et all, help in making this movie so great. <br /> <br />Enjoy the film!!! you will not be dissappointed!!!
0743298020|5.0|In order to enjoy this type of story, it was necessary for me to suspend all sense of reality. Since I have trouble with reality anyway, it was not difficult.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pervasive sense of mystery surrounding the  <br />twins'  history. The lack of inappropriate four letter words was a joy.  My only disappointment was the relationship between Vida and Margaret. I kept waiting for  more depth of character to develop with them. <br />It never happened. All the same, a great read.
0380713802|5.0|We're planning a trip to Europe and this book gives a lot of information you don't get from a travel guide, and it's all done with a lot of humour.  This is great reading even if you don't want to pick up those quirkly tips.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|College days collection.  Makes me want to join a POS frat house and tear it up! Good times.
0395389496|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a child.  It came in perfect condition and it was adored by its recipient.  Cute pictures and story.
B00008PC2O|5.0|it's hard to beat this movie.. controversially better than the original!  Loved this movie growing up! The extreme edition is nice. All a collector could want
B000HEVZ9O|5.0|My dad loved the collection, which was a Christmas gift.  He got it in a timely fashion and has watched all three movies.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We (my family and I) found this movie to be consequent with the standard set by Pixar and comparable to movies such as  Nemo and Monsters Inc. It supports good sportsmanship, is easily understood and in my opinion enjoyable for all ages.
B000C1YPY4|5.0|The best music i heard for a long time.i had sacd version.very very good.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Have been a fan of the Beatles since the beginning, very familiar with all of their tunes. The remastering of these tracks are amazing. Put the DVD Audio disc in your player, sit in the sweet spot of your of audio system and enjoy. You will not be diappoonted and you will spiritually be transported back in time.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|Loving this version of Charles Dickens \\"A Christmas Carol\\" after seeing it in the theatre, I bought the VHS version (which I would give 5 stars) several years ago and watched it every Christmas.  This year I decided I would update and add it to my DVD collection.  For those who saw it in the theatre and later on tape, you may have noticed an entire scene/song missing.  When the young Ebenezer is discussing marriage plans with his future bride Belle, she decides to leave and sings The Love is Gone.  Michael Caine sings a duet with here during the second part of the song.  This scene has been removed.  Belle just simply gets up and walks away.  This was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.  I'm curious to know why it was removed.   Not for copyright reasons because the song is sung during the credits.  For those of you who have the VHS version, stick with that version.  It's complete.
B00005LC1H|5.0|<br />Possibly, with Black Adder, the best and funniest series ever done. The John Cleese <br />of Monty Python is the superbly arrogant and incompetent  Basil; Manuel (he's from <br />Barcelona) will bleat \\"I know nawthing...\\" and Sybil, on the phone, will endlessly <br />repeat \\"I knaow...I knaow...\\" to her equally irascible friends. <br /> <br />Classic, disarmingly funny, quotable and a joy forever. Buy the package. Infrequent  <br />appearances on PBS are nowhere near enough.   <br /> <br />
B00004Z4WR|4.0|The execution of this film defies credibility but some outrageous character portrayals and performances make this film entertaining. I found some car enthusiasts who really like this film and others who find it ludicrous and berate it. After all is said it does not fail to entertain.
B000I5X824|5.0|I thought this cd was a very good one.  If you're a fan of Staind then this is a must have.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|It's a very good album with a mixture of rythms and sounds. I recommend listen to it to everybody!!!!
B000059T00|5.0|This album is a \\"TRUE\\" classic.The songs are a delightful musical mix of vocals and instruments that allow you to listen to this album over and over and never tire of it.One can only imagine what heights this group could have attained having broken up and gone their seperate ways after the making of this album.But at least there is this one to enjoy.
0812975219|5.0|What a wonderfully important piece to the great puzzle.  My son-in-law read this before he went to Dartmouth for graduate school, and I got them to give me a copy for Christmas.  I liked it so much that I ordered some extras to share with my friends.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|really poor remake of a popular tv show, to much violence, not a good match on main stars
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Whether you are a little blue or like reaching for beyond the stars- there is a song on the Wicked soundtrack that will fit your mood.  It's an uplifting musical with lyrics that can deeply touch the heart.  It takes you right into the scenes and allows you to experience what music is meant to bring to the heart.  It is a must for any music lover's collection.
055358202X|5.0|This book furthers several story threads. The pacing is good and the stories from each character stand alone as well as intertwine in ways that show a mature writer at work. Like Steven Erikson, Good and Evil are not clear cut and are far too simplistic for daily life. Motivations based on self-interest at times have beneficial effects for groups of people, cultures, etc. Honorable intentions, likewise, can cause great harm to families, villages, etc. Most of all it is just a well told story. Further works in this series will be welcome.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|Thank-you Gwen!  This is perfect.  I was a little disoriented by Love,Angel Music Baby.  I liked parts of it, but The Sweet Escape is fantastic.  I love Gwen's brutal honesty and the fact that she used the Sound of Music, too.  I hope that Julie Andrews gets a kick out it.  My favorite ND album was Return of Saturn so this was the sort of sound I expected from Gwen.  I love her lyrics and sense of humor.
B00005ATQD|4.0|Was it worth the attention? Definitely. Was it worth the money? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? Certainly. Was it worth two years? Probably. Was it worth the wait? Not really. Does it deserve to be the last effort of the great late director? Unquestionably. <br /> <br />As the plot of Eyes Wide Shut unfolds, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman struggle to attract the audience's attention. They attentively invite the viewer into their fantasy world, in which dreams might be reality and the reality of one single night becomes a long unforgettable dream. <br /> <br />As good of an actor as Tom Cruise is in this movie, Nicole Kidman manages to steal the show from him. The scene during which she reveals to her husband how she would have easily given up everything: him, her daughter, and her life for a naval officer is a powerful combo of her performances in the critically acclaimed To Die For and the Broadway play Blue Room. The only flawed scene for Kidman as Alice, an ex-gallery manager, who is currently unemployed, is the sequence where she tells her husband she had a terrible nightmare. Her sobs are unemotional in that scene and it does not come out as strong as the rest of her performance. <br /> <br />The famously feared orgy scene is indeed peculiar. It captures the viewer attention, but is it really needed? That scene serves little purpose in conveying the true message of the thin line between imaginary and real life. The entire scenery inside the rich mansion, where the orgy scenes take place, where the masked men pray on hookers, is fantastic regardless of the controversy of its necessity. <br /> <br />Stanley Kubrick, a master of filmmaking, gives an imaginary twist to marriage, dreams, and reality of life. But once the viewer exits the theater, he or she is at loss of words and the thin line between the dream world and the reality disappears. Such effect is indeed Kubrick's last legacy. <br /> <br />
B000GRUS22|1.0|A disappointing CD for an Enigma fan since the start.  I miss the sensual sound that I've come to expect from Enigma...bring back the good stuff!
B00005JPC7|4.0|Stranger than Fiction is a poignant piece on shared responsibility and accountability, and the tragicomic circumstances of our lives. It is a look at one's man's hollow life coming to fruition with a love of a woman. <br /> <br />For those going to see this movie for Will Farrell's typical comedy antics - don't go, as you are bound to be highly disappointed. For the first time, Farrell portrays his character (Harold Crick, the IRS auditor lacking a personal life) without tricks or antics. Farrell succeeds beautifully - his character comes off as kind and lovable, a man trapped in the undeniably typical boredom of our lives. Crick's shortcomings are all of our shortcomings, his heroism stemming from the narrator's guiding hand, rather than from his human nature. <br /> <br />Emma Thompson is exceptional as Kay Eiffel, the elusive writer, of eight tragedies, suffering from writer's block and experiencing all the possible ways she can kill her main character. Also notable is Queen Latifah's performance as the assistant, nee publisher's spy. <br /> <br />If the movie feels like it's trying to be excessively moral or philosophic at times, that's because it is. But like a novel that falls short in a few places, but is amazing overall, this movie manages to pick up pace and remind you of its good parts, before you get dragged down by its negatives. <br /> <br />The ending is satisfyingly American, but in a unique way - it doesn't just make the movie more pleasant, it makes sense. Stranger than Fiction often feels like it could've have been written by Charlie Kaufman, except that it's easier to follow and without any craziness and abruptness.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|WOW is this something!!!  He is a mix of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton. <br />This is a must for blues fans.  He is a master of the guitar.   He is only 25 and I think he is the next SRV.  OK I love SRV!  But this is good. <br />Technically he is excellent and he has that feel that doesnt come around that often with blues. He is definitely going places. Get this DVD if you love blues.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine has a sunny heart. The movie is heartwarming, without being sugarcoated; it's sweet without being saccharine. <br /> <br />Exiting the movie theater, I overheard a woman say that Little Miss Sunshine was real. I agree. The movie might not have the most common plot or the most ordinary characters, but its dysfunctional family and a sense of failure resonate with all of us. This movie does not follow a formula and it doesn't try to impress you with any of the traditional Hollywood gimmicks; instead it tells a story the way it's meant to be told - unbegrudgingly and unhinderingly. Its allure is that it's fresh, funny, and innocent, even when profanities are being uttered left and right. <br /> <br />What is most redeeming about this movie, however, are the characters and the superb cast of actors who play them. If one look at the cast reveals a cast full of B movie stars that have never made it big, then these talented people are extremely misjudged and underpaid. Steve Carrell, who arguably is no longer a B movie star after the 40-year-old Virgin crossed the $100 million at the box-office, is incredibly convincing as Frank, the uncle who attempted to commit suicide because of an unrequited homosexual love. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, In Her Shoes) delivers Sheryl, a mother trying to keep her family together, who is at her wits' ends about the life;s failures, so distinctively that it's a wonder if Collette is actually acting or portraying her own experience. Alan Arkin (Jacob the Liar, Gattaca)'s Grandpa is one of the best forefathers on screen. Seeing Paul Dano (The Girl Next Door, Taking Lives) as Dwayne one is amazed and belittled by Dano's tremedous talent. Dano, who spends most of the movie mimicking and writing his lines on a notepad, is an exceptionally talented young man and a promising actor. Furthermore, Greg Kinnear (As Good As it Gets, You've Got Mail) has one of the best performances of his life as Richard, the father who inventeda 9 Step Program to winning, but can't seem to win in life himself. <br /> <br />Yet, what this movie needed was a strong heroine, a girl who isn't waif thin; a girl who has the charm and charisma to steal the show and delight us and it could have no one better than Abigail Breslin (The Signs, Raising Helen), who plays Olive, the little girl who is eligible to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, a California beauty pageant for 6- to 7-year-old girls. Breslin is a girl with a very, very bright future. She isn't a supermodel, but she is better - more human and more real. <br /> <br />The last ten minutes of this movie will delight, surprise, and entertain you. The rest of the moviegoers in my theater laughed until their hands could clap no longer and their faces were full of glee after the movie ended. The movie brought a childhood smile, one of true wonderment and enjoyment to everyone's face. <br /> <br />If you can make people laugh that hard about everybody's worse fear, you don't only have a comedy, you've got a true classic. <br /> <br />Little Miss Sunshine is a winner, but not because it tries and never gives up. It's a winner in the truest sense of the word - it warms your heart and entertains you until the very last credit rolls.
0757302661|5.0|I'm on my fourth child (out of three pregnancies) and wish I had this book/resource before.  I'm also a registered nurse and find the information VERY useful.  I'm excited to use this method during this delivery (I'm having a homebirth this time around) and taking the classes with our local Hypnobirthing Instructor (who will attend my delivery as well).  I enjoy the fact that Ms. Mongan states out loud that this does not take the place of proper prenatal care through a CNM/OB-GYN nor is it for everyone, rather that it is a supplement to a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy. <br /> <br />I'm actually thinking of becoming a Hypnobirthing Instructor myself (as well as changing my career path as a nurse into nurse midwifery).  I believe this book and it's corresponding classes can really help women have a more comfortable and easier experience than traditional \\"medical\\" births. <br />
B000G759LW|4.0|This is really a great CD from Christina.  Disc 2 is my favorite, but both are really good.  I like how disc 1 has a completely different feel from disc 2.  Not Boring!  Glad I bought it!
0684171600|5.0|Perfect condition; great price. Better than I had expected. The order was shipped quickly, no hassle. I bought another one just after I had received the first!
B000002JSN|3.0|I realize this review won't be popular, and I'm in the minority, but Physical Grafitti is probably the most overrated album in the entire Zep catalogue. Custard Pie, the opener, reveals the damage done to Robert Plant's voice after years of heavy touring - it's shredded, a pale shadow of what it once was. Plant redeems himself later, in Houses of the Holy, which conjures up memories of earlier, more glorious days. On the track In My Time of Dying, John Bonham abandons all pretense of subtlety and proceeds to attack his drum kit with a sledgehammer. There are moments of galloping inspiration, of course, but by and large the lack of nuance is detrimental. <br /> <br />The production is murky, presumably intentionally, and a world apart from the clarity of earlier efforts. I didn't care for it all that much back in '75, and I still don't see what all the fuss is about. <br /> <br />Props to the band for the variety of styles on these two discs, but apart from Houses of the Holy and Kashmir, there's really nothing here that stands comfortably beside the monolithic tracks from earlier albums. That same variety, however, works against the album: In My Time of Dying has a bluesy feel that gets abandoned mid-way, only to resurface again near the end. Why stray so far? The track's over 11 minutes long and could have been distilled to 5. That's not to say Physical Grafitti is all bad: Jimmy Page does his usual guitar wizardry, although a dearth of really memorable licks hurts the proceedings, and John Paul Jones is his usual steady self. <br /> <br />If you're new to Zep (is there such a person?) get Zeppelin II or their fourth album. This one is for diehards only.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Purchased 2 CD's without knowing - but the price was great and never really loved the Beatles - but I am glad I bought the disc and gave one as a present.
B0000457HB|5.0|I gave this CD as a Christmas gift to a very good friend who did not have any other Barry White records, although he really likes this artist.  He was thrilled to find all his favorites on this disc and is enjoying listening to it.  So it fulfilled my expectations and his.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Even after 16 years it is still my favorite movie/mini series.  During the first hour it was very interesting learning about the different characters.  Then, as it progresses, you find how they all intertwine. At the end of the first segment (where the snakes are in the river), because of the compassion of the main characters, you begin to slowly relate to their feelings and fall in love with Gus. <br /> <br />The series will be talked about for years with reference to how many of the characters names started with a \\"D\\". How it came to life how Indians scalped people, and how it brought new meaning to the word \\"poke\\". <br /> <br />Lonesome Dove is a series that has everything in a detailed, but easily understood concept.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I had read a mixed review in my local newspaper but was still determined to purchase this CD.  I love all things Beatle so a new CD is a must have.  I haven't seen the show...yet, but hope to this year.  This CD makes me want to see it more.  I knew George Martin and his son had produced the CD so I felt they would handle the task beautifully and they did.  I have all the playlists of The Beatles CD's that I own memorized so it was fun popping this in my CD player and hearing what was coming next and trying to pick out pieces of songs that were mixed in with each other.  The score written for George Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is beautiful.  I have thouroughly enjoyed this CD since I received it at Christmas and highly recommend it, especially to Beatle fans who want something new and different.
0805017445|5.0|The classic story..the perfect gift for my exceptional grandson who at 20 months knows all the animals and the colors in the book.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|My husband and I love this book and the movie; A must for anyone into the samurai culture
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Although the premise for this release had everyone excited , But once i recievd my dvd i was shocked to see that most of the footage that has been around for years really gained nothing from any type of remastering if any ...the reason i bring this up is because most of these shows have been around for years in a much better quality in both picture and sound , dont get me wrong the complete pack is awesome ...but just a little more care could have been taken when collecting the Video source... please other KISS fans tell me what u think am i wrong in thinking this????  still buy this DVD ....
1400049628|5.0|My husband has always been afraid of Zombies... this guide is perfect. The author though.. I think he's serious about what he writes;
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I like this soundtrack alot.  Some of the songs you barely hear in the movie, but nice on the CD.  I have listened to it many times, and don't tire of it.
B000008ERZ|4.0|I only knew the song, \\"Sleeping My Day Away\\" before purchasing the cd. The rest of the cd is almost as good as this track.
B000H5U65C|5.0|I never listened to Mastodon before buying this album and i can say i was pleasantly surprised at the ingenuity and quality of the music of a band from Georgia, close to where I live. It takes some thought and some repeated listening but it pays off in a great listening experience. Oh and the DVD extras were a very appreciated unexpected bonus.
0743454537|5.0|I just wrote a negative review for The Tenth Circle and I thought I should even things out by mentioning what a fantastic book I think this is.  The ending blew me away, I was totally unprepared which, in my opinion, made this book one of the best I've read in a long time.
B000JJRIO8|5.0|Another great album from 2Pac.  Everything this man creates is Hot!!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I bought the first version of the DVD by Criterion about 10 years ago and I wasn't sure about re-buying it a second time cause I always think that if I rebuy a movie the distributor must be laughing at me. But...i really really don't regret it, a classic like this should be seen with this version. I don't like buying twice but this is simply incredible. This version is STUNNING visually, way better than the first one. I owned about 300 DVDs and this is one of my best black and white. I simply rediscover the film it was so great looking, I saw details I didn't see before because of the sharpness of the picture. The sound is also better, no more hissing and cracking like an old record and they give a surround soundtrack too. The extras are great too meaning another audio commentary by 5 experts (very entertaining), a 2 hour interview with Kurosawa discussing many fascinating subjects, a 50 minute documentary on the making and a documentary about the meaning of samurais. Long story short, I started the film in the morning and I finished watching everything in the evening. If you don't know the film rent it first or watch it on TV, but if you know it and want to buy it, go ahead a piece of history is worth 40$ in my mind.
0452285186|5.0|For those with a sense of dark humor this is a laugh out loud happy pill that I take as needed.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Absolutely incredible CD!  It is definitely NOT a let down from his other projects.  He is getting better all the time. Try it....you'll love it! Then if you don't have his other projects, I bet you get them after hearing this one.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Typically I am not a big fan of understated and subtle, but this was both and I loved it. Amanda Root is not you typical \\"movie star\\" but was wonderful. This is one I will watch over and over and find something new every time.
0307237699|5.0|With rumors that he is willing to be considered by his political party for higher office, rock star political figure Senator Barack Obama has written a book that is well worth reading, especially for anyone wanting to delve into the mystery of the real Barack Obama.<br /><br />Senator Obama has enormous appeal and charisma.  Why?  Perhaps it is because, in an age of political polarization and hard partisanship we hunger for a thoughtful, pragmatic political leader who is not necessarily wedded to a particular ideological stance, someone who is almost instinctively a reconciler and a political unifier, someone who will ask the hard questions and give some very thoughtful answers - someone, in short, who can appeal not just to Democrats of all stripes but to Republicans and to Independents.<br /><br />This book will reward the reader who seeks to find out why Senator Obama has such universal appeal to the American people, and why he very well could win the Democratic nomination for President in 2008.
0767020308|3.0|I have seen lots of Emmas and this is my least favorite. If I weren't such a Jane Austen fan, this would have been worse.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This is one of the best music DVD's I have seen.
0736063684|5.0|Excellent book, very clear pictures of muscles and bones and specific exercises to work specific muscle groups which are clearly hightlighted and labeled.  There are explanations of the name of the muscles worked and the exercises.  Very well organized chapters by muscle groups.
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|WE loved this CD. It takes you to all levels of jazz. It is great for all occasions. You will not be disappointed by purchasing this magnificent Cd by two of the masters of music/jazz. The other compulations are excellent also.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|This film got terrible reviews with the idea that it was nothing but a mindless and especially brutal gore fest.  It's true that the movie does have scenes of horrible torture, but it is an essential part of the plot.  After all this is a HORROR movie - if you don't want to be horrified, don't watch it!  The story makes sense, the ending is satisfying, and it will eliminate any thoughts you may have had about visiting Slovakia!
B000J10ER4|5.0|Received DVD on release date...Very Satisfied with price and delivery time...
B000HT3Q3M|1.0|Al & George are two of my Fav's. When I saw the new CD I was thrilled and pre-ordered! Im such an Al Fan I am flying from Cleveland to Califronia in a few weeks to see a show in Southern Cal.  I have seen George B about 4 times. Their song choices for this album could have been much better. Even the choice of instruments and lead are poor.  I could have picked 12 other songs that would have truely maken this a 1+1 =3.  In stead, this has been dimisnished to a 1+1 = 1/2. I listened to this 2 times and threw it in the garbage. Unfortunately, it has a second life. My sister got it for me as a Christmas gift. I had to smile and then throw it out the window of the car on the way home! Stay away.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Meat Loaf's latest album, \\"Bat Out Of Hell III: The Monster is Loose\\" is a very worthy addition to the \\"Bat\\" trilogy.  The title track, while not as long as the original \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" nor as influential, is a great song.<br /><br />While Steinman didn't write all the songs on it as he did on the pervious 2 Bats, the songs he did write are clearly the best on the album.<br /><br />All the songs on it are suburb, and it's a required addition to any Meat Loaf fan.
0316010669|5.0|Although I didn't care for the book itself, it came in a timely fashion
B00003CXBH|4.0|I saw this video years ago but I still remember it as being very exciting and action filled with superb acting.  I think it is one of the best action-adventure film ever made.  And it was shot on location.  The photography was stunning.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is practically the only Christmas album I listened to this season.  At first, I didn't like the version of \\"Jingle Bells\\", but then even it grew on me -- it was the one that was still in my head after I turned the music off.  \\"Some Children See Him,\\" \\"Who Comes This Night\\" and \\"In The Bleak Midwinter\\" are just beautiful.  I've listened to those 3 tracks over and over and over.  I'm still listening to them now almost a month after Chrismas.  They are just that pretty to me.  The duet with Natalie Cole is terrific.  You can just see them there performing it.  In fact, I've love to see a video of the whole Christmas album. <br />
B00003CXB2|2.0|This film is way too long.  It could easily be cut in half.  The extra length makes it quite boring.  The acting in it is excellent but the length of the film is colossal.  I saw it in the theatre when it was revived about 20 years ago.  So I saw it in the best of circumstances not on video on my TV.  But I still found it boring.  One of the most boring films I have ever watched.  Sorry.
B00006LI4S|3.0|I bought this DVD for my husband for his birthday.  He loves Pink Floyd and David Gilmour.  It is a fastastic DVD.  We have watched it many times and enjoy it as much each time.  David Gilmour is an incredible guitarist and this DVD really shows his talent.  A must have for anyone who loves his music.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I saw this video years ago.  But it really impressed me especially Ben Kingsley's acting.  He made a superb Gandhi.  The on location photography was spectacular.  This has to be one of the best films ever made period!
B000641Z90|5.0|Superb audio and Video. Can't get enough of it. Get it...you won't be disappointed.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my dad--something kids and adults alike would enjoy.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|I have always enjoyed Forbidden Planet. It seems a precursor for Star Trek and many other fantastic space oriented adventure series.
B000I5X81A|5.0|It was not what I expected from eric clapton.......I love his sound, but this was not for me........
1401308201|5.0|This book is just amazing!  Glorious color photos and we just love the performer's inside knowledge of the characters and how they adapted the roles.  This book is a must have for the Wicked enthusiast!  Getting it for $3.00 on Amazon was not too shabby either!  Lovely book, if you're thinking about getting it, just do it!
B00000331V|5.0|The quintiscential Geils band live album.  If you grew up in the seventies, this was the party album.  Good sound and great energy.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I just love this movie and only watch it on Christmas eve.  It's a tradition started about 5 years ago.  I look forward to seeing this moving every year.  It doesn't feel like Christmas until I watch this movie!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|The service and the product are more than I could ever have asked for. Wonderful!!!
B00005JO9J|5.0|Rewatching the interns' first day at Seattle Grace was like thinking back to summer visits with my favorite raucously funny aunt. It's familiar and yet so much has happened since then, that you can't help but smile when you think back on it. I fully enjoyed reliving every moment of the show's beginnings.   <br /> I'd say that if you're a die hard fan, you should own this, if you don't already. Trust me, you'll laugh at the same places. The jokes are still funny a second and third time around. <br /> If you're not a die hard fan, but you've heard a lot of buzz about the show and you'd like to get into it, you should get this. There are so many subtle events that have shaped the present situations, that it'll be hard to fully understand the show where it is. You can watch it now and still find enjoyment, but you'll be in the dark for a little while.  <br /> If you're not a fan of the show at all and have no desire to ever watch it, then why are you reading this review? Why are you browsing this item? I think you secretly want it. Well, go for it. It's great. <br /> <br />
0679422714|5.0|This book is a good look at one of the most vile men in the world.  He was the consumate manipulator of other humans.  He probably has done more to hurt China than any of the ancient rulers.  I question if we will ever know the cost in human lives that this man caused.  If you want to understand what happened to China during the latter half of the 20th Century, read this book.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our entire family loves this game. It appeals to every age group: kids, teens, and adults. It only takes a few minutes to learn and once you get the hang of it, it's kind of addicting. A great gift for anyone, young or old, who likes to play games that require some strategy.
0743298020|4.0|If you are a lover of gothic tales, Jane Eyre style, this should be an entertaining read. Diane Setterfield sets a haunted tone in her impressive debut novel. There are many twists and turns throughout and, though the ending wasn't a complete surprise, it was very satisfying. The protagonist, a self proclaimed amateur biographer, finds herself in the employ of a famous reclusive author. Soon after agreeing to pen the author's one `true' biography - listening to her tales of mysterious twins, spectral figures, and suspicious fires - her own family ghosts are disturbed to great affect; many characters remark that she looks like she's 'seen a ghost'. There is a literary feel to this novel (Jane Eyre is invoked several times) that will appeal to classic book lovers. You can almost feel the wind redden your cheeks on the chilly Moors and smell the oak bookshelves in the amber-lit library.<br /><br />4.5 stars
0790729342|4.0|This movie is an all around good time.  The action is fantastic and Mel Gibson is great as usual (despite almost no dialogue).  The photography is beautiful as well, although not as good as 'Mad Max' in my opinion.  The story is probably the weak point in this movie (compared to the original's powerful revenge story), but you don't always need a story when the action's good.  Although there is an interesting twist towards the end that you may not see coming. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the genre, this is one of the better ones and worth seeing (more than once), but check out 'Mad Max' first if you haven't already.  I recommend the entire trilogy.
B000I5X81K|5.0|There's only one word to describe this CD . . . AWESOME.  Josh Groban just gets better and better!!!  The songs are truly a work of art and he sings them like an angel.  I didn't think it could be possible, but it's even better than this last CD.  He's truly a talented individual with a beautiful voice.  You'll love each and every song on AWAKE.
B000H5U832|5.0|Bought cars for my grandchildren, but the adults enjoy it also. It brings back memories of Route 66.  It is a movie that you can watch over and over again.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Funny, well written.  Good acting.  Great visual effects with tinting the film and what not. Cinematography solid and beautiful. The music was wonderful - I downloaded the soundtrack to my iPod and listen to it regularly.<br /><br />Lines from this movie are regularly quoted by myself and my friends.
6305882592|5.0|This movie is a funky must-see cult-classic of the 70s with an excellent soundtrack by Cat Stevens.  It was rumored to be Ruth Gordon's favorite movie that she was in.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You have to pay attention, but don't need to be Monk to keep up.  LOVE the editing style.<br /><br />A 'must see' for anyone who considers themselves a film buff.
B000FL7CAK|2.0|I adore this show and I was really looking forward to the DVD set.  I buy many tv shows on DVD because I love the backstory.  I want to hear why the producers and writers made the choices they did, I want to hear about the arcs and all the background on making a tv program.  The extra with Kristen Bell was great but there were no commentaries.  I am still a big fan of the show but there wasn't enough extra on the DVD set to warrant the price.  I can record the show on TV and have pretty much the same thing.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|Of course it's not as good as the first but once you get past the expectations of it trying to be, it's a pretty good mix of music.  I'm enjoying it a lot.  If you're a Meatloaf fan, you have to buy it.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I put this in the CD player and I haven't taken it out.  It is great.  Each song is perfect.  If you are a Beatles fan, get it.
B000H5U832|4.0|My 2 and 7 year olds LOVE this movie.  I didn't think it was quite as funny as previous Pixar movies but the message was really good.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I would have no beef with this release, even the fact that Lucas is asking us to double dip less than a year after the original trilogy was released to DVD the first time, if only, ONLY, they were presented with anamorphic widescreen. Is that too much to ask? Billion dollar LucasArts and Industrial Lights & Magic can't put be bothered to release product that is up to current standards? Once again, old man Lucas slaps his fan base in the face.  <br /> <br />Quite frankly, with the release of the God-awful prequels, the ridiculously idiotic \\"Special Editions\\" (with the \\"Fraggle Rock\\"- style Jabba's Palace musical number) of the original trilogy, and countless other insults to my intelligence, anything I ever loved about Star Wars has been soiled.  <br /> <br />I like to watch movies, I enjoy the cinematic art, but all this baggage required to enjoy Star Wars these days is too much effort for too little reward. It feels more like I'm watching a video game than a film. Let the mindless geeks that bow to Lucas' every whim open their wallets and throw their hard earned geek money down. But I doubt the general population are going to care much longer. Their numbers have to be dwindling, and eventually their numbers will be so low that perhaps Lucas will see the error of his ways and treat the original films with some shred of respect. You can't go back, George. It was 1977. What's done is done. Be proud of your accomplishments. They were 3 good films. They stood the test of time.  <br /> <br />But now they are gone. You can have `em, for a couple of months, but you can't watch them with your HD televisions. You want 1977, then you watch it with 1977 equipment, right George? What a sick maniac he is. Evil is the only word that sums him up. <br /> <br />All Lucas' tinkering has made a mess of things. Hey, I'm all for cleaning up the picture and maybe making certain special effects look a little nicer (Landspeeder pink glow? Transparent Snow Speeders? I got no problem with him touching those up). But I find alterations that greatly change the flow of the film (or, in the case of the CGI Jabba in A New Hope and the ghastly new Jabba Palace song, brings the films to a screeching halt). It's impossible to watch the films without being annoyed. Heck, I can't even enjoy the sinister \\"Darth Vader\\" since I know there's a sniveling little twerp inside the costume.  <br /> <br />Yep, the world of Star Wars is forever ruined, and I couldn't care less if I ever see any of the films again as long as I live. I felt tempted to buy this set just out of desperation, but I have to take a stand. We are the enablers who give him the money and power to do these things. We are the ones who can send a message, even if that message will be misinterpreted or fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br />If you need me, I'll be watching Wrath of Khan. At least I know I'll be seeing the real film, not some mess made by the constant tinkering of a stumbling, demented old fool. Kirk shoots the Ceti eel first!
B00008J2PG|5.0|An excellent true story of a brave man who was honored by six countries for his efforts in helping people during World WarII.  This is a great family film for all ages, men and women, though young children probably could not follow the story line without help.  It has intrigue, suspense, danger,...   My family would give it 7 stars or more!
B0000508U6|4.0|This Cd I bought for only two of the songs. I do however enjoy more than the two I got it for.Its not as good as X&Y but its good. I have bought most all Cold plays music and this band is awesome.
B000G759LW|4.0|I think that this new album is amazingly creative and new. A step in another direction for Ms. Aguilera that distances herslf from the multitude and reminds us why we liked her in the first place.

1931382794|4.0|this is a great book to understand the details of training for cycling using a powermeter. a necessary reference for the library of an athlete with a powermeter. this is the first of its kind and does a great job directing the reader in methods to analyze power data from rides, get the most of workouts, and monitor training stress. also includes pretty thorough reviews of the various powermeters on the market.
B000A6T294|5.0|Star Treks days of glory have come to an end. STAR TREK - NEMESIS may be the final cinematic chapter the STAR TREK Next Generation crew. Interestingly this is a dark and somewhat bleak looking film involving the Romulans. The film is actually good but the pessimistic atmosphere leaves one yearning for the glory days of STAR TREK be they the old or next generation. Jerry Goldsmith's final Star Trek score is outstanding and one of his best.
B000002U82|3.0|My flatmate had a copy of this album when people were into this type of music. He played it all the time and although I remember that it wasn't too bad, 20 years later not one track remained in my mind. Out of nostalgia I bought the CD recently and ho-hum, why does everyone go overboard in their reviews. It's soft, probably quite cutting for its time, but not for today. In fact it can get a little boring in the sameness of the tracks. It'll get a listen every so often, but to call it the world's best is a long way from the mark, even if you are a devotee of this music.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Me and my Husband love this Show! After watching the first Season, well, the first show of the first season we got hooked and watched it ever since! You need to watch it from the beginning to understand the whole story, but its well worth it!!!
B000HBKCDC|4.0|Sarah has one of the most insightful and beautiful voices, making her selections quite apporpriate for her very distinct voice.  For someone who is in the not-so-jolly-holly Chrsitmas mood, who is looking for songs that convey some understanding of their multi-dimenstional feelings, the CD is perfect.  Sarah's \\"Wintersong\\" will be a classic in years to come.

B000EHQ8AU|5.0|This is also a good album from Placebo, although not my favorite.  The bonus DVD is awesome, it has a lot of their videos from MTV and great live performances.  Definitely a must have if you love Placebo!

0307237699|5.0|I picked up this book ready to disagree with Barak on many subjects, but when I was done I found myself in the beginnings of many agreements.  We have needed a unifying leader like Barak in this country since the Regan days.  He has reminded me what it means to be an American, and made me proud to be one again.  Even if you disagree with the man, you realize that there is very little Red or Blue in this country and we are all different shades of Purple. <br />When willing to deal with issues honestly and selflessly whilst trying to do the best for \\"US\\", we need someone like Barak more than ever today.
B00005221M|5.0|A very good movie. The directors cut has some nice extra features that are a must for the Last of the Mohicans fans. Highly recommended
B000AYEL1A|4.0|The movie has emotional excitement,good acting,and follows through to the end.  The music is a little off-beat for the audiences played to;but it is good.
B000ION23A|3.0|I thought this move would be great and it was, when i watched it the first time, but it lost its touch when I saw it a second time. I would not recommend this to another person because of the lack of entertainment. It has no way to keep the viewer's attention on the movie at times and to make it simple, its just plain boring.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is just a really great show! It will definitely keep you hanging and wanting to watch more and more of it! I can't wait for Season 3 to come out!
B000B7HZXM|5.0|I ordered this thru Amazon and received it right away. I have really enjoyed the album.  <br /> <br />always do business with Amazon
B000000WZ4|4.0|I love this CD.  I listen to it a lot, even 10-12 years later.  The sounds and melodies are very simple, but melodic.  Most importantly, they groove.  The whole groove of this cd makes you relax and almost melt into a euphoric & heavily relaxed state of conscious without losing its cool.  Another interesting fact about this album is that they hire Living Colour/Tackhead bassist, Doug Wimbish to lay down the bass lines.  He adds a groove and ambient element to this cd that has never been captured by any other Depeche Mode cd...before or after.  I wish they would hire him again for their next cd.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This is a superb DVD.  Just like being there in person!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is awesome! It's got some of the great 3D graphics ever (as usual with Square), the plot is great and very entertaining. Highly recommended, specially for the Final Fantasy fans (superspecially FFVII fans).
B000683VI4|5.0|What a wonderful love story.  We should all be lucky enough to find true love and have it last forever.  Everyone in this film did an outstanding job and I have watched it over and over again.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|My first set of DVDs was defective.  So, I sent them back.  The second set was defective as well!  This is not the fault of Amazon but rather of HBO home videos!  And, they wonder why people like to buy bootleg copies...!  My friend bought bootleg copies in China that work just fine.  I try and buy the full-price collector's set, and almost none of them played!!!
B000FFJYB6|5.0|Me & my children really enjoyed this movie, it's funny, warm, sad & a really good family movie. Both my boys, are ages 9 & 10 now, but they watched it the first time when they were 5 & 6.... they cried because it really tugs at your heart. If you are a pet lover, you will really appreciate the great writers who must have had a big heart for animals & probably wrote it based on personal experiences.
0618680004|5.0|<br />If you approach this book with an open mind you will find the arguments for atheism well presented and convincing. Atheists will find an organized presentation for many of the beliefs they already hold. <br /> <br />Believers may not drop their religion, but they might become better able to understand how atheists arrive at their beliefs, and learn that most are good people and not to be feared.
0060760273|4.0|We received this book/plush bunny set as a gift.  We love the Goodnight Moon story, and read it almost every night.  Our 8 month old daughter, while she thinks the board book is delicious, has adopted the 5\\" Bunny as her very favorite Lovey, and won't go to sleep without him.  He is just the right size for an infant.  He has a grey faux-fur head and \\"hands\\", and wears blue-striped pajamas with textured feet.  His eyes are the bead-type, rather than embroidered, but they are very well attached.  The ears are long enough to get into her mouth for serious sucking, and the arms are well-stuffed, making for good gnawing.  His body is stuffed with the microbeads, and my only complaint (thus 4 stars, not 5) is that he is labelled \\"surface wash only\\".  I have, due to the daily baby-spit, given him many baths, and he seems to dry out just fine.
B00008DDXL|5.0|From the first Harry Potter movie I became hooked. I have read all of J.K. Rowlings books (Harry Potter) and seen all of the movies. The Cinematography is excellent and the movies follow the story line of the books. Excellent screen writing.
1401302378|4.0|The explication of the reach of the new niche markets is brilliant. No longer does the retail economy depend on \\"the next big thing\\", the real blockbuster, but Chris Anderson has correctly identified the splintering of the economy and the resulting plethora of opportunity.     Add the Internet to the bricks and mortar and you can really see this proliferation of \\"less of more.\\" A new book \\"Internet Riches\\" by Scott Fox extends this thesis. This book is packed with real life examples of web success stories and strategies, some amazingly off-the-wall that would never have succeeded (or existed) in the old economy. The new economics of distribution delivered via the Internet has brought commercial viability to unique ideas and small niche markets all because of the 40 million people out there \\"browsing\\".    The book correctly points out the changing face of the retail business in this country, beyond the media. In a sense it also goes the opposite direction also. Because of the proliferation of products and the world wide distribution system brought about by e-commerce you can find goods that used to be one-of-a-kind have been copied by the large retailers and what used to be unique is unique throughout all the Pottery Barn, West Elm and Crate and Barrel homes around the world. The long tail of innovative goods gets quickly snapped up and replicated for all to own.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Is the best product out there today with lethal weapon i love the movie and mel gibson too.
B00000K413|5.0|I have till late been only a casual listener of TFF, and in fact was considerably disappointed with their later \\"Seeds of love\\" album. Nevertheless, I took a chance on a triple set of what seemed to be at least two very good albums (Hurting / Big Chair). Having listened to all three now, I have to say that \\"The Hurting\\" is TFF's masterpiece. The album is more melodious than its successors (bar perhaps the slightly raucous \\"The Prisoner\\"), and the vocal delivery and guitar/synth arrangements are much more effective. \\"Big chair\\" just has two great tracks, but this one is consistently good from beginning to end. If you own just one TFF record, this should be it. \\"Mad world\\" and \\"Pale shelter\\" alone are worth the price of the CD
B000053GTF|5.0|Celine dion has a wonderful voice that's why i love her so much.
B000002I7R|4.0|Pictures at eleven is the closest Plant's solo career would get to the Zeppelin sound. He was searching for his a new sound and didn't veer to far, he did later with synths and I wasn't all that thrilled. Most of the songs are well written and played tight. He enlisted Robbie Blunt, Paul Martinez, Jez Woodruffe and Phil Collins and Barrimore Barlow on drums. Highlights include Burning down one side(the MTV video for this song was simply amazing!), slow dancer, moonlight in samoza and the infectious pledge pin(with sax solo,sorta odd, I'd like to hear a Blunt guitar solo instead!)but overall a solid yet experimental immediate post Zep solo album. I really like this record and still play it regularly! The production values stillsound as crisp and clear now as it did in the early 1980s. It holds up well and is still my fav Plant solo record, without a doubt. Give it a listen for yourself, you'll agree!

B000HT3Q3M|5.0|This collaboration between George Benson and Al Jarreau is such a clever idea. Two multi-talented jazz icons in one album is simply a treat to my ears. For fans of Benson and Jarreau, this is definitely a \\"must-add\\" to your collection.<br /><br />I missed their much-anticipated concert last summer at the Hollywood Bowl since I wasn't able to be back on time from my summer get-away at Prince Edward Island. My co-workers and I have bought our tickets way ahead of time and have been eagerly waiting for that special show. I've wanted to watch these two favorite artists of mine and I was so disappointed, it would have been like \\"killing two birds with one stone.\\" So I just gave away my ticket to a co-worker who totally enjoyed the concert. Her gain, my loss! Well, I'm hoping that there will be another joint-concert coming soon and I'll make sure not to miss it.<br /><br />My favorites from this collection are of course their respective all-time hits, \\"Breezin'\\" and \\"Mornin'.\\" Who would have thought that words have been added to Bobby Womack's stunning and tuneful music? Thanks to Al Jarreau's creative musical mind that we can now enjoy \\"Breezin'\\" in two different ways, with or without lyrics. Ditto with \\"Mornin'\\" - we'll be delighted with two versions now, an instrumental version or the original. Likewise, this awesome pair gives Seals & Crofts' \\"Summer Breeze\\" and Hall & Oates' \\"Every Time You Go Away\\" fresh styles and great interpretations with splendid arrangements by Larry Williams.<br /><br />Also featured in this album are their special guest musicians who all excel in their respective craft namely: Herbie Hancock (piano), Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller (bass), Marion Meadows (sax), Chris Botti (trumpet), Patti Austin and Jill Scott (vocals on \\"Let It Rain\\" and \\"God Bless The Child,\\" respectively) and Beatles superstar, Paul McCartney (vocals on \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\").<br /><br />It's very rare that two jazz greats are in one album, but George Benson and Al Jarreau made it happen! I just hope that this wouldn't be the last and that there will be another collaboration in the future.<br /><br />Wholeheartedly recommended.on and Al Jarreau made it happen!

0307341542|5.0|WOW... I first read an excerpt of this book in my REDBOOK magazine, and thought it might be an interesting mystery, a light way to relax after the kids go to bed.  But by the second chapter, I was completely sucked in, and read the whole thing in less than 24 hours!  This novel contains some of the best visualization I have experienced in my casual reading thus far.  I couldn't believe how much the author made me relate with characters in which I have nothing in common, but somehow I could feel everthing... And for me, that makes a GREAT novel.  I can slightly agree with some of the other reviewers about the sexual parts lacking a little, but hey, if you want trash, read Penthouse Forum instead!  The sexual scenes \\"fell flat\\", to use another reviewers words, only because they weren't the main focus of the story.  It seems to me that the encounters weren't made that important in the book because they weren't that important to our main character, Camille.  But I suppose you'll have to read and decide for yourself.  All in all, this book comes highly recommended by me.... I finished the novel about 4 pm, and have already handed it off to a friend, urging her to read it as soon as possible (so I can get it back and read it again!)
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Awesome new artist!  Love her voice and style.  I've got it - some are getting the Norah Jones comparison, but something else they can't put their finger on.  She is a cross between Maria Muldaur (from back in the 70's - anyone remember her?) and Norah Jones.  Love both of them and love Corinne Bailey Rae!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love this cd.  Sarah's reditions of some of the older Christmas songs are fantastic!  And her own songs are amazing as well.  I listened to her cd everyday during the holidays.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is Tim Burton's best movie. And possibly Johnny Depp's too. It certainly was Martin Landau's finest moment. It's a small canvas but all the stars really shone here, except for Sarah Jessica Parker, who was always a mediocre actress to me. Bill Murray was at the peak of his sardonic best, pre-Lost In Translation. Johnny Depp gave a performance that was at once funny and sad. It's a multi-dimensional movie that one suspects started off only as a comedic biography but ended up as one of the best movies of the 90s. A highly entertaining mix of movie-making maverick and top-notch acting. Even in black and white, the movie resonated with a richness in texture and realism. A throwback to the B&W flicks of an era long gone. A superb homage. A fascinating character study. Made me laugh. Made me cry. Unmissable.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|Almost all the DVDs were scratched pretty badly. I sent the set back explaining the problem and asking them to inspect the DVDs before they send me a replacement. Well, they didn't becuase the replacement I received was just as bad -all scratched.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Brilliant. This was Redford and Newman at the height of their respective stardom, their swaggering best. A western that's essentially a heist movie and a chase movie all rolled into one gripping, funny, well-told and superbly acted classic. A masterpiece. The likes of which will probably never be made again. 5 stars!

B000H7JD4K|5.0|After Brave New World, I actually felt a little let down by the Dance of Death album, but I didnt think twice before picking up this CD, hoping that it would be as great as Brave New World.  <br />I was not disappointed, this album is full of classics. Each time I give it a spin I find something new and beautiful in each song. While \\"Different World\\" is immediately catchy, \\"The Pilgrim\\" & \\"Brighter than a thousand suns\\" stand out as classics.  <br />Go ahead, buy it and be amazed every time you listen to this one!

B0001YRVN4|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy Full Screen Edition on DVD is even better than the Wide Screen version.  I have the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition also at home on VHS -- I would like Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment to release a new DVD version of the Original Star Wars trilogy with video footage from the Special Edition VHS tapes with George Lucas talking about how they improved the Star Wars movies from the Original Trilogy release to the Special Edition release. This is not on DVD. The Star Wars Trilogy Limited Edition has an audio dialogue with Lucas and the stars of the movie among other crew members that plays with the movie. However, there is no video footage in the release.  <br /> <br />I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE the Star Wars movies on Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes Store. Apple which recently changed its name to Apple Inc., the maker of Macintosh computer operating systems, iPods and now Apple TV -- formerly the iTV device runs a great music and video download store. <br /> <br />Packaged media formats like VHS, DVD and upcoming BluRay Disc and HD DVDs with higher capacity storage for recording and playback of better quality high definition video (hi-def video) are great and all but the future also holds video on demand services and iTunes is the leader. <br /> <br />I would love to play the Star Wars movies on my iPod or TV using Apple TV. Sure I can use view it on TV with my DVD Player or VCR but using Apple TV is great also.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|Jane Austen's book is so amazing that it can be made into a movie over and over and still not be boring.  I have watched this particular version many times and I love it!  This is one movie that will not sit on the shelf.  This is a classic romance story which is exquisitely acted by the entire cast.  If you love English period movies, then this is perfect for you.
0307237699|5.0|Being about the same age as Barack Obama, I have longed for a perspective that gets beyond the not only the regressive conservatism of the past 30 years but also the predominant liberalism that seems locked in a 60s mindset.  Barack reveals an honest, truly progressive, open-minded approach to politics (and life in general) that is refreshing and full of potential.  <br />     I used to think it wasn't that important who the president was, but the past six years has proved that it is important to have someone at the helm who has the ability to see clearly and with enough capacity in mind and in soul to steer our unwieldy and incredibly powerful ship of state. Obama seems to have a greater capacity in this regard than any president in memory. Is he ready to move into the White House? I cannot yet say, but I am very curious.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This true and incredible story is well told and represents in depth the sadness and horror lived by this poor ''elephant man''. Because this movie is in black and white, it gives you the full latitude of living profoundly the feelings and subtilities played by all those great actors. You'll be transported from the very first scene in a world filled with hatrid and hope, despair and love, injustice and salvation. This movie will make you look at yourself and at others in a totally new way. An experience of a lifetime based on the reality of one kind and intellectual but plagued human being. A must for all that need to take a look at beauty from the inside.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I saw John Mayer in concert recently and he sounds even better live than in a recording.  Having said that, Continuum is an outstanding CD.  Mayer's lyrics can be intense, playful, wistful, sensual, and sometimes all of the above.  He has a very strong, sexy and expressive voice.  I find his songs to be diverse and very tightly performed.  What else can I say?  Room for Squares was a cute pop intro for him but the cute is gone.  Now he's back and he sounds more mature, experienced and talented.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Both picture and sound quality are petty good, though not outstanding. We have enjoyed Joss Wheedon's work as a television director and writer for some years now (Buffy, Angel and Firefly on TV). He likes to poke fun at many things in an intelligent way and this movie is no exception.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|yes there is explicit sex and nudity but don't let that either put you off or be your reason for watching this film. <br /> <br />The fact that the sex is explicit and unashamed normalises it and allows sexual conductn to be viewed in its context on the same basis as other conduct. <br /> <br />I can't wait to see it on DVD.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|On the whole, I think Gore did an excellent job of laying out the facts without heavy editorializing. This film was clean, well-edited and well-written. The clear presentation of the facts presents an overwhelming case for a dangerous increase in global warming, and when I hear people claim that the global warming issue is just a political move by the left, I have to wonder where they're getting their information, since they clearly aren't looking at the facts. My only gripe, which prevented me from giving it a five-star rating, is that Gore just couldn't stop sticking in clips about his lost election to Bush in 2000. The early clip about Bush was well-placed and funny, but Gore just couldn't seem to let it go and had to keep coming back to it. The later references had a bit of a sour-grapes feel to them, and  I suspect that without these clips the film could have reached even more people. I feel that because of these sidebars into politics, Mr. Gore just gave ammunition to the Right to turn this into a political issue, and I believe that while he had good intentions, these additions may have been a distraction from the core message. I have noticed from talking to many friends that they felt the same way, including many who were sympathetic to Mr. Gore but annoyed by the fact that the 2000 campaign clips and comments seemed very out of context after a certain point. In spite of this problem, however, I highly recommend that everyone see this film and take action on the powerful and alarming message it contains. This isn't a political issue, and it's my hope that anyone clinging to the notion that it is will look past any political content and grasp the facts of the matter (and then act on them).
0060229357|5.0|I was going through old books and discovered an old beat up paperback \\"Harold\\" book.  It made me smile, and I remembered how I loved it as a kid.  I bought it in hardback so I could treasure it forever!  Now I read it to my kids--yet another generation now enjoys this tale.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I got this cd for christmas, and popped it in. The first listen through it was pleasant enough...and then i just had the urge to just keep it playing over and over and over. I put it on my ipod, and his album goes with me everywhere. I find in listening to his other cds along with this, that it is a departure for him. It displays a lighter touch with the instruments than his other two do. His voice is clearer, and he displays a wider range in his singing. There is not a song that would skip over, though I am particularly in love with the songs, \\"In Her Eyes\\" and \\"Now or Never\\". I usually find that I like his songs sung in other languages better, such as \\"Si Volvieras a Mi\\" or \\"All Improviso Amore\\", from Closer, but the opposite is true. The non-English music is much like a security blanket on this album, and I do not mean that in a derogatory way at all. I am a fan of acapella, so the fact that he sounds fantastic with little backup is great. I particularly think that his collaborations are great, especially \\"Lullaby\\" with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. For those who want a remake of his last albums, you will be disappointed. But if you would like to hear a phenomenal album from a phenomenal vocalist, this is the album for you.
080726203X|4.0|This is a great book.  The story centers on Jonas, a young boy with a special gift who lives in a world that has been stripped of emotion and how lives are altered and eyes are opened when emotions are introduced. A definite classic and a must read.
B0001I561E|4.0|It seems there were some Disney golden days in the 90s, and this is one of the best examples of those great movies. Fun, colorful, and with great music, Aladdin never gets boring or heavy-handedly teaches you some IMPORTANT LESSON. One complaint I have is that the one female character doesn't get to do much.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkins has created an outstanding work that explains the irrationality of religion and belief in god.  He builds an extremely strong case for atheism and exposes the harm that religion does to society.  I absolutely loved this book!  If you're an atheist this book will provide structure and an organized framework for the individual arguments (that you've probably known all along) against god's existence.  It will further open your mind with some new ideas and new ways of looking at the world.   <br /> <br />If you're the religious type, the book will explain the atheist's point of view, will offer new ideas to open and expand your mind, and will perhaps make you a more tolerant and understanding person.  Dawkins hope is that this book will open your eyes to the irrationality, superstition, fear, and control of religion by applying logic and reason--the two tools that have succeeded in explaining the world around us in a way that religion could never match. Question everything.   <br />
B0002B15WE|5.0|If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD to add to your collection, Die Hard is a great choice. It's very re-watchable - I just watched it 3 times in the past few weeks, and it's fun to watch during the winter due to its holiday backdrop. Bruce Willis was at his action character best in this first edition of the Die Hard trilogy.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|A great CD. I gave as Christmas present to my grandaughter who is a junior in college.  The Beatles are still popular found among all ages of people,  and their music is timeless.
B000I0QK74|5.0|The songs in this CD are exceptional, wonderful, stupendous; everything we expected from James Taylor.  The CD, on the other hand, arrived with a scratch across four songs.  Imagine our dismay when, upon replacement from another vendor, the exact same scratch came with the newest version!  Has anyone else experienced something similar?  Where were these CDs manufactured?
B000H7I6CU|5.0|It's a funny movie for all ages, the only thing that I see that is not \\"Original\\" music for the movie. This is a strane thing because all Disney's and Pixar's movies have an original score. <br /> <br />

B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is, by far, the best album Tool has ever come out with. It sounds a lot like Lateralus in some places but once you really start to listen, you cannot ignore the sense of awe that grows within you. The sound is much cleaner and well defined in this album as compared to Lateralus and the meaning is beyond words. To think of Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days is to be touched and amazed. This song is for Maynards mother who had been in a coma for approx 10,000 days before she passed on. They are both beautfully written songs and are hard to stop listening to. The hard hitters have to be Vicarious, The Pot and Rosetta Stoned that are absolutely filled with musical power.<br /><br />All in all, it takes a little listening but this album is addictive. I haven't been able to stop listening to it. And oh! The CD case is GENIUS! You have to buy it to believe it. Trust me on this one!

B000HT3Q3M|4.0|This is a really cool album. Two of the greatest musicians performing together. My expectations were high, and I have to say that they guys almost  made it all the way. They are performing a few of each other's greatest hits and my only reservation is that the recordings are just a tad too close to the original recordings. I was expecting that they would add a little more of their own personality to each other's songs. But hey, this is still good stuff and everyone who is a fan of either Benson or Jarreau (or both) should buy this album. <br />And - having Sir Paul McCartney guest-starring on the album's last track is just sooo great!
0316236551|5.0|My 5 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old sons LOVE these books, I am amazed at what they have learned to draw, and they enjoy creating their own versions of the faces shown in the book.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter really likes to point out her favorite monsters for all of us to draw for her.  This book encourages creativity and independent artistry!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I love the Beatles but I was getting bored hearing the same songs for the last 35 years. This is the same Beatle music but all mixed together in a fresh, new way with alot of energy. It was all familiar yet new at the same time. Really well done!
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album is a real kick in the head.  Put it on and you are assaulted by non-stop aural overload that doesn't let up until the the microscopic pits on the CD fade to 0's. One interesting thing is how the group makes use of volume.  They will go from barely nudging the VU meters on some passages to overloading well into the red zone, completely distorting  their sound. They will fade out the instruments to a small point in the soundstage while the sound effects take over, then, the sound effects will fade out and the music come back with a vengeance.  This is a very interesting use of recording volume that is used to very good effect on this CD.  It is aurally challenging material and a table radio or cheap stereo may not do it justice.  The better your audio equip the better this CD will sound, because it is so sonically difficult to reproduce accurately.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I recently bought this DVD to replace two worn out VHS <br />tapes of Fawlty Towers that I taped off public television <br />19 years ago.  John Cleese and his then wife, American  <br />Connie Booth, co-wrote the series together back in the mid- <br />seventies, it's about a rude hotel owner and his interactions <br />with his guests and staff.  They spent a week writing each episode.  They sat side by side at a large table with a big roll of butcher paper <br />in front of them and they would write down story lines, plots, <br />funny words and sentences that would come to them.  Then they <br />would bring these ideas together - pretty amazing.  The humor <br />is fast paced with many plots and subplots merging brilliantly <br />in the end.  My favorites episodes are: \\"The Germans\\", \\"Basil <br />and the Rat\\" and the \\"Psychiatrist\\".  This is a great DVD!
B000002HMH|1.0|cruising regular radio today and one of the stations was Lite FM (just by the title you can tell what type of music it is) and I heard a song titled Mama Said. The voice sounded VERY FAMILIAR! When the song ended and by Metallica, I knew I was done! The last GOOD Metallica cd was.. well, you know. Cliff needs to be resurrected and whip the 3 horsemen back into shape! Long Live Cliff!<br /><br />NO STARS FOR ME!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dylan albums.  Mellower than most, with outstanding lyrics.  He communicates a reminiscent/reflective mode which comes through from the lyrics to the simple melodies.  The vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation reach deep into the soul and draw the listener into the reflection with him. When The Deal Goes Down is a wonderful affirmation of lifetime friendship and committment.  Nettie Moore draws deep from that same stream, where one has lost the companionship that noone else can replace.  Excellent!
B000J103X4|4.0|This CD is awesome. Pretty much every song I've gotten hooked on. I'm not good at writing long reviews for CD's but when I take the time to write something that means I'm pretty serious about how good a CD is. I HIGHLY recommend The Doctors Advocate, the beats are awesome, just everything about it is really good. Buy This CD!!
B000026HGT|5.0|Carly Simon remains one of the greatest singers of the 20th century and she continues her work even today. Her voice is strong, rich and full of energy; and the musical arrangements for her songs are brilliant. This album contains many of Carly's earliest runaway hits and these songs remain as fresh as ever. This CD proves it; and it brings back fond memories for those of us who danced through the `70s, too.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be.\\" This song deals with female depression as a result of antiquated expectations for a woman to settle down, marry young and have children. Carly also plays piano on this track as does Paul Griffin. The melody highlights the woman's disappointment about the direction she feels she \\"should\\" take in life.<br /><br />The CD switches gears rather quickly; the next song is the much happier \\"The Right Thing To Do.\\" Here Carly's character is passionately in love with her man as she celebrates each moment they spend together. \\"Mockingbird\\" is another song with a strong beat and musical arrangement. James Taylor sings with Carly and this is a real treat! Some reviewers write that they did not expect \\"Mockingbird\\" to be such a success for Carly Simon; and I agree with those reviewers. However, Carly could do anything at this time in her career and the song boasts a great musical arrangement with Dr. John on piano and organ. The vocals are very strong. Excellent!<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Haven't Got Time For The Pain\\" remains one of the most triumphant songs ever recorded. Carly sings to celebrate a new, true love that is her redemption from a life of pain and suffering. This touching song is still one of Carly's very best.<br /><br />Two gigantic hits on this album deserve special merit and attention: \\"You're So Vain\\" and \\"Anticipation.\\" The first song, \\"You're So Vain,\\" launches a sarcastic, scathing and belittling attack on a former lover of Carly's who hurt her at a time when she was in love and much less aware of how people can be cruel. Carly uses this song as both an outlet for her personal frustrations and as a ballad to describe the type of love relationship in which someone is fooled by the other's insincerity. Mick Jagger does background vocals on \\"You're So Vain\\" although the liner notes fail to give him credit for this. The second song, \\"Anticipation,\\" suffered a little bit because part of the main chorus was used in, of all things, a ketchup commercial on television. Fortunately time has passed and \\"Anticipation\\" is once again a great song instead of an advertising jingle. \\"Anticipation\\" also boasts some very pensive, philosophical lyrics about what the future has in store for Carly's affair with a man. There is a particularly insightful comment at the very ending of \\"Anticipation.\\" Carly sings that she will just enjoy the moment with her man without worrying what the future will bring \\"'cause these are the good old days.\\" Carly was right. The 1970s ARE \\"the good old days\\" for us in the year 2007. Excellent insight, Carly!<br /><br />The CD ends with the upbeat track entitled \\"Attitude Dancing.\\" A song that encourages freedom of expression is the perfect way to end this album. Carole King herself helps out on background vocals!<br /><br />After all is said and done, this CD of Carly Simon's earliest greatest hits contains nothing less than a five star collection of well written songs that are both strong and beautifully arranged. Each song can stand on its own as both a song and as a little story. The quality of the sound is excellent and the liner notes offer the lyrics and credits.<br /><br />Carly Simon will always be a special gift to us. Her ability to combine words and music produces beautiful and touching songs. Carly performs her songs with so much sensitivity you will be stunned as you listen to this CD. I highly recommend this CD for people who want to become more familiar with Carly Simon's earlier work as well as fans of `70s rock and pop music.ans of `70s rock and pop music. <br />
B0001XALTG|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because I liked the movie enough to buy it.  Lots of my friends don't like this movie at all, so it's just a matter of taste.  I would recommend you watch it before buying it, catch it on the IFC channel one night, they seem to play it every few months.
B000004712|3.0|I guess I was pleasantly surprised by this recording as, personally, I still use Maiden Voyage as a reference point for HH's work. The most fascinating thing for me is what the title hints at: putting new context on some well known pop songs.  Listening to the record felt a bit like enjoying some old vintage contained in what looks like new bottles! Worth purchasing and giving a good spin. >> Arthur A. Madonsela >> South Africa.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|one of the best muppet movies with humor for adults and children alike.  The human actors are excellent, of course the story line is classic, and the lesson is taught in a very entertaining fashion that won't give the little ones nightmares.
B000IFQLBE|5.0|A fine disc from a very good concert. very good songs are in this compilation. <br />Every John Fogerty Fan should have this disc.
0316236535|5.0|My little boy is in pre-school and one day we met with his two teachers.  Both of them said the same thing: Your boy LOVES this book.  He carries it with him all the time.  We had no idea but when we found out, we went right out and bought it for him. <br /> <br />He loves the anticipation of seeing the monster.  He starts naming the parts before we even change the pages.  Its fun for him and it helps him really learn the different parts of the face and colors. There are not a lot of words so that it is easy for him to follow and he rarely gets bored with it.  He enjoys it and it has been a quality purchase for us.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|I have to admit, I'm stubborn. I liked the first four Enigma CDs so much that I was determined to buy this, despite reading the reviews here that referred to it as directionless and disappointing. So I bought it...and <surprise> it IS disappointing, and not at all what I've come to expect of M. Cretu. I'm not saying Enigma can't have somewhat of a new sound, but this sounds like a compilation of tracks that were never released (for good reason.) Sadly, they WERE released, and most are either forgettable or obnoxious. Almost every track on Enigma's previous albums was of high quality, and I liked almost all of them. In contrast, I like 2 out of 11 tracks on Voyageur, not a good percentage. Buy A Posteriori instead, if you already have the first four albums and are looking for more.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|The war epic was revived with Franklin Schaffner's admirable 'Patton.' Schaffner's control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...<br /><br />George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a 'character actor' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...<br /><br />Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...<br /><br />Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and director Franklin J. Schaffner introduce a 16th-century warrior lost in contemporary times... He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...<br /><br />Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...<br /><br />The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans... Patton's first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command... His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...<br /><br />According to his theory of war, Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, slicing the island in half... But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals...<br /><br />Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton's abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...<br /><br />Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it's officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...<br /><br />The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton's superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton's dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley's careful planning...<br /><br />With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel's 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis ofRommel's published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: \\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\\" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...<br /><br />Karl Malden has the film's only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...<br /><br />Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton's remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...<br /><br />Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a 'yellow,' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton's views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn't hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it's easy to overlook Patton's own final words in the film, \\"All glory is fleeting.\\"<br /><br />Franklin J. Schaffner's motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about 'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,' who loved war...<br /><br />The Academy Awards saluted 'Patton' capturing eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor (Scott declined his well deserved Oscar), best screenplay, best editing, and best production design...s: \\"Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\\" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense...

B000001EGE|5.0|Being a diehard Eltonite since '71, of CORSE I LOVE this LP (ok, CD)... <br />We begin with Honky Cat (\\"WHOO\\"!). Next: we \\"mellow\\" out with \\"Mellow\\". <br />1 of my all time faves is \\" I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself!\\" as :1, it's a campy tongue in cheek number, & 2: at the time, I was in High School. <br />Enuff said! \\"Suzie (Dramas)\\" is next followed by my all time epic fave: <br />Rocket Man!!! Side 2 starts with \\"Salvation\\". Then \\"Slave\\"& rock out to <br />\\"Amy\\". Calming down with \\"Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters\\" & we conclude with (a cat named) \\"Hercules!\\" (EJ's middle name, as it were!) BOOGIE ON!!!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|A real eye opener that gets you motivated to do something about the global warming crisis. <br /> <br />A biography of Al Gore combined with his world tour presentation of the facts about global warming and what we can do about it.  Don't be afraid to find out the truth.  He proves his points and lets us know what can be done now, individually, to improve the situation in our corners of the world. <br />
B000816TCY|5.0|I bought two extra of these batteries because I heard they had a short charge life. I could easily get away with just one extra. I've shot pics and video with my S7c and had excellent life from these batteries.
B000GRUS22|5.0|As I listened to this CD, I wondered how the same person responsible for Voyageur could have produced this. Almost every track on A Posteriori is interesting, high-quality stuff that I would expect from a master like Cretu. The sound has evolved into more of a trance-electronica one than on the earlier albums, but it still has the intangible essence of Enigma written all over it. The album has a new sound, but at the same time it stays true to its roots. Well worth your time and money.
B0000YEEHG|4.0|In the early '60s, Bergman's visual and narrative style became ever more austere in focusing on tormented souls seeking guidance and comfort from an empty heaven, thus paving the way for a stark foray into extreme close-up in the enigmatic \\"Persona.\\"<br /><br />A modernist masterpiece, the film initiated an introspective trilogy about the ivory towers built by artists as a defense against the horror of existence... It was Bergman's first completely innovative work, acknowledging itself as artifice through the regular insertion of non-narrative images such as projectors burning, film breaking, fragment of silent movies...<br /><br />\\"Persona\\" depicts the vampiric relationship between a talkative nurse and an actress who refuses to speak or work after a traumatic realization of the futility of creation in a loveless world surrounded by war... Psychology, philosophy and social comment are mixed to brilliant effect in a complex, clear interrogation both of filmic illusion and of the illusory values of modern life...
B000I5X81A|5.0|I could listen to this cd over and over.  These two guys are two peas in a pod as they compile music together.  As we know, JJ Cale and Eric Clapton have been making magical music for many years together. Every song on this cd is great and brings back memories for baby boomers, especially. A simple life, a country free from war and appreciating the good times in life is what it is all about.  These two gentlemen have strings that not only make great music, but also, they have a strong string of songs that have made milestones in music history. <br />Thanks, guys, for a great cd!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This movie really defies categorization, which is what makes it so fun to watch.  At it's core it is really a Western, but the setting is in outer space and it has Zombie Slashers!  However, the real strength of the movie is in the script and characters.  Josh Whedon did a great job in assembling an ensemble and providing each one with a unique character that is both entertaining and believable as a person. <br /> <br />Plotting and pacing is fantastic, although there are a few edits in the action sequences that are a bit confusing as to what exactly is going on, and a couple pivotal words of the dialogue is garbled to my damaged ears.  But overall, a great film.  Enjoy!
B000JLTRIQ|2.0|This could have been a spectacularly produced action movie with dazzling special effects. And, I was hoping that the main feeling the movie intended to invoke in its viewers is a renewed horror and anger at what those scumbag terrorists did to this country on that infamous day. Instead, they focus on only two of the hundreds of heroes involved in the tragedy, and hone in on the same old warm and fuzzy feelings about kids and marriages \\"tainted\\" by stupid trivial things like remodeling kitchens--BORING! While the support that the two main characters lent each other, and resulting in both being rescued, is indeed inspiring, I thought the movie got way too focused on one little story of the whole incident, rather than showing what happened on a grander scale. Luckily I only rented the DVD and did not buy it--it's not worth it. You can buy any number of chick flicks in the $5.50 bin at WalMart.
B000003TBP|4.0|In typically schizophrenic style, Beck released the wildly uneven \\"Odelay\\" and cemented his stature in the freaky-lo-fi music scene. Lyrics and musical styles lurch from point to point with no discernable logic, defying known structure and co-existing. \\"Hot Wax\\" raps, funks and blows a folksy harmonica - and gets away with it. At this stage of the game, only the Beastie Boys were experimenting this madly and succeeding the way Beck was.<br /><br />Unlike the previous \\"Mellow Gold,\\" \\"Odelay\\" also had serious misfires. I can take a pass on \\"Lord Only Knows\\" and \\"Minus,\\" where to this day I can still listen to \\"Gold\\" in its entirety. But the highs are incredible:<br /><br />\\"Devil's Haircut\\"<br />\\"Hot Wax\\"<br />\\"Where It's At\\"<br />and \\"High 5\\"<br />are all stone classics.<br /><br />Beck was still going crazy with the cheeze-whiz on this record, and he was also one record away from his first less than stellar CD (\\"Mutations\\"). This was the last time he was still young and goofy, but it's worth it just to groove on the funkiest white-guy refrain of the 90s as frat cats all over the globe started chanting \\"I got two turntables and a microphone....\\"

I love being able to put the disc in my car CD player and just continualy hear what I need to boost my spirits and mood and get my mind on the right track. Then can go home and read over what Ijust heard. I already bought two more and sent them to friends who needed this. Thank you Louise
