B006WT2TZC|5.0|This is a great album, I love the way they remade some of their hits, and the way they covered the other tracks, WOW!
B006RXQ6FM|5.0|This movie has some great performances and in the end you just might have doubts yourself. Meryl Streep stars as a Nun/Principal who suspects her Priest of misgivings. However, since there is a chain of command in the Catholic church she has to find a way to reveal what she wants to know. I recommend that when watching this movie for the first time you dont have any distractions, some of the nuances and character revelations can be easily missed and some make the movie truly great. Like when she first has the priest in her office watch closely on where everyone sits. Great movie!
0307454568|3.0|Spoilers in this review!<br /><br />Verdict: Better than The Girl Who Played With Fire, lacks the novelty value of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />As with the other books in the trilogy, this one starts slow. It also, like #2, suffers from a multiplicity of bureaucrats and police, good and bad. I had a very hard time getting into the story until well past the halfway mark. One reason, I think, is that Larsson essentially writes like a journalist. There is detailed backstory on characters - the whole career of various members of the police  and security forces - as well as the Security Police itself. Some writers can carry this off and make it fascinating. In my opinion, Larsson does not.<br /><br />Another problem with this book: Too much Berger, not enough Salander. Salander is the chief draw for these books, so why sideline her for most of the way? The entire plot about Berger and SMP was extraneous to the main plot. When you have a 600-page-plus book, you don't need that.<br /><br />If you hang in till the final third, the trial scenes almost make up for all the other problems. Here is the tension and drama I expected all along, based on the reviews and wild popularity of the series. Again, though - too little Salander. If the trial was the climax of the book, the denouement was surprisingly well-handled. I liked that most of the plot strands were tied up, but not with a pretty bow. The depiction of Salander post-trial seemed appropriate, and almost like a return to character after her superwoman role in Book 2. The final confrontation was surprisingly acceptable, though leaving a bit of a bad taste.<br /><br />As usual, we have to have a plot about love-them-and-leave-them Blomqvist. Why must women always be left mooning over this guy? That was another story that could have been trimmed.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms of all three books, I do have to give it to Larsson that he created a little world here, and I'm almost sorry to leave. I'd have liked to see where he might have gone with Lisbeth in a whole new story.ed to see where he might have gone with Lisbeth in a whole new story.
1400049628|3.0|This is a good fun read. You will learn everything you need to know on surviving the zombie apacolype. It is really more detailed and accurate than I could have imagined. My three star rating is simple. I read Word War Z first. Easily one of my favorite books of all time. That one had so much action in it that I almost got a little bored reading these survival tips. But it is what it advertises. A survival guide and from everything from weapons, exercise routines, housing, food etc etc et..... This recorded attacks where the best part. It seems to clash with World War Z's cannon though.
0786958731|5.0|This is the first Dungeon and Dragons Board Game I purchased, I have played D&D for a while now. I have to say it is enjoyable and had a great time playing. I have only played with one other person and I am looking forward to playing with a full party.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I don't know how many zombie books there are out there that people would consider a literary classic. But this will day be in that class. I am not in the hype just because there is a movie coming out about it either.... The book is set up with a series of interviews about the zombie apacolypse. At first it takes a little getting use to. The characters change and I was a little flustered that I was moving all over the place. But then as I kept reading I started gaining the true magnitute of what an apacolypse truely was. I wasn't focused on any paticular group of people, any single city or even country for too long. It took on a global feel. I could feel the entire worlds greif and how it affected everyone from all of Europe down to a deserted island... When you see it on that scale you will read about the drastic measures they took to win the war and understand it was truely for the greater good... I can't say anymore. If you are a fan of zombies in anyway and can appreciate good literature then this is a MUST read!
0316098337|5.0|Believe the hype! This is really a novel that you will read straight through. The narration from a five year old boy's perspective is an absolute revelation. Donoghue has crafted a novel that is engaging, while still packing a large emotional punch. This is probably the best novel I will read this year.

B00514HDNW|5.0|I came by Richard Matheson through his writing for The Twilight Zone. This is the first of his novels I've read and it definitely will not be the last. Though written in 1954 it doesn't feel dated at all. The story is well-paced, thoughtfully written, and easy to follow. I really enjoyed Matheson's writing style. The ending is superb; thoughtful and appropriate. It's no wonder this book is a modern classic. I can't recommend it enough.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun until the very end!! 5 stars for sure. the whole point system is neat. you have to unclock all of the other games with your points!!
B0042YHC38|1.0|Nice design but you can not tight properly to your arm; the band is too short and the material is not a stretch one
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I will try to make this short and to the point. I kept seeing the previews for this movie and since I love books way more than movies I decided to look it up. Reading all the great reviews, I decided to buy it. I literally could not put this book down. I read it in one day and now I will start the second book. I am not a woman who cries at anything. Actually everybody who knows me has said how they have never seen me cry. Even my husband (of 13 years) makes fun of me sometimes saying that he has only seen me cry a handful of times. But this book brought me to tears more than once. It's written in such a wonderful way that you can really picture what's going on in the book without even trying. All I can say is if you buy this book you will not be disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Life changing. I love being able to listen to my Bible using different versions. Love 364NT+. Love reading by author.

B004ZJZQJC|5.0|In the tradition of \\"TRON\\" (1982), we have the classic challenge.  This formula movie is a bit technically challenged due to being released in 1984.  However, this is one \\"rite of passage\\" tale that would have interested Joseph Campbell author of \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces.\\"<br /><br />Alex Rogan (Lance Guest) is stuck in a small trailer community and it looks like he will be going to City College. He dreams of being more.  Due to a misplaced video game (a game?  No a test) he gets the opportunity to more than fulfill his dream and save The Star League form Xur (Norman Snow) and the KO-DAN armada as the last starfighter.<br /><br />This film has well selected actors as if the parts are written for them; this especially includes Robert Preston of \\"Music Man\\" fame.  By the way this was Robert Preston's last movie. Also, watch Catharine Mary Stewart who has appeared in episodes of \\"The Outer Limits.\\"<br /><br />Can he do it?  In the mean time who is looking out for his girl?<br /><br />Recently applied to Blu-ray to keep up with the transfer from tape to DVD to Blu-ray to whatever is next.<br />------------------------------------------<br />Advantages and disadvantages of the Blu-ray. The voice-over commentary by director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb fill in the information that is only implied in the movie. It is like having someone pointing out that your shoe is untied. However you now know what to notice the next time around.<br /><br />The 1984 graphics after the Blu-ray treatment looks more sharp and cartoony. Luckily the film is a classic and you overlook the CGI.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disk contains all the standard goodies as a D-box option, voice-over, and sketches of the various actors.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001AQMBNC Starman [Blu-ray] ~ Jeff Bridges]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000K7UEMW Joseph Campbell - The Hero's Journey]]
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Leave behind all of your preconceptions about books with vampires and other mythical creatures. This book won't come close to those. And for good reason.<br />This is a fresh, fun, gripping, and smoothly written story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters come to life and are lifted from the page, each one with their own very distinct personality and voice. Rebecca Hamilton has taken a classic idea and spun it into a beautiful world beyond any expectations...and this is why preconceived notions of what you think is in this book will fall short of what is actually written. It is truly a mind blowing read.<br /><br />Now for the story...<br /><br />You are introduced to Sophia, plunged right into her life with the different conflicts that she faces on a daily basis. An angry, God fearing woman, tries to force her out of her Grandfather's house. Being left to her in his will, she's not so willing to do that. And how can she? With the loud buzzing in her head that drowns out even her own thoughts. Desperately, she makes her way to her mentors shop for some supplies to do a ritual that she hopes will silence the sound for good. Instead, what she is greeted with is a man lurking outside her window, figures that disappear into the night, and a chain of events that leads her further into a world she never wanted to belong in.<br /><br />And then, there's Charles. The man that she can't deny, and not from lack of trying. But then Ivory, her best friend who has secrets of her own, manages to undo everything Sophia and Charles had planned.<br /><br />This story ends with the loss of friends and family, but ends with newly kindled friendships, some of Sophia's most pressing questions about her past and her family answered, a goal made by the Universe hundreds of years ago, and the promise of a war so great that it could undo the very fabric of our world.<br /><br />This was only the first in the series. I can't wait to read more! This book has definitely set a new standard in the world of Fantasy.new standard in the world of Fantasy.

0741470314|5.0|I had been looking for this book about Micheal for so long. I have read just about everything to grasp at wanting to learn more and more about him and the more we learned about him the more he became mysterious. I have always loved Michael from before Off the Wall and Thriller. At 16 I was at his concert and there was nothing between him and I except the stage. I was so close that I could see him look at his father and smile for approval literally back stage. He took off his jacket and threw it to the audience and his father instructed a body guard to pick it up. It did not make it to the audience. I looked up at him in awe and I knew that he was always special. What I liked about the book ( I bought the kindle PC version) due the the cost and eargerness I had to read it.<br />When I read about his humanitarian work and the little boy whos father set him on fire in a hotel room that we all read about and forgot Michael spent his entirely life taking care of him and that is when I broke down. His work was in secret and his dedication to all man kind is massaiah like. I have beleived in Michael I have never for one second beleived he would do that to any child. He was pure not perfect but close.  The book was forever enlightend and showed me what I always knew in my heart that  He was a good man and a spirital man and man that was human. His devotion, care and concern for his fans were unbeleivable. I still mourn Michael everyday EVERYDAY.I have listend to his music everyday for over a year. There were things I wanted to explore and know about Michael not his personal life but the fasinated way he displayed his music. the sounds the tapestry of how he put it into words and melodies, how He he he, yeah yeah could sound so good and shamone,and the lows and high pitches of his voice could be explored on records like who is it, dangerous, threatned, speechless, and Unbreakable.  I am so fasinated at how he was such an artist. that made was a genious and I miss him. What the book did was made me cry, cry and cry some more. I am glad that there were people in his life that were truly loyal to him. When he asked \\"should I read it Boyd\\" I cried because I could only imagine the fear and terror in his soul about reading such hate. The power of an accusation crippled that man and it crippled a nation. How could we call ourselfs human in the likeness of God and do the things we do to other human beings. I am sure that all the hatred towards Michael was out of jealousy, fufusing to conform to what they thought to be \\"normal\\" it is the same thing that has plagued our existance from the beginning of time. I ask this question when did the \\"true God\\" give anyone such authority to determine that they are worthy of being treated like a human being\\" worthy of love, careing and acceptance for being an individual. There are apples red and green they may taste a little different but they are still apples. We are human being we may look different (colore, features) but we are still human beings. Michael was ablel to do for human kind like Martin Luther King, and Ghandi were ablt to do with their spirit. Not with guns, weapons, or degrading words.He united Mankind with Music and that was a powerful gift that was by God. He accomplished things that the Beatles, Elvis Presely was not able to do. There was never a time when the Bealtle, or Elvis Preseley would have played to a all black audience. I found it appauling that people would treat a human being like that because he exercised the right to do whatever he wanted to his body and didn't affect anyone. People say he was a man-child may we all be so lucky to find balance in that. Who is the abnormal one here maybe its all of us and not so much him. As we all should excercise and take a look back into our childhood and remember daydreaming, drawing, and using our creative juices to explore things beyond our boundries. He was doing for the poor long before Oprah, Bono and any other stars I think they gottheir inspiration from him. The united states did not start giving to less fortunate until the mid 1970 due to strong critisim from other third world countries. He gave away fortunes. But he made deals and money from the more privlage and that were the executives. I was so impressed by Micheal's business sense. When she broke down how much of a percentage of a company he owned fifty or one hundred percent I was in awe and shouted you are the man. No child made those kind of financial deals. Thank you for writing the book and the guards and many people who participated in the book and were honest and not trying to smudge this man who was born to be king. May we all inspire to dare to dream to be worthy to be in the likeness of God of Jesus. He would read his Bible almost every day they said. If your soul  is righteous and your spirit is true you would have saw him. But if your sprit is corrupted and your soul is false and dark you saw the reflection of yourself. You did not see him you saw a mirror of your greed , jeaulousy, your contempt. I pity those who betrayed him and I hope that God will not be merciful on them.

B005LCECU6|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars, except for the mistake of including three \\"bonus\\" tracks of horrible bootleg quality (sounds like the recording was made in somebody's pants from the next building) that otherwise detracts from a nearly perfect CD. The main show recorded in 1974 has been remastered and the sound quality is quite good but not perfect by any means. However the inclusion of: 1) some extremely rare Rush tracks like Fancy Dancer, Garden Road, and Bad Boy (a cover); 2) Neil's early blueprint for his signature drum solo; 3) the boys shredding several tunes off the first Rush album; and 4) a few preview tracks off their not-yet-released-at-the-time Fly By Night album -- more than makes up. The photography on the packaging is not historically accurate either (most likely taken in 1978 or 1979 during the Hemispheres world tour), but still a great value for the money. I highly recommend it to the true Rush fan.

B005OHSTY8|1.0|I love many Kevin Smith movies, I like most of the rest, but I HATE this movie.  I made it through the whole thing unlike many who turned it off after 30 minutes.  Unfortunately it just keeps getting worse.  John Goodman is pretty good in it but that's about it.  The film is nothing but static characters, silly plot twists, non-sensical acts and there are no real protagonists...  Cop Out is GENIUS compared to this crap...  Kevin Smith should be ashamed and should do better.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|this book became my favorite read. i have recommended it to many. heartwarming and funny. sad and thoughtful. makes you want to hug your family and your dog.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this series.  I was almost heartbroken when I thought it ended at 4.  So glad I got closure!  Or should I say \\"bound off\\"?  I still wonder about the wool/knitting metaphor.  Very odd choice, but as a knitter and a science fiction fan, I found it an extraordinary pairing.  Well written with good character development and story line, with the kind of social examination one expects from classic sci-fi.  Highly recommend!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't express how much I enjoyed this novel.  As I read the great story I felt as if I was living in the 50's and 60's for the first time (I'm only 29).  King has done it again.  I recommend this novel to anyone, regardless of age.
B004LWZW88|5.0|This was one of the most entertaining films I've seen recently. Antonio Banderas brings his Zorro charm and sexiness to this feline. The 3-D was wonderful in theaters but the film can be enjoyed on its own terms in 2D as well. I highly recommend it.
0307279189|5.0|A highly recommended book for running enthusiasts. It busts all the myths associated with \\"stability\\", \\"cushioned\\" running shoes, stretching/not-stretching, and running injuries (in fact throwing a light on how cushioned shoes actually INCREASE the running injuries). I had been wanting to get serious about running, but just as the author described, I was in too much pain to even run a whole mile. The book has renewed my interest in running for \\"happiness\\" and in its most natural form.<br />Reading this book makes me wonder if, except the advances in communication technology and medical surgery, have other so-called advances really made our lives better or worse -- soft foam mattresses, fat-free (processed) food with unwholesome contents, cosmetic products loaded with petroleum by-products (to keep the prices low)!<br />Our ancestors have to be called luckier than us to have not been \\"cursed with the boon of lab-experiments\\" (pun intended)!

Then I had to buy another set for myself. I love the idea of everyone all over the world singing together for peace, & I love  the music as well. This is so beautifully put together that when you watch the DVDs, it brings tears to your eyes.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|I had forgotten how many songs I liked from years ago (when they were first popular) that were from Led Zeppelin. This album had quite a number of those songs.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|The main content of the book is given in the promotional video. The book add stories, stories and more stories, about this guy and that girl, much like the story in the promotional video. There is not much new in terms of developing a systematic approach to how to change habit - that is: not much new compared to what is already in the promotional video. That simple idea is interesting though, so it got 2 stars.<br /><br />As long as the promotional video is available, watch that. If you also like stories, buy a collection of short stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this book, but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down and before I knew it I'd read the entire trilogy within a week. I am now a hardcore hunger games nerd and cannot wait for the movie to come out!!

Learning these cards wasn't difficult at all.  I suggest to read the whole book over before you get into the deck though that way you can get the full experience of these cards.  Great buy.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I've tried this game before but with the recent updates I can't play anymore. The game has a lot of connection issues and constantly force closes. BEWARE this is an app that wants you to purchse gems which cost real money. I've lost several gems to connection issues when trying to back out of menus, close popups, and when trying to cook food. At times the game stalls and double registers taps, then *poof* you've lost gems to speed cook food or revive spoiled food you in no way wanted or intended on doing. I've emailed support several times and they do NOT refund gems even purchased ones that were lost in this way. The game can be fun and quite addictive but some of the issues I've stated can make it hard to enjoy.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Book two in the Hunger games trilogy shows that Suzanne Collins had a very good idea for one novel, but was contracted to stretch it out to three.<br />This book serves only as a bridge for the third book. One could get the coles notes and skip it entirely.
B0055SWM08|5.0|So relaxing.  5 minutes after I started playing it,it became my favorite game.<br />I don't usually play a game's music, but Quell,s music actually enhances the relaxing experience.

B007BT0RKG|2.0|I downloaded to my Kindle Fire thinking it would help in our travels. It has nice maps BUT it does NOT work in finding your location without WiFi connection, I've tried repeatedly to view my location by turning the wifi on then off, it just doesnt work. I can only see my location with \\"wifi turned on\\" which maybe a problem when trying to maneuver around a unfamiliar city. Also theres the \\"unexpected MapWithMe has Stopped\\" and having to Force close problem. Definitely has some bugs that needs to be addressed. Nice maps though.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Cancer, perhaps the most fearsome of diseases, plays no favorites.  It strikes the young and the old, the active and the sedentary, the healthy and the infirm.  It is relentless and almost always tragic.  So, it is with trepidation that one approaches a book that is sure to be laden with gruesome deaths and almost always very bad outcomes.  In the end, however, this is a book of hope.  Even though death rates from most cancers have remained stubbornly unchanged, science now seems to be closing circle after circle in understanding the way cancer functions.  Drugs have now been developed that add years to the lives of many cancer patients.  This is the story of the search for the secrets of cancer and the creation of selective poisons that can extend useful life.<br /><br />Dr. Mukherhee, an oncologist at Columbia University, approaches this history of cancer with the skill of a novelist telling a great story of discovery.  There is a lot to tell.  The treatment of cancer has moved through many stages since its first recorded case more than 4500 years ago. There are many different forms of cancer.  It is only in the last 50 years or so that science has learned enough about cancer cells to develop molecules that can attack the weak links in the cancerous cell.  Nevertheless, the cancer cell under attack has a remarkable ability to mutate and thereby to change its defense mechanisms.  These complex processes enable the cancer cell to evade the poisons that biotechnology is now creating.<br /><br />Science has come a long way in understanding the processes that enable cancer cells to thrive and multiply.  As for the future, Mukherhee concludes that the business of forecasting the future pace of scientific progress in controlling cancer is a very tough job.  Are we one or two fabulous insights away from interrupting the biodynamics of the cancer cell or will it take far, far more?  Mukherhee concludes there is no single, universal cure in sight.  The mountain facing biology is steep and very, very high.  Nevertheless, the tools to understand what is needed are increasingly available and that gives scientists hope.<br /><br />No commentary on Mukherhee's book would be complete without noting his extraordinary powers of expression and analysis.  He writes on a very difficult subject with great clarity.  He makes the internal machinery of the cancer cell, to the extent we now know it, entirely understandable.  In addition, it is obvious from his references that he is widely read in the literature of many different cultures and disciplines.<br /><br />This is a terrific book, one that strangely enough, despite its inherently depressing theme, is difficult to put down.
0385534639|3.0|This book intrigued me from the beginning, the author does a great job of introducing the characters, setting the scene and creating wonderful images in my head. As the book progressed I started to loose interest, it seemed slow. I so wanted to love this book as it just started off in such a magical and gripping way. I may come back to this book later on, perhaps it was my frame of mind at the time I was reading it.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I have read a few of Dawkins other books, but this one was by far the best structured and easiest to read. The principle argument is that there is ample proof that there is no mythical being that created this world (and associated universe). Dawkins lays out his arguments in a well reason structure that seeks to provide overwhelming evidence to support this conclusion.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Rambo series is an awesome movie to add to my Blu-Ray collection. If you collect classic movies then this is a must have!!!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|It is nice to have all of the Harry Potter movies in one case.  The case is made a bit cheaply, comes apart, not easy to close always, but it works.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Great bundle for a good price. Movie looks amazing on Blu-Ray!!! A must have for Spider-Man or just superhero fans!!!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|There are not enough superlatives to describe the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin, but the same cannot be said for Game of Thrones, the TV series from HBO. This is a fantastic show, but only because its source material is so astoundingly great. The contributions of the people who adapted the show are rather mediocre.<br /><br />David Benioff and D.B. Weiss just are not very good script writers. The budget is borderline inadequate--each major character wears the same outfit throughout the entire first season. The short length of each season means a lot of what makes the books great gets cut.<br /><br />So why did I give this 5 stars? Well, it's still better than 99% of the shows on television and needs to be judged by that standard, not the standard set by the books.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|This product works the same as the one they sell for $70. I received mines a couple of days after ordering and all I have to say is it's was worth it!!! So if the two little \\"18\\" labels on the box don't matter to you, order this one...... Spend the rest of the money on ordering something else, I did. Rambo Box Set!!!

0143119680|2.0|I really really wanted to like this book.  I just didn't.  The first half I thought it could still get interesting, it did not. It moved so slowly and was unnecessarily vague and confusing.  I really wanted to like the main characters Diana and Matthew, there was just not much I liked.  Diana was a bit too much of a know it all, and stubborn just for the sake of being stubborn, because for some reason that is what contemporary writers think make a strong female character.  I am quite frankly sick of this, you don't have to be obnoxious to be a strong woman.  Matthew  was just boring.  Their relationship was boring.  There was way too much detail about meals eaten, and clothing being picked out.  I don't need to know that Diana's leggings are holey because she is just to \\"intelligent\\" to give a damn about her appearance.  Once again this another personality trait that writers think make a strong liberated woman. Being unconcerned with your appearance does not make you a strong woman, it just makes you a woman in faded holey leggings with messy hair.  The story was choppy, and the important details were left out to describe the wine vintages that the vampire likes to drink, instead of wrapping up what the big deal with manuscript was.  WHY IS THE VAMPIRE CONSUMING ANYTHING BESIDES BLOOD?!?!? When push came to shove, I just didn't care if Diana and Matthew worked it out or not. I didn't care if the Congregation came to get them, and I didn't care if Diana learned how to use her magic.  What she doesn't care the first 3/4 of the book now all of a sudden she is embracing her whitchiness?  It would have been much more interesting if she had always wanted to use her magic and had never been successful and now all of a sudden it was miss firing.  But her stubborn denial of what she is was just annoying.  I just wanted to be done with it by the end....and then when I did get to the end, my response was really?  Nothing was wrapped up....it was just left hanging there so there can be a squeal which I will not be reading because I truly don't care what happens.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|I think its hilarious how people complain about permissions. Theres a good chance that these same people have a Facebook account yet they dont realize how much information they're giving out with it. They also probably know nothing about the coding and development process. 5 stars to the devs because I feel like it.

B006UG90RM|4.0|I won't get into the mastering, compression side of things just an opinion on the music itself. When I first heard that VH was putting out a new album, my first thought was will they capture the magic they did on the first few albums? I do believe they did. I have to say I'm quite surprised. Eddie is shredding as usual just burning up the fretboard and DLR vocals sound great. I found myself listening over and over again. This album convinced me to go see them live (Philly 3/5). Some of my favorites are Tattoo, She's the Woman, The Trouble with Never, Big River and my favorite on the album Stay Frosty (Nice bluesy feeling to it). Lots of great riffs to keep you coming back for more. What are you waiting for? Go get it and crank it up! and most importantly...STAY FROSTY!
0553801473|2.0|Apologists for the sadism that pervades this series say that its purpose is to upend the myth of the courtly ideal, showing us the vicious collateral consequences for the silent majority of unceasing wars for power.  If this were actually the author's goal, one would expect the silent majority to play more than a bit role in this morality tale: there might be some tears shed, for example, for the two miller's sons whose heads are chopped off as a ruse to substitute for the two aristocratic children, Bran and Rickon.  But no: those nameless children are only archetypes, not real people with whom we might empathize.  Running counter to the apologists is the author's underlying reactionary idea that there is something special and unique about the \\"blood of kings.\\"  Some genetic difference between kings and lords on the one hand and the peasants on the other cause the entire population (other than the wildlings) as well as the author to obsess about legitimacy and bloodlines.  The fact that this is \\"real\\" in the author's mind is evident from the fact that Daenerys, with the \\"blood of the dragon\\" running in her princess veins, is the only one who can hatch and tame dragons; and the Stark children, with the \\"blood of the First Men\\" in their veins, are among the very few who can enter into the minds of other beings and take on their perspectives.  Moreover, it is only a sacrifice from the \\"blood of kings\\" that can appease the red god and bring forth demons to do his bidding.<br /><br />So, what is the justification for the cannibalism, the voyeurism, the sadistic tortures, the tongues ripped out, the skin flayed, the hands, fingers and toes cut off, the eyes gouged out, the burnings alive, the hangings, the beheadings, the slit throats, the cheeks bit off, and on and on?  I submit that the author gets some frisson of pleasure from these and he knows full well how to play to the baser instincts of his audience.  Why are we allowing this author to play to our worst instinctsin this way?  And why aren't we asking why?<br /><br />Beyond the sadism is the clear and pervasive misogyny of the series.  The author is obsessed with whores, and as the series has progressed he seems to have multiplied his references to prostitutes and whorehouses so that there is a reference practically every page in the fifth book.  The author further denigrates women by having even the heroic characters patronizingly refer to any woman as a \\"sweetling,\\" as if their only purpose is to present themselves as a sweet thing to men, an irritating trope that occurs hundreds of times.  The women characters themselves fall into three stereotyped categories:  the evil, the dumb, and the ones who manage to figure out how to behave like men, and it's only the third category who carry any real interest.<br /><br />This series is obviously immensely popular, but consider whether it is so in part because of an appeal to our worst instincts, and to our most reactionary views about some natural and hereditary aristocracy.  These sorts of ideas, when unquestioned, tend to have an insidious effect on the way we think.  It's especially concerning to see these books showing up again and again on teens' \\"favorite series\\" lists.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|Love, love, love having this. You can watch it being done, read how to do it, see what it works.<br /><br />The only thing I wish I had was the ability to create my own workout routine, instead of choosing one of three pre-made lists.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool (Omnibus Edition) has the best story I've read so far this year. Great pace, the sentences are just oozing with emotion. Wonderful, likable characters (except when we're not supposed to like a character of course, in which case the character seems despicable). The world painted by the author is vivid and thought out. Definite BUY and then lock yourself in a room and read in one sitting.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Its a game that my 2 year old and I.love to play it together it is really good for cause and effect games. And even if he crushes all the groceries he still has.fun with it.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|This documentary doesn't go nearly as far enough, if it did it would come to the conclusion that this crash was indeed an inside job and was supposed to happen. We have witnessed the biggest transfer of wealth in modern history. They're laughing at us, all the way to the bank.
B000002KKC|4.0|'Rumors' is without question Fleetwood Mac's most successful album to date.  'Tusk' is a refreshing change.  Along with their 1975 'Fleetwood Mac' album,'Tusk' is in a trilogy of their three best albums.  With 'Tusk', they are still in their creative prime.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|This converter arrived on time and was easy to install but after working well for about 1 hour, it suddenly stopped working, making a repetitive clicking noise.  All audio stopped and the light on the converter continuously flashed.  It was not possible to reset, turn off and on and correct the problem.  I returned it to Amazon for a refund.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|It's one of the most intense movies you'll see and on top of that it has such an amazing story line.  Two brothers whose childhood had been torn apart by their alcoholic father compete in a worldwide fighter tournament \\"to find out who the toughest guy on the planet is.\\"  Oddly enough later in the brothers lives it's the father who is trying to repair time lost, and the brothers want nothing to do with each other or their father.  One brother is a science teacher, and the other a marine and war hero, though the world doesn't know it. This movie is so much more than fighting...and I couldn't imagine someone not being touched by this film.  Watch it, just watch it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|They're great because they're loud and stay on your head. I deducted 1 star because one of the wires came loose and I'm only getting sound from the left as a result. Still, considering the price I still went ahead and purchased a replacement. Better than spending more on other ear bud headphones which don't stay in the ears well, aren't as loud and could possibly have the same problem.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|used it all the time, especially handy while in Costa rica...we used this to find legit excursions and good restaurants
B0054JELS4|2.0|I bought this product for $160 so I was expecting it to work, however discs six through eight all skip.  I can't return the product so basically I wasted $160. I'm pretty mad about it and prolly wont order from Amazon again.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every so often, one comes across an authour which totally flattens him. Happened to me several years ago with Neal Stephenson, and ever since, I've read everything he wrote. The same happened with Hugh Howey. Never heared of him, just browsing the store, read some reviews and tried it. What a pleasant surprise. Read the entire 500 pages during a 4 day vacation, couldn't let the book down. It's not just the subject, it's the way the book is written. I already downloaded a second book (Hurricane) and I'm half way through. I'm just as pleased with the second selection as I am with the first.

0143119680|1.0|This book was compared to Elizabeth Kostova's \\"The Historian\\" a few times--it's not even in the same ball park. \\"A Discovery\\" had a lot of potential: an interesting twist on witch, vampire and demon mythology that melded science and magic, an interesting dynamic between different magical creatures, and a nice tie in to history with a character who's seen and known countless events and figures. What could go wrong? After about a few chapters, everything. The main character Diana was introduced as a self-sufficient, intelligent and independent women. Enter Matthew, the 7 foot tall Roman sculpture come to life, and Diana's strong resolve and initial personality dissolves. After they fall in love it goes completely downhill, the dynamic between the two of them shifting to something that isn't really fun to read (apparently she's incapable of falling asleep unless it's on/with him and completely loses her spunk in every way possible since he does practically everything for her). Romance certainly isn't a bad thing, but the plot surrounding the much sought-after manuscript (which was noted to be the central plot of the novel) takes a seat on the back-burner while the reader is subjected to a corny love story where every sentence spoken by Matthew to Diana is started with a pet name in French. A bucket nearby helped with the increasing amount of gagging that occurred as I struggled to finish the book.<br /><br />This is definitely not anything close to \\"The Historian,\\" which was incredibly well-written, well-researched, and had characters for whom you truly felt. It had a love story that felt realistic and mature, as well as a plot that didn't get lost in boring side stories and a romance that happens teenagers' daydreams of what married life will be like.<br /><br />Unless you're craving a sappy love story, character's who really don't draw much emotion from you, and a story that wanders aimlessly without ever being reeled in, don't waste your time or your money.

B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Love this game!! At $1.00 a game, and its 100 games for $9.99, its a pretty good deal. I know some people have felt like they got ripped off, but the product review does say 1 game with download, and the rest are for purchase.<br />And when you think about it, the $9.99 price point is pretty good, since we pay up to that an more for apps on the Fire, or any other tablet or phone. So the product review is pretty easy to understand.<br />For those of us that grew up in the '70's and '80's will have an insane fondness for these games. And how much we miss these systems, despite how poor the controls were, and the graphics were sometimes, decent, at best, but still love them till the day we die.<br />Now I am just waiting for Pitfall and Donkey Kong, and my childhood will be complete. =) Thank you very much.

B005COO1X6|5.0|King is a master at evoking an era. Just as he brought me back to my college days in Hearts in Atlantis, I was transported to places like Dallas and New Orleans where I had never been and felt the milieu to be a genuine recreation of those bitter days before and after a decent man, JFK, was slain. A must read for anyone who would understand how much Lee Harvey Oswald both changed and defamed my generation. If he were truly the lone assassin, may he rot in hell for infinity.

0393064476|2.0|Having grown up on a wide variety of  reading, including the stilted styles of some historians, I was able to read The Swerve with some patience but was  glad not to have recommended it to my book club.  The subject - the boosting of the budding renaissance via the re-discovery of Lucretius' surprisingly intuitive first C BC text - is fascinating to those interested in modern thought, but the delivery was unfortunate.  Odd that a highly published Harvard scholar specializing in Shakespeare should be so awkward with a story.  On the other hand, I now have insight into the tilt of the National Book Award, Newsweek and NPR reviewers who so loved it.  Part of loving books is knowing how to filter the reviewers.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Loved the trilogy. I never re-read books, especially right away. But I was so sad to come to an end and I immediately started over and read the trilogy again from the beginning, and I am sure I will do it again soon. If anyone has recommendations for a similar great love story, please tell me!

1851687793|4.0|Well, it certainly has a unique selling point.<br /><br />A quixotic quest, you would think: rendering the world of quantum physics understandable for the layman - approached quixotically: by fabricating a dialogue between the author, a physics professor, and his rabbit-chasing, treat-loving Alsatian dog.<br /><br />There is something oddly Socratic about Orzal's interlocutions with Emmy the Alsatian. Only in the Dialogues, no-one says \\"that sounds ridiculous, Socrates\\". Emmy has no such qualms.<br /><br />As a conceptual device it works as well as it can be expected to, though at times both Chad and Emmy expect too much of their readers. That is one smart dog.<br /><br />Over the years I've read plenty of popular science treatments of quantum physics (more than your average bear, I dare say, but of course that's not to say I necessarily understood them), and I still found my eyes glazing over at some of the depth to which Orzal was obliged (or at any rate inclined) to descend in expounding quantum theory. Emmy stays with him throughout, and eggs him on.<br /><br />I have always harboured suspicions about the scientific inviolability claimed of this sort of physics. Real, falsifiable empirical evidence seems in short supply (often being suspiciously forbidden by the very terms of the theory, or at least buried under many sedimentary layers of mathematical assumption) and quantum effects have a habit of conveniently being unobservable in any dimension meaningful to everyday life. Or vanishing (er, I mean, collapsing the wave function) when you try to measure them.<br /><br />Which, to this old sceptic, gives them a religious sort of disposition - true by definition; true because smart men learned in arcane lore say so. (I should say I'm not alone in this view: properly credentialised physicists like Peter Woit and Lee Smolin have also expressed it).<br /><br />That said, Orzal is no (ahem) dogmatist (indeed, trying to de-mystify the scriptures as he does makes him more like a sort of Lutheran reformer), and I think is prepared to admit of some missing links in the overall theory (I couldn't work out whether quantum entanglement, which is \\"non local\\", falsifies relativity or not).<br /><br />Then again, the only practical upshot I could derive of all this colossally brain-contorting discipline is the possibility of \\"quantum computing\\" - apparently faster and cheaper than boring old silicon.<br /><br />Orzal's main objective, finally arrived at in the closing chapter, is to debunk phoney new age baloney which purports to trade on quantum underpinnings - quantum healing, and that kind of thing. This is done effectively, but at some cost: by underlining the singular uselessness of quantum theory in every day volumes, velocities and quantities. Whenever it would come in handy (often, when chasing squirrels, as Emmy astutely observes), by its own theory, quantum effects would be unobservably minuscule.<br /><br />Which makes this old goat wonder why we bother digging up the Swiss countryside and dropping trillions of dollars of supercooled electromagnets into it just to find another unobservable subatomic particle. Surely we can figure out whether quantum computing works by trying to building a quantum computer?<br /><br />In the final analysis, and as other reviewers have said, I put this book down having a better general understanding of the gist of a number of really quite difficult concepts - enough to keep my end of the conversation up if sat next to a physicist at dinner - even if the details and implications below that remain entirely murky - and so in that regard, it is a tough job imaginatively and successfully done.<br /><br />And, now matter how cute the device seems, you can't help but like the irrepressible Emmy, even if she does understand Schrodinger's indeterminacy better than I do.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonre like a sort of Lutheran reformer), and I think is prepared to admit of some missing links in the overall theory (I couldn't work out whether quantum entanglement, which is \\"non local\\", falsifies relativity or not).<br /><br />Then again, the only practical upshot I could derive of all this colossally brain-contorting discipline is the possibility of \\"quantum computing\\" - apparently faster and cheaper than boring old silicon.<br /><br />Orzal's main objective, finally arrived at in the closing chapter, is to debunk phoney new age baloney which purports to trade on quantum underpinnings - quantum healing, and that kind of thing.

0205313426|5.0|This book teaches you the core fundamentals of sound writing. I've referred back to it so many times over the years, I've had to buy several copies because they kept wearing out.<br /><br />In less than forty pages, this book will give you the tools you need to take your technical skills to a professional level. Beware, though--this isn't a book you can just casually read from cover to cover. This is a book that you must read carefully and studiously. When I first read it, it took probably about forty hours because I clarified every word and phrase that I didn't know, and I took each rule and practiced it until I really understood and could apply it. If you do the same, your writing skills will never be the same again!
B005XN30GA|5.0|First off let me say that the waiting between episodes has now become almost painful!  I watched the pilot episode of this show on a flight i took across the country and was hooked!  As soon as i came home i searched my Roku box  for the season and began watching and lets just say i was hooked.  I turned my gf on to the show as well and the craziest part of all its as thought this show echoed our life together.  This may not make sense to you as you read but once you start watching you will understand.  We literally can wait for each week to pass!  In fact we have decided to try to hold off for a few weeks that way we can spend a sunday on the couch watching several episodes in a row to help satiate our fix!  This is a wonderful cross between fantasy and real life and the way its filmed makes it just wonderful to watch.  They are very good at transitioning between the two worlds (if you watch you will understand) and continuing the stories in a parallel way.  I dont watch a ton of TV and am even less dedicated to full seasons.  That being said this is perhaps the only show currently on TV that wait with baited breathe for the next episode to air.  This is a great show for couples even as a great show to watch at the end of the weekend or whenever for a little time together as it has a main theme of true love and romance to it.  give the pilot a chance and im sure you wont look back!

You get a cleaning cloth and a plastic squeegee, which helps, but after a lot of effort, I had a few bubbles that wouldn't move out. Mostly a cosmetic thing, iPhone works just fine. And some protection.

B006HGXGWU|2.0|When blue collar everyman Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon) experiences a series of disturbing, apocalyptic visions of a strange storm, he calmly takes precautions to save his family. In the aftermath of his visions, Curtis is haunted by his mother's schizophrenia and the real fear of losing his family due to a series of lunatic choices that backfire in the worst possible ways.<br /><br />In _Take Shelter_, writer/director Jeff Nichols has given us a Twilight Zone episode for the arthouse movie crowd. The idea of a powerful evil lurking in the small town Ohio suburbs feels ripped from a David Lynch film, and protagonist Curtis, his dedicated wife, and their deaf, 6-year-old daughter prove the perfect framing characters for the impending doom.<br /><br />Packed with career-making acting, _Take Shelter_ is a deliberate nightmare, mimicking the kind of slow-paced horror ethos found in European frightfests of the '70s and '80s. Excellent, expansive cinematography gives us not only a perfect front row seat for Curtis's descent into madness but also an in-your-face look at the stark visage of actor Michael Shannon as the nervous tics take hold. Each dream unfolds with thunder, and we are sucked into its swirling paranoia.<br /><br />Despite all the accolades for _Take Shelter_, it contains enough weaknesses so as to collapse for most viewers.<br /><br />When a film's premise and its plotline can be written in their entirety with the same dozen words, that's a depth problem. As noted, _Take Shelter_ has the feel of a Twilight Zone episode--\\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\" immediately springs to mind-- but an episode of that show ran for just under 25 minutes. This film runs 121. Though director Nichols lavishes care on every scene to the benefit of its creepiness, better editing might have trimmed this to an equally worth 100 minutes. And in the end, this is a one-note film. Anyone familiar with the aforementioned Twilight Zone episode knows the course of _Take Shelter_ within its first ten minutes. With the ending inevitable, the journey becomes more of a slog. That another 111 minutes follow might have viewers hitting their remote's fast forward button, which defeats the point of the director's attention to detail.<br /><br />Certainly, with most American films amped up on adrenaline, audiences need to learn how to appreciate a slower film. But such a film needs to deliver more than an interminable trudge to a predetermined finish. _Take Shelter_ simply doesn't deliver more than the inevitable. This is shame for such a well-made film.<br /><br />As to the DVD itself, the transfer is sharp and the sound perfect. This version of the DVD lacked frills, and I suspect all the typical extras were held back for the Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />Much to admire here. If only the payoff of _Take Shelter_ had been more distinctive.ts first ten minutes. With the ending inevitable, the journey becomes more of a slog.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book is the strangest thing I have ever read.  It could be a poster child for exactly what every woman/girl out there should avoid - every situation, every interaction, every decision made by both main characters.  Everything from unhealthy obsession, drunken brawls, living together before even knowing each other a month (let alone sleeping in the same bed), gambling, fighting, public screaming matches, jealousy to the point of hurting (physically and emotionally) others... you name the disfunction and this book exemplifies it between both main characters.  I found myself disgusted (literally grossed out) by Travis' sexual exploitations at the beginning of the book - I would NEVER hook up with a guy who had slept his way through an entire university of women.  EW!  And even though he \\"changed\\" throughout the text, which was sickeningly predictable, I couldn't get his womanizing out of my head.<br /><br />That being said - I can't say this book didn't give me butterflies on occasion.  What girl doesn't want her guy defending her, protecting her, and dropping to his knees because he's so in love with her?  Take the psychopathy, sociopathy, co-dependancy, and general narcissism out of the relationship and you have a very genuinely loving couple.  Most women I know could also get down with the whole Alpha male, she's-mine-stop-looking-at-her-or-i'll-beat-the-sh-out-of-you pretense.  A little jealousy can go a long way with me.  But Travis did NOT have a little jealousy.  He had a truckload.<br /><br />Besides the extremely disturbing relationship, the writing was... meh.  When my friend asked me how I liked the book, I said it reminded me of mozzarella - a big ole ball of cheese.  There was a scene where Travis began singing in the cafeteria that really made me throw up in my mouth a bit.  And the whole \\"Baby\\" thing that came up on occasion - barf.  And Travis was carrying her around everywhere, following her everywhere (in true stalker style), and the interactionsin the cafeteria were so Gossip Girl, I couldn't get past it.<br /><br />The ending though, I must say, I didn't see coming.  Throughout the entire thing I kept thinking that they would either kill each other or Travis would wind up in prison.  I never saw the whole marriage-at-19 thing coming.  Actually, I never saw the whole Lucky 13 back story coming either.<br /><br />The book did self proclaim as a \\"disaster\\" which truely the relationship was.  And in the end, Abby did know and even admit that she and Travis were unhealthy for each other.  So, I guess that was the whole point of the story - to step into the minds of the characters knowing the story was meant to portray this type of F-ed up relationship.  If you accept the story as intentionally trying to show a bad relationship, it's easier to root for the characters.  Sort of.
B001BKG9SK|3.0|I saw the Gdansk concert on Palladia and instantly knew I wanted this Concert for my own collection.  I already had the CD set for this but wanted the concert DVD. Boy was that a waste.  I have to say i am quite dissapointed in that the DVD is a MUCH lower resolution and more grainy than what I was expecting, NOT the same as the HD version I saw on Palladia, i guess i should have known as it was not blue-ray.  Also, and more importantly, the concert is cut up!  Many of the amazing sets are not on the DVD.  Speak to Me, Breathe, Time, Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Wish You Were Here are not even included on the Concert DVD! I would not have purchased this if I had known it was an incomplete DVD of the concert.<br /><br />I really don't see any reason to buy this in its current format.  If you want the concert just buy the CD's, the DVD's are NOT worth it.

B005TMSN4E|4.0|I participate on a few photography forums and almost everyone who gets this FT1 adapter use it for telephoto long shooting because of the outstanding 2.7x crop factor. Suddenly 200mm becomes 540mm and any longer lens you might own becomes perfect lenses for wildlife and birding.<br /><br />The V1/J1 and FT1 adapter would be perfect wildlife photography (or portraits on people) except Nikon has decided to hold back the capabilities. Yes it single center autofocuses, but I don't see why it can't have all the capabilities as the standard 1 lenses. The only reason I can figure is because Nikon is afraid of hurting their dSLR sales, but I think that's a bogus reason. Sure the 1 system has blazing fast autofocus, great metering, as good as dSLR video capabilities, but it's not going to hurt their dSLR sales because people who want the absolute best image quality will still get a dSLR. I own a D3 and it's still my go-to camera in the studio and for events, but when it comes to going out for fun and shooting (like at hikes) I want to go small and that's when I bring my V1. The FT1 gives the camera awesome telephoto options but then limits the autofocus capabilities; that really irritates me because I'm sure they went out of their way to do this!<br /><br />Imagine if they allowed all the AF abilities on the FT1. Suddenly birds could be tracked while flying! Things running towards you could be in focus all the time and all you'd have to do is hold the shutter down. The capability is there... it just needs to be unlocked by Nikon.<br /><br />While the FT1 is great and if you already own Nikon AFS lenses you owe it to yourself to try out this adapter, it's not perfect when I'm sure it's just a firmware upgrade away from being so. I really hope Nikon comes to their senses and stops limiting this adapter!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Extremely Loud, Incredibly Close is an amazing movie.  As someone who suffered the loss of a family member on 9/11 (John E. \\"Jack\\" Connolly), we can sometimes forget the others who have lost too.  More importantly, this movie reminded me that my uncle Jack left a wife and three children; all of whom are doing extremely well, despite the tragic events of 9/11.  The young man that acted in the movie did a great job.  Who knows how he was found to play this part, but I doubt they could have found a better actor for the movie.<br /><br />I would write more, but I do not want to chance spoiling this movie/book for anyone.  The book is more detailed, but the movie does it justice.  I believe this is the best drama since Good Will Hunting, and I will own this movie upon its release.  I will ensure that anyone who asks me about 9/11 and how it has effected my family, watches it.<br /><br />I encourage everyone who uttered the words, \\"We Will Not Forget\\" to watch this movie.<br /><br />Erik/New Mexico

Savored this book over a three day weekend.<br /> In our household, we have high standards when authors describe medicine and history-- this book passed the test.  Both the historian and the physician liked the rich details described in the book-- medicine, science and history.<br />Any down side?  I have to admit, it dragged a little in places- but totally forgivable in the context of a book I really enjoyed.<br />Bonus, I told the teenagers in my life- \\"This book is what Twilight could have been\\".<br />I am looking forward to the next book.
0307352145|5.0|As an investment advisor, I'm pretty unique. I don't have a sparkling personality or ability to work a crowd for business advantage. Truthfully, if I needed sales skills to feed myself, I'd have been a starvation statistic decades ago.<br /><br />Susan Cain wrote Quiet, and it's all about introverts in our society.  It's revealing and helpful and comforting to those of us so afflicted. Well, maybe afflicted isn't the right word; persecuted feels closer to the mark. From grade school to church to work, Americans seem to prize big and outgoing personalities. Cain shares the reasons why, and provides plenty of good examples to prove her point.<br /><br />The better news is that she offers other examples showing a different kind of leadership and success. It turns out that 30-50 percent of the population enjoys reading and solitude and small groups, rather than large. They tend to feel things strongly, think deeply, and contribute mightily. Still, they create from behind a quieter demeanor and sometimes go unnoticed by people around them. She names some names and it's a stellar group with outsized influence on our lives.<br /><br />It turns out that you don't have to be loud or talkative to be good.<br /><br />I've lived this bias for years. In fact, one former colleague chastised me by complaining \\"you'd rather sit at your computer writing then go out and network with people.\\"<br /><br />\\"Maybe so,\\" I answered, \\"but that's what got us to where we are today.\\" And it's so true. Little of our business comes from networking. Much of our business comes from people who have read my earlier work, or referrals from others who know about it. The substance of my ability is far more important than a loud or outgoing personality.<br /><br />That colleague is gone now, but my computer and writing continues. My business continues to grow at a remarkable pace. It turns out that clients are smart enough to see what matters and what doesn't. Small talk at a chamber of commerce mixer isn't all that important to folks with large investment portfolios.

1612130283|5.0|I picked this up after seeing the piece on the Today show discussing the controversy of the hot sex and the submissive aspects.  I think the concept that intelligent independent women shouldn't enjoy a good throw-me-down-bodice-ripper is ridiculous.  If we haven't evolved to the point where we can separate fantasy and reality it's a shame.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you this is a great piece of literature.  I don't have a clear idea of what either character looks like.  The characters are in Seattle but often use British slang (the author is British).  The terms for genitalia is obtuse, but the heroine is a virgin.  It fits.<br /><br />It is a great piece of sexy hot entertainment.  There is a huge power differential with him a rich, successful, experienced 27 yr old man (Christian), and her a just graduating 21 year old never been drunk virgin (Ana).  Their early flirting is intense with Ana and the reader never being completely sure what's going on.  His pursuit of her borders on stalker with that intensity.  He wants her, has to have her, and has the money to pursue her.  I think this (and his anger) could have blown the book except that the author has the heroine comment on it.  I think you can get away with almost anything as long as the reader knows that the author is aware of what they're doing.  She has Ana tease him about being a stalker and his responses make it hot.  Christian is the perfect damaged hero that really has a heart and longs to be saved, only he doesn't know it.  From the moment she uses his first name, which he doesn't allow many to do, she starts to melt him.  He starts to fall for this flirty naive woman and long to be what she needs instead of having this contracted dom/sub relationship where he's in control.  Watching him slip in and out of that is fascinating.  The BDSM aspect is lite.  It was more about the negotiating and Ana negotiated what she wanted and didn't just let him have his way.  She didn't put up with his crap, so Idon't quite understand the hub-bub about it being a man controlling a woman.  She is the one who really has the control.  Their emails which are initially the only way they can open up to one another are hilarious if only for the subject and signature lines.<br /><br />The sex.  Well . . . speaking for myself the whole virgin/teacher thing is scorching hot.  The way he commands her in the bedroom, but makes sure she's well taken care of was steamy.  I guarentee that couples everywhere are recreating the last sex scene in the playroom.<br /><br />The angst of them falling in love yet being terrified completely yanked my heart.<br /><br />If you want Tess of the D'urberville's don't read this.  If you want a hot read that will make you laugh, cry, squirm, and sweat grab this fast.

B005LAIGYQ|4.0|And to think, back in the day, I thought 1990's NAVY SEALS was the authentic shizzy. NAVY SEALS doesn't hold a candle to ACT OF VALOR. Charlie Sheen would soil himself if thrown in the company of this film's tough as nails cast, a significant chunk of which is comprised of real life active duty U.S. Navy SEALs (whose names, by the way, are left off the credits). ACT OF VALOR is neither as ferociously right wing nor as jingoistic as I've been led to believe. Yes, there are moments which very well may invoke your bump of patriotism. But, mostly, it's a thrilling, well-crafted war picture. It may even recruit a whole new mess of squids.<br /><br />Roselyn S&aacute;nchez is the only recognizable name here. She plays a CIA operative who is abducted while working undercover in Costa Rica. When SEAL Team 7 is deployed on an extraction mission, a terrorist plot concerning multiple attacks on U.S. soil is unearthed.<br /><br />There's no doubting that this cast of Navy Seals is accomplished on many, many fronts. But, understandably, their acting skills aren't so squared away. Still, there's something inherently likable about these elite frogmen, and it's not just because these men are genuine heroes who put their lives on the line every day to protect our butts. The film focuses most on two Seals - Lt. Rorke, who is an expecting father for the first time, and his best friend, a USN Chief who also serves as the (sometimes awkward) voiceover narrator. If there's a closet actor hiding in this bunch of rookie actors, it's the guy who plays the Senior Chief. Of everyone, he flaunts the most personality. One of my favorite scenes has him conducting an interrogation onboard a smuggler's yacht. I love it that he swings down onto the yacht, removes his military gear, and reveals a suit and tie underneath. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />I found it easy enough to overlook the sometimes wooden performances, found it easy to admire their earnestness. All those bonding moments early on - as the Seals and their families gather at the beach just before a black ops - may seem corny and trite, but it cements in my mind how close the team members are and just how much they depend on each other. It's particularly telling that the Chief would advise the others to make sure to straighten out their personal affairs before they all head \\"downrange.\\" Carrying personal baggage into the field of engagement is one sure way to compromise the mission and the men.<br /><br />There are no hotshots on SEAL Team 7, no cocky Charlie Sheens. What they lack in things thespian-y, they more than compensate for with the authenticity they stamp on the screen. These cats move a certain way, behave a certain way. They handle their weaponry with a familiarity born out of hard-earned experience. When the film arrives at those moments fraught with warfare, they look extremely competent and professional. The combat sequences are intense and, at times, visceral. This isn't a documentary, but it at times captures the feel of one. I'm cribbing a quote here: \\"ACT OF VALOR is a field manual on current weapons and tactics, a primer on the whys of acts of terrorism, and how SEAL teams and other units are prepared to protect America and Americans from such fanaticism.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite poems is Rudyard Kipling's \\"If.\\" But Shawnee Chief Tecumseh's poem - which is read outloud in the film - is equally as stirring. Both Tecumseh and Kipling have crafted codes of conduct that we all should honor and live by. But when folks choose to ignore their words, at least we've got our boys downrange covering our backs.

I also think Liam Neeson is a good actor and had much more hope for this than what I got.<br /><br />My main problem with this movie is not the story and not the men, but how the wolves are portraited. I know enough about wolves to know they don't behave like these. I didn't read any reviews or synopses before seeing it and after a while I was wondering if it was some kind of werewolf-movie or perhaps a prehistoric beast up there in Alaska! A different apporach regarding wolves and other threats out in the wilderness would have made it a lot better in my opinion.

0792757858|4.0|The three stories collected here deal with the nature of good and evil in man's soul.  Stevenson's views are clearly influenced by his Christianity, and some of them seem implausible from a more modern, scientific standpoint, but there is still much of value to be gleaned from these stories.<br /><br />\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is about an upstanding, respectable doctor who has a darker side which he guiltily hides from society, until through his experiments he severs in himself \\"those provinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature.\\"  This view of man's nature, as well as the natures of good and evil, is rather mystical, even Platonic, and not particularly insightful...but Stevenson has other things to say on those subjects which are.  For instance, this story also explores the theme of how giving in to minor vices corrupts one's character, leading the way to greater evils and making it ever harder to remain on the path of righteousness.<br /><br />---<br /><br />\\"The Body Snatcher\\" is the least interesting story of the three, about corpses for dissection by medical students being provided by increasingly foul means.  It deals with some similar themes to \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", such as that acts of evil that would seem impossible to one at first may be reached by gradual steps, and that once the first step is taken it becomes increasingly more difficult to turn back until the end result becomes inevitable.<br /><br />---<br /><br />In some ways the most interesting of the three stories, \\"Olalla\\" is about a young man who falls in love with a woman with a terrible secret in her family.  In some passages, Stevenson seems to reject the dual nature he portrayed in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\": \\"the soul and the body are one, and mostly so in love.  What the body chooses, the soul loves; where the body clings, the soul cleaves; body for body, soul to soul, they come together at God's signal; and the lower part (if we can call aught low) is only the footstool and foundation of the highest.\\"<br /><br />By the end, however, he explicitly rejects this view in favor of the Christian doctrine of Original Sin: \\"behold the face of the Man of Sorrows.  We are all such as He was---the inheritors of sin; we must all bear and expiate a past which was not ours; there is in all of us---ay, even in me---a sparkle of the divine.  Like Him, we must endure for a little while, until morning returns bringing peace\\"---and speaks of \\"sad and noble truths; that pleasure is not an end, but an accident; that pain is the choice of the magnanimous; that it is best to suffer all things and do well.\\"<br /><br />I don't have much sympathy for this view of life, but Stevenson's artistic presentation of it is good and I enjoyed these stories.  They are well-written and thought-provoking, and pack a lot of punch for their short lengths, which is more than you can say for a lot of fiction these days.  So, not my favorites (not even my favorites by Stevenson---I prefer his adventure stories, such as Treasure Island and Kidnapped), but worth reading.

B003GK2216|4.0|Great review of a period in time in social structure/behaviour/hardships......we often beleive things were good in the olden days. No ways! Development of the themes and characters over time was good.....but tailed off at the end. A BIG book!

B0070Z97LG|4.0|I know other reviewers said the trailer spoiled the movie but it was still good inspite of the that. Anything that can hold your attention is worth watching and this movie did just that.  LOVED IT!!  It was a good thriller that had me thinking one thing, when it was another.  For me it did not disappoint because it was an up and down suspenseful movie filled  with a little action at the end, as each character was unwinding in front of your eyes and playing off of each other. Ultimatly, I was still surprised at the ending; who did what and why. Good Watch.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|wow, what an awesome book, I haven't seen the movie, but I really enjoyed reading Joey's story, loved the way 'he' described his people and life
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is one thing that I am very glad to have ordered. Although when I had opened the package the sonic 'head' (if you will..) had quite some small blemishes to it. Overall it's pretty good... shipped fast, and is as described. I have no complaints about it as of now. I honestly hope it stays that way. I have been told by my little brother that I'm annoying with all my \\"Don't lose the pen piece...\\" and now he tells me that when I just touch it. Pretty fun in the end.<br />I only gave the durability 3 stars because I tend to be clumsy and drop this all the time... I have yet to find out if it's as durable as some say.

0312576463|4.0|This is very nice piece of writing. Although the book is rather long, one does not tire of its vivid descriptions and character development. It centers on the relationship between three rather unusual and powerful figures, a woman, her husband, and her lover who is also her husband's best friend. The love scenes are powerful and, as usual with Jonathan Franzen, quite explicit. The intensity of some of the love making scenes is a bit hard to take seriously but I guess they do exist at least in Franzen's mind. If you enjoy erotica, there is plenty here to feast on. The power of the relationships in this book are exceptional. The other characters in the book, the children of the married couple, the husband's lover and others are fairly well drawn. Some of the events described do seem rather unlikely, especially the final project which Walter embarks on.<br /><br />  Underlying the vivid love stories are political issues that are dealt with in a way that draws the reader in as well. This is also a morality play with political issues weaving their way through the interactions between the main characters. The book was well worth the reading although it was not as gripping as some other books I have recently read. I think the reader will enjoy this latest Franzen undertaking. I found the pace toward the end more to my liking than the earlier part of the book.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Child has created an interesting character without actually being a good writer. The heart within Reacher novels is pure pulp and reading one of his stories is like watching network TV except for the complete lack of moral ambiguity. There's nothing beneath the surface, but then, that's often true of the genre. Nothing crosses the blood brain barrier. Still, I've enjoyed many of the series as light entertainment when I want to tune out the day. Some are better than others and a few are terrible.<br /><br />The Affair is one of the better ones, particularly if you've read all or a lot of the others. It provides a background for what Reacher has become and it keeps you moving along trying to figure out what is really happening.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I play a lot of adventure games, usually on the PC. This game definitely held its own to be an app. It was challenging, but not impossible. I admit I had to Google the flower box puzzle. The only thing I would have liked to have seen in this game would be some hidden object scenes.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Really enjoyed this game, I just wish it were longer so I can enjoy it even more!  I would recommend buying this game to anyone who likes a good mystery.

B002361MLA|4.0|I'm not usually into these enlightenment type of books, but this book held my attention. I'm not a confused person or anything like that. Just an interesting book. For some people, I can see it being a breakthrough. Not so much for me.
B006QPVGKG|3.0|It was another hyped movie that showed all the good stuff in the previews.  This was a movie that should be rented so it goes away and you never have to see it again.  Was not scary and the scary part was they actually had it on the big screen first.

B0059XTUMC|4.0|\\"The Artist\\" is a French romantic comedy drama genre film set during the transition period of silent to speaking films from 1927 - 1932, in Hollywood.<br /><br />George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a star of the silent film industry, and during a fan and media appearance at a movie premier screening, chemistry is established almost instantly between he and Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), which is a meeting by chance.<br /><br />Valentin's career seems to only be limited by the sky, yet his unwillingness to shift into speaking films paves the way for Miller to cement herself as an actress, having again dazzled Valentin as a dancer in one of his last silent works.<br /><br />Like so many actors who assume that their name brand can flourish without the studios Valentin makes his own film, which is far overshadowed by Miller's new stardom and movie premiering on the same day as his.<br /><br />The story of Valentin's decline is the essence of the film narrative, and it is a valuable reminder of how quickly fame can evaporate.<br /><br />The cinematography captures the era with authenticity by utilising great costume and set design.<br /><br />As a silent film the emotions of the characters and their progression is conveyed richly with quality acting and a well constructed story.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B0052U59F4|4.0|I like this book and the story but as a writer if you're going to set your plot in the US and have American characters do the research and make sure you're not having those characters use British terms and speech patterns. I know the author is British but she should have made sure they don't sound lie they're from England.  It happens enough to be annoying. Otherwise I like it!
B004TTZHBK|2.0|the app is very doesn't have a large selection of recipes! which sucks, there are around two recipes for salmon--really Jamie? there is no recipe for orzo. all in all this app should have been free.
0061122416|1.0|I'm incredulous that this book has garnered so many rave reviews.  The repetitive, childish writing style was annoying.  The hodgepodge of superstition comprised of God, Allah, omens, visions, spirits of good and evil, and vibrations of peace covered all bases, one of which was always on hand to provide a deus ex machina when the plot required one.  When the protagonist meets a young woman on his journey, he falls in love with her--before they've even spoken.  \\"At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him.\\"  The book is filled with such cliches.  I wonder how few stars this book would have gotten if it had been reviewed by all those who were so bored by it that they threw it aside after the first chapter.  Please, don't let yourself be pressured into wasting your time on this book; your \\"Personal Legend\\" can be found elsewhere.
0062082353|5.0|Kyle is a true American hero that served and sacrificed for his country. Highly recommend this book!! I read \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell prior to reading this book. Both books are spectacular personal accounts of the sacrifices and struggles that these American hero's go through for Country and their fellow brothers in arms. I really liked how Kyle's wife's sacrifices at home are detailed throughout the book. It gives the reader an often overlooked glimpse into the hardships war has on marriage and family.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I love this book! I just downloaded the final book in the trilogy, and I can't wait to start reading it!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This book is not a 'how to guide' on getting your book published, and the first half of the book is easy to skim.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />The book explains how to position yourself in a flooded market and how to really connect with potential customers. There's a lot of great advice on successfully using your social platform. If I learn one new thing from a guide then it's worth it - I picked up a few tips I hadn't considered and one key ingredient that will be added to my regime. It's an honest and refreshing approach.
006197806X|1.0|How many times can a person get captured and escape?  Apparently there is no limit in this book.  That is what happens in this book.  Lena gets captures, she escapes. Lena gets captures, she escapes. Lena gets captures, she escapes. And so on.  She ends-up falling for this new guy Julian.  When is all said and done Lena learn a little bit more about her mom, Alex shows up at the end as Julian and Lena kiss ... blah blah blah.  people are comparing this to the Hunger Games, I just don't see it.  This compares more to the \\"Matched\\" Trilogy by Ally Condie  or the \\"Maze Runner\\" Trilogy by James Dashner.<br /><br />Chekcout the \\"Uglies\\" from Scott Westerfeld, even though is not a trilogy but four books it is also a story about a dystopian society.  And let's not forget Divergent by Veronica Roth.  I hope her second book in her trilogy does not flop like Oliver's.<br /><br />Some authors of trilogies have the tragedy of filling the second book in its trilogy with \\"transitional stuff.\\" A bread come of this, a breadcrumb of that and an attempt to a choking cliffhanger to get you to buy the last installment.  I will wait and see if Oliver redeems herself with the last book in this deliriously dizzy trilogy.

B004M8KLYQ|5.0|An incredibly thoughtful and moving LP dealing with War. She does this with incredible delicateness and care and this makes it extremely moving. Hard to describe in words but it is there in the music and lyrics.  You have to let it wash over you and soak in. As a musically inclined individual it is just pure genius on musical and spiritual level.

B0064BWE8U|4.0|While I have enjoyed this and other Kinsella books, I am pleased to say that I delved right into the story, without having to endure a lull in the plot. What I could have done without were the footnotes and Poppy's penchant for subscribing Sam to a myriad of events, which seemed a little far-fetched (but maybe that's just me).<br /><br />In addition to Sophie Kinsella's books, I have come across another well-deserving chic-lit feast called Made in Manhattan. It offers a fresh take on chic-lit and its protagonist, like Poppy in this book, is likeable, if not at times incorrigible.
B006FE83V8|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird remains my all-time favorite movie and this new restoration for it's 50th anniversary is amazing, Universal has done a really good job restoring this black and white classic and it looks better than ever! Gregory Peck's performance is unique and really powerful! Any fan of this movie needs to add this to their collection!
031617615X|2.0|This book series isn't really that bad. Obviously it is for teen girls, so my expectations on depth and plot were not high. However, I felt that the ending was a complete letdown. *SPOILERS on how it doesn't end* The entire series built up the Edward/Bella relationship like it was a strong addict getting her fix. There was no real development of them other than their unbreakable connection.<br /><br />With Jacob on the other hand, a more human romance was created. Edward was obsessive and creepy (stalker), and the relationship was dysfunctional. Jacob was sweet and though hot tempered, really cared for Bella's well being. Bella, just wanted to go to bed with Edward at any cost.<br /><br />Throughout, I kept thinking of the spell that vampires put over their prey in other stories. That somehow Edwards has created a mental connection with Bella that forces her to \\"love\\" him (considering his mental abilities), perhaps that he himself doesn't see. HIS primary attraction being that he can't read her, and HER attraction being that she is psychically drugged.<br /><br />That is what I had hoped for the last book. That eventually Bella would become a vampire, and realize that her love was simply a spell. Once turned, she would lose the connection and become lost in a world she never really wanted to join. Jacob would be gone, the one she really loved as a human (but couldn't see it because of the addiction). A real tragedy that would send a good moral message to teen girls about love and obsessive behavior, and the consequences of not truly finding yourself (being lost in a \\"boy\\").<br /><br />Alas, the sappy happy \\"ever-after\\" ending disappointed me.
B006UG90RM|1.0|One gets the feeling while listening to this drivel that the Van Halen brothers wanted to prove to the world that David Lee Roth cannot sing anymore. Well, they proved their point!
0439023483|1.0|Perhaps I have read too much, perhaps my taste is vastly different from the rest...but these books were flat and boring. The only reason I finished them is because I have a dire need to complete everything I start. The characters were flat, they did not interact well, and making a girl a war propaganda was pretty lame. There was no touching of the heart or soul from these books. So perhaps I read for something more. I like to connect to the characters in the stories I read, and not even Katniss was an in depth enough character to connect to. She was filled with anger but you never saw it come out of her. The only time I saw a real human reaction was when she was depressed over the death of her sister. I felt robbed actually, of my time. All I thought about was the story \\"The Lottery\\" and a series called The Uglies. Also,the point of the story was lost somewhere because of the amount of focus on the piddly details such as the romance that was false. I am sorry...but these stories are flat, uninteresting, and lack connectivity. I do not recommend them to someone who really enjoys reading as a past time, someone who has read more than the pop culture novels of our time, because that is definitely what this stuff is. Read some real stuff for once instead of wasting your time on a drab, completely flat boring series that seems to mimic a lot of other stories that are much better.

B0060ZJ78U|5.0|This is a very wonderful film.  Having bought the book when it was originally released in 2003, I wondered how well the adaptation would go to the big screen.<br /><br />I found out right away:  I liked it immediately.<br /><br />Brad Pitt shines as A's general manager Billy Beane.  While dealing with the realities facing the 2002 team, he also reaches back into his past, where he was arguably the most talented high school prospect in America coming out of high school--only to fail to pan out as a big league player.  Yet, as a general manger, he has clearly made his mark, as the A's, on his watch, went on to be a serious contender at the turn-of-the-century, contending for the World Series for nearly a decade.  Despite the team's recent struggles, Mr. Beane has never stopped trying to field a competitive team in light of the team's meager payroll, aged stadium, media market, etc.  Mr. Brad has come a long way as an actor and really showed me a lot in this role.<br /><br />Another person who showed me a lot is Jonah Hill, who earned his Oscar nomination, amongst the many this film received and earned in addition, as A's assistant GM Peter Brand, who is based in part on Paul DePodesta, who actually held the position with the A's at the time.  Brand really brought a lot to his role as the assistant who helped opened Mr. Beane's--and baseball's--eyes and minds to the possibilities of saber metrics as a way and means of evaluating player talent as opposed to the time-and-true conventional methods of player evaluation and talent.  It is very hard to believe that one of the more foremost younger comedians in entertainment today would make this role so dramatically believable, but Jonah pulls this off with quiet passion and aplomb.<br /><br />Even Phillip Seymour Hoffman does well as Art Howe, who was in what would be his final year as A's manager.  He is able to convey the frustrations he feels with a team he is handed to manage and keep together given all he is able to work with by the team's GM.  Even more understated by Mr. Hoffman's standards, the less-is-more approach for Howe plays well here.<br /><br />I like the way this film unfolds.  Using some key players from this team as actual characters, namely David Justice, Scott Hatteberg, Miguel Tejada, John Mabry and Chad Bradford, amongst others, the season blends into one of curiosity and hopefulness in hoping the A's are able to work this plan of theirs out.  The film also blends actual game footage into the mix as well, using actual A's broadcasters of the time--and even now--throughout the game portions of the film.  Though knowing how the film will end, for those who followed the team as I did back in 2002, even bringing back such sweet memories, the journey is one which never grows old, tired, repetitive or boring.  This is a movie which begs to be seen--and can be seen again.  The Blu-ray Disc presentation is a solid one, with a fine, clear 1080p picture and a very strong DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack.  Even the extras are worth viewing in comparing some of the actual characters vs. their film counterparts.<br /><br />This move hits a home run!!!!  No, it hits a grand slam!!!!  Go see this movie!!!!!!  Buy it for your collection--regardless of whether you are a baseball fan, a fan of good movies--or just both!!!!!rk with by the team's GM.

B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|Imagine yourself being pursued by all manner of for-profit and government assassins. What do you do? Who can you trust? Can you trust anyone? And is it still possible to make this interesting?<br /><br />  Mallory Kane (played by Gina Carano) is a former Marine employed by a private contractor to deal with clandestine issues of national security for the United States government. When we first see her she is in a diner in a remote area by herself when, moments later, a former coworker by the name of Aaron (played by Channing Tatum) asks her to come with him back to their employer and assaults her when she refuses. Aaron (Tatum) has the upper-hand until a patron in the diner comes to Mallory's aid and this allows Mallory to injure and incapacitate Aaron and escape with said patron, Scott (played by Michael Angarano) in his car. Worried this might be her only chance and looking for any help she can get, Mallory recounts the events that resulted in her being on the run to Scott (Angarano) while he mends her injuries from her encounter with Aaron and she drives. Meanwhile, Mallory's employer and former boyfriend (for lack of a better word) Kenneth (played by Ewan McGregor) is making plans to contain the situation and the inevitable blowback that will result.<br /><br />  Though I didn't know it going in, Carano's voice was dubbed over in the film. Having heard her voice since seeing the movie, I'm not sure of the motivation. Usually the motive for dubbing is inferior acting, inability to speak the language, or incompatibility between the character and the voice of the actor portraying them. I can only assume that she fell short as an actress but it doesn't show onscreen. The music chosen by and work of director Steven Soderbergh in addition to the fight scenes are all top-notch. Surprisingly so, as Channing Tatum has not made one film up to this point that I've watched without regretting it later. Great movie.

B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Is there progress to be made in depicting the war on terror in film? What if you depict events in that war starring the brave individuals who are actually fighting it? Crazy, right? But crazy enough to work?<br /><br />  The film opens with voice-over of a man reading the always heart-wrenching last letter. Later we're introduced to two CIA operatives deep inside an organization with ties to terrorists. Lisa Morales (played by Roselyn Sanchez) and Walter Ross (played by Nestor Serrano) are acting as aid workers in a small town in Mexico while investigating the town's benefactor, commonly referred to as Christo. Christo (played by Alex Veadov) is a smuggler with ties to a Muslim extremist by the name of Abu Shabal (played by Jason Cottle). When Morales and Ross (Sanchez and Serrano) are discovered, Ross is killed and Morales is kidnapped and held hostage so that she can be tortured for information. Once those in authority discover signs of a struggle in Morales' residence, a crew of Navy SEALs is called in to perform a rescue mission. Revealing any additional details would give away too much of the story.<br /><br />  Now, having only seen the film once, character names and story arcs are kind of a blur. Also, as the names of the lead \\"actors\\" in this film are being withheld for security reasons, any praise or criticism of any particular cast member is pointless. Of course, these men are not actors. Then again, I've seen plenty of highly-paid actors star in films that weren't half as interesting. Every action scene was a thrill a minute and those moments in-between were a welcomed relief. I urge all of-age action fans to see this movie at their earliest possible convenience.
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|This film is an example of film making by and for idiots. Why?<br />1. The creature doesn't morph into efficient shapes. It uses faces because the director thinks it's scary, that's all.<br />2. Why do scientific expeditions have flame throwers, grenades and pistols? Because the film needed them.<br />3. Does anyone really believe an alien would bite a grenade or that a single grenade would destroy an alien star ship?<br />4. The dialog and scenes are sloppy and confused. Where did everybody go? Do you care?<br />5. Why must all SF films be made by and for idiots? Because Hollywood is run by them and they think we're idiots too.<br />BOYCOT HOLLYWOOD SCHLOCKFESTS!

But being so engrossed in a book is what I live for - and these all did it!  I thought the characters were very colorful and not at all \\"flat\\", as some have commented. I like being surprised and not able to predict where a story is leading.  I was constantly surprised with all three of these books.  There's a reason The Hunger Games is a phenomenon; don't miss out on this engaging experience.  I'm so bummed there are only three books - and I pray the movies do them justice.  Amazing read!

B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is quite possibly THE best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. No matter what else Colin Firth does for the rest of his illustrious career, he will always be the perfect Mr. Darcy. I cannot recommend this enough to people. Buy it now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. Spent hours playing it lots of fun and kid friendly. my son loves playing it too. worth trying out.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is a fantastic read for both children and adults. I would recommend it for 12 and up, depending on your child's reading comfort level. The story is engaging and engrossing. It is not a terribly challenging read, and can be finished in less than one day. The moral of the story is great, and the ending leaves room for the imagination to take over. Highly recommended!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I got this because I love Doctor Who.  It's fun to play with, especially if you like writing things in invisible ink.  The only real thin I have a problem with is that the one I got has a very low volume.  I don't know if this by design or if it just a fluke with mine.  Otherwise, I am completely pleased with it!  I gave it a four star rating only because of the volume.  It's otherwise great!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book.  I loved it from cover to cover.  To those who critize it's \\"lack of a moral\\" - you just don't get it.  I'm definately giving this book to my teenage grandkids.  The entire point of this book is about sacrificing one's self and about appreciating what we have today because our world could change.  I want my kids to understand and be grateful for the very food on the table.  I loved it and I know my grandchildren will too.  I finished reading this book at 1 a.m. and immediately downloaded the next one on my Kindle Fire and started reading!
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|This zip sleeve is too small.  The stylus will not fit in, nor will a screen cleaning cloth.  Waste of money as I had to buy another cover.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then....okay, we all know where that goes. However, if it looks like a Canon ion battery, and sells for a lot less, there's a pretty good chance it's NOT a Canon battery. Bottom line?  Canon quality comes with a price tag and you don't want to skimp when it comes to batteries. I've used nothing but verified Canon batteries in my Canon EOS 40D, and I've never been disappointed.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I enjoy watching \\"Castle\\" on television and I can almost hear the dialogue as I read it. Who ever writes these stories is very clever and has a good way of portraying the scene as you read it.  To me it was very enjoyable to read and I also bought the other two books by the same author.  I look forward to some future books by him.  Thanks for a good read!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Like all of Grisham's books, this one moved along at a great pace.  There was really very little action, few plot twists and basically a simple story.  I enjoyed reading it, but it was just o.k.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|If you are careful how you tap on things, you will never spend a penny on this game unless you want to. Its fun, enjoyable and easy to get the hang of. I play all of their games, including farm, bakery and fashion. All of them are under the ID hiimbriana. Yay TeamLava!
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun game but much slower than my iphone. games are not as difficult but great to waste time. I would recommend this game.
B004LWZW4W|1.0|Watched this movie again and still cannot figure out the high ratings. Even with the suspension of disbelieve requried with all movies this is film still has a terrible finish. CGI is good but the finale still makes the movie feel like a low budget B movie. It's so hokey and 1970's type of BS I can't believe it! Very unimpressive! James Franco still gives the same unemotional an wooden performance he's famous for. This may have been his most emotional performance but that's not saying much. He had more emotion and fun in Your Highness than he did in this waste of time. Sorry for those of you who think I've never seen a movie but movies are one of my passions along with reading good books. I've seen thousands of movies. I can usually find something positive in all of them. Turner Classic Movies is one of my favorite channels. Unfortunately this movie still disappoints on all fronts. It starts out great but the last-45-60 minutes of of the movie destroy what could have been a masterpiece. I suspect most reviews are giving this film such a high rating for the first half hour of the film and totally ignoring the last half/two thirds of the film. Still a terrible ending! The action at the end is just terrible!! Makes an A list movie into a low class B-list movie. Still not very good. Too bad people are so influenced by CGI instead of good plots and good execution by quality actors. This is an example of a typically over-hyped, over advertised film that didn't make it at the box office (because it's not very good) so the movie company pushed DVD sales by creating a lot of positive ratings on Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure what the five star reviewers saw in this movie. The first part of the movie had some promise with some good character developement. Definately had some potential but did not follow thru. The last half of the movie is far too unrealistic and ruins the movie. Where is th US Military when the apes break out? Don't you think at least the Natiional Guard with automatic weapons would have been called out after the damage the apes did? Even without the military how could all the automatic weapons the police had miss the unarmed chimps?In the real world the unarmed apes would have been cut to pieces no matter how smart they are. Do you really think a hundred hunted apes could really take over 750 million humans, even if they are as smart as we are?  They would have to breed litters of 100 plus offspring for a thousand years just to match the population assuming humans continued to have children. Far too many hunters with top notch weapons for this to happen no matter how smart the apes become.  Also, it looked like a major California city so why only one helicoptor with no real weapons? Come on, one guy with a hand held automatic weapon in the helicoptor and it's taken out by a jumping gorilla? Pathetic! Once again in the real world a helicoptor with machine gun would cut the unarmed opponents to shreds. Those that escaped would be hunted unmercifully. Too few apes and too many US citizens with guns to hunt the apes down to make this movie even close to realistic. No matter how smart the apes (and the couldn't have been too smart since the couldn't figure out how to use guns) this movie sucked. No matter how smart the apes, pure numbers ensure their destruction.  I can suspend disbelief but this movie tried to carry it way too far. The script started to develope empathy for some of the characters at the beginning of the film but lost it by the end. Only recommendation I can give this film is some decent special effects and a great performance by John Lithgow.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101+ Is the coolest set of games I've come across since I started playing Multics game sets. I have already told friends to play it. Keep up the games.
B001F3FUK6|1.0|I'm laughing at all the positive reviews on this movie< I've heard that some of the plot is explained in the deleted scenes, my response is this. Superman would never leave earth without telling Lois, Two. If this movie really took place after the Richard Lester Superman II, he broke his promise. Because before he flew off the roof of the white house, he informed the president he wouldn't let us down again. But yet in this movie, he just leaves, and appearently leaves Lois with a kid, which is his. OOps did I spoil anything, I agree with some of the other reviews, this movies acts like it's ashamed to be a Comic book movie, and tries to be serious. While Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the X-Men movies, he clearly shows he has no idea how to handle Superman, it was a rehash of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie. And for those who just let this movie get by with a pass, shame on you, This movie's idiocy was shoved into one scene. The infamous krypton island scene, now people have tried to explain it away, but you can't really fix bad scriptwriting, particularly when you establish rules in a movie. You can't just abandon them five minutes later in the movie, now when Superman lands on the island. He immediately loses his powers, gets beat up by Luthor's henchmen, then gets shived, but after Lois rescues him. He flies into the sun, recharges. And flies back to the island, but flies under it. Now here's where the problem arrives, Superman is protected from Kryptonite by wearing LEAD. NOT MUD, and he still has his powers, even after he's flying the island into space and his protection is falling away leaving him exposed to the Kryptonite, is he effected, Naw. Now once he tosses it into space, we get a drama scene, by the way. This movie is full of them, anyway he falls back to earth. This movie, much like \\"The Dark Knight\\" was not a comic book movie, it was trying to be serious. IT\\"S A SUPERMAN MOVIE, this movie isn't
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The trilogy is ok. It can get you entertained for the first time you read it but it's not a book that would make you want to read more than once.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I read this book a few months after I read \\" To the Limit: An Air Cav Huey Pilot in Vietnam\\".<br />The author of \\"Chickenhawk\\" gives a very personal perspective on the Vietnam War, as he describes the art of flying from one hand, and his thoughts and concern of his (and his mates) safety in the other hand.<br />Robert Mason in his book is \\"all over the place\\" in \\"good meaning\\" which is, that as a reader you can understand his difficulties as a pilot and as a (disturbed) man.<br />It is a great book, and you really \\"feel\\" for Mr. Mason as the war really changed his life and NOT for the good.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The kindle version is great. No problem in that matter and the book is awesome. You can't just get enough. At the end you want to read the next. This collection is terrific. 100% reccomendable in all senses

Oh btw...i also purchased the 3rd book MockingJay in advance...im sure i will be reading it by tomorrow evening...haha
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Personally I thought the hunger games was awesome. It had action ,romance ,surprises,I highly recommend the hunger games what I loved about the book it that every single chapter you read hooks you.After I read it I couldn't wait to get my hands on catching fire because it was that good.
B003Y5H556|5.0|This is a stylish horror story, a who-done-it mystery, and a young love romance combined.  Dark, gothic, and visually gorgeous in parts, it's an entertaining movie that carries you along and keeps you guessing.<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried grows ever more beautiful in her movies, coming a long way from her dim-wit over-rouged Karen in \\"Mean Girls\\" in this leading role.<br /><br />Shiloh Fernandez does a good job, looking very much like a younger, less crazy Joaquin Phoenix.  Max Irons (the son of Jeremy Irons) is another teen heart throb in the making.<br /><br />Also interesting to see on screen again are Julie Christie and Virgina Madsen, screen beauties in their younger years, playing a hippie grandmother and philandering mother.<br /><br />Lukas Haas, the little boy from \\"Witness\\" is in this movie, all growed up, as a naive Father Auguste.  He had a small part in \\"Inception\\" also.<br /><br />Gary Oldman was great, as always, playing the role of Father Solomon.<br /><br />The music adds to this movie, very new age and pretty.  I got the soundtrack afterwards.<br /><br />It's not the usual movie treatment of the Middle Ages. I was glad they finally ditched the standard fake British accents and went with American accents for once.  After all, people didn't speak with either modern British or American accents in the Middle Ages.<br /><br />Father Solomon's African and Asian soldiers add to the effect that this is very much a modern fantasy tale - like a graphic novel, a re-telling of ancient times as seen through a parallel universe.<br /><br />All the negative reviews of this movie miss the fantasy and graphic novel style of this movie, miss the fact that this is not the usual gross-out teen horror movie, but very much a warm and gentle romance between two young and attractive leads.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot, enough to get the Blu-ray and DVD combo after renting it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a good number of extras not in the DVD, including an alternate ending (shorter and more abrupt than the theatrical cut), a gag reel of bloopers, a few deleted scenes, and several \\"making of\\" shorts about the actors, music, and film making.<br /><br />The best two extras for fans of this movie are the music video of the song \\"Crystal Visions\\" (shot as an extended version of the future love affair seen in glimpses at the end of the movie) and a Picture-in Picture commentary track with Director Catherine Hardwicke, Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fermandez, and Max Irons talking about the movie.  One brief exchange:<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried: \\"Do you ever think when you watch me, that it's quite possible for my eyeballs to fall out?\\"<br />Max Irons: \\"Best question ever.\\"<br />Catherine Hardwicke: \\"You do have pretty amazingly large eyes\\".<br />Amanda Seyfried: \\"Sometime it makes me want to just close them\\".nding (shorter and more abrupt than the theatrical cut), a gag reel of bloopers, a few deleted scenes, and several \\"making of\\" shorts about the actors, music, and film making.<br /><br />The best two extras for fans of this movie are the music video of the song \\"Crystal Visions\\" (shot as an extended version of the future love affair seen in glimpses at the end of the movie) and a Picture-in Picture commentary track with Director Catherine Hardwicke, Amanda Seyfried, Shiloh Fermandez, and Max Irons talking about the movie.

B0067LXQAW|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this album.  It is not edgy, as others have stated, but it is definite Cranberries.  When the Cranberries were more edgy I was in my younger spirited time of my life in college.  Now with young children and a little more experience on life I can relate to more music found in this album.  Just understand this album may not be that edgy Cranberries album you are looking for from the past.  Unlike other groups in the past that came back together to do another album just to make an absolute mess and not \\"sound\\" like themselves....this is definite Cranberries.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|Summary:<br />Anastasia Steele has graduated and takes a job with a publishing house. She's trying to move on from her break-up with Christian, but can't seem to get him off of her mind. Meanwhile, Christian is determined to get Ana back and is willing to go to extreme lengths to make it happen. As he battles with his dark past, he proposes a new arrangement to Ana. She can't resist him and their steamy and complicated relationship continues. While Ana and Christian try to re-establish their relationship, women from Christian's past keep interfering. Once again, Ana debates on whether or not their love for each other can make it through another battle.<br /><br />My Take:<br />Once again I say, there aren't enough words. I adore this series! E.L. James continues sharing Ana and Christian's love story in a beautiful and explosive way. This part of the journey shows us the consequences of Christian's past lifestyle. While you still see the steamy love scenes, they settle into real life. When a couple moves into everyday reality, things can often change.<br /><br />Christian and his stubborn, overbearing ways, feels that he needs to continue to guide and protect Ana's decisions. Meanwhile, Ana needs a bit of independence and feels that she needs to establish her place in the world separate from her life with Christian. Of course there are dramatic events that take place that rock their world. I think that is the only negative thing I have to say about this part of the story. I could have done without such a drastic event taking place, but after reading the final book, I feel better about how the situation was handled.<br /><br />Please go get this series! It's an all-time favorite of mine and definite re-read!!! J'adore my Christian Grey! He haunts my thoughts (in a delicious way)!<br />[...]
B004132HZS|5.0|I bought the Sherlock Holmes Season One 2 disc set for my husband for Christmas.  He is a MAJOR Sherlock Holmes fan and has the whole Jeremy Brett set by Granada.  I wasn't sure that he would even like this version of Sherlock in the 21st Century, but he LOVES it!<br /><br />He has watched the three epidsodes over and over and over again.  So often that I can't sit and watch them any more with him.  He loves this 21st Century version as much as all of the others and is anxiously awaiting Season Two.

B0046IGOIO|5.0|I was a big Doors fan at the time and this is one of the few concerts I didn't get wasted at - probably because everyone was expecting something outrageous from Morrison (yes, at the time getting booze and drugs into a concert was as easy as strapping on a backpack). However, he was great and kept his antics to some mumbling and the occasional nonsense lyrics. The concert was exceptional and I was fairly close to the front of the stage so got a good look at the band. Some surprises - at the time I had no idea Manzarek played keyboard bass. When the band first came on and was tuning up I kept waiting for some guy to come out with a bass! The other surprise was the opening act, Albert King. I had never heard of him but he completely blew me away and left me with a lifelong love of the blues. That he played a few numbers with The Doors was icing on the cake.<br /><br />As for the album, I give it five stars because I was there and it was a great show. As some have commented the recording isn't the greatest but other than Morrison's voice and the drums being a bit soft, the sound and separation isn't bad. It's particularly cool to hear Krieger's guitar playing so clearly. I don't remember if it was the case for this show, but at the time it was fairly common for the singer to be miked through the amps rather than using the giant stacked or hanging speakers we see today. Consequently, vocals were often hard to hear. I remember Morrison's voice as being low and somewhat distorted so it's nice to be able to hear them on the recording quite clearly. It's hard to overstate the power of this band in concert. This recording, while showcasing the band well, doesn't really capture that intensity (unlike 'Absolutely Live').<br /><br />The highlight was definitely the 20 minute version of 'Light my Fire' with 'The End' being a close second. Back then - the longer and the more jamming involved, the better. The only disappointment was the omission of 'When the Music's Over' but you can't have everything. All in all, a great time and if you weren't there - sorry!can't have everything. All in all, a great time and if you weren't there - sorry!
B005J4ASDG|4.0|The work of Mr Shore is great. I have the CD of soundtrack. As a musician i will tell this is not a symphony in spite of structured part as movements. I will call a suite that because the the themes are not blended one in others. But as the listener i like it. I like the pieces of every movement. Its was chosen with style deserving the name of Suite. Mr Shore blended the main theme as secondary (background) in other tracks or developed the main theme. I will praise with 4 stars because the vocals.  The vocals have not a strong impact as in other recordings but still above average.<br />Worth to buy.

0385342063|4.0|This book was a cute read that was a little painful at times with some of the awkward moments Poppy finds herself in. One thing I would warn readers on Kindle, though. The book had footnotes which were funny but on a Kindle are only at the end of the chapter. So I'd pull the Kindle app up on my phone and found the footnotes there and then referenced back and forth. Good story though. Definitely recommend!

B006OV7S1I|4.0|Right now you probably know Elizabeth Olsen as the younger sister of the tycoon Olsen twins. After you see Martha Marcy May Marlene, you'll know her as an actress of uncommon subtlety and feeling. It's a sensational performance in a gripping psychological thriller, from gifted first-time writer-director Sean Durkin, that reveals its secrets in the silence between words.    Olsen plays Martha, a young woman we meet on the day she decides to run away from a cult located in the Catskills. Durkin and the skilled cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes present scenes of life in the cult farmhouse with a painterly serenity that only later flashbacks will dispel. After two years in this life, Martha calls her older sister, Lucy (Sarah Paulson), who unblinkingly offers Martha the comfort of the Connecticut lake house she shares with her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy).    Adjustment doesn't come easy for Martha, who thinks she can deprogram herself without telling anyone else about her ordeal. Lucy and Ted going at it in bed doesn't deter Martha from climbing in with them. And the fear of simple socializing almost matches Martha's terror of being found out and pulled back to the cult.    Durkin shows us Martha's past in sequences of escalating menace. John Hawkes is indelibly hypnotic at conveying the brilliance and brutality of Patrick, the cult leader who seduces Martha into a life subservient to only one ego: his. When the outside world intrudes, female cultists - whose sexual initiation with Patrick is labeled a \\"cleansing\\" - use the name Marlene. But Patrick thinks Martha looks like a Marcy May (title mystery solved). Gradually the film emerges as a mesmerizing meditation on identity. Paulson shines as a woman who can't figure out who her sister really is. We share her impatience, especially when Patrick stages a violent invasion. But it's Olsen, as a damaged soul clinging to shifting ground, who makes this spellbinder impossible to shake.    Read more:[...]
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I was shocked by how the tone in this installment had shifted. It is almost as if the director was out to make fun of the film he was creating. The wedding toasts, really? Gah! Embarrassing to watch. The dialog was stilted and the acting was soap opera'ish'. Poor Taylor Lauten seems to have been given the worst direction. What happened to the breath taking scenery? Even the scenes shot on the honeymoon were nothing special. Parts of the film looked like a television series while others, most notably Edward and Bella leaving in the Volvo for the honeymoon, looked like a car commercial. I really hope the second installment is better but if shot the same time as the first, there is little hope for improvement. What a shame. This whole series could have been something spectacular if one great director had stepped up to helm all of the installments, like Peter Jackson did for the Lord of the Rings films.

Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.\\"<br /><br />From the first page of R.J. Palacio's debut novel, readers are rooting for Auggie Pullman, who due to the 27 surgeries needed to help correct his craniofacial abnormalities, has been homeschooled all his life. But now, he'll enter the middle school at Beecher Prep, like a lamb headed for slaughter.<br /><br />Auggie is keenly aware of how people react to his face, from averting their eyes to staring to talking behind their hands about him. Auggie, his parents and his sister had created some level of comfort on their block and in their normal routine, and even through things like a toy astronaut's helmet he wore everywhere when he was a few years younger. But now it is time to face the world, and readers come along for the journey.<br /><br />Although Auggie is a character that induces a great deal of sympathy, there is a depth and realness to his character. He loves Star Wars, he tells good jokes, and he loves his dog, not unlike most of the young boys I know. Because he is more than his exterior, this book is able to transcend the \\"after school special\\" land that a book about a child with a birth defect often remains in.<br /><br />Palacio's choice to tell the story through sections with different narrators is what propels it into award winning territory. Hearing from Auggie's point of view is very important, but hearing from his sister Via, and some of the children at school adds another dimension to Wonder that works to its advantage. And it's rare that so many points of view are given and done well in a book for young readers.<br /><br />One line that is repeated by the teenager characters in the book is \\"the universe was not kind to Auggie Pullman.\\" And though this is true, and painfully real to readers, Wonder is not bogged down in Auggie's suffering. It's a book with a great deal of heart and joy, and a message that will resonate with both children and adults without seeming forced or contrived. The universe may not always be kind, but we are all able to be. I am thankful for the reminder.the teenager characters in the book is \\"the universe was not kind to Auggie Pullman.\\" And though this is true, and painfully real to readers, Wonder is not bogged down in Auggie's suffering.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|It is rare that I enjoy a second book more than the first in a trilogy (I am usually disappointed in the second books) and Pandemonium is definitely one of these rarities.<br /><br />I loved Lauren Oliver's Before I Fall, but I never really got into Delirium.  I think Ms. Oliver is a fantastic writer, but the story in Delerium was too slow for my taste.  Her prose and world building in Delerium were fantastic, but parts of the story just dragged for me.<br /><br />The story really picks up the pace in Pandemonium and I enjoyed it and can't wait for the third installment.<br /><br />Pandemonium follows Lena after she escapes her life and witnesses Alex's death.  The first part of the book switches from \\"then,\\" to, \\"now.\\"  Then picks up immediately after Delerium and now is some period of time later.  The switching of time periods was done well and I had no problem remembering where Lena was in each storyline.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists in this book, although the major one, revealed in the very last chapter, is fairly predictable.  Having said that, I would have been disappointed had it not happened.<br /><br />The story ends with a big cliffhanger (the last twist), but it does so in a way that sets up the next book without being frustrating.  Pandemonium is its own story, not just a chapter in the larger trilogy story.<br /><br />Lena's journey as a character felt believable.  We already saw much of it in Delerium, but she sheds some of the annoying characteristics she had in the first book and really grow into her own in this one.  She becomes more confident and self-sufficient and it is done is a completely authentic way.<br />Although I missed some of the characters from Delerium, I liked the new characters in this book.  Raven, Tack and Julian were all three dimensional, real people.  I think that the introduction of the new setting and new characters really makes this book stand alone, instead of having it feel like filler in a trilogy.<br /><br />As New Yorker, I loved that much of the book took place in Manhattan and nearby.  It was fun to read about the future NYC and I always enjoy reading futuristic books that take advantage of New York's intricate underground subway system.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me was some of the construction of the dystopia.  I kept wondering why the society doesn't cure its prison inmates.  It would seem to be an easy way to keep them controlled and there wouldn't be any worry about anyone escaping.<br /><br />Other than that (and a few other) little nit picks, I really enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Delerium and even those who were a little bit iffy about it.

0446547654|4.0|This is the second book I have read by Nicholas Sparks. My first book was Safe Haven and I was hooked. The Best of Me started a little slow but it did get interesting. It kept me hooked but the way it ended sucked! I felt there was too much bad happening to the good characters. People you would not expect certain things to happen to just got pulverized in the book or worse. I think when anyone reads a book and one where a character has had some bad beginnings you follow the book in  hopes that at least it gets better whether he gets the girl or not. If that doesn't happen you end the book, and make a really strong drink to take the depressed feeling off like I did after reading the book :( Not fair Mr Sparks to play with your readers emotions like that.<br />And why does there always have to be death involved or abuse or a ghost?  At least that is the trend I have seen in the two I have read so far.<br />So why did give the book a four? Overall the book was well written in my opinion and the story was interesting. Just sad and after you read it you feel emotionally drained and sad.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again. This is one of the best of Sparks' books in my opinion. I have read many of his books, and this is in my top five. Nicholas Sparks is an extremely talented author, and this is another of his well written books.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I can't even make a profile like I'm not going to be able to have fun with the darn app so how about I uninstall this useless freaken app!
B004XISI4A|1.0|The author has lost control of all the multiple characters and plotlines. I churned through the first book, could not finish this one. It gets bogged down and needed a serious edit and the whole thing of it being a catch up on what happened meanwhile with the characters missing from book 4 was a terrible device. The story went backwards.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I agree with Boss the crate is to low in the air.Can someone fix this? Other wise its a great game good gameplay perfect for someone who is bored.
B006UG90RM|4.0|The first Van Halen effort in 14 years, \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" finds the band returning to it's 70's roots- specifically, using demos and previously unreleased tracks to create a large chunk of this new CD. Also back in the fold is lead vocalist David Lee Roth, who manages to provide the swagger the Rock and Roll Hall Of Famers had been missing for at least the last 20 years.<br /><br />Old school fans will not be disappointed. Nearly all the demos the band dug up are heavier than anything found in the post-Roth era (1985-98). Not a ballad is to be found, there are no cover tunes, and there's nary a trace of keyboards. \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"Bullethead\\", \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\", and \\"Outta Space\\" are all crunchy, guitar-laden numbers that could have been used in 1980. Edward Van Halen seems to be reborn on this record- his guitar work is cohesive, inspired, and most of the time, just plain amazing, the way it was a generation ago. Perhaps it's because he wants to show his son, Wolgang, how he used to tear it up long before he was born.<br /><br />For the record, Wolfie, replacing original bassist Michael Anthony back in 2007, performs very admirably, though his backing vocals don't stand out the way Anthony's did. Drummer Alex Van Halen, the elder statesman at 59, is exceptional, with no hint of slowing down--it's as if he's still in 1984, wowing fans with the opening to \\"Hot For Teacher\\". As for Diamond Dave, he seems to have the most rust. His vocals sound occasionally forced, and he can't yelp and hit the high notes like he used to, but at 57, we can forgive him. He's helped bring back the fun, which is demonstrated on the first single, \\"Tattoo\\", and the barn-burner \\"Stay Frosty\\".<br /><br />Looking at the big picture, the only two albums in the Van Halen library that are better than \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" are the 1978 self titled debut, and \\"1984\\". Yes, the new record is THAT GOOD. It's my hope that this isn't the band's swan song, but in the event it is,it's a heck of a way to cap a four decade career. 4 1/2 stars

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I selected this book since the entire series is on the top book list for 2011.  I THOUGHT I was going to read something light due to it being a young adult book.  Was I wrong!!  While it was definitely a fast read, it was due to the fact I could not put this down.  The book is a little dark for young readers though the violence is limited (but very realistic and appropriate for the setting) and romance is kept at young love and no sex (after all the heroine is a young girl).  This book is about survival and learning about yourself when your life is turned upside down.  The characters are not the one-dimensional type...they have flaws as well as strengths.  If you haven't read this book because you think it's a kid's book. think again.  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to read a good book about young people who live in terrible conditions where only inner strength must be found to survive.

B003EV6DBM|3.0|I am a Dr addict! In the last 3 months I have ordered and watched Series 1 to 4 and 6 plus the matching specials. All came in full screen format. So far I can only find wide screen for the fifth season on Amazon. I hate the wide screen format and will not buy it at any time.<br />Why is the fifth season not out in normal TV full screen? I will order it ASAP when that is available.<br />Otherwise I have loved the quality of all my previously purchased Dr Who's from Amazon.

1402712367|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite. I bought it for my 9 yr. old granddaughter, wanted to share this treasure with her!
B006OFN0SE|4.0|This is an underrated film, which I caught somewhat by accident....<br /><br />Overall, Clint Eastwood's treatment of Hoover struck me as more balanced, than I'd anticipated.  While I am certainly not an historian, I am assuming that there is a great deal of material in this movie, which cannot be historically verified.  Over the years, however, I've done a lot of reading about the Lindbergh kidnapping and the execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.  From what I know of that case, [[ASIN:B007BLCGNU J. Edgar]] seemed historically accurate - at least on that subject matter.<br /><br />On another note, I could never have imagined DeCaprio in this role.  His makeup transformation into an older Hoover was incredible.  On the other hand, the makeup transformation of Armand Hammer into an older Clyde Tolson seemed amateurish.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I must say that this is by far my favorite Mission Impossible movie. There was no wasting time in this film it was all spy action and fun. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of MI4. The whole cast did brilliantly and we got to see everyone take the spotlight at some point in the film. I think what I liked most about this film was that it wasn't cluttered with romantic mush like previous movies (not only MI movies but other spy films as well). And it spent more time keeping you in a state of awe and worry for the characters. I love spy gadgets and this film was filled to the brim with gadgets, twists, turns and smooth talking secret agents. I give it a 5/5. :)
0985081821|5.0|this book was AWESOME!  this is one of those books that get you sucked into a world you want to be in, and the characters are really cool people you would have a beer and pizza with....for real :o)  so stop reading this and get the book!
B006P0FIGU|5.0|When I first went to see this movie I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. I had expectations yes, but they weren't the highest. Boy was I wrong. This movie was great fun to watch.<br /><br />I did not go see it in 3d because personally 3d doesn't do much for me but the 2d experience was great. What I really enjoyed about this movie was that it had a little bit of everything, funny characters, semi-engaging storyline, romance, action, and good looking men ;)<br /><br />To me the storyline was just right for the film, there was a lot going on with the characters interactions with each other and they did a good job of playing back to things that happen early in the film and adding twists, confusion, and even a few surprises. The characters all have their quirks from D'Artagnan's cocky statements to King Louis' insecurity's and childlike attitude. The film has an overall funny feel to it with a good deal of jokes and silly encounters which I really enjoyed. There's nothing like going to an action movie and getting some laughs out of it as well.<br /><br />The romance aspect was small but effective as it helped move the storyline along in different ways. Different characters had to deal with different aspects of romance and each issue helped push the plot and characters in ways that were both expected and unexpected. As for the action all I can say is wow. I love watching a good sword fight happen and this movie was full of excellent swordplay. Along with swords, bombs, explosives, and guns were all used adding to the action.<br /><br />This movie is not a tradition rendering of the Three Musketeers and has a steam punk feel to it making it a Three Musketeers for the modern age. Overall it was fun to watch and enjoy. I enjoyed it enough that I went to see it twice in theaters and already have plans to purchase the DVD release. Overall I give it a five star review because I loved it that much. :)
0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning is one of those stories that remains in your mind for years after having read it. The stories duel nature, the first half of the book recounting his experiences in Nazi concentration camps and the second half explaining the essence of logotheraphy, instills a hope in the reader that allows one to find meaning in the struggles of life. Viktor Frankl's explanation of finding meaning in ones life is from trite. The practice of logotheraphy presents itself as real and difficult yet obtainable. In using his own story he does not glorify his triumph in overcoming the brutality of the camps, yet he recapitulates his experience for the purpose of presenting an example to demonstrate how even after the roughest of situations hope can be found. His story instilled the feeling  of strength and power within myself and I can almost guarantee these same feelings will be found in every reader.
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|Allow me to begin by saying that I love Andrew Lloyd Webber. I think he's brilliant. The stories are complex and winding, just as the music is. The music is always so beautiful in his pieces.<br /><br />That said, the storyline of this musical is horrible, even with the rewrites done for this filmed Australian version. Nothing can save this plotline, as it honestly reads like very bad fanfiction. But there's some redemption, as the music is still beautiful and complex. It very much conveys the Coney Island feeling of strange and wonderful very well. Parts of the musical read like Rogers and Hammerstein (such as \\"Look with You Heart,\\" that could easily fit into something like 'The King and I' or 'The Sound of Music') while other parts are classic, 1970s ALW, such as \\"The Beauty Underneath.\\" The cast is good. I do think it was well-cast. The production is beautiful--from the stage to the lights to the sound. But in the end, it is still related to this awful plotline that I'm not entirely sure why it exists. I think the music is complex and beautiful. The staging is beautiful and complex. But nothing can save this bad, almost melodramatic storyline.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Jazz for the new millennium - excellently done! Someone here said their mother was 55 and didn't think the drumbeats appropriate for jazz. Well I'm 56 and I think everything about this cd is slammin! It harkens back to the progressive jazz days when guys like Lonnie Listen Smith, Roy Ayers, and George Duke were doing some amazing things. There's always been a dispute between jazz purists and jazz progressives. Miles Davis made a progressive album (Man With The Horn) and you would've thought the universe had turned upside down. Good music is good music, and this cd is some seriously good music.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so awesome I've seen it before it was very very very very very very very very very interesting and awesome
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was so excited with all the hype this book got.  A story about a magical competition to the death should be enthralling, suspenseful, majestic and yet ...I did not feel it. Yes, the glorious world that these two battling magicians create as they strive to outdo one another in the night circus keeps the interest going.  However, there is a predictability in the love story between the two main characters, so that I did not feel their emotions as intensely as the blazing bonfire that magically fueled the exotic circus.  So, much praise for the imagination capable of creating a mystical circus that defies all laws of science and allows us to experience a childlike wonder.  A solid read for fantasy fans, an overall B+.

B004UXUX7S|4.0|The Descendants marks Alexander Payne's return to directing after a seven year absence and before The Artist stole its thunder it was considered the Oscar front-runner in the Best Picture and Best Actor categories. In the end, it won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Critically speaking, it's quite the comeback. In almost 20 years Payne has directed only five films, all from screenplays co-written with his writing partner Jim Taylor. This is the first film the two have not collaborated on the script for, although Taylor remains a producer and Payne's consistency remains as well. As a director, Payne has displayed a unique style that functions through the acting, editing, music, camera work, and writing. That style that was so prevalent in Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways is not as prominent here. It has that quirky Payne-humor coupled with heartwrenching drama, but I wonder if Payne chose to play it safe for his comeback. It obviously worked for him in most circles, but this being his most commercial, straight-forward, and safe effort left me underwhelmed. Payne still deftly blends poignant drama with just the right dose of comedy, once again giving us one of the best films of last year. I just say this with less enthusiasm than I have had for his previous films.<br /><br />The Descendants is based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings and was shot on location in Hawaii. George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer and the sole trustee of untouched Hawaiian land. With the trust set to expire in seven years, Matt is in the middle of a big deal to sell the land when his wife Elizabeth is involved in a boating accident that puts her in a coma. A dire prognosis forces Matt, who has always been the \\"back-up parent,\\" to take charge in caring for his two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). His relationship with Alex is already strained when she reveals a secret about her comatose mother that unravels Matt's entire life.<br /><br />The beautiful Hawaiian setting adds an ironic contrast to the heavy material. Like any film shot in Hawaii this is beautiful to look at, but the scenery takes a backseat to the involving and touching story. There's a good reason Payne is on the short list of filmmakers retaining final cut privileges to their films. He's a master at handling heavy dramatic subjects with subtlety and humor, while demonstrating a firm grasp on characters and their development. This is a very consistent film with several wonderful scenes. Look at the beautifully acted confrontation between Clooney and Matthew Lillard. It's a bittersweet, tense scene, heartfelt and funny that reveals Lillard as an effective, underutilized talent. He plays this scene to perfection, never over-playing it and finding the perfect balance of guilt, fear, and regret.<br /><br />There's a character named Sid (played by Nick Krause), who shows up doing his best Keanu Reeves impression and seemingly has no role in the story except to accompany Alex and frustrate Matt. Never one to stick to conventions, Payne builds this character to a surprisingly poignant moment with Matt that feels remarkably sincere when it would've seemed contrived in the hands of a lesser writer/director. Finally, Matt's goodbye to his wife is one of the most quietly moving scenes of any film last year. It's a brief, beautiful moment; understated, despite being the film's emotional climax.<br /><br />Robert Forster and Beau Bridges do memorable turns with very few scenes, while Lillard emerges from his permanent spot as Shaggy in anything Scooby-Doo related to show off unexpected range. Miller and Woodley are terrific as the daughters, particularly the 20-year-old Woodley who gives a performance that blows many of her contemporaries out of the water. It announces the emergence of a bright young actress, who is wasting her talent on that unfortunate television show.<br /><br />Clooney, meanwhile, gives his most mature performance to date and certainly one of his best. It's a far cry from the suave, deliriously handsome characters he usually plays. His performance as Matt King is quiet, heartbreaking, and without an ounce of bravado. It shows him in a completely different light. That scene between Matt and his comatose wife is real, powerful acting. Out of the five Best Actor nominees, Clooney was no doubt the runner-up.<br /><br />The Descendants is professionally-made, high-quality melodrama that never diverges into new territory and only separates itself from the pack with Payne's offbeat blend of the comic and tragic. It doesn't rank too highly on the list, but it is one of 2011's best films despite the faint scent of Oscar-bait that surrounds the entire movie and its failure to make the same impact of Payne's previous work. It may not be profound, but it's hard to dislike or not be affected by. It's a melancholy, pleasing effort that I just don't foresee being discussed years from now. Even with these shortcomings, it has heart and is a welcome return from Alexander Payne and a nice change of pace for George Clooney.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|There's only one thing that bothered me all throughout this series: the relationship among Erika, her husband Greger, and her lover Mikael.  Amongst the weird events and hard to imagine conspiracies, I couldn't get around to accepting this supposedly simplest of all complications in the story.  Oh well...<br /><br />Setting that aside, I'd say this is the best book, a grand finale to a sensational series, I couldn't have imagined  a better conclusion.  All the protagonists ended up well and good, and vindicated; that's expected.  The antagonists were either dead or rounded up by the authorities at the end; that's also expected.  Still, the story held on it's own.  The overall plot, the subplots, and all that happened from beginning to end are all part of a well-thought out, thoroughly researched material.  I would normally have not given any bother to topics such as espionage and conspiracies.  This book deals with those subjects and more. It's the 'more' part and the way the story was put together like a big quilted blanket that made it a great read.

B001NPDCFQ|1.0|Love the movie but it turns into a silent flick on several occasions, including the movie's signature song (the Trolley Song) sung by Judy Garland.  Curiously, I can hear the song--in English--by switching to the French version of the soundtrack (the Spanish version dubs everything).  Amazon was very good about replacing it but the replacement Blu-ray disc had the same problem.  Do not buy this movie in Blu-ray until Warner Video fixes this problem.

B0040ZN9WM|5.0|I bought these sandals for my 3 year old daughter last summer in hot pink and they are really cute.  She could easily get them off & on by herself, but they did not slip off while playing.  The dark pink washed up really well and the shoes held up thru daily wear.  I thought they ran a little small and had to buy a size up.  I'm definitely going to buy them again for this summer!

B004SUDPXW|5.0|Like seasons 1 and 2, Breaking Bad season 3 is some of the most interesting entertainment you're likely to see on television. This series continues to be thrilling and thought provoking.<br /><br />There's very little fluff in this show - most of what you see is relevant to the arc of the story, and more and more there are connections drawn between past episodes and current ones, tying everything neatly together.  Careful viewing reveals nods between episodes, and I love this attention to detail in the script.<br /><br />As I noted in the previous two seasons, the acting all around is superb, but much of the success of this show is due to Bryan Cranston in his portrayal of Walter White.<br /><br />****Spoiler****<br /><br />My favorite episode in season three is \\"Kafakaesque\\".  The scene where Walter's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) spins a story about how Walter can manage to cover Hank's hospital bills is just amazing to watch if you've seen all the previous episodes up to this point. Bryan Cranston's facial expressions and body language during this scene alone prove why he keeps deserving  the Emmy.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|The idea of a child assassin is certainly an interesting one. Especially when it's a young girl that was raised in a forest. You really have no idea what is happening through most of the movie. You know someone is going to try to capture and/or kill Hanna & she must kill them first. As the movie goes on you learn who they are and little bits of information are fed to you here & there. But even knowing what we are told, it still doesn't really explain the entire story. With a fragmented storyline, it was hard to really enjoy the movie. The actress that played Hanna was wonderful. Some of the fight scenes were a little hard to believe. They look choreographed & it was hard to believe she was doing any real damage to grown men. If they had concentrated more on her brains & speed, it would have been more realistic. The acting was great, the storyline not so much, and the end just left me wondering \\"Now what?\\". Disappointing movie overall but a little entertaining.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|I like the look of the cover and it is slim, handy and easy to use.  Their is no place to store a page turner so it is awkward keeping track of the pointer along with my Kindle Fire.
B002RI9K5Y|5.0|The true measure of a great novel is whether one can open it up again after 6 months or 6 years and still find it absorbing. East of Eden is a sprawling tale of good and evil which still has relevance today. A classic of American literature.
B007BLDFWG|3.0|Oh, and it's very slow as well.<br /><br />Okay, so Martha calls her sister to rescue her from a cult that she has run away from. But we never find out why she joined it in the first place and what the whole deal is with it.  The guy running it is more of a modern Manson than a Jim Jones.  It does not seem to be a religious cult but it sure has a hold on its members.<br />What is good is the casting.  Also, the story becomes more ominous and menacing as it goes on.
0062060562|4.0|At times this book feels a little like Groundhog Day & you get repetition of Chris's frustrations which can also be frustrating from a reader's perspective. Nonetheless, it's entertaining & skilfully written especially for a debut novel. If reading about the impact amnesia has on a person interests you then give this book a go.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Relaxing to work this game in the evening before bed.  The music is so soothing too!  Wouldn't spend a day without playing this one.
0307352145|5.0|Finally - a book that validates all the feelings I have had over the years!  This book finally gives credence to the fact that introversion is not a \\"bad\\" thing.  There are so many good things to be learned from introverts and more people are introverted than you realize.  I think we should start demanding equality in a society of extroverts and those pretending to be extroverts.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|My husband and I never read sci fi or futuristic books. We saw a trailer at a recent movie for HUNGER GAMES it caught his attention. For Valentine's Day I ordered the first book from Amazon.com and then of course had to get the other 2. He raved on them so I had to give them a try and really enjoyed them. There were some parts emotionally hard to read but great books that I am so glad I try.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Downloaded game that already had a storm i.d. that couldn't be changed and the restaurant was already furnished so I had to uninstall the game....so sad

B0052U59F4|4.0|I had to see what all the praise was about. I'm a fan of Twilight, and for me, the fact that this started off as fan fic wasn't a turn off...if anything, it made me want to read it more to see how it played out.<br />If you check out my other reviews, you'd see that I'm definitely not shy about my love of erotica, and I read a lot of erotic stuff from the super taboo to more 'vanilla' things. One of my interests is BDSM and I'm usually so frustrated because writers seldom get it right. Surprisingly, E.L. James did a pretty good job! I really felt Anastasia's fear and Christian's issues shining through. I guess the only thing I have issue with is not all practitioners of BDSM are using it as a crutch for their issues. The ones that know what they're doing follow the credo: safe, sane, and consensual.<br />But other than that, I felt like she did a good job building tension and the sex scenes...*fans myself* Def gonna by the others in this series!

B004ZNANZA|4.0|The Wall has always been my favorite Pink Floyd album.  I have the original CD when it was released in the 90's.  I expected that this remaster would give it a boost in volume like some other remasters do but unfortunately, it doesn't.  I still have to turn the volume up louder than with other CDs.  It does sound a bit better than my previous version but I expected more.  The bass is solid and the sound separation is good.  The demo CD is interesting because it shows the development of songs.  The digipak has the original artwork and the booklet has the lyrics.  If you're interested in hearing the demos than you should get this, if not, stick with your current copy.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|great quality blu ray but I have some issues with the brighness and colors. I think the colors and the picture qulaity are not great at times. I played this in both my samsung tv and also on 150' projector screen. not as good as when I compare this to other blu rays like spider man etc. may be it is due to 1:1.78 (16:9) format.
0316098329|3.0|This book was hard to get into for me. It could have been the fact that it is written from a 5-yr olds perspective but it was a bit boring in the beginning. It did pick up in the middle but I was a bit disappointed in the anticlimatic ending to this book after the exciting escape scenes. Wish that the author would have changed the point of view to give you a better appreciation for how the other characters reacted to the events.
B001S86J1C|5.0|What can be said about this movie that already hasn't? I grew up in the 80's and this is one of the best of the era! Buy it, watch it, love it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|soo addicting to get all the games open. and then you get rewarded for it. some are super easy while others are a challenge! good luck.
B004MGMIA8|5.0|If you love Strauss' Music, you will adore this Complete Edition!!!!!! Certain picky reviews on the web kinda got me confused initially about buying this product... unless you are looking for \\"absolute perfection\\" from a serious music critic's point of view, you'll love this Complete Edition!!!! I know I will cherish this collection for a LONG time; It sure is worth every penny!<br /><br />In conclusion, I was very impressed with Amazon's quick service!! Thank you!
0545265355|1.0|These books were terrible at so  many levels.  Bad writing, no good grammar, syntax sucks, all in the present tense.  Bad character development, none actually and the main character is just a sour, angry, weak personality.  Not very likely that someone with a character like that would become a hero or a leader.  Bad plot development, especially in book 2 and 3. I had to reread some chapters because it wasn't clear what had happened almost as if chapters had been ripped out of the book.  It is clear that the author is a screen writer, because that is what the books are written for a movie; a bad movie!  What bothers me about it is that there are so many good young adult books (The lost Years of Merlin to name just one) that are well written how come this trash gets promoted so much?
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I am sure no other book I have read in the last decade has impacted me as much as this book. I am forever changed as a human and consumer of meats. I thought his book was insightful, honest and detailed. I did not think it was overly biased, as I can imagine a book on this topic could be, but so well written it was beyond persuasive. I knew some of this information before from other books, but for some reason this book hit home.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Just downloaded this tonight. So far its fun... a little confusing... but I am liking it. We'll see how it goes the next few days.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I have played all of the unlocked and a couple of the initially locked games.  I have found gameplay to be what you would expect from a very generalized collection, uninspired but not bad.  Lots of variety but so far no real grabber as far as replay value is concerned.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|I was very excited to see a game like this out for Andorids. I loved the old PC games like Myst and Raven.<br /><br />there was only one thing I didn't care for. ( had to go online to look it up, and still doesn't make sense to me) very cool game tho.<br /><br />I got it on 3-3-2012 it was the free app of the day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is easy to navigate as well as offering several different versions of the Bible. Just starting to use this but I like it so far.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Make no mistake, Warrior is what I refer to as The Perfect Friday Night Movie: Get a pizza in (preferably thin crust!)wipe your HDTV screen clean, and stick on the blu-ray. For a ridiculously touched-up poster, Warrior didn't have to convince me to see it; the fact Tom Hardy has been referred to as the British Marlon Brando is the reason. With the exception of Christian Bale, I absolutely detest The Fighter: It's riddled with more Irish-American cliches than Far and Away and is oh-so annoying at the best of times. You can understand my trepidation as I waited for this drama to unfold.<br /><br />As \\"Tap 'em Out\\" Tommy Reardon, Tom Hardy is massive. The guy's traps are enormous (he's gigantic!) and given his turbulent performance, one can only wet themselves at the prospect of seeing him kick Batman's ass in The Dark Knight Rises. He spends much of his time brooding,looking mean and makes a great effort with his US accent (which I am assuming is an amalgam of regional US dialects or do the good people of Pittsburgh talk like that?) He makes taking a swig of whiskey seem like an art form and can understand why his character has no sense of ambition any more, which is revealed through a surprise twist, midway. And Mr Hardy is that rare thing since Gary Oldman: He's scary and unpredictable. Tom's dual role not only required a physical transformation, but to convince us he's an MMA fighter (don't worry, I was convinced within 1 minute!)A credit to director Gavin O'Connor, who said Tommy was the only actor who could play the troubled, younger Conlon sibling.<br /><br />This isn't just a film about slugging it out UFC-style; this is a class in heavyweight acting. Tom's scenes with Nick Nolte as his ex-alcoholic father Paddy, are both funny and very moving. If Nolte doesn't get an Oscar nod (and post Oscar hindsight, he did but was robbed), then there's no justice in this world..the old man's still got it and sure he recalled his drunken past for this role of a lifetime. Joel Edgerton is another Aussie who's graduated from the \\"Time to Fool Everyone with a Convincing American Accent, School of Acting\\" - as Tom's elder brother, Brendan Conlon. It takes a long time before they meet (think of DeNiro and Pacino in Heat) and when they do, it's intense and explosive stuff. One of the twists is that they fight each other in the ring; how they get there will become apparent as you watch.<br /><br />In what is billed as a man's film, Jennifer Morrison from House is the calming influence as Brendan's missus. She's not just a pretty blonde, she has heart and she's sassy too. I could believe more in her as Tess; than Amy Adams's Oirish barmaid in The Fighter, who, let's face it, was quite the skank! Warrior's' greatest strength is that it takes its time and doesn't overwhelm you and doesn't try to prove anything either. It's great film making and Gavin O'Connor deserves a pint (or three). In much the same way Rocky(1976) was shot on a very low budget, this has that same Everyman approach. In fact,<br />Warrior owes a debt to Rocky in its pre-title credits and the split-screen training montages. The fights are a feast for any UFC fan and kick serious ass. In parts, it's classic Americana: Downbeat and has a lot of charm; on the other, it makes me want to visit Pittsburgh now and to stick Ode to Joy on my iPod!<br /><br />Special nods to the actors who played the students; the always great Kevin Dunn as Principal Zito (you couldn't make it up) and Bryan \\"The Hangover\\" Callen as a very funny UFC commentator. And Kurt Angle as a Russian head case!<br /><br />If I have any gripes about Warrior, is that I would've liked to have seen the regimen of training to become an Ultimate Fighting Champion. And more scenes of Jennifer Morrison in her underwear (maybe they'll happen to find some deleted scenes and stick them on the blu-ray).<br /><br />The blu-ray is gorgeous - do yourself the biggest favour and order it from Amazon: I prefer the cover of a lone Tommy with his back to us; than an overpriced high street record store, who uses a different poster and hikes up the price as well. The film looks amazing and the special features are great (nice to see Hardy looking comfortable in an interview as opposed to being interrogated by a second-rate UK chat show host).<br /><br />Since critics have compared Tom to Brando, in which case I'll leave you with his most memorable role as ex prize-fighter, Terry Malloy from On the Waterfront. Yes, I still get the chills re-watching it and yes, I'm sure Hardy drew some inspiration too. An all-time, classic movie moment.<br />[...]ommy with his back to us; than an overpriced high street record store, who uses a different poster and hikes up the price as well.

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|this movie blends in perfectly to the 1982 movie this movie is on par with the 1982 movie and yes this movie seriously is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is one of my favorite prequel movies its just as cool and as fun as the star wars prequel films!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006O5Y0SS|3.0|The film starts with the disembodied voice of Owen Wilson - doing an impressive impersonation of the young Woody Allen. This illusion comes to an abrupt end when we see Wilson who plays Gil Pender with a physicality that resurrected another Woody - the goofy bartender from Cheers. This was much more surreal than the plot, a pretentious version of Bill and Ted's excellent adventure set in a travel brochure for Paris.
B000RH0C8G|1.0|I thought the book was poorly written and quite boring.... while some of the information was interesting, it could have been covered in a single \\"Sports Illustrated\\" article.
0807014273|5.0|I found this book to be incredibly good.  It's one of only a couple books I've found myself reading without any knowledge of the time that's gone by.  It's a small book but has great spiritual, emotional, and moral qualities.  It helped me understand some of my own emotions I felt, when realizing how to many, human life was insignificant while being in prison. The way he described his release was also similar to my own experiences.  Although the comparison is no where equal.  I believe there are many similarities.  I recommend this book for everyone.  It will keep you entertained from cover to cover.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I have a new I Phone and needed this book before a book club meeting. There wasn't time to get a hard copy so I downloaded the Kindle app and bought the book for my phone.  This was perfect for my busy travel schedule and it was easy to read after enlarging the font one size.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its really good when ur bored... I'm bored a lot so I'm obsessed with it... I'm so happy its free. I'm very lifeless... -.-
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Let me start by acknowledging that this is a terrific book.  Characters make their way through a photo-negative world, where the sun and moon are dark, and everyone orbits and is illuminated by the black star, the terrifying enigma at the center of a pathological culture.  In this mirror world, the luckiest families are those wrenched apart early, before the poison of betrayal turns children into informers, or worse.  As in all totalitarian societies, the dictator makes war on his real enemy: the sanctuary to be found inside citizens' own minds.  As in Terry Gilliam's Brazil, the only escape is to resist the erosion of the self.<br /><br />Set in a fictional totalitarian society, it would be an okay book.<br /><br />But it's set in the last real totalitarian state, the country that has the unnerving distinction of being visible from space as a black lacuna in the night.  The suffering of the people of North Korea is quite real, and far more terrifying than even a writer of Johnson's considerable talents can describe.<br /><br />Johnson's done his research, so far as we can tell.  He's been to North Korea, he's no doubt read the defectors' accounts and he's probably spoken to the men and women who keep an eye (insofar as that is possible) on the hermit kingdom.  But the enormous weight of the true unspoken, unwritten, unpublished grief, tragedy, extinction, despair hangs over this book.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no autochthonous North Korean dissident literature.  The ocean of tears shed in the North have, as yet, not found their chronicler.  Even in Stalin's Russia, at the height of the terror, Mikhail Bulgakov was able to write The Master and Margarita.  The distinction between that book and Johnson's couldn't be clearer.  When Woland gaily declares \\"Nonsense! Manuscripts don't burn\\". the reader comprehends in a flash the legions of silenced voices whose manuscripts, indeed, were burnt and lost, and who rotted away in dark basements or in the Gulag somewhere.  That is the power of authenticity.<br /><br />To read this book is to experience the uneasy feeling that one is truly seeing into North Korean society, while at the same time knowing perfectly well that it was composed amid the sunlit halls of Stanford.<br /><br />I don't begrudge anyone the pleasures of this book.  But do me a favor and read [[ASIN:0385523912 Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea]] and [[ASIN:0802130119 The Master and Margarita]] afterwards.  Art can indeed be a weapon against totalitarianism---indeed, it may be the only truly effective such weapon.  But only if the artist risks his life in the act.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Usually, the second book in any series is a real let-down. But not Beautiful Darkness! No, this book, in my opinion, was the BEST in the series (so far... I'm waiting to see if the fourth and final one is my favorite). Every single character was so realistic, it was frightening.  I fell in love with Ethan and Macon all over again. And I became so angry at the evil characters, including Lena. That's what made the book so great. I felt so many emotions when I read this book. I was in some fantasical emotional rollercoaster all throughout this book. It was amazing! They brought in many new characters that contributed to the 3rd book, Beautiful Chaos,as well, and, ahh, everything was... AMAZING! There's wayy to many good things to say about this book. The characters, the setting, ohh, everything was great! I was bawling (happy tears, though) at the end of this book. I was an amazing ending. Though, the last page at the end makes you angry. It seems like everything is going to be fine, but, ehh, no... If you want to read the BEST book ever... Read. This. Book.
B001NLKT60|2.0|I really do not get why these books are so popular.  They read like YA, only with more sex and violence.  Sure, they're page turners, but when you end almost every chapter with a cliff hanger, it's easy to entice people to read on.  Put it this way - if you like Dan Brown books, you'll like these.  Otherwise, yawn.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|The Amazon series of Downton Abbey is most appreciated.  The cast is outstanding, and each one is ideal for the part they play.  The period costumes are beautiful and add to the events going on in the mansion.  Although the story is set in times almost a hundred years ago, the various dramas playing out between the family and the servants is capivating and I hope that the series will continue beyond Season 2.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|Maybe it's just me but I like only about half the renditions of Dylan's songs in this collection The song choices are fine and represent his career, but I'm not so fond of the interpretations. I have several tribute cds and this is the least favorite. Maybe it's best not to try to make a folk song into a heavy metal song. Somehow the message gets mangled. All in all, I would suggest that if you want Dylan songs, buy Dylan, not some other artist's rendition.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I purchased this Intel i3 CPU to use in a server running Mac OS X 10.7, and I have to say, like the other reviews for this product, I am very impressed. When in use, the CPU temperature is about 90° Fahrenheit, which is quite cool. The performance is fast, nothing to brag about like an i5 or i7, but it's great for my purposes. It runs well, and paired with the Gigabyte GA-H61M-DS2 motherboard and 8GB of gaming RAM, makes a great Mac server for under $250.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great game,  old school play with good music and a corny but fun story. Best free game download in a long time. Can't wait for Radiant 2!
B0041KKYCY|5.0|My husband loved the original movie and could not wait to see the remake.  He loved this one as well and said it is almost as good as the original.  He has both this and the original in his growing movie collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire, and even better when I can play it on my nextbook! This game is VERY addictive.
B003L77TZI|5.0|My daughter loves this album as much as I do.  The only thing is that almost all of these songs talk about things I do not want my daughter asking me at such a young age.  I mean \\"I wanna see your Peacock, cock, cock, Your Peacock.\\"  was to much for me.
0062082353|5.0|I just finished reading this book on my Kindle. I was truey impressed with Chief Kyle's account of how his career unfolded. I'm not one to pick apart gramar or sentence structure or other petty crap like that. Espeially since the Chief is not a professional author. I took the book for what it is; an account of a Navy SEAL's life. I have no issues what so ever about Chief's taking enjoyment in killing so many of the enemy. After all, that is his job and what he was trained to do. I'm sure some of the people posting negative reviews and calling him a blood thirst maniac would much rather have some of these savages come to America and blow up their children's school. It's a hard job and Chief definitely did more than his part to ensure security in Iraq and here at home. I admire his resilience and his ability to deal with all the stresses of combat and still take out so many of our enemy before they could achieve their objectives of killing American Military Personnel. This is an outstanding book and a riveting account of the war in Iraq. I would highly recommend this to anyone who cares about America and what exactly it takes to keep it the free, safe country it is.
B004BLTNM0|5.0|My husband was very interested in rewatching the original version again after the recent remake was released.  He loved it, and now has both films in his growing moving collection.

B000S0GYRU|5.0|This was on my husbands wish list for his huge movie collection.  He loved it so much he opened it and watched it as soon as I gave it to him.  This is for the horror fan.
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|Bought this for my 8-yr old who saw Bruno on the latest music awards show and loved his talented performance.  Gave it a listen to do my parental thing and discovered that some of the lyrics are a bit naughty, especially for a child.  Liked the music, just not the words.  Sorry Bruno!
B004I744AS|5.0|Fun to start your day with these quick and interesting tidbits.  A little like the Merriam-Webster game page.  Simple but enjoyable.
B00466HN6S|5.0|Saw this at the theatre with my little boy and we LOVED it!!  It's just a good wholesome film from beginning to end.  This naughty little bunny is worth the $$$ if you ask us. :-)
B0067Q04AM|5.0|There are already many well-written and articulate reviews here, so I'm not trying to find words that have already been expressed. However,<br />it's amazing that so many music listeners are sleeping on this innovative and talented musician!  I have been following RG for sometime, but this CD<br />just blew me away.  Personally, I'm on a mission to spread the word about him and educate the masses.  There is such a void in the music industry right now, well has been for quite some time. It's not possible to depend on radio to introduce talented new jazz artist or those artist that<br />create music outside of traditional genres. If you love great music, do yourself a favor explore and seek out new music/artist for yourself instead of having a steady diet of mediocre or subpar music to listen to across the radio waves.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an AWESOME book!!!  I suggest that you get this one!!  Just look at all the 5 star reviews!!  I read it in two days.

B001NLKT60|5.0|The triolgy written by Stigg Larsson was such a good book it has made my selection of another book to read impossible. I find other books just don't measure up to his writting. Oh well I'll just have to make do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, awesome read! Can't wait for the movie! Reading the other two books now, the series is a very good read!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I truly enjoyed this DVD.  Wonderful love story and a terrific role model for women of any time by Ms. Potter.  She was something else!  Giving the land in trust to keep it protected, standing up for her rights, becoming indepedent at a time when it was difficult to do for a women of any rank in society.  Plus her books are beloved everywhere.  Thank you for making this DVD for so many of us to enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, easy and personalizable. Able to play with my own pics as background. Even choose color for card backs. Good choice of app.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This is a great movie. Finally someone is making movies without 4-letter words! Grab the family and make a large bowl of popcorn and ENJOY!!
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|An easy read about a touching topic. The author created characters that as a reader were easy to want to know. The ending was very clever and totally unexpected. The best part was witnessing the positive personal growth and learning of the main character from a sad situation.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|When I ordered this Microshell Folio Cover I had no idea what to expect.  I had never owned a tablet of any kind.  I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas and was looking for something to protect it while carrying it with me whenever I am away from home.  I was hoping for something that wouldn't add any more weight to what I was already carrying around and that would be easy to use while still doing the job.  This product fit the bill exactly!  As a matter of fact, it was beyond what I was expecting. It is lightweight, fits easily onto the Kindle Fire and slides into my bag perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a cover to fit their Kindle Fire.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for a family member and they haven't been able to stop reading it. So i must say it was a great buy and they are amazing. I recommend it to anyone.
B005BQNC44|4.0|Fantastic book by Jaycee, before reading this book I read Lost and Found: The True Story of Jaycee Lee Dugard and the Abduction that Shocked the World by John Glatt. After reading what happened to Jaycee during the abduction and later years it was good to read her version in her own words. She is an amazing woman and tells a very painful but truthful story. Both books were great and I would recommend both.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost was recommended to me by a friend and it has become one of my favorite television series. The story line is very interesting and keeps me guessing; it's full of surprises. I highly recommnend the series.<br />I purchased the 3rd and 4th seasons through Amazon. Both DVD sets arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I had no problems with the DVD's in season 3. I've reviewed season 4 separately as I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD's and because there were only 13 episodes.<br />Also, I would check out prices elsewhere. Amazon usually beats just about everyone when an item goes on sale, but that was not the case with Lost.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun for everyone in the family!  discriptions of games are a little confusing but trying the game once. explains all
B004I744AS|5.0|love this app. so much better than Websters they supply for kindle fire. love the homepage where you have word of day, quotes etc.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I have no idea of this is a good device or not because the driver was never able to install on my machine.  After 9 or so exchanges with Logitech Support, they couldn't sort out what was going on.  As for the support, I wouldn't bother, the problems are covered in forums and of that doesn't help, Logitech's support knows no more.  If your device doesn't install?  Then just buy the equally competent Nostromo and save yourself the hours of trial and error they'll put you through.<br /><br />Since the whole experience was horrible.  I have to rate based on absolutely no time using the device.  It is beautiful and very well designed but paper-weight is not what I purchased.
B0055SWM08|5.0|buy this now! awesome way to waste some time. has a mellow feel to it. don't let this one pass you by
B004LROUNG|4.0|I'm an avid Grisham fan so I try to read his work as soon as something comes out.  Although I enjoyed his book, The Litigators, I had the feeling that it was written quickly and without as much effort as he has placed in his other work.  The ending was clear way too early and the plot was more fantasy than fiction.<br />The story however was humous and entertaining and therefore worth the read.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The movies arrived before scheduled, in very good condition, and was purchased at a very reasonable price. I am very satisified with this purchase and recommend this seller highly.
0307593312|1.0|This was my first and will be my last Haruki Murakami as it made no sense and I got nothing out of it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love it, I got it for my birthday and I will agree some of the alternations are upsetting but I look past them and focus on the beautiful  picture and sound and of course the magnificent story.  Lucas will never stop with them anyway, we all know this. We have to accept the fact the original movies we know and love will not come about anymore. I wish they will too. But, enjoy the picture, and sound and LOTS of bonus material
B003O86FMW|5.0|Action keeps you hooked, never a dull moment.  A deeper message of what society would be like after catastrophic events.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|These guys have just gotten better with time. It's fantastic to see them ripping into a song like \\"Freewill\\" which was recorded so long ago, with this much passion, precision and commitment. Rush is a band that, love them or hate them, is what they are. And, now, 40 plus years on, are more who they are than ever. The new material, like BU2B, sits perfectly along side the other tracks. The audio quality is amazing, and Geddy's voice is clear unlike the last couple concert video releases, and sounds so good. He can hit the high notes, but it has a depth to it that has grown over time. You can tell the video edits were carried out by true fans... the camera follows the focus of the music. Love the steampunk theme too. Two very small complaints: the show starts off a little mellow, and I get the feeling that they worked over some of the tracks to correct bum notes. There's not a freaking off note in the whole show. Maybe they nailed everything that night, or maybe it's been dressed up a little. Anyway, that's just my producer brain yacking. 2 marks. And the next question goes to Denis Norden.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|One of the first that I used on my kindle fire. Haven't had a problem with it. I find it great with my other computer and all others.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|awesome puzzles, mind clearing and meditative, cannot wait for another expansion. recommended to all family and friends, beautiful melody plays enhancing meditative state of mind<br />.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Rule number 1 of making a double album. DO NOT release all of your sloppy, uninspired B-sides as a full length second disc.<br /><br />First off, let me say that I really like the 1st disc \\"jupiter\\". It has some very strong and solid songs, and delivers a decent album which I can listen to from beginning to end. And that's really all I wanted, just one album. With that being said, the second disc \\"mars\\" is absolutely awful, trite, pathetic garbage which I can't even listen to all the way through. They should have renamed it \\"track skipper\\" rather then mars, cause that's what it is. I'm just constantly skipping tracks in this disheveled mess of an album. As far as I'm concerned, this is not a double album. The first disc is the \\"real\\" stadium arcadium and disc two is just a bonus disc, created for masochists that want to hurt their ears. what a pathetic, worthless disgrace.<br /><br />The ultimate lesson here is quality over quantity. I would much rather have 12 amazing tracks than 34 lackluster meh songs. The second disc is a sloppy, unlistenable mess. 5 stars for disc 1 and zero stars for disc 2.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games and skills for all ages. My daughter and I love it! The games are challenging. and fun. You will enjoy this app!_
B00785P2QC|5.0|Best game ever. So cool. Great. Fun. Virtual City Playground by G5 Entertainment is an awesome app. Best app ever.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|Dont like how the dominoes overlap on top of each other. Gets confusing to see which ones are in play
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this app starts out fun, but you keep doing the same things over and over again. it gets boring. please try and make it more interesting...
0385344228|5.0|It held my interest all the way through. It was suspenseful and the ending was unexpected but perfect! I just loved it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game was totally fun and very addicting. The game is full of a lot of cool, fun minigames. The games are all different and there is a game for everyone in this app, and it's free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is outstanding! I really don't any words in my very large vocabulary that can describe how truly great it is!<br /><br />The Twilight days are long over, and it's time for The Hunger Games trilogy to take center stage! I believe that this series will be one that will last a life time. Even 50 years from now, I think girls around the world will still be falling in love with Peeta. They will still be comparing themselves to Katniss. And they will still be wishing Gale would make more apperances.<br /><br />I know that this book is by far the best ever! It takes a very good book to become required reading in many, many schools. I found that this book was extremely hard to put down; I even read it while shopping! So just a word of caution, The Hunger Games is very addicting...<br /><br />I strongly suggest reading this book!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie.  Toby Frost (Denzel Washington) was a former CIA agent who has been gone for 10 years.  They claim he had been trading intelligence information on foreign shores.  Matthew Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a young CIA agent, stationed in a safe house in the Capetown South African area.  Matt dreams of some real action out on the field, but has no experience, and can't get experience baby-sitting a safe house. (Be careful what you wish for, Matt.)<br /><br />As Toby is being pursued by bad guys, he ducks into the US Consulate in South Africa and turns himself in.  Toby is brought to Matt's safe house and all heck breaks loose.  Toby tells Matt, \\"You are responsible for your guest.  Me, they want alive.  You, they will kill.\\"  And the story begins . . .<br /><br />Very enjoyable, car chases, shoot-em-up stuff, and lots of action while the boys are on the run.  A few twists add to the plot.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game. excellent graphics very easy to play and to read the cards<br />highly recommend for spider lovers. everywhere
B0070TEH08|5.0|I loved the first season and was enthralled the the tight script-writing, superb acting, and lavish costumes and design continued in the second installment of the beloved series. I will rewatch these episodes to tide me over until the third series begins.
B005H2IAM6|4.0|I enjoyed this re-look at Star Blazers. I was comfortable with the re-vision of the series and modifications made to the plot to fit the two hour format.  I can't give it 5 stars, I would have liked a bit more exposition for those not familiar with the original series, maybe a couple more battle scenes with the Yamato in action and a more anthropomorphic enemy.  I was also disappointed to read that there will not be an English voice over version, supposedly the lead actor dictated that his voice would not be dubbed.  Anyway, overall it was worth it for me.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is super awesome, but, just not as good as the original... but still a great game that I would recommend. The End!
B002JMLMKE|5.0|Da Vinci code is in the top 5 books I have ever read. It is both interesting and surprising.  Fiction doesn't have to be possible just believable.  Dan Brown makes the unlikely believable.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is totally awesome, and what's more, a free version!? The absoulute best! Need more words. for 20 minimum.
B004EPYZXK|5.0|I didn't actually buy this from amazon,but I have seen this on my disc from walmart.Let me just say that this is the BEST movie I have seen since twins(Arnold Schwarzzenegger).The acting is absolutely AMAZING!The effects that they have put into this movie are phenominol.I totally recommend it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|best game ever!!!!!  it is so awesome!!!! I love the game! I past 4 boxes.I think it is a great g
B006ON41FC|5.0|I really enjoy this game! Its fun trying to get farther and farther every go, and I like the upgrades/costumes! I use the skeleton suit! =^-^=
B00070Q7VO|4.0|very enjoyable, this is very easy to listen to, If you like Tony Bennett, Natalie Cole you will enjoy this CD.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|lots of fun and I love the graphics but damn things get to be impossibly hard in the second mission. this will make you want to throw your phone.
B007BLEKPM|2.0|Watching this movie was like doing homework. It crawled along at an unnecessarily sluggish pace. The actors' makeup and vocal accents were conspicuous to the point of near-cartoonish. I was not able to stay engaged for the movie's duration. I got up and took my time with a bathroom break and a snack.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|This product is not comparable with the kindle fire! I am glad this is free and i did not spend money on it because otherwise i would want a refund.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler works great for my i7 960.  My idle temps are about 28-30 C.  Full load: about 45 C.  This would make for a great OC cooler but the reason i purchased it was i wanted a quite fan that never needs to ramp up. This thing never needs to spin faster.  When i am playing AAA games with full graphics this cooler NEVER needs to increase speed of fan.  Just what I was looking for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games to choose from. Ads are a little annoying but still fun. What more can I say. Play it!
B005LL4U54|5.0|Like the film the music is from, the soundtrack from \\"The Artist\\" is a masterpiece!  It's filled with tunes that move me emotionally in so many ways.  It's high energy, gentle romance, dramatic moments, and great humor all rolled into one.  I love this CD.  There's a reason composer Ludovic Bource won the Oscar for Best Original Score.  The score is simply brilliant!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|demi put on a new sound in her music this time with the pop and club music of this album i love it listen to it everywhere i recommend to her funky fans
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The Quest mode in this game combines a little adventure with great mahjong puzzles that are suitable for all ages. The game also saves your progress so you can start right where you left off (even if you receive a phone call in the middle of a game). Very enjoyable!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great read i couldn't put it down. The book made you feel like you were right there watching.
B00009RDGA|5.0|I'm not going to tread familiar ground and repeat everything good these other reviewers have written about this movie - I cannot find fault with their comments. It's a wonderful movie in so many ways; the acting, the direction, the editing, etc.<br /><br />I do want to say this: I am not a fan of Ryan O'Neal, but I think he should have gotten an Oscar for his work in this movie. I think the perception in Hollywood that he wasn't a serious actor and just simply got by on his handsome looks really hurt his chances. In my opinion, he is superb in this film. This role was made for him and vice-versa.<br /><br />I mean, his work as an actor has been mediocre in many ways, but I have to give credit where credit is due. I think he should have gotten an Oscar for this film.
1451648537|5.0|Wow what a book. I'm not a Mac user, I don't own an iphone and only have my outdated ipod shuffle. Meaning, I've not been one to have been captivated into the iworld that Steve created, but I was still moved by this amazing bio of him. I learned that his personality was something left to be desired, something that was kept out of the media for the most part while he created his amazing impact on this world. I loved all the little tidbits about his friends and colleagues over his decades, how he made friends and enemies almost simultaneously. It just goes to show that there isn't one sure way to make an impact. This book shows that Steve Jobs had his unique way of living and that worked for him and affected the world in a huge way. The book moved me to tears. Well done and worth the read, whether you're an Apple or a Windows user.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This runs  very smoothly on my  Viewsonic Viewbook 730 tablet. I, as an adult, played it to preview for my kiddoes and, though it was easy mostly for me, it challenged the way I was thinking many times. Great app and friendly. Clean, too. Thank you.  :)
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|for all of you out there.... this games beast, and if this game for closes you always or some other crap.. well don't rate because I have a kindle fire and it works perfectly. one of the best intense apps ever I ever played wooo.ONCE AGAIN STATING.....THIS GAMES A BEAST!!!!!!!!(5 muthuf***in stars fo this joint yeah!!!) This **** is goooooder dan a bitch!!!!!!!!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Great book, It really helped us with our start up. Most is all ready out there. But it is the first book I have seen which is so hands-on and practical. Thanks!
1449305172|4.0|While this book is geared towards the true start up (small team on a new idea), the concepts and tools discussed work just as well for entrepreneurs operating in larger firms.  I work for a company with 1000 tech employees and over $1 Billion in annual revenue.  Hardly your definition of a start up.  However, all most all of the methodology espoused by the Lean Startup and the tools introduced in this book provide value in my day to day life.  These books are a must read for any and all innovators, regardless of how big your company.<br /><br />Now, regarding this specific book: it provides an excellent extension of the concepts discussed in \\"The Lean Startup\\" by Eric Ries.  I would definitely recommend starting there. This book takes presents the practical side of the Lean Startup Methodology.  Where \\"The Lean Startup\\" is more on the what and why, this book provides concrete examples of how to bring these principles to life.  It presents specific tools that can be used to practice these methods.  Mr Maurya writes with an easy to read style.  This is a quick read that does not fall short on content.<br /><br />I read this book on a 6\\" E-Ink kindle.  The text in some of the images was very difficult to read.  For that reason alone I am giving it 4 stars.  Based purely on the content, the book is a 5 star.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|I cannot imagine a better production of this gorgeous, heartbreaking opera--in terms of singing, orchestra (under Nello Santi), videography, sound, staging and production values. The sound from this live recording is so superb that it makes for an excellent listening experience even if you can't watch the wonderful performers. Moreover, I commend the other ArtHaus Musik blu-ray operas I have purchased (Traviata[[ASIN:B00361DR4Q Verdi: La Traviata Special Edition Blu-Ray - Exclusive Bonus Feature]], Tosca[[ASIN:B005G02RIC Tosca [Blu-ray]]]). The label selects beautiful, often cutting-edge productions to film, and then produces top rate (mostly blu-ray) disks. The disks all have sound and subtitle selections, as well as bonus features. The pricing is more than competitive (esp the Traviata and Tosca productions--each under 10 dollars!). This Rigoletto opera blu-ray disk sets the standard for all other opera recordings, in my humble view.
B003VI0PZI|5.0|NOT WIDESCREEN. I expected the blu-ray to be widescreen, as is described twice on this page. I don't like the picture cut off, I feel it takes away from the movie. For $39.69 I want to see it all. I am dissapointed, because I really liked this movie, and the blu-ray (transfer) looked good. If I wan't to see part of a movie, I have that capability. Amazon is sending a return label, I'll let you know what happens. So far, Amazon has always taken care of any issues I have encountered (very rare). I use Amazon quite a bit. The movie itself is is 5 stars.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Amazon did indeed take care of me and refunded my money. Kudos to them for having integrity in today's business world. I will continue to shop, shop, shop, with Amazon.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** Thanks to BuckNaked2k, I now know that it is indeed widescreen, and have updated my review to 5 stars.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a great read.  I couldn't put it down.  Although it is fiction I'm sure it's happened to some family during the holocaust.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best app.  We use YouVersion all the time and it is so easy to use. We also have it downloaded on other devices.  I've never been disappointed with this app.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun game so far. just started playing and I am amused. no problems thus far. seems pretty easy. you should try it.
B001JNNE64|5.0|Brilliantes Bild. Brillianter Ton. Deutsche Tonspur. Sehr schön aufgemacht. Mit beiliegender Musik-CD. Sollte in keiner Blu-Ray Sammlung fehlen. Für den Versand nach Deutschland müssen vier Wochen eingeplant werden.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to read the magnificient Holy Bible on my Kindle! this is a great app! it hasn't failed me, like other apps. I highly recommend it to someone looking for a Bible app.
B006H4DBA4|5.0|This was first book I downloaded from Amazon.com excellent choice, just long enough to start my experience with Kindle, I have read quite a few books by the same author, does not disappoint.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is amazing! its so much fun and the goals sound weird but are fun to do. I think everyone should play this game.
1401937519|5.0|This is an amazing book written by an even more amazing woman.  I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  So many of us are on a journey to search for life's meaning and answers to questions about earthly life and what lies ahead in the beyond.  We are all on the same path, no matter what \\"religion\\" we are taught, our destination is the same....love.  This is a book that I will definitely read more than once, actually many times.  I have it on Kindle now, but I am looking forward to buying the print version.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Being retired, nudging 70 & cutting my teeth (what's left of 'em) on games like Pong & Space Invaders at the corner arcade makes this game a total blast!  Scrolling non-stop action, dimentional graphics, challenging goals & \\"nutty\\" rewards for \\"purchase\\" in the Store make this more fun than my rockin' chair. Helps keep cobwebs outta my brain too. Wife & I both play it all day long. Why?  Cuz we can. Old farts & this game rule!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is a great book not just for startups but for companies with established products. I used the techniques in the book when adding new features to a mature product.<br /><br />The writing style is concise, to-the-point, and highly actionable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|for all u hunger games haters, idk what to say ro say to u! i mean we all have different oppinions but this is like one of the like bestest books like ever. like i hate when people like say they like hate something like i wish i could just say like if u like dont have anything like nice to say like just like keep it in your head. like yeah........... like the hunger games made me so like happy that j like started like cryjng and i like through down the book when it was sad like. and kids dont try o like brek your hnd with a hammer like cause than like the doctor can like  see it theough an x ray like than youll like go to a hospital.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I LOVE Bob Dylan!!!!!<br />I very much enjoy listening to other artists interpret Freewheelin' Bob's songs...but who thought a light weight like kEsHA would be a good fit? My GOD!!!! You just kinda wasted my precious time, why didn't someone think twice!? It's not alright!!!!<br />Aside from qualifing as the hottest scank from a small Central Florida trailor park soon to appear on America's Most Wanted; this overproduced, overhyped nothing has garnered zero merit...and they INVITE her to BUTCHER a truly wonderful song. Face facts; this girl can't sing! There are many very nice covers here but avoid track 19 on cd3 at all costs. It is soooooo UN-DYLAN I almost hurled! In ten years; when this package ages, folks hearing it for the first time will exclaim, \\"Oh, that's where the phrase, 'piece of ke$ha' comes from!\\"<br />And to the little no talent puke that shall no longer be named...please have a tall glass of Drano with your next dose of pills and \\"say fare thee well, don't think twice, it's alright!\\" and pass writhing \\"into that good night.\\" (forgive me Dylan & Dylan)
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I read this wonderfully written book some years ago, but had to have it on my phone. Neil Gaiman's writing is always a pleasure. Usually, I do not crave two book sets or trilogies. To the extent that Gaiman's Anansi Boys can be considered the second half of the set, and some may beg to dispute this, this book cries for a second (or third) book about the characters. Read it, enjoy it and buy other Gaiman books for your reading pleasure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A little cumbersome at times and slow to load. I've gotten good use out of it though, now I hope they make a Q'uron and Torah - forgive me if I mispelt those - app available. It is very cool overall.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|After reading Book 1 I couldn't believe that anything could grab my imagination and hold me enthralled as much as the first book did.  I was wrong.  The second book in the series, A CLASH OF KINGS: A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, did just that.  I couldn't put it down and was immediately drawn into the story and found myself thinking nonstop about the characters and their plight.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, adventure and wonderful characters.  I can't wait to start Book 3.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app.  Now I don't have to walk around with my notebook the day before a test when I'm at work or worry about losing it. I also like how I can use my phone, kindle, or a desktop computer when I need to access it.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|Had a hard time tracking this movie down, and the DVD was just as advertised. Thanks for the great sale and product!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|All I can tell you is, once you watch this show, you will be changed! The characters are simply the most complex, multidimensional and layered ever! Nothing on tv, has ever been this good! Period. I watched The X-Flies, Lost, and The Wire, etc, but this simply leaves them all (and I thought The Wire was the best series, that is until I watched Breaking Bad)! You can't help but indentify with Walt, but then you find yourself feeling emotional turmoil because you stop feeling sorry for him as you see and come to grips that there is something else inside of him and you realize that you never really knew him at all. Not to worry, because Gustavo Fring (aka Chicken Man) takes bad guy to a whole another level! \\"There is crime and there is Crime!\\" And there are criminals and then there are Criminals! Gus is the ultimate criminal kingpin! He is brilliant, reasonable and pragmatic, but he is also ruthless, soulless and a sociopath - talk about your duality of man! I literally can't wait to for Season Four to ship - I know it's going to be so worth the wait!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Fits perfectly and feels great. All ports are accessible, looks very good. It was easy to install. I have something similar on my Kindle and iPad 2. Doesn't add bulk so it still slides into my shirt pocket just fine. It also will allow the phone to stand up on end.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|VERY fun, a bit repetitive, but then again gives the old game a new twist while still keeping its roots. Love it!<br /><br />Motorola Droid X2
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games to chose from but you do have to earn points to buy more games but they range in difficulty.so that's.a plus:)
B003IPY4SI|5.0|This is probably my favorite album I've run across in the last several years. Her voice, the timing, the lyrics, everything. Sincerely a fantastic CD, and I eagerly await more from her in the future!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|If you've ever seen the movie, \\"Point Blank\\" with Lee Marvin (which you probably haven't, poor you), you're familiar with the wronged agent/criminal/whatever seeking recompense from the baddies. Granted, it is a simple formula, but because it is so straightforward, it is difficult to pull off, much less with the style that Steven Soderbergh so gracefully stamps \\"Haywire\\" with.<br /><br />Perhaps too generic a title, \\"Haywire\\" still is a feat that is hard to achieve - an action movie solely devoted to one character seeking revenge on another (or others), and yet being appealing in its atmosphere and storyline. \\"Haywire\\" is lush in location detail, efficient in its storytelling, and not insulting to its audience.<br /><br />Big-screen newcomer Gina Carano is actually quite good as the protagonist out to right the wrong done to her. There is never a dull or predictable moment in this hard-driving story, yet the humanity is not lost in the shuffle. The performances are solid throughout with no duds in the mix (not even Channing Tatum!). Who does our feminine, but take-it-to-the-mat heroine need to dispatch with next? That question would normally fall into cliche, but in this film's case, it literally is a you-don't-know who to trust game that she must discern correctly.<br /><br />What makes this film especially fun is the creative angles and shots cinematographer-for-life Soderbergh takes. There is not a wasted opportunity to make an old estate look beautiful, backed with a distance-shot of a full-speed Gina Carano closing in to jump onto an adversary and into the audience's direct vision.<br /><br />This is a creative, illuminating, and original film which got sorely overlooked by the ticket-buying public. It is well worth the price of admission: an entertaining and engaging ride through a world which looks new, yet familiar under the steady hand of the director. Well worth a look for the entertainment value, and alone for the beautiful way in which it was shot. Thisis not your run-of-the-mill shot-em-up: this not only has emotional heft, it's got style, baby.
0375507256|3.0|Some of the six narratives could have stood on their own as novels.  I can't help but think that Mitchell had six short stories that seemed convenient to combine into one novel while connecting them with the barest of threads.  I was looking forward to the connections but instead was subjected to an author intent on exhibiting command of different writing styles.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Based upon the book by Dr. Seuss (whose name is officially part of the title), THE LORAX has been contemporized a bit making it accessible to not only super-environmental-types, but to those who were raised upon conservation and not environmentalism. In THE LORAX, Ted (Zac Efron) is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in the plasticized, walled city of Thneedville. Ted is in love with a teenage girl named Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey doesn't quite fit in Thneedville and paints the back of her house full of colorful trees which no longer exist. She longs to see a real tree and Ted becomes determined to find one for her. During dinner one night, Ted's Grammy Norma (Betty White) tells Ted that in order to find out what happened to the trees and if there's another one to be found, he needs to speak with the Once-ler (Ed Helms) who lives outside the city walls. Ted has never been outside the city, but sets out on a mission to meet the Once-ler and find a tree. He succeeds in finding the creature on the edge of town and the Once-ler tells Ted his story of how he started life off as an industrious, young man with a heart who just wanted to be a success, how he found a valley of paradise, and how he met The Lorax (Danny Devito). Before the story is through, the Once-ler's tale will merge with Ted's and perhaps revive the valley again.<br /><br />Visually, THE LORAX is stunning. Both the natural beauty of the paradise valley and the plastic artificiality of Thneedville are full of bright and beautiful colors. These are contrasted by the present day greys of the world outside of Thneedville, the world that the Once-ler created.<br /><br />The story stays fairly close to Dr. Seuss' original tale. However, there are a few differences. The Once-ler isn't a creature that's only seen by his hands, but instead has been transformed into a thin and tall man. When we first see the young Once-ler, there are distinct feelings of sympathy for him and empathy with his plight. It's hard to believe this industrious man will be responsible for cutting down all the Truffula Trees, but the temptations of family and fortune are strong. There are a couple of scenes in the forest that are added to pad the story. Also, instead of leaving at different times, the animals of the forest leave together in a mass exodus. Personally, I thought this element weakened the story.<br /><br />Like the book, there is a strong conservationist message to THE LORAX, but I didn't see any anti-capitalistic undertones. The Once-ler is \\"punished\\" not because he was industrious and wanted to earn a living, but because he gave in to greed and destroyed the very thing that was allowing him to earn a living. Mr. O'Hare, the Mayor of Thneedville isn't a villain because he's a businessman, but because he's manufactured his fortune based upon a lie and even when confronted with the truth, he refuses to concede.<br /><br />There's a lot of music in THE LORAX that comes in a variety of styles, folk, rock-a-billy, and some Broadway-type showtunes. Personally, I liked the smaller numbers which are mostly sung by the Once-ler (Ed Helms).<br /><br />THE LORAX has broad appeal. It's a film that kids will enjoy for the characters and bright scenery, while many adults will enjoy for some of the subtle bits of humor. The mass consumerism message isn't as blatant as in WALL-E, but it's still there. Overall, it's a movie that The Lorax himself would probably enjoy watching.lieve this industrious man will be responsible for cutting down all the Truffula Trees, but the temptations of family and fortune are strong.

B001NLKT60|5.0|A wonderful story line that is ultimately about violence toward women.  it's Pipi Longstocking grown up, with all the neuroses you would expect from a neglected childhood, but with a strong sense of what is is ethical.  Engrossing until the last word.
B006O5YI7G|4.0|I can see by some of the other reviews, that you either like this film or you don't.  I fall into the first group, I liked it and found it engaging.  The beauty of being able to stream movies is that you can stumble upon surprises that you may have otherwise passed on.  That was certainly the case here.  I enjoy westerns, but wasn't so sure about this one. Once I started watching it, I was surprised to be so engaged in the story.  The scenery was beautiful, the story plausible, with just enough action to give it an edge.<br /><br />The cast was perfect for this film, and as for the the ending.... it left me wanting a bit more.<br /><br />Nicely done.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I hope they make a cut the rope 2. hurry and buy this game while it is free . u won't regret it.
B004QL7K6Q|4.0|I was reading snippets from numerous critics about this movie after watching it and I was surprised to find several panning it because it wasn't funny.  I get the fact that some people could be offended by the language, \\"sexy talk\\" and plenty-o-nudity but not funny?  Then I remembered how much I hated \\"Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie.\\"<br /><br />As I think back a few hours about this movie I would argue that it might be just another comedy if not for the brilliance and comedic genius of Paul Rudd.  Yes, Jennifer Aniston seems to get more beautiful as she gets older and yes, she has her moments (including one involving pixilated boobs) but this is Rudd's movie.  He plays George and is married to Linda (Aniston).  They live in New York City.  After several unsuccessful career moves, Linda makes a pitch to HBO to show a documentary she produced about testicular cancer in penguins.  Pretty funny concept right there.  She's turned down.<br /><br />George is a successful business executive in the financial sector.  As the CEO of his firm is perp-walked away in handcuffs for some form of SEC malfeasance, George loses his job.  All of this comes the day after they movie into their brand new micro-loft studio apartment.  In route to Atlanta in their aging Honda, where George's brother Rick (co-writer Ken Marino) has promised a job, they stumble upon a bed and breakfast where they hope to stay for the night.  Located in northern Georgia, it is actually a commune community where characters of all stripes are in residence.  In spite of their differences, George and Linda enjoy their stay but must move on to Atlanta.<br /><br />After a night or two in Rick and Marisa's (Michaela Watkins) suburban home, they've had enough (Rick is an A-hole and Marisa is always drunk or drugged) and head back to the commune.  While, the comedy is a bit uneven at times, Rudd manages to rescue every scene he's in.  In one of the funniest bits I've ever seen, George readies himself for a sexual liaison with Eva (Malin Akerman).  Even with his wife's blessing, George has second thoughts so tries to pump himself up in front of a mirror.  He goes through several minutes of clearly unscripted riffs about how he's going to perform.  Using one clich&eacute;d macho term after another, I couldn't stop laughing.  It continues when he gets to the bedroom and actually confronts Eva.  He promises what she is going to experience which goes on until she is no longer interested.  I imagine this scene took forever to shoot and how Akerman kept a straight face is amazing itself.<br /><br />This movie is not for the prudish.  It includes full frontal nudity, some of which you really don't want to see (aging nudists running!), crude banter (sexual and otherwise) and some disgusting remnants of childbirth.

B006ZNRD06|1.0|Ditto with all Kindle Fire reviews. PLUS any attempt to use other functions (i.e. changing default settings) ends with a crash of your KF device, and a SD card scan for errors or damage. I DON'T recommend this on KF.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|FUN game! Glad to have it on the kindle. Love all the story games! They keep going and going and going.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is the best and i give it 5 stars!!!!!! i have not had any problems. with this app and i hope i never will!!!!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|This game would be okay if it weren't for the fact that you have to wait several hours just to make one thing and you end up not having anything else to do... unless you want to fork over REAL money. It is also kind of ridiculous to even revolve your life around this game to even keep up with the things you make less you want rotten food on the stove. The game is a good idea but poorly executed.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|What I thought I couldn't do with my Kindle Fire is now possible.  So glad I didn't waste $300+ on that other product, this $200 investment does everything I need it to!
0307269965|5.0|Brideshead revisited is funny, it's characters are charming and intriguing, and the love story is so real it hurts. I've recommended this book to everyone I know and am getting ready to read it again. I could not put it down! I haven't read anything else by E.W. yet, but if this book is any indication, he may become my favorite author.

B000AMPZF8|4.0|This is my first exposure to Muse. I'm a punk rock expatriate (Nirvana, Wipers, and Mudhoney, to give you an idea), so I admit I felt a tad out of place when I started listening to this. But I've heard a lot about Muse, so I decided to give them a shot. And I was not dissapointed.<br /><br />I listened to the track from beginning to end (including the bonus track Futurism), and I was hooked from the start. NEW BORN does a great job mixing soft piano segments with a more intense, guitar-driven chorus. My personal favorite song off of this album was HYPER MUSIC and the opening riff for CITIZEN ERASED (I could almost hear the Nirvana influence in it, and since Matthew Bellamy has listed Nirvana as one of his favorite bands, I might not be far off the mark).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album with plenty of songs to jam to. Recommended thoroughly!
6304708521|2.0|It's a shame, that this historical little film is languishing in people's collections, in poor copies such as these. I knew when I ordered this film that it would be some fourth, seventh who knows how many generation copy of most probably a vhs copy from the 80's. The two stars I have given this are merely for the music.I love The Beatles and everything they recorded or filmed, and it really pisses me off as to how Apple can allow this film to be remembered this way.Fans such as I know there is an original negative in existence, because we saw the virtually pristine footage of this film in the Beatles Anthology.Come on Apple, chop, chop, the fans deserve it..No actually the world deserves it!!
B0000CAXID|5.0|I'm a Nirvana fan who just recently introduced himself to Foo Fighters, and I gotta say, this album is AMAZING. From track 1 to 12, this is pure, unadulterated rock. Dave Grohl's worked really hard to get out of Nirvana's shadow, and with stuff like this, I think he's earned all the fame he's gotten with the Foos.<br /><br />THIS IS A CALL and GOOD GRIEF are my favorites on this album, because, simply put, they're catchy rock songs that you can sing along and work out to. I've yet to listen to any other Foo Fighters albums, but if they're anything like this one, I definitely won't be disappointed. A great rock album from start to finish. 5 stars!
B0058VW36U|4.0|My 6 year old playes this game by himself and my 3 year old and I play together.  Lots of fun and definitely worth the 99 cents.

1898929246|5.0|I lived in London for a year and found this book to be invaluable.  I stumbled upon it for sale by a street vendor there.  It is the most user-friendly, intuitive guidebook that I have ever found.  I like it much better than the A-Z guide and would highly recommend that Amazon stock the book for sale in the U.S.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The book was an excellent read, I am always leery of a book based movie. The acting was superb and the portrayal of the white women's treatment of the \\"colored\\" help was really well done. Loved it, would watch it again.
1933633867|4.0|This was one of the most fun reads I've done in a long time.  Open the book at random and enjoy the stimulating thoughts and entertaining writing style.  Great fun!
B0065GC0PG|4.0|I'm rounding up this one, because despite all the things that didn't make sense-also known as world building glitches-one thing this book isn't is the great book of meh.<br /><br />Many years from now, when humans have colonised the Moon, fought and killed each other in two more world wars and built something on the ruins, an old fairy tale comes to life.<br /><br />She awakens with mechanical spare parts and a second class citizenship in the Eastern Commonwealth with a snarky androids helping her to clean up the castle, a mad scientist as a godfather, two stepsisters and a stepmother with a grudge. She's Cinder without the Ella.<br /><br />Anyone and everyone who knows the classic tale knows how this story will end, but this is a case of how it's done not of what is done. This re-imagination of Cinderella actually works. There are all the classic characters in their new costumes, there's an evil Queen and there's a ball where all secrets are revealed. Despite the lack of mystery, the writing grabs you, sucks you in and won't let go until you've reached the last pages and curse.<br /><br />How in the world could this turn out to be a trilogy? There isn't enough of story in a fairytale to fill one standard length novel, let alone three.<br /><br />Yes, Marissa Meyer took the frame of an age-old story, but that's not all she did. She built a rich world around it and created a full picture, and made the story hers. She gave Cinder a personality most YA heroines unfortunately lack, because even at her worst moments of survivor's guilt Cinder chooses to fight.<br /><br />Meyer also gave the Prince a personality. No, he's not just a pretty figure to sweep Cinder of her feet, he's a son mourning for his father, struggling to carry the responsibility of his land and coming up short. He's not ready to be the Emperor, yet he must.<br /><br />This isn't just about the girl finding and falling in love with a prince-although that too happens and there's actually a build-up for it-this is about a girl fighting for her right to live her life and choose for herself. It's about being free of slavery. It's about the sanctity of a human body. For a woman living in this day and age with government mandated rapes and abortions-just to mention two-it's a painfully relevant message.<br /><br />So, forgive me for ignoring the reflective surfaces, un-disconnected netlinks, and convenient memory-losses especially when it's a question of security.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing! they have many games to play and you earn points to unlock other games. it is cool that you can earn points, but also if you wanted pay for the points with money. they also give you little bonuses as you go through the app. I reccomend this app. my favorite game is tornado alley. p.s. sometimes little adds pop up, but the game still plays fine. you just have to click out of the adds:-)

1451627289|1.0|I've never been able to read Stephen King. But based on reviews, this is supposed to be a great novel. His writing is so superficial, I just couldn't get pass the first pages.

B002CGSYNU|5.0|This lens cap is for the Mark I micro 4/3 Olympus 14-42.  The filter is 40.5 mm.  In fact, any 40.5mm lens cap will fit on this lens.<br /><br />It will not fit on a Mark II micro 4/3 Olympus 14-42 lens.  That filter size is 37mm.  Any 37mm lens cap will fit on the Mark II.<br />It will not fit on the 4/3 Olympus 14-42 lens.  The filter size there is 58mm.  Again, any 58mm lens cap will fit.<br /><br />Moral of the story, when you're looking for a lens cap, look at the filter size, not the name of the lens.  The filter size is all that matters, and when there is more than one version of a lens, screw ups happen.
0811875040|4.0|I live in San Francisco about a block away from the Miette shop, and when I found out they would be releasing a cookbook I was thrilled. I've only made the double chocolate cupcakes and the gingerbread cupcakes so far, but both those recipes were hugely successful. I would say the recipes produced the best of either I have ever tasted. The recipes are a little fussier than average, but that made them fun, and the results were totally worth it. Contrary to what many reviewers have said, I found the instructions to be detailed and easy to follow. I'm not a professional baker, so until I read all these nasty reviews I would never have noticed the different conversion factors. I just used the measurements given, and everything turned out great!<br /><br /> The one complaint I do agree with is that some of the recipes call for small quantities of ingredients that come from recipes made in large batches. I had to go back to my Joy of Cooking to make chocolate buttercream frosting because Miette's version calls for the use of a bit of already-made chocolate ganache frosting. Great if you work in a bakery and always have it around, but not practical for the home kitchen.<br /><br />Strangely, I did look up the errata page online and found only 4 or 5 of the mistakes in my copy of the book.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|This movie is a travesty. Literally it is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. You would have to be born without a working brain to enjoy this. I loved the original it had a great story great casting as many have said it strayed from the r e Howard books but it was still a great movie. This new piece of garbage has none of these redeeming qualities and the only role I can think Jason mamoa would be good in is as one of the daughters on the cosby show as he is an ugly woman with a Jerry curl. Avoid this despise this and if anyone says they like it punch them in the face.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I dont like the fact that it requires you to keep paying money to get stuff in the game such as decorations.  also don't like the incessant waiting for the 'food' to be prepared.  It also seems to have a bug where it took coins away for no apparent reason.

B0042L78MG|5.0|Caro Emerald topped charts in her home Netherlands and some other European countries but it is surprising that she has not made it (yet) to a worldwide audience. Her voice is  fantastic and is not (like in many cases) a product of \\"studio engineering\\" as her live performances (check out in her website the CD she recorded live) and \\"acapella\\" versions (google for them) clearly show.

B005HMHPGI|5.0|This Blu ray set of the classic Jimmy Stewart/Donna Reed film is great. The Blu ray quality is excellent with deep blacks and clear separation of shades in between which is important for a black and white film.<br /><br />The packaging is nicely done and the silver bell ornament is a fun touch. Only thing while Amazon usually gets it right, they had to replace this as the first sets box was crushed a bit.
0743437497|4.0|I grew up hearing how great a writer Stephen King was. I have a lot in common w/ him. I'm an English teacher and found a lot of refuge in books and the reading life. I have wanted to be an author since I was a book worm kid so I always approached the King books and movies from a reverent position. This year I decided to read classics I'd grown up hearing about.<br /><br />The Shining is great. IMO the horror genre is broken into 2 pieces. Either there is a real tangible monster who is running around attacking people from which said people could take arms and defend themselves (i.e. the mad slasher movie who easily kills victims who are weaker or more frail than himself) or<br />2 the horror is pyschological. The fear coming from one's own psyche, mind, fears, inadequacies, past sins of omission or sins of commision. The torment a person feels from within is often greater than physical pain and inescapable.<br />This writer understands that. The Shining is not really about a haunted house. Actually I think the \\"ghost\\" story is a bit contrived or lacking. I doubt a phantasmagoric entity can bring a physical object into your presence. Instead the ghost being can aggravate an existing mental anxiety that will then cause the person harm.<br />(OK I'm not an expert of paranormal phenomenom but indulge me.)<br />So here is where the strength of the book lies.<br />The characters are damaged and they enter into an area where awful things have happened. The spirits of the dead have left their mark and woe unto anyone suggestible enough to believe what they have been told.<br />The book is a little long; perhaps in order to fully develope the background of the story. I guess when a reader signs on for a novel he can not then complain of the length of that ride.<br />I still plan on being an author and now I am more encouraged to begin this career. I am fighting the urge to first read all of the King books before I start writing; that would be a pleasant excuse! LOL!

B00004VWA7|5.0|Jazz fusion had been a big subject for debate long before the days of Jaco here. At the same time he was coming along at a time where their was a possibility,whether writers and critics liked it or not that the relatively new genre might just expand the musical language within jazz itself. I realize that's a controversial statement that may stand up to some heated debate even today.  After a strong musical kinship with Pat Methany and an encounter with Blood Sweat & Tears' Bobby Colomby,he was signed to Columbia records in 1975. While there he began making this album surrounded by a group of musical kindred spirits almost too long to list. Everyone from Herbie HancockWayne Shorter,Lenny White,David Sanborn,The Brecker Brothers and than up and comer Narada Michael Walden appeared on this album.  Even at this early stage Jaco Pastorious always possesed this tremendous energy that could express itself both loudly and quietly. You didn't even have to be a musical expert to appreciate his abilities. But that certainly didn't hurt either. The most wonderful thing about it,even with all these people the focus remained squarely on Jaco and what he did.<br /><br />  And just what did he do?Well I am sure there are music scholars who could explain it technically better than I could. But basically he took the ideas of funk and world fusion and turned them on their heads by using the bass not as a lead or backround instrument but rather as a cusion like thread. We start out with the bass solo on the Miles David/Charlie Parker associated \\"Donna Lee\\",given a think funk groove into a full heavy mid 70's funk sound with Sam & Dave on \\"Come Over,Come Over\\". After that the album takes on some amazing directions. \\"Continuum\\" as well another bass solo \\"Portrait of Tracy\\" both showcase Jaco's feeling for brooding understatement,the former featuring the backup musicians playing in a manner not disimilar to what Miles once did on his [[ASIN:B00006GO9Q In a Silent Way]]. The heavily string orchestrated graft of Jaco's \\"Kuru\\" and Hancock's own standard \\"Speak Like A Child\\" showcased the two musicians playing in a very potent ensamble style. \\"Opus Pocus\\",\\"Okonkole Y Trompa\\" and \\"(Used To Be A) Cha-Cha\\" are all extended polyrhythmic afro latin jazz-funk explosions with Jaco using the compositions as virtual obsitical courses-playing over,under and around the notes at every chance he got.<br /><br />  Closing the original album is Herbie's laregly solo piano piece \\"Forgotton Love\\". The bonuses here are a subtly different alternate take on \\"Cha-Cha\\" and the frantic \\"6/4 Jam\\",where Jaco repeats this powerful melodic phrase and keeps it on the one while the percussion builds to a heated frenzy. Yes this is very much a musicians album. But somehow it isn't all about in your face solos either. The way Jaco was reinventing the langauge of jazz bass playing here was very interesting. Generally before this most bass players usually were very annonymous,acted more as composers or came out in your face with their rhythm upfront. Jaco's style of bass playing was flashy and flamboyant. But in terms of the way he used his sound it slithered into the arrangements in a manner where one phrase and improvisation could literally spin off into another at almost a moments notice. It was not only Jaco's  rippling fretless electric bass sound that was his musical distinction. It was the way in which he played the instrument as well. And with the presense of Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter,both musicans noted as much for compositional method as much as if not more than the instrumental sound they had,Jaco got his start as a recording artist right in his element.orchestrated graft of Jaco's \\"Kuru\\" and Hancock's own standard \\"Speak Like A Child\\" showcased the two musicians playing in a very potent ensamble style. \\"Opus Pocus\\",\\"Okonkole Y Trompa\\" and \\"(Used To Be A) Cha-Cha\\" are all extended polyrhythmic afro latin jazz-funk explosions with Jaco using the compositions as virtual obsitical courses-playing over,under and around the notes at every chance he got.<br /><br />  Closing the original album is Herbie's laregly solo piano piece \\"Forgotton Love\\".

1594744769|5.0|I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this inventive, imaginative book.  The amount of thought which went into even the smallest detail was a thrill to see in these times when so many books seem to be simply thrown together.  The colors and designs chosen for the pages which precede every chapter and then to have the color continue with the borders of the pages featuring the photographs made the entire project come together and result in a cohesive, well produced book.  The photographs themselves are wonderful and I can imagine the fun and excitement people had in discovering such interesting old pictures and sharing them with this author.<br /><br />The story within the covers absolutely lived up to all the effort put into catching the reader's attention.  It would not matter at all how good the book presentation itself was if the story could not capture the heart and mind of those reading it.  Ransom Riggs has written a story about people who are *peculiar*.  Surely everybody has known someone who was a little different, a little unusual.  This story presents the world through the eyes of these peculiars and lets us all see what it looks like from their perspective.  These characters though had an added ability which truly made them different.  Yes, this is a fantasy story, but it is also just the tiniest bit realistic enough to make you sit back and wonder if such happenings might be possible.  I enjoyed getting to know all the principal characters and even those who stayed more in the background were people I want to meet again in another book.  Riggs has left his characters afloat in the ocean on a journey to a time they aren't sure about and a destination they don't know yet.  In the background are the ships of the war that is raging in 1940.  I really can't wait for the next installment in this journey.  Always remembering that now that the children have left the safety of their time loop they will begin to age.  Riggs has almost unlimited opportunities for where he wants this series to go because he probably has quite a large selection of photographs to chose from.  I'll be waiting to see what he comes up with next.ted opportunities for where he wants this series to go because he probably has quite a large selection of photographs to chose from.

030788743X|4.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" is set in the 2040s. The world has become a grim and poverty-stricken place. Most people are educated in, socialize in, and often work in a pervasive virtual reality named OASIS. The brainchild of introverted supergeek James Halliday, OASIS is blend of an MMO video game and a world that is often more real to the characters than the one they live in.<br /><br />When he died, Halliday's will left his fortune - and control of OASIS - to whoever uncovered an easter egg he had hidden somewhere within the vast universes of OASIS. Finding the egg involves finding three hidden keys, and only a cryptic riddle was given as a starting hint. Since Halliday was known to be obsessed with the culture of his youth, the 2040s becomes intensely interested in the pop culture of the 1980s. Many thousands go back and forth between searching OASIS and scouring old TV, movies, and games looking for the clues to decipher Halliday's puzzle. As the years passed, the general public lost interest - until suddenly the leaderboard showed someone named \\"Parzival\\" had found the first key.<br /><br />Parzival is the online avatar of Wade Watts, a broke eighteen year old living in a Midwestern trailer park. He's spent years studying Halliday arcana and has high hopes of finding the egg. He's far from alone, though. In addition to many loners like him, there are clans of allied gamers also seeking the keys. More powerful than all of them, though, is IOI - an evil corporation determined to find the egg so they can control and monetize OASIS.<br /><br />Luckily for Wade, he's avoided creating links between himself and Parzival. The scale of the reward means Parzival is suddenly world famous... and the target of everything from celebrity followers to murder.<br /><br />The rest of the book is about Wade's quest to uncover the remaining keys and find the egg. It's even more about his state of mind and his relationships. His oldest friend is Aitch, another solo egg-hunter. Their friendship becomes strained, though, when Wade starts to fall for Art3mis who's probably his closest rival. There's a big question of how much you can count on friendship or even love when absolutely everything about the other person might be a lie. This matters on a more than personal level since IOI seems to have no qualms about spying on and even killing its opponents.<br /><br />After a slightly dry start (stick with the book until Wade's got the first key - it picks up), I found the book charming. Wade is a very likable character, and I also liked the slowly revealed history of Hallidy. I also liked the dichotomy of a lot of people being very serious about playing a very quirky game.<br /><br />The book is filled with Gen X cultural references (sometimes even a few too many). It also does a solid job of creating a \\"real\\" world that pervasively filled with video game mechanics. I don't how well it would read for someone significantly older or younger than a Gen Xer, but for someone my age its a nostalgic romp along with a very enjoyable story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its great the only thing I don't like is that some games are hard I reccomend it even though great
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Avast has two big issues on Kindle Fire.<br />1. Fails to update the virus database so when you scan the device it reports problems with every app you have installed.<br />2. The app rename feature that is supposed to obfuscate the presence of the app to prevent malicious software from attacking it does not work.  After using the rename feature the app would crash each time I launched it.  It reported that the signatures did not match.<br /><br />Avast is a great product on my HTC Evo but they've got some work to do on it before it is ready for the Fire.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|The 2000 edition of the movie should be enough for me. The difference between this latter version and the 1978 version is only a few minutes, but I always watch the longer version. The additional stuff on the making of this movie is great. I do consider the TV episode on Superman quite boring ( we can't see him fly) and its Clark Kent isn't clumsy or shy either. I do enjoy over and over the cartoon episodes from the 1940s, which have great quality artwork and action-packed plots. Of course, they follow the same plot structure: Lois Lane gets in trouble and Superman saves her, but each episode is fun to watch, and they are in good condition. There is only one episode that seems to need some restoration in a few of its scenes. Also, considering the price offered for this collection, you get a lot out of it, even though it's only about one movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its okay, but only because it is free. Some games are not worth your effort but you're forced to play them in order to open others.  Still, it was free...so enjoy it for that.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Good and handy app to have. Find myself using it more and more everyday. Love using it for family outings and vacations.
B005599XJK|1.0|The other reviewers must not be familiar with the actual book. It should have been renamed and properly titled as \\"based on Orlando by Virginia Woolf.\\" With each cliche liberty Potter took with the storyline my stomach churned a little more. The costumes are nice at least. My feeling is that this was an oportunity to create a masterpiece and they screwed the pooch. I would like to smack the director for Mrs. Woolf's honor if I could.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very entertaining for a free app. games are more challenging than I thought but not impossible to complete. a lot of variety
B00064X282|5.0|This is a great-sounding SACD! It is NOT, however, the Deluxe Edition, as it doesn't have the 2nd CD with the live tracks (see editor's notes above). That said, I'm still glad I bought it, and for a reasonable price for this SACD version. If you're into SACD, get it before it is either out-of-print or otherwise unavailable (or really expensive). Absolutely one of EC's best, if not THE best!
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Super fun blend of action, comedy, sci-fi, and western with charismatic cast, strong acting, developed characters, and explored relationships. Unlike some similar movies/series, I find this feels believable - it looks realistic and doesn't feel superficial or silly where it shouldn't be. The show's got depth and a very cool follow-up movie. One of my favorite tv series - this was my second viewing.

B000JQU4TW|5.0|A fascinating look into the human ego and basic selfishness,this story could as easily have been written regarding our society as that of 1890s England.  The only rough spot is chapter 11, which can easily be skimmed over.  My best guess is that it all would have been fascinating to Wildes contemporaries, but is somewhat meaningless in this age.

1416955070|4.0|This book took me on a bit of a roller coaster ride. The story was original, maybe even crazy original. It follows Clary, a 15 year old seemingly ordinary girl, as her whole world gets turned upside down, starting when she meets Jace and his friends at a club.<br /><br />I have kind of mixed thoughts about this book. I'll start with saying that this is my first book by Cassandra Clare, and though I had heard mixed reviews, I was thoroughly impressed. Her writing style flows and makes the book an easy read, all 490ish pages of it. The story, however, started a little slow for me, and took me a while to get into. Fortunately, all of that was absolved in the last 120 or so pages, when I literally just couldn't put the book down. There were so many twists and turns that I couldn't help but keep making guesses as I read. One of my greatest disappointments was the fact that I guessed one of the biggest twists. Though I did have to go back and forth on my ideas as there are plenty of places my guesses were tripped up.<br /><br />On to the characters. One of the problems I had was that it felt like they were all the same person. I love the snarky, sarcastic characters, but when ALL of the characters are snarky and sarcastic, its a little too much. But I did love them all anyways.<br /><br />Clary - Not the strongest heroine, but she did just fall into this world without warning. She's not a hero, but she's also not a clumbsy, ditsy girl. I'm hoping to watch her grow as the series progresses.<br /><br />Simon - Clary's best friend since forever. He's the cute, cool nerd. He's got the dorky glasses going on, but is also in a band. I swoon for the smart, dorky boys. I was totally team Simon throughout the book.<br /><br />Jace - He's our hero. He's cool, cocky, sarcastic, and standoffish. Oh, and of course hot. He's supposed to be the ultimate bad boy, but to me it seemed like he was just trying too hard. But still, hot is hot, right? ;-)<br /><br />I also loved the supportingcharacters: Isabelle, Alec, and even Luke. I really had a soft spot for Luke.<br /><br />Overall I liked this book a lot more than most 1st book in a series books. I will definitely be picking up the next one soon, so expect to see that review within the next few weeks.

B007BLDFWG|2.0|This might have been a good movie if it the whole story was shown.  As it is, the story is very slow to develop and there is not much character or plot development.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|You can watch this for free on Pbs.com, save some money. I watched both of the downtown abbey seasons there on my kindle fire.
0439023513|2.0|I realize the last book is about the revolution but really? Killing off hundreds of innocent children and toddlers? Climbing over bodies, slipping in pools of blood, bombing hospitals? The fantasy-genre of the deaths in the arena are one thing but when so much of the end of the book deals with the slaughter of the citizenry, my interest flagged and it was a chore to look for something positive in the final chapters.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Seriously THE best album I have EVER heard in my entire life. It arrived just on time, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since. <3
B000002LQR|5.0|Back when this album was new, it was my introduction to the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I liked it before I was a guitarist.  And, though I can't say that I've been with them since the beginning, I can say, I have been a fan of theirs for many years by now.  It turned out for the most part I liked their earlier stuff too!  Few bassists have ever rocked as hard as Flea.  I would call him a virtuoso.  I would even recommend this to a person that likes sophisticated music.  Now, that wouldn't make me popular, but there is no way around it; Blood Sugar Sex Magic is a great funky album.  As with the albums I give 5 stars, every song has to be more than just good, and that is the case with this album.  It is one of the best that the 90s had to offer.  I would definitely in the top 10 pop rock albums of the 90s.  To the young kid that might get this today:  If you had a rockin' dad, then he probably listened to this album as a youngster.  Hope you enjoy it too!
B0000027RL|5.0|I love this album now every bit as much as I did when it came out in 8th grade.  I love every song on it.  And, I won't let it bother me that Pearl Jam got as popular as they did.  The songs on this album identified with the pauper, and not so much the rich man.  Before Ten was released it was unknown how good it would sell, so it's not as Eddie is singing down to the poor folk.  When the album was written, in all probability Pearl Jam would end up that way.  In music, popularity is very comparable to a roll of the dice.  The odds are not in your favor.  So, Eddie became an advocate for the success of the underdog in life, and his band turned out to be a success.  I can't think of many instances where that has happened.  Most of time pop music is about and for rich kids that get everything handed to them.  Sure, there are tons of songs out there about drugs and junk, but this album is not about that, it is more about trying to promote justice on earth.  I don't believe Pearl Jam was ever able to rock as hard after this album.  The secret of this album is that not only is it instantly recognizable, but the lyrics, and song delivery come across as if Pearl Jam is out to play more than a song.  They have a message.  It is a priestly message, and they took a huge risk that people wouldn't want to hear about, poor folk, abused folk, people with personality disorders etc., in an empathetic way.  As far as rock that charted, I would definitely put Ten in my top 10 albums of the 1990s.
B004A7OQKY|5.0|This is one of the BEST prenatal workouts! It makes me feel my muscles with out feeling I've over done it. At the same time I also get a good sweat.  I'm glad I ordered this one!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I loved the book! I can't wait to read the second one. I couldn't stop reading the book from the moment I started it.
0553593544|2.0|I just want to say that this book opens very well. The main character suffers from amnesia, but when thrown into some crazy situations, he begins to discover his instictive talents. He speaks multiple languages, knows martial arts... Each discovery is a clue to his identity, and I thought that he would eventually piece everything together and slowly discover who he is.<br /><br />Then the book slows down. A lot.<br /><br />The action sequences in the beginning of the book are excellent, because they aren't just gratuitous scenes - they develop Jason's character. In sharp contrast, the action sequences in the middle of the book don't develop the characters... so they actually become a little boring.<br /><br />For me, the discovery of Jason's identity was the thrill; but he stops discovering things on his own after about a hundred pages.<br /><br />That's when Ludlum introduces all the other characters in the book. There are seriously about 32 extra characters in the book, and I have no idea who they are, because their only purpose is to give Jason a backstory. The problem with adding so many characters is that they have no consequence. There's no reason to know about them or care about them. Adding so many random characters creates confusion while taking away from Jason's development.<br /><br />Also, there's supposed to be a villian of some kind in this book, named Carlos. The problem there is that readers don't really develop a reason to hate him, and he never becomes a villian. For the entire book, Carlos doesn't actually do anything wrong... he just talks. Why would Jason Bourne want to kill some guy that hasn't done anything bad in the book? There's no real sense that Carlos is an evil man. In fact, it's hinted that everyone who knows Carlos actually loves him. That whole situation made me feel detached from Jason's purpose.<br /><br />Then, at the very end, instead of recovering his memories, Jason meets another random character who simply fills in his entire backstory - thus destroying the excitement of Jason discovering things on his own.<br /><br />I really would only recommend the first hundred pages of the book. Ludlum's style is very strong, and the first hundred pages are very engaging. After that, the coolness of Jason Bourne gets lost in the backstory that's told by a jungle of random characters.backstory - thus destroying the excitement of Jason discovering things on his own.<br /><br />I really would only recommend the first hundred pages of the book.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I think I'm going nuts to because of this game I love it so much it has became a great hobi
B005Q1W10A|3.0|This is an interesting series to watch, but I find myself becoming irritated with the soap opera-ish way that each episode lunges from one crisis to another. Cybil running off with the chauffeur is quite ridiculous. The classes would not have mixed to that extent. Mary's acting is awful. I think I could have played the part better than she did. She speaks in a monotone, whatever the situation that she is dealing with. She seemed to come alive when the Hugarian diplomat entered the series, and then died at the same time that he did. The way that the head of the house behaves out of character with a maid is ridiculous and not believable. Had his character been the type to do this, it would have been believable, but he acted completely out of character. All in all, watchable, but not of a classical standard for those that love Pride and Prejudice. I would actually prefer to see some of the English classics made into repeat films, than to continue to see modern revisions of how things use to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this id a great wonderful game me and my sister play all the time so I hope you love it to
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An excellent three book series. Although I read the books quickly, I was sad for the adventure to end. I hope the movie will be equally intertaining..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game (games) even though you have to unlock most of the games. Very challenging and fun games.
0545265355|1.0|Note: Series Spoilers<br /><br />So, I'm critiquing the series as a whole. There are major spoilers for the entire series, so don't read this if you don't want it ruined for you. You've been warned.<br /><br />I didn't like the books. And I've read the whole series twice. (This doesn't mean I liked it, I reread books I hate and reread books I love more times than I can count). The problem is the books frustrate the hell out of me. I think the idea is really interesting, and I'm actually kind of excited for the movie, but the writing is just so awful in so many ways that I can't help but hate the books.<br /><br />Firstly, Collins writes in first person, present tense. First person isn't a bad form of writing, and several of my favorite books are written in it. But by writing in first person the books can never be called \\"well-written.\\" It's just not a good stylistic choice. The books can still be good, but not well-written. However, writing in present tense is ALWAYS bad. I'd never encountered it before I read the Hunger Games, but I'm sad to say I've encountered it a lot sense. You just don't write in present tense. It's awful. For one thing, you can't write in present tense without at least occasionally switching tenses, as you have to write about past events sometimes. (Like Gale telling Katniss about when he first realized he loved her. Collins had to switch to past tense then). Switching tenses is an elementary mistake of writing. It was so off-putting that I had to read the first sentence of the first book about twenty times, and then the first page another twenty times. I couldn't believe it. It's just a really awkward, awful, juvenile way of writing. I would have thrown the book across the room if one of my friends hadn't kept going on about how amazing the series was. I decided to give it a chance, but I really think the book is crappily written solely because of the present tense thing.<br /><br />Secondly, Collins' writing was confusing. There were partsof the books where I just didn't understand what was going on. Mockingjay, especially, was hard to follow. It took me several pages to realize Prim had died. After I read Mockingjay the second time, things became clearer, but the ending was definitely rushed and it was like Collins didn't put any effort into writing it. I didn't get what was going on with Coin and the political stuff until my second read. It just wasn't written well.<br /><br />Thirdly, Collins tackled some major issues but did so very poorly. I love the idea of the Hunger Games, where the kids had to kill each other to survive. There are so many things a writer can do with that. Katniss stated many times that it was incredibly wrong for the kids to kill each other, that the Capital was sick for making them do it, and she and the districts were fighting against such brutality. But Collins didn't do anything but state that this was bad. Katniss didn't have any emotional reaction to her first or subsequent kills. She didn't comment on the emotional turmoil that comes from taking another human life, especially a child's. Collins could have spent pages describing Katniss's reaction to her first murder and how it made her feel awful that she'd taken a life. Katniss didn't describe how the death she caused would affect the boy's family or what he would have been able to contribute to the world and now can never do. The boy could have cured cancer, and now he wouldn't because Katniss killed him. Katniss didn't reflect on the impact of such a substantial action. However, if Collins' intention was that Katniss wasn't supposed to have an emotional reaction to her first murder, Collins should have commented on that as well. Why didn't Katniss reflect on her lack of emotion? Why didn't Katniss question why she didn't feel badly about murder? Why didn't Katniss ask herself \\"What does that make me? I killed a person and I feel nothing. Am I a bad person? What has the Capital done to me, so that I don't care thatI took another human life? Am I a sociopath? Do I care if I am? Collins could have spent pages on Katniss's self analysis, but she doesn't. One of the best things about first person is that you can get inside the characters' head, but Collins doesn't use this to her advantage. If nothing else, first person is perfect for this type of book because Katniss's reaction to the death around her can be fully experienced. But Collins doesn't deal with this. She states that the Katniss is against The Hunger Games because it is violent, brutal, and kills children. She feels badly when she visits the other tributes' districts and has to see their families. But why doesn't she reflect on her murders? Why doesn't Collins write about this?<br /><br />Collins also tried to comment of consumerism in society, but I felt it fell flat. I thought the costumes and appearances of the Capital people were stupid rather than a commentary. In later books this commentary was done better, for instance, in Mockingjay when Katniss found all of the hoarded food in Capital apartments. But in the first book it just seemed odd.<br /><br />Fourthly, Collins' past as a screenwriter was clearly evident in her writing style, and I didn't think it worked as a book.<br />She ended every book on a cliff-hanger as if it was a TV show and the next episode would debut the next week. But books aren't TV shows. There more like TV seasons. While a series may have an overarching plot or problem, each individual book needs to wrap up the main plot for that book. In Sorcerer's Stone, the plot was the Sorcerer's Stone. Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius Black's escape. Goblet of Fire, the Triwizard Tournament. But the overarching plot of the Harry Potter series was Voldemort's attempted ascension to power. Collins didn't wrap up her books. She clearly doesn't know how to write an ending. If she'd written ten more pages, she could have finished the first book. Instead, Katniss grabbed Peeta's hand and it was like the last few pages were missing. The second book was even more a disaster. It was like Collins thought \\"Oh, well, I've written about 300 hundred pages. That's how long a book should be. I guess I'll just conclude this sentence in the next one.\\" And Mockingjay proved she didn't know how to end a book. She wrote about five pages to sum everything up. It just didn't work.<br /><br />Lastly, Collins didn't know how to write the romantic element of the story. I've heard the love triangle was her editor's idea - and her editor pushed it - so I won't criticize Collins for her failure at that. However, she didn't write the romance well. For one, Collins introduced Gale before she introduced Peeta. Peeta is supposed to be \\"the one,\\" yet she immediately set up Gale to be the love interest. I think Katniss even said that she and Gale would probably end up married. (And this was before Peeta was introduced). Gale also pitched the \\"running away together\\" idea, and instead of refuting it on the grounds that she wasn't into Gale, Katniss just said they couldn't do it because of their families. Collins set up Gale to be Katniss's love interest before Peeta was introduced, and since Peeta was supposed to be the one, this was a failure on Collins's part. Furthermore, I never really believed that Katniss loved Peeta. There were moments when I did, like when Peeta was shocked by the electric fence in Catching Fire, but for the most part I felt Katniss didn't love him. But that wouldn't have mattered if Collins had developed their relationship at the end of Mockingjay. Instead, Katniss goes from someone absolutely numb over her sister's death to being in love with Peeta with some kids two pages later. Then end of book. Collins just didn't develop their relationship properly.<br /><br />Okay, I've written a lot, but I've been dying to get this out for ages. I just get so frustrated because the books could be so good, but Collins just ruined it. I'm looking forward to the movie because I think thisstory is truly meant to be a movie, and not a book, but I don't agree that everyone thinks the books are good. At least I don't.

0307352145|5.0|I work for a Fortune 500 company and experience daily the situations that Cain highlights in her book.  I spend my work day going from meeting to meeting with barely time to work in a bathroom break in between.  The meetings are supposed to encourage cross-functional collaboration, and, at times, this happens.  But too often the meeting is dominated by the most outspoken person at the table and those who are quick to respond.  People who are more contemplative and like to have their facts together before putting a stake in the ground are not heard from.  We end meetings and claim victory for having achienved alignment, while many around the table never even had a chance to speak. Decisions are being driven by the vocally dominant; not necessarily by the well-informed.<br /><br />The corporate model that drives 'group think' as the only option is ready for a change, and I hope that all of the research Cain has brought to the discussion will cause senior leaders to think.<br /><br />Thanks for getting the dialogue going, Ms. Cain.

0142419400|5.0|I really LOVED this book!  It's a beautiful love story, and very well written.  It honestly depicts the feelings of first love, the feelings of growing up and branching out into the world, the emotions of longing to be near a person, and the electric physical sensations you get when you come in contact with them...their hand brushing yours, etc.  It wasn't too long ago that I was Anna's age, and I still feel like I'm caught in this transition into the 'real, grown-up world,' so I really identified with her character in many ways.  Plus, the setting of a boarding school in Paris is a nice bit of escapism, because the author does a very good job describing the surroundings of the bustling city of lights.  I will want to read this book again and again!
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|I love PBS Masterpiece movies...and this is by far one of the best. The acting was superb and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. They should make more movies like this one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like it. It's challenging.  There is actually a reason to keep playing and go forward. I recomend it. you start off with do many games and ghr more you play the games, the more you want to get the points and unlock mord fun games. Each different teer costs more points to unlock the games, so there is never is dull moment.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|When I played this game, I noticed that the games don't have very good graphics, and the controls are limited and make it difficult to complete the game. The games are challenging and simple at the same time, so it makes you want to come back for more.
B0078N2MTE|1.0|We do NOT recommend this movie.  VERY slow moving.  You become convinced the guy is nuts.  Takes way too long to get to the point of the story and then it's disappointing when it ends.  Not much character development of any of the characters.  Kathy Baker had a VERY small part, which in itself was a disappointment.  She's a great actress who was not given enough screen time to appreciate.  Do NOT waste your time on this one.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Very much worth it. I am a soldier in the united states army and this is perfect for those of us who are constantly on the move. I paired mine with a set of turtle beach headphones and I don't bother a soul in my barracks. And the unit is also compact it fits in my wall locker nicely and protects my Xbox as well.
1612130283|5.0|I loved it loved it loved it it kept me on pins and needles the whole way through the book.<br /><br />Hugs
1612130283|3.0|That's the story...simply OK... even in the disturbing category...Steven King and Robert McCammom disturb me more! Sophomoric applies. Don't waste your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very addictive I seen some reviews said it don't work with the kindle fire it works great on mine, the games get harder as you unlock more games which I like
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Brilliant!<br /><br />This is Sinéad O'Connor's best album in many years. I think it's fair to say that she masters all genres between standards and reggae and all temperaments between vulnerability and anger/ aggression. Here she is back in more rock-like style doing what she really does best, since she's not only a great singer but also an excellent, creative and tabooless songwriter: Singing her own songs (except for one cover version).<br /><br />The material varies over a wide spectrum of issues and emotions such as impersonating the lonely and desperate junkie and criminal in the haunting \\"Reason With Me\\" (which has some of the same qualities and the universal resonance as her version of \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\" from her hitalbum \\"I do not want what I haven't got\\") to having a crush on a married man in the teasing \\"Old Lady\\" to addressing the hypocrisy and ignorance of colleagues in \\"V.I.P.\\" to loss/ seperation in \\"Back Where You Belong\\" -the latter an issue those who are familiar with her previous work will know she can handle and express extremely well and direct. (-Think of \\"Troy,\\" Nothing Compares 2 U,\\" I am stretched on your grave,\\" and \\"Paddy's Lament.\\")<br /><br />But this album also contains less \\"heavy\\" -but yet lovely and perhaps surprising- tracks such as the pop-rocky \\"Wolf is Getting Married\\" and the vivid \\"4th & Vine.\\"
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I've tried everything and cant get through.  I really want to play it looks great.  the reviews said it is a really great game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game just wish you got more levels right when you played the only reason I'm writing this is because you get 250000 dollars on the game you will love this game it is so fun you need to get it
1416955070|5.0|This book is fantastic.  It has such an original story line and does an excellent job in keeping the reader interested.  I'm an adult who loves to read books in this genre, and this is one of my favorites.  Well worth the read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is a relaxing way to play Majongg. The graphics are nice and I like that the tileboard zooms in as tiles are cleared.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Its not to bad it give u something to do when there nothing does! The idea was a good one but get up to date games!
B000ZELISO|1.0|There are two ways your Blu-Ray player can connect to your television with high definition video: HDMI (the new single connector) and component (a set of Red, Green, and Blue plugs). Some foolish adopters of HD displays bought before HDMI existed, so we have to use the old-school component wires.  Just to taunt you, all of the previews on the disc will run in high definition, showing you what you won't see when the movie starts.<br /><br />Because, you see, the movie might be stolen if they let you watch it through component, so a message pops up, explaining that video resolution is reduced when viewing through unprotected connections, and the rest of the viewing experience is no better than DVD. Possibly worse than DVD.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being unfair to the fine work done by the actors and crew on a fun movie, but the accountants and lawyers got in the way and ruined my viewing experience, so I thought I might warn others. Unless you have HDMI, don't buy this movie in Blu-Ray.
0374275637|1.0|An unrelentingly tedious book that can be summed up as follows. We are irrationally prone to jump to conclusions based on rule-of-thumb shortcuts to actual reasoning, and in reliance on bad evidence, even though we have the capacity to think our way to better conclusions. But we're lazy, so we don't. We don't understand statistics, and if we did, we'd be more cautious in our judgments, and less prone to think highly of our own skill at judging probabilities and outcomes. Life not only is uncertain, we cannot  understand it systemically, and luck has just as much to do with what happens to us -- maybe even more -- than we care to admit. When in doubt, rely on an algorithm, because it's more accurate than your best guess or some expert's opinion. Above all, determine the freaking baseline before you come to any decisions.<br /><br />If you like endless -- and I mean endless -- algebraic word problems and circuitous anecdotes about everything from the author's dead friend Amos to his stint with the Israeli Air Defense Force, if you like slow-paced, rambling explanations that rarely summarize a conclusion, if your idea of a hot date is to talk Bayesian theory with a clinical psychologist or an economist, then this book is for you, who are likely a highly specialized academically-inclined person. Perhaps you are even a blast at parties, I don't know.<br /><br />But if you're like me and you prefer authors to cut to the chase, make their point, and then leave you with a whopping big appendix if you're interested in the regression analysis of how many freshmen would watch a guy choke to death because they think someone else will come to the rescue, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />If you want to take the Reader's Digest pass through the book, then Chapter 1 and Section 3 are probably the most accessible and can be read in less than an hour, and still leave you with a fair understanding of the author's thesis.
0385344228|4.0|Provocative is probably the best word that comes to mind when thinking of this book. While the plot is interesting and deals with a murder where the assistant DA's son is suspected of murder, just as interesting is the question of the existence of a violence gene. The characters are well developed and the plot moves along at a pace that will certainly prevent that mid book slowdown that sometimes occurs. The end is quite surprising (at least it was to me). I can understand some recurring comments on this book that Landay is the next Grisham. This is an interesting and gripping read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|cool game, play every chance I get. great graphics. like the hint bar on the bottom and the undo button.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I like putting in an ab workout now and then (certainly not daily). I like this because you don't have to look at a screen or a TV or anything. All you have to do is listen for the cues on when to switch ab exercises. If you are looking to get some better abs, give this app a shot!
B00000K3D4|5.0|I bought the anniversary edition on dvd a year or so ago. It's definitely one of my favorite movies. I have always loved jim henson with the muppets, etc. The Labyrinth is awesome in it's own way, henson used a lot of complex technology for that time. I remember hearing on a biography that it didn't do as well as he hoped, but I have always loved labyrinth. I'm glad that I grew up with his work, although he died when I was still young, but I don't think anyone will ever forget him and what he did.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|This reminds me of playing Dominoes as a kid. The graphics are pretty basic, but there aren't a lot of Domino games available. So if you absolutely love the game of Dominoes, go ahead and pick this one up. As for me, I ran it for a while but it wasn't my cup of tea. I did run just fine on my EVO 3D.
B0055SWM08|1.0|I really tried to like this annoying game.  Sorry, but I do not see the attraction.  I coulda bought a cup of coffee instead.  Eeeeeuuuuuccccchhhhh!
B004HW7JI8|4.0|Although the outfits that the characters wear are not what you would see in most high schools, teenagers and adults should be able to relate to some of the storyline (honesty, relationships, parent-child relationships, friendship, etc). The overall plot is what really makes the show special. It is engrossing and keeps the viewer wanting more. Recommended!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok, I guess. I can do without the ads but its ok, hey u get what u pay for.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Love this game (previously 5 stars) but when my Xoom updated to Ice Cream Sandwich it only freezes and causes delays.  I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling but still the same problems.  Beware...if your running 4.0 don't buy this game.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|it force closes when you try to watch the radar. Please update the app so it runs smooth and properly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is so much fun to play. me and my friends play the all night and we can never beet it. this game give it ten thumbs up
B0078YWDHO|1.0|This is one of the most boring, dragged out, non-entertaining movies I have seen in a while and I adore Johnny Depp. If you can watch it for free on Netflix and you have nothing better to do, watch it. Otherwise, don't waste your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I probably play this game daily and enjoy all of the options. Great variety of mini games and all are lots of fun! Definitely something for everyone in this app!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|collecting all these nuts will take some time but it will add up before you know it.  the costumes are fun and add some change to the look
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I'm addicted to these games there so much fun if u play add me my id is pinkfarmqueen its tottaly worth getting
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was soo so so so so so so so fun! ! X X X X X X X X X X Z Z Z Z.Z.Z.ZD GOOD GAME!!!! KAMEON LOVES.YOU AWESOME COOL AMAZING FUN COOL
B006ON41FC|5.0|We have had fun with this app, how much more can you realistically ask?! I've had no issues and hours of quiet. Mission accomplished.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had no problems with this app at all on my Fire.  It has maintained the correct location and has given the right info and alerted daily.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this is a super fun way to play a classic game..keeps you intrigued to play through the whole storyline. I liked it a lot :)
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Once you download the app to your phone you can not uninstall it. Real pain in the butt. I WANT to uninstall it and haven't been able to and after checking on line it seems to be a problem everyone has and there is no solution.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Having become an instant fan of the Firefly series and to find out that, indeed, a movie had been made, I rented it.  That meant I wanted a copy myself. Excellent in bringing up to speed from the series, I think it was ahead of it's time in a fashion and an astonishing history. The DVD came exactly as offered, no surprises, ordered, shipped, and received in excellent time (and condition). Rated all aspects excellent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good way to pass the time. Calms the brain after a long day at work. The pop up ads are annoying.
B002V9PEU4|4.0|We all have things in life that we shouldn't love but we do, Last Action Hero is a perfect example of this. I personally love this silly, cheesy flick just because it is so silly and cheesy. Is it high art? No. Does it belong to be mentioned in the same breath as Citizen Kane and The Godfather? Dear god no. Is it a fun distractions from a sometimes far to serious world? Yeah it is and if you're like me, sometimes that's what you need.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|If you think that children murdering children is entertaining... then I guess this is the movie for you. The writing itself isn't that impressive and the plot is sickening. As if society isn't growing insensitive enough to death and violence with the horrible movies and video games out today. Basically, if you are a parent with any morals, you will not encourage or allow your child to read the book or watch the movie. It is absolutely disgusting!
031603441X|5.0|I purchased this book along with others and everything was as described. Very good condition and the book its self was excellent. I am happy is all i have to say. Thank you
B0019AGD6A|5.0|From the first book to the latest I look forward to the sweet, gentle life of Precious Romatwe and her extended family.  I enjoyed these books so much I ended up hooked on the other Alexander McCall Smith series; Isabel Dalhousie and 44 Scotland Street.
B005721W9O|4.0|Great Sci-fi spoof taking off the Star Trek series. It is produced well and is entertaining for ages 8 and greater.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game.  I have beat it already and then deleated and reloaded it again and 2nd time around is just as good.  Trying to get every level perfect. Not easy, keeps me thinking.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a really great app. u get access 2 lots of versions, and many can be downloaded so u don't need an Internet connection to access them. thanks for giving us free access!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was skeptical when this book was recommended to me because it was labeled teen.  Once I began to read it drew me in.  Writing is excellent and I am now on 3rd book!
0439023513|4.0|If you read this book and have been in or personally affected by war, the book will resonate with you.  This book shows how war changes the main characters and brought back memories how my fiance was so drastically changed after his many tours in the \\"desert.\\"  You will not see the same Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, or Gale you came to like in the previous books.  They have been changed by the war and seem at times to be shells of who they really once were.  I will not spoil who dies and who lives, but remember while you read this book if you are a soldier in the field fighting you have no time to mourn the dead at that time, and when you leave the field you want to bury the memories and pretend it never existed and probably will not mourn them then either.  I wish the Epilogue was a little better, I did find it a bit anti-climatic and left me wanting more; but really after dealing with war and finding a way to move on life is anti-climatic and leaves you wanting more.  When I finished I did immediately call and tell one of my friends she needs to read the series if she has not already.  From the writing stand point I feel Susan Collins is a good writer and wasn't annoyed with the books because she kept reminding the reader of stupid things every page or two like I was with the Twilight series.  Nor did want to kill off / kill Katniss by the time I was in the middle of this book like I did with Bella in the middle of Breaking Dawn.  I would probably read the series again.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|In Running Lean Ash has created a step-by-step action plan for product development that allows entrepreneurs to take the guesswork out of new businesses and new products. Highly recommended!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this little note pad, keeping little notes, quotes, and ideas. love that I can pull it up on my kindle and have it synced to my computer.
B006ON41FC|5.0|My girls love this game. They can't put it down. The first time they played it on the Kindle Fire they were amazed!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I've never had a problem with Adobe's products untill I tryed it with my new kindle'fire.  I keep getting a \\"upgrade flash player\\" error over and over.  Any suggestions?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is awesome! The game gets harder and difficult. It keeps me eager to want to do it again and again!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|My Ps3 slim was turning off after 20-30 minutes of use.<br />Bought some arctic silver, stripped down the PS3, cleaned everything off and dobbed a tab in the middle of both chips.<br />Put it all back together and 6 hours later, PS3 still humming cool and nice.<br /><br />Ive used \\"other\\" thermal solutions before and they just do not last like Arctic does. You also use alot less of it typically.<br /><br />NOTE: why are there always a couple of screws left over when you put something back together ?
B0017WCERM|1.0|I purchased the Vinyl edition of this album about a month ago.  I was excited to listen to \\"Orion\\" only to be disappointed by constant hisses and pops from a BRAND NEW Vinyl.  One track wouldn't even play all the way through it would reach a certain point and skip over and over again.<br /><br />I thought I might have gotten a bad disk so I returned it.  The second disk had exactly the same problems. I've bought 20 year old vinyls that sounded better.<br /><br />I think this is just a really cheap pressing.  I've noticed that the best vinyls tend to advertise they have a high grain (180).  This vinyl seems really thin and cheap.  Maybe that is why it is so messed up.<br /><br />I'm giving the vinyl edition 1 star.  Its a 5 star album though.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I gave up on Stephen King several years ago.  While The Stand will always remain one of my favorite books, I found some of the middle novels like Cujo wrecking havoc  with my suspension of disbelief!  On the contrary, 11/22/63 was accomplished with verisimilitude intact. What is most charming about King's novels is his careful construction of characters.  The reader becomes a part of the building.  And the fact that everything shifts each time our hero walks back down those stairs to that other time builds new suspence and anticipation.  From my point of view, this is his best since The Stand and I will be forced to take a look at his new one!
B0070Z9KWM|4.0|If you've seen one haunted house movie, then you've already seen this movie.  The cast is excellent. Daniel Craig and Rachel Wiesz are beautiful to watch, but after the first ten minutes of this movie, you know what's going on and pretty much how it will end.  The movie isn't bad, it's just predictable.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|now, i gave it a 4 star rating.  it's not to say that I'm giving it a 4 compared to \\"The Godfather\\" or something but a star rating for its class of movie.  it's a comic book movie and I'm a comic book fan.  i found it to be thoroughly fun and entertaining for what it was.  totally worth the rental, anyways.  i enjoyed this enough that i am looking forward to The Avengers this summer more than i was before.
1469984202|5.0|I am so excited to have found this author.  Hugh Howey has that magical combination I am always seeking: both an excellent writer AND story-creator. The story is smart, original, and compelling (made me anxious as hell). The writing is solid, flows perfectly and with great style.<br /><br />I almost never write reviews. I can't recommend these books enough. Mainly, I can't wait to read more by Howey!
B0063GORYU|5.0|the game runs smoothly. ads arent annoying. works great on my htc evo shift. you can change the background which is cool.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This Verso Artist Series case cover is absolutely perfect for my Kindle Fire. It combines a classy look with functionality. The four elastic corners hold the Kindle Fire securely while allowing access to the on/off button and recharging port on the bottom. The cover is textured so it is easy to grasp. I love the way the cover folds back so that I can hold it in one hand as if I were holding a book.  I tried several different covers before deciding to buy this one. I couldn't be happier. Five stars for a great product!
B0055MBQOM|1.0|I followed directions very very carefully on 3 separate computers (2 macs and 1 windows). I used the quick and the advanced settings to see if there is a difference. I went to their website and used the updated software.<br /><br />Every computer and monitor (including a classroom projector) I used it on turned all the greys and blacks into browns. And if I try to watch a movie with dark scenes, everything was dark brown and I couldn't tell anything. I can't imagine it being accurate at all.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|This was a great read as I am an avid tennis lover and follow this man and his achievements.What an insight into his life and his character and values............ I would highly recommend this read.
B003L77G06|5.0|Great experience! I received the DVD right on time and it is great quality! I would recommend this buyer to a friend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!! its great fun. I do wish some of the games were more challenging but other than that really fun. I would be willing to pay for it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the better spider solitare due to one can change how many suits you want to play to challenge your skills.

B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a very fun game.  It is very well made in my opinion, I play it all the time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun app - i like that there is so much variety and that you can unlock more games as you go. Perfect to play on a plane when you're bored :)
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|For what is in the box, it should have been about 50 bucks or so. There are NO surround sound mixes or any kind of upgraded audio, so I feel a bit cheated for the amount of money spent. The music that is included is good, but not worth the asking price. Skip it, buy the other Immersion sets instead which do have surround sound mixes, etc.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not enough into about games.<br />some of the games are difficult to play, like the soccer game. I haven't. be able to get the ball to stay il no matter where I touch the ball
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love love love this game. an insomniac's best friend and so very addicting. cant put it down. add me, I tip and gift everyday! username: rachelmeyer
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I found this very useful.  His approach was so simple, yet who could argue with his results!<br />This is a very clever strategy that anyone can implement and have success with.<br />I plan to use it myself.<br />Thanks for sharing John, and wishing you continued success!
1469984202|4.0|I'm not even done with the omnibus edition (thank you Amazon Prime for free download), but I had to add my review.  The Wool series is a must for sci fi fans. The author draws such wonderful pictures of life in the silo from up top to the down deep you can feel yourself looking at it from the characters eyes...and shuddering at having to live like that. Society at its most compact and unimaginable.<br /><br />Additional comments: finished and bought the Omnibus Wool so I can reread anytime I want. Can't wait for more in the series to see the new direction Silo 18 takes (and what happens with 17).
B000SEGHT6|2.0|I was disappointed with the book.  I was expecting a description of the fire-bombing of Dresden, but there was very little, if anything, of the fire-bombing itself.<br /><br />I purchased the book from Amazon with my Kindle.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I wish I had read the first book more recently than a few months ago.. Because this book picks up right where the last one left off.<br />It's a great story. Jumps around alot but isn't hard to follow.<br />After I finished it, I was DYING to read the next one!!!!!! I can't believe what happened at the end.<br /><br /> A must read!!
B0071QIN00|3.0|just like TX2, NEEDS bigger buttons on tablet!! and please drop openfeint. its suspicious and annoying. fix these problems and I give 5 stars, cause it is a great game.
B004UO4AYE|1.0|If you think that this book helps you to improve your german, don't get wrong. It's a xenophobic and irrational propaganda for a deemed \\"high and noble\\" Aryan german; a repugnat text. Amazon shouldn't allow the up and download of this kind of rubbish.
B0073Q0DZG|1.0|This takes one of the funniest humans ever born, Steve and completely neuters him.  That alone is a remarkable achievemet in filmmaking. The usually manic Jack Black is somnambulant and Owen Wilson's trademark smarm is kept on a nauseating \\"keep warm\\" setting. The result is a bland, endless, harmless comedy-in-name-only.  The filmmakers also take a Smurf/Smurfette view of the world: birds are almost exclusively male, with one exception, and, you guessed it, she is there to mate with a male lead. Oh, and there's Anjelica Huston piloting a boat. I would pay good money to have this erased from my brain.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i ab&szlig;olutely love this game i had on my ipod and still loved it totally worth the money. get it!

B006DQ1J0K|5.0|The more of these live broadcasts released from the Met archives we hear, the more we become aware of a standard of cast and performance that might then have been taken for granted but which seems impossibly exalted today. The only pity is that they were not recorded in stereo; as it is, we must be content with clean, slightly boxy mono sound occasionally punctuated with some wow and fade such as we hear at the end of the great ensemble \\"Oh sommo Carlo\\" which concludes Act III. Supposedly re-mastered for this first Met-authorised release, the sound is apparently little different from or better than previous unauthorised releases but no-one will complain at the price. We are not exactly short of good recordings of \\"Ernani\\"; there is the excellent, stereo 1967 RCA studio recording with the same two principal singers and conductor, a classic vintage performance from RAI in 1950 with Caterina Mancini, Gino Penno and Giuseppe Taddei conducted by Previtali and the celebrated live blockbuster from Florence in 1957 starring Del Monaco, Cerquetti, Christoff and Bastianini - beat that for a cast!<br /><br />Having said that, I think there are still very good reasons for buying this set, not least the opportunity to hear Leontyne Price in such youthful, vibrant voice that she sounds positively reckless in her attack on her music; she is as thrilling as Mancini and Cerquetti but with even more beauty of tone. True, one or two top notes squawk a little, but by and large this is the most vital and uninhibited singing you will ever hear from her. Bergonzi, too, while he will never have the heft and squillo of Del Monaco, is as elegant as ever and immensely touching in his lament \\"Solingo, errante e misero\\", but also extraordinarily released, capping the cavatina to his opening aria with a prolonged B flat that raises the roof. To complete a trio of superb singers, Cornell MacNeill is in massively authoritative voice, firm and expressive if occasionally slightly vibrato-heavy; he twice caps his big moments with ringing A-flats. The singers' grandstanding results in spontaneous audience applause over the music but that just adds to the drama of what was clearly a great occasion. The supporting cast, led by a black-voiced Giorgio Tozzi as the implacable Silva, is very good, especially Robert Nagy in the small tenor role of Riccardo.<br /><br />Schippers conducts a brisk, urgent, flexible performance which has a small cut in the chorus for the \\"Festa di Ballo\\" opening Act IV but is otherwise complete. This is not a subtle opera: there are lots of \\"oompah-pah\\" ¾ passages and the melodramatic plot, with its insistence upon honour over common sense or morality, is rebarbative to a modern audience; Hugo condemned the adaptation of his play \\"Hernani\\" as \\"travesty\\". On the other hand, the succession of great, rollicking tunes and strong characterisation whereby a persona is closely linked to its voice type, make this, Verdi's fifth opera, first performed in 1844 and his first real success since \\"Nabucco\\", a tempting bargain. The music is by no means all rum-ti-tum; there is a lovely orchestral introduction to Elvira's first appearance on stage which is reminiscent of the one used Bellini used to introduce Adalgisa in \\"Norma\\" and the set pieces, such as the aforementioned ensemble and the great trio which concludes the work, are both  stirring and sophisticated.<br /><br />This issue of yet another of the Met Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts is self-recommending as long as you are tolerant of mono sound.wice caps his big moments with ringing A-flats. The singers' grandstanding results in spontaneous audience applause over the music but that just adds to the drama of what was clearly a great occasion. The supporting cast, led by a black-voiced Giorgio Tozzi as the implacable Silva, is very good, especially Robert Nagy in the small tenor role of Riccardo.<br /><br />Schippers conducts a brisk, urgent, flexible performance which has a small cut in the chorus for the \\"Festa di Ballo\\" opening Act IV but is otherwise complete. This is not a subtle opera: there are lots of \\"oompah-pah\\" ¾ passages and the melodramatic plot, with its insistence upon honour over common sense or morality, is rebarbative to a modern audience; Hugo condemned the adaptation of his play \\"Hernani\\" as \\"travesty\\".

B006YXTRHY|2.0|Easily the worst movie I've seen since the last Twilight.  A total waste of 2 hours.  It ought to be legal to throw bombs on the set of the next one!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|As much fun as reading a book with a well written plot.  I couldn't put it down.  Challenges your deductive skills while exploring a beautiful world.<br />Highly recommend it.

B003DZX3SA|4.0|I recently took my daughter to see Beauty and the Beast in 3-D.  She loved it so much that I had to get her the DVD for the house.  I bought it used online, it came in great condition and arrived quickly.  I was very pleased.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so well written and intriguing I couldn't put it down! After a few hours I was done and hungry for more!!
B0042L78MG|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim and every time I play it someone asks me \\"who is this!?\\".  The sound is fresh and inviting and offers something different than your average commercial product.  As a dancer I look for playful music that can crossover between dance styles and CARO achieves that in her work.  I absolutely recommend this CD!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|good all I love playing on this app after school everyday. this app is very very adicting. I think you should download this app right now
B002W7J3SO|1.0|Hitch's movie is great but the streaming was wretched.<br />I gave up on watching it and won't use Amazon's stream again after a 2nd movie worked the same way. I miss my old netflix.<br />Too bad regular TV with so much promise when it came out has ended in reality shows and other stupid games. All that's left is Public tv with their countless cooking shows and antique road shows. I miss the hosts and old movies where I watched this movie first with my Mom.<br />Sadly when I tried to do the same with my daughter the movie kept stopping and freezing so we gave up.<br />Amazon- fix your streaming. The classics deserve better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|relaxing...love it! everyone should have it!  most used app I have down loaded.  very thought provoking. would recommend to any one
B0061S073A|3.0|Good for the kindle fire, but two problems.  The kindle app doesn't work within kids place on the kindle fire, so the only way kids can access their books is by giving them access to the launcher.  This lets them see all the content on the device (although they can only open apps you've selected).  Ideally it would be best if you could choose to give them the kindle app instead of the launcher. Second, I set it for airplane mode so it would automatically disable the wireless connection when the app is opened, it worked the first time but has stopped working and doesn't disable the connection even though the setting is turned on.  I manually turn off the wireless and open the app before giving it to the kids, but ideally if you choose this setting it would do what its supposed to do.  5 star app if those 2 issues were fixed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is so addicting and just like the original! I can't t stop playing it over and over! Astounding game!!! I highly recommend it.

B005DKLPF6|4.0|Mastodon is my favorite band by far and I would rate all of their previous albums a five, so I was scared reading the pre release press on this more straight forward \\"rock\\" album with a new producer and shorter songs. I was right to be scared. Oh believe me I have tried to like The Hunter more - I've listened to it over and over again, and yes, it is \\"good\\", but not great. I could never imagine giving anything Mastodon records less than 4 stars, as they are super awesome. This simply does not measure up with the other albums. Sure, \\"Curl of the Burl\\" is strangely catchy and will burrow itself into your brain, but this is just not an album that will be seeing a lot of airplay in years to come. Why? It just sounds weird! It sorta sounds like Mastodon for a while, and then comes a really radio friendly chorus that is just wrong. Plus, as others have pointed out, the production does not suit this type of music. The vocals and drums are way up front, and during the verses the guitars are dialed wayyy back. Seriously, listen back to any track and listen for the guitars during the verse- it's hard to hear them!! There is still the fantastic drumming of Brann Dailor and some great soloing, so I do find enjoyment in this album. I'm just saying if I have all the Mastodon albums lined up and have to pick one to listen to, this would be the last one chosen. I understand they wanted to get away from the \\"seriousness\\" of Crack the Skye (one of the best albums ever) and get back to the more butt kicking groove of their earlier stuff, I just wish they had used Matt Bayles as the producer - the album would have had more balls and louder guitars. I'm sorry Mastodon - I'm not trying to insult you guys. I still love you (my dog sleeps with my Mastodon hat at night) and I'm really looking forward to what's next!
B0054JELS4|2.0|Season five  of this set is missing 4 episodes. Dvds are labeled correctly but they don't have the shows that are listed on them. Season one didn't have disc 5 correct. It was the same as disc 4 but with a disc 5 label. Not finished with the series yet. Hope I don't find anymore mistakes.
1612130283|2.0|I'm half-way through this mediocre piece of romance porn. The writing is atrocious - the author uses \\"inner goddess\\" on virtually<br />every other page.  Yes, the erotica is probably appealing to those who read \\"Twilight\\" (I haven't ). My friends talked about this book.  The media is all over it. Pun intended. So I'm ploughing through. (again..) Please read The Snow Child, beautifully lyrical, brought tears to my eyes.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|I was a rather disappointed with this film. I expected more of someone like Soderbergh. It is not enough to gather dozens of excellent actors to make a good movie. It is not because I am a virologist that I have this mild reaction but the film lack a solid story and the details about the scientific search of the nature of the virus and a protecting vaccine is superficial. Further development on the origin of the immunity of one of the protagonists is also lacking for the comprehension of a general public.
1905236042|4.0|This was a gift for a friends child.  I don't know much about them, but they seem to like them. I just needed the item delivered promply and that is was I got!

0446614459|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well written and kept me turning the pages. When I wasn't able to pick the book up I found myself thinking about the story and anxious to get back to it, in other words it pulled me in!! I also found Maxwell and King extremely likable and convincing. I have since read Hour Game (also starring Maxwell and King) and would highly recommend it to others who enjoyed this book.
1409115380|2.0|I thought the book was an easy read which kept my interest. However, I could not help but feel as though I was reading a take off on Thomas H Cook's Red Leaves.  The family dynamics, the suspicions, the family guilt and the famiky history were all explored in Red Leaves, and in my opinion, with greater suspense.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game to play gives you many options so you can change games easily. I would recommend this game.
B005NGKMOU|4.0|It was a very nice surprise to discover this \\"Bolivian\\" western made by a Spanish director. Sam Shepard, Stephen Rea and Eduardo Noriega are very good, the action never decreases and the Andes landscapes are superb.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Roger: \\"I put no stock in religion. By the word religion I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the will of god. I have seen too much religion in the eyes of too many murderers. Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness.\\"<br /><br />Tiberias: \\"But Saladin and the king between them would make a better world.\\"<br />Roger: \\"If it lives only for a while, Tiberias, it still has lived.\\"<br /><br />King Baldwin IV: \\"None of us know our end, really, or what hand will guide us there. A king may move a man, a father may claim a son, but that man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game. Remember that howsoever you are played or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone, even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power. When you stand before God, you cannot say, \\"But I was told by others to do thus,\\" or that virtue was not convenient at the time. This will not suffice. Remember that.\\"<br /><br />Best movie ever!!!

B004LWZW42|3.0|\\"Meh\\" really sums up this movie for me.  It was alright, but my life wouldn't have been incomplete without it.  I am not even sure if I will ever rewatch it.  I'm glad we got it out of a bin on Black Friday.<br /><br />It wasn't really that it was bad, it just didn't have any special grab for me for some reason.  I can't even really pinpoint why I didn't like it.  None of the characters particularly grabbed me, which I assume is because of the acting - none of them stood out to me.  The underlying story was interesting, particularly Magneto's evolution.  It just didn't feel well executed, somehow.  I also think it was a bit crowded; there were simply too many characters for them to show too much depth on any of them; even Magneto and the Professor were only superficially covered.  Granted, I think the point was a superficial introduction to each character, but it left me feeling no attachment to any of them or to the story itself.  I liked the Wolverine movie more somehow.  I am hoping the other Xmen movies are better.  I can't even think of much to say about it, so it can't have made much of an impression.<br /><br />I'd say watch it if you're interested in the Xmen story or if you like to always get the complete story, but as a stand alone movie it isn't worth much.

B000JQUGVI|1.0|I read a lot of the reviews & can't help wondering, were we all reading the same book? There were a few I agreed with, in that I found this book so boring & the narration was so long & full of nothing that it was like someone just rambling on & on. I normally spent a good 4 to 6 hours a day reading on my Kindle. But this story did not motivate me to pick up my Kindle much so I read it about 1 hour each day, until I couldn't take it anymore. I was forcing myself to read this book, when normally I have to force myself to put the Kindle down. That is when I have found a good story that has grabbed me in the first few pages. This book was like forcing myself to swallow a huge bitter pill. Maybe I missed something, so hey, take the advice of the 5 star reviewers & read it for yourself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you so much for creating this APP. Easy to download. Super easy to navigate the program on my iPod.
0307949486|5.0|This was a fantastic book!  While it starts off a little slow, it has become one of my favorite books.  The details are intricate and very fascinating.  Stieg Larsson obviously had a very vivid imagination.  I can't wait to read the next two.  The mystery takes several twists and turns and goes places you aren't expecting.  One of the most riveting books I've read in a long time!
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|The film was first class, like watching the original at the theater. A lot better than the VHS copy I have of the movie.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Guy, a hockey fanatic, uses finesse to sail his Enchantment puck into the net.<br /><br />I've followed Guy's career and writings over the years.  While his Apple enthusiasm has never resulted in me buying Apple products (I've never been able to justify their higher prices), I do admire him.<br /><br />As I read this book, I found that I have actually practiced many of his suggestions. In fact, when I was forced to retire in 2010 at age 71, the many hugs, thank you's and, yes, tears, I received from the in-plant customers of my web applications happened because they were enchanted with my efforts.  Enchantment works.

B004EBT5CU|1.0|I love female vocalists..... my favorites include Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, that girl from Garbage, Jessica Simpson, and last but not least the ever so popular Paris Hilton!  But I was amazed that someone could actually OUTDO all those artists combined...and she is Adele from Australia.  Ever since I heard \\"Someone like you\\" 5 million times this past week i INSTANTLY knew she was legendary.<br /><br />What more could you ask for? Adele's music has it all!<br />- Generic piano loops<br />- Depressing Lyrics about ex boyfriends<br />- Annoying vocals<br />- Music videos of her walking and singing<br /><br />Genius. That's the only word you can use to describe this amazing Australian singer.<br /><br />I did have to take away 4 stars because Adele didn't have any songs about eating a BigMac at McDonalds; she also doesn't have any sex tapes out yet.

B002XTXG1G|4.0|Bronson is a very entertaining look at the life of Britain's most violent prisoner. Tom Hardy is absolutely brilliant as the insane and hilarious brute, Charlie Bronson, and you'll find yourself rooting for him in the end, and sad for him when he is rejected. I don't know how true to life the film's events are, but it's good viewing nevertheless. Hardy completely transformed his body for the role, and looks amazing (and a lot more intimidating than you would expect for someone of his height). The director's use of monologues direct to the camera/theatre is powerful and captivating, and offer a look into a sociopathic mind. Watch it.<br /><br />p.s for those viewers as obbsessed with Tom Hardy as I am - prepare for full frontal nudity ;)

030746363X|1.0|I'd been on the Perfect 10 Diet for more than a year). Lost about 35 pounds and was stalling (which I'm beginning to think happens on diets). So I wanted to try something different and a friend of mine had lost 15 pounds on this diet so I switched over New Years Day.<br /><br />It was a terrible experience. I went from eating ultra-healthy organic foods to the \\"slow-carb diet\\". I lost 6 pounds in 2 months, almost all of it the first month. But there was a really bad consequence. I had been exercising cardio every day. And I had a lot more bounce and energy on Perfect 10.<br /><br />The 2nd month on 4-Hour I started to get \\"slow\\", lethargic. I still did my workout but I just didn't have the bounce that really excited me. I hadn't realized how much this food depressed me. He has you eat the same meals over and over. I had gotten rid of my sugar addiction on Perfect 10, it came back full force with \\"cheat days.\\" And the food is really not nutritious (but I'm not a nutritionist). I just don't think this diet is good for you. Or at least I didn't experience it as healthy. I felt weaker. I dropped this diet yesterday.
0741470314|5.0|What a pleasant suprise.  Although not a strong Michael Jackson fan when I started this book - it completely changed my outlook on him.  The book is thoughtful and well written.  It is easy to reay and provides detailed insight into the enigma we thought him to be.  For his fans, this book confirms all that you believed good in Michael Jackson.  For others, the book reveals MJ to be a great father and a thoughtful and caring person.  All of this in addition to his being a great and talented entertainer.  It may take a little more time, but one day the world will come to fully appreciate Michael for his values and his achievements.  Lonnie Johnson - A new admirer.

B004SIP6N6|5.0|This is in my top 10 favorite comedies of all time. The first time I saw it I laughed so hard it left me in tears. The sequel sucks to this film if you havent seen either 1 or 2 save ur time and definitely get the original. You won't b sorry I promise.
B0064MT1LM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. I am glad I purchased it.I enjoyed the cast, and the story. Well directed.
B00687XO1G|5.0|They must have said the word \\"panties\\" about 75 times during the course of the phenomenal film- not to mention spermatogenesis! No wonder it was banned in Chicago and a few other places back in 1959. But any film that combines Floyd the barber with Duke Ellington can't be all that bad. In fact, this is probably the greatest court room film ever made. Ellington's score alone is worth the price of admission (mono or 5.1 on the blu-ray); and Otto Preminger directing James Stewart, with George C Scott thrown in the mix makes this a perfect film. The black and white is just almost flawless with nary a blemish along the way. Definitely a must-see. Any objections to this film are overruled....
B004YOEFG8|4.0|The IMAX Hubble 3D is a video that I will watch several times. Picture quality is excellent, 3D affect is excellent, and the content is excellent, a history of this most amazing telescope with some of its spectacular observations thrown in. It also contains a brief primer about the universe.<br />I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because nothing is perfect but if you are in awe of the place in space we occupy, I think you will find this video stunning and wish it were longer with more of the telescopes \\"pictures\\" and their possible meaning.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sooooooo much fun. it has many games so you only have to download one app with many games instead of downloading many apps for a few variability of games.

B003M98792|5.0|Superbly fantastical spaghetti samurai-type film culled from the Lone Wolf and Cub series- dubbed in english with a cringe-inducing, vomit-worthy synthesizer soundtrack. What more could you want? I've don't think I've ever seen so much blood in so short a time- Bela Lugosi would have loved to be in this one. The magnificently bright red blu-ray blood spurtage is really first-rate. One guy actually had his head sliced in half- vertically. This should have received an Oscar for special effects. If there's a better film out there, I don't know what it is. This should have made an AFI list somewhere....really....no, really....
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|one of the best angry birds games yet!<br />this one is so fun because there is a little eye thing in the top corner. when you press it the birds poofff away and you shoot a fish..... once you shoot the fish a dragon fallows... killing all the fish!

B006OOHYIC|5.0|fantastic sequel. I honestly can't decide which I like better. I'm actually surprised this hasn't received the amount of reviews as the first.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|I liked this film. Not as good as the original, but this picked up right where the first one left off. I like that. Myers' victims are in the hospital, where Jamie is staying. Myers kills a nurse, a cop, and anyone who gets in his way. After killing the nurse, he stalks Laurie, who just barely escapes. When Michael re-enters the hospital towards the end of the movie by walking through the glass, it's an awesome sight. 3 gunshots from Loomis and Michael falls to his knees, then to the floor. He soon gets up and stalks them after killing the cop. Myers is put out by being burned. After being burned, he still walks for a few moments, before finally falling down.<br /><br />Great sequel IMO.
1583334386|3.0|The book explores various aspects when a person loses self control or willpower.  I am interested in this topic because of my frustration with not reaching my goals in life.  Why do I put off pursuing my dreams?  Although in the end, I don't think it was the lack of self control that gets in the way, I got insights of why I would procrastinate in certain things.  The followings are interesting to me:<br /><br />Self control is limited because it is like a muscle.  If you over-use self control, you will deplete your willpower.  Kelly mentions that by giving your brain more energy using sugar, you will be able to be stronger mentally.  It is a simple trick I will use at around 4:00 pm in my office.<br /><br />The second insight is the function of dopamine.  Dopamine gives a promise of reward.  It is the key for a person's motivation.  If it is used smartly, the promise of reward can be used when we face mundane tasks.  However, the promise of reward does not guarantee happiness.  Having the motivation towards a desire (chocolate cake) does not mean it will lead us to happiness (healthy lifestyle).<br /><br />What-The-Hell effect is interesting.  It explores why people sabotage themselves even more, after they lose willpower.  People feel guilty after they indulge in their vices; they feel guilty, but they refuse to stop right there.  They go, \\"What the hell\\" and continue to do more (e.g. ambling, etc).  In this case, practicing self-forgiving is important.<br /><br />I am so glad that Kelly brought up the topic of hyperopic.  I can relate to that.  I am one who would delay instant gratification until forever.  Unlike most people, I feel that I can't enjoy the presence.  I wish there was more analysis on this topic.  I don't think it is a problem of self-control though.  I suspect it is about self confidence...I like the the websites suggestions Kelly gives to help with self control, for example, FutureMe.org.<br /><br />Last but not least, what drives home for me is the topic of thought suppression.  It is a big problem for me that I have been trying to solve.  I learned that we can't suppress our thoughts and feelings.  Doing so will amplify your feelings.  Two years ago, I had a crush on a guy.  My feelings got stronger every month as I was secretly wishing there was something more to happen. yet, I was suppressing my feelings.  I didn't want to admit it and to tell him my feelings.  Suppressing my feelings led me to occupy my mind with images of him, and prevented me from seeing other guys.  If I have read this book about suppression, I would have gone through the exercises of accepting and let go.  It will save me confusions, anxiety, and shame...<br /><br />The reason I gave it 3 star is that I don't feel there is a tight integration among all the theories to make it one central point. Or, is there no one central point? I found myself jumping from one topic to another and then trying to analyze my situation using the different concepts.

B003V5CFV8|5.0|This has to be one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time.  The trio of protagonists are superb and have great chemistry.  The writing is hillarious and intelligent.  I am so impressed by the quality of this movie.  I have seen this movie 4 times and I laugh each time.  While not appropriate for small children, this movie is very positive and fun!
B000FA57US|5.0|A good, worthy sequel in the series.<br /><br />The film starts with a flashback of the ending to Halloween 4. After that, it's shown here that Michael just barely gets out of the way of the bomb or whatever it was that the cops dropped down the shaft. But he's injured from all the gunshots. A hermit takes care of him. A year later, he kills him. No gratitude from Myers. But what do you expect from someone like Myers, knowing him? He then gets his mask and on he goes for his next collection of victims. He gets a different version of the mask for his film. Jamie, Rachael and her friend (I think her name is Tina) return from the 4th film as does Loomis. In this film, it's revealed that by touching Michael at the end of the previous film, Jamie develops a telepathic link to Myers. She can sense where he is and when he's near. She doesn't speak till later on. While I understand why Loomis kept telling her for help, I felt bad for her. But after Tina's death, she agrees to help. One of, if not the best dialogues is when Myers waits by a tree and Loomis tells him to go home if he wants to stop the evil that will destroy him too and that she'll be there waiting for him. I'm guessing by she, he means Jamie since she is his target.<br /><br />A scary scene is when Myers stalks Jamie, who sees Rachel's dead body and hides. A very, very sick sequence is when when she opens up and falls down a laundry chute, but tries to get back up when he repeatedly stabs it trying to get her. It shows just how sick, relentless, and determined Michael is.<br /><br />One of the best moments and an emotional one is when Jamie says, \\"Uncle.\\" And he stops. She says, \\"Let me see.\\" He removes his mask and you see a tear on his face. Many say it symbolizes that he feels guilty or sad for his actions. You can draw your own conclusion after the revelation of the next film. This only lasts for a second as Michael snaps back into rage mode when Jamie touches him. Had that moment lasted longer, maybe....just maybe that would have been the time for him to say something as he was human and showing emotion for the first time. Another sad scene is Rachel's death. As well as Tina's, who sacrificed herself to save Jamie as both were being stalked by Michael after the Halloween party at the barn Tina went to was finished.<br /><br />Myers is finally stopped when he's trapped and hit by Loomis with a tranquilizer and beats pn him Michael with a wooden object while saying \\"Die.\\" repeatedly. Not the best way to stop him. But it proved effective for the time being. Michael is taken to prison, but is freed by a mysterious Man In Black. More on him will be revealed in the next film.<br /><br />By the way, this is the first and only time I've ever seen Michael kissed. This happens when he wears a different mask and drives Tina to the Halloween party. She kisses him thinking it's her boyfriend. But she gets angry when he doesn't respond to her. After she gets out of the car, he talks off the mask and puts on his Myers mask.just maybe that would have been the time for him to say something as he was human and showing emotion for the first time.

1594203334|3.0|I enjoyed this as a quick and easy read and whilst I wouldn't get too carried away with every aspect of the so-called French style parenting, I though there were some interesting observations. I am Australian and it seems sensible to me that children should be taught to exercise restraint, delay gratification and not think they are the centre of the world. That is how I was brought up. But is that so radically different to the way Americans and other Anglophones  are bringing up their children now. Is that why the so called French style seems so different! The bits in the book where Druckerman gives example of Anglophone parenting seem a bit sad. Like the parent sitting next to the trampoline yelling whoa every time her child has a jump or the parent who ask ridiculous safety questions about the school camp to the mad over scheduling of children which seems a normal in English speaking countries. It is difficult because we all want our kids to succeed and the world does seem a very competitive place now. However I liked the way  the French seem to leave children to be children for as long as possible  I thought there were useful ideas about parenting, although we are all far too obsessed with what the French think... they have problems too.<br /><br />I just like the way French children seem able to behave properly at meals and in public and I don't think that is a bad ideal to aspire to.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|One of my favorite apps!  I love the fact when I get an idea and type it on Evermore it is immediately on my computer, phone and tablet.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Out of all the horror icons, Michael Myers is my favorite. Although he is human, he doesn't show any emotion till later on in the series for like a split second, doesn't ever talk. When he's stabbed, he'll touch wherever he got stabbed to show that he got hurt, but he won't grunt or anything. Only noise coming from him is his breathing. He'll walk and stalk slowly, not run. He does a zombie sit up. And he has supernatural abilities/powers such as superhuman strength and doesn't die. Ever.<br /><br />Originals are often hard or impossible to top. This is no exception. If you wanna good horror/slasher film, this is it.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br /><br />- Young Myers killing his sister. The true highlight of this is the camera style. All you see is a hand putting on a mask, getting a knife and stabbing her. You don't see the young Myers till his parents remove his mask and he shows a blank, emotionless face.<br /><br />- Michael's various sightings at Laurie. Sometimes you see Michael in full. Sometimes you just see his body and not his head. Example: When the 3 boys tease Tommy about The Boogeyman, one of the kids runs into Michael. But you don't see his head as he follows Tommy and gets in a car.<br />There are times you see him in full as he sights Laurie. He sees her while she's in class. She sees him the first time. But when she looks again, he's not there. He drives by in the car looking at her. And sees her again when she goes to the Myers' house, despite Tommy's warning. As she walks with her friend, she sees him looking at her from the bush and hides there and when she gets there, he's not there!<br /><br />- Michael killing Annie's boyfriend and coming to the room with a white thing and glasses. As Annie's on the phone, he slowly walks up, kills her and picks up the phone, hearing Laurie. But he doesn't speak! He simply just listens.<br /><br />- Michael stalking Laurie. Laurie defending herself and the kids, who runs out of the house screaming. Laurie removes the mask revealing a normal human face. But you're so into the character by then, you're like \\"Oh My God\\" shocked to see him unmasked. Loomis waits for him to put the mask back on. I don't know why. Then he shoots him and Michael just stands there, looking and breathing. 5 more shots and he falls off the balcony. But when Loomis goes to check on it, it's gone!<br /><br />- The music. Some of the best music I have heard in any film. THat says a lot considering I've seen countless films and have heard/collected countless scores.<br /><br />- Curtis' and Donald's acting. Both were just tremendous and they can be. And this was Jamie's film debut or breakthrough role. Not sure.emoves the mask revealing a normal human face.

006621131X|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a writer friend who knows I like biographical works by artists. I have heard Patti's music, and I was delighted to find the book as moving and real as her songs. What a wonderful soul she is - every moment of the struggle with Robert and then without him is right there on the page - raw emotion and love that can only be true love. I would love to meet this lady - we had friends in common, and her descriptions of them in their Factory years was like bringing old polaroids to life again. Read this book - it's the artist' s life in all of us!
1564148793|5.0|This review is probably going to rub a few people the wrong way. However, I want to express my unique experience with just a small portion of this book and how it is helping me substantially. Although I don't agree with everything in this book I have to comment on how one of the things I learned in this book has helped me a great deal. I am referring to the banishing ritual that is in Latin and that works with the goddess Hekate in the beginning of the book. I don't know how to express what I am experiencing in a fluid writing style so I am just going to name several points that I have gleaned or noticed since doing this ritual:<br /><br />1)I meditate a lot and get clairvoyant images while doing so. The first thing I noticed after doing this ritual for the first couple of days was how certain energies in my space were pushed away and out. These were not necessarily evil or dark energies but rather energies that like to be in a person's space for a variety of reasons. They're sort of like parasites and are annoyances. I noticed this expulsion of energy the most shortly after retiring for bed at night. With my eyes closed (and still conscious and trying to go to sleep) I saw a lot of energies that were in my 'space' in layers and they became 'dislodged' if you will.<br /><br />2)I've also noticed that I am so much more rational and less emotional. I think this is linked to the first point I just made above. I believe that because I am kicking out a lot of energies in my auric field that aren't me that I am now able to have more of my identity. It's hard to go into detail. But all I can provide as comparison is to imagine living with an awful roommate. This roommate is always in your way, always distracts you and causes you stress. Because of this, you are not yourself and you tend to overreact due to the higher level of stress caused by this person whom you really don't want to have around. Well, this is  how I feel regarding how I am handling life situations these days. I feel as though now that I am banishing energies out of my space that aren't me, I am able to feel more in control of my emotions. Maybe it is a coincidence but I can't help but feel that the banishing ritual in Jason Smith's book had something to do with this.<br /><br />3) I've also noticed that I've become more accepting and to not overreact. This is closely linked to the second point I just stated above. But there is a slight distinction which is profoundly different in my opinion. I won't go into boring examples but let's just say that the things that I had difficulty accepting about myself are now things that I am embracing more. I have somehow come tot he conclusion that some things are the way they are and if it's not possible to change them, either accept them and move on or remain the whiny hot tempered emotional person I was which seems to be a thing of the past.<br /><br />I do this ritual two to three times a day. I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing everything and everyone's name correctly. If not I hope to perfect my pronunciation in time.<br /><br />In contrast to my positive experience above, I don't agree with a lot of what the author says. Miller supports reversing magick so that if a person tries to hurt you, you then try to reverse the energy with the same intent to cause harm to that person. I don't agree with this method and I believe in karma. Defending yourself is not the same as redirecting malicious intent to hurt a person who may want to hurt you.<br /><br />Without getting into a dissertation on my own personal views I will say this: another person's energy can only hurt you if you are emotionally vulnerable to that person, or if this person knows how to tap into your weaknesses. In either case, if I know that another person is directing energy at me with the intent to harm or take my energy it is because I somehow lack a level of ownership over my body and energy. So my approach is to strengthen whatever weaknesses I have in order to become invulnerable to that form of invasion or parasitic attack. And because I have taken this approach I have learned tremendously about myself and have become a much stronger, contented and healed person. I take my spiritual/inner development very seriously. And the help I have gained from doing just the banishing ritual in the beginning this book was well worth the $10 I spent on this book.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|Banks are something like 25% bigger than used to be some our years ago and thanks to their money which controls the Congress. Story of banking system with all the players and how we got where we are today with bigger banks and no reform despite all promises given by this administration. No surprise since there are many other documentaries in regard to banking but none has accomplished what this one has and another one by NPR/Frontline... interviewing the heads of the big league universities who make millions on the side along with all those money loving bankers who use the laws to advantage themselves regardless of the President and his/her party affiliation. Politics at its best. Great interviews. Bravo.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|although I feel i am just scratching the surface of Evernotes potential, its already demonstrated great utility.  ive created and shared ideas and images with others and an archive against data loss.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game ever! People do not know what they are missing! It is very addicting and fun... totally worth it and it is free!!!!!
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I was quite skeptical about this book because of the writing style. I hadn't read a book completely in letter form before but from the positive reviews I decided to give it a go - and absolutely loved it. I suggested to my mother-in-law and friends to read it and they loved it too. It was also featured on the ABC radio book reading segment<br />just after I finished it- so I got to hear it again. A lovely story of friendship and love, now thats one island I'd be happy to be marooned on!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Yes, I'm glad I read it but it was a bit disappointing. One wants more detail on the action. Fair enough he may not be able to say exactly where it was but more detail of the situation would have been welcome. As a kid I remember having a lot of fun plugging mice off a telephone wire they used as a highway. Afterwards it became routine so that part of the book is understandable. Although interesting, I did not buy the book for so many intimate details of his private life. Nevertheless I admire his achievements and, as others have said, great shooters do not make great writers.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I had not heard anything about this film until I saw it at a Redbox.  I got it because of the cast.  I figured it had to be good with that line-up, and it was.  It's really the first original film to come out of Hollywood in a long time.  The object of the characters' pursuit is birding and winning the competition for most bird sightings in a year.<br /><br />I'm familiar with birding but I more from the English way of doing things.  I had no idea that in America it was almost a sport.  What an intriguing idea for a film and so well done. I highly recommend it.  I liked it so much I'm going to buy the DVD from Amazon.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|What can I say about this book without giving away spoilers?    Well first and foremost, I think that I can say that this book was totally unique. It's hard to find a unique story in romance. I mean everything has been done in some fashion. But this book did what others do not. This book took you to places you wouldn't think an author would dare. To suggest that this romance was a disaster is an understatement. Should these two people be together, maybe not? But that is what made the story so intriguing. She went to uncharted ground and I loved every minute of it. This book is another shining example of a book that you be traditionally published.    The bottom line: Should you read this story? YES! With no hesitation.  When should you read this story? NOW. Don't wait.    If you want to read something fresh and unconventional this story is it. No it's not paranormal. No it's no an average romance. It's just a refreshing read about two unlikely people who fall for each other at college. They will not fall in love and live happily ever after. They have a long road to bare and that's the journey you will be immersed in.    I recommend to mature audiences for violence, language and sexual situations.    See my full review on my blog: [...]

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This one really grabbed me.  It reminded me of the same emotions I had watching [[ASIN:B001TOD6N4 Taking Chance]](also recommended). This movie was harder to watch the second time, but man, do I love this film.  I am a retired Chief who served on submarines.  Everything I saw that related to my career was absolutely accurate.  I imagine the rest of the film was just as credible.  I sure admire these military folks!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|WOW AMAZING FANTASTIC MIND BLOWING BEST BOOK EVER    To read or not to read, may be a question many of you may ask yourself. And let me tell you, you'd be crazy not to read if you enjoy romance novels.    Is this a conventional romance novel? NO! Does the lifestyle our hero live conform to the average persons. MAYBE NOT. But don't let that stop you from reading this book. This book is more than that. It's about overcoming oneself, stripping to the core of who you are. What this couple must face to find and be with one another is nothing short of writing brilliance.    The story is very well written with well developed characters. This is the kind of book that will keep you up all night reading. Is it just that good? YES! I wish I could give it more stars or put it in a category all its own.    Too say more would give too much away. But I will say that if I could bring one fictional character to life, it would be Christian Grey.    *bows down to E. L. James* You have created a story that will go down in history as one of the best love stories ever written.    See my full review on my blog:[...]

1469984202|5.0|the book(s) are done. The last time I had this feeling after a book was after reading Kingbird Highway. Except during the reading of Wool I couldn't put it down as opposed to reading something else while reading KB hwy to prolong it.<br />I didn't want Wool to end, I even read about 20 reviews after I finished to savor it.<br />I believe we will see that tough lady Jules again, but if we don't it's all good, as the story finished great -Just the kind of ending that would play great in a movie. The last movie I saw at the theater was Lord of the rings - I would definitely go see Wool on the big screen. BTW - this is my first \\"review\\" and thanks Hugh, for an enjoyable experience.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I can't stress how much of a letdown this book was. I finished the first two installments of this trilogy in a couple days each...and this one was so painful to read that it took almost a month. Without giving away too many spoilers, about half of this book is spent with Katniss incapacitated in some way (imprisoned, in the hospital, in a drug coma, or just hysterical). By far, the biggest strike against \\"Mockingjay\\" is that Collins apparently got extremely lazy towards the end (maybe she was as tired of the story by that point as I was) and writes off or forgets several key characters in only a few sentences each. Not to mention the way she sloppily skims over several crucial events (i.e. the conclusion of the rebellion) and skips ahead weeks, months, even years throughout the book. If you're to this point in the series you should read this one just to get the \\"closure\\", but don't expect this trilogy to ever be considered a classic.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I've been wanted to watch this movie.  But when I look on line, it was too expensive to buy it. I decided to rent it instead. It was funny and touching. I've connected the computer to my big screen TV, it was just like watch it on the DVD. Wort every penny.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|One of the chapters consists of diagrams of various geometric shapes with writing in those shapes and lines connected to those shapes. They don't fill the page and are quite impossible to read in the Kindle (3G) model--too small, too faint, and fonts too \\"unsmoothed.\\" I suspect that chapter was pretty key ... but I skipped it. The ploy seems like a legitimate one--a young girl's sorting out her family and their relationships (mildly autistic brother and parents we've met in earlier life stages in different stories). But on the whole, not for me a compelling read.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Love the show but, unfortunately, it leaves out the nice, big battles from the books. That's probably due to the budget but it is still a good show and nice adaptation of the book.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I love the secrecy, rumored conspiratorial plots and pseudo science woven in that Brown plays with and can't wait for more from him. My advice to his pretentious detractors, by the way, non of whom have recognizable names in modern American fiction. If you haven't sold anything, much less finished that brilliant, heart stopping novel rotting away in a bottom drawer since high school. Cut the guy some slack and just enjoy Brown's work for what it is Popular fiction.

1863514260|5.0|I thought this was going to be yet another book trying to teach me the color wheel and various analogous or split-complementary harmonies. How wonderful that it's not!<br /><br />The first few chapters are basics of Trish Burr, fabric, needles, shading, etc.<br /><br />Then the rest of the first half of the book is full color lists of DMC thread colors that go together..with DMC numbers. Page after pager of colors that combine. No color wheels! no harmonies! For some, she stitched a flower with each petal showing various colors shaded and/or combined (with DMC numbers given). You want an antique effect, turn to the antique page and there are stitched color combinations to chose from. Not sure what colors you want, leaf through the full color pages until you find a combination that calls to you.<br /><br />The second half of the book is projects. I do have a small issue with Ms. Burr's projects, both in this book and in Needle Painting. I have found numerous projects that tell you to stitch every flower petal in A, B, C, D order. Yet the stitched example by Ms. Burr is not in that order, she mixes up the colors on her pieces, while the project directions clearly have you do each petal the same. Only after my first project clearly was not looking like her's, did I see how she tells you to do one thing, while doing another. I don't do a lot of other peoples art, so while I find it odd that she'd do this, and question why, it's not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that the book is much bigger than I thought. I expected something the size of Needle Painting. This is big. In full color. With wonderful paper that I find myself gliding my hands over. Wonderful.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|The pictures of the items on my kindle fire are very small. why cant you make the app like the ipad ebay app where you can see the items big.
B0009FTXGI|3.0|I recently acquired the amazing EF-S 10-22mm. On a couple of occasions I noticed some flare so I decided to get the hood, but mostly to offer the lens extra protection. I was very reluctant to dish out over 30$ for the OEM Canon hood (as most of you reading this would be). The Opteka and Fotodiox alternatives seemed too cheap, so i went for this Adorama version. It feels flimsy and both the material and build quality are cheap but i'm not complaining it only cost 10$. Now keep in mind that it is a wide hood. It fits on 77mm wide-angle lenses, so by design it has to be wide. I measured 11.2 cm in diameter. I uploaded pictures for you to see. The lens would not fit in my bag with the hood on, but that's not really the hood's fault. One reviewer mentioned that he managed to attach it in reverse. I tried, and I had to twist REALLY HARD. It finally went in, but I wouldn't do it again. The regular forward fit is looser as a result, and I am not comfortable applying this much torsion on my expensive lens. It's disappointing that it doesn't easily fit in reverse, but even if it did, the lens still wouldn't fit in my bag compartment with the hood attached in reverse so there's no point wrestling with it every time.<br /><br />Will it do its job of preventing flare and protecting your expensive lens? Yes.<br />Is it a better deal than the original Canon? Yes.<br />Is it a better deal than the cheaper Opteka and Fotodiox? I don't know.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

B001NLV1NK|4.0|This was a very good buy.  I got the blue ray version that came with the joker mask.  I absolutely love it.  I did not know about the batman mask version at the time, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway cause I love the joker one better.  My only complaint is that the hinge disk holder stays in was broken when I received it.  That is why I gave it a four star rating.  The disk was still in the holder so no fowl.  Overall it was a great buy.
1423140591|3.0|I find greek mythology to be very fascinating. Its what caught my interest with the original percy jackson series.<br />I've come to be a huge fan and own all of them! I read book one with an open mind to new characters and a new story, I enjoyed it. So of course, I'd read book two. I was really disappointed with this book. Although the books are geared toward \\"young adult,\\" the pervious books could be enjoyed by anyone. I felt the dialogue between the characters was very obnoxious in this one. It made the book difficult to read at times. I wasnt a big fan of the new characters introduced and even Percy didn't seem like Percy. They had no depth or development. It didnt really matter to me what happened to them, I never became attached. I will probably pass on the next one because of it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book is amazing!!!!!! I have been working on my personal development this last year which included listening to the CD's that come with SUSSESS Magazine so when I heard about The Compound Effect I committed myself to make the investment. WOW!!! After finishing the book I have started my own success company [...] and my blog [...]. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!
B0061QD82E|5.0|Picked up this collection while out shopping for the same price. Outstanding movie! Will always be a timeless classic from Disney.<br />Can't really tell the difference between blu-ray and the regular dvd though as it is taken from the original film which of course was not digital. Have come to realize that most titles that were not filmed in digital originally do not benefit much from transferring to blu-ray if at all. Not really worth the extra money to have a blu-ray edition. Save your money when buying dvd of older titles.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|This seems to be the worst master of the wall to my ears.  The best you can trust is Japan 1st press 50DP and 40DP or even MFSL 24 karat gold cd.  For those you did not know there're way better sound quality of the wall before they were remastered again and again in 1994, 1997 and 2011.  Hunting down the old master while you still can.
B004XISI4A|5.0|This is a \\"can't put down\\" story I have enjoyed every book of this series and can't wait for the next one to be finished.<br />The characters come to life in this epic story of the struggle to live their lives amongst the upheaval of wars and treachery of the Kings and Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. A great read.
B003L7861E|3.0|If you like food, the book is a lot of fun.  If you love Indian and French food it's even more fun.  I enjoyed the story but it fizzled out for me.  I don't want to give the story line away.  I can say I remember the first half of the book very well.  The second half was a bit of a drag.  Still worth reading for those who consider themselves \\"foodies.\\"
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I have to admit I'm encouraged by a re-emergence of quality acts rising in the music world within the last several years. Muse, Mumford and Sons, Florence and the Machine, My Chemical Romance, Adele. And now Fun. Like many, my first exposure to this group was \\"We Are Young\\".  This song is incredibly damn good.  I imagine it will be a huge hit, an emblem of the year 2012.  For me, this song is as captivating as the first time I was turned on to Smells Like Teen Spirit.  I wore that song out playing it over and over on a cassette tape I recorded off the radio. We Are Young may have been designed for mass consumption, but so what.  Maybe more should aspire to that end.<br /><br />To me, the album kind of feels like a blend of Queen and MGMT. Not that it has to be pigeon holed into a specific category.  It's just full of really good, catchy pop tunes.  Most songs stand very well on their own, even though in my opinion We Are Young is the strongest track.  \\"Some Nights\\" \\"Why am I the One\\" \\"All Alright\\" and \\"All Alone\\" are great.  The two weakest tracks come near the end, \\"One Foot\\" and \\"Stars\\".  The first time I heard \\"One Foot\\" I thought it was Eminem. It's an odd song that doesn't sit well with the rest of the album.  Neither does \\"Stars\\".  That one starts out well enough then devolves into an annoying Kanye like autotune/voice manipulator sound.<br /><br />The production.  This is like a hip-hop meets pop album.  Hip Pop?  Why not.  It works.<br /><br />Aside from the two weak tracks, this is a nearly perfect album.  I highly recommend it to any music fans, regardless of tastes.<br /><br />Update 4/14: I've gone back and listened to all of Nate Ruess' work, i.e. Format, \\"Aim and Ignite\\".  This is their best work yet.  All the elements of strong song writing are present in previous works, but they hadn't quite converged into anything masterful until now.  Some Nights has been played over and over on my songlist, and it's probably one of the best albums I've owned.  Yougot to get it.
1416589473|5.0|I have never played Guild Wars, but because I have heard about the upcoming Guild Wars 2 I thought I'd give the book a shot; turned out to be a great idea! I love the book. I finished it within two days, which with my schedule was quite a feat, but I had a hard time putting it down. Bought the second book, polished that one off in another two days. Now I am (not so) patiently waiting for the third book in the series to come out. I would suggest this book to any fan of the genre as well as Edge of Destiny.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Congratulations to George Martin for continuing this great Adventure into the historical world of the Seven Kingdoms.<br />I have just started the next book \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and it is just as good as the other ones in this series \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\"<br />These books have all the excitement, action and intrigue that any lover of Fantasy could hope for. Great read.

B004P98QZ8|5.0|Lego Ninjago Fire Temple is a must have for any fan of Lego. The Fire Dragon and Fire Temple are both excellent display models with hours of play features for children. So this set is good for both children and AFOL's!<br /><br /> The Dragon build is very simple and goes by quick. The Fire Temple actually is more technical to build because the entire Temple splits open in the middle and opens, much like a sliding door,that springs open, revealing the Fire Dragon. This extra play feature requires lots of parts, and I'm always impressed with Lego when the build is finished and this technical play feature is no exception! The Kids might need help with this but if they are patient and follow directions, it proves a simple challenge.<br /><br /> A great feature this set has is that all the Japanese written elements on the bricks/windows in this set are printed on the brick. This set has no stickers! The Japanese for those of you that don't know translates into \\"Peace Dragon\\" \\"Dragons of the peaceful world\\" \\"Dragons of Peace\\" or \\"peaceful Dragons\\".<br /><br />The 7 minifigures included in this set are awesome. This set includes VHTF minifigures of Kya, Samukai, and Sensei Wu. Zane, Kai,Krunsha and Garmadon are also included in this set and even these figures are getting Hard to find. So in my opinion, this is a great set for Ninjago Minifigures.<br /><br />Amazon currently has one of the best prices for Fire Temple. For $119.99 MSRP this set is a must buy!

B002GHIPYI|5.0|These are some really impressive semi open headphones, considering the economical price. The range is and balance of the sound is poifect. The bass isn't overpowering like many of the other pairs of headphones that I have owned, and that is mostly due to the fact that they are semi-open. The quality of the sound is very crisp and natural, and tends to let small noises within recordings to be noticeable. These work for a range of tasks too. I've used them monitoring recordings of mine, and I've used them for hardcore dragon slaying in Skyrim. I love these so much. They immerse one in sound instead of shoving it straight into ones ears. GREAT buy. They feel like clouds. Super light with good cushioning. Only problem is that the cord is very long and not practical for listening to an ipod and walking around.
B0068TL23G|2.0|This game is a lot of fun, and worked great on my old Incredible. Just upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus, and now I can't get the settings to save. They keep getting reset to default. The sound is pretty annoying, and having it on every time I play the game is quite obnoxious. Once bug is fixed, app gets a 5/5.

B00001QEE6|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is one hour and fifteen minutes and was released in theaters on June 22nd, 1955 and was the 15th animated feature film from Walt Disney Studios. The movie tells the story of two dogs from very different up bringing. Lady is a female Cocker Spaniel that is own by Jim Dear and Darling and lives in a middle to upper class suburbs. Tramp is a strayed mutt that lives life day by day and has no permanent home. The two meet up when Tramp is in her next of the woods and Lady is upset because Jim Dear and Darling have been treating her coldly. Jock and Trusty try to calm Lady by telling her that Darling is having a baby and explaining what a baby is. Tramp tells his version in somewhat of a negative way. Soon after the baby is born, Jim Dear and Darling go on a little trip and Aunt Sarah comes with her two Siamese cats (named Si and Am). Aunt Sarah dislikes dogs and when she finds the room a mess and her pet cats faking injuries she blames Lady and set out to get a muzzle for her. Lady does not like the muzzle and escapes with it on. She is trapped by some tough street dogs, but Tramp comes to the rescue and saves her. Tramp shows Lady what life is like without the collar and eventually winds up at Tonys' Restaurant. The next day Lady finally arrives home after being caught and sent to the dog pound. While chained to a dog house she spots a rat and tries to scare it away, but is unable to; Tramp shows up and Lady tells him that there is a rat in the baby's room. Tramp is able to kill the rat, but Aunt Sarah seeing the crib knocked over believes Lady and the Tramp are responsible and locks Tramp in a closet and puts lady in the basement. Aunt Sarah calls up the local dog pound and they take Tramp to the dog pound. Jim Dear and Darling come home and lady shows them what really happened showing them the dead rat. Jock and Trusty feeling bad that they misjudged Tramp, go after them. The two catch up to the horses and buggy and are able to stop them, but Trustyis severely hurt. In the next scene it is Christmas, Lady and the Tramp are \\"married\\" and have puppies of their own and Trusty is has a cast on his right front paw.<br /><br />Lady and the Tramp was the first animated movie filmed in Cinemascope and since not all movies carried Cinemascope it was also made in the standard Academy ratio. In the scene where Trusty was hurt badly the script was to have him die, but Walt Disney fearing negative reaction that he got from Bambi scrapped the idea and in the next scene Trusty is shown recovering from the accident. This was Disney's most expensive film at that time beating out Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Lady and the Tramp gets an AAAAA+++++.<br /><br />DVD FEATURES<br /><br />Chapter Selection<br />Set Up<br />1. Languages<br />a. English<br />b. French<br />c. Spanish<br />2.

0439023513|4.0|I found the final book in the Hunger Games series to be good, but just not as good as the original book. I always got the feeling that the first book was originally written to stand alone and then it did so well Collins was told to turn it into a trilogy. But maybe not. I found the general story good, with some unexpected twists-- I really enjoyed seeing how the resistance takes shape. But the ending, even before the climax of the story, really feels somewhat rushed. The epilogue especially is rushed- 1 page to resolve the major PTSD those characters would have? Just didn't seem to do the rest of the series justice. But its worth finishing out the series.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It is such a shame that we have so few movies that discuss or promote Christian values. \\"Mainstream\\" Hollywood seems almost afraid to touch these subjects. If a blockbuster movie has people who identify themselves as Christians, you can almost bet at some point they'll become the villains or be portrayed as hypocrites. And here comes \\"Courageous\\" from the same guys that gave us \\"Facing the Giants\\" and \\"Fireproof\\", movies that want to buck that trend and show a positive side of Christianity.<br /><br />Many of the people who have written 1 star reviews are clearly not interested in anything that promotes Christian values. The idea of a movie openly discussing Christianity and what God tells us is our role as a father in teaching our values and religion to our children is somehow a terrible thing.<br /><br />And the reviews claiming that this film is somehow negative in its portrayal of women, that's just laughable. Perhaps the movie could have been more complex and had something more for women, but then both would have been diluted and not as effective.<br /><br />I've seen this twice now. First in theaters, now on the DVD that I bought. I'm happy to support a film that sponsors the very best in Christian values: love, redemption, faith, forgiveness.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No. Is it Oscar-worthy acting? No. Although it's not nearly as bad as others seem to claim. Is it necessarily going to convert someone to Christianity, or to pay more attention to their faith and their responsibilities as a father or mother? Only if they're willing to listen.
B004EPZ00C|2.0|I just finished watching this.<br /><br />I hate say it, but something went wrong here?<br />No where as funny as the first .<br /><br />Johnny English Reborn is kinda a failed satire .<br />As much as I like Rowan, Aka, Mr Bean.<br /><br />They story is trying to be edgey... with character that far from it.<br /> Things were too fast paced in this. All characters seemed rather dull.<br />There was too much editing in this movie. proof is having about 20 mintues of<br />deleted scenes that were more funny than movie.<br />Director wanted edgey, faster, movie. Well he got it.<br />The result is just 2 stars rating.<br />I think this the final Johnny English.
0330449605|5.0|I so loved this book and Kate Morton's writing style.  I could barely put this book down as I found myself wanting to know more and more of the mystery.  I will definitely be reading her other books!
0439023491|4.0|Forewarning, there may be a slight spoiler in this review!<br /><br />As a middle book of a trilogy, Catching Fire does pretty well. This book lays on the love triangle and inner conflict a lot more than the first book. However, I'm a huge fan of this book's 'Games' and the arena... very interesting. This book also introduces some of my favorite secondary characters of the series.<br /><br />If you were left wanting more at the end of the first book, Catching Fire is a worthwhile read. If you do read this book though, have Mockingjay on stand-by-- it ends on a total cliffhanger and you'll want to start the next book immediately.
B003V5HWWA|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Bought this one to upgrade from VHS to DVD.  Grandkids love it as much as my kids did

1594203334|5.0|I have been a nanny and family assistant for over 15 years. I have seen every kind of family dynamic and parenting styles you can imagine. I love this book. I love that she points out that what americans consider the norm (screaming, impatient, demanding children) doesn't have to be the norm. I love that she gives simple points to remember such as simply waiting to see if our child can settle themselves down before you rush in to do it for them. American parents do seem to think they are neglecting their children if they make them wait at all but this is a life skill that has to be learned. I reccomend reading this book even if it is just to see that there are other ways of parenting that will give you a calmer life where you can set your children and families up for success and happiness.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|ok, first you must sit through about 10 minutes of stupid commercials and poor quality film previews.  you cannot skip them.<br /><br />secondly, this version is PC.  they switched some characters out and made them female.  i mean, how could you switch out the sake drinking doctor and replace him with an Eviane drinking female?  it doesn't work.  and they made Yuki some ace fighter pilot who knocks guys out with one punch!  i forget who she replaced, but it was the black tigers team leader.<br /><br />the gamilon ships looked nothing like in the cartoon.  just the typical \\"make the ships look evil...you know, plant-cyborg hybrids...and insect like!\\"<br /><br />this movie, like another said, follows the plot, but that's about it.  they got as creative with the rest of the story as ridley scott gets with historv.<br /><br />they should've left this as a cartoon.<br /><br />don't even rent this.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This film really loves people and made me love almost every character, whether main or not. And generally, it doesn't seem like actors acting. Quite often it feels like you're walking along with Amelie and meeting real people with her. Many movies try to be quirky but it turns into an irritating mess. This film is quirky in a good way, in a stylish, romantic, energizing way. It feels more mature than typical Hollywood chick flicks. And there is much wonderful humor. There are a few explicit (brief and humorous) sexual scenes, so wait til the kids go to a slumber party.
B002AS463W|1.0|Beware!  This is without question thee most inferior DVD that I have ever purchased and viewed!  I only comment on DVD picture & sound quality and leave the drama reviews to others.<br /><br />I am well aware of the artistic significance of this 1986 film, yet I cannot believe that director Adrian Lyne and Warner Brothers could be proud of, or even allow to be sold, a disc of garbage that this is.  It proves they are just out to make a buck and have no pride.<br /><br />I'm not too familiar with all the production details of the film and at this point I do not care.  I know it took a big loss when it was released theatrically; I also recall that I rented it on VHS tape in the late 80's and as I remember it looked a LOT better than this DVD.  Warner Bros. made no attempt to clean it up at all.  I would not be surprised to learn that the source material was a beat-up VHS tape to produce this DVD.<br /><br />If you really are considering this DVD, let me tell you that the \\"widescreen\\" version is a mini-picture, so you are probably better off watching the full-screen flipside version since it is actually larger.  I can only assume this was Lyne's college student film or maybe his high school project as it looks like it was shot on Super 8.<br /><br />$17-million budget... hmmm... where was the money spent?  Someone please tell me.  The filmmakers certainly did not hire a script supervisor as there are continuity errors galore.  The sound would be appropriate for an 80's film with no attempt at restoration or enhancement.<br /><br />The longest I can watch of this DVD at one time is about 30 minutes before I get bored... there is just not enough production quality to tolerate it as a motion picture.  Again, I can't believe that Warner Bros. and Lyne would put this crap out but they did.  Evidently they view the film as a \\"loser\\", and it is.<br /><br />Oh, if all this were not enough, you may have difficulty getting the \\"widescreen\\" version side to even function in your DVD player.  I have to eject and re-insert it several times.  Junk.<br /><br />Seeing Kim Basinger is great, but there are many other films to see her in than in this dump of a DVD.  I'm glad I got it at a bargain price... still a waste of money.  Lots of older films have been restored to a condition that is enjoyable to watch.  This film is not one of them.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|This is by far the best sounding singing group I have heard in the last 10 years.  They may be young but i don't think they will become the groups that later break up and think they're bigger than God like many have done.  They've produced a sound all of their own and doesn't have any of the snooty pop sound in it.  I follow the British X-Factor WAY more the the American one.  There is a big difference in the quality that is produced.
1452101248|5.0|I'm not a vegetarian, but who doesn't need a little bit more nutrition in their diet?  The only thing is, I HATE traditional vegetarian dishes.  They either seem to be trying to replicate meat in the most chemical way possible or are bland and boring.  This book certainly changed my mind on both counts.<br /><br />None of the recipes in this book attempt to be meat recipes.  These are truly vegetable recipes, and you will not be looking for the chicken breast that seems to have been forgotten.  They are filling and complete as meals.  Also, these recipes are actually tasty and interesting, with good spices and textures.  No more boring tofu dishes or recipes with textured vegetable protein or seitan.<br /><br />I've made three dishes so far: spicy Moroccan carrot salad, sweet potato cakes, and mushroom and herb polenta.  Every single one turned out exactly as the recipe stated and every single one was delicious.  I didn't even give the carrot salad a chance to cool - I ate it warm out of the pan because it smelled so good.  The sweet potato cakes were a little soft, but a little more flour in the mix would probably solve that issue.  The mushroom polenta recipe used Taleggio cheese, which I now know that I dislike (since it smells and tastes like dirty gym socks), but I would definitely make it again with a different cheese.<br /><br />My only gripe about the book is the same one I'm seeing in a lot of other cookbooks recently.  Some of the recipes call for \\"1 red chile\\" or something equally vague.  Pray tell, what species of chile is the chef referring to?  I live in Texas, and there are a multitude available.  The red chiles available at the store yesterday were: red jalapeno, Fresno, Thai, and some sort of red banana pepper.  I finally decided it was probably one of those tiny Thai chiles that come in green or red, but who knows for sure?  I like specifics, and if you don't think we can find it in America, maybe some substitutes.  Or at least give me a spice level, and I'll try to find one on my own.<br /><br />Overall, a beautiful book.  The pictures will have you drooling as I was.  The recipes are easy to read (black ink on white paper).  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, as many of the recipes are pretty simple.l, and I'll try to find one on my own.<br /><br />Overall, a beautiful book.

0375869026|5.0|A number of years ago, the Discovery Health Channel had a special on called \\"Born Without a Face\\" featuring a little girl, Juliana, who was born with massive facial anomalies and disfigurements (Treacher Collins Syndrome). My little girl was about the same age as Juliana and I remember being so touched and torn by the struggles of the family and Juliana but the overwhelming love from everyone around her. What I remember most was a shot of her from the back -- she looked like any normal little girl with perfect little girl arms, neck and body. Then we see her face, a horrible array of misplaced parts and malformed facial structures. But what I quickly realized was that she was just like my daughter, beautiful, playful and needed every opportunity in life like everyone else.<br /><br />So when I read Wonder, I often thought of Juliana and how she must be doing at age 9 or 10, just like August Pullman. Auggie is a terrific 10-year old who had never had to go to a regular school. He is just like every other young boy except that his face is severely deformed. And so Wonder begins when Auggie begins his life in a 'public' school in fifth grade. The great thing about this book is not only the warmth and greatness of Auggie but the journey that everyone else goes through as they get to know him -- all the things that make him so great -- all the things that his mom, dad and sister have known all their life.<br /><br />The author had a terrific way of delving us into everyone's thoughts as the book changes perspective periodically to tell the story (sometimes a repetition of events) from the viewpoint of another person in Auggie's life. We hear from Auggie's sister and friends which gives us a peek into the minds and struggles of those around him.<br /><br />It was a terrific read and it made me cry, not always because of the difficulties that Auggie went through but more from the perspective of his mother, who was caught between sheltering him and setting him free. I felt her tears, her strength, and everything else that a mom goes through as their kids get a little older, a little more independent and a little less needy (but still always coming home for that safe spot in mom's arms.)<br /><br />I've given it to my son to read and I think he'll devour it. It's seems that it would be appealing for many age groups but it is written for the 8 and up crowd.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone, young, old, and everything in between.her tears, her strength, and everything else that a mom goes through as their kids get a little older, a little more independent and a little less needy (but still always coming home for that safe spot in mom's arms.)<br /><br />I've given it to my son to read and I think he'll devour it.

1583334386|5.0|I bought this book after having read a mention of it in February's Marie Claire magazine [or was it Oprah?].  I used to pride myself on my willpower and self discipline but ever since having kids I have liteally none.  The book helped me realize that the solution was much, much simpler than what I'd conventionally thought of as \\"willpower\\" and was more about adjusting your life to support the vision you have of yourself.  Before reading the book I couldn't even remember what I used to be like - all I knew was that I was thinner, happier, more organized and felt more in control.  I'm absolutely not back there yet but I can envision what it is going to look like when I get there.  Plus, McGonigal's approach is forgiving so that when you do slip up, you don't feel completely defeated.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|As everyone else has said, this is a great story that is well written.  I downloaded the first Wool for free, then bought the Omnibus Edition.  I'm sure that I'll be looking at more books by Hugh Howey.  I read a lot of science fiction and this story kept my attention.  The plot was not predictable.  This is saying a lot as most post apocalyptic stories remind me of other stories I have read.  Wool definitely keeps you guessing as to what comes next.  The plot also stays true to the Wool world.  By this I mean that there are no cheap advancements such as someone finding a magic lamp with a genie to grant 3 wishes.  Everything is consistent with the Wool world.<br /><br />My compliments also for the editing.  I haven't had my Kindle long, yet I've noticed the poor to atrocious editing (or non-editing) of many of the books.  Anyway, buy this book!  Then look for others by Hugh Howey!
B00009W0U4|2.0|I was curious enough to watch this movie even though I had reservations, since I am so easily affected and bothered by viewing violence. I went ahead anyway when I read the reviews comparing it to Memento, which I really liked. I am very fond of movies that I can't figure out the first time, and the idea of a reversed order of sequences from end to beginning appealed to me on this one despite the subject matter of violent rape, and revenge. The spinning camera effects sounded interesting. I like experimental and artistic films, and am particularly fond of French films.<br /><br />The movie starts out with very dizzying type spinning camera rotations and angles, often focusing up at the ceiling in a dark cavernous space. The camera twirls while it also follows two men running through various winding rooms, up and down stairs in a huge S&M club for gay men called \\"The Rectum\\". The two men are highly agitated, since they are looking for the man who raped and beat a woman they both love. This is some very novel and experimental footage. It's why I am even giving it two stars.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with it, is that I thought the depictions of violence were oddly distancing. I did not end up caring about any of the characters. I wasn't even particularly bothered by the beginning of the film which starts with a murder scene. One of the main characters ends up smashing a guys head in with a fire extinguisher. It almost looks like he's smashing a pumpkin. I thought, hey, he should have stopped after two blows, because he just needed to disable him. If he murders the guy, then several lives will be ruined. That's all that went through my mind, and usually I am upset if there is something as minor as a scraped knee. Someone else stated in their review that it was because the spinning was so distracting and dizzying that it took away our ability to make a moral judgment. I hope that's why I had the reaction that I did...I ended up feeling disturbed that I didn'tfeel much of anything, or care about the characters. My take on the movie is that the director, and probably the writer, were enjoying the depictions of violence. The name of the movie should be IRRESPONSIBLE instead of Irreversible.<br /><br />Also,I was very distracted by the way the woman character was dressed. I kept wondering how she could go out of the house wearing those particular party clothes. I puzzled about whether her slip dress was designed with a certain kind of seam, so that it looked like she was excited and her nipples were constantly standing at attention. The cover of the movie focuses on this. You wonder if the actress is clothed or naked, or sports a farmers tan. I know how she was dressed had nothing to do with her rape, but I kept wondering how she go out looking so vulnerable, and why the people at the party she attended didn't seem to notice. In the United States men would definitely be fixated on her chest.<br /><br />There is hardly any character development in this movie. When there is dialogue it all seems to have to do with sex, or characters are screaming almost incoherently, and threatening other people. The whole movie is gratuitous sex and violence. I didn't come away with any \\"wow\\" that affected me kind of feeling. I think rape is a detestable and hideous crime, but the rape scene didn't bother me at all even though it went on for 10 minutes. I was disturbed by the brutality of what happened immediately afterward, but in a very dispassionate kind of way. None of it seemed real to me, even though I think the actors did a good job. Maybe all the erratically moving camera angles and footage was just too disorienting, or maybe it's because everything happened out of sequence. I don't like how the movie made you feel like violence is not as disturbing or wrong as it really is.

B001EW5FIK|4.0|I tend to choose tarot decks based solely on aesthetics. With most, it's a bit of a process. I pick them up, turn them over and over in my hands, put them down, walk away. I'll go home and think about it. Do I really need another deck of cards right now? Can I find them used? I'll go back to the store and pretend to browse other things in the same general area, all the while knowing that I'm having a man versus self moment.<br /><br />The day I purchased these cards, there was no decision process. I picked up the box and never put it down. It was either pay for it or a misdemeanor. Included in the set are the card deck, instruction booklet, and spread poster.<br /><br />The illustrations on the cards are best described as modern surrealism. As the name suggests, the moon is featured and visible on each of the seventy-eight cards in the pack. The pack also contains a title card as well as information about the artist. The illustrations themselves are bright, bold, dynamic, and intriguing. On a few occasions, I've found myself being drawn in to the vignettes. Each card features an illustration. Some of the traditional archetypes of the tarot are portrayed, but each card has its own story and personality. The cards are very reminiscent of the films of Neil Gaiman (Mirrormask, Neverwhere).<br /><br />The deck size and card weight is fairly standard. The card corners are slightly rounded, the cards shuffle well, and they are fairly easy to manage.<br /><br />As someone who's been reading cards for over twenty years, I would not necessarily recommend the cards to someone starting out. Because the artwork differs so greatly from the Rider-Waite deck (which seems to be the standard deck used for learning card interpretation), it may be a little daunting to adjust to the slightly sinister nature of this pack. The instruction booklet is generic at best. Beyond the author's dedication, the information is pretty standard across all decks produced by US Games.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is actually re&agrave;lly cool because you can design the restaurant and you can make the food you want to make.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think the game is a great way to pass time, the games are a challenge and fun to play. for a free game its good.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Enjoyed the book, learn a lot about Steve Jobs. Brillant man but in so many ways had no common sense. For example his diet , going barefooted, not have surgery  at an earlier date.His temper and foul language to other co-workers was insane. He had all the money in the world but he was not a Christian. So sad.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The biggest flaw in this book is the premise for the story.  We are to assume people keep on having kids and keep on giving them up for annual killfests in this morally depraved dystopia??  The author talks of previous rebellions and the destruction of District 13, but I'm afraid the reader needs more than something that happened historically to believe in this nonsense.  The author builds nothing in the immediate other than Gale's disgust with Capitol and the Avox couple who ran away from Capitol.  I expected the story to unfold where our heroine figures out a weakness in Capitol that she might use in rebellion in later books.  I really thought name choices were ridiculous: Katniss? Gale? Prim?  I mean I know we're in the future ...  And the muttations in the end were absolutely 1970s Star Trek LAUGHABLE.<br /><br />Basic storytelling: Every story has a protagonist and an antagonist.  In this story the antagonist is the city of Capitol with it's brutal regime of starving people and its annual killsfest of CHILDREN.  A story arc must follow the protagonist's adventure of standing up against the antagonist and having some kind of victory.  One might argue that Katniss suicide bluff to save Peeta's life and her winning the Hunger Games was her victory.  But that is only a victory on the antagonist's terms.  It is no victory whatsoever for the brutal regime that continues.  One must look at this book on its own, not as part of a trilogy.  On its own, it offers no hint of hope for the people of the Districts and I think that's a serious flaw in the plot.<br /><br />I also felt the whole fake-a-romance for the audience thing was silly.  Imagine, if you will, a world where depraved people enjoy watching children kill one another. You have to be sociopathic. Would those same people also want to see a romance unfold?  Since Collins doesn't paint her antagonist very clearly these inconsistencies are hard to swallow.<br /><br />Young Adult Fiction is the largest growing genrein literature, since Harry Potter and the Twilight series.  Sadly, since children and young adults are psychologically still figuring out how to manage their emotions and figuring out their identity, they're going to eat this sensationalistic crap up like it's candy.  Another reviewer put it perfectly by saying this book is like candy floss that melts on your tongue and never quite makes it to the stomach.  100% agreed !!  I think I'll save myself time and just read the plot synopsis for Collins other two books on Wikipedia.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|I did some research on this broadcast sticky intent permission issue. So this permission gives the app the ability to send messages that can be intercepted and even modified by another malicious application. There are however ways of broadcasting sticky intents so that they cannot be intercepted. Even if that is not done, the result is only that another application can read and modify the information that this app produces. So you have to have another malicious app on your phone for this to be an issue. And if that is the case then why are you worried about this app when you have another malicious app on your phone. Furthermore, exactly what information does a game have that I would worry about other apps having? My scores? This is required by the adobe air framework and you can verify that by a quick search. I suppose we can complain about the horrendous security problems that adobe has. But do you have flash on your phone? The game itself is quite innovative and fun, and I don't see the permissions as a major issue.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|I got Blu ray crazy and did a little shopping on Amazon, a mixture of new and used Bluray. Since Bluray is being advertized as a new material polymer some thing, super hard and scratch poof, then buying a used one should not be a problem. I am diggin this tora (3x)and the Adele concert, I'm shooting for picture and sound quality only, Man Tora (3x) they have done an excellent job in restoring this film. The sound and picture quality is absolutely excellent. Buy it.<br />Just to show off a little ;) I use an SVS PB-12 Subwoofer, the Jap zero's are flying in my room!

B002W7J3SO|1.0|Is this movie exciting? Yes. But if you, like my wife and I, like to watch old Hitchcock movies because they are usually clean and wholesome, this film will very much disappoint you because of one scene. Following such strained script lines that you will want to cringe, which no woman in her right mind would ever utter, the primary female character brazenly states lustful intentions for a total stranger, whom she obviously knows is wanted by the police. Next, the two hop in bed together. Though nothing is graphically shown, it is quite obvious what has happened. She does it to seduce him as a spy, and to neatly arrange his death, and he willingly accepts like a dumb animal being led to the slaughter.  He narrowly escapes death as a result, bringing to my mind the words of wise old King Solomon:<br /><br />\\"Do not lust in your heart after her beauty<br />or let her captivate you with her eyes,<br />for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread,<br />and the adulteress preys upon your very life.<br />Can a man scoop fire into his lap<br />without his clothes being burned?<br />Can a man walk on hot coals<br />without his feet being scorched?\\"<br /><br />Perhaps that embarrassing scene was an effort on the part of Hitchcock to appear as  part of the trendy new sexual revolution. I am glad that most of his films are not like that! 4 points for an otherwise exciting and well crafted film. Three points off for the unrealistic dialogue of that very strained scene, which for us, ruined what would have otherwise been a good movie.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|So, I just bought this DVD yesterday after I had heard so much about it. I am a big Phantom of the Opera fan, so I just decided to give it a try. As soon as it was over, there was just one word in my head: WOW!<br /><br />I had long preferred the 2004 film adaptation before I saw this, but now I think this is my new favorite adaptation. In short, it is pretty much the whole show being played at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate its 25th anniversary. There were a few modifications (for the better) to the set and production designs that added a more dramatic and realistic effect to the show, i.e., a digital screen used for elaborate backgrounds and a few special effects. So, here is a list of my pros and a few cons to the DVD.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />1. The cast! I don't think you could ask for a better cast. Ramin Karimloo (Phantom) and Sierra Boggess (Christine) have an incredible chemistry together that's impossible to describe. (If you saw or heard the soundtrack to the original London \\"Love Never Dies\\", you'd know what I'm talking about) Karimloo creates a perfect, unique blend of the traditional \\"choir-boy\\" voice of the Phantom and a bit of a modern rock-and-roll personality to the character. In other words, he is a mix of Michael Crawford and a bit of Gerard Butler from the movie. His \\"Music of the Night\\" was unlike any other version of the song I've ever heard. He controls his emotions incredibly well (he knows when to sound more sad and dismayed, and more angry when appropirate) Sierra Boggess plays Christine ten times better than Sarah Brightman could ever have done. She possesses the voice that's perfect for a character like her, and her acting makes Christine a very naive, innocent rising opera star, something that Sarah Brightman lacked during her tenure as Christine.<br /><br />2. The sets: The sets were fantastic. Picture the typical sets and designs for the normal New York and London productions. Now picture a more elaborate, modern, realistic version of those sets. I think the biggest example of this is the roof of the opera house at the end of Act I. In the normal productions, you only see the dome in the roof of the building in the background and a starlit backdrop. In this one, they use a digital screen to create more realistic backgrounds. So, during the rooftop scene, you see a full background of the roof of the opera house, complete with statues and gargoyles, a view of Paris beyond the house, and even a moonlit sky. They even went through the trouble to put together a staged audience just for the show. You can see extras filling the box seats, and there is even a miniature audience revealed behind the stage at the end of \\"Think of Me.\\"<br /><br />3. The more modernized, improved theme: I think the best example here would be \\"Masquerade\\" in the beginning of the second act. Because this is such a big production, there are at least 100 other cast members than the typical everyday production. Therefore, they were able to fill the stage during the masquerade scene with living, breathing actors and not with mannequins. Also, the Phantom's Red Death costume looks like a slightly new and different design, as does his original outfit and mask. I also like how they altered some of the music to sound more like the music and score from the movie, especially the title song. The title song is a bit more of a rock piece than the traditional song from the beginning. (Listen to the title song on the 25th anniversary soundtrack and the original cast recording and you'll see what I mean). The overture also sounds more of a rock piece than is traditional. Let's not forget that they actually showed the Phantom killing Buquet here instead of just showing flashes of the Phantom's silhouette behind the curtain during that part of the show<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />1. Raoul and the managers: Seriously, Raoul was one of the few characters I didn't enjoy that much. Raoul is supposed to be a handsome, charming aristocractic gentleman, and yet just as innocent and naive as Christine. In this show, Raoul is those things in some parts, but in most of the show, Hadley Fraser plays him like an arrogant, pompous jerk. Take the \\"Notes\\" scene, for example. In that entire scene, he has a \\"bow down and tremble before me\\" attitude, which really got on my nerves. Also, instead of seeming sympathetic and understanding at Christine's descriptions of the horrors of the Phantom on the rooftop scene (right before \\"All I Ask of You\\"), he seems impatient and inattentive, with a \\"please, give me a break\\" attitude. So, Raoul was one of the characters that could have been improved. And the managers needed work, too. All in all, I found the managers just plain annoying. They were just way too sarcastic and over-dramatic most of the time, and they said or shouted their lines a lot more than sang them when appropriate.<br /><br />2. The chandelier: I think this is one everyone had a problem about. The chandelier look amazing, much better and bigger than the chandelier from the original show. They altered it to fit the mood of the Royal Albert Hall. That being the case, instead of crashing it at the end of the first act, it just sparks and explodes in places for a few seconds. And then, in the \\"masquerade\\" scene, the Phantom sings, \\"remember, there are worse things than a shattered chandelier\\", even though the chandelier never crashed, so that line seems completely irrelevant in this show. That was one thing I was disappointed with.<br /><br />3. The grand finale: Let's face it, the grand finale was redundant and a bit over-the-top and cheesy. It was nice that they introduced ALW himself, members of the original London cast and team, including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford to pay homage to the show. But having the Five Phantoms and Brightman singing the title song and \\"Music of the Night\\", along with the rest of the cast (old and new) and creative team was WAY too corny and redundant. Bottom line, if they really wanted to put the finale in this DVD, they should have separated it from the actual presentation and put it in the special features instead. The presentation itself should have ended with the curtain call.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a fantastic DVD and a superlative performance. Couldn't have been happier with the casting, set designs, and the overall tribute to the production. The broadcast shooting was beyond incredible as well. You never would have guessed that this was a professionally-filmed stage production; you would think this is an actual movie instead. If you're afraid that this is going to be shot like a home camera movie, where you can only see what the shooter sees from the audience seating, you're wrong. This entire show will blow you out of the water! This is a must buy!
1451627289|4.0|I enjoy King and I enjoy history so this was an easy winner for me.  Long story but I was never bored.  So If JFK had lived, we would be living post apocalypse?  That was a little tough for me.  Still was a fun ride similar to Tom Gordon  in King minus the horror.
B006ON41FC|4.0|ive had a ton of fun with this game, just wish there where more maps. Besides that its completely worth the money!
0307352145|5.0|Quiet is full of a lot of 'aha!' moments for me.  The information in this book gives sanction to many of my lifestyle choices by sharing a wealth of understanding as to why I am 'quiet' or 'sensitive'.  Or why I grow tired in extended social situations. And that, by being aware of these issues, I can deal with them in positive ways.
B006MQRLSA|1.0|I have never seen such a disjointed movie. Brad does, moody, angry, vengeful. There is, however, never any rationale as to why he, for instance, is disconnected from the players or other members of what is, presumably, management, why he throws furniture across the room, why he nearly drives off the highway, what happened when or after he turned around from going who-knows-where-to-do-who-knows-what. I saw an interview is which he stated that everyone thought the book couldn't be turned into a viable Hollywood script; everyone was right. His acting is good, though much of the same old Brad, so I guess I can see the actors being nominated, but the movie itself was so bad it shouldn't have ever been on even a long list of possibles.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire . Its really fun , with simple but challenging games . You earn coins to unlock games which adds to the challenge . So yeah (:

B003MC5N28|5.0|Although this book is a kids' book, I found it very engaging. If you're looking for a great story without the time commitment of a thick novel, then this book would be a great pick. I was still thinking about the ending weeks after i'd finished it!

B005I4JG80|5.0|After feeling really down in the dumps about parenting my one year old I have to say reading this book really helped me snap out of it.  This book probably saved me quite a bit of time/money on the therapy that I thought I needed just by making me (a north american mom) aware of what is possible in terms of parenting peacefully.  I came away from reading this book feeling ready to give my little girl some space to form some independence and realizing that something that would really make me happy is having a life of my own again.  And I don't have to feel guilty about that!<br /><br />I absolutely loved all the tips and personal stories peppered throughout the book, and reading all these made me realize that what was stressing me out is reading all about the rules and methods for getting your kid to do xyz (sleep, stop throwing stuff, etc) when what I really wanted to know is what some people actually do.  Just knowing that this whole country of mommies isn't trying to be perfect super mom took a huge load of guilt and stress off my shoulders and liberated me to think about what it is that *I* actually want right now.<br /><br />Bottom line, I loved this book and feel a lot better about parenting after having read it! (A very quick read too, which was nice)

B0002KPHXS|3.0|My wife and I watched the DVD. I found the sharpness of the images excellent. The sound track is very good. My wife found that Ingrid Bergman was not really pretty and too large compared to the other cast. She found that Bergman overacted a lot. She also found that Howard was too passive, as in his other films. Overall she found the pace too slow and the story too predictable. I agree somewhat. I believe this film is meant to make us consider what life is all about, and whether we should risk a home for adventure. In this sense there is little action. The acting of the secondary leads was better than the two leading actors. By and large the film is good, but perhaps too much is taken from the Swedish plot. In later films, Bergman's acting improved a great deal--I suspect she was too much into the European style, and adapted with time. Overall good but not great. In an historical perspective a very very good example of transplanted stars and story.
0756405890|5.0|I am always searching for a book that can keep my rapt attention for the duration of the adventure.<br /><br />This is one of those books.  The plot twists are great, and the character Kvothe is so beautifully constructed, I was sad to see the book end.<br /><br />To read this book is to be the hero, so excited to read the sequel!<br /><br />Without a doubt, Rothfuss has been added to my list of authors for whom I will read every book ever penned by his hand.

B0078N2MTE|1.0|This is the worst movie, I have seen in 10 years. 'Got Milk' used to hold that place on my scale.<br /><br />Everything moved so slow, and in the end you feel like you wasted your time. There wasn't a twist ending.<br /><br />The guy's 'storm shelter' was a shipping container. Even if there was a natural disaster, that would have been his tomb. What a joke.<br /><br /> I couldn't even stand watching the whole thing, I had to fast forward every few minutes.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|Did not know what to expect. Know I did not want to go to theater to see this movie but DVD? Why not. In retrospect, no idea what I would include in a film on a man who lived so long and was so very powerful. Think Eastwood's method of switching back and forth from the beginnings and then endings was good. So much could have been included that was not. And on Hoover's personal side, I think Eastman did a fair treatment. If you interested in American history, this will give you some and I think worth a viewing. Recommend.

0470638842|4.0|When I received a copy of Socialnomics to review, I asked myself: \\"What can I say about a book that probably has more reviews than bottles of wines by GaryVee?\\"<br /><br />However, Qualman's book is roughly two years old - which is an eternity in our industry - so maybe this is a perfect opportunity to see if it's message still holds true. I quickly found that it does since the concept of \\"social commerce\\" is both trendy and entering the mainstream.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />With Socialnomics, Qualman takes the reader by the hand and introduces them to the business benefits of harnessing social media and speaks to them in simple and easy to understand terms.<br /><br />The book itself is a great resource for professionals either new to or currently struggling with the marriage of social media and traditional business. The first eight chapters are well structured and conclude with a summary of key takeaways. The author then ends his work with two priceless chapters: one that profiles trusted industry leaders and the other which offers additional insight and concrete examples of ROI.<br /><br />The Meh:<br /><br />Qualman's argument for embracing social media to maximize your business is effective and well thought out - however, the same can be found in earlier more groundbreaking works (ex. The Cluetrain Manifesto, Groundswell, etc.). In fact, I would argue Christopher Locke's Internet Apocalypso (Chapter One, The Cluetrain Manifesto) is a much more eye-opening presentation of the reality we currently find ourselves in terms of the power of connectivity as opposed to the same argument made in Chapter One of Socialnomics.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author offers the concept that consumers, not companies, now hold \\"power\\" because of social media. I don't necessarily agree with this. The consumer has always had control both through wallet and word of mouth - it's only now that consumer conversations are able to touch multiple social channels at the same time regardless of distance while offering a seat at the table for companies to listen and engage. If anything, \\"power\\" was and is an illusion and the playing field has been leveled.<br /><br />Lost Opportunities:<br /><br />Although I find Qualman's work a great resource for anyone involved in social enterprise, I find it lacking a section devoted to the competitive intelligence benefits of social media. Remember, we now operate in a business environment where 2 days of online research can produce an online competitive assessment, an industry trends analysis and a \\"pulse\\" on consumer brand chatter. This information is incredibly vital to Leadership and would have taken much longer in addition to costing a small fortune 5-10 years ago. I've always thought that this is a benefit that we don't champion enough.<br /><br />In Chapter Two, the author touches on the importance of social media on finding a job and how employees can keep their jobs via \\"preventative behavior\\", but I think he's also missing out on the importance of social media's ability to improve the overall hiring and onboarding of new employees. Remember, the majority of organizations still recruit much like they did 10-20 years ago and this cannot continue for companies who desire to create a Team of \\"A\\" & \\"B\\" players.<br /><br />In the end, I feel Socialnomics is a great book and must read for social novices and social media intermediaries. For more advanced readers, this is a great reinforcement of the business need (not want) for embracing social media.ime regardless of distance while offering a seat at the table for companies to listen and engage.

0061119776|5.0|I bought this paperback book together with several other board books when my baby was 9 months old. She was not interested in this book at all and did not touch it for a long time. She typically fell asleep shortly after a bath and a bottle feed, therefore, I didn't bother to read to her as a bedtime routine. At 14 months old, she would toss and turn for a while before she fell asleep. Now at 15 months, she refuses to go to bed in the evening. That is when I started to read this book to her and it works like a charm. If she is ready for bed, half way through the book, she would yawn and fall to the bed from my arms. With thumb in her mouth, she falls asleep in a minute. Tonight, she cried when I took her to her bedroom, she wanted to play, refusing to go to bed. So I decided to read her this book, twice. Before I finished the second round, she couldn't keep her eyes open. I let her lie down, she didn't even move a bit, fell asleep right away. I don't know exactly how this book works, but it works. Since we don't speak to her in English, I had to translate the poem into our native language. The color of the room is getting darker and darker as the story progresses, that probably play some role in preparing babies for bed. Other factors including: saying goodnight to familiar objects, seeing that everyone is sleeping (the bunny, the cat...), switching from color to white and black...<br /><br />>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br /><br />update, after a while she figured out that we read this book to make her fall sleep and she refuses the book :(

0439023513|5.0|This trilogy deserves all the praise it has gotten, IMHO. I was prepared to be disappointed with the ending, because some people I knew were, but I was more than pleased, and for the same reason many were disappointed. (And I'll try to explain why without any spoilers, but it's impossible to do without some inkling, so stop reading now if you really want to go in knowing nothing.) Collins refuses to give us a cliche happy ending, with Katniss simply living happily ever after with one of her men, and Snow overturned by District 13. For that I thank her, because if she'd done that, this would have simply been Twilight meets 'question authority'. Instead, she dives deeply into the complexities of love, war, the media, and social dissent, and allows nothing to be seen in black and white terms.<br /><br />In terms of love, Katniss's feelings for Gale and Peeta remain complex, and she remains unable to sort them out or express them in any kind of coherent, let alone romantic, way. She is a warrior, not a romantic, and this doesn't change. Although there is a resolution to this triangle, it's not a simple one, and I'm glad, because this series almost lost me in Book 2 with the Twilight-like 'who is my soulmate' thing going on. In the end though, this triangle allowed for a way to breakdown some of those soulmate type stereotypes that get pushed in a lot of YA literature (a lot of adult literature too!) that make it seem like there is just one perfect person for each of us, when we meet them we'll know, and it's all sparkles and roses once you figure out who it is. These three struggle with love, and are all deeply damaged by what they've been through, making any kind of ending a far cry from the standard 'happy ever after' Hollywood conclusion.<br /><br />Politically, it's just as complex, with Katniss unsure of who is using her more, the Capital or the rebels. This allows for an exploration of the nature of power, of what ends (if any) justify the means, and of how cycles of violence become institutionalized over time. There's a nod to [[ASIN:1451673310 Fahrenheit 451]] as well that I appreciated. It's not a wholly satisfying ending from an emotional standpoint, but like the best dystopia sci-fi, that's what makes it so good, because it assures you'll be thinking and talking about it after you are done. My kids are too young for this series, but I'll be happy when they can read it, and we can talk about it together.of violence become institutionalized over time.

006197806X|5.0|I'm incredibly shocked at how much I loved Pandemonium. This is coming from a person who very much disliked Delirium. Book number two completely blows the first one out of the water. This is how a sequel is done!<br /><br />Lena is incredibly strong this time around. She's a little wishy-washy at times, true, but if you compare her character before and after, this Lena is much more relatable. I actually like her. This may also be because I didn't like Alex (Yes, I said it!) and I got to read her character without all the lovesickness.<br />We do have a whole new cast of characters and I'm happy to say I pretty much enjoyed them all. Especially Julian. Julian is the son of the founder of the DFA or Deliria-Free America. (You can imagine the trouble Lena gets into with him, seeing as she's in the resistance.) His character surprised me. Seeing as how I didn't like Alex, I was sure I wasn't going to like Julian. But no, I really, really, like him. He's like a cute puppy that has been kicked. You can't help but want to cuddle him and make sure nothing bad ever happens to him again. I wish I could say more about him, but almost everything involving his character would be spoiling you on what's to come.<br /><br />I did find the chapters to be a tad confusing. They switch between \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" telling about the Lena now and the Lena that was surviving in the Wilds. It does make the flow information weird. As long as you read the chapter headings you shouldn't get too confused. All in all, I wasn't too fond of the chapters being set up like that. I would almost say that the \\"Then\\" chapters weren't needed. Sure, a few things needed to be explained, but the \\"Now\\" chapters were so much more interesting!<br /><br />I found the curse words to be a little misplaced. They popped up randomly and I pretty much cringed every time I saw one. Not that there are lots of them, in fact there are very few, but they are so out of place that it throws you off what you were reading about. Many times I stopped and thought, \\"Was this really needed?\\" Being that the book is mostly tame (very tame, I should say) having these curse words appear just didn't mesh.<br /><br />The story was awesome and kept me at the edge of my seat. There's a lot of survival battles and death compared to the previous book- which is a good thing.<br /><br />We do get a major cliffhanger. By major, I mean wet your pants major, CPR major, and allover, oh no she didn't major. Do not, I repeat, do not flip to the last page unless you wish to be spoiled. I made that mistake and felt like beating my head against the wall.<br /><br />Now, if only Requiem wasn't a year away...Many times I stopped and thought, \\"Was this really needed?\\" Being that the book is mostly tame (very tame, I should say) having these curse words appear just didn't mesh.<br /><br />The story was awesome and kept me at the edge of my seat.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is an great calendar app, and is the \\"killer app\\" for me for the Kindle Fire.  I considered purchasing a Kindle Fire for quite some time (I already owned a Kindle Keyboard), but the lack of the Android calendar system put me off.  I then discovered this app, which can use the Android calendar system or sync directly with Google Calendar.  I purchased this app and tried it out on my Android phone.  I found it to be just as functional -- if not more so -- than the app I was using.  It helped me decide to buy the Kindle Fire, and I have been very pleased.  Being able to view and update my calendar when not at home is critical, and the Fire's large screen is much more pleasant to use than my phone's tiny screen.<br /><br />Synchronizing directly with Google has an added benefit.  The Android system calendar \\"drops\\" past events after a certain time, so using your old calendar entries to help remember something may be impossible.  Calengoo (at least when synchronizing directly with Google) allows the user to configure the time frame from which to keep entries.  I keep all of mine and my Kindle Fire has no trouble handling the 10+ years of calendar data.<br /><br />If you have a Kindle Fire and need a calendar app, this is a \\"must have\\" item.  Even if you have a phone that already has calendar options, this app is well worth considering.

0143038419|1.0|I started off with the wrong expectation. I expected more of a travelogue, like Alice Steinbach (LOVE Without Reservations!). Instead I was overwhelmed by the constant whiny tone of the book. I tried so hard to give her the benefit of doubt but the author was so self- absorbed and it showed the entire book long. That she can write is no doubt. Her narration can is witty, and her thoughts very well constructed and clearly conveyed. But what she had to say, I didn't enjoy. There was no depth, no conclusion. What's the point of her book? It felt more like reading a diary written with the maturity of a teenage girl. I am baffled it was so highly reviewed.

145162445X|4.0|I cannot help but think that Krauss came up with this title to provoke a reaction in religious people.  As materialists, we often hear that \\"something cannot come from nothing\\" which merely sidesteps the question of where physical reality came from, by positing a divine being of some sort who willed it into existence.  The word \\"nothing\\" is also subject to debate; even in hard vacuum, quantum physics maintains that virtual particles are continually popping in and out of existence.  So \\"nothing\\" in that sense is \\"something;\\" one could say that nothing is \\"nothing\\" because there is always something there.  We cannot conceive of a proto-universe that had no matter or empty space in it.<br /><br />When asked what the universe is expanding into, Krauss responds that it is expanding into nothing, that is, it isn't expanding into anything.  He gives the example of a balloon, in a universe where nothing exists except the balloon.  So if the balloon is blown up, it expands, but not into anything.  This doesn't help since we can't conceive of a universe limited to a balloon.  On \\"Astronomy Cast,\\" Dr. Pamela Gay was asked this same question, and gave a much better answer that the three-dimensional universe is expanding into a surrounding four-dimensional space.  Since we are limited to three dimensions, all we can experience directly is the expanding universe that we are part of, while the surrounding four-dimensional space is a mathematical construct.<br /><br />But if it came from \\"nothing,\\" what gave rise to all the structure and organization?  Dennis Prager, host of the radio show \\"Religion on the Line,\\" used to point out that if we found a technological object, like a computer, sitting by itself in the desert, we would infer that someone designed and built it, and left it there, not that it came into being on its own.  The problem with this thinking is that it leads to the question of where the designer came from.  In the case of a computer, it was designed by an engineer and built by a technician, both of whom, presumably, had parents, were born, and went to school to learn how to make computers.  Proposing that the universe was created by a supernatural diety leads to the same question.  The universe's design must have existed in the mind of this diety before he created it; where did that idea come from?  This explanation leads to the contradictory conclusion that the idea of the universe, that preceded the reality, came from \\"nothing.\\"<br /><br />Yet structure and order appear to exist.  If they did not arise from \\"nothing,\\" or from a diety whose idea for the universe came from \\"nothing,\\" then where did they come from?  R. Buckminster Fuller may have provided the answer in \\"Synergetics.\\"  Fuller observed that the minimum three-dimensional structure is the tetrahedron.  No simpler structure is possible (a two-dimensional shape, like a triangle or square, cannot be an independent structure, only a surface of another structure).  Fuller goes on to explore every conceivable aspect of the tetrahedron.  It is a fundamental property of existence - if a minimum of four points are required, and the only three-dimensional form they can have is the tetrahedron, we may have stumbled onto something.  In other words, matter and energy have no choice but to organize themselves the way they have.  Fuller shows how the cube, as a set of eight points (the vertices), is unstable and will collapse into a tetrahedron.  This may dictate how matter and energy arrange themselves into the most efficient and stable patterns.  No self-taught diety or \\"something from nothing\\" is required.<br /><br />Leopold Bloom \\"how am I not myself?\\"and built by a technician, both of whom, presumably, had parents, were born, and went to school to learn how to make computers.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is a very interesting version of Mahjong. I usually get bored after playing a couple of rounds of Mahjong against the computer, but didn't run into that problem with this version. The story line is interesting, and it keeps you wanting to play just one more level, to see what happens next.<br /><br />It's also fun to figure out how to score extra points, and how to earn the tokens. You can vary the designs on the tiles and in the backgrounds, which keeps the game from getting too repetitive. The music is very calming and soothing, but you are able to turn the volume all the way down if you want to focus on building your speed.<br /><br />I played this version on the airplane, and it made the miles fly.

I am looking forward to seeing this group in person as soon as they come near my area.  I feel uplifted and truly entertained every time I look at this DVD and listen to their beautiful performances and song renditions.  It is with profound pleasure that I rate this group as one of the best female vocal groups in the world!  David Downes, their conductor, is magnificent in his leadership of this group.  He presents them in a most favorable light and shows off their vocal skills magnificently.  What joy I derive every time I see and hear this group sing.  I recommend this group to anyone who truly enjoys great singing and beautiful Irish songs.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing plus the fact that the movie comes out on march 23 2012!!!!!!!!!!!! It is dramatic, mysterious and an action movie all wrapped in one!!!!!!!!! Its great! Try it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It gives a lot of opportunities for points so that you can buy new games. I play when I'm bored which is a lot of the time.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|Obviously been bumped up in the star ratings, not that good, not bad either. just very slow going, you'll nor finish iT very quickly pun intended.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is okay if you don't want to get too in depth. each game gives you about 30 sec to 1 minute to complete. its fun for a quick pick up here or there.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but Suzanne Collins is brilliant! I read the entire book, almost 400 pages, in two days and that was with having to work and do school work. I couldn't put this book down. If your looking for one great book this year, this is it. Only thing is, your going to be so hooked your going to have to read book two and three.
140053271X|1.0|I bought this Nook Simple Touch on Amazon.com, but when I received it, the WiFi would not connect. I tried my home network as well as several WiFi hot spots around town. Barnes & Noble Customer Service was NO HELP, telling me that, since I did not purchase the Nook Simple Touch from B&N, they could not help me, and suggesting that I needed to return it to the seller. I did return it, thinking it was damaged somehow, and the seller graciously gave me a full refund with no argument (kudos to him and Amazon!).<br /><br />Later, I bought one from B&N, and it had the same problem. Again, B&N Customer Service was NO HELP, but did send a replacement. The replacement has the SAME PROBLEM and will NOT CONNECT to WiFi. Now, I'm arguing with B&N for a full refund.<br /><br />Most of the reviews are glowing. But what they don't say is that B&N has this WiFi connectivity problem very commonly with the Nook Simple Touch. Even the B&N Forum has many references to the problem.<br /><br />I'm not saying that you should not buy one of these Nook Simple Touches, and maybe you will not have the same problem. Just beware.<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR!
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is an all around good game. Better than average &quot;running&quot; game, however performs choppy on my HTC EVO, but runs great on HTC Thunderbolt...
B006ON41FC|3.0|people!! there is an option to opt out of OpenFeint. stop rating this game 1 star just because you arr illiterate and don't know how to read directions. sigh. anyway. fun game. can get tedious sometimes but overall, it's okay.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This was a great second book in the trilogy. For awhile I didn't think it was as good as the first, Maze Runner, but then it picked up and I enjoyed it more. Looking forward to moving on to The Death Cure!!
B006FE83V8|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />In April 2012 Universal Studios is 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given re-launches across the year as well - each featuring distinctive \\"100th Anniversary\\" card-wrap packaging and in many cases a host of new features. Most (not all) of these re-issues will be two-disc sets containing the Blu Ray, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download.<br /><br />1962's \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and an absolute peach it is too.<br /><br />Released 10 January 2012 - it comes in a gorgeous limited edition 'book pack' (Barcode 5050582881844). The outer hardback holder has a card-pouch wrapped around it at the base and a 45-page booklet contained within. The book has interviews with Veronique Peck (his wife of 40 plus years), Harper Lee (author of the 1960 novel), pictures of the Shooting Script, Original Storyboards, Original Posters and Lobby Cards (from around the world), Press Book Excerpts and even Correspondence surrounding the movie (telegrams of congratulations from Fred Astaire, Betty Bacall and Charlton Heston). It's a visual feast with loads of photos peppering the wonderful memorabilia. Universal are to be praised for this because it absolutely looks the part. But the real fireworks comes in the other two elements at play here - the extensive extras - and the glorious new print...<br /><br />Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are BEAUTIFUL. Even from the opening logo and credits of a child drawing - there are no lines or scratches of any kind - and the black and white cinematography of 1930's Alabama is fantastically clear. Stand-out clarity - the scene where the accused black man Tom Robertson is sweating in the courtroom as he relays his side of the story (a superlative Brock Peters - he read the Eulogy at Peck's funeral in 2003 at Peck's request), Atticus's son Jem is in his dad's car outside the family home of the black Robertson family as the hateful Bob Ewell looks on, the three children watching from the bushes as the mob try to take the jail with Atticus guarding the doorway, Atticus explaining what happened to Tom Robertson after the trial as the moonlight shines on his suit, the young girl Scout pointing out the simpleton Boo Radley behind the bedroom door (Robert Duvall's stunning cinematic debut where he doesn't utter a word but leaves an indelible mark) - it's all suddenly gorgeous. And the sound is rounded and clean too. An exemplary job.<br /><br />The extras are equally superb - the centrepiece of which is a near one and half-hour documentary called \\"A Conversation With...\\" It's a feast for Peck fans - interviews with Barry Norman in 1974, Terry Wogan in 1979 and other notables throughout the years are peppered with home movies and footage of Peck giving a one-on-one show to a Virginia audience in 1999. It's a raconteur tour-de-force a la David Niven - an 83-year old Peck is generous, charming, witty, responsive - full of anecdotes about Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren and Harper Lee. We get stories about meeting his wife in Paris just before shooting for \\"Roman Holiday\\" began - there's footage of dinner with the President of France Jacques Chirac and his family - a visit to Niagara Falls with his daughter Cecilia (handshakes with an adoring public) - US President Bill Clinton giving Peck the National Medal Of Arts and dropping it! But most of all as the minutes pass by you 'get' why Gregory Peck was greeted with such staggering affection everywhere he went in the world - he literally exuded 'good guy' from his every pore - that old style Hollywood class - a talented giant who didn'thave a mean bone in his body. It's joyful stuff to watch.<br /><br />The movie itself has entered into folklore - released in 1962 and filmed in Black and White - it primarily centres on a black man accused of raping a white woman and the trial that follows. Such was the power of the story - and especially Peck's central performance as the principled lawyer Atticus Finch (his only Oscar win) it literally inspired members of the public to take up the law as a profession and even impacted on America's turbulent and changing racial landscape of the time. The performances by the children as innocents are particularly superb too - but it's Peck who dominates the whole thing with a gravitas and sincerity that few actors could match. His stand against bigotry is magnificent and filled with a quiet decency that has touched audiences for decades. As if sensing the importance of the part, Peck's scrawl is all over the shooting script - to the point that it often obliterates the text - the four words he scribbled on the last page describing the character he plays title this review - and describe the great man himself.<br /><br />To sum up - with the 1930 anti-war masterpiece \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\" also being amongst the first vanguard of these 'restored' releases - it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of its movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I for one will collect the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.<br /><br />An absolutely first-class release - and then some.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />EXTRAS:<br />1. \\"Fearful Symmetry\\" - A feature-length documentary on the making of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" with cast and crew interviews and a visit to Harper Lee's home town<br />2. \\"A Conversation with Gregory Peck\\" - an intimate feature-length documentary on one of the most beloved actors in film history with interviews, film clips home movies and more<br />3. \\"Academy Awards Best Actor Acceptance Speech\\"<br />4. \\"American Film Institute Life Achievement Award\\" - Gregory Peck's memorable remarks upon receiving the AFI Life Achievement Award.<br />5. \\"Excerpt From Tribute To Gregory Peck\\" - Cecilia Peck's heart-warming farewell to her father given at the Academy in celebration of his life<br />6. \\"Scout Remembers\\" - Actress Mary Badham shares her experiences working with Gregory Peck<br />7. \\"Theatrical Trailer\\" - Original Theatrical Trailer of the film<br />8. \\"Feature Commentary\\" - with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula<br />9. \\"100 Years Of Universal: Restoring The Classics\\" - An in-depth look at the intricate process of preserving the studio's film legacy<br />10.

B005URRCUY|5.0|I've heard The Black Keys before. But, this is first album I bought. The album had a sticker PLAY LOUD. I've been playing this album at least two hours a day for the last two weeks. That is how much I love this album. Now, I'm going to buy prior Black Keys releases. The first song, LONELY BOY, plays on VH1. I like the last song, MIND ERASER, almost as much. My dollars were well spent, on this album.
B006C45MRE|4.0|This an exciting and entertaining movie well acted and with and unpredictable plot. It ain't Shakespeare but it's good and fun.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Dosent load on my kindle fire I left it on my bed for an hour and it still wont load
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Foster the People is such a fun and upbeat band to listen to. I can see how some people compare them to MGMT, singing in falsetto so often. Most of the songs on this (their first studio) album are solid and catchy, but the stand out tracks are \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", \\"Helena Beat\\", and \\"Don't Stop\\". Especially \\"Don't Stop\\". I find myself singing along to that song's chorus at the office whenever it's on (Don't stop, don't stop giving me things). They love to whistle. I don't know how they managed to make whistling such a fun part of two songs on this album.<br /><br />\\"Helena Beat\\" is really uptempo and permanently on my gym playlist. The vocal stylings on some their other tracks are less memorable and even a bit boring, like \\"Houdini\\", but made up for by spirited instrumentation towards the end of the songs and strange sounds that I find pleasing, fresh, and interesting. \\"Miss You\\" is hauntingly melancholic and also has an energetic and manic jam at the end. The more I listen to it, the more I'm mesmerized by it. Other tracks like \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\" and \\"Waste\\" aren't very memorable except for their chorus. The not-so-great tracks in my opinion are \\"Warrant\\" and \\"Call It What You Want\\".<br /><br />I would love to see these guys live, but unfortunately, they are coming to my neck of the woods until May and then both shows are sold out.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|just to let you know people...... this game can go suck a giraffes butt;) kk!!! just keeping you guys up to date on REALITY....... if you don't know what that means then tu need to see a therapist. K Cool.... oh before I forget if I cold rate this no stars I would be so happy to guys!.!.!.!
B0058ZPNOK|5.0|This is one of those rare indi type films that is hard to categorise, except in being able to say it is ruddy excellent. It is about a young boy T.J. (Devin Brochu), who has lost his mother in a fatal car crash His father Paul (Rain Wilson of `Super' fame) is wallowing in prescription drug dependency as a way to by pass the grief. They are living with his Grandma and life is slowly unravelling.<br /><br />After T.J. smashes a window of a house where Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is crashing, their paths become entwined. Hesher follows him in the best stalker style and decides he will just move in. The first thing he does is strip off and do his laundry followed by making an illegal cable hook up so they can get more TV channels - especially of the more adult variety.<br /><br />T.J. is dealing with ghosts and bullies in equal measure and that leads to a chance meeting with supermarket cashier Nicole (Natalie Portman). T.J. bonds with her but Hesher is never too far away. He has an unhealthy like for profanity, porn, Metallica and arson; an ideal house guest you might say. Therfore not the sort of friend a young boy should really be associated with. What happens though is that the more mayhem he creates the more he breaks the catharsis of grief that is holding every body back.<br /><br />This film does not stick to any convention, it is totally unpredictable and that is the essence of Hesher himself. There are no real pretty actors everything is seemingly low rent but with real people and it is so refreshing for that. Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues to take on challenging roles and make interesting and well crafted cinema and is one of those actors who can be relied upon to make viewing, anything he is in, worthwhile. That said every single performance is to the high end of excellent especially Devin Brochu as T.J.<br /><br />Directed and co - written by Spencer Susser in his debut for a major picture, who has struck cinematic gold for this off the wall, funny, rude, moving and brilliant film. It has not had a very wide distribution so I am hoping that it will do well in the DVD sales as we need more of this type of film and not less. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommend to anyone who like the more `odd ball' film, for mainstream film addicts this may not be your thing, but I would urge to give it a go- moving funny and excellent.moving and brilliant film.

B0063GORYU|5.0|liked this for easy play but challenging.  great way to kill time or while watching Tv. especially good as it is free
B000JK8OYU|5.0|A Romp...an audio confection...a real treat on a full range stereo system...audiophiles will love this...finally, a creative use of audio sampling...Wow!...a show-and-a-half!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I struggled initially with the present tense voice, but a few chapters in, it became easier.<br /><br />Once the games began, I was hooked. I do feel the editing on the book could have been better. I found some incomplete sentences and some sentences that were missing a word, but over all the characters are compelling. Very good play on the romance. That's what really hooked me. Still, I think it's too violence for 6th grade (which I heard is on a six grade reading list in some schools).<br /><br />Overall, it's worth spending the time to get into the book and I'm excited to start book two.
0060873027|1.0|If they had played this for laughs, it may have been bearable. As it is, if the uni-dimensional nature of the micro-dimensional characters and the dimensionless writing were not bad enough, the drop-dead-dumb plot went from potentially interesting to stupefyingly stupid in record time. So, suppose we suspend our disbelief at the technology at the core of the story. How do we suspend disbelief at the idea that some untold number of employees VOLUNTEERED to let the company use this technology ON THEMSELVES? Even more amazing, this is supposed to have occurred with NO LEAKS. Nope. They all volunteered just for the money. But, nobody told anybody, in spite of how much MORE money they could have made by selling the secret. Uh huh.<br /><br />I must admit I read only half the book. The plot is so ridiculous that it seems ridiculous to get into specifics, but I cannot resist two simple ones. So, the \\"bots\\" at the beginning ... were they people or machines? Did / how did they get back to the HQ after slicing the 3 people downtown? How big were their knives supposed to be that they could slice into arteries? How small were they supposed to be that nobody felt them crawling on their bodies? If they were people, would they really stay on the man's body with no way to get back to HQ? Is any of this nonsense ever discussed?<br /><br />Second, how do you FUEL a micro-plane? The entire plane itself is the size of a drop of fuel. How do you get the fuel in? And, WHERE do you shrink it? And, how much do these planes cost before you shrink them? Are million-dollar planes DISPOSABLE?<br /><br />I've never been a Crichton fan-bot. Now I remember why
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's nice to be able to listen as well as read with this app. The different versions of the Bible are nice, as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This game helps a lot with church and learning about God and what he did for people. You should get this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it makes the time fly when waiting anywhere. there are a few games that can get frustrating. worth the memory.
0375703764|5.0|Every now and then you might read something that makes you question reality. HoL is one of the books that did this for me.<br />It's definitely one of the more creepy books I have read. The layout of the book also gave it a rather unique touch. You really have to flip through a physical copy to see what I mean. Words all over some of the pages, sometimes in circles, sometimes diagonally, with what is basically two books running at the same time; the full body, and another parallel story in the footnotes.<br /><br />What would you do if you came home on day and suddenly noticed.. your house is literally bigger on the inside than on the outside? Only by, say, a quarter of an inch.. but how do you explain it? How do you explain the growling sound coming from the door to the hallway in the dining room? Shouldn't that have been a closet? Why does it seem to go on forever? A sudden addition to the house, a door between rooms, that was not there when you moved in?<br /><br />It's definitely a strange book. It is my opinion that the author did an extraordinary job with it. It has some humorous moments that I would not dream of spoiling for you. I definitely recommend this book if you like things like, say, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or John Dies At the End. This is much more horror than those two could ever be (Not that Hitchhiker's tries, though it is hilarious and odd), you may very well like HoL, as long as you don't mind the fact that it occasionally makes no sense at all, and you might have to turn the book upside down to read it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I whole heartily recommend this fast paced reading with the Grisham's unique touch. My friends have stated that once a person reads one of his novels the rest of his writings hold no surprises. I tell them they are skimming and missing the details that make Grisham's writings fresh and exciting with each new book. The Litigators is no exception. Surprises with each character and when a reader thinks s/he has figured out the outcomes, that is when Grisham's characters becomes the best read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good on the L G optimus, even better on my brand new kindle fire. I really love this game. yippee
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Wow, can't understand why Martin would go off tangent so far in this book.  While the first three books did  jump around a lot through the main characters, you could always find some interwoven thread binding it all together.  However, in book 4 we are painstakingly introduced to detailed chapters and brand new stories of groups of peoples; the most prevalent are the King of the Isles people, never really even explained all the well except through minor references in book 3.  Absolutely no way this group of people should be given such a prominent role in the series, it's like they just sprang out of nowhere.  They introduce a complete new storyline to the series, when there was already more than enough storyline diversity going on already.  Thus leading to the biggest negative issue with this edition in my opinion; which is the complete lack of any mention - or continued story line - of Tyrion.  How could Martin - after making him so central a character as he progressed through book 3 - completely end his story line and barely so much as mention him in book 4???  Then, in some perverse switch, he amplifies and concentrates on a truly pathetic minor character, Brienne? and gives her a MAJOR part in the book???  I'm not even going to say what happens in the end to her, for anyone still foolish enough to read this book; but let's just say she ends up being a complete distraction to the fine foundation of character stories already established in first three books.  And just one more rant...really??? so much time and words spent on Ayra Stark??? She better become the Queen in the \\"final\\" book 5, because her running around escaping this and that was just flat out boring about 1/2 way through.  As I am still pissed how Martin just wrote off the Rob Stark story line in book 3, how he can now concentrate on the younger sisters is beyond me.  At least Sansa's storline was okay.<br /><br />The only positive I will give this book is the Queen's Cersei's storyline.  Martin continues to weave a wonderfully deceptive story for her that is the only thing that carries this book.<br /><br />Do youselves a HUGE favor, just bypass this one after book 3 and wait until book 5 is released for >$9.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure Martin can be counted on to bring everything together for a grand finale or not.  I will review it and let you all know sometime in the future.nues to weave a wonderfully deceptive story for her that is the only thing that carries this book.<br /><br />Do youselves a HUGE favor, just bypass this one after book 3 and wait until book 5 is released for >$9.

B004UJN1XA|5.0|This is an amazing movie. I have never laughed so hard whilst watching a movie. It's a perfect example of why the British make fantastically funny films so successfully.
0670022705|5.0|This book is great because it allows you to place yourself in the historical narrative. This book details the evolution of humanity in such a way that the reader sees themselves as being a thread connecting with the narrative. You feel like you are a part of this wonderful historical journey by reading this book. This book is written by an erudite scholar who has clearly studied the British Museum collection thoroughly for years. The author has wonderful insights into what it means to be human. I especially enjoyed the chapter on early cities and states. I never put it together that a lot of successful tv series center around a certain city, because the city defines the narrative of human interactions. I also enjoyed the insight that social networking sights are so successful because the average number of friends on Facebook, 350, is the average number that early civilizations had to deal with on a daily basis. Our brains evolved to process only a few hundred people in our \\"in-group\\" and our brains are not adapted to process the billions of people who currently live in the world. This helped me feel a connection to the objects in the book. I really enjoyed that the pieces featured are from a multitude of important and obscure religions, cultures and civilizations. This book really fills in some gaps about the mystery of humankind. Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It is useful for so much! I love being able to bookmark and use so many different versions!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I love subtle, moody films! Drive is rather noirish, extremely violent, very sexy and totally stylish. It is like a beautiful, full bodied red, rich & well rounded. There is nothing shallow in this piece and all characters are perfect not to mention the photography and script which is lean but not a word is cliched or wasted. Every now and then you watch a movie which stays with you for days afterwards and this is one of those.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|In brief... (using for PC headphones)<br />... the headphone sound is bad (you hear background sound like someone is tuning a 1940's radio in the background)<br />the mic gain is too low even on the highest settings, (noone can hear me)<br />lots of feedback, cross-noise, echoing,(probably because I got the thing turned up)<br />and frankly the cord always becomes a big gangly mess, it's terrible.<br /><br />free is too much, I'd give them away but then feel bad that someone would waste their time with them (and become as frustrated as I am with them)<br /><br />Never again Turtle Beach...

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have to admit I am not this book's target audience.  As a thirtysomething man, I'm pretty far from this book's target audience.  In fact I wouldn't have bought this except it was on sale and with the movie coming out and whatnot I decided to see what the hubbub was all about.  I was more than a little surprised to find it engrossing enough that I decided to forsake going to bed tonight to finish the last 15%.  I can't remember the last time that happened.<br /><br />The story itself isn't all that new.  There's been natural disasters and wars and a fascist regime has taken over what used to be North America but is now called Panem.  There are 12 \\"districts\\" that each supply the Capitol (formerly Denver) with goods and materials.  While people in the Capitol live high off the hog, possessing technology that sometimes rivals \\"Star Trek,\\" the people of the districts live in practically the Middle Ages.<br /><br />In District 12 is a girl named Katniss Everdeen.  After her father died, Katniss took over raising her family--her mother and her younger sister Primrose (Prim).  The situation reminded me a lot of \\"Winter's Bone\\" and like the elder daughter in that book/movie, Katniss is the one who puts food on the table by hunting and foraging with her friend Gale.<br /><br />Then along come the moment of the Hunger Games.  Each year there's a sort of gladiatorial fight between a boy and girl taken from each district.  The 24 \\"tributes\\" fight to the death and the last one standing lives a life of comfort, which reminded me of Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk.\\"  When Prim is picked to go, Katniss volunteers herself instead.  (I don't consider that as a spoiler since it's in commercials for the movie...)  Katniss and a boy named Peeta are shipped off to the Capitol where they are eventually herded into \\"the arena,\\" a landscape that if not artificially created is at least artificially controlled.<br /><br />From there it's basically like the TV show \\"Survivor\\" mixed with Stephen King's \\"The Running Man\\" where the tributes are all trying to survive the elements while also trying to kill each other.  As a skilled hunter Katniss has an edge in that, but she's reluctant to kill human beings.<br /><br />Anyway, unlike the over 5000 5-star reviewers I'm not going to gush about how amazing the book is.  It's not really.  The writing is plain and there were at least four errors I highlighted on my Kindle.  It's certainly not Hemingway or Faulkner or Proust but then again the book's audience has probably never heard of any of those gentlemen.<br /><br />So really taking the book at what it is, it is an exciting story of survival and romance.  The romance is a little blah but then I'm a bitter old man (at least to the target audience) so what do I know?  Once the Games begin, it's hard not to get drawn into Katniss's struggle to survive.<br /><br />One of the things that annoys me though is that she gets a lot of help in this.  It reminded me of Perseus (the guy in \\"Clash of the Titans\\" for all you kids), who was given all this stuff by the gods:  a magic sword, a shield, a helmet, a Pegasus.  For Katniss it was more down-to-earth things like medicine and food, but still there was always someone to bail her out.  It devalues her struggle a little when she has to rely on the kindness of strangers.<br /><br />Also Katniss seemed a little dense at times, especially regarding Peeta.  I suppose you could chalk it up to her lifestyle in District 12, but really it was pretty obvious what was going on with Peeta.  Why was she the last one to see it?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm not sure what the sequels are about and I don't really care.  Maybe they explain why that pin the mayor's daughter gave her was so important?  I thought it must be some talisman for certain rebellious elements, but nothing really happens with it in this book.<br /><br />Still, even for this bitter old man it wasn't a bad read.<br /><br />That is all.n King's \\"The Running Man\\" where the tributes are all trying to survive the elements while also trying to kill each other.

B00280LYIC|5.0|If you like greek mythology, you will absolutly ADORE this book. Rick Riordan does a fantastic job bringing greek mythology to modern day life. Its filled with adventure, fun, and excitment. This book kept me flipping the pages. Next thing I knew, I was on the next book, then the next one, then before I knew it I finished the ENTIRE series! This is probably my favorite book, like ever! I &#60;3 Rick Riordan!!! Thank you for taking the time to look at my review dear reader.<br />-watermellonsmiles :D
B005FITIF0|5.0|Based on a true story, the movie opens with a brutal genocidal attack on a village, one where a child is being forced at gunpoint to smash his mother's head...but before that happens we flashback 2 weeks earlier. Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is getting out of prison. He was quick sex with his wife (Michelle Monaghan) in the car before they make it home to the trailer park. He is upset that his wife is now packing mushrooms and has stopped stripping, but not as upset as I was.<br /><br />Within 5 minutes, Sam reaches a point in his life where he will either die, go back to jail, or find the Jesus he dreads. He opts for the lesser of 3 evils and goes to church with his wife. He finds Jesus, a bar of soap, shampoo, and a shirt with sleeves. When Jesus sends a tornado through central Pa., it created a construction business for Sam, however the only way he can stop chasing the rabbit is to save his buddy. The next thing you know, he is off to Africa.<br /><br />Combining his Christian belief and bad boy past (which, believe it or not the movie downplayed) Sam decides he can help in Sudan and save part of it by building an orphanage (target) in a war zone. He discovers things are not that easy, even with God on your side. Sam becomes obsessed with Sudan to the point it effects his home life. The scenes have low level intensity.<br /><br />This is an excellent film. It is well acted with mediocre editing. This is not a \\"come to Jesus\\" film, but the story can not be told without showing that aspect of Sam's life. Indeed, at one point the violence causes Sam to question his faith. The closing credits shows actual film of Sam and his family.<br /><br />F-bombs, brief car sex, no nudity.

0375836675|2.0|I was kind of annoyed that during a bank robbery the characters kept joking but then I could understand that it wasn't \\"a real robbery\\". Anyway, The book was interesting at the beginning when he was following his first card but then I lost interested because I realized that every card was a different story. So mainly is like a book of short stories without really saying so.<br /><br />I also hate the fact that the promiscuous girl gets the nice boy at the end. What does it tell people? Really?<br /><br />Anyway, I totally loved \\"the book thief\\" which is completely different. I do not recommend this book and I give it 2 stars because... well, it takes some effort to write a book!

0312641893|5.0|I've heard amazing things about Cinder, and I was SO happy when I won a copy, that I started reading it as soon as I got it in the mail. I was not disappointed, either! The writing was flawless, the characters were well developed, and the pacing was perfect!<br /><br />Cinder was a character that you felt connected with right away. Even though she is a cyborg, you could understand how she felt and how hard her life was. I love the fact that Cinder is a modern take on Cinderella, and that she was the poor girl who tried so hard just to get by in a life full of hardship and rejection. She was the adopted daughter/ward of a vicious woman who resented having to take care of a cyborg after her husband died soon after taking Cinder on. Cinder has two \\"step-sisters\\", the kind Peony, who she is very close to, and Peony's older sister, Pearl, who takes her cues from her mother, Adri. Cinder is a mechanic in New Beijing and dreams of running away one day to start a new life somewhere else. Then she meets Prince Kai, who is an absolute dreamboat, take it from me! He's handsome, charming, and doesn't care that Cinder is a poor mechanic, although she manages to hide the fact that she's a cyborg from him! When the plague hits too close to home, everything changes, and Cinder's life is thrown into even more chaos than before.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book and can definitely highly recommend it!!
B005KP7EK4|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Came in hesitant, but liked what other reviewers said, and also really like Sam Shepherd. Acting was great, scenery - absolutely wonderful, story line very well developed. Would agree that this is a slow moving adventure - gives time to connect with the characters and countryside.<br /><br />Only con, should be rated R for language.

0312641893|5.0|I've just discovered that there are four total books planned for this series---and I have one thing to say about that: Yippee!! :D What a fantastic way to start the new year. This is the first book I read of the amazing lineup of 2012 releases, and I could not have loved it more.  I do love a good fairy tale retelling, and Cinder was absolutely no exception. The basic bones of the classic Cinderella story are there, but Marissa Meyer refashioned it into a completely unique, highly imaginative tale of it's own.<br /><br />The world of Cinder was incredible: a futuristic, overhauled China with little cultural touches of China's \\"past\\", like the peasant's marketplace and the towering tiered pavilions of the palace. An uncontrollable plague has everyone living in constant fear. Cyborgs are being used as guinea pigs to test cures, and very rarely making it out alive. An absolutely malicious queen who rules the colonized moon threatens war if she doesn't get what she wants from the earth's leaders...and in the middle of it all is Cinder. I loved this character. She's living under the harsh thumb of her stepmother who uses her as a slave and blames her for the death of her late husband. She is a cyborg, with more of her body than even she knows made of metal and machinery. She's been dealt a pretty hard hand, but through it all she stays determined to find her way out and into a new life with her best friend, a droid named Iko (one of my favorite characters!) and her kind stepsister Peony. Of course, it's never that easy or there would be no story!<br /><br />The story immediately pulled me in, the characters were at once intriguing and compelled me to either love or despise them, but to also want to know as much as I could about them. Prince Kai was absolutely swoon-worthy and unpretentious. I loved that he and Cinder seemed to easily fall into a friendship, someone they each felt comfortable confiding in. The pacing, I thought, flowed beautifully in all aspects of the plot---the romance, the politics, the race to find a cure for the plague, all held my attention with a death grip to the very end. It was hopeful and heartbreaking, romantic and terrifying all at once. One of the major twists was something I suspected all along, but completely relished watching as the secret unfolded. And that ending!! While it was a breath-taking cliffhanger, it ended this installment at the perfect spot and left me craving book two.<br /><br />Definitely not a debut to be missed, people!!ot---the romance, the politics, the race to find a cure for the plague, all held my attention with a death grip to the very end.

B0069UP2PI|5.0|Watch this movie and you'll never think about doorknobs, shaking hands, or hugging people the same way again.  I thought the pacing of this was perfect and nice to see so many familiar actors' faces in both major and minor roles.  I was most impressed with the work of Kate Winslet and Jude Law.  I also adored seeing Jennifer Ehle again in a role that is night-and-day different from Elisabeth Bennet.  All in all, a good flick and highly recommended if you enjoy end of the world movies.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|As a big fan of time travel stories, and also fascinated by the Kennedy assasination, I found this to be a fantastic story, combining history and fiction. It was worth the 1000 pages.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie left me completely impressed, proud, humbled at the skill and heart of these warriors.

Besides \\"See this now\\" my other admonition is \\"Stand and honor them\\" when you see the list.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I seldom watch movies as I prefer to read books. I wanted to watch Midnight in Paris because it was a love story and I loved the movie trailer. What a Cinderella concept - whisked away at midnight to another time with characters from another time. Loved this movie from start to finish.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|While it may be true that the viewer seems to side with Gosling's character and feel sympathy for him, the movie is just a waste of time. There really isn't much driving in the movie itself. One minute everything seems to start out like there is actually going to be some sort of captivating storyline and then it just turns out to be a waste of time.

B004X6PRO6|4.0|Is this place on another planet?  Is it Shangrila, but not so nice?  How can a country like North Korea exist on Earth?  The most fascinating thing to me about the book is that I got to take a peak inside.  Yikes! I read a review before getting this book and it referred to the second part of the book as being hard to follow.  But as I read, this seemed perfectly appropriate.  When one is being tortured, deprived, starved, brain-washed, I imagine that one could become pretty incoherent.  It's in the second half of the book that the protagonist goes from being a simple little guy to being a super hero.<br /><br />I wondered how accurate this picture could possibly be, but I read a little bit about the author and discovered that he had not only interviewed North Koreans, but had also traveled in North Korea.<br /><br />And having read this book in January, when I hear that there is now some kind of a deal between the US and North Korea, it makes me wonder how it will look to the Korean people.  It was a good time to have read the book.

To begin with found it bit disturbing putting children into games that fight to the death, but the way it's written it doesn't come across in a horror type movie kind of way.<br />Read it based on reviews by Stephanie Myer & Stephen King and who could argue with such great authors!

B0059XTTW8|1.0|I had my misgivings when I heard that le Carre's<br />\\"tinker, Tailor. . .\\" was being done as a two-hour (or so) feature film. Le Carre's excellence lies to a great extent in his superb detail work in both character and milieu. The original miniseries did as full justice as possible to the book. I doubted that a feature film, no matter how talented and hardworking the participants might be, could properly do the book.  I was correct. I saw the film out of curiosity, and because of the cast and director. I found the film to be fatally over-compressed. Some atmosphere was present, but character went almost totally by the board.  I was left with the feeling that if I had not read the book and seen the TV version, I would have had little idea, really, of what was going on or just who the characters were. (This, it turned out was true for my companion at the theater, who had not read the book.) I must conclude, therefore, that making \\"Tinker, Tailor. . .\\"  as a two-hour (or so) feature film was a very bad idea.
B003L77G10|5.0|Why isn't CBS putting out it's BEST show on Blu-Ray???<br /><br />Seems awfully foolish to me, but,then, they probably want to MILK the DVD sales before issuing it on Blu-Ray....
B004SIP8BG|1.0|Based on the numerous raves here and on Rottentomatoes.com, I eagerly rented the film, expecting greatness. While it earns high marks on use of color, I found the rest of the film derivative and worse. It doesn't hold a candle to Ang Lee's take on the same genre (Crouching tiger...), and Lee's film uses the effects much more in service to the plot, which is more interesting, humanistic and full of richer characters and themes. Hero is presented initially as fantastical, but in the end the viewer is told it's basically historical. Thus the story could and should've been told without all the levitation, which amounts to nonsense if this is historical drama. Essentially the filmmaker is asking us to believe and disbelieve simultaneously and accept the wisdom of the narrative as we are distracted by millions of projectiles and the impossible, heroic defeat of same.<br />The worst aspect of the film, which nearly every reviewer either misses or chooses to overlook is the blatant service the film pays to Chinese imperial dogma. Forget about local indigenous cultures or autonomy. Wise, all-conquering emperor knows best and sees all ends. If only stupid locals could be as wise as emperor, but they are just inconveniently diverse peasants. Thus Jet Li, despite all his sacrifice to reach a close enough audience to execute his assassination chooses to let the emperor continue conquering the world and unify the lands and their aimless, clueless peoples. A hero's funeral is the would-be assassin's reward. More color, pageantry and copious extras as credits roll.<br />This isn't art; it's pure propaganda. The director and actors should be embarrassed to have participated. Made by and for imperial stooges of all ages, it looses 4 stars for its inherent and unabashed evil.

1612130283|1.0|This book is one of the worst pieces of fiction I have ever read.  I feel duped by all of the Grey Trilogy recommendations I've seen and read lately.  Frankly, I'm embarrassed to tell ANYONE I've read this book, not because it's billed as a piece of erotic fiction (it's lukewarm at best), but because it is so poorly written I don't want anyone to know I've read it!!  The repetition is inane- by the fifth page you'll be pulling your hair out at the thought of reading the phrases, \\"oh my,\\" \\" inner goddess,\\" or \\"lip biting\\" even one more time. The voice that this alleged American girl speaks with is clumsy, awkward and BRITISH.  So incorrect and unrealistic it's laughable.  The whole Grey experience Is just outrageously, ridiculously bad.

B000001FTD|1.0|Anthrax should have changed their name after their powerful debut if this was the new direction they were headed.This band's sound changed dramatically, it was astounding. I blame them for helping to weaken true heavy metal. I remember hearing \\"Death from Above\\" from their debut on a metal radio show and being blown away by the power it delivered.I am judging this album because Anthrax let me and other metalheads down with this new direction. Had this been their debut I would not be so critical,however even on its own it still bores me. Good lead guitar playing is  scattered, all mostly Spitz, who had a massive tone and style on Fistful but is restrained on this lp. With this album Anthrax gave away their metal.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I don't want to admit that I liked this book. It is so popular, I didn't want to like it. Reading mostly classics, history, and theology, I guess I'm a snobby reader. But the Hunger Games wins in the fact that it is purely a page-turner. For that reason alone, it garners a four-star rating.<br /><br />The book is barbaric and the plot openly devalues human-life and I still find it disturbing that the main characters were teenagers. The setting was very interesting and the characters were developed fairly well. I am always appreciative when an author avoids overstatement or 'over-description.' What Collins achieved better than any author I've ever read was perfect pacing. At times, my pulse was pacing even at the times where I anticipated the next turn in the plot. At one point, I realized my face was flushed! Something must be said for that! But a book must be judged by more than page-turn-ability.<br /><br />For I think there is something here that's pretty unsettling to me and I have been trying to put a finger on it since I began reading.<br /><br />Though the story took place in a mythical land with futuristic technology and medicine the characters were fully human. They seemed to have normal emotions and were capable of love, grief, fear, and hatred. They were susceptible to hunger and sickness and with the exception of Rue, all had normal abilities. All this resonates with the reader. They were placed in horrific circumstances: they lived under greedy tyrants and were placed in a horrifyingly barbaric fight to-the-death arena devoid of even the faintest rules of war. Hunger was a central theme for this book. During the whole story, the main characters are either starving or gluttonous and willing to do anything to fill their bellies. While many of these circumstances can be imagined, it seemed as if the author was completely out of touch with human nature, leaving an otherwise brilliant plot with an unintentional but discrediting impiety.<br /><br />This eerie mixture of tyranny, love, survival, murder, and other various social issues with teenage characters is a little reckless. In my judgment, the author failed to assign the proper proportion of moral gravity to all the darkness she painted into this book. The author choose amoral over immoral and in doing so seemed to bring a moral relativity that was appropriate neither to the human or the mythical worlds where the story took place. I'm not sure how big or small of a blunder this is, but it is unsettling to me.<br /><br />Additionally, though not necessarily a criticism, this book was completely devoid of any intellectual stimulation at all. Though sufficient, her writing style was bland and her language uninteresting. Perhaps that's why this is classified as teen literature.mixture of tyranny, love, survival, murder, and other various social issues with teenage characters is a little reckless. In my judgment, the author failed to assign the proper proportion of moral gravity to all the darkness she painted into this book. The author choose amoral over immoral and in doing so seemed to bring a moral relativity that was appropriate neither to the human or the mythical worlds where the story took place.

He is a straight up compass to 'true north,' to home/om.<br /><br />Sweet nectar for those who have had temporary awakening(s).<br /><br />\\"The real does not die, the unreal never lived,\\" from the cover, sums it all up, though may appear unintelligible. That which IS has no temporary existance and includes the imagined temporal.<br /><br />If you don't 'get it,' don't latch onto the thought-feeling of discouragement, judgement....<br /><br />Simply take what you can and let the rest germinate. Namaste'

Jacob is your typical (rich) teenage boy, with a love for his grandfather that pushes him to the island for his grandfather. I couldn't put this book down, it kept me flipping through the pages past reasonable hours of the night!
B006UG90RM|1.0|Having been a lifelong Van Halen fan I looked forward to this album for quite some time.  If I could I would return it to Amazon and get my money back.  What trash!  We have better garage bands in our area who actually sing that are better than this product.  I could not be more disappointed in this effort.  The sad thing is I had already purchased tickets to see them in May in KC.  I sure hope they don't try to perform these songs on stage.  What a disaster that will be.  I only want to hear their old stuff.  This album has ruined their reputation.  I wasted my money on this mono-syllabic moronic lyricized excuse called music??  I must be the idiot.  I know there are more fans out there disappointed in this effort.  Better luck next time VH.<br /><br />Billy S  from Missouri
