B004XIZN5M|5.0|Great book.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|have played a couple of the games by this same developer. have enjoyed them both. only recommendation would be in future games to allow the User to magnify the search area as needed. would help greatly and many similar types of games allow this as well.
B0002KQNJU|3.0|You know by the complete title not to expect a serious film in THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS OR: PARDON ME, BUT YOUR TEETH ARE IN MY NECK. I've read that it was during this film that Sharon Tate fell in love with Roman Polanksi and they began a tragically doomed romance.<br />Polanski stars in and directed the film. His boyish looks and innocence give him a charm that betrays events in his later life. I can see why Tate was attracted this quirky man. Tate is stunning in her beauty but again is a film that doesn't give her a chance to show her acting skills. She provides the beauty and the cleavage in a sometimes silly but occasionally humorous film.<br />Noted Profession Abronsius, who bears a strong cartoon-like resemblance to Albert Einstein, and his slow-witted assistant Alfred go to Transylvania to track down vampires. The assorted array of idiots at the inn deny that their town has a vampire problem but soon the Professor and Alfred are on the trail. Alfie Bass as the innkeeper provides a lot of the light-hearted fun in the film as he tries to protect his lovely daughter Sarah (Tate) from the vampires while he pursues another lovely lady in the inn.<br />THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS has it moments of fun but this silly farce really is notable for it being one of the few film roles of Sharon Tate. Seeing Tate and Polanski together brings up the question of What if?<br />Would Sharon Tate have become a major motion picture star or would she have settled down to raise a family. Sadly, we'll never know.<br />Again, this silly film has a few enjoyable moments. It's early in Polanski's career, but it is hard to believe from this film, this director went on to do ROSEMARY'S BABY and CHINATOWN.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is the best game ever I cant stop myself from playing it my battery is full and then when I play this it goes to 0 from me playing it for hours
B005LAIIS0|3.0|When did Liam Neeson become such a bad-aze? Was it [[ASIN:B003CRM6QE Darkman]] perhaps? Maybe he always was, but he's such an under the radar bad-aze, no?<br /><br />The Grey is an action/drama about a pack of roughnecks versus a pack of wolves in the frozen tundra. If you can believe that about 7 or 8 oil riggers survive a pretty violent plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness, and if you can believe that a pack of wolves immediately locates and starts hunting the oil riggers with [[ASIN:B00003CXAT Jurassic Park]] velociraptor cunningness...AND if you can believe that the pack of oil riggers never consider using any of the club-like shrapnel and debris from the crash as weapons against the wolves...then you'll thoroughly enjoy The Grey.<br /><br />Not that I didn't enjoy The Grey as it was rolling across my screen. It's just that in hindsight, it was a little unbelievable that this group of people--complete with the clich&eacute; alpha-male (Neeson), the jerk who won't cooperate with anyone, the nice guy, the father figure, the rational guy, the annoying dummy and a couple of other dudes who right from the start you say, \\"Oh you know he dead\\"--could survive an explosive plane crash and subzero temperatures with blowing wind and snow for even 5 minutes.<br /><br />But all in all, The Grey is worth a rent or cable view and should keep you entertained for the approximate 2 hour run time.
B00076ZZ84|5.0|This cd of Avril's was my very favorite.  The skater boy cd before this was good and lured me into being a fan when I was in my early 20's, and now that I am older I enjoyed her more mature sounds with this album.  However, her next album, The Best Damn Thing started her on a decline towards teeny bopper teenage audiences with the exception of maybe two awesome songs, although I occasionally to still like to listen to that CD.  From the couple of songs from her latest album, Goodbye Lullaby, that I've listened to on YouTube- it seems like her music style has hit rock bottom and only fizzled out to the mindless teeny bopper drivel that plagues the music industry today (except for the song from the Alice in Wonderland movie) and I will not be purchasing that album.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how it reminds you everyday to read the Bible it is one of the best apps I have ever got! The awesome part about it is that it really changes lives everyday!!:):)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I have been waiting and waiting for it to come. And here it is. I love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is very fun but some of the games are too hard. they should b alittle less hard and alittle more easy. overall this game is very fun!!!!!!!  you defenently get this app
B007V2UGPE|1.0|This game seems well done and looks like it could be fun.<br />However, the fools at the developer decided to allow it to spam notifications at you, and there is no way to turn this &quot;feature&quot; off.<br />Uninstalled... what a piece of crap.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so addicting I cant stop playing it!! Everyone in the house loves it!! I recommend this game for everyone.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|Ok, I gave this little unit a good chance to work for me.  I have a wierdo mac pro.  I put the disk in and loaded the program. After struggling with finding the info to delete like they instructed -it didn't work.  I had to  call Mac to help me find the  info to delete.  They were no help.  I called the 1-800 # to Global Sat and they took over my computer to config all that was needed.  After we got the receiver to work I then learned that I had to buy  maps of areas that i planned to travel.  There were a couple of businesses that offered the maps.  The Route Buddy seemed simple to download and use.  They give a demo that looked like cartoons and it showed routes of New Mexico.  You can't play with the mapping yourself.  i wanted to put the laptop in my truck and go for a spin to see how it worked.  Couldn't do that unless you bought it.  I wanted to get Google maps but most of what I read on the Web was bad news and nothing but trouble and they wanted a bunch of $$ for it.  For the most part I read nothing but negative issues on it.  Rather than buy something I couldn't try out first to see if I would like it I ended up sending it back to Amazon who were as usual awesome to work with and no return problems.  I'm am now looking to buy a  Garmin.  8 yrs ago i bought a receiver with maps for $40 and it worked great but the company quit upgrading it and finally quit selling it but it was just as they said-plug and play.  If these businesses would make it simple to use as they tout they certainly would sell more units and I would have one now.  TS
B0086700CM|5.0|it really is addictive if you get addicted to stuff .... be careful I have been slacking on chores for 3 days.... tomarrow after school I must catch up.I told my friend to get it and now we are at a never ending war on who has high score...Really fun to play I have wasted the whole day playing and really need to get back into reality... highly reccomend if you are at the airport or on long trips great time waster....I AM TOO ADDICTED TO STOP!!!!!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are my favorite model of headphones for running.  I've gone through at least six pairs of these over the years and keep buying more. All plastic with no foam to hold sweat.  Loose fit in ear canal allows you to still hear street noise. But still hold securely on head and don't fall off while running.  Sound quality good for the purpose and price. After about 6 months of use and rolling up in my gym bag, I'll get a short in the wires - but at this price not a problem. Glad to find on Amazon since these are now difficult to find in the stores.
B0086700CM|5.0|Coolest game ever.Everybody should down load it I talking bout sexy awesome.I want to give a shout out to my Sect GF Katarina
B0086700CM|5.0|ihave been waiting forever and they finally got it I am so excited.I love this game so much its amazing
B004QL7K8E|3.0|It is an ok movie. The problem I have with it is it is not funny. At least not for me. I just don't get the sense of humor they have in this movie, as well as in Hangover 1 and 2. With all the hype about it you sit down and expect to laugh you butt off but then it tuns out to be Meh. A couple of chuckles.
B0086700CM|5.0|the only problem would be it sometimes freezes while I play. When it does this it causes it not to register my swipe for jumping. Plus it does this when I play music while I play.
0767817478|2.0|This could have been a very good movie. Special effects are very good. Jean Reno is very good in his role. As for the rest...<br />Following the success of Jurassic Park a few years earlier, it seems like this film tried to copy their formula and up the ante by bringing the action from an isolated island to NYC. For me, it didn't work. There were too many \\"dumb\\" moments where the people did things that simply made no sense at all - such as the following the sub attack when the subs didn't even bother to confirm the results of their \\"successful\\" strike. Shouldn't they atleast have looked to find the body and then pump a couple of extra torpedos in to it, just to make sure??? Likewise, should the F14 fighters have circled the area around MSF after their air strike to check for survivors (reptile kind) rather than just turning tail and heading back to base? As for Mathew Brodericks charactor (no fault to the actor, but fault to the writting and the script), through out the film he seems to have a gee whiz isn't this cool attitude rather than any type of normal human fear that anyone else might have. Kind of Ferris Buehlers Big Lizard Adventure. Several times when he's about to be eaten he seems more bemused by the creatures than the slightest bit frightened. Just not normal or believable. Bottom line : the whole was kind of like a ride at Disney World, lots and lots of perceived threats but you know in your heart that nothings going to actually happen to the hero - because, well, because he's the hero.<br />This should have been a good movie but swung and missed too many times.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome! great graphics and keeps you guessing. also a great time waster :) it works great on my kindle fire :)
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I life this type of puzzle. My only disappointment is that when I slide or zoom, occasionally I end up with boxes filled in that I want planning on marking. I'm not sure there is anything effective that can be done about this problem, however given the nature of the puzzles and smart phones.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting 4 ever 4 temple run to come out on the aneroid market. it only took me 2days to unlock the girl and the cop.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version is challenging so you don't get bored.<br />It is fun to play.  A little difficult to see size wise.<br /> I had to use my reading glasses for the games.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|I bought these because several people I know love them.  Unfortunately, after one wearing my feet hurt so bad it took days for them to not hurt.  I think the shoe is too short, and not enough room for big toe.  Additionally, they do not look like they will hold up beyond a few more days of wearing.  I am disappointed that I paid so much for so little.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this app its so addicting and fun. even my kids enjoy this app.  cant put it down! runs great on my kindle fire with no issues.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am addicted to Christian Grey & Anastasia Steele!! This book has  inspired my need to read! When's the next installment scheduled
B0033AX20E|5.0|This is the beginning of DragonForce (minus the demo they did when they were called DragonHeart) and to tell the truth, this is WAY, WAY better than Inhuman Rampage! ZP Theart is very confident in his voice and sounds like this is his billionth time recording when this is really one of his 1st times. Sam and Herman...what can I say that hasn't been said? These two are monster guitar players and as always, are kickin some major hindquarters during the album. This album has a different drummer than the later albums (but at this speed, who can tell the difference?), Didier Almouzni is a very good drummer but this will be his only outing with the 'Force. Dave Mackintosh takes over after this album but both are crazy, but amazing drummers. I personally like Dave better because the fills in later albums are much more intense. Vadim is a boss as usual. He's just one of the best keyboardists around today, with Jordan Rudess, Michael Pinnella, and Jens Johansson. This album is probably my favorite album from these guys so far and I think this is best cover art they've ever had!<br /><br />On to the music!<br /><br />1. \\"Invocation of Apocalyptic Evil\\"- Just an intro to the title track...nothing special.<br /><br />2. \\"Valley of the Damned\\"- A very energetic track! This is perhaps their most epic song (excluding the mighty \\"My Spirit Will Go On\\"). The guitars in this one aren't over the top/too busy like some of their later albums. They have nice riffing and melodies on this one. Props to ZP on this one! I love the way he sings this one and this one is probably the one I like singing along to the most (save for \\"Black Winter Night\\"). Great anthem from these guys!<br /><br />3. \\"Black Fire\\"- Very intense riffing on the intro and the intensity only continues throughout the song. ZP's vocals get more emotional and passionate even with all the speed! This chorus is one of the best ones on this album! I love this song because even though some of their songs might blend together due to their speed, this one has a unique tone and quality to it that makes it identifiable. The breakdown in this one is pretty intense. Very good tune here as well.<br /><br />4. \\"Black Winter Night\\"- One of my all time favorite DragonForce songs! The intro already sounds cool, but the song gets even better! I heard this version of it first an thought it was pretty dang awesome! But I recently looked up the demo version of this one because of Brandon B.'s review. I have to say in terms of this song, I agree that this chorus sucks compared to the demo version! I like this song regardless, but I think it had a MUCH better chorus on the demo version. I also think though that the prechorus would make a much better chorus than either of the two different choruses. The part \\"On the endless seas of madness...\\" would be the best chorus. But oh well...This song is just great no matter how you look at it and it is one of my absolute favorite songs by this band. But for the record, the demo version is better. :p<br /><br />5. \\"Starfire\\"- This has to be their best ballad. I've heard two of their other ballads and well...they became a little too guitar oriented. This one is nice and piano driven with the guitars coming in for some solos here and there, but this one flows better than their later ballads. ZP and Vadim are the stars of this song and they really shine brightly here. The acoustic guitar solos are also very nice. Very, very nice song here, guys!<br /><br />6. \\"Disciples of Babylon\\"- As far as DragonForce goes, this is one of their most unique songs. While you'll probably think is sounds normal at the beginning, the middle where all the solos usually are is what makes this one unique. The metal band fades out and then a beautiful passage with acoustic guitar, piano solo, and drumming comes in instead of the rapid fire solos we normally get. This instrumental sounds more progressive as it moves around into different grooves, has softer parts, the electric guitar eventually comes in, and yeah, this song is just very unique in the solo part and it's more original than the rest of their songs. Great song!<br /><br />7. \\"Revelations\\"- this song is filler. It starts off unique, but it turns into a song that is WAY TOO similar to the title track. filler.<br /><br />8. \\"Evening Star\\"- This song starts off slow with ZP and Vadim. And then Herman and Sam and the crew come in and do some some fast-paced metal stuff. The 1st riff in here sounds like \\"My Spirit Will Go On\\" but on that note, not even close to being as cool as that song! This song is pretty cool during the chorus and a few riffs, but really, it's not an essential song from here. I like it a lot tho.<br /><br />9. \\"Heart of a Dragon\\"- This gets the award for cheesiest song they've done...it's really not that good. I think it's one of the biggest let downs because this album is filled with great things (except Revelations) and this is just BAD. I don't like this one at all.<br /><br />10. \\"Where Dragons Rule\\"- After hearing the previous song with the word \\"Dragon\\" in the name, I thought this would be Cheese fest part 2. Actually, this song is good! I love how it starts with Vadim. I love the piano intro and how it progresses and unfolds into another fast song. This one has a pretty good chorus even if it is about dragons haha. I'm satisfied with this bonus track. This one ends the album right. If the previous track ended it, I'd be unhappy because that'd be a terrible ending to an amazing album, but this one sets it right.<br /><br />Verdict: This is probably the best DragonForce album (If this isn't the best, then I think Sonic Firestorm would be the best. I haven't heard that one yet, but I will). I recommend this to any fan of DragonForce, HammerFall, Stratovarius, and other power metal bands. If you've heard DragonForce before, buy this album. If you haven't heard them before, start here! If you like super fast speed metal, these guys will not disappoint! These guys are someof the most talented musicians out there. I suggest picking up this album before any other one.<br /><br />also: I've heard all of this and \\"Inhuman Rampage\\", about half of \\"The Power Within\\", some of \\"Ultra Beatdown\\" and one song; \\"My Spirit Will Go On\\" from \\"Sonic Firestorm\\".<br /><br />here's my listing:<br />best: \\"Valley of the Damned\\"<br />\\"The Power Within\\"<br />\\"Inhuman Rampage\\"<br />\\"Ultra Beatdown\\"<br /><br />I didn't put \\"Sonic\\" in there because I've only heard one song. But yes, this is my honest opinion so far. This one is their best and I suggest buying this one!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This is such an emotional story.  I loved it so much.  Thank you so much.  I cried in many parts it was so good.  Thank you again.  Denise
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the characters and story.  There are many surprising twists and turns.  It is different enough from the HBO show that I enjoyed reading it as a different perspective on the plot.  Highly recommended!

0345803485|4.0|I just finished the trilogy and I loved it!<br />I have never read an erotic romance before. And from the start i can tell EL James is not a great writer. It is obvious she is British as she makes many british language Faux Pas's which an American like Anastasia Steel or Christian Grey would ever say.<br /><br />I found the story very easy to read and although the sexual descriptions become repetitive in the third book , they were interesting enough for me.<br /><br />I think EL James and i have had exposure to the same pop culture  as in it you will find references to Pretty Woman, Thomas Crown Affair, 9 1/2 week, as well more modern references such as The Twilight trilogy. And i cannot help but feel Christian Bale's American Psycho played a small role in creating Christian Grey.<br />I loved both Ana and Christian. I cried when i was supposed to and i laughed when it was intended.<br />EL James has very limited vocabulary and frankly if a man screamed my name every time he reached climax i would have to slap him into next tuesday, but apart from that i read the trilogy in about 6 days and i am left wanting more.<br /><br />The second book Fifty shades Darker was my favourite and the third my least as in the third book she brings up a twist near the end which i really didn't like.<br /><br />I hope there is another adventure for Christian and Ana and i hope she is writing it as i write this review!
B0086700CM|5.0|you should definatly get it!<br />one of the best games out there. very addictive and fun<br />even tho sometimes a little bit slow

B005JE7WKI|5.0|Tucker and Dale vs Evil, was a great satire using the the stereotypical college kids as the blood thirsty crazed maniacs, while the rednecks were actually the nice ones. Fun all the way, just enough gore to be horrific and funny all the way!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Until 2011, I was a Les Mis newbie until my amazing nephew played Javert in his high school production.  That same year, this version was on pbs during pledge time - I was immersed in Les Mis - and have not been the same since.  Love all the cast - yes, including Nick Jonas who has taken a lot of heat about the whole thing. Once you hear and see Alfie Boe, you too will be hooked!
B00634GHJA|1.0|It does not work. Sadly to finish the review I have to keep typing. I'm not a novice either. To bad; sounded like something special.<br />Glad I spent $1.99. Swell
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run was one of my favorite games. then I played angry birds, I compare the two games. then I liked temple run the most. so i downloaded temple run to my kindle fire. this is a fact temple run is the best game and you so should download this game. actually angry birds and temple run is the same amount of awesome so get both of them
160459201X|5.0|I am on the second reading of this book and started to keep a personal journal in conjunction with this wonderful book. Joseph Murray reveals the inner workings of your conscious & subconscious mind in a way that really helps. A great book, life changer and highly recommended!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|In all honesty this does not deserve any stars. If you are looking to read this book hoping it will be a good literary work, you will be extremely disappointed as it is very poorly written. It's basically written porn, and extremely creepy.<br /><br />This book is basically about some poor virgin who is attracted to some big wig CEO with creepy grey eyes. He gives off weird vibes, friends warn her about him, but he acts attracted to her too so she falls for it. He is what is called a \\"dominant\\" and has a weird creepy sex room. Every move is very cold, calculated, controlled and down right creepy - and she has no say in the matter. She basically lets him take advantage of her and use her, because she obviously does not value her life or her body or sex or marriage at all. This was only in the first few chapters - from what I hear it gets even more disturbing and pornographic as the book goes on.<br /><br />If you have any sense of morals whatsoever, if you respect God's design of sex and marriage, or if you call yourself a Christian, you should do the entire world a favor and skip on reading this book.<br /><br />To sum it up, it is complete TRASH!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love all of the imangi studios apps but this one is the by far the awesomest app in the universe I lug it and so do ALL of my friends and I am popular download asap
B0086700CM|5.0|My brother has been telling me to get this app every time he saw me and they finally came out with the kindle fire edition.  I had no idea how addicting this game would be.  I'ge been playing it constantly for 3 days. Angry Birds and Draw Something have nothing on Temple Run. It is so fun and a must have.
0307730697|5.0|Last week I received a copy of a book called \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm to review. Little did I know when I started this book that by the end of it, I would be moved to emotion like I rarely am. This book is a game changer on so many levels. I honestly won't be able to find the words in this review to express how much I wish people would get a copy and read it for themselves. It is the remarkable story of one man, his story, his struggles, his humility, his family, his addictions and oh, by the way, he was a member of the \\"Green Team\\" on SEAL team six (the same SEAL team that killed Osama Bin Laden). Again, I struggle with words to give this book a full review.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm takes us to the beginning, where it all started for Adam Brown. Early on, you are pulled into his life and his story. Blehm does an incredible job of crafting words in such a way that make you feel like you know Adam too. As you read you feel like you know his entire family. His failures frustrate you. His struggle with addiction saddens you. You feel the weight of pour decisions and repeated struggles to overcome \\"the voice\\" that is addiction. Not until about halfway through the book do we begin to share in his journey to become a Navy SEAL. An entire book could be written on the unbelievable physical and mental challenge involved in making it to the elite team which Adam Brown achieved.<br /><br />My emotions were moved to the point of tears at the end of the book as Adam made the ultimate sacrifice for this country, for you, for me. Because we are pulled into the story, the knock on the door to his wife to inform her felt like you were right there. He was father. He was a husband. He was a man of faith. To best describe it, I'll share what the author wrote in his Afterward:<br /><br />Despite the impact and magnitude of the bin Laden mission, Adam's story stands on its own. Throughout his life he inspired scores of people, and his story has continued to change the lives of many -including mine. He's reminded me to appreciate every moment with my family, to be goofy and not grumpy, to get back up no matter how hard I might get slapped down, to sometimes buy my children a cupcake when I pick up coffee in the morning but to call it a muffin \\"because\\", as Adam would tell Savannah, \\"as long as you call them muffins, they're okay to eat for breakfast.\\" And though I hadn't opened a Bible in more than twenty-five years, his faith encouraged me to question my own questioning about religion.<br /><br />I can't think of a better way to describe this book than that. I too felt these same challenges after reading it. It's fitting that I finished the final words of the book, closed it and spent the afternoon with my daughters doing crafts and played catch with my son. I did so, not out of guilt, but out of honor. I did so in a country where we are free to do whatever we dream and wish to do. I did so with the freedom of a father because the sacrifice of another. Friends, I HIGHLY recommend that you pick up a copy of this book. It will remind you how blessed we are as fathers, as wives, as Americans. Because of the fearless sacrifice of men and women like Adam Brown.<br /><br />I give \\"Fearless\\" a 5 out of 5.
B007OWG3LM|4.0|This album was the result of the band not knowing what to do or where to start, so they basically took their old work, tweaked and twisted a little and then mashed it all together to make an album. It works, but i'm also cutting them some slack because this is one of my favorite bands and i tend to favor them when i critique music. The album, no doubt, has some great songs, with the soothing ambience, stomping drums, and Jonsi's unmistakable vocals, it's an all around good background album. Just to take into consideration, Fjogur piano is very similar to \\"Aevin Endar\\" on Jonsi's We bought a zoo album, and Remnihnutur has some similarities to \\"Med Sud i eyrum\\". Valtari overall was a decent work from Sigur Ros, but not their best. Time is the best remedy for musicians and I think Sigur Ros needs more of it to cook up something really good. As for us, we are just waiting in the wings.

B007C3TVNA|2.0|We Need To Talk About Kevin was one of the most disturbingly fascinating books I've ever read. I finally got to see it on DVD and was left terribly disappointed.<br /><br />To be fair, I don't believe anyone could have done a film version justice. The book told the story entirely from inside Eva's head, and the reader viewed Kevin with the same confusion as she did. We wondered along with her, was Eva a horrible mother? Or was Kevin just \\"born bad\\"? Each incident could be viewed from both sides of the equation as Eva turned it over in her mind, struggling to comprehend what led up to the school massacre.<br /><br />We can't get inside Eva's head in a film, and can only witness her interactions with her son as outsiders. The complexity of their relationship is lost. We see Kevin as a bratty child and a sullen teenager, but honestly not all that different from a lot of other kids. It's therefore harder to empathize with Eva, and she comes off as a one-dimensional, resentful woman who didn't want a child and doesn't like the one she got. No wonder Kevin is so cold to her, and gravitates towards his father! The book showed far more depth to both characters' personalities.<br /><br />The epistolary format of the book was something that could not have been easily translated to the screen, but it was a big part of what made the book so breathtaking, particularly at the end, when we realize why Eva is now estranged from her husband. The portrayal of Franklin, by the way, is one of the few things the film improved on. John C. Reilly made Eva's husband far more likable than the clueless dolt he was in the book, refusing to believe that his darling son could do wrong. I can not say the same for Tilda Swinton as Eva. I'm surprised at the rave reviews she received - I found her completely bland and emotionless.<br /><br />Finally, I was disappointed by the glossing over of the actual massacre in the school gym. Not that I was looking forward to the gore, but Kevin's meticulous,finely-detailed planning of the \\"big event\\" in the book added to the horror and showed us what a twisted soul he really was.<br /><br />The novel was a five star read. It really should have been left alone.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|I'm genuinely shocked by how many poor ratings this movie got! I thought it was absolutely incredible. The acting, scenery, plot....everything was superb. I can't wait to buy it and watch it again. Not gonna lie, I wasn't particularly crazy about how many F words were in it, something like 160 I believe. But other than that, I loved it. And the ending? Awesome. I just don't get why people didn't care for it as much...it's an amazing movie, the end.

B00005JLEU|2.0|We were young and in love with the art and originality in/of 'Princess Mononoke'. That's the excuse I'm giving for paying to see this... film. A huge disappointment for sure, but I've reconciled with our mistake. I'll be sure not to make the same one with the new movie that's set to come out later this year.
0812968255|5.0|Illustrative and instructional in its repetition, but not \\"repetitive\\" at all.  The juxtaposition of ideas illustrates them in new light each time and gives fuller dimension of their application.  Considering the context of the man, the audience of Marcus - himself - is liberating, shameless in its admission of humanity and need of constant reminders about how to live.  A roman emperor thousands of years past, wrestling with still modern problems.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|In a bleak, post-apocalyptic future, what's left of humanity resides in an enormous underground silo. Alas, all is not peaceful within the safety of the silo (of course). While most of the silo's inhabitants go about their lives blissfully accepting of their fate, a few begin to question...<br /><br />Sound familiar? Sure... this book does mirror the premise of several survival stories (and underground survival stories at that) that have come before. But then again, I have yet to see many truly new premises that I've never seen before. That said, this book takes some delightfully creative twists and turns from this basic idea and kept me guessing most of the way through.<br /><br />This novel consists of 5 &#34;books&#34; - although in my opinion only the first is capable of standing on it's own as a compelling short story or novelette (though it's a bit too short to be called that). I do think that this first story is well done - I had actually purchased it before I purchased this collection in order to get deeper into the story. The remaining 4 really should be sections within a larger book. The book explores the mysteries of the silo, its inhabitants and power struggles, and the larger issue of what happened to humanity to bring about this bleak condition. I feared, when I began reading, that the book would become mired in the minutia of silo politics and infighting but, to my relief, it spends more time exploring this &#34;world&#34; and uncovering its many mysteries without getting bogged down like a bad futuristic soap opera. The characters are well written, the story compelling and although you may guess at some of the plot twists before they occur (a favorite game of mine) you probably won't see many of them coming.<br /><br />I did find the romance between two key characters a bit thin and took issue with the logic of the event that starts it all off, but these are relatively small quibbles that don't detract too much from what is a well written, creative and suspenseful story. I'm particularly impressed with the quality of the writing from a relatively unknown and (I believe?) unsigned author. Three cheers for an amateur actually worth reading.robably won't see many of them coming.<br /><br />I did find the romance between two key characters a bit thin and took issue with the logic of the event that starts it all off, but these are relatively small quibbles that don't detract too much from what is a well written, creative and suspenseful story.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman's theory is easy to understand and he gives examples of how this has worked in the past as well as examples of how this was not used in the past.<br />I heard him live in DC recently and although he is a democrat it's too bad for our country7 that he can't get an audience with the President.
B00014X8KO|5.0|I remember seeing these three stories on Encor I believe, and was taken back by the fact after the first two minutes, I forgot it was an anime!  There are three stories, all dealing with the human condition, in one way or another.  I felt this was like, Rod Sterling and Walter Lanzt make a film!  If your viewing this for the first time, forget the label \\"cartoon\\". if thats what you bring with you when you watch this, you will be losing a lot. keep an open mind and be prepared to experience a wonderful evening of anime story telling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first heard about Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games on a flight between Philly and Birmingham last Christmas. A young woman, late twenties early thirties, was reading it and her seatmate asked her about it. One of the best books she ever read, she enthused and went on to talk about the story. I don't usually read popular fiction but I could tell this woman was intelligent and I thought, \\"I'll look into that when my reading list goes down a bit.\\"<br /><br />Kindle had a sale on the first volume shortly after the movie came out and broke box office records. I thought I'd start it and if it was corny or awful, set it aside. It took me about ten days to read all three volumes, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, The Mockingjay. The last time I was this involved in works of fiction was Richard Stark's final three Parker novels, and The Hunger Games blew those out of the water.<br /><br />I suppose it's partly that Katniss Everdeen revives the Diana archtype. The way the character balances courage and ruthlessness, with loyalty and loving kindness made my heart surge repeatedly through all of these volumes. The term \\"modern classic\\" is trite but I'm here to tell you these books will be read by your great grandchildren. I could compare them to 1984 and The Count of Monte Cristo, even Treasure Island, but these are not just rollicking good tales or cautionary warnings. Collins makes her readers consider what is \\"right\\" and what is necessary. Suicide and revenge are recurring themes in these books and no character is exactly what they seem to be. Inconsistencies and weaknesses bring a level of reality to these books rare in science or dystopian fiction. Most novels are either character driven or plot driven. The Hunger Games trilogy is both, a powerful plot inhabited by unforgettable passionate characters. If you haven't read them, I envy you encountering them for the first time. A word to the wise, get all three volumes up front. You will not want to stop until you learn what happens.t happens.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|The Smart Baby Monitor by Withings works great. It sets up easily out of the box and the app installs in a flash. I use the monitor to watch over an elderly parent and the video is clear and the night vision works well too. I use the monitor via Wi-Fi and I  have had no problems.  When using the monitor over a cellular network, it needs to allow longer than thirty minutes of use. Overall I am very pleased with this product.
B003VS0CYC|3.0|The Robocop trilogy on Blu-Ray is pretty much the same as was issued on DVD back in 2005. Other reviewers have complained that Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 have not been digitally remastered in any way. They are correct but forget to mention that even without the picture being remastered the Blu-Ray's still have a picture improvement over the DVD's. Also, the soundtrack to every movie is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. If you have a sound system 5.1 channel or better and a device that supports the Master Audio the upgrade is warranted. While I do feel that its a shame that Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were not remastered I do recommend the set especially to those who have sound systems. I recommend buying this at any price point under $25 and not higher.
B004132I20|5.0|This series of sherlock is brilliant.I highly recommend this series for the wit, mystery, and a great adaptation of the great detective.
B004MME7GA|5.0|This was an excellent buy. The plot, imagery, dialogue and style of Sr Arthur Conan Doyle make it an altogether memorable book. I love the fact that each adventure was concluded in one chapter. Once you have read one you are coaxed into reading another and another until you barely want to put the book down! If you love murder/mystery this is one for you.

B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great game once you play it you become addicted everyone should buy Temple Run!!  when you play you start out as one character then as you gosling and collect more coins you can purchase more items in the store with the coins that you collected like more explorers hoists and power ups and much much more!!!!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|I've had this movie sitting in it's box for a little over a year. I just didn't have the time, or the will to watch it. Surfing on the web one day I found a picture of 2 girls hugging very dramatically in a bathtub and someone mentioned it was from \\"Room in Rome\\" so I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />Picture is marvelous and music is exquisite... I regret enormously not watching this movie before. The story happens in a small room of some sort of hotel in Rome full of paintings. Two strangers meet in a bar, and decide to act crazy for once and head to the hotel room of one of them. Four walls, yet the story does not become boring.<br /><br />This movie dances in a thin lie of truths and lies, and the line becomes even thinner when trying to classify it. I would consider it one of the greatest lesbian drama movies done so far, yet since the two main characters spend 90% of the movie naked it caresses the erotica genre so sensually you will have trouble classifying it yourself.<br /><br />There is just so much complexity, complicity, companionship, and passion between the two characters there's no denial they're each other's true soul mates...  This movie truly catches a glimpse of how lesbian relationships happen many times, and how things are just not always sexual. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This app is well supported, provides deep gameplay, maintains a high level of \\"pick up and play-ability\\", works well on several platforms, and has good music. Couple this with the narrative that this builds as you play and you've got a winner here. If you've ever played Spacetrader/Dark Nova, Dope Wars (or any of its variants), or even Elite, to some degree, you'll feel very much at home in this game. If I had a complaint, its that we don't have the cool icon from the version in the Google shop. Rest assured, though, all of the other features are intact. World class stuff.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|this app is too expensive for what the game is like I mean 3$ coming it should be 0.99 or free
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game I've played in my life its so cool. And if I could I would rate this a 1,000,000,000because this game is awesome royalties best game they should  call it
1933633867|5.0|As you can tell if you are a Kindle reader that 38% thing is meaningful! we don't do pages.<br /><br />Anyway point is I am daily completely excited by this book and can't wait to recommend. And I will obviously post again when I have finished - but in the meantime buy it and start reading.<br /><br />He has taken decades of research and thinking in my skull and shaken it about in a very exciting way. I was not forewarned or fore-enticed that this would be a feminist exposition for example - but if you understand feminism in the same way as I; a consideration and mindfulness of the role of women you will be thrilled. In fact it seems to me in his research he stumbled across women as so essential and so identifying critical ways of thinking - of them and by them he could not ignore them. Through this he has uncovered new insights on dowrys, bride prices, pawning, the veil. Religion in all it's confusion and inter debt can be stripped away to reveal the mechanics where the currency of power is debt. But first an examination of what that means. I have always found money a difficult concept to understand. And gifts and debts and now I know why. And I thank him heartily and am enjoying book so much.

B00881VLCE|3.0|I like the app but the only puzzles that came with it was kittens! the other ones you have to buy
B007P3TMW2|2.0|Sorry, but it sucked. Good actors do eventually get stuck with a script that does not work. I could not even finish the movie it was so boring. But you can find out for yourself cause everyone has an opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so happy temple run is finnaly on the kindle this game is awesome love it and its free
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|The first season is good and look forward to the second. The acting is good and special effects are good. The reason for the 3 stars is that the sex scene and the abundance of blood were totally unnecesary. Many of the scenes can be classified as porn. So be aware this is not for children which is to bad.
B0086700CM|5.0|You get such an intense feeling when the monkeys are behind you. And being able to turn invisable and being able to rush through everything is so great.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked the story - had a great rainy day to read most of the book. Felt that the love story was a bit over the top - but King did do a fair job of weaving it into the story. Same with reading about Marina's legs. I got it the first two times he mentioned they were good looking. That kind of repetitive writing occurred several times and made the book longer than it needed to be.<br /><br />Certainly a better read than Under the Dome...
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I was affraid at first (seeing all the complains about this toy) then I saw a video on youtube on How to Fix it and thanks to that I decided to buy it. I bought to of them., and after all the both where in great shape.<br />I cannot comment about how tough they are because I didnt drop them once.<br /><br />Sorry for my too basic english.
0545265355|5.0|I loved, loved, loved the Hunger Games trilogy.  I got the set because I saw the movie and liked it and knew the books would be even better.  What I didn't expect was to get sucked into the world of Katniss Everdeen and not be able to get back out!  I read all three books in six days.  I just couldn't put them down.  As soon as I finished one I had to start another to learn what happens.  Now I can't wait for the other two movies to come out![[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]]
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I have enjoyed using this app on my iphone and thought it would be just as great on this platform. Unfortunately this app only has a few bibles available for offline reading. The plans don't always update. Once the bugs are worked out this should be an awesome app.
0525478817|5.0|I was intrigued with the review on NPR so I picked this for our book club. My teenage daughter decided to read it as well. Very moving and thoughtful.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I was a bit skeptical hearing a while back that Myles and Slash were making a complete album.  Well, they proved me wrong.  This album does not contain a single track I would consider filler.  Not very many records have been released in recent history that I feel the same about.<br /><br />The singing is some of Myles' most diverse since Fallout, by The Mayfield Four.  All sound the same?  Hardly the case here.  Quite a few different sounds mixed in with that rock-anthem high pitched wailing.  It all fits the style perfectly.  I don't miss that Rose guy for a second.<br /><br />Slash's guitar work on this record is nothing short of amazing.  Brings me back to the Appetite days in high school.  It's fresh and energetic.  The intro to 'Anastasia' really stands out for me.<br /><br />The entire band seems to gel and the record sounds like they have been together for some time.  It just fits.  Same for the production.  Very clean.<br /><br />Highly recommended purchase to any fan of energetic rock and roll music.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|Bought it (Seiko 5) last year (Oct 2011) for my 11-year-old boy as he wanted an analog watch for his birthday.<br /><br />He wore it every single day (and night).  He took it off only when taking shower as I've warned him that the watch is not fully water resistant and that the canvas strap will get wet and stink.<br /><br />Our assessment thus far (after 7 months of ownership):<br /><br />1.  The watch gained roughly 2-3 minutes every other day.  I've shown my son how to adjust time, and he would adjust it every other day 2-3 minutes.  Not so good.  If it's 2-3 minutes a month or even a week, it would be acceptable.  But 2-3 minutes every other day was a pain...<br /><br />2.  The mineral glass scratches very easily.  All glass will scratch.  It's a matter of who wears the watch and how careful he/she is.  Well, my son is very active, and the scratches on the glass prove it (both front AND somehow back side).  I don't think it's necessarily the watch issue, but the user issue.  Just remember, all glass will scratch.  I do wish that the watch design somehow receded the glass.  Rather, the first contact point on the front AND back side is glass.<br /><br />3.  Canvas strap is not quite as nice as one would think.  It was ok new...  but after my son wore it for such a long time (~ 6 months) day and night, it got very dirty.  So you have to wash it every now and then.  Well, the watch is not fully water resistant.  Rather inconvenient--you have to be careful washing the strap.  I'm planning to change the strap (to a silicone or rubber) soon after I get the watch back from the vendor for warranty service (see #4 below).<br /><br />4.  Warranty service.  Well, I can't figure out if it's the watch build quality or my son's active nature.  The rotor weight came off after 6 months of being on my son's wrist.  He was so so sad.  Well, what's a good father to do?  Casio G-Shock Analog-Digital from Amazon.  He is now so so happy.  Just out of curiosity, sent a message through Amazon to the vendor to see if warranty applies.  They told me &#34;yes&#34; and to send the watch to their store.  I did.  They confirmed receipt and told me that they will return after fixing it.  I will update once I get it back.<br /><br />Overall, if you are an adult who takes care of his/her watch, I'd say Seiko 5 automatic is aesthetically good watch.  Nonetheless, the watch (at least the one that I got) gains too many minutes too fast.  Also, the quality is questionable (with the rotor weight coming off, even though it's being fixed under warranty)...  my 20+ year-old swiss-made automatic has never had any issue with the build quality (although it also gains a minute a day).<br /><br />If you want a very reliable analog watch, I'd recommend Casio G-Shock Analog-Digital (too many models to choose from including solar/atomic signal).<br /><br />Good luck!me &#34;yes&#34; and to send the watch to their store.

B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Excellent author.Book keeps you wanting to continue without putting the book down.Started on book five but have since decided to start from book one and read all the books in order.
B007SGM084|1.0|Did not care for the book. I thought it was a romance novel and it went a little bit more at some things I never thought of. I read up to chapter 5 and got to the 6th and I couldn't read any more the language I never use so I just couldn't read any more.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|This is a short book that is essentially a sales pitch for HTML5 and provides a good overview for somebody that is wanting a high level overview of what HTML5 is about, but not detail as to how to do anything. It focuses on the \\"what\\" not the \\"how\\".
B0001I55NS|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Timeline.\\" I'd say it largely failed as a movie, but had a few interesting parts for which it could be commended. The acting was marginal, at best. The photography wasn't bad, however. The story was, well, unbelievable. Let's break it into two parts. First involved the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo of time travel from the present back 600 years via someone's idea of a hokey time-travel machine. Just relax and throw away all your scientific background. Of course, they were having problems with the machine and one problem was they lost the good professor on the last trip back and now had to go on a rescue mission. Yaawwwnnnn!<br /><br />Well, they managed to get back 600 years only on the day of a major battle in the French-English 100-year war. Bad timing. Now we went into the second part of the movie and that was at a castle in Northern France which was about to engage in battle. Here, the costuming and set was actually rather good. The action was brisk and violent. There were a lot of brutal killings, but such killing was with clubs, swords and arrows. Remember, this took place 600 years ago. The main battle scene was actually quite interesting, particularly with the use of long-range ballistics (catapults), the high-tech weapon of the day. The hand to hand fighting was brutal and rather well done. In all this part, the time-travel crew faced a deadline in having to get back, if you believe in that drivel about time travel, and the reliability of their machine was in question because of a previous misuse. Yaawwwnnnn! Let's face it. The movie was a failure with a few well-done parts.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I of course purchased this book after hearing all these women gush about Christian Grey...I don't understand what women are seeing in this man.<br /><br />After trying really hard to get through the book due to the writing (sounds like this might be a 16 year old author who is writing her first book) the story line is definitely a cheesy romantic fantasy. I do not understand why every time the characters speak to each other they have to remind themselves who they are talking to \\"Hello Mrs. Steele\\", \\"How was your day Mr. Grey\\" \\"It was fine Anastasia\\" \\"Oh good, mine was great Christian.\\" WE GET WHO THEY ARE TALKING TO! Also, after the first sex scene the rest seem completely unrealistic as Ana climaxes when he just touches her, Christian slams himself and other things inside her and it makes me laugh at how ridiculous it all is. Ana completely degrades herself and doesn't have a backbone until the last 5 pages of the novel. I really dislike hating the heroine of a story but there is nothing to like about Anastasia Steele and the only thing I like about Christina Grey is he is supposedly gorgeous and extremely wealthy for only being 27 years old.<br /><br />It is a fast easy read and despite the horrible writing it wasn't completely awful. I would recommend it to anyone that can stomach s&m fantasy and can get over how unrealistic the whole story is.<br /><br />I am hoping that the next two books will get better as I hear the story picks up in book two.
0345803485|5.0|I recently read this book while at the beach and I absolutely could not put it down.  As soon as I got home I ordered the other 2.  I loved them all.  Yes, it is total fantasy - but I have 2 small kids and an incurable illness.  I need fantasy.  I have more than enough reality.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Hey, I'm not supposed to like John Mayer! It's not cool! But I gave this a listen, and I must say it's a fine, fine collection. Love the vibe, love the guitars. OK, I'm not always certain what he's singing about, but with all the plastic, disposable, meaningless pre-fab pop dominating the airwaves these days, this record truly shines.

B0086700CM|3.0|Temple Run is a an awesome and fry addictive game.  I would've given it five stars if it hadn't recently started glitching on me.  I was playing and the graphics were working like an old, scratched-up DVD.  If you are going to ge this app, get it on all your other devices and reconsider buying it for your Kindle.  I'm sorry my review had to be negative.  I really love the game.  It's just I don't want others to get up set with it.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I was delighted with this beautiful film. Wanted to watch this movie for a long time being one of the iconic and most stylish of romantic comedies ever. Hepburn is at her best, with a young George Peppard (whom unfortunately didn't see more of him in such roles). Mancini's music is haunting and Edwards direction impeccable - elegance is the first term which comes to mind watching this film - besides the elegant cut in the dresses designed by Givenchy for Hepburn. One should not fail to credit the novel by Capote (of which some changes were done in characters etc.) A work of the golden years of Hollywood films which is now lost to the explicit, ugly, gruesome, un-elegant and pathetic films produced.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very addicting and one of the best games I have ever played. I don't think this game will ever get boring.
B000V698M4|5.0|I must admit, I am a Supertramp fan, and I always have been since \\"Breakfast\\" came out in 1979.. I was about to  turn 14 at the time and that album was a serious turning point in music for me. The mix of instruments in the songs and the lyrics..and the vocals....WHAT VOICES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......WOW!!!!! I have since been adding all things Supertramp to my audio collection.. trying to find EVERYTHING that the band ever did... with or WITHOUT all the \\"key\\" members.. I had purchased the album from 1985, \\"Brother Where You Bound\\"  back in 2000 and never really listened to it as it just did not click with me as the classic \\"tramp\\" sound but BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!! Going through my CD's the other night, I came across the \\"Brother\\" CD and put it in the player.... OMG!!!!! What a FOOL I was back in the day for not really listening to it! The two tracks that just captivated that \\"REDISCOVERED\\" moment for me are \\"Better Days\\" and MOSTLY!! THE AWESOME \\"No Inbetween\\"........ I HAVE PLAYED THE LATTER SONG MANY....MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST MONTH AND IT STILL STIRRS THE DEEPEST DEPTHS OF MY SOUL!! With Rodger Hodgson missing on this fine album I figured that it would sound a bit lacking in the original quality that only albums with ALL the original members seem to possess BUT!! Rick Davies and the crew pulled off the almost impossible here!!!! ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW! WOW! WOW!<br /><br />My Epilog.... I now own ALL of Supertramp's work, It is all  AWESOME to me but a few songs really stand out and we all have our favorites for one reason or another.. So LISTEN and ENJOY!!<br /><br />\\"At the end of my HECTIC day, the only things that make it all worthwhile for me are \\"My Dogs, Bourbon, Cigars, AND................... THE MUSIC\\"!!!<br /><br />CHEERS TO ALL!!
0765342294|5.0|Wonderful book and very enjoyable to read.  Be warned though once you start it is very difficult to stop! You can't help but to get wrapped up in the characters and world of the author. It might be about children but this is one story that is ageless.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Controls are intuituve, difficulty covers a good range. Some of the pictures were a bit obvious from fairly early on which made them a bit easier than they should have been. But there are quite a few puzzles at each difficulty so the game offers many hours of entertainment.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a complete masterpiece.I love having to run through forever.I know the graphics are a bit sloppy but I don't care and so does anyone else playing this game with a good review.But graphics don't make a game it's gameplay.If you have problem controlling the runner then go to option and set the sensitivity st the right level for you and it will be tightly responsive.I believe that anyone who gets a game on a kindle fire or any of the other devices like an ipad or iphone then this a game worth getting.

0307970299|4.0|A good book and I would recommend it to friends.<br />The voice of the reader was difficult to listen to<br />but I got used to it after a couple of chapters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome to have this wherever I am. only issue is I downloaded the NASB version on a previous phone and am unable to move it to my new phone. Other than that it's great.
0345803485|2.0|It embarrassed me to even read this. It has a page turning quality but it is unrealistic and poorly written with a very boring storyline.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting!!! I remember playing it on my friends iPhone, but sadly, me only having a Kindle aand no iPhone, couldnt get it. And then, it came out on Amazon, and for FREEEEEE!!! :D I was waiting for a very long time. Finally it came.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Really???  A bestseller?  It was not the worst thing I have ever read but certainly did not live up to the hype.  I guess folks who were so shocked by the content have never read erotica fiction before.  There are many more titles out there that do a good job with the genre.  This was not one of them.
B007L96SI6|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. My favorite song is What You Don't Know.  This is real music for mature adults, I doubt the Justin Bieber fans would like this album, because it has lyrics that make sense and a musical style similar to the 60's or 70's, something similar to jazz, funk, hip hop all rolled into one.  I cannot stop listening, and I find myself thinking about the melodies enevn when the Ipod is off.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was purchased for my wife; she tells me the characters were interesting enough,  but the use of language is pretty dire.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG!  I cannot believe this book, Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />I knew that it was a Best Seller, and that's what I like to read, but was not sure about it.  So I decided to order a sample from Amazon to see if I would like the way it was written.  I only read a few paragraphs and immediately, I ordered it through my Kindle.<br /><br />I could not stop reading this first book of the trilogy.  I finished the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey in 7 days. I immediately ordered the second book, Fifty Shades \\"Darker\\" and finished it in 8 days. Upon finishing the second book, I immediately ordered the third and last book, Fifty Shades of Grey \\"Freed\\".  I started it May 30th and I am almost at the end. I loved, loved, loved this book.<br /><br />I cannot believe that this trilogy is E.L. James' first book!!  She's a great writer and I love books that tell you about the characters and when the characters are mentioned again you remember who they are because she lets you know.  I highly recommend all 3 books.  Yesterday, I read the last book in between commercials when I was watching TV.  I plan to finish it today.  Cannot wait to see what happens.
B00881VLCE|3.0|can't get the last 2-3 pieces to move, it looks good, but if you.can't finish the puzzle there's no point...android samsung fascinate
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great! it works with ease on my kindle fire and I have been waiting for this game for so long. I am so glad that it is now available for kindle fire.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Absolutely could not put it down. A story that just grabs you from the first few pages and does not let you think about anything else even days after you finished reading it.<br /><br />The thing that struck me the most about this book were the dialogues between Eva and Gideon - it was so refreshing to have a heroine who was not afraid to speak up her mind, regardless of her feelings for this out-of-this-world man. I just loved how she keeps him on his toes throughout the book, never quite allows him to take her for granted. The love scenes were, needless to say, beyond hot but also necessary to make the reader fully understand the nature of the need that these two characters develop for each other. It is not just carnal, a book like that would not keep you glued to the pages so well, it is purely psychological. Eva and Gideon are both \\"damaged\\" individuals due to very unfortunate pasts. They were both abused as children but they cope with the damage of those experiences quite differently. Eva has been in therapy ever since her mother found out about the abuse and she has dealt with her demons. She has grown into a strong-willed and confident young woman who still admits having low self-esteem issues but I think she's doing quite well considering her past. Gideon, on the other hand, has just swept it all under a rug and uses control in all aspects of his life to deal with his issues. Not having control over Eva is what initially attracts him the most to her, in my opinion. For the first time in his life he has to let his guard down in order to get what he craves the most - Eva's affection and acceptance. She does not judge him, she keeps no secrets from him and tells him exactly what she is thinking at any given moment, never afraid to hurt his feelings with the truth. He has to work to keep her and that is something he has never had to do with another woman. He falls for her deeply and starts opening up. His vulnerability to her is just beautiful to see. He does not accept losing her, ever, cannot see it as an option at all. He's upset when she refers to their relationship as \\"temporary\\" and is not afraid to express the depth of his feelings towards her for the whole world to see. The chemistry between them is undeniable but it is evident that their physical connection is something they both also desperately need to fight their demons and feel safe in each other's arms. They are literally each other's therapy.<br /><br />This is a book that took my heart on such a roller-coaster ride that I had to stop at times to catch my breath. I felt their pain, I felt their anger and I felt the intensity of their love for each other. What more can you ask of a book?<br /><br />Any similarity to Fifty Shades of Grey is truly coincidental. I guess both Christian Grey and Gideon Cross are strong alpha males with heavy emotional baggage and dominant personalities but they deal with their issues somewhat differently and I could not draw too many parallels at all. The female characters have nothing in common with each other. Eva is strong from the start, Ana has to learn to find her voice. It makes me mad when people compare the two stories implying that one inspired the other. They are such different pieces of writing and both beautiful and compelling in their own rights. My only criticism of Bared to You is that I now have to wait until October 2012 to see how this story develops even further. Ms Day, you got yourself another fan.t accept losing her, ever, cannot see it as an option at all.

B0086700CM|5.0|finally they've added this game. Yeah!!!!<br />Its fun and addictive good for long car rides or just lying around. very cool game to play and to challenge your friends scores
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This chapter of the story is exceptional. Martin makes an impossible world believable.<br /><br />I was absorbed by the story, had feelings about the characters and wanted to know more.<br />His technique of leaving the reader hanging in some situations and hungery for the resoltion is both annoying and successful.<br /><br />When approaching the last pages of this chapter a certain sadness developes that the characters will remain static for awhile and no longer be the active, alive companions they were as the story is read.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|This book is a really important tool for learning one of the most difficult English topics -for a Spanish student, at least- : Phrasal Verbs, always so bored and so complicated to remember.<br />It makes them easy and really interesting to review from time to time. At last yo know them without effort.<br />I recommend it to every English student.
B000002KYR|5.0|I bought this to remind me of some good times in Germany in the 80's.  That said I only jam about 4 of the records and 2 other tracks less often.  Great seller who shipped this to me real fast even if it was only standard shipping.  I thought I had reviewed this but I didn't.  I wish I could give this seller &#34;+&#34; to go with the 5:)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wow Mr Bates is so cute , I just love the clothes and the story is wonderful, I have season 1 ans 2 so far , Looking forward to season 3 .
B0086700CM|5.0|out of all the games that can be  downloaded for free this is probably the most usable. practically every part of the game can be done wo using real money unlike others which are only free for the purpose of luring you into paying money
B0085776BG|1.0|I feel this film is doing an injustice and glorfying the wrong airmen.  This film make you believe that they won the war, killed Hitler and defeated the Japanese;  while other troops<br />stayed in the trenches and were to afraid to fight.<br /><br /> This is nothing more than a propaganda film.  Much like<br />Hitler did to the German youths prior to declaring war<br />on his own people.  Don't fall for it.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Great app.  Timely and accurate.  I use the app to monitor the radar for incoming storms.  The localized weather is amazing.  Only glitch is deleting a location I don't want.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the puzzles and the music is so relaxing! great way to unwind... the pictures are awesome! I think this is my favorite app! &lt;3
B004LWZW4M|1.0|I thought this movie was really lame. The original movies were classics. This was beyond weak. I can't  consider James Franco<br />A serious actor he plays a good stoner. Sorry but I did not see any quality in this flick. Even if Caesar said he was home!
B0070Z4LLW|5.0|LOve this Film this is a Great tie in to the The Thing by John Carpenter (which will never be Matched) if you take it as a prequel which it is its a great film. Great effects it rocks
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I listened to this book on audiobook, and it was forever long, and I can truthfully say I enjoyed every single moment of it. The characters were engaging, and the plot was gripping, but what I truly enjoyed about it was the history. I had studied World War I in high school, and it was a complete mystery to me. After finishing this book, I finally felt like I truly understood how this war could have happened, and how truly horrific it had been for the people who lived through it. I am grateful to Ken Follett for opening a door to the past for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh my goodness. So fun and extremely addictive. Don't think my blood pressure appreciates it. So intense. I love it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book for the first time in 2000 or 2001 during my senior year of high school.  I read it in one sitting and bawled the entire time.  I was a wallflower, too, and while I had good friends, I never experienced the sex/drugs/parties/whatever of being a teenager.  I read it a second time a couple years into undergrad and did the same thing - read it in one sitting and cried all through it.  This is an amazing book - up until I was 20 or 21, I made all my friends read it, and they all loved it as well.  Now that a movie is coming out (directed by the author, so I have hope for it), I wonder if I should read it again. I just need to stock up on tissues.
B0086700CM|5.0|AWESOME!!!! GREATEST GAME EVER PLAY IT EVERY DAY AND IT DOESN'T GET BORING. ONE WORD AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EVERY BODY SHOULD GET THIS AWESOME APP!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is awesome.I love temple run because it has fantastic graphics. I love it.  I love it.  I love it
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the most awesome game if you haven't got it you should and I have saved up all my coins and got a football player witch is cool!!
B0014DQSGW|4.0|Some might consider this fun but mindless entertainment but the movie does manage to avoid many of the usual cliches of light-hearted romantic comedies. Bullock and Grant play well off each other and the snappy dialogue is reminiscent of the best Cary Grant romantic comedies. The days of those great actors and movies might be gone but this movie is the next best thing. Overall, a fine effort by the writer, director, and actors and worth seeing.
B0086700CM|4.0|love the game it rocks. only 4 stars because the sensors don't always work right causing you to drop off.  also does not tell you how to achieve all the objectives which is frustrating.  but all in all it'd a great game to.play.
B0086700CM|5.0|you just want to keep hitting run again!<br />I like the graphics as well.  It's a very fun game to play

B0086700CM|5.0|This App the Trufff Hoeee..! Lol im Kidding.. But im Glad The Kindle Fire Is Now About to Download This App... But Sometimes its Kinda Sloww And has Skips :/ ...
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|the timer really kills this game for me , along with the robot quest , and the match sticks was , fairly enjoyable up to that point , but would not reccomend this game as is
B0086700CM|5.0|it killed time and it was fun I think it was the bomb of all apps +it made being grounded more fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it! It has a great variety of games! With this game you can choose from over 100 games to play and its so fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is soooooooooooooooooo cool I was mad when they didn't have it hut when they got it for kindle I thought I was dreaming.
B004SBX112|5.0|Fun game. Addicting to play. I takes time to get to all levels.Try all the angry bird apps. They are<br />great.
B005LAIGLO|1.0|WOW...I have rarely been so thrown by the horrible quality of a blu ray...not only did they movie suck (bad acting, stupid storyline that's been done to death) but the hi deg quality was a joke...not sure if this was the director's intent but this was about the ugliest presentation I have ever seen...especially for a modern film...the grain was off the charts...every scene looked like it had been shot through sand...and the camera work was so sloppy and shaky that it made me sick...also the film is SO dark that it's hard to tell what the hell is going on from scene to scene...next I popped in a 60 year old film called To Kill and Mockingbird and it looked beautiful...proving to me that some idiot out there WANTED this film to look like this...Don't waste your time...this blu ray is horrible!  I will never watch this again or recommend it to anyone that has REAL film taste...It's sad to me that this is the trite stuff that passes for entertainment...I feel sorry for young people that think this is what a good movie is supposed to be...In case you couldn't tell...I HATED this film...and the quality stinks...ZERO STARS (the only reason I gave it one star is because Amazon forced me to)
B001MTENOC|5.0|An eye opener for life and its meaning. Michael Newton discoveries opens the world awaiting us after death, what wil happen and the continuance of life and the importance of the missions we play on our daily life struggles. A must read book.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This is an amazing movie, really made me a fan of Taylor Kitsch. We want a sequel... blu ray is must-own
B0073PPKNM|5.0|This album seems a little over produced at times, but still has the great sultry voice of Melody and haunting, tranquility that I love so much.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|this is totally worth the money if you have netflix and are tired of waiting for this season to become available.
B0086700CM|5.0|the graphics are good and it is a very addictive game five star for a cool game that is also very tricky and uses time you need to waste.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I haven't made any comparisons with other coolers besides the stock coolers that come from Intel and AMD. So I only know that this cooler is a huge step from them and was worth replacing especially if planning to over clock.<br /><br />I have this installed on a overclocked sandy bridge 2500k @ 4.2 running games at 35 C on a Asrock extreme 4.<br /><br />Was easy to install and it is easy to clean.
0739378333|4.0|The book was exactly as advertised and arrived within a few days of ordering also as advertised.  The price of the book was not much lower than the going price, which was a little disappointing, but it was a little lower.  All in all, I was satisfied with my purchase.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|good book and was well written but I found it to be a bit short for a John Grishan novel. I read it in one session.
0345803507|1.0|I have to give the author credit for writing the three books.  It's not easy taking the time to sit and write that many in a row so quickly.  However, after all the hype...the banning from our local libraries.....the TV chatter, I was disappointed.  The story isn't that good.  The author uses the same words over and over and, along with ridiculous amounts of sex, it all becomes so redundant, it made me yawn. It got to the point where I dreaded reading yet another sexcapade and started skipping over them to get back to the story.
0061743526|4.0|This story points out racism in South America in the 1930s. It is related through the gullible eyes of an 8 year-old girl, Scout, who spends a lot of time with her brother Jem and a friend, exploring the world around them. They spy on their neighbour because they have never seen him outside and keep on imagining he is a ghost. This is the children's world, rather nice and funny.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is another world, more serious. The one of their father, Atticus Finch, a court-appointed lawyer who fights for a black man, unfairly charged with having raped a white girl. Atticus is a really good man; a model of integrity for nowadays' lawyers. That is why, when he get insulted because of the case, Scout can't help asking herself questions and trying to understand what he did wrong.<br /><br />We witness a trial, which implies facing all the social prejudices of the 1930s, narrated by a little child who realises that there is unfairness, good and evil. She is discovering the world, quite simply.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome but it has its ups and downs. sometimes its glitchy but otherwise I would give it 5stars.
B006NXI58M|5.0|Catching Fire is the 2nd book in the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It is well written and the plot is well thought out.  If you enjoyed the Hunger Games, i'd highly recommend this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. great time waster and incredibly addicting. two thumbs up! highly recommend getting it for your kindle fire
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is such a fun game to play! My whole family loves to play! Be warned it does get addicting :)

B0041KKYCY|5.0|I loved it ,loved seeing the woman get the man back and boy did she(you go girl)This movie was way better then the first .Most of the reviews on this movie are  more then likely wrote by men who likes it when the girl gets raped and did not wont the men to get what they gave ,but boy did they.Wayyyyy better then the first .

B0086700CM|4.0|its a little laggy at first but just as good as the version for itunes. it could be better but its decent
B003QSOFFO|2.0|The songs and story line were a dud, not very interesting. Or perhaps it was just the racist language on both sides that distracted me.  \\"Savage\\" \\"White man\\" \\"injun\\" \\"demon.\\" My daughter is only four and so didn't seem to pick up on it, but an elementary-schooler might pick up on some of the language.  And it didn't help that Mel Gibson, who can't sing, is the male lead and is known to have some racist views in real life.  Finally, Disney was unable to keep any deaths off camera and implied and so it was the first Disney movie which she asked what happened to this or that character (who was killed).<br /><br />Pass on this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|Excellent great game a lot of fun. My kid loves playing it and so do I. Works great on my kindle.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I purchased \\"Giving myself\\" to be put on my mp3 and loved it so much that I purchased the cd.  The entire cd is full of beautiful music by Jennifer Hudson.  I listen to the cd and the mp3 music over and over and over again.  Outstanding purchase.  Outstanding music.

B0079R8KXG|4.0|The Mareware case cover is sturdy,folds up easily and props my Kindle up nicely without sliding when I'm lying in bed reading.The plastic clips hold it in place so I don't have to worry about it sliding out of the case. Well worth the money
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't write reviews. I especially don't write bad reviews because anyone who has the guts and talent to write deserves someone more knowledgible than me to review their work. I just had to write at least a short review on this book because it's so bad. I've read better fanfic, lots and lots of better fanfiction and just don't understand the hype about this book. My 13 year old is a better writer although I'd hope she doesn't know enough about erotica to do so. I will be talking to everyone I can to try and understand what any of them enjoyed about this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love tbis app itnis an amazing game...... i hope tthat they come out witb a temple run 2 same as temple run just a bit differentn

1469984202|4.0|After so many enthusiast reviews I feel a little sorry to give only 4 stars to this series. They have an interesting setting and very likable characters. Also, like it or not, it is pretty obvious that the writing is not run-of-the-mill stuff. But I was seriously disappointed by the ending of the closing book. After an infinite detail of the inner feelings of the main characters, we are left only with a brief narrative to explain what happened in silo 18 to change the outcome. I was really happy for Juliette, but felt seriously deceived... This is not fair, man! Anyway, I'll buy book, just in case it gets better...
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I just wish I would have read more reviews on this movie before taking the time to watch it.I understand some feel it's a think piece on how one meets the end, and the wolves are a metaphor for the grim reaper, but even taking that into account the movie fails on so many other levels it left me very disappointed.<br /><br />  It's a insult to think that the cast survives a plane crash in a harsh arctic climate and decides to follow one mans poor decisions. These are supposed to be ruff and tumble oil riggers who work in this environment yet the very basics of survival are lost on them? Shameful writing. About the only upside of the film is the look and feel of it. Even the beautiful scenery can't make up for this movie.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is super simple and very addicting! its a fun game for a car ride. and if u don't believe me this game is even at arcades!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun. It is a game you'll have on the top of you list.  Even though it gets harder the farther you run it will still make your heart race in a good way. :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously?  Its like Barbara Cartland with badly written porn scenes.  Who reads this crap?  Wish I could give it no stars....

B0058S0OMS|4.0|I remember it as vividly as any memory of my youth - I was about 7 years old. I woke up in the middle of the night and went to the kitchen for a glass of water. Instead of drinking it and going directly to bed I sat down with my drink and turned on the TV. It was HBO and a movie was coming on; little did I know it would be Halloween II and that I would remember sitting and watching that movie for the rest of my life. It has been nearly 30 years since that night, but I remember having nightmares about it for weeks after seeing it.<br /><br />Now that Im an adult and have come to appreciate a good scare, I look back on my first encounter with \\"The Shape\\" very fondly. Although it is not a masterpiece of cinema (unlike it's predecessor) and wont be seen on any AFI lists, \\"Halloween II\\" accomplishes what it sets out to do very well - to create an eerie, claustrophobic, scare-a-thon, that leaves its audience gripping the armwrests of their theater seats until the thrilling, climatic conclusion.<br /><br />A short synopsis would be this: Laurie Strode survives her first encounter with Michael Myers and is transported to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital where she must endure one more epic struggle with the immortal serial killer in the dark corridors of the nearly abandoned hospital before her nightmare will finally come to an end.<br /><br />'Halloween II' is not a methodically paced, psychological thriller; as opposed to a true horror film like the original John Carpenter classic - it is, in fact, almost the antithesis to the original with lots of blood and gore, but therein lies the genius of the film. Where the original played to frighten you psychologically by lurking in the darkness, the 2nd film tries to scare the hell out of you with everything up close and personal, and it succeeds brilliantly. A fantastic horror film!

0345803485|1.0|I hated the book, although I only made it through chapter 9, and decided to give myself permission to stop there, and agree with all the other one-star reviews I've been reading; namely,<br />that this book feels like a romance novel that might appeal to a 13 year old, except that it contains boring trite characters, that I wish, would be removed from fiction, rather than perpetuated in<br />cheeky stories like this one.<br /><br />Here's the trite and predictable stuff that hit me in the face....(right out of Pretty Woman).  Male lead is wealthy, businessman...(yeah 27, fluent in French, pilot, and billionaire...).  he has somehow managed to have time to have<br />15 lovers, by the way...who have vanished, apparently, when he grew tired of them, without a whimper.  I don't have to finish the book, to see that Ana will be different.  From the moment she stumbled into this office<br />for the interview (having no idea who she was interviewing, yeah right), I see every bad chick flick playing through my head.  She bites her lip.  She makes him laugh.  She fixes him breakfast (after night of passionate lovemaking<br />that would have sent any other 21 year old virgin to a hospital).  She wears his shirt...she dances in the kitchen, while making his breakfast, and guess what?  Looks up to see him sitting on a stool, watching her...smitten.<br /><br />I finally had to throw the book down when they finish yet another orgasm (back to back these are), and he overhears his MOTHER coming down the hall.  So yes, Ana is about to experience every girl's dream....already meeting Mama.<br /><br />Additionally, I agree with all the other reviewers about the overused adjectives (tenacious has been used to describe Ana's roommate 4 times already)...and metaphors that make no sense.  Writing is abysmal.  Sex scenes are not erotic (to me, and I am no prude)...but I believe all the 5 star readers are only compelled to read this drivel because of the sex and that alone.  Surely they can't think these characters are real.<br /><br />I have to also agree that it is depressing that these books are so popular.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book for reasons already well spelled out by others.  Reading it was several hours I won't get back in my life. Redundancy of word choice, predictable character responses, no character development... For pages on end (well, the entire book!). If you want to know the story, read Twighlight. If you have already read Twighlight and longed for that unhealthy relationship to have BDSM sex, then this book is for you.  I am certainly happy for the author and her found success in these books. However, I will not be reading Darker or Freed.  I recommend reading the in depth reviews which sum up the stories quite nicely.
0679847367|5.0|This book was better than expected! It's a great book for a grad gift for sure! My cousin graduated high school and I got it for her it has a sleeve that covers the whole book it's very adult looking so I say it's good for a kindergarden of high school  graduate.

B007UZO3F6|1.0|First, I've been a big fan of Shuttle systems, the form factor is great.  I'm using a i7 3770 processor, not overclocking, all default bios settings, newest bios, etc.  On install, the \\"Windows Experience Index\\" crashed, just screen bars, no errors, etc.  A second run passed, then it crashed just playing a DVD.  I downloaded AIDA64, and ran the stability test.  Every time I run the stability test with GPU and cache test, for example, or GPU and CPU, the system crashes, needs a full power cycle.<br />The tech support at Shuttle was slow, and gave short remarks like \\"we sold thousands, nobody else had this problem\\".  I am exchanging the box, paying the $20 shipping fee, and having two systems on my credit card until this is resolved.<br />At this point I've wasted about 25 hours on the debug.<br />The mechanical quality is nowhere as good as my 67 model shuttles, the screws don't fit well, the cable dressing is bad.<br />I'll see how the next one works, and review it as well.<br /><br />Update-<br />The second system failed in exactly the same way. I down graded the BIOS to a older rev, and this bug went away, but new ones came up.  The tech support was hopeless.  I returned the second box for a refund, and put the same components on a ASUS mobo.  Perfect operation.<br /><br />I love the shuttle concept and form factor. This would have been my 4th shuttle system, but this box is not ready for sale.  OBTW, graphics cards don't really fit unless you want to do some sheet metal and cable rework.  I tried with an MSI 7870, one of the shuttle recommendations<br /><br />Wait 6 months, maybe they'll get the bugs out.
B003BWERF8|1.0|1st day:<br />this BT dongle is great!  use it with my sennheiser mm400's:  seamless setup ([...]), sounds great, paired with ipod touch and ipod nano in a flash.  highly recommended if you want to dump the wires :)<br /><br />2nd day: stopped working properly.  return to sender (premature elocution on my part).
B0073PPKNM|3.0|I recently discovered her after hearing a song on the radio.  Have 2 of her earlier albums and enjoy them both.  I must say this recording is a bit different.  And glad to see others are also shocked when listening to the 11th track.  11 minutes of dead space and then something not of Melody Gardot.  Very unprofessional production.  But can't blame the artist.  Otherwise enjoying the recording.

B003L77GG0|5.0|5 star rating for the series as a whole. Sure there were ups and down, the worst being the doldrums of the mid-series' Lex and Lana years (such a waste of Rosenbaum) but overall this has been spectacular. I grew up reading Superman comics and watching various TV and film adaptations and as much as I loved Christopher Reeve as Superman I have to say this series is the best take on the mythos - and I just spent the last few months watching Smallville from start to finish. Every show has it's dogs, but when Smallville was firing on all cylinders it was spectacular TV. And since this is the set-up to a boy becoming a man it truly is the journey and not the destination that is important. We all have our quibbles, I would have preferred Zod or Lex being the main villain in the final season, but when you see most of the abysmal dreck churned out on TV these days I'm happy with what we got here. To the critics on Amazon who said, \\"That's it?\\" in regard to the last SHOT of the series, clearly, they didn't get it. Yes, that's IT, and real Superman fans will not only get it, but they'll love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is where it gets very intense this book and mockingjay i couldnt put this book down i just kept reading i love these books i wish they had more of these kind of books if any books are like these one plz write a review i hope yall enjoy the whole seris ( i think i may have spelled somehings wong sorry
0985081821|5.0|I found the plot very interesting. It was fast paced and there were several stories happening throughout. I expected it to be confusing wiith so much going on, but I was pleasantly surprised that I managed to keep up with everything.<br /><br />Initially I wasn't sure whether I would enjoy the \\"vampire\\" element to the book, having read half of the Twilight Saga and not really enjoying it, but the backstory involved with the creatures and characters in The Forever Girl really made it an enjoyable read.<br /><br />There were several twists in the plot that were certainly unexpected, I sometimes found myself shouting at the characters in disbelief.<br /><br />I really loved the characters that Hamilton created. She took your expectations of paranormal characters, turned them on their heads and added a ton of depth. I really liked Sophia, but I initially struggled to like Charles. The character of Ivory was really interesting, as Sophia's friend I thought that she would have a relatively small part in the story, but there was so much more to her character.<br /><br />If I had not known before reading that this was Rebecca Hamilton's debut novel, then I never would have guessed. Her writing is incredible and I found the book so difficult to put down, I would get to the end of the chapter and I'd just want to carry on reading.<br /><br />I've loved reading about witches for years so I really enjoyed that element of the book, but reading The Forever Girl has also awakened a love for all things paranormal and I can't wait to sink my teeth into another paranormal novel and ultimately Rebecca Hamilton's next novel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's twilight without the vampires and with sex...lots and lots of sex. Don't expect a literary masterpiece, but it's somewhat entertaining.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Surrounding the capital city of a nation in ruins, are twelve separate districts that are all over-populated by desperate residents. How do you pacify such angry citizens? Simple: Reality television. No, not Jersey Shore, something much worse. Or better, depending on how you look at it.<br /><br />  Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence of Winter's Bone and X -Men: First Class) is a skilled tracker, hunter, and survivalist who lives in the impoverished District 12 where most earn their living in the mines. Her mother (played by Paula Malcolmson) has been struggling since her husband died, leaving her to raise Katniss and her sister Prim by herself. Katniss (Lawrence) is sixteen and a close friend of Gale Hawthorne (played by Liam Hemsworth) who dreams of running away. Every year, each of the twelve districts randomly selects two children (one boy and one girl) or \\"tributes\\" no younger than 12 and no older than 18 and Gale (Hemsworth) believes he's dodged the bullet as long as he can. Still, when the tributes are selected, Gale is spared and so is Katniss. But when Prim (Katniss's sister) is chosen. Katniss volunteers to take her place. Making her and Peeta Melark, (a baker's son portrayed by Jess Hutcherson of Bridge to Terabithia and Journey to the Center of the Earth) the candidates for the 74th annual, winner-take-all, death match known as The Hunger Games. Held in the Capital, The Hunger Games are broadcast live to the entire nation. Each participant is trained, sponsored, and ranked and then locked in a massive, futuristic Coliseum with remote control hazards, predators, and cameras hidden throughout.<br /><br />  Now, this was a much-anticipated film. I was greatly intrigued by the trailers, but Twilight was also much-anticipated and no matter how much love it gets from the audience, I haven't even been able to sit through the first installment. Then, I saw the generally positive response from critics and took it upon myself to see this highly entertaining, dramatic effort and I urge those out there who haven't seen it to do so at there earliest possible convenience. This is a great film.ning, dramatic effort and I urge those out there who haven't seen it to do so at there earliest possible convenience. This is a great film.

B000HEVALC|5.0|This recording is the result of Sam Phillips having the foresight to recognize a piece of history in the making on December 4, 1956. There are no complete songs, some only snippets and a good bit of talking. It's just a few guys messin' around in the studio really - a few guys who would become musical legends.<br /><br />After reading many of the \\"reviews\\" it absolutely amazes me that some people have no idea, and I mean NO idea whatsoever, what this recording actually is, and even after they listened to it! \\"No music heard...\\", \\"Very poor sound quality\\", \\"...sound is not up to today's standards\\", \\"a rip off\\". One even wrote, \\"I don't think elvis meant this cd to be released.\\" HUH?!?! Pay no attention to these \\"reviews\\". These were made by the likes who would undoubtedly discard a Babe Ruth baseball card because it was bent.<br /><br />If you're looking for a pristine live performance of various songs by these four men, then you should look elsewhere. But if you are looking to be a fly on the wall during a particular historical Tuesday that captures four very young future musical superstars just being themselves and having fun, then buy this disc.
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|Continuing the commercial trend of the previous album,this one I thought would be better but it was far worse than the previous one.I first heard Shinedown when they released \\"Leave a Whisper\\" and I was amazed at how Brent Smith sounded and how the band played,the music and lyrics were top notch.Then \\"Us & Them\\" came out and was even better,much more melodious and lyrics equal or better than the previous album.\\"Sound of Madness\\" was too commercial for my taste as I don't like bands that drift into radio trendiness,then came this album.<br /><br />This one as I stated before is by far their worst album,I understand that bands evolve but did they have to sell out so much as to become to radio friendly.It kicked off with \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"Bully\\" then the album from there on mellowed out and sounded to much Pop than Rock/Metal.They included piano to some songs which for me turned me off to a few songs,the lyrics were not good and the album was released too quickly.I thought they would release something near \\"Us & Them\\" but in reality they released a album which has 5 songs at best that are worth listening.<br /><br />This happens to bands who sell out for Platinum success.Shinedown fell into that hole,they can get out but if it keeps on,Shinedown for me will be a total sell out and a Radio Friendly band with rock songs to be shown & heard in VH1's Top 20 Countdown,in other words NOTHING!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This was purchased as a gift. It arrived on time. I was told this is perfect for the kindle fire. Very pleased.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|Yes, editing has been done but you find me a live album that hasn't been edited that isn't a bootleg.  If you ever heard the original you know how much it sucked.  This new remaster drawns you in and you can't help but enjoy every second of it.  I love it.  I just wish they had more in the vaults that they could release after going thru this remaster process.
0316056863|3.0|I loved the book up until Tina entered the world of SNL.  She seems very pleased with herself, too much so.  She tries too hard.  It rubbed me the wrong way and now I can't watch her anymore.
B000022TSW|5.0|Product as described and shipped faster than expected; I couldn't ask for anything more. The movie is hilarious and never gets old.
1572814349|5.0|I bought this set for a friend who reads cards and I was intrigued by Kat Black's idea of using late Medieval and Renaissance artwork in the cards. He was not disappointed. The cards are extremely beautiful and different from the traditional cards. They come with an interpretation booklet, but if you don't know how to read cards, I would suggest some other information as well because the booklet is a superficial explanation. Also, there is a section explaining the origins of the artwork and what museums and collections they hang in. Very nice set.
0451191153|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters are very strong and relatable.  The book deals with the idea of doing something to please others versus doing something to please yourself.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I had some trouble snagging pieces or linking groups of pieces together but it worked in the end.  It's not like my income depends on it working right the first time.  Right?
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Bored.  I can't remember waiting for a movie to end for so long.  There was disappointment, but mostly boredom.  Might I add that there is little less credible in the world than Kristen Stewart's armored Snow White wielding sword.<br /><br />Another misleading trailer.  I thought I was in for a contemporary fairy tale with epic action.  Instead I yawned my way through two hours as Kristin \\"the one-look-Zoolander\\" Stewart sulked her way through another over-produced, underwritten movie with an emotionally bewildered expression which begs the question did somebody just fart?  [End rant]<br /><br />This really \\"could\\" have been epic.  Many snippets, scenes and concepts/ideas were excellent; it's just that many others were not.  The opening winter scene was stark, but oh so powerful (most memorable of the movie, I'd say).  But then it was largely followed by scenes shot too close up to enjoy the storybook grandeur.  However it wasn't all bleakly shot.  Formidable castlescapes impressed and the brilliant enchanted forest reminded me that there was some serious insight behind this film's production while also breaking the lowlight gray color palate of the scenes from The Dark Forest and the dungeon-like castle.  The fairy forest was like Ferngully meets Pandora, filled with all manner of enamoring CGI flora and fauna.  Conversely, the fairies seemed like something out of a Saturday morning children's show as if they were thrown together at the last minute before the movie's release.  These are but few examples of the inconsistent quality throughout the film.<br /><br />I thought this would be an action/adventure movie.  But it didn't feel like one.  The chthonic troll was my favorite critter.  But the action (i.e., between the troll and the huntsman) was brief, ill-imagined and ultimately anticlimactic.  The queen's glasswork soldiers are cool early in the movie as they shatter in slo-mo on the battlefield, but the scene is all about the effects and not about the action.  During the finale, these minions are animated semi-humanoid blobs of glass shards which move so fast you can't tell what they're doing.  I wish I could unsee that scene.  In general, the action in this movie was like poor quality background noise.  It was never the focus of any one scene, but it was always too distracting to ignore.  Anyone expecting Lord of the Rings quality sword fights or man-versus-creature bouts would likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Really, Charlize Theron's queen made for the best moods and moments.  Her wardrobe was creatively architected to look both painfully donned and elegant while royal with trappings of the macabre.  At times her acting may come off as a bit extreme, but hey--she \\"is\\" playing an evil aging witch queen obsessed with youth and power.  You could feel her desperation, pain, flagging sanity...oh yeah, and evil.  The best effects were cast on the queen's sorcery as she shifts form in disguise and agonizing aging.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth portrayed the right character the right way, but with the wrong lines, weak character development and no heroic scenes.  His action scenes either focus little on his character (rather the whole battle or situation) or result in him getting his butt kicked.  They also made the huntsman a depressed alcoholic widower, but offer little to justify his convenient noble transformation throughout the movie.  The dwarves, who in three minutes quickly shift from murderous rogues to stalwart allies, were really only as interesting as the actors you recognized behind the odd haircuts and facial prosthetics--namely Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost and Toby Jones.  They offer little to lighten the mood, in fact often distracting from the tone with too many weak lines, frequent and ineffective attempts at comic relief, and way too much screen time. Oh, right, and the \\"Prince\\" guy (William) felt like a completely needless character.<br /><br />Stacked upon all this is that a lot of things go unexplained.  Just because you can get away with that in a kid's fairy tale doesn't mean you can do that with the adult contemporary version.  I'm complaining a lot here, but the movie isn't necessarily to be skipped.  Many of the effects and scenes would be far more enjoyable on the big screen (or at least a large HDTV) with surround sound.  Just don't make a Friday night event out of it--save it for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  A portion of these scenes, effects and ideas are why I say this movie \\"could\\" have been epic.  The skill set was there.  But the writing wasn't--in terms of story fluidity and dialogue, that is.  But hey, this was director Rupert Sanders' first film.  For a first job, and one of such magnitude, he showed some serious imaginative chops...he just didn't do so consistently.  Keep an eye out for him in the future.<br /><br />WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) accomplished what this film was trying to.  Not your style?  Then I'd wind back the clock for some nostalgic darker fantasy fun.  How about Legend (1985), Labyrinth (1986), The Dark Crystal (1982), Wizards (1977), The Last Unicorn (1982), The Whiz (1978) or Return to Oz (1985).  Too old for you?

B005LAIHIQ|4.0|I am a true Dark Shadows fan. My most favorite is the revival series of the 90's starring Ben Cross I also like the old series with Jonathan Frid. This movie has some humor, but it's not a comedy which makes it worth watching. Johnny Depp did a good job acting and keeping the humorous moments light and they were actually funny and entertaining. I would suggest watching the new movie, it of course cannot compare to the other Dark Shadows, but for a movie of today it's a pretty good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a good read! One of those books that you just want to keep turning pages.  No, there is not a lot of cutting edge science basis in the book, but the author knows how to give you just enough detail to keep you interested and enough suspense for you to want to know what is happening next.  Just good fun!
B001AQR3E4|5.0|Great movie, excellent condition for a pre-watched movie. Watching this movie on Blu-ray just makes it that much better! The only thing is I wish it came in a real blu-ray case, not the crappy DVD size cases.

B000OY8NII|5.0|Eureka is one of my favorite shows of all time. LOVE LOVE LOVE the characters and I'm soooo sad to know this is their last season. Stupid Viacom pulling b/c it costs too much. Like they don't have the money. Besides, if you ask ANY of the fans, they wouldn't mind some more toned down episodes in special effects and gadgets if we got to keep the town sheriff. Seriously.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I recently purchased this game and can't even begin to play it. First it asks you to type your name but the vowels don't work for me. Then you have to select a color for your icon... well, none of them will select! I guess I'll try again later but I'm not happy about having spent money (even a small amount) for something that doesn't even work on my kindle fire. My husband has it on his fire and it works most of the time. We are both disappointed by this app though.

B001G8XON0|1.0|This is a fine example of a very expensive film that misses so many opportunities that it is difficult to count the ways.<br />First the music at the beginning of the film makes no sense-- it just doesn't - none of it relates to the historical (early 1900 hundreds), or cultural  (Paris??? or MTV).<br />The characters are cartoonish  and the sound is just too damn loud!!<br />I did love looking at Kidman and McGregor though- they are about the only thing that saves the picture.<br />How this movie got eight Academy Awards is beyond me.<br />I found it to be a total waist of time.

B006RXQ1L6|4.0|This Blue Ray disk is stunning to watch. If you haven't seen this Academy award winner (best picture 2002) it is a must. It answers the question \\"can they make em like they used to?\\"  the answer to that is a resounding yes.<br />If you are not ready for the close quick editing used at the start of the picture you might be left somewhat confused- but stay with it - a second viewing will reveal  its importance in getting the audience to make the necessary connections between the characters and plot the course of the story.<br />Well filmed - the sets and costumes are second to none and overall the movie provides a evening of good fun.

B003BW0CB6|2.0|Michael Connelly<br />THE REVERSAL<br />**<br />How far the mighty have fallen! Connelly's THE BLACK ECHO and THE CONCRETE BLOND are two of the best crime novels I have read. I've never liked this Lincoln lawyer of his even when he steps out of his limousine office and joins the conventional world. His obsession with himself, his child, and ex-wives is almost childish. Letting this defendant loose on the public in order for the police to catch him committing another crime is a crime in itself. His schemes and thoughts during the trial are immature and distracting as he focuses on the jury. His celebrations of touching and squeezing his co-council is almost sexual and to do this in front of the judge and jury defies credibility. I think this will be my last Connelly for even the later Bosch novels degenerated into touchy feely bunk.

1861976127|5.0|This is a great book and a great read.  A book about punctuation is a great read!<br /><br />If you are trying to be a better writer, this is the \\"Strunk & White\\" of the 21st century, or at least one of them.  Rules of grammar, including punctuation, can be tedious.  This is a wonderful way around that.  I have spent hours and hours with tomes regarding the rules of spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc.  These books are useful but NOT something you'd actually read.<br /><br />While this isn't a new publication it is new to me and a refreshing change.  It's cheap at Amazon and well worth the price.

I finally deleted the book off of my Kindle so I wouldn't want to throw the Kindle at the wall!  There is a following here of bitter people who attack you if you do not just LOVE this book.  So suck it folks! Not everyone has to love this book!

B000006UD8|5.0|This 1972 release by English heavy metal group Deep Purple is thunderous; a massive wall of progressive hard rock that overwhelms at times.  Although I have not listened to this record in a long (long) time, the memories came back pretty quickly and it is every bit as good as I remember it being.  Better even, because there no skips and pops with the CD format.<br /><br />For me, the Mk. II lineup defined the Deep Purple sound; the ensemble playing and group dynamic that they established on Machine Head is awesome.  Roger Glover (love the tone he gets out of his Rickenbacker bass) and drummer Ian Paice burn on this album and Ritchie Blackmore proves himself a virtuoso on the electric guitar.  I am a huge fan of Jon Lord's Hammond organ playing - he runs it through a fuzz box (I think) which gives his organ a simply ferocious sound - the classical flourishes are also nice.  Last but certainly not least, is lead singer (screamer) Ian Gillan.  This guy has one of the most powerful voices in rock (then and now); a voice that occupies a space somewhere between Peter Hammill and Arthur Brown.<br /><br />Although Highway Star and (especially) Smoke on the Water suffered from overplaying on the radio, the album still sounds fresh today - the sound on Machine Head is not dated in the least.  Many of the tracks are built around (awesome) riffs - the guys vary the riffs though, so they do not simply lapse into an endless ostinato over which solos are layered.  There is a somewhat improvisational feel to certain of the tracks - this would be explored further on the live album Made in Japan (1972). My favorite tracks include Pictures of Home and the bluesy track Lazy - this is a great tune to jam to.<br /><br />This remastered album is great and features liner notes by Roger Glover, a few extra tracks (singles), and various remixes of the album (one by Roger in 1997).  The 1997 remix sounds like a \\"live in the studio\\" recording - the remix of Lazy is excellent.  There are also quadrophonic mixes of a few tunes.  I have to admit that I am a stick in the mud when it comes to these things and really have no interest in the extra tracks (I have the vinyl album burned into my mind).  However, they should prove of interest to fans.  The sound quality of the original remastered album is outstanding.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fantastic album of hard rock that boasts the definitive Deep Purple sound.  Highly recommended along with the blistering In Rock (1970), the more experimental Fireball (1971), and one of the landmark live rock albums Made in Japan (1972).uadrophonic mixes of a few tunes.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|I think this is my favorite so far.  I LOVED #1, thought #2 was good, and loved this one as well.  The second one had a little too much political drama for my taste, I had trouble following all the characters and war-related stuff.  This one was just as addictive as the others and easier to follow.  The storylines are a bit ridiculous, there's no way so many things would happen to one person, but as long as you go into it expecting a story instead of realism, you'll do just fine.  :)
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers, a selection of the Riverfront Book Club, is a realistic commentary on the foster care system in America that often leaves children emotionally scarred, angry and bitter. In alternating chapters of past and present, the reader meets Victoria, recently emancipated from foster care, homeless and desperately seeking her place in a world that seems hostile and empty. Victoria is rescued by Renata, a florist with emotional issues of her own, and through their relationship, both come to a new understanding of what it means to be part of a family. This is a story about forgiveness, second chances and the power of love as its characters Victoria, Elizabeth, Renata and Grant learn to express their emotions in ways that foster self healing, emotional intimacy and finally, trust and self-acceptance. Victoria learns that she is not the only human being that is flawed. Once she accepts responsiblity for her years of violence and self-destructive behavior, she begins to understand how to create a new and healthy reality for herself and those she begins to love. At the end of the novel, Victoria learns that moss grows without roots--that love is imperfect and can grow anywhere when one's heart is open.<br /><br />The descriptions and details of the flowers and the techniques of florist work provide beauty and solace in comparison to the painful realities of the character's lives.<br /><br />The ending is one of hope and reconciliation.
B007G92QGO|4.0|In her novel 'We Need to Talk About Kevin', Lionel Shriver gave us a 'fundamentally evil' child and an obnoxiously self-centred unreliable narrator in his mother.  In 'Defending Jacob', Landay approaches similar territory, but with a more fascinatingly complex view on the narrator character and his wife, something a lot closer to sympathy for the fourteen-year-old boy - and a tense courtroom drama as well.<br /><br />This is a pacy, taut, twisting tale that examines Jacob himself in leisurely, almost laconic detail.  His father, the sometimes-sharp-as-a-tack narrator, has his own secrets, blind spots and failings, which we intermittently see more or less clearly.  His mother, similarly, drifts in and out of the zone of our empathy: the picture of her fluctuates between that of an almost standard over-emotionally self-righteous wife character and something a lot more complicated and off-beam. No one is 'right', even at the end, and this is one of the many ways in which 'Defending Jacob' is good.<br /><br />The courtroom set-pieces are expertly and knowledgeably dramatised, with shifting characterisations that push us way out into a sea of uncertainty and tension, excited about the outcome but really not sure what side we ought to be on.<br /><br />It's very well worth a read (and a much better book than 'Kevin').

I loved the way this one started, and I stuttered, eh I mean I shuddered to think of poor Evie with that devil St. Vincent.  I actually do love the hero to be BAD to the bone and then turn up sweet! I thought their trip to Gretna Green was fun(for me-not them). I thought this was an interesting plot, a lot happening that surprised me. Enjoyed visiting with Cam and Westcliff and Lillian again.  Very clever how the bad guy gets his comeupance! I must say that St. Vincent was quite the amorous guy!!!  It took two days to read the 455 pages, all very smooth reading.  I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.

B006JTS5OO|4.0|Muppets are back on screen. Well, they have come back not in the way I wanted, though. The new Muppet film remains enjoyable throughout, but sometimes two human characters Gary (Jason Segel) and his sweetheart Mary (Amy Adams) almost dominate \\"The Muppet\\" that should belong to Jim Henson characters.<br /><br />The story is basically about Gary, Mary and Gary's \\"brother\\" Walter ... and Walter is a Muppet, who is a big fan of the original Muppet show. The three travel to Hollywood, where they learn that Kermit, Miss Piggy and other Muppet characters are not popular anymore. To protect their Muppet Studio from the greedy billionaire, the three travelers and Kermit plan to organize a show once again with other Muppet character to raise the money.<br /><br />With Gary, Mary and Walter as the main characters, the script (by Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller) does not give much time for each Muppet character to shine. Chris Cooper plays \\"Tex Richman,\\" a villain attempting to sabotage the show. I am a fan of Chris Cooper, but with all respect he is hardly the right choice for the comedic role.<br /><br />But to me the biggest problem of \\"The Muppets\\" is the key concept of the film - people have forgotten the Muppets. But do they? Or do we? The self-referential jokes are refreshing at first, but soon they get tired simply because we just don't buy the idea. With special appearances of guest stars including jack Black, \\"the Muppets\\" is a joyful ride, but it could have been much better with less humans and more Muppets.

Terrorist-anti-terrorist oriented novels certainly make us look at life and freedom.

0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay is the last of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It follows Katniss as she learns about District 13 which is a communist sort of society. No capitalism for sure.  People don't get to see much sun and all eat the same meager servings of food.  No one starves but people are programmed. Katniss struggles against this and is considered basically mentally off but they can't get rid of her anymore than anyone else as she is a symbol.<br /><br />The book follows the rebellion and Katniss is used as a show piece for the rebels but manages as time goes on to make contributions to the resistance.<br /><br />One of the problems with these books is that there is no basis for her thoughts and actions. There has never been a culture without some sort of belief in a higher power or some sort of standards.  This is sort of like modern television from which the author acknowledged she got her ideas from.  It has all the morality of reality tv which is to say none.  Katniss is supposed to be good but kills a woman when she breaks in her home without a thought.  The woman is an innocent bystander who could have been tied up instead but is shot dead.  The book ends with little hope for people.  I guess this is what modern day media is creating. A little grim for the young.
0871404133|1.0|1.0 out of 5 stars A HERO FALLS FROM GRACE, June 4, 2012<br /><br />By Featherless Biped - See all my reviews<br /><br />Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)<br />This review is from: The Social Conquest of Earth (Hardcover)<br /><br />Wilson has always been one of my heros--not only an outstanding biologist, but one of the tiny and vanishing minority of intellectuals who at least dares to hint at the truth others studiously avoid.<br /><br />I found sections with the usual incisive commentary (though nothing really new or interesting if you have read his other works and are up on biology in general) in the often stilted prose that is his hallmark, but was quite surprised that the core of the book is his rejection of inclusive fitness (which has been a mainstay of evolutionary biology for over 40 years) in favor of group selection. One assumes that coming from him and published in major peer reviewed journals like Nature, it must be a substantial advance in spite of the fact that I knew group selection had always been nearly universally rejected due to its basic conflict with our understanding of evolutionary biology.<br /><br />I have read all the reviews here and on the net and many have good comments but the one I most wanted to see was that by renowned science writer and evolutionary biologist<br />Richard Dawkins. Unlike most of those by professionals, which are in journals only available to those with access to a university, it is readily available on the net.<br /><br />Sadly one finds a devastating rejection of the book and some of the most trenchant commentary on a scientific colleague I have ever seen from Dawkins--exceeding anything I recall<br />even in his many exchanges with late and unlamented demagogue and pseudoscientist Stephan Jay Gould. Although Gould was infamous for his personal attacks on his Harvard colleague<br />Wilson, Dawkins notes that much of this book reminds one uncomfortably of Goulds frequent lapses into \\"bland, unfocussed ecumenicalism\\".<br /><br />Dawkins points out that Wilson's 2010 paper in Nature was almost universally rejected by over 140 biologists who responded with letters and that there is not one word about this in<br />Wilson's book. Nor does Wilson correct this in his public lectures. There is no choice but to agree with Dawkin's trenchant comment \\"For Wilson not to acknowledge that he speaks for himself against the great majority of his professional colleagues is--it pains me to say this of a lifelong hero --an act of wanton arrogance.\\" I feel like one of the stunned people one sees on TV being interviewed after the nice man next door, who has been babysitting everyone's children for 30 years, is exposed as a serial killer.<br /><br />Dawkins also points out (once again) that inclusive fitness is entailed by (i.e.,logically follows from) neodarwinism and cannot be rejected without rejecting evolution itself. Wilson again reminds us of Gould, who denounced creationists from one side of his mouth while giving them comfort by spewing endless ultraliberal marxist tinged gibberish about spandrels,punctuated equilibrium and evolutionary psychology from the other. The vagueness of group and multilevel selection is just what the softminded want to enable them to escape<br />rational thinking in their endless antiscientific postmodernist word salads.<br /><br />It is rare that scientists responding to devastating criticism actually admit their mistakes and Wilson and his Harvard math colleages, who wrote the now infamous trash paper in the famous journal Nature in 2010 (you can also do yourself a favor by avoiding Martin Nowak's books),are no exception, failing to respond in any meaningful way in their replies.<br /><br />Worse yet, Wilson's book is a poorly thought out and sloppily written mess full of nonsequiturs, vague ramblings, confusions and incoherence. A good review that details some of these is that by graduate student Gerry Carter which you can find on the net. Wilson is also out of touch with our current understanding of evolutionary psychology (EP)(see e.g., the last 300 pages of Pinker's \\"The Better Angels of our Nature\\"). If you want a serious account of social evolution and some relevant EP from a<br />biological standpoint see Principles of Social Evolution by Andrew F.G. Bourke,or a not quite so serious and admittedly flawed and rambling account but a must read nevertheless by Robert Trivers--The Folly of Fools: The Logic of Deceit and Self-Deception in Human Life and older but still current and penetrating works such as The Evolution of Cooperation: Revised Edition by Robert Axelrod and The Biology of Moral Systems by Richard Alexander.<br /><br />I see no point in repeating others comments so I will end with a remark I recall reading a half century ago--I think by the famous philosopher Bertrand Russell--<br />that one can find even in the best minds a \\"nest of furry caterpillars\\". We have now seen Wilson's and it is not a pretty sight.o out of touch with our current understanding of evolutionary psychology (EP)(see e.g., the last 300 pages of Pinker's \\"The Better Angels of our Nature\\").

0439023491|3.0|This book is pretty much more of the same with a few twists and turns as Katniss begins to see there are people who are willing to save her and Peeta.  No reason why other than the reader suspects that Katniss has stirred something in them.  Is she stirring this or is it Haymitch and others manipultating her.<br /><br />One thing is that for no reason these people just seem to want to stop the killing of Peeta and Katniss.  There is no mention of ethics, codes of honor, religion.  Just some people want to save them.  Katniss is a little naive at times in not understanding what is going on.  Okay book.  The movie will make lots of money.
B005LAIGLO|4.0|So many different crime capers come out every month in theaters and on DVD that it's sometimes hard to decide which ones to watch and which ones to avoid. I'm not over saturated by the genre so I enjoy most of the ones I see. \\"Contraband\\" is now on my list of films I'd recommend.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"Contraband\\" will satisfy movie lovers with the amount of special features and a quality feature that will entertain viewers. There's a lot of pervasive language, a good amount of violence, and some drug use in this. However, it's no more than what fans of these types of crime thrillers are already used to.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe has shed his Harry Potter persona in this scary victorian-era thriller.<br /><br />Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a lawyer who has recently lost his wife during childbirth.  Kipps has been given one last chance to prove his worth to his employer.  He is assigned to travel to Crythin Gifford to resolve the affairs of a recently deceased woman.  Upon arriving, Kipps receives a chilling response from the townspeople, except for Sam (Ciaran Hinds).<br /><br />Journeying to the remote mansion located deep in the marshes, Kipps begins to uncover a gruesome tale of death as well as the mysterious \\"Woman in Black\\".  Many of village's children have died, and each time, the mysterious woman has been present.  While in the mansion, Kipps has seen ghostly apparitions and heard mysterious noises.  Soon, Kipps is engulfed in a terrifying quest to discover the truth about the deaths of the children while trying to unlock the mystery of the woman in black.<br /><br />I thought this was a good movie, but I did have some difficulty following it in certain parts.  Radcliffe and Hinds give good performances, and there are some very scary scenes, but there were parts where I couldn't follow along.  I originally saw this movie in the theater and I was hoping that by watching it on DVD, I would get more clarity.  I was able to pick more up by watching it on DVD, but there were still parts that left me confused.  However, there are some very scary parts in the movie, and the story is good.  I recommend this movie, but just be prepared to watch closely.

Can you please address that or does that piss you off and make you want to pull your gun and shoot me, MAN?\\" The book was way disappointing in that he does often come off as a spoiled drug-addled narcissist. Perhaps a failure of the editor...who no doubt feared being shot and killed by a man whose synapses have long ago been destroyed and can no longer release the proper amounts of endorphins to calm him down.  As a Stones fan I was WAY disappointed.

0345529057|5.0|This series is reallyyyy hard to get into because you are introduces to so many characters right from the start and it is written in very old English; however, once you get going, it's a great read! I carry a pocket dictionary around with me to look up any words I am unfamiliar with but towards the middle I didn't need it anymore because I was used to the writing.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|They get better and better! I highly recomend buying a Kindle...much more handy than a book. Stieg Larson is a genious!
0345803507|2.0|I was expecting a lot more with all the publicity it got.  I found it to be a little shallow.  Hoping the next one is better as I bought all three.
B003VANOFY|4.0|(Update April 2015) Fortunately I haven't experienced the broken joint issue again. Logitech replaced both headsets that I had issues with. One of those headsets did eventually break the charging connecter inside the headset, but that may have been due to being yanked on while the charging cable was plugged in. It was well over two years old, so I retired it. I've dealt with several 930's now and have seen the broken ear cup connector twice and the broken USB charging cable connector twice. So, try not to abuse them if you own a set.   I've tried some other headsets since, even the Astro A50 (bad microphones), and this is still my go to recommended headset. Especially for the value. This still seems to be the leader for range and is a solid performer in all other areas. Not perfect, but no deal breakers.  (Original review) There's a major design flaw. The plastic covers that go over the pivot point of the ear cups break. I have 3 of these and two have broken the same exact way. After doing some research it's a common problem. I would not suggest purchasing these because they will most likely break at some point. Also they do cut out occasionally, but come right back on.  I liked these so much I purchased 3 sets. One broke and just received the replacement set and I notice a second set is now broke in the exact same way. The sound and range are great, so it's sad to see such a glaring problem that could have been easily avoided with a cheap solution of cheap metal covers instead of thin plastic ones at a stress point.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is one of the best Bible apps. Easy to use with a lot of great features for those interested in Bible study. It is great for use in church and at home.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|The second of three, as good as the first and the message is coming clearer - rebellion against concertive control is somehow linked to the situation we find in the modern world.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This three book set is all the rage. I've started with \\"50 Shades of Gray\\". It's simple, predictive, formulaic, and only mildly erotic. But maybe it's the kick-start to something we've lost in this Country. That being the ability to relax and say, \\"It's just sex.\\" For the most enjoyment have your wife, girlfriend (or both) read it out loud to you. It's written in the female voice and as a man you'll enjoy it that much more.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|What a great story, characters well developed and I defy you to put it down.  Make sure you have book 2 ready to start...
B0015DYIH2|2.0|Before I begin this review, let me say that I'm not a teenager (I'm 39), I'm a woman and mother of a toddler, who fortunately knows nothing about these books and almost certainly won't get to read them. I believe by then the (to me at least) undeserved hype will be over with.<br />Secondly, I'm not into sappy love stories or vampire lore. So why did I ever read this so called saga? Good question. I'm still wondering myself. The main reason, I guess, is I enjoy YA fiction (JK Rowling, Philip Pullman) and, since I'm a very amateur writer myself, I decided it was worth checking out the Twilight books to find a key on how to write a good, compelling story in this genre, may it be about vampires or not. I wanted to learn from it, honestly. I did learn, but not in the way I was hoping I would.<br />I agree with 99 per cent of what's being said in other reviews about Bella's character. I don't think it's flat, just plain unlikeable. I did relate to her in the first part of the first book, moving from home, facing a new school and new people, with her anxiety and so on. But then her way of handling her relationships with friends and family and her totally passive obsession with Edward put me off it completely.<br />I had been expecting vampires to be mysterious creatures, dangerous and tormented, not a bunch of Beverly Hills kids with tons of money and clothes and whatever else. Or, even so, that this superficiality would be treated as such, not as something to be pursued (beauty, money and so on), but as values that do not in themselves grant happiness. Which in this story they do, since Bella gets all of that. I agree with her not deserving the perfectly wrapped up happy ending.<br />I also agree with most of the ethical issues that have been raised about mysogyny, paedophilia, domestic abuse, lobotomy (ie imprinting) and so on. I found them disturbing, but I would have tolerated their presence had they been delved more deeply into and shown their negative sides, had theybeen thought-provoking, but this doesn't seem to be the case.<br />However, I'll try to be true to Oscar Wilde when he says that books are either well-written or not but they are not meant to be judged on their underlying morals, whether they be present or not. Aside from that, then, the books have never worked for me, for two main reasons.<br />The first reason is that they have no plot, no substance, no purpose. SM has said it herself that the concept of her story stems from a dream she had. Nothing wrong with that, but it shows very explicitly and the inspiration from the dream culminates in chapter 13 of Twilight. She built up the story to get there. We may like the way she did it or not, but that's where she was headed.<br />After that climax, the whole thing began to go downwards, because, from my point of view, SM herself didn't know what to do with the story or her characters anymore. They had no purpose, nothing specific to do. They had no real war to fight, nothing or no one to find or rescue, no place to go, no mission to accomplish (except for Bella to become a vampire, which I thought was ludicrous from the start. I did expect her to become one, but not to be obsessed by the idea, rather to be forced into it by necessity; in a way that's how it was, but I found this to be, as the main storyline, quite poor and against logic). The story just develops around the relationship Bella/Edward, which is established half way through the first book and is never really in danger since.<br />This is the first big problem in the book. Episodes follow each other, quite slowly, including a lot of cheesy dialog (most of Twilight was made of questions and answers: today is my turn to ask questions, tomorrow is your turn. Come on, what kind of suspense is that?), without a specific drive. There are plenty of characters, many of whom quite interesting. They would have made a good story if only they'd had something to actually \\"do\\". The flashbacks about their past were intriguing, but they were placed here or there at random without any action justifying their being brought up. I remember Rosalie's. She and Bella just sit on the bed: let me tell you about my story and so on. It would have been so much more interesting if this flashback had been introduced in a moment when Rosalie's life had been at stake, or she had done something dramatic or had disappeared or something to that effect and the Cullens had justified her behavior by bringing up her past. Ninety per cent of the books are based on talking, smooching, throwing parties, picking dresses. This doesn't work for me, not when I'm pushing forty, but it wouldn't have worked at sixteen either.<br />Every volume is built in much the same way: a prologue trying to capture the reader's attention with the foreshadowing of some kind of dramatic event, which proves to be not that dramatic, a long section of talking, romance, teen stuff that has no real relevance except to a very young audience, a final part with some action to justify the existence of the book itself, action which is often not described because Bella isn't in it or because it is resolved let's say \\"diplomatically\\" (again, talking).<br />This gives me the opportunity to explore the other main problem the book has, which SM herself, IMO, realized, albeit a little late: the use of the first person is great in that it gets you more deeply involved with the character and its predicaments, but it shuts you out of what other characters do and in this series, since Bella is the least active of all the characters both because of her personality and for her being an ordinary mortal, this happens in all the crucial moments. This is why awkward devices are introduced in order to be able to show some scenes that we otherwise would not be able to see, being stuck with Bella, such as a showdown between Edward and Jacob. We get to see them arguing in the tent but only because Bella is in the sleeping bag with Jacob pretending to be asleep. How believable is that (I loved someone's remark about an electric blanket)? And how believable is it that a guy who tampers with a girl's car to prevent her from going to see his rival would then take her cheating sitting down (the kiss between Jacob and Bella in Eclispse) and even suggest she has kids with said rival (in Breaking Dawn)?<br />As I said, I think SM realized this herself, since she turns over to Jacob's POV in the last bit of Eclipse and in a full book in Breaking Dawn. How else would she have been able to show the whole impriting process, all of Jacob's internal struggle, his relationship with the pack and so on? Impossible to do through Bella's first person POV. I actually appreciated this part, and I think SM herself enjoyed the change, but it was inconsistent with the writing strategy used throughout.<br />Overall, there were some parts of the books I liked and mostly they were the ones not concerning the romantic highschool storyline, but Jacob's discovering his real nature and all the part about the wolves and the pack and some flashbacks about how the other characters got to be vampires. I also think that SM did a pretty good job of creating the atmosphere and the environment about her characters. But all this was not well played out. The Leah character is compelling and easy to relate to, at least for me, but she's dropped half way through the book so that Jacob can imprint on the baby. I won't even get started on this plot twist or on the baby's name and so on (considering the almost non-existent relationship between Bella and her parents I don't see how she would pick their names for the child anyway).<br />Finally, Breaking Dawn to me as an adult was slightly more exciting (though gruesome and gory) because at least it had some development. Yes, it reads like a horror story, but that's what I thought vampires were supposed to be about all along. Otherwise we could just have been content with the average girl meets highschool hunk, they get together, marry and have kids. Too late to turn to this genre in the end, though, it was not really consistent with the previous tone and with the audience it was meant for. I haven't seen the movie (I haven't seen any of them, to be honest) so I wonder how that was avtually played out.<br />Summing up, the story had a good premise and an interesting concept, but it could have been so much better developed. Instead, it turned out to be a commercial success with very little substance.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|The third of three and as good a read as both the others.  The world rebels against the pigeon-holing of society and shows that the \\"commoners\\" can win if they act together.  No-one can change the world on their own but en masse...
B00873GRU4|5.0|Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey, kindle edition.<br />I have been an avid reader all of my 73 years of all types of books except science fiction.  I have only read 2 science fiction books.  After reading the reviews of this book I decided to give it a go.  I found the story really gripping and had trouble putting it down at times.  I enjoyed it so much that I now want to try some other science fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i am going to write a short review so you guys dont have to spend 10 minutes ln reading all the other 30 page reviews :) this book is really good i could not put it down… it was very discriptive and interesting and violent, to tell the truth tho the begining (first 2-3 chapters) were just description and it was kind of boring at first but then when it got more into the book it became  very very interesting… so interesting you would stay up all night for 3 days reading all three of the books! i highly recomend this wonderfull book. unless you are  younger than the age of 10! enjoy and LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|A wonderful tribute to the relationship between a child and his father. Although fictional, this story can be the everyman's story about the father developing the son. And the learning that the boy becomes the man through the model of the father and yet by achieving his own adventure. Nicely portrayed. Well acted. Does not overplay the fall of the towers.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe was terrific as Arthur Kipps a Lawyer given a last chance from his employer to keep his job. Arthur Kipps lost his wife during child-birth of their son 4 years ago, he is still grieving for her and has been down on his luck ever since. He is to get the paperwork of the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow of Eel Marsh House sorted and look to see if she made a will. But when he gets to the village of Cryphin Gifford his reception is anything but pleasant or welcoming. Lucky for Arthur Kipps he befriended Mr Daily on the train who gives him a ride to the Inn.<br /><br />As Arthur moves around the village children are pulled into houses, doors and windows are shut and curtains drawn. Where ever he goes people want him to leave and when he finally gets to Eel Marsh House the gloomy and very spooky house is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a woman that is dressed in black. The more time he spends at Eel Marshy House the more afraid the villagers and Arthur Kipps become.<br /><br />The longer he stays the more fearful the villagers get and the more accidents claim their children. This movie is one that will scare you out of your seats, the atmosphear builds and builds and releases to make you jump and scream. I loved this movie and the ending is one that surprized me. This is a movie that will not dissapoint you.<br />[[ASIN:B005LAIGOQ The Woman in Black (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Story about a TV game where the contestants kill each other? Sounds grim and simplistic? Nothing could be further from the truth. This book is well written covering many ethical dilemmas of pitting people against each other simply for the pleasure of others. Every step of the character's journey makes you ask the same question \\"What would I do if it were me?\\".
0751548553|3.0|One other reviewer said that the storyline drew him in and he almost couldn't put it down. I felt the very same way. Good characters, well defined, a great opening and the whole scenario with the photo and why Logan must find the girl in the picture. However, as the story progresses it slips to some cheapness in the villain category and a very very very predictable ending. A disappointment given how well the story played out before that.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Some interesting content but the main character, while initially engaging, lacked strength... Even taking into account her age. Considering the hype I was disappointed and felt that the extremes of wealth discussed were at times unnecessary. But all three books are good summer 'popcorn' reads...
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive. After I beat it once I started over to play it again. It is very well organized andthe challenge level is just right.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|My own personal nerd finally got me to watch `Avatar'. Since I've studied Jamestown, VA in the early 1600s quite a bit, I instantly recognized that Avatar is the `Hollywood-version' of John Smith and Pocahontas, not accurate, but their opinion of it.<br />In real life John Smith was a short, round, red-headed, 45-year-old man, and Pocahontas was a cute, petite, happy-go-lucky, 12-year-old. If you can see Joanie Cunningham having a crush on Howard Cunningham instead of Chachi then...suuuuure, that's how it happened.<br />Anyway...no new story under the sun.<br />This new blue Pocahontas is portrayed as all tuned into nature exactly the way Disney portrayed Miss Poca. The new blue Poca also runs around wearing nothing but decorations much like the real Poca is described in the history books, I could go on, but I'll spare us all.

0439023491|3.0|I found \\"Catching Fire\\" to be far too much like \\"The Hunger Games\\" except that our heroes are no longer newbies to the games, but veterans. Otherwise it was the same bunch of characters with the same issues and the same situation. Some things hinted at are never expanded on, but are apparently put off for the next book. Although I like the characters and even the style in which the story is written (although I usually don't go for first person, present tense) \\"Catching Fire seemed too much a rehash of the first book, with the first half being dedicated to preparing for the games and the second half being the killing of the tributes. Still, I'll read the next book because I have to see how it all turns out. I just expected a little more from the second book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it and its just great its awesome if you want a great game well here it is .

B0014DQSG2|4.0|(by John's wife, Julie)<br />There are your normal anticipations satisfied in this very light romantic comedy (some over-acting and a lot of predictability) but you'll come away feeling happy that you watched \\"What a Girl Wants.\\"<br /><br />The best line and one that every teenager should post on their mirror:  \\"Why are you trying so hard to fit in when you're born to stand out?\\"<br /><br />So grab your coffee, tea, or cocoa, put your feet up, and enjoy the film!
0743454537|4.0|The book is generally pretty good. It contains mostly likeable, interesting characters that you learn more about as time passes on. Though many people rant on about the ending I like books with those type of abrupt/messed up endings so yeah. I'm making this a vague review because should just read it and judge it by themselves and stuff.
B006LEHOL2|3.0|I've followed Sinead's career since her 1987 debut, so I'm a devoted fan. I can admit when some of her work isn't that great or simply not that accessible (2007's Theology, with the exception of a few nice tracks, 2003's \\"Sean Nos Nua\\" is too specialized, 2000's \\"Faith and Courage\\" was spotty at best--very hit and miss).<br /><br />But I'm happy to say, this new album is her most consistent, since 1994's underrated gem, \\"Universal Mother\\". Like that album, it's very personal, it has some brilliant moments, as well as some quieter less accessible tracks.<br /><br />But \\"How about I be Me..\\" is a much more focused and upbeat album, if Sinead ever had an upbeat album.<br /><br />The opening track \\"4th and Vine\\" is sweet and pleasant, but sounds more like a throwaway reggae ditty, unfortunately. Its simplicity is a little disappointing for an opening track. Sinead isn't at the top of her game here.<br />The next track \\"Reason With Me\\" is a nice departure for Sinead--deceptively simple lyrics and melody, with a surprisingly catchy hook/piano chords that Sinead normally doesn't employ in her songs.<br />\\"Old Lady\\" is a nice rocker, with a pop fusion. This is Sinead the rocker we love: it's fun and edgy at the same time.<br />\\"Take Off Your Shoes\\" is a solid old-school Sinead track. This should have been the album opener. It's intense, melodic, and cathartic. What we love about Sinead.<br />\\"Back Where We Belong\\" is one of the more heartfelt and softer tracks. Its greatest strength is the vocal delivery--Sinead does a beautiful job. It's another 'story' song as well.<br />\\"Wolf is Getting Married\\" is another highlight--it's vintage Sinead, with a new pop sensibility. It's endlessly catchy, while beautiful and meaningful. In a better world, this would be a hit on the pop charts. But it's not flashy enough for today's commercial audience.<br />\\"Queen of Denmark\\" is a great cover.. it's another good rocker. It takes a while to grow on me.<br />\\"Very Far From Home\\" is one of the weaker tracks. It feels like a throwaway b-side track. The sentiment and execution just don't have the resonance to carry the song.<br />\\"I Had a Baby\\" is the other weak track on the album overall--for the same reason. It's execution lacks urgency or potency.<br />\\"VIP\\" is surprisingly powerful, for a near acapella track. But if any singer can pull of acapella, it's Sinead and her pipes. This is a song where the execution does pay off. Sinead's lyrics and performance are just very focused and dynamic. That's what makes a song work.<br /><br />So overall, this is Sinead's best album of original material, since 1994's \\"Universal Mother\\". It makes you wonder why it took so long? The songs seem to flow pretty effortlessly, save for a couple of minor weak tracks.<br /><br />Keep it up, Sinead!
1609611543|5.0|This book, after getting by the first 20 pages or so, reads like a mystery novel. I had a hard time putting it down. What the author, a cardiologist, says in this book is easy to understand, even though there are many technical and medical words I can't pronounce. The author certainly and clearly makes his point while scaring the living begeebers out of the reader: If you want you and your family to be healthy in all ways, get all forms of wheat out of your diet. This may seem like a tall task, but like many of my friends, who all introduced me to this book, and all of whom have lost weight following the author's advice, it is not all that difficult. The weight almost comes off by itself. I have already lost twenty pounds in a couple of months.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to many of my other friends. But, see for yourself. Get the book at your library, or order it from Amazon, or at your local book store. Those who are following it like me, are losing weight, and feel much better with no wheat in our diets.<br /><br />I  have no affiliation with the author, publisher, diet related organizations, Amazon, or any other book seller. I am just enthusiastic about this book and the message it is offering to everyone who wants to control their weight. If one person reads book, and they, or perhaps their children, benefit as a result of this review, it will have been well worth my time spent submitting it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy!  I muist say that it is better to get the trilogy since the books flow more like chapters.  The huge buzz about the sex makes one think that's all there is...yes, there is a lot of sex, but there's a great story....Can't wait for the movie!

0062197258|5.0|This is a very well-written, well-edited book - it's hard to believe it's the author's debut. I found myself engrossed in the story, even though it has two writing devices that I dislike. First, it has a couple of transcripts inserted, which I normally consider a lazy way out of writing a descriptive scene, but they work here because they're used with restraint. Second, the story shifts back and forth in time, which means the reader has to keep adjusting to the narrative. This also works, though, because it creates a low-level of anxiety in the reader which parallels the anxiety in the heroine. Catherine - later Cathy - has good reason to be anxious. Falling for a charming, handsome man, she discovers she's been snared by a sociopath. What is worse than a control freak whose violence escalates? The knowledge that he has disarmed your friends and none of them believe you. It's as if The Terminator has taken over your life, and there's no escape but death. Catherine does her best to escape; laden with emotional baggage, she tries to reconstruct her life and tentatively explore the possibility of a new relationship. But the past catches up to her. After all she's been through, with her emotional fragility, can she stand up to the new terror? Will it ever end? The characters are well drawn and not over-the-top. I did note that there weren't enough variations in dialogue, but it wasn't a major issue. In real life (and in good books) people speak in individual ways, but here all the characters speak alike. Everyone has verbal tics. In a book, if characters don't have different patterns of speech, it can be hard to tell them apart, either literally or by personality. Overall, this is a well-done book and I look forward to reading her next one.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is a story based off a Stephen King novel (he suprisingly toned down the supernatural elements) about a man who may or may not have killed his wife and is sent to 'two life sentences' for each person. The story however is told through Morgan Freeman with his usual excellent narration, and the majority of the story takes place in the grey frigid prison, and the length of the movie helped emphasize the feeling most of the characters had of spending most of their life behind bars.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly great, my favorite probably being the greaser that comes mid-way into the movie because he had such a type-cast role of a misfit but he exceeded expectations. As the story progresses Tim Robbin's motivations are consistently vague but his intentions of making the other inmates lives better are clear. One thing I really liked about this movie is the antagonist of the movie is always replaced by an even worse one, first it starts out with the rapist, then he's replaced by the main guard, then the main gaurd is just the henchman of the Warden, the biggest P.O.S. of them all, really well done.<br /><br />I don't know what else to really say without ruining it, just watch the damn thing.
0060899220|1.0|I remembered reading this a long time ago and thought it was great. That was before I owned restaurants. Today I read an adjective self involved mans version of the restaurant business he drops names and adjectives not to descibe the location,or time to imagine yourself with him on the journey. He drops them like a puffed up parrot to show his use of the english language and dillusion of being a poet with a great team of public relations people that were in the right place as people wanted to know what goes on the kitchen. I couldn't get through this book this time, it was time consuming painful and wordy. I picked it up 4 times skipping chapters hoping it would get better and I was left disgusted with the book, myself for buying it, and wasting my time. I enjoy Bourdain on the travel channel so much more he's photogenic, tall, handsome, quirky, and more real. He must have better editors on tv.
B004LWZW6U|2.0|Piranha 3DD is a spectacular failure on almost all accounts. The director who's credentials include all the Feast movies can't maintain one good scene to save his life, every scene is an underwhelming void of entertainment. I don't even know where to start with this turd, but seriously, how do you f*** up Piranha's in a water park? That's like the easiest formula for cheap entertainment.<br /><br />-The Story: The story is great in theory, the piranha's for some unimportant reason can break through steel so they can get into water pipes, so they'll inevitably invade the water park on opening day (Jaws anyone?). The delivery however, is bafflingly terrible. You only see the water park in the first and last ten minutes of the movie, and the middle chunk of the film is devoted to three teens in a love-triangle going on a scooby doo adventure. Remember in the previous Piranha where Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames investigate the corpse on the docks and discover it's Piranha attacks? Yeah, that piece of the story is stretched out to the majority of the movie in this snooze-fest.<br /><br />Characters:<br />-The main characters are lame, weak, tired, boring, predictable stereotypes. We have the virtuous 'last girl' who's going to school, is abhorred by sex, and is between two guys, the cop-douchebag and the misunderstood nice guy, no further explanation necessary.<br />-David Koechner plays the amusement park's 51% owner (why a girl in college owns the other 49%, nevertheless cares so much about it is beyond me) who plays the smutty step-dad who wants to sexualize The Big Wet, unfortunately that's all he does and he doesn't get really campy or over the top until the very end.<br />-David Hasselhoff plays himself at the park in a hilarious way, a burned out celebrity that doesn't really care about what he's doing, Hasselhoff made me laugh a few times which is why I didn't think Piranha 3DD was a complete waste of time, hence a 2 star.<br />-Christopher Lloyd returns as well as the mad scientist further explaining whatever new thing the piranha's are capable of, he's campy and over-the-top as always and was a nice change of character from the dumb kids.<br />-Ving Rhames and Jerry O'Connel's assistant (who still sports the sun-lotion on his nose) also come back in minor roles where they go to the water park on the worst possible day to rehabilitate themselves and get comfortable with being in water again. Ving Rhames was also pretty damn funny, and when he walks into the pool with shotguns for legs it's pure B movie madness, if only the rest of the movie could've been as good as those cameos.<br /><br />The 'Intentional' Stupidity of it all:<br />-First of all, the douchebag cop is the only cop in this whole movie, and he looks like he just went into his junior year of highschool. So when the community discovers the presence of Piranha in their midst one year after the massacre that was the previous Piranha, the only person on the case is the young presumably inexperienced cop, he doesn't alert anyone else, doesn't tell anybody not to swim in the Piranha-infested water, none of that.<br />-Better yet the heroine who KNOWS the water is Piranha-infested decides to jump in anways to \\"check the grates\\".<br />-Then the water park that's trying to re-establish itself with sex appeal has an employee that's about 300lbs who has a face like a pug dog and has hobbies such as jumping in puke and using the water jets to masturbate. Not only is that a bad business move but the guy can't control himself, in the middle of their opening day he's still masturbating with the water jets oblivious to the piranha attacks going on. Who hired this guy again?<br /><br />Inept Directing:<br />-There's a scene where a woman who unknowingly had a baby piranha in her vagina is getting intimate with her boyfriend when the piranha comes out and bites his penis. Now this is something that the director and the audience could've had a lot of fun with, they could've played it as really horrifying and/or really funny, but the scene just sort of happens. The woman passes out with puke spurting out of her mouth for some reason and the guy screams and walks over to the kitchen and severs his penis off with the piranha attached. Then right after that chaos everything is quiet and the girl wakes up somehow, walks around until the boyfriend jump-scares her. That's it? It's like they just read the script and filmed it just like that, no visual flair, no funny or ridiculous lines acted, it's all really just bland and trying too hard to be shocking, with no sense of passion from the filmmaker's part.<br />-Another scene earlier has a couple getting kinky in a van using handcuffs when the van rolls into the lake after a mishap with the parking break, the girl can get out but the boyfriend is stuck in the van with the handcuffs still attached, then when he gets attacked you just see a few close-ups of flesh being bitten and see him reacting poorly. You don't really see any of the attack, all you see is another jump-scare where his bloody stump pops open to surprise the girl who's on top of the van. Also when the car is rolling into the water about 1 minute later it's in the middle of the lake, but cars don't float all the way in the middle of a lake before they start sinking, so this was another instance of plot conveniences trumping logic.<br /><br />The Piranha Attack: The disappointment to end all disappointments, Phantom Menace ain't got s*** on this. The shots that establish the park seem like a bunch of advertisements with naked chicks, going tubing down water slides, swimming in the pools, going tubing, etc. When the piranha eventually attack it's those exact same shots again with CGI Piranha added. There's virtually no build-up to the attack, you see one piranha that acts like a scout swim around for a second than swim back into the broken grates to tell the swarm or something. Somehow a solution that equals 'get out of the pool' is stretched out to like 15 minutes of underwhelming mayhem, showing mostly just the heroes randomly running around with some blood and bodies in the pools behind them in the background. The piranha's themselves just weren't threatening either, multiple times characters jump into piranha-infested waters and 'just narrowly' avoid getting eaten by the 5 or 6 piranha, it never feels like a massive swarm of them like in the first one, speaking of the first piranha...<br /><br />What worked for the first Piranha movie's attack was how the scene's worked together. The piranha's swam up to the partiers, bite the first lady, and chaos ensued in many different fun/gross ways. We go from the floating stage being toppled over, to people climbing frantically on boats, to boats running people over in the chaos, to half eaten people crawling out of the water. Here, it's just people splashing in red water that can't get out of the pool, and none of the creative gore such as a woman's hair getting ripped off is evident here, it's just prosthetic bodies. Weak.<br /><br />However there were a few moments where I was cracking up, David Koeschner trying to escape and running over a little kid was pretty great, and Ving Rhames comparing Piranha to kids whizzing in the pool also got a chuckle out of me. Another thing that was pretty funny was the zooming camera shot when Roy Schieder saw the boy get eaten by the shark in Jaws was used repeatedly whenever David Hasselhoff looked around, and the same dramatic shot comes back everytime Hasselhoff turns around again and looks at the carnage; words can't really do that part justice.<br /><br />Those few good chuckles was about all the entertainment value I got from Piranha 3DD though, it's a bad sign when the cameos are the only good thing going for your movie. Piranha 3DD's actual use of the piranhas was lame and underwhelming and overall I wouldn't recommend Piranha 3DD unless you're really curious/bored.ayed it as really horrifying and/or really funny, but the scene just sort of happens.

B001BNFR6W|3.0|I love the series, always have. I was excited to start watching it on my new (to me) dvd set!<br /><br />Sadly, I have had to miss a few episodes, why you ask? Because the dvds are scratched. So at least one episode on each disk will not let me watch it.<br /><br />Other than that, speedy delivery, and easy seller!
0345803507|5.0|this was the best book i read in a long time.couldnt put it down.very very good.all women should read this
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Although SWCC (Special Warfare Combatant Craft crewmen) has a long history as a job specialty, but organization wise they are pretty new compare to the SEALs, and get less exposures to the public.  This movie, Act of Valor, was the first movie that NSW gave their full cooperation, and some of the dialog and action sequences shows SWCC guys in action.  Well worth a watch.
0345803485|5.0|very good book.i recond it to be read.happy ending. as good as the first and second book.everyone should read these books

0316067601|5.0|Not since WWII have we seen heroes the likes of the US Navy SEAL teams.  This story will grab you from the start as the author makes it through Hell week and then takes you with him on an extremely dangerous SEAL mission into the mountains of Afghanistan where his life will be forever changed.<br /><br />My deepest gratitude to the men and women of the armed services and especially to those who gave their all in service to their country.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this book before I found out that this was self published. I typically bypass those, since they are usually early works of an author and not too great. This is obviously a later work of this author. The plot is thought through well, the characters are molded before your eyes, and the relationships between characters are very believable. Excellent book, excellent author, and I'm looking forward to the Tower Lord.
B0083EW97W|5.0|As I listen to it for the fifth time, I begin to love it even more.  It is entirely relaxing and has such a chill vibe, while each song is different enough to keep me interested.  I love his voice in this album.  I wholeheartedly agree that this is far superior to Battle Studies, but I enjoyed that album as well.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I have heard a lot about One Direction, but I had not heard all of the songs until I ordered their CD. I love all of them.  It is an upbeat album that just makes you want to sing and dance.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a good game.I think it's a good game:) I like it I play with it every day it's asome
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the best I use to play it on my moms phone but now I can play it on my kindle yay!!! love it!
B0083GQKQG|1.0|This movie was absolutely horrible!  I cannot believe a group of people put this awful stuff on film!  The mother gives birth to this disgusting, disrespectful child and nobody chooses to smack the crap out of him.  He then goes onto abusing his younger sister.  Finally, he does away with his high school class via locking them in the gym and shooting them with arrows.  All the while,  the mother aspires to get his love.  Sick, sick, sick!  Disgusting script, horribly movie.  Do not make another.  Nothing is artsy about this, you twisted pos who made it.
0345803485|1.0|I don't even know where to begin with this one. It is beyond horrible on so many levels. While BDSM isn't personally my kink, I get it. I have good friends in the lifestyle and I think I have a pretty good understanding what goes into a functional dom/sub relationship. While this book sets up the pretense of having that relationship, I don't think it is an accurate depiction at all. I have read decent BDSM erotica, and this isn't it. For everyone who thought Stephenie Meyer set feminism back 100 years with Twilight, this Twilight fanfic dreck is doing far, far worse. Everything about this story makes me ill. Christian is the most repugnant character I think I have ever encountered. He is not sexy, he's sick. He made my skin crawl. Another reviewer, or perhaps it was a comment on a review, said that it was not Christian in the bedroom (or rather, the Red Room) that was the problem. It was Christian everywhere else that was the problem. She hit the nail on the head there, I can't say it better than that. Everything about his actions screams abuser. If people thought Edward Cullen was a creepy, controlling stalker, Christian Grey is 1000 times worse.  This is a man who gets what he wants, and hang the contract, I don't believe for a second someone with this personality type realistically would abide by any contract if Ana wanted to leave. Oh no, he had her on the hook for far too much. I think one of the first real clinchers was taking her car and providing her one of his choosing and on his dollar, then he really had her trapped. Trapping the victim financially is a common move for abusers.<br />This story seems like it exists for every stupid girl who falls for the abusive a**hole because she's totally going to change him. It doesn't work like that in real life and this book's popularity is actually inciting a visceral terror in me because of what it implies for society if people think this is hot.<br />I haven't even gotten to the point of just how terribly writtenthis book is, but I'm running out of energy.<br />I would like to add that I liked Kate and Elliot, but unsurprisingly, Rosalie and Emmett were my favorite Twilight characters-because Rosalie/Kate has a both a brain and a spine and Elliot/Emmett were adorable goofs who actually respect their lady. What a concept. Can more romance writers explore that, please?
B0083SBJXS|3.0|I enjoyed The Avengers, mostly. It was nice to see all of the Marvel characters get their due onscreen, and only Hawkeye felt short-shrifted by the plot (he's the only one we really know nothing about heading into the film, and we don't actually get \\"him\\" as a character until the third act). A lot could (and probably should) have gone wrong putting all these larger than life superheroes into one movie, but it is to the credit of writer/director Joss Whedon that, for the most part, the film holds together quite well.<br /><br />That being said, taken on its own, this is a good film, not a great one. With so many characters to re-introduce and have share in the spotlight, there is no true protagonist who's arc we follow. As a result, with the exception of some really good set pieces, the first two thirds of the film can tend to drag. And the final battle, while well-choreographed and filled with really smart, funny moments (Hulk truly shines in this third act) goes on for too long, and has no rise in tension from the start to the finish. The villains in the movie are complete pushovers, and the endless armada that attacks Manhattan is comprised of the same disposable foot soldiers ad nauseum, with none of them posing any kind of threat to any of our heroes. Loki himself was defeated in Thor by the God of Thunder solo, so now with Cap, Hulk, Tony Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. also arrayed against him, it's no surprise that we never worry about the outcome.<br /><br />The whole film in essence feels like a re-introduction to all the characters we've already established in the previous movies, which, obviously, was necessary, and because there's so much set-up involved it's understandable that the plot would be extremely bare-bones and generic so that focus is given to these characters. Joss Whedon is an expert storyteller, and he leaps the hurdles that this project came entrenched with deftly. Honestly, no one could do a better job with the material than the man who turned $39million and demand from a small rabid fanbase into the best sci-fi film since Aliens (Serenity, go watch it now if you haven't already). The stage is set for an explosively fun Avengers 2.<br /><br />So I expect to get a fair amount of slams for not gushing more over the movie. I did enjoy it (on second viewing I enjoyed it slightly more than the first time) but this is not a film that I, as a big super-hero/fantasy/sci-fi fan, am ever going to go ga-ga over. I think it did what it needed to do, which was effectively set up the franchise that is to follow, and do so with humor and heart. As the prologue to what is to follow, I think it's top notch. As a standalone film, I think it comes in several ticks below the Nolan Batman flicks (that have their own issues) and the Donner Superman films. However, this is sooo much better than any of the recent X-Men or Fantastic Four movies that it shouldn't even be mentioned along side those lame-duck series.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Avengers movie, and hope that Joss Whedon is still at the helm when it comes.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The book was fast moving, exciting and well written. The story line was great and the setting of the story was fun to \\"be in\\"!<br />I liked the development of the characters, as I have read the previous two other books. It was page turning at the end. Great ending by the way.

B00881VLCE|1.0|on my kindle fire the pieces are hard or unable to be moved.  I would have absolutely LOVED it otherwise. And there are a lot of free ones if you click the cart and scroll down there's a whole free section. PLEASE fix for kindle

0525425764|4.0|John Grisham's third Theodore Boone story finds the clever eighth grader attending a trial for a man accused of killing his wife. Theodore gets the last seat at the media-filled event only to learn that the suspect has run away. He marvels that someone could spend his life on the run.<br /><br />On the day of the trial, Theo discovers that his locker has been burglarized, with inhalers, a Twins baseball cap and some notebooks stolen, and later finds his bike tire slashed. After boy scouts the next day, his tire is slashed again. Theo suspects the vandal is another student, but can't think of anyone who hates him that much. He carries his bike to his parents' law offices only to find them in the middle of a big argument among his mothers' divorce clients. He has to leave to go tutor kids at the homeless shelter, so there's no time to tell his parents what has been happening.<br /><br />That night, a computer store is robbed; several expensive laptops, smart phones and more are stolen. At school the following day, Theo is called into the office and asked about the robbery. The detectives search his locker and find two laptops. Theo knows they were not in there that morning and that he did not rob the store. The detectives had received an anonymous tip, though, that Theo was the thief.<br /><br />A photo of Theo and his parents leaving the police station after questioning is sent over the Internet, and soon everyone knows he is accused of the crime. A rock is thrown through the window of his workroom at the law offices, and Theo wants to run away. When his parents make him return to school, he gets in a fight after being taunted and ends up on suspension.<br /><br />The suspension gives Theo time to try and figure out who is targeting him, with the help of his uncle Ike, who likes to bend legal rules to learn information. Through Ike, Theo finds out that he and another family member are actually the targets, and soon the investigation heats up. The police then search the Boone home and make it clear that Theo is their only suspect. Theo's tire is slashed again, and he has to draw on his friends' help and networking to discover who is behind all the attacks.<br /><br />While trying to prove the authorities wrong, Theo has to help with another case in animal court, involving a spitting llama. There is plenty of humor like that in between the attacks on Theo to keep the story moving.<br /><br />THEODORE BOONE: THE ACCUSED is a fast-paced novel with a likable, smart hero and a mystery that is all-too realistic. Those new to the series will be able to follow along even if they have not read the previous two adventures, but it's likely that readers will want to delve into the entire series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Amy Alessio on June 1, 2012he Boone home and make it clear that Theo is their only suspect.

B0071CNGI8|5.0|This was my first purchase of a book on my kindle. Very easy to do!!! Also a great book to purchase for your kindle! A must read before going to the movie to watch it!!!
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|The CD is OK, not as great as I hoped.  Like most people, I was attracted to the album from his big hit, Somebody That I Used to Know.  I actually prefer all the remixes that are out now vs. the record cut of that song which is much slower and not as exciting (by the way, I heard he is releasing a CD soon of just the remixes so maybe you can keep an eye out for that) and although I am always open to new music, the other songs didn't wow me, either.  I can say maybe I like 2 other songs on the album, the rest are pretty random and display different styles of music that I am not into, like I said, it's not what I expected.  If you are a huge fan, I would say get it, otherwise, maybe take a listen to it first online to make sure this one is for you, you may just want the single.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Great movie; I don't know why some reviewers are being harsh.  Is the plot a bit predictable?  Yes...almost.  If you're a Liam fan and a fan of good acting, great film scenery and tension...I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great program! Commentaries and such would be good, but for what it does. I have not tried all of its capabilities yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is A very fun game if your board or craving a fun game... it combines adrenalin with fun and sharp eyes. I recommend it for all ages... it's surprising that it's free.
0762445262|1.0|cheap plastic flashlight with the bat symbol on the lens, only suitable for a miniaturized cityscape, this \\"spotlight\\" is less than 2\\" and requires watch batteries - the \\"hardcover\\" history book is something you would see in a diaper bag, if the baby had 3rd grade level reading skills - total ripoff at this price
B00884GR0W|3.0|I really want to like this game more but ... I don't think I was supposed to glitch through the floor and I cant figure out how to craft anything ... its got potential it really does .. cant wait for a update :)
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This is a dragged out story that seems to be taking forever to get to the original purpose of the book - the assassination of President Kennedy.  There are many subplots involved and I am not being drawn back to it as easily as I would another more interesting and fast-moving book.  As a matter of fact, if I hadn't paid to purchase the book rather than borrowing it from a library, I probably would have returned it unfinished.
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever in the history. of kindle. games epic epic epic epic epical Ethan. jiggered. hygiene Noll grip unless. Okinawa. gnarly tog. totally well done thumbs up:) ;)

B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run was one of those &quot;mainstream&quot; apps that I thought, well its free... so why not? and later that day I realized that I really wanted to beat some challenges and then I wanted to get more powerups so I played more! its a lot of fun, just go for it!
B000001GBJ|5.0|This CD contains no vocals which is just what I was looking for.  The mucic is magical.  Magical is the only way to describe this music.  I have several of the Secret Garden CDs and this one is by far the best.  You will not be disappointed if you are looking for soulful, magicical music that carries you off to a a better place.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally ive been waiting for Temple Run to come for Kindle Fire I am so happy this is a awesome app ya'll  should get it

0545265355|5.0|i haven't read these books- but see them advertised everywhere! I wonder if they're good or just another fad? I never have patience for the type of books that come in and out- I like real classics.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger game trilogy is the best I've read in years. It a love store in the future that has all kinds of twists and turns. I just wish their was more .
B0086700CM|3.0|i love this app but it has some issues<br />1. its version is 1.0.4<br />2. its low version makes no cheats work
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book really makes you think. It show mans inhumanity to man. It also shows how one person can make a difference. In a way this is an alternate version if Nazi Germany. Know history so you don't let it repeat itself.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I use it as a stress release in the evening and it helps me to relax.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Worst trilogy ever.  Obviously both the writer & publisher only cared more about how much money they could make than about putting out a quality product.  Do not get me wrong, it did not go into this expecting Shakespeare or Dickens, but I was hoping it was going to be more than the pile of crap that it is.  It is obvious to me that the author had 2 or 3 paragraph templates saved, because she kept using the same ones over and over and over again until I wanted to puke.  This story may have been bearable if they kept in to one book, because honestly that is all you need to tell this totally unbelievable tale.  I am all for a good fantasy story.  I love a little light reading, chick lit or silly romance for sitting by the pool in the summer, but this was just painful.  I got excited for a mere second during book one when he opened the door to the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" - I thought we were going to get something different and interesting. Alas, no.  Same old boring crap about damaged, gorgeous, rich man finding love in a whining, pathetic, spineless, insecure virgin. All I honestly kept thinking about the entire time is that there must seriously be a lot of repressed people out there if they think this is hot and steamy. Are we really suppose to feel something for these people?  I should have trusted me instincts and stayed away.  Out 30 bucks and worse yet, out the time I spent reading this crap.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|great words to live by. I cant put it Down. truly surprised on being able to read different versions of bibles, languages and audible verses.
0321701763|5.0|Very good tutorial, with the included photos. A must have. Anyone who has Photoshop CS5 should own a copy. It takes you through quite comprehensively of what CS5 can do, and the presentation is clear and precise.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not all the hype.  Yes, I purchased all 3, so I could have the complete story.  I read them in about 7 or 8 days. I loved the covers. The twist and plots made the story, not really the sex or erotic play.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for who knows how long for Amazon to get this app. My friend has this app and I was disappointed when Amazon didn't have this app. I am so excited. This is my favorote app ever!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic show - love the time period and the acting is great. PBS shows are awesome - definitely recommend watching the Downton Abbey series.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Nothing more to say than, this was the best show on TV ever. I love just about every episode, and they never get old. Very good acting by all members of the cast. Too bad there wasn't a \\"final\\" episode before ending their run. Maybe we'll see a reunion one day... wishfull thinking maybe.

159102594X|5.0|I was looking for something similar to ASoIaF and this book comes close than anything I have read so far. I am now a devout Joe Abercrombie fan.
0439023513|4.0|I choose to tread this book because I had read the first two in the trilogy. Overall the book was good, but the end was disappointing. This last book about katniss' story, the rebellion and the future of panem is a new journey for katniss and the reader. The theme of rebellion is throughout the whole book. Rebellion is natural to the human race, our history since the very beginning is filled with battle, war, and fighting. It will continue until the end of time.<br /><br />After the bombing in district 8 as katniss is being filmed for a propo, she paints the planes burning on the roof of a warehouse, the capital on a wing glows clearly through the flames and says \\"Fire is catching! And if we burn, you burn with us!(100) This could not have been more true. Not only in the end is the capital destroyed but also are the districts, the rebels and the people of panem. The rebels fight against the capital was not won without loss. From the first book to the third, the mockingjay is symbolic of the rebellion. It starts with Madge, the daughter of district 12's major, giving katniss her mockingjay pin as she says goodbye before katniss goes to the hunger games. Katniss holds up the nightlock berries with peeta, ready to take her own life she triggers the rebellion. In the third nook she becomes the Mockingjay, the face of the rebellion. I think the author chooses this term because of its connection to katniss' past. As a child, her father and her would venture into the woods beyond district 12. Her father would sing and the mockingjays would mimic his voice. Using the term mockingjay reminds the reader and katniss of her father. It is a way to keep his character, memory and spirit alive for both katniss and us. I disagree with how the author ended the book. Like many other people, I thought the ending was rushed. All of collins' books are cliff hangers and leave us wanting to know more. Mockingjay is no different, except it is the last book in the trilogy and there is no more. \\"Mockingjay relentlessly strips aside those feelings of faith and hope...\\" I think the author does this so we feel like Katniss \\"shattered, empty and drained.\\" It is a way for the reader to identify with her and be drawn into the story. A clear conclusion would make it easier to except the end. As humans we want to know, we need to know. Leaving it up to our own imaginations allows us to think of all the possibilities, the good and the bad.<br /><br />Katniss is a tragic hero from the beginning.I recommend reading this book. Reading the first two books in the trilogy makes the third book more understandable and less confusing.<br /><br />TJHS 12th grade studente. \\"Mockingjay relentlessly strips aside those feelings of faith and hope...\\" I think the author does this so we feel like Katniss \\"shattered, empty and drained.\\" It is a way for the reader to identify with her and be drawn into the story.

B007KZY1YY|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades of Grey you will definitely enjoy Fifty Shades Darker!<br /><br />When I finished Fifty Shades of Grey I had to read Fifty Shades Darker. Fifty Shades of Grey ends with conflict and I couldn't handle the suspense of waiting, so pounced on the next installment of the trilogy.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades Darker a few people from Christian's past appear to cause some trouble, you learn more about why he is the way he is. Ana has a creepy boss. She stands up to Christian some more. I adore how strong she is as she tries to change Christian from a dominant to an equal.<br /><br />There's some sex (of course!). Some action. Some romance. A mysterious ending.<br /><br />It's an all round good read!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i've been reading the same authors over and over again and needed something different. i was a little worried that reading a book like this was taboo, but everyone's reading it so i gave in to my temptation.<br />i'm so glad that i read it...it opened my eyes to a whole new world of sex that i never knew existed. not that i want to try all of the things in the book, but it definitely gave me a few ideas on how to spice things up :)<br />i did not like the ending, but i guess that's what books two and three are for...can't wait to read fifty shades darker which i just uploaded on the kindle!!!!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed is the best book in the trilogy. If you enjoyed the other two you will absolutely adore it!<br /><br />Love the insert at the end. I think it's great seeing situations from multiple points of view, and including the little snippet from the first book in Christians point of view made me feel nostalgic, I had to go back and read the trilogy again!<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed has Ana and Christian settling into their relationship and their futures together.<br /><br />The trilogy is so touching, you hang off every word, I'm going to struggle to find a romance that will compare.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The book starts off a little slow (as most stories do) but it ends up being one of the most captivating and well written books I've ever read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a review for the Hunger games trilogy, not just for Mockinjay. I postponed reading these books even though the whole world around me read them by now and tried to convince me to read it. Topic of the children killing each other to death may upset me, but finally I decided that I have to try and see what everybody loved so much. Susan Collins is a superb writer. I finished the first two books in two days, her dystopian society that created the monstrocity called Hunger games was nevertheless populated by the characters which did not only jump off the pages but I think I wont be able to forget them all for the years to come. I was a little worried to start third book, what with all the opinions about it being depressing and all that, not fulfilling people's expectations. I should have trusted the writer more, god I should have trusted her more. As far as I am concerned the first two books could not have ended any other way than what is happening in the third book. As far as I am concerned Katniss Everdeen was just as heroic and brave in the third book as she was in the other two. No, I was not upset that I did not see the rebellion as a big picture. This is Katniss' story - of course I expected to see only what she would see. I did not think she was out of character, I thought everything that happened in book three was perfectly foreshadowed in other two books. I am very happy and satisfied by the ending. But yeah, it was depressing and gruesome and painful. Good books about wars usually are all that judging by my reading experience.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Not much to say about this one...we all know UNO! Like any electronic card game you never really know when the computer has decided its going to beat you no matter what you do. Like when you only have once card left for 15 rounds and the computer somehow still wins but oh well they are all like that. It is entertaining and helps time pass when I'm bored. I wish it had a friends option to play with other people instead of just computers. Cheap good fun.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is very good. it didn't install the first time I tried it but the second time it installed perfectly. I play it a lot but it takes up a lot of memory which is the only bad thing. there are no glitches in the start menu for me. the graphics are good too. overall this is a good game. I would recommend it to people who likes blood!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I got this game while I was sitting at an airport waiting for a plane to kill time. After only a few minutes I became so obsessed with it I seriously considered cancelling my flight. Ok, ok not that far but it is great. I love mind, puzzle games and if you do too this is it. Lots of levels so worth the 99 cents. I still havent beat them all.
B0086700CM|5.0|the sweetest funnest wickedest game ever and you can never quit playing because you get so into it you can sit there for hours playing this game
B0066W1AZK|1.0|I downloaded this app because it said you could play and interact with other people not just computer player. Well after days of waiting for one single person to join player mode I gave up and deleted the app. Im sure its great if you want to play a computer, but not what I was looking for.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved it because all my friends had it but my kindle didn't I'm so happy they put it on my kindlefire.
B003XQPT9A|5.0|I watch this movie year round when I'm looking for a pick-me-up.  Makes me feel good and improves my attitude about my fellow man.  The music is memorable, the lyrics poignant, and the overall mood gives me a  refreshing lift. (With enough wit to make me feel like an adult.)
B005VSRFEA|5.0|I was new to her writings, but had an interest in systems dynamics from an organizational behavior standpoint, so this was a great primer! I would recommend this to any graduate student, upper-level undergraduate, or post-graduate student interested in learning more about systems thinking.  I also learned more about her, may she rest in peace, and the group that started the mainstream push for systems thinking.  Great read and I highly recommend!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple tun is so much fun......iv been waiting foor it sence the begining of the year and now i  constantly play it and everyone should get the game plus its free
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book obviously was interesting, but it took a couple of chapters to get into. The quality of the writing was poor. The writing was really repetitive and predictable. I do not recommend this book to anyone unless you are bored in life and need some spice! Then, in all seriousness, it would be good for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever and totally addictive. love it so much. get this app. If you don't get it your totally missing out.
0066620996|1.0|WHOOPS. Check out this quote from the book: \\"Fannie Mae grasped the subtle denominator of profit per mortgage *risk level*, not per mortgage (which would be the \\"obvious\\" choice). It's a brilliant insight. The real driver in Fannie Mae's economics is the ability to understand risk of default in a package of mortgages better than anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing the spread on that risk. Simple, insightful, unobvious--and right.\\"<br /><br />Oh except that it wasn't right. It was dead wrong. Fannie's \\"brilliant insight\\" represents the rampant irresponsibility that caused the financial crisis and literally broke the entire economy.<br /><br />So much for \\"good\\" to \\"great\\". How can you believe a book whose analysis was so apocalyptically wrong.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is extremely entertaining and addicting, and although the animation needs only a slight improvement, it is overall very well done
B00881VLCE|5.0|It is so fun my cuzin sed it was fun and he is only 4 and I just bot this game!

B005USZYDU|1.0|I enjoyed the book.  Theodore was an atypical bright young man who has a desire to help others.  An interesting, entertaining read.
0345803507|5.0|Althought the second book was my favorite out of the trilology , Fifty Shades Freed, was a wonderful ending to my favorite books series.  It totally engrossed me, and I could not put it down.  Christian Grey...ahhhhhh !!!<br />I will say that I was disappointed in his reaction to Ana's \\"big news\\"....but then he made my heart melt as always when he came around, as I knew he would ;)<br />This is my far my favorite of anything that I've read....and I am looking forward to the \\"Shades of Christian\\" as it's in the back of Freed....I hope she releases it, i'm having Christian withdrawls !!!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say, but that this is a great album capturing Adele at her best. Amazon's price is excellent for this album, better than I could reasonably expect from a local establishment.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting.  I had it on my iPod I dropped; so I got a kindle and the larger screen makes it so much more fun.
0345529057|4.0|I have read all four of these books because I just LOVE the show on HBO. The show is moving right along the story lines in the book. From True Blood, I know that this is not always the case. But Game of Thrones was different. It only varies for story line purposes; ways to keep the show moving along. There is soooo much more detail in the book that i'm glad I got it. I have even recently purchased the 5th book in the series: A Dance With Dragons.<br />That is the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. Because of the fourth book. It's informational, giving you story lines on people behind the scenes, and what is causing this thing and that thing. I really wanted to konw what was happening to my favorite characters so I bought the 5th. Not disappointed.<br /><br />Excellent!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is such a cool game. works great on my kindle fire. graphics are great...I could play this for hours!.  I like the fact it is unique and different from what's out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun. everyone should get this super fun game. get it get it get it get it
B0086700CM|4.0|I think it is awesome and fun. I wouldn't get the game if you don't have fast reflexes, but if you do there is plenty of dogeing and jumping. plus the graphics are great
0345529057|5.0|The books are awesome, ans definitely worth the price. The only thing I would say is that they are large books, and they will suck you in, so it's a bit tough to get comfortable with them for the prolonged periods you will be reading. If this is offputting, I would say get a kindle version or e-book
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love this game. It's very fun and cool along with the puss in boots theme makeover of fruit ninja. very addictive
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|IT WONT LET ME CREATE AN ACCOUNT! Its just always stuck on creating an account! btw it should be less comfusing!
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever for the kindle fire. WoW I can't believe its finally available for the kindle fire. so ADDICTIVE and fun. I absolutely LOVE it!!!!!!
B005LAII0I|5.0|I saw this movie twice in theatres and it was awesome! Great script, great actors, really funny, great directing. The song at the end was good but it seemed more bollywood and didn't really fit the movie. Great movie overall, and that's coming from someone who is not a big fan of the snow white tale. I really loved this movie and so did my entire family. I would definately recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love it! it is so fun! this is great game for anybody! better than most of the games out there rifght now. I'm addicted!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very fun game.. its easy to advance in and keeps ur interest... the longer you play it the more bonuses you receive.. the more decorations u have the more bonuses you have... great game love it!
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Movie is okay. To pass the time if your board it is worth watching. I'm glad I did not pay to see it at theaters, I would give it a solid C grade.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|I liked this very much and was surprised to see \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" in it and how great he is. He has made me a fan. The story had a \\"1984\\" ending and it makes you think what can happen in the world of \\"Big Brother\\". It is sort of scary if you want to think about it, but I am not surprised if we are almost there.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It may be an \\"age thing,\\" but I did not find this to be a great book...I cannot imagine anyone loving the brutality in the sex scenes.  Anastasia was an experienced, stupid girl.  Christian should have been an older man. This was one trashy book in my eyes.  I realize we all have different opinions, and I know people who loved this book, but I'm just saying....
B000M341RI|5.0|What can I say about \\"The Full Monty\\"? It should be a 10 star rating! The Full Monty Fully Exposed is misleading. To begin with it implys there is something different to see than in the first one The full Monty but the thing that I do like about it is you are able to use subtitles and you see the \\"making of\\" which I really like on a dvd. So, I have both versions and love them both.I like the fact that you get to know the story on why these men wanted to do this and how funny everything is and sweet too. The son in the film is really good. And needless to say Gaz is really a good father in it and the rest of the actors and actresses are perfect fit. Can you tell I was impressed?
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun and easy to use :)  I love it. absolutely not a thing wrong with it and id even pay a dollar for it if I had to!!!!! best app ever.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I saw the recent 8 episodes on t.v. and decided to buy the first 5 episodes and then I was able to get the first season and have not received it yet, but what I have seen is very interesting. I like the way they go from the book to the present with the characters. I am looking forward to seeing the whole thing. Hopefully there will be more of it.

B00881VLCE|3.0|the game works good on &quot;fire&quot; except for that top piece. very frustrating when you're almost done and you can not move that last peice. other than that graphics are pretty good. alot of puzzles to choose from and there are free puzzles as well.
B005OP71GC|5.0|I had not seen the series and therefore got in on it late in the game. Very glad I bought the Pilot episode. This is an excellent story and the download was perfect.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a fun app. Beautiful pictures and a really great array of puzzles to choose from. Lots of free puzzles. Works amazing on my Fire.
B006RUJST6|5.0|There are a lot of books out there with 5 ratings but this one really deserves it. It pulled me in from the beginning and I never knew what was coming. The writing was really well done. There were so many elements that touched me. The poetry, the romance, the heartache. I enjoyed it so much.
0316098329|3.0|I picked up \\"Room\\" because I remembered hearing so many rave reviews and didn't think I could pass it up. I don't usually (ok, never) pay full price, but wanted to treat myself to this one because I figured it would be worth it. I should have saved my money. Let me explain. The concept of Room to me is fantastic. (SPOILER ALERT) A 5 year old boy, Jack, and his \\"Ma\\" are trapped in an 11×11 room, held captive by the man who kidnapped Ma years ago. Jack is the product of the multiple rapes that have taken place and their life is fully contained in Room. Jack knows no different and Ma tries her best to give him the most normal life she can by limiting his tv watching, making sure he does basic hygiene (as Ma's teeth have rotted), teaching lesson, music, etc...<br /><br />All this was fine with me. I didn't even mind the story being told by Jack as I felt it was a nice change. The first half of the book flowed nicely and I could picture the life that these two had together in Room (even Old Nick was easy to visualize). But, the story began to lose me as Ma began to try to figure out a way to escape. This is where i felt the writing seemed pushed and not as well thought out as it previously was. And unfortunately for me, this was the beginning of the end of my love for Room.<br /><br />Is is an awful book? Not at all. Do I think it deserves all the rave reviews? Not for me, but to each their own. I won't go into more details as I don't want to give away the whole story but it is a book that is bound to bring up all sorts of discussion.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite app next to draw something. I have waited so long for it on kindle fire! I kind of hate the lagging but I love it so much that I still give it five stars.  it is so addicting!

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Once again, in season two (2) of this series of \\"Sherlock\\", I was completely in awe of how wonderfully directed, written and, most of all, acted this series is.  My god the three (3) one hour and a half episodes plus a \\"behind the scenes\\" special feature on two (2) discs are simply thrilling and gripping--I was on the \\"edge of my seat\\"  at all times.  I look forward to Season three (3).    The acting by all in this series is stupendous.  As an extremely fast talking Sherlock (thoughts racing far ahead of the physical ability to speak), Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant.   As is the shadowy Andrew Scott as Sherlock's nemesis Murioty--his little dance sequence when he's obtained access to the \\"crown jewels\\" is fabulous.    Murioty in Season two (2) ingeniously brings down Sherlock in the most wonderful last episode in Season two (2)--or does he?
0345803485|5.0|this is a hot book without being dirty but I dont think they can make a movie out of it. it would be XXXXXXXX

B007PS0X0W|2.0|I can't believe I heard this was good.  The characters were extremely flat and dull, aside from the super werewolf who gets maybe 5 minutes of screen time.  Also the cop played by michael ealy, who is a great actor, was interesting at first, but quickly decides to be a from vampire supporter, killing his own kind in a mere instant.  My least favorite part was the little girl.  Talk about a dull whiny little kid---the same as any scared little kid you'd see in a movie.  The only thing that gets this two stars is that the effects were good and there were some cool action sequences, however this is nothing special any more, and the sciences were not even all that memorable.  A very big letdown compared to the characters and acting in rise of the lycans
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wish I could give this trilogy eight stars. This is definetly in my top 5 books that I've ever read in my 12 year life. Lets talk about the first one for a second, shall we? In my opinion, the first one is the best one out of the trilogy, point blank. It has everything I look for in a book, action, romance, and love and lost. It ahs action because of all the killing and fighting that goes on while their in the arena. Romance, this book is filled with romance. Whether it's-BIG TIME SPOILER- Katniss and Peeta not wanting to kill each other when they realize both cannot survive, or Katniss and Gale, which are obviously in love. Well Katniss is just indenial so, she refueses to accept that. I abso;utely love this book, if you don't want to buy the whole trilogy yet, fine just make sure you buy this one. On to \\"Catching Fire,\\" the secoond one in the trilogy. This was also a great book. Once again romance and action, Katniss+Peeta, or Katniss+Gale, but I have an instinct that it will never happen between those two, (Katniss and Gale). So in this one,-SPOILER ALERT-Katniss and Peeta won the Hunger Games against all odds. They should one of the happiest people on Earth. They broke the Capitol's rules, so now, the Capitol wants....revenge. The last installment of this amazing trilogy is, \\"Mockingjay.\\" She has survived the Hunger Games twice, without even knowing she was ment to survive it the second time. The apitol is furious with Katniss, and is now punishing everyone she cares and loves oh so much about. No one is safe from the horrible torture President Snowis making happen. The only person who can save everyone is, Katniss. To save everyone, she MUST be the Mockingjay.<br /><br />I'm telling you, you must read this fantastic trilogy of \\"The Hunger Games.\\" You will never be able to, even if you want to, forget \\"The Hunger Games.\\" One of the best trilogies of all time.
B004LL1HMY|5.0|After two or three listens, I knew. This is one of the most enjoyable albums I have heard in a long time. Fresh, fun, finally. Fleet Foxes.
B000Y8GFY8|5.0|Goldfrapp's \\"Seventh Tree\\" is a departure from anything you have ever heard from them in the past. In fact, I think this album would have been more appropriate to call \\"Supernature\\" than \\"Supernature\\" itself, because this album conveys itself in a very natural and fresh manner. To break this one down track-by-track:<br />1. Clowns: It's amazing that I would find a song so beautiful contains the line, \\"titties that go on and on...\\" and yet, the song is overwhelmingly tranquil. The lyrics initially puzzled me very much. Did she really write such a beautiful song about...tits? I think the answer is yes, but I am sure that was part of the appeal and intent. This song can be analyzed in so many ways, but I'll save that for someone else. This is a fantastic intro to the album because it really does set this mellow, laid-back tone for the rest of the tracks to follow. 10/10<br /><br />2. Little Bird: Not sure what to think of this track. It's really ambiguous and ultimately I don't know what's going on or how to feel after the song ends. It just feels all discombobulated. It's my least favorite on the whole album, but it's still a good song. 6/10<br /><br />3. Happiness: Now momentum is finally picking up in \\"Happiness\\", and may be the most uptempo song on the album. It's a cute little song that seems to be about cults. The lyrics are actually quite dark, and shine a light on the tricks and manipulation groups will use to gain something (money, power, etc.) knowing the person the are preying on is weak or naive. I really enjoyed this song, it's catchy! 9/10<br /><br />4. Road to Somewhere: First couple seconds sound like a slowed-down version of A&E. This is a song where minimalism works really well. Every single sound plays an important or necessary part. It gives you this \\"floating\\" feeling too. The chorus is the highlight of the track, especially for Alison's beautiful vocals. 9/10<br /><br />5. Eat Yourself: Almost reminds me of an early Jewel track, in particular, \\"You Were Meant for Me\\". Again, like Clowns, it contains some bizarre lyrics (\\"If you don't eat yourself, you will explode instead\\"). Still, I think this song is one of the best on the album. It's one of those songs that will put you to sleep when you are too troubled to sleep. It lays down your troubles and puts them to rest. Absolutely lovely and one of my favorites. 10/10<br /><br />6. Some People: It may be at this point you get tired of the slow pace of the album. This is kind of like a slowed-down version of \\"Happiness\\", both the arrangement and lyrics. Except in this song, the protagonist either realizes the ill intent of these bad people, or she/he shrugs it off. I feel like this is auto-biographical in some aspects. I think it was a poor decision to put this track here, after so many slow songs, because it makes it feel like it's dragging. Putting this early in the album would've been smarter. It's a good song, nonetheless. 7/10<br /><br />7. A&E: Again, things start to pick up a little with A&E. This song breaks my heart a little, and is a prime example of Goldfrapp's amazing lyrics. It's the most commercial song on the album, yet they didn't sacrifice substance for a hit. The pace is perfect and the organic arrangement is immediately addicting. 10/10<br /><br />8. Cologne Cerrone Houdini: Alison's vocals, as well as the arrangement, are downright seductive. Lyrics are simple, yet they stick in my head (\\"I'm not your kind; I'm not your girl; See I'm in your car; But not your life\\"). Oddly enough, I listened to this while I was driving, it seemed like she was saying that specific line directly to me! This track is a stand-out, and if you're hesitant to listening to this album, it should be the first or second track you listen to. 10/10<br /><br />9. Caravan Girl: The album's most uptempo song. It's a good song, but I don't have much to say about this song. I think people who enjoyed Supernature/Black Cherry will enjoy this, because it's like the standout tracks on those album, except it's less synth, and more piano/guitar/choir. 9/10<br /><br />10. Monster Love: A good song to tie the album altogether and conclude it. I think the lyrics sum this up quite well: \\"Everything comes around, bringing us back again, here is where we start, and where we end\\". You could almost take this as an answer to the question why they took such a drastically different direction for Seventh Tree after Black Cherry and Supernature. 8/10<br /><br />I am thrilled with the approach they took on this album. How many mainstream bands would do what Goldfrapp did? Overall, the album is beautiful, and equally as impressive as it is expressive. Allison's vocals are the highlight of the album, they fit this laid-back, nature-like music so well! I highly recommend buying the Deluxe edition, it's beautifully packaged and the poster, postcards, and notebook contained are all very stylish and elegantly constructed.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|I'm a big fan of this movie.  I want to point out, however, that I also gave Cheever's collected stories four out of five although that may be one of the best collected stories in U.S. history.  This movie won't change your life.  It's just got some great acting, decent writing and an interesting cast for one movie.<br /><br />Basically, anyone who likes Celine will dig it.  If you're a Vonnegut fan you'll probably like it.  Or even, a rare exception with the V.S Naipaul bit.  Not many movies like it, though.  Pretty cut and dry plot... but more often than not, the thing that a critic may call \\"simple\\" in terms of structure allows freedom in input.  Let's not forget William Kennedy's Iron weed... Strictly speaking, the plot is bare bones, almost juvenile.  But the book itself.  Well, it is life changing, honest, caring.<br /><br />This movie is the same way.  Hope you enjoy it if you watch it.  I didn't promise academy awards.  I promised something heartfelt.
B006ZZAMWK|3.0|First, let me start off by admitting I avoid all boy bands. Someone recommended I listen to this, and against my initial hesitance, I did. I was pleasantly surprised though. I was surprised listening to this how commercial every single song is. This is good and bad: good because nearly any song could be a hit, in my opinion. The production on all tracks is fantastic and the songs are all listenable. The vocals are also good. However, the downside, like with nearly every boy band, is that there is no diversity whatsoever. After awhile, they all seem to sound the same to me and I mix up some of the tracks. The lyrics could have been written by Paris Hilton......'s pet Chihuahua she carries in her purse. Yes, they're THAT bad. It's just too manufactured for the more sophisticated audience.<br /><br />The bottom line is this: buy the album if you want to listen to good pop/mainstream music. It's not bad music. However, if you are looking for something with substance, by all means, avoid this album. This album is for easy, fun listening and clearly aimed at the younger generation.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An intriguing story, written like a testimony to an audience who never geets a chance to be there or do that, but wwho understands the mission some are called to perform.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|Alright, I'm going to keep this review as short and sweet as possible.<br /><br />The Fantastic:<br /><br />The environments that have been re-imagined are absolutely gorgeous, in fact, I would go so far as to say they top that of Alice in Wonderland and nearly rival Avatar.<br /><br />Performances by Theron, Hemsworth, and just about every supporting actor are superb. Believable characters who, at some points, you can relate to on a very personal level.<br /><br />Action sequences are fairly well played out, although in a couple of areas you have a severe 'are you kidding me' moment, like when Snow White rouses the Duke's troops to storm the queen's castle, then refuses to call them back despite the fact that they're locked out and being slain while waiting on the dwarves to raise the gate. Never let a princes lead a tactical military advance, right?<br /><br />The imagery is very dark and in some places relatively creepy, some memorable moments are Snow White's initial journey into the Dark Forest and the Queen's knack for sucking the youth out of other people.<br /><br />The poor:<br /><br />Kristin Stewart. I'm sorry, but she's not an actress. I have no idea who in Hollywood thought she was a profitable individual, but her acting in general, and especially in this movie, are sub-par (ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hemsworth and Theron). That aside, I personally feel she wasn't even a proper cast for Snow White. I don't find her particularly attractive and her features don't compliment the character's very well. Half-way through the movie, I was so tired of seeing her I wanted to leave, save for the hope that her screen-time would become limited.<br /><br />I understand that the character was to be one who has been alienated from humanity for over a decade, and has had to endure severe hardships; rather than feel these elements in Stewart's performance, I mostly got exactly what came out of Twilight- nothing. She has as much charisma as a 2x4 plank.<br /><br />To her credit, she does break away from the Twilight mold in a couple of scenes and appears to attempt to act, but it fails horribly. The scene in which she is rousing the kings troops left me smacking my face with my palm in disbelieve that such a sensitive moment could have been portrayed so poorly, and her one-liner after killing the queen that the queen would \\"never take [her] heart\\" was just... Just atrociously depicted.<br /><br />For every other aspect of the movie, I would give a solid 5 stars, the supporting acting, artistic design, music, and script are all well done.<br /><br />Kristin Stewart's job earned a full 2 stars simply because she at least made the attempt to act in a scene or two.<br /><br />Overall, I give the movie 3 stars. If you REALLY want to, see it in a theater in 2-d (not worth the extra price for the 3-d one), and wait for the dvd price to drop to 10 or 15 bucks if you feel the need to own it.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|use on kindle fire. it worked great for a while but now freezes on a loading game page. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it but it still freezes.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I like horses so I like horse movies. This is a great one to watch with your family. So enjoy.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have been waiting forever it seems for this game to be available for the kindle fire. its a great game, but that lag keeps sending me to my doom please try to fix this as soon as possible. thanks :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|absolute love the first two books. They were well written.  The third one was also good but a little too dragging.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved this show!  It's very much a soap opera type show that is set in pre-World War I England.<br />I was sucked in at the very first episode and am axiously awaiting Season 3.
B0086700CM|5.0|whoever created temple run needs a metal or something. I mean this guy's a genius about a kid's mind. so cool
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|What the...?  Huh?  What just hap...?  Why?<br /><br />All I have to say is WOW.  This movie made no sense whatsoever.  Brad Pitt barely finishes a few sentences.  Sean Penn says a couple of words.  No one ever finishes a thought.  One minute we're looking at a young boy stealing his neighbor's night gown and the next we're watching dinosaurs romping through a river before mankind existed.  Then there's tons of whispering you can barely hear followed by insanely deep, loud bass.  Great cinematography though.  Obviously the movie ends just as horribly - which was completely predictable - but it could have come a lot sooner!!!  The tree of life?  I just don't get it.  Sure, I've read other reviews talking about the parallels between our life here on Earth and the cosmos above, and something blah blah blah about God, but this failed to accomplish that...which I assume was the main premiss of the movie.<br /><br />Do NOT waste your time.  Awful, awful, awful!!!!!  AWFUL!!
B003F3NE1Q|4.0|I'm obsessed with the Greys series, however this season had back packaging. The DVD disk holders broke out of no where and my disks became scratched because of this. So sometimes I can't watch an entire episode because the disk skips over \\"damaged area,\\" when though when i look at the DVD there appear to be no visible scratches. Despite this I'm still in love with this series and am thankful I have already seen the episodes and am rewatching them, otherwise I'd be a very unhappy camper.
B007FOH7UU|5.0|Fantastic album - they've returned to the sound of their first and unbelievably great album, Hopes & Fears.  From start to finish, beautiful.  If you like Keane at all, you will love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very entertaining, and they have some very easy games and some challenging ones as well. there are games on here for everyone to play.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game, but the only problem I have is sometimes their are random lag spikes that will kill me but still a greaat app :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is fun and addicting. Great puzzle game to kill time. Not so difficult to be frustrating but not so easy that you get bored.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is fun because it is very challenging.  this game keeps me intertained when I am board. glade I got this game.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|I really love Underworld and Underworld: Evolution. I'm not too keen on Underworld: Rise of the Lycans, but it was passable. Unfortunately, Underworld: Awakening is a sad entry for what could have been a great addition to the series.<br /><br />If you remember Evolution that movie ended with big changes for Selene, Michael and the rest of the Vamp community. Awakening does not cover that period, instead it picks up 12 or so years after. What follows is a convulted plot that does answer most of the questions hardcore viewers are wondering about. The movie attempts to be a mysterious, but it fails to do so and just leaves you wondering why Kate B. would sign off on this drivel. After saying no to so many proposed sequels, she picks this script to say yes to. I'm shaking my head as a write this.<br /><br />I haven't written off this franchise. It could improve. There seemed to be some new ground to explore, but I'm not liking where the series has gone and wish they would retcon this movie all together.<br /><br />Save your money and rent this....
B001CL4N68|5.0|I have the audio technica ath-m50 and they make this album even more amazing.  I bought this album and let me tell you something.  This is the greatest album I have ever listened to in my life.  Nas is a lyrical mastermind.  Trust me, I listen to real rappers who can actually rap, not that young money crap.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Every song gives me goosebumps. Her voice is refreshing. Will continue to buy as many albums as she will put out.

B002LVUKJ2|5.0|I have always loved this game. Now I have it all in one.<br /><br />Let's Play! I'm coming Officer! Right Away Sir!<br /><br />lol
B000056HOZ|5.0|I purchased the DVD set as a gift for my son. It has become one of his favorites and he plays it all the time. I bow to his opinion on this as I personally do not care for Bruce Springsteen.
B00881VLCE|5.0|if you like puzzles but don't have the space to do them then this app is for you!!!!! Lots of choices in the free catagory. This will keep me busy for months!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I wanted a quick and easy read, and this book did not disappoint. What John Locke says makes sense, although it does go counter to what many others say about marketing. For example, John Locke posts only once a month on his blog. Most marketing gurus say you should post several times a week. I don't know what the \\"correct\\" number should be, but it was refreshing to get another take on how to do things. I am going to try some of his suggestions and see if his methods work for me. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as I like to say, and certainly he has a track record to prove his method works. I am glad he shared it in this book, which was quite entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think temple run is the best game for people with game addiction because it is so addicting. temple run is soooooo awesome.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a fun twist to mario like game. i am having fun with it. so is my son.good game to play
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I read the reviews that said how great the sound was and how much better you sounded to the person you were calling.  Not so much :(  No better then using the speaker phone.<br /><br />Don't bother with this product.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I wish it was a little easier to run further, but overall the game rewards more practice.
B0086700CM|5.0|Well this game identity only fun its addictive! Get this you just need to have fast reflexes. I think this game is TOTALLY worth it!!!!!!!!! Well got to go I want to play it NOW!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love these types of games. This one has a lot of levels, some easy some challenging. I am still working on finishing all the levels and appreciate that it hasn't taken only a day to finish the game. I have not had any problems with this app on my Kindle Fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome! I loved playing it on my friends ipod but now I can do it on my kindle! thank you android
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is right up there along with sudoku for me. I am addicted. . . . . . . .
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very fun game and easy to learn! becomes addictive. but watch out for reviving. it will empty your wallet! well worth the download though!
B005MMY5RK|2.0|After going to the Hurst Castle, which was Hurst's home in California, we wanted to see his life.<br /><br />Hurst's castle is amazing, with the most eclectic collection of art, antiqity, he just bought<br />everything he could in Europe and had it built into his home.  The museum treats Hurst as a very<br />special man.<br /><br />I know that he had a yellow journalistic and political side.  While there is no movie called Hurst<br />Citizen Kane is about Hurst, thinly disguised.  In spite of my motivation I just could not get into<br />it.  It really did not tell his story.  I don't know why it's such a classic.<br /><br />I viewed it downstreaming from Amazon, a great service.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is definetly one of the best apps ever!  and its free!  yes it is simple and yes it does lag once in awhile but its simplicity is what makes it so great.  it can really draw u in and its challenging to beat goals and unlock new stuff.  you should definitely give this game a try.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a fantasy series in years.  I am so impressed by the depth of the world and characters Ryan has created.  I hope to see many more books in this series.
B0000033OZ|5.0|I don't think I've ever heard a more devastatingly beautiful song than  Take a Pebble.  That song alone makes this one of the best LPs of all time and space.  The rest of the album ain't that shabby either.  In my opinion however Lucky Man is a weakness on this fine piece of work. I realize that many will not agree with this but for me it just doesn't fit emotionally or musically.  Take that song off and you have a pure masterpiece.  Still, due to the overall strength of this LP it gets five stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a challenging game but relaxing at the same time. I really enjoy the soundtrack,  it is so beautifully done. But be careful, it's addictive
B0086700CM|5.0|love this game! just needs more bonuses,  characters &amp; levels. tired of the same thing. that is all. lol. (:
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what I needed. a simple calculator. fast. easy to use. and the most important thing....... its free.<br />I recommend it
B00846REIS|2.0|I actually DNF'd this book at about 72% completed. It had gotten to the point that I was just plain old bored by Eva and Gideon and didn't even want to pick it up to bother to read the last bit of it.<br /><br />The book actually started out great. I was sure I was going to love it. Right out the gate, Eva seemed strong and self aware and didn't give into Gideon's crap. I really liked her and thought she was refreshing. I flat out loved the setting in NYC and the fact that SD made me feel like I was if not in NYC, then at least in a big city with all it's diversity.<br /><br />But then...sigh. Eva began this cycle to getting angry and running away only to have Gideon chase her and explain. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.<br /><br />By the time I got a little more than halfway through it, all of my good feelings of this couple had begun to evaporate. They no longer felt like the smart, self aware people I had given them credit for. Everything became so overwrought and overly-dramatical. Every word, sigh, and expression seemd to have some deeply sexual and soulful meaning. It was exhausting. Not to mention for two adult professionals -- one of whom manages a multi-billion dollar conglomerate -- they felt awfully immature at times.<br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that while I ADORE Sylvia Day's historical romance voice, anything outside the HR genre that she has written just doesn't work for me. This was the same for me with her [[ASIN:0765360411 Eve of Darkness (Marked, Book 1)]]series. I barely made it through half the first book and gave up.<br /><br />OTOH, [[ASIN:0758231741 Seven Years To Sin]]was darned near a 5-star book for me. Talk about a couple who were sexy, sophisticated and emotional! [[ASIN:0758214758 The Stranger I Married]] was the first SD book I'd ever read years ago and I could just read that book over and over again. Wonderful.<br /><br />So, I am just going to probably stick with her historicals from here on out.
B006PERRMY|2.0|This script is pure gold.  What an amazing concept.  No more currency -- time is now the currency.  Buying a cup of coffee for 4 minutes off your life.  It's pure gold.  It really is.  However, the direction was poor, and the movie fell way short on what it could have been.<br /><br />Timberlake did a good job.  It wasn't his fault that the director crapped the bed on this one.  Justin Timberlake has pretty much solidified himself as a well rounded, excellent actor.  I have no issues whatsoever with his performance.  It was believable, and he did the best with what direction he was given.  Cillian Murphy (Timekeeper) gave an incredible performance.  It's too bad it was wasted.<br /><br />I was actually explaining to a friend the other day the concept of this movie, and my friend was like, \\"Holy [explicit], that sounds amazing!\\" And it does.  Like I said, unbelievable concept.  They just did not properly execute it.  2.5 stars overall.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  I am amazed by Cheryl's story and strength.  She is an excellent writer and inspiring person.
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG this game is awesome. it keeps you occupied for hours if you feel like playing it for a long time. it is perfect if you are going on a long not bumpy trip and you have nothing beget to do.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all three FIfty Shades books in one weekend.. really got hooked on the story in book one.  I liked the characters and couldnt stop reading books one and two.  Book three went a little slower for me. The sex scenes in books 1 and 2 were a little shocking but fun to read because it was new, interesting and entertaining.  By book 3 however, I found myself skipping through a lot of the sex scenes because it was SO much and when they did manage to not have sex and have a conversation, the conversations were repetative.  Like a lot of the other reviewers the whole \\"dont bite your lip\\" thing got a little annoying and her \\"inner goddess\\" just seemed silly after reading it so many times throughout all the books. I wish that Anastasia was a little bit stronger as the main female in this book.  I understand the series was about Dominance but it would have been nice to see her not so worried constantly about making Christian mad.  Overall, it was a good series that did keep me entertained and I was sad to have an end to these characters.  I have recommended these books to many of my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app I very good I can play for ever and it never gets boring I recommend this app to every one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very entertaining game. There is so much to do I just wish I had enough energy to do it all. I also love that you can play without being on line.
0393080269|5.0|I am an economics major, and am interested in studying global trends. I read many books that focus on specifics of nations. I was hoping for a general book that glances over the globe and gives me a fair idea of where many regions/nations stand at the moment. This book did just that.<br /><br />I was considering waiting a while before buying this book ($17 is usually above my price range), but I was so interested that I gave it a shot. I am really glad I got it when I did. The topics are current, and they are working great to flash around knowledge of other countries in business talks!<br /><br />I think the book is organized well, starting with the biggest and perhaps most talked-about nations - China, India, Russia... then moving on the less talked about - Turkey, South Africa, etc. Much of the first 3 chapters is stuff that I've read elsewhere. People who study the economies of other nations may feel the same way. I found the bits on the more obscure nations more valuable.<br /><br />That said, the book did provide a generally good insight on where the larger nations are headed. For example, why the Brazilian economy is much less stable and unbalanced than most imagine. The author's \\"rules of the road\\" are perhaps the most valuable - such as be careful of nations that have only focused development on one concentrated metropolitan area.<br /><br />Overall, I think those that want a good \\"Introduction to the Current Economies of the World\\", this is a perfect book. It is well written, does have econ jargon that might be a little difficult to grasp, but overall quite easy to understand. Most of all, the author knows what he's talking about. Although he may be quite opinionated (always take readings on the economy with a grain of salt), it is clear that he is well experienced and his view is very valuable. I love this book, and will continue to reference it for quick refreshers on nations I am looking at. Get this book while its fresh! (the topics are very current!)

0525425764|2.0|First Sentence: The accused was a wealthy man by the name of Pete Duffy, and his alleged crime was murder.<br /><br />How I Acquired the Book: I borrowed this book from my town's library.<br /><br />*You may not get what I am talking about in this review if you have not read the first two books in the series.*<br /><br />The Review: My fascination with John Grisham first began a few years ago, when I saw my father reading one of his novels. I don't recall which one it was, but it was about a trial and the lawyers, as always. I promised to myself, since I was a kid at the time (still am), that I would read his adult novels when I grew up someday. A few years later, the first Theodore Boone novel came out, and I, as a kid, was instantly drawn to it. I thought, perhaps I wouldn't have to wait that long to read a Grisham novel! And then I read it, and it ended on a cliffhanger, so of course I wanted the second one. When the second one came out, I raced to the library. I read it. And I was so, so, disappointed.<br /><br />Now, I do not claim to know John Grisham's works very well, since, as I stated before, I am a teenager. However, I do know enough that John Grisham is apparently the master of the legal thriller. After reading these three novels in the Theodore Boone series, I have trouble believing that.<br /><br />Why? Well, the first one was fine. It was short and kind of incomplete, but it had some nice Law-and-Order style drama. Why was I disappointed by the second one? Because it had nothing to do with the first one. This third book in the series faces the same problem.<br /><br />The second one focused on a kidnapping. This one focuses on a robbery. But that isn't the reason why I'm so annoyed. The reason is, HE IS NOT FOCUSING ON THE PETE DUFFY MURDER TRIAL. Sure, in the beginning of the book, there's a bit of tension with him. But that's it. Like in The Abduction, Duffy is pushed off to the side and completely forgotten about.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham has to realize that what draws people to his books are the courtroom aspect of it. Perhaps he thinks that with young children, who are the people this book is marketed to, he can get away with delaying it, putting it off; perhaps he even thinks this ramps up the suspense. But it's not working. Just think of it this way: if you heard about Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer and knew you would have to wait two, possibly three more years for the conclusion to it, would you want to read it? If you knew, the author was going to write filler novel after filler novel in the series, not advancing the plot he started in the first book, would you want to read it?<br /><br />I'll be counting how many books it takes for Mr. Grisham to return to what I started reading Theodore Boone for. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to realize that changing the subject pointlessly in this series is not what we want. I'll be counting how many books it takes for him to write about the darned Pete Duffy murder trial again. I'll be counting.<br /><br />-reviewed by a teenager.

B0086700CM|5.0|definitely worth downloading!!! all it is is running away from the temple monkeys, but with lots of twists and turns and plently of upgrades. I'm soo glad this is free!
B0086700CM|5.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy a Kindle game as much as I enjoy Temple Run. I'm not a young person, but I play TR every day. It's a great stress tamer and lots of fun. Thanks,  Imangi.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun! hope they update soon so there will be new games to play. I cant believe this game is free.
B0076UXKDG|4.0|I think giving 3 or fewer stars for this product is misleading, particularly if it's just to protest the price.  I agree it costs double what it should cost.  However, it's a quality product that matches the build quality of the camera.  The ability to use AA batteries is important to me and the ergonomics for vertical shooting is very helpful.  One complaint that I've had with ALL the Nikon grips, including this one, is that Nikon uses different shutter release and D-pad buttons than what the camera uses.  The shutter release button is very springy and doesn't have the two-step half and full press tactile feedback.  You just start pushing and at some point it focuses and then some point later it'll fire the shutter.  The distance required to press the button is much further too...just a tactile disappointment.  The D-pad is completely different from the one on the camera.  For $450, we should have the same shutter release and Dpad buttons as on the camera.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|even though I started this game my son loves it...he is young and it keeps him entertained. I will say dome of the games are hard for me.

B007SGM084|3.0|I loved these three books and the story line so much. I hung in there till the end because I really wanted to know what was going to happen to everyone.  The BUT is the amount of sex.  Don't get me wrong I am not a prude but it was happening so much that I felt I needed to keep a score card. There was sooooo much of it that I started skipping those parts and became desensitized to all of it.
0385342063|5.0|Although I am a fan of Sophie Kinsella's books in general this has been my favorite heroine since Becky Bloomwood! It's funny, touching, sweet, and honest all at the same time. The storyline might be a little far-fetched in terms of everthing that happens but the idea that phones are so integral to daily life is very true. It's easy to imagine that oh-my-goodness-my-life-is-in-that-phone feeling.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but it's very believable in that it's not too much of a perfect situation. There are so many moments where you can practically feel the akwardness of the situation coming off the pages. It's worth the hardcover price, too!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|uninstalled. do not like Zynga.  wont play their games ever. shady business.<br /><br />sad because I liked this game. but uninstalling it now.
B00881VLCE|1.0|there are only a few puzzles of cats. the good puzzles have to be bought. not worth the download time
B0088LU3P0|3.0|Betty had one good moment in the episode and as seems par for the course, any good moment for one character this season requires someone else to pay a heavy price. The entire storyline leading up to what happened wasn't very believable or even in character for the person. It was as if they had decided to do something to a particular character and then backtracked from there to come up with a reason. The script itself at one point seems to question its own illogic. In the end, a failed attempt or a different method might have been more credible.<br /><br />Glen was less unlikable than in any of his previous experiences which is quite an accomplishment. I keep waiting for them to pull the rug out and reveal that he is still the disturbed character he was at the beginning. But so far they seem to be going in a whole other direction.<br /><br />Not having the final moment where Don tells Megan what happened seems like a mistake. It would been extremely interesting to see how Don viewed it and explained it from his own context. They did it in a subtile indirect way with the ending, but IMO it would have been more interesting direct.<br /><br />The scene between Ken and Roger was excellent. The Dow Chemical meeting was less so. What they came up with for Don to say wasn't very interesting or inspiring.

0812973992|4.0|Above, a man walks on a tightrope between the Twin Towers.  Below, a whole city lives...lives that are so different, yet the connections are unavoidable.  Prostitutes, Irish monks, a judge, a Park Avenue wife, an African American woman.  I love how the story weaved around each of these characters, and then, there it is, the tightrope above and around them.  This story could only have been set in New York City, the city that has no past or future, just a present.

B006L1GOLG|5.0|Amazon videos stream so well and I am a diehard amazon client. In all honesty, the fact that apple products (i.e. ipads) don't have flash player, and therefore I can't stream Amazon content is just another reason to stay in the Android world!

0345803485|3.0|This book is just OK.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention and for actually leaving me wanting to read book 2.  The caveat is that I got this as a library e-book and I plan on getting the next one the same way - I would not pay money for this book.<br /><br />This book is outside of my normal genre (mystery, suspense) and I wasn't sure what to expect from a supposedly \\"erotica\\" book, but this didn't seem too erotica in my mind.  It more read like a silly romance novel with some weird very descriptive sex scenes.  The BDSM really didn't seem all that it was hyped up to be - definitely more than your usual book but I didn't feel it was that over-the-top.  The sex scenes actually made me giggle because of the way they were written.  I started skimming over them because they bored me and I was more interested in the character development - of which there is little in the beginning and only moderate in the end.<br /><br />I knew going into this book that the writing was supposedly bad, and it lives up to that.  It feels like it is written from a teenage girl's perspective, and I find it hard to believe that Anastasia is THAT innocent, for a college senior.  The adjectives are overused - Christian's \\"long fingers\\" and the amount of times that Ana blushes will make you want to tear your hair out.  The inner dialogue between Ana's subconscious and her inner goddess is downright ridiculous and beyond annoying.  I also thought that Christian was going to be older - early 40s perhaps.  The fact that he is 27 really makes it hard to take him seriously, because most 27 year old guys are not that mature or successful.  If I were going to read a naughty fantasy book, I certainly would not fantasize that I was a virgin or have my fantasy man be a 27 year old (and I am a 29 year old female).<br /><br />Another thing about the writing that irritates me is that it is obvious that the author is British, yet the book is supposed to take place in Seattle.  The writing style uses words that Americans just don't use, such as \\"bloody\\", \\"pram\\", and \\"rucksack\\".  It made it harder to immerse myself in the book because it made it feel even more staged.<br /><br />That all being said, the book is an easy and quick read and it did make me wonder why Christian is so screwed up, which is what kept me reading it and why I will read book 2.  It is by no means award winning, but could make an easy summer read for someone.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I never grow tired of reading Twain's classic, and I'm glad this edition is available for free. Every American should read this if they haven't already.
0440241901|5.0|Sophia Kinsella's writing always leaves me laughing, and this book is no exception.  I was literally laughing out loud at parts, and I found the book utterly charming and captivating.  It was an easy and fast read and makes me wish there was a series about the characters.  I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting a fun read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|only problem is that it freezes. once in a while.  Also can not figure. how to update but fun to play.
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Interesting to read. A well known but still interesting book. If you look for something to get you away from your current thinking and relax your brain.
B007RI56NY|2.0|Don't like it,  What happen to the what we heard on Save Me San Fran,  Sounds like he wrote a song for each category of music,  country, rap, spanish, ect..  and then a few slow songs that you just kind of press fast forward,  noting like Marry me..  Ok,  its a fun album and I got a few laughs out of it. But it's a head scratcher,  I miss his strong vocals like in Save Me San Fran, Parachute, Words, Brick By Brick, Soul Sister.  This cd  he just talks through not much strong singing...  50 ways sound just like Drive By with the words changed.<br />No real sing alongs  only  Drive by which does make me smile..  So its passable,  but if I were to grab a cd for a trip it would be  Save me or Drops,  this one may just collect dust.<br />But Train does put on one heck of a  Live show if they come to your home town,  go see them and get up front you will have a knee slapp'en good time.!!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This is a great little pool. The slide is a bit close to the edge when you go down the slide. Also, the slide does not lift up for cleaning which is a bit gross. We had no hole issues and the slide always stays firm for our 35 pound 2 year old!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Seeing all the superheroes come together was excellent, however, the pace could have been quicker. I expected to see some non- stop action after knowing they would all bring different talents to the table. Iron Man added humor to the movie and Thor (who was very easy on the eyes:)was excellent as he showed brotherly love toward his villain brother. The Hulk was better here than he was in The Hulk movie but his \\"hulk\\" scenes were not plentiful(although Iron Man just to provoke him to turn with his antics). The story plot could have been better but they made you forget that as they all battled in the end. There were some terrific action scenes in the end which makes you wonder why didn't they throw some of this in the beginning. Would have been nice to see Thor stretch his muscles early on.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have been playing this game for a long time and all of a sudden it says I have no coins. even after I receive coins they automatically go away :(
B006RUJST6|5.0|I never expected to love these books as I do.  (Slammed 1 & 2)  If someone had told me the level of emotions to expect while reading, I honestly would have never given them a chance.  I usually gravitate to the \\"feel-good romance\\" section.  Don't get me wrong, there is a beautiful romance here, but lots of other emotions to go with it.<br /><br />That being said, this is now one of my top recommendations that I will give my friends.  Beautifully written, intelligent and POWERFUL.<br /><br />Read this book!
B007L96SI6|5.0|The type of CD I can play at home and just let it play. Then I can move it to the car and turn it up loud and try to sing along. She has a great voice and it's not the same music you hear on every radio station.

0345803507|5.0|Sometimes you just have to go for it for yourself.  I had bought the first book of this series on 5/30/2012.  I am a fast reader and knew that this book would be read by sometime Thursday night or Friday morning and I was right.  I went to the reviews for Fifty Shades Darker and some people were just bashing the book and the series.  I love classics just like anyone else but I had already read most of the first one and was trying to decide if I should buy the second and I was so put off by the bad reviews that I almost didn't purchase it.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that I have never read this type of book before ever and I am 42 years old.  I am more the historical, documentary and criminal mystery type but seeing and hearing everyone talking about the book, I became intrigued.  They asked Michelle Obama about it, they began pulling it from libraries because of the sexual content and it was also being displayed front and center in my favorite Japanese bookstore and I said to myself, \\"Self, see what all the fuss is about.\\"  Boy am I glad that I did!<br /><br />Maybe it's because I am not a fantasy, love story type and, therefore, have never read a book like this before but I loved the series.  It is now 6/4/2012 and I have read all three within 5 days.  I have to tell you, I felt a lot for the characters, I was rooting for some, cursing at others, I teared up at other times and, quite frankly, I didn't want the books to end.  I understood Christian Grey, I felt for Christian Grey and I loved the way these books showed his break down process and his progress.  His humanity is what I connected to almost as much as being the naive wide eyed and bushy-tailed Anastasia.  I've met Christian Greys and I was Anastasia.  Sometimes two extreme types have to meet in order to take us from those extreme left or right sides and bring us to the middle or to strike a balance.  Honestly, after a while, I didn't even care about the sexual scenes but about the characters andwhere they were headed.<br /><br />Like I stated in the title, this is not a literary classic.  It certainly could have been edited better and I would have preferred it to not be so repetitive but this is her style of writing.  I don't read too many British authors so I have nothing to compare it to.  I looked past the bad writing and looked to the story and I found it to be fabulously fun and quick paced.  I truly didn't want this to end.  Hopefully, she can make a series from Christian's perspective because I love the end of the book where she started to show his view.  I hope she is just prepping us for what is to come.<br /><br />Read all three books because it is a continuous storyline and just let yourself escape.  Don't take it too seriously and have a good time.  I found that I read too many serious things and this was a welcome break for me.  I will try another fantasy/erotic/love story sometime in the future.  Don't take it too seriously and take it for what it is (and I am quoting from other reviewers): Literary Crack!!  I hope this helps!!

0345803485|1.0|I enjoy reading erotica. My favorite is Anne Rice's 'The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty' trilogy. I bought these books because of all the craziness surrounding them and I felt they would be good, even though my daughter warned me not to since the author claimed Twilight was her inspiration (or something like that). Also, I happen to really love the movie 'Secretary', so a book that combines my favorite book and movie can't be bad, right?<br /><br />Despite my daughter's word of caution I bought them and now consider these books a waste of my money. I had to force myself to finish reading 3 chapters and am left wondering \\"were these books written by a 16 year old virgin\\"!?. I would say more but it seems that all the other 1,591 1-star ratings have pretty much covered all the bases.<br /><br />I will say this, it saddens me that these books are on the best sellers list.<br /><br />If you want to read really good erotica, I HIGHLY suggest The Claiming of Sleepy Beauty (http://www.amazon.com/The-Sleeping-Beauty-Novels-Punishment/dp/0452156610/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1338839263&sr=1-2).

My students were asked to write about what they would like to accomplish in life and explain how they would achieve their goal.  It is such an inspiring and encouraging book for people of all ages.  I also purchased a copy as a graduation gift for my daughter.
B003UMW68Y|4.0|I thought I was getting a Blu-Ray and a DVD but it is actually a Blu-Ray and a digital copy. The option to get a digital copy with the Blu-Ray disc is actually a whole other link on Amazon. I have a Blu-Ray player so it's not a big deal but I wanted to get the DVD as well, which is why I bought this version of it. I already opened it because I thought it was what I had ordered. I didn't realize that I had received the wrong item until I saw that it did not have a DVD inside. Unfortunately, this means I can't send it back. I guess it's not that bad considering I can play it with my Blu-Ray player. But I'm still not completely happy about my purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say.  I read through all three books in the trilogy in two weeks, and I need more.  I really hope E.L. James continues the Meet Fifty Shades epilogue transforming it into another book in the series.

B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this game it is different from her games that I have played on the kindle! it has so many features and allows to keep on moving up... I have not experienced any kind of lag.. I definitely recommend this game
B002ZG97M4|4.0|I was a little skeptical about this remake. but i was very surprised on how well it was made. this movie ended up being pretty good (thanks to denis quad for being such a great actor) i thought that the cast was excellent. i can't say that for to many remakes. but the original is still the best. i was a liitle worried about the guy who played willard since chris peen did such an awesome job. but the new guy held his ground. julianne hough did a pretty good job as ariel. kenny wormald was not to bad as ren,  but kevin bacon was better. i measn keny did a good job don't get me wrong but kevin was better. the original always is. and last but not least dennis quad was excellent as shaw moore. him and john lithgow are equales. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do. p.s. they should of kept the tractor scene. one thing i do have to say is that they did tell what happend to shaw's son. in the first the just tell you in the movie not show you like in this one.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|My favorite song on this album is \\"Nowhere Man.\\"  Some awesome singing and harmonies that make this song one of the best all-time hits.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I'll admit it took me a couple of chapters to get into this book.  Meeting Poppy during a crisis wasn't a great first impression, but once I was into it I couldn't put this book down.  It's the kind of romantic, funny chick book you hope for every time you read one, but one of the few that is genuinely fantastic.  I wish I could read it again for the first time!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Ex-Confederate cavalry officer is accidentally transported to mars...<br /><br /> SAVE THE PRINCESS<br /> SAVE THE PLANET<br /><br />I have been reading John Carter novels for fourty years and I appreciate all the efford made to bring it to the big screen..including the shoostring asylum effort \\"Princess of Mars\\", which had a few good scenes but most people found it less than appealing.<br /><br />  Whicl leads to the name game for \\"John Carter\\". I am sure to avoid confusion with the asylum \\"sucker punch\\", \\"A Princess of Mars\\", was left at the starting gate.  \\"John Carter of Mars\\" is actually the title of the last book in the John Carter/John Carter of Mars/Barsoomian series so that may be why it was left out as well as not trumping the moment when John Carter of Earth decicdes he is John Carter of Mars.  \\"John Carter under the Moons of Mars\\" would harken back to the origional magazine release title, but is a mouthfull and telegraphs that he is going to mars..trumping another nice revealing moment in the movie.  \\"John Carter and the Moons of Mars\\" is catchier, but since, in a later book in the series he actually goes to one of the moons of mars, it might be a tad confusing. \\"John Carter and the Princess\\" is nice..since it starts out as a western there could be a native american princess he could meet..but, on mars, since they kept the knowledge that Dejah Thoris was a princess from John Carter for over half the movie, it might be considerd too revealing (in the book it was not kept hidden). Also, all of the books concern princeses including his daughter and granddaughter.  Lets see...\\"John Carter: Man of Two Worlds\\"...not bad and somewhat historical...\\"John Carter's Great Adventure\\" ehh...\\"John Carter's Fantastic Adventure\\" is somewhat historical but it would be considered overstating or too revealing...\\"John Carter Begins\\" is a bit modern, but its does put grin on my face...but since they were thinking it might not do well they would actually think of it as \\"John Carter Ends\\"...but John Carter won't end, his motto in the book is \\"I still live\\"...and now that we have the first movie in the can, he can be rebooted, or retroed, or begun by someone else if Disney doesn't continue.  \\"John Carter: I still Live!\\"...I like it, oops, they forgot to put his motto in the moive!...though perhaps he said something like \\"I am still alive\\" near the end or in his diary, so it couild be ok.  I will go with that.  It's not any worse than their choice for sure.<br /><br />  As for touching moments in the movie, it does have a very telling \\"My Jeddek\\" scene, but its not with John Carter who has apparently left the building...the princess has finally come to terms with her fate...its such a quick scene but it says so much....which leaves only Dotar Sojat to save Helium.  Tars Tarkas, sola, Wolla, Kantos Kan and the princess bring a lot of wit, humor, and banter to the show.  After all, this a love story in the midst of wars that have been going on for many generations.  But it doesn't feel that way entirely, thanks to our heroes who are hoping that things can be differant.<br /><br />  Its a much smaller world then ERB imagined (some twenty-five plus city-states have been reduced to two and a couple of green martian hordes out of five)...but it has great detail which I cain't wait to look at on blue-ray (the Jasoomian 10th ray!)...In the book \\"A Princess of Mars\\" there were a few princesses....in the movie we have two...most probably overlook the fact that Sola is a green martian princess...in true ERB fashion she is a hidden princess...<br /><br />  The Barsoomina 8th ray (which repels against \\"mars\\" and is treated as a gas in sealed tanks in the book) appears to be used in conjunction, so it would seem, with another ERB technology, the \\"equilibrimotor\\" to move the craft since they no longer seem to have movement via propellers driven by radium powered motors. Per the screen play, the \\"motor\\" is solar powered and extra energy is stored. Hence the dramatic flying action is driven in the movie by having the sun dimmed by shadow or sandstorm...<br /><br />  Age isn't mentioned in the movie...in the book 1000 years is normal (optional trip down the River Iss at that point) and you probably start to look old long before 2000 years have passed...so the princess, given her accomplishments is probably in the 35 to 80 range...I say this as the viewpoints of the characters in the movie are very clear...they have had a lot of time to think about things...The sound track is quite good, I listen to it while doing chores or killing orcs in LOTRO... I consider it a very good movie...many scenes are quite captivating and not easily forgotten...its nice to have another scifi adventure that you can watch with your family...I am hoping for extended scenes on blue-ray and for more of the 11 books to come forth as movies.<br /><br />  Saddly, there is not much tie-in to the movie...a sound track, some books...a few other things for kids....where is the mmorpg? If they can do it for Lord of the Rings, Connan, and Star Wars..why not Baroom?  A high level inner circle group of ERB fans came up with a private report showing the sad state of Barsoomian computer games, most are incompleete and a lot will never be finished...two are funtional, but one of them is on an obsolete computer...the other has five massave Barsoomian scenarios written by me for the 1994 popular strategy game Empire Deluxe...which amazingly installs and runs on win7 32bit.  So I have been conquering Barsoom with one of the six major factions for fifteen years...but its real nice to see the beautiful small scale action in the movie.e dramatic flying action is driven in the movie by having the sun dimmed by shadow or sandstorm...<br /><br />  Age isn't mentioned in the movie...in the book 1000 years is normal (optional trip down the River Iss at that point) and you probably start to look old long before 2000 years have passed...so the princess, given her accomplishments is probably in the 35 to 80 range...I say this as the viewpoints of the characters in the movie are very clear...they have had a lot of time to think about things...The sound track is quite good, I listen to it while doing chores or killing orcs in LOTRO...

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The power cord to my Kindle crumbled and frayed.  I contacted customer service and they immediately replaced both the USB charger and power adapter AT NO CHARGE to me since this is a known manufacturing defect. (1-866-321-8851) Kudos to Amazon/Kindle for their customer service!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a great game and im so glad its finally on amazon. it didnt get five stars because every once in a while it does hesitate itself and then i end up loosing my life. other than that thoo its great
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is very well written.  As a writer myself I am often picky about which books I read that are \\"main stream\\" since many of them have disappointed me in the past.  It took me a while to finally decide to read this particular triology, and am I glad I did!  I couldn't seem to put it down.  I am thinking I may want to go back and even re-read it a little slower to really absorb the whole thing.  Even my husband, who is not much of a reader, decided to read this and loved it.  The plot is great, it keeps the book moving, but I think more importantly the characters are really 3 demensional and very human.  Well worth the read!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and free.  That's five stars in my book.  It is good for all ages.
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought this on 29th of May after hearing such great reviews. I was finishing up on another book and decided to begin reading this on Friday , by Sunday mid day I was done!!!!!! I just could not put this book down. I was actually upset because my Ipad battery ran out. Needless to say I was reading with it plugged in for a time.<br />A very good read!!!!!!!!!
1400069289|4.0|Habits can make us or break us.  We are definitely creatures of habit, from an evolutionary point of view and practically speaking.  We need habits to conserve mental energy and to be efficient.  The cliche example is now the number of variations to get dressed in the morning if you did not use habits - it's up in the millions (some people dress as if they've tried option 1.23 million).<br /><br />Habits create grooves in our brain that reinforce them.  The author explains the three components of a habit - the craving, the routine and the reward.  All three need to be taken into account when attempting to change a habit.  You need to become your own personal \\"habitologist\\" to first identify each of the three components and then potential substitutes for each, until you find the triad that works for you.  For example, if you find yourself stuffing your face with a coffee and donuts every afternoon, steadily gaining weight as you approach Michelin Man proportions, what specifically constitutes your habit?  Is the reward a soothing of hunger or is it stress release, when exactly does the habit occur, what is the craving you feel?  This analysis will help you replace a bad habit with a good one.<br /><br />The author also explains how organizational habits can be identified and harnessed to effect positive change.  He gives as an example Paul O'Neill's focus on safety when he took over the reigns of Alcoa.  By developing good habits around safety, claims Duhigg, other good habits also develop, in this case habits like offering suggestions for improved processes.  I don't know that I buy this entirely.  Perhaps its not the habit but the culture, which is a collection of many more things than just habits, that leads to better habits.  The same concern applies to his explanation of the success of the Birmingham bus boycott to social habits - the support of community for Rosa Parks because of her weak ties to many other people in Birmingham.  It seems to me that this castsaside the courage involved as well as the spiritual strengths that made the boycott a success.  Perhaps those social habits played a part, but, in my opinion, that part was small.<br /><br />Overall however, the book is great explanation of how habits are formed and how they can be changed.

B0071R43MG|5.0|The best quality and sound of any DVD Satriani has done and all of the them are pretty high quality.<br />Blue Ray definition and huge headroom sound.<br />Playing is flawless as one expects from Joe. Good selection of material and many from the last solo work. I like the set lost on this one the best. If you love guitar and either know about Joe or want to check it out, this is an outstanding work.<br />Joe is at his peak here and on the last Live in Paris DVD.<br />Just great, a must have.

B004LWZW42|5.0|As much as I liked the first two X-Men films, this one is on an even higher level for me. The plot is terrific, complex and the 60s setting lends a Bond-like groove to it, but the character development is very clear and easy to follow, and the conclusion is well-earned. Great ensemble cast. Excellent origin story, and it very organically sets up for a sequel(s), which if the same quality of film-making, I am eager for.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is cool got it for apple and aneroid devises but on aneroid I feel like its lathing in the game and the sensors. don't work properly. it irritates me a lot but the games awesome in any other way

0340896965|5.0|Weaving culture, recent history and romance with a truly skillful hand, author David Nicholls creates a tapestry of modern life filled with contrasting colors and characters so real you'll be sure you've sat next to them in a coffee shop. The snapshot approach where each chapter covers the same date through passing years works very naturally, each scene's end nicely tied to the next and backstory perfectly viewed through the characters' eyes. There's a really intriguing blend of messages in this novel too, carpe diem contrasting with persistence and patience, while success too cheaply offered is compared to success denied.<br /><br />Emma puts off both her dreams and her feelings for Dex, while Dex puts off any kind of hard work or commitment. Both settle, as real people so often do, for second bests and expediency. Both grow and change very believably through the years. And both somehow remain true to their hopes and their dreams.<br /><br />One Day is a surprisingly real, enthralling, hopeful, sad and humorous tale--like life painted in colors that almost make sense, the different threads all blending into something beautiful. There's a quintessential Englishness to time and place, great description, superb dialog, and an unsparing look at the trials and joys of modern life. Altogether it's a thoroughly good read and really hard to put down.<br /><br />Disclosure: My husband gave me this book for mothers' day. He has the knack of knowing just what I'll enjoy reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game,but what makes it a real 5 stars is it free for fire and cost on itunes only down side os there a few bugs
B002VPE1XE|2.0|The bag looks like the listed product, and the construction seemed fine.  My problem is, my camera does not fit.  According to my the owner's manual my camera has the dimension of 4.1 x 2.9 x 2.7 in.  Look carefully at the description of this camera bag and it says either 3.5 x 2.75 x 5 inches or 5 x 3.2 x 2.8 inches.  In either case my camera should fit inside, but it doesn't.  Go figure.
B0086700CM|5.0|game is sweet no problems except that if I leave for a couple seconds I lose my game but other than that its awesome
B007SGM084|1.0|These books were awful! I can't believe I paid so much for such trash! Half of the book was me just flipping pages through the sex acts
0345803485|2.0|Well, from this experience alone, the book is written like a how-to-read-for dummies, so it's very easy to understand what's going on between the charactors. However, I did not find CHristian at all alluring or anything like that. I don't know why Ana is even thinking about him. I mean, if you want Erotic, just read Zane. Now, that sista will make your head turn in the first paragraph. I even heard that some libraries were taking this book off the shelf, when Zane's books are clear in view. I'm glad i did not spend any  money on this book. It looks as if Christain is going to have a hard time displaying his feelings for Ana and Ana is going to lose her mind on this guy when she is fighting to restrain herself. christian is cocky, self-obsorbed, a little annoying, and looks like your average athleic. Why is he so rich at 27, maybe the author should have made him a drug dealer, now that would be interesting. Where are the other skanks in this book to make Ana go crazy. Where are the ex-employees that are plotting to kill him? Hey maybe even throw a little Eron in there for added effect. Okay, this would be a LIfetime movie or what? HA I can't believe they are thinking of making this book into a movie. Isn't Twlight Enough!!!!!!!!
1421532255|5.0|Where the actual product is concerned, it is just very finely made. The cover images are beautiful as well as the panel art and the image on the inside depicting L and Kira. Across the top of the pages, there's a countdown of how many days L has left to live. My friends find it morbid, but it really is just an excellent touch. There is a ribbon-bookmark too, something I always find useful. Most incredible/geeky part? It's written by \\"M\\". Mello. Just like how the Los Angeles BB Murder Cases was narrated by him. Just YES.<br /><br />The story is good too. It improved on the couple of things that bothered me in the movie. There is hilarity from seeing a more human side of L - other reviewers say it is out of character, but I could imagine him doing all things told in the novel. The only thing I would change would be how the doctor died as it was less dramatic than it was in the movie. And yes...they actually brought in the REAL Near!! :D<br /><br />Overall? Cool story, amazing product.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|very good book and series. I have all three of them. I liked the storyline and was well writen. I recommend it very much but it is not suitable for young people because the material has a lot of erotic writing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I give it 5 stars!  it is a awsome/addicting game.<br />I think that you need to lower the cost of the animals that cost acorns!
B001RONJYC|3.0|This movie was ok, it wasn't exciting or riveting, not what I expected. The actors just phoned in their performances except for wonderful actor who played Muddy Waters. Beyonce and Adrian Brodie gave a lackluster effort to their roles. A little disappointing, a good waste of time.

1439156816|4.0|Imagine yourself sitting in a bar in Boston watching a Red Sox game on television. The batter hits a hard shot up the middle and Dustin Pedroia nabs it on the bounce going away, flips the ball backwards from his glove to the shortstop to nail the lead runner. The middle-aged guy sitting three seats down from you nods.<br /><br />\\"That's the way I would have done it,\\" he says.<br /><br />Unless the guy's name is Rick Burleson, you are struck by the unmitigated gall of this bozo claiming to have the reflexes, sharpness of vision, timing, experience, and skill to replicate an act of athletic ballet that perhaps fewer than one person in a million could do.<br /><br />I find myself in the position of the blowhard in the bar reviewing what Mr. King has to say about writing. If I agree with him, it means I've advanced in my own writing part way along the path he's traveled. If I disagree, well, ....<br /><br />The first section of the book, \\"C.V.\\", is a memoir of King's life, his first attempts at writing, his early life, family, problems; in other words, the life experience that he brought to his writing and what made him a writer.<br /><br />He moves to \\"Toolbox\\" and writes about vocabulary, grammar and elements of style (and not in a stuffy English-class way). He recommends Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style\\", a book I've bought and given away, bought and loaned out, et al, to people I knew who wanted to make their writing better. His suggestions are pithy and useful, with concrete examples: use active, not passive voice, used 'said' instead of the multiple weaker alternatives, and removing adverbs, for example. His advice is human-scale; he admits to the inability to kill off all adverbs. His stated goal is to make competent writers good. He doesn't believe anything can make a writer great who isn't great already.<br /><br />He gets further into the meat of the book in \\"On Writing\\", telling what works for him: write a first draft as quickly (adverb!) as you can,let it cool for six weeks before doing your second draft (it'll give you fresh eyes when you go back), then seeking advice from competent readers. He stresses that writers need to read and write a lot; this is a craft, according to the subtitle of the book, and writers need to see what others do and practice.<br /><br />He also covers description (too little? too much? - a judgment call), dialogue, character, symbolism (if you find it in your book when re-reading the first draft, go with it), theme, pacing, research, writing classes and seminars (don't bother), getting an agent, and correct formatting. He gives some good examples. I disagreed with one item and that's only because the book is ten years old. He recommends \\"Writer's Digest\\", but since the internet has exploded since this was written, I'd recommend duotrope.com. It's more current and, I've heard, some of the editors that publishing houses say you should send your manuscript to are spurious names for their slush piles.<br /><br />I read that writers fall into two categories, the plotters (those that plot their books) vs. the pantsers (those that fly by the seat of their pants). King is firmly in the pants category. He believes that plot arrives from situations and attempts to force the story into a plot smothers the story.<br /><br />King devotes a section, \\"On Living: a Postscript\\", to his near-fatal accident, when he was hit by a van. The last two sections are a details example of the difference between his first and second drafts of \\"1408\\", and what he had been reading.<br /><br />This isn't a dry textbook, it's a fully realized story. The text on the back cover refers to it as 'friendly' and I agree. Picture a chance to sit at the kitchen table with Uncle Stevie over coffee and have him regale you with anecdotes, advice, stories and how-to examples, with family members dropping by. If you don't write and don't plan to, it's still worth the read. If you do, this will up your game. King is funny and has an ear for the telling phrase. He refers to bad writing as \\"shoveling s*** from a sitting position\\", says of himself \\"I was built with a love of the night and the unquiet coffin\\", and refers to people who learned to write in prison as \\"doing time in some of America's finest crossbar hotels.\\"<br /><br />I should note I'm prejudiced toward Mr. King. My wife and I chatted with him for a few minutes on the Mass Pike many odd years ago.<br /><br />Recommended, 4 stars.

1567184855|4.0|This book was very enlightening. Never thought of the afterlife in this way and now I understand more about spiritual life after our passing into eternity.  Interesting!
0345803485|4.0|I'm not a reader of \\"romance novels\\".  That being said, while the books are not what I would label as literary works of art, they are indeed intriguing and an excellent way to \\"get lost\\" in a ridiculous story that has enough interest and story line to it to keep a person reading through the entire trilogy.  Yes, it is unbelievable on many levels, written like a teenager was the author, but it does have a good story peppered with very descriptive sexual entanglements (excuse the pun).  It was well worth the read but taken at its true value and not on the order of literary works of art.
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie. Sat down with my family to have an enjoyable evening watching a movie. The movie started out bad and got worse from there! First, I was SHOCKED AT SOOOOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE !!! It was completely UNNECESSARY!!  Didn't help the movie at all.  Second, very depressing film. Guess it could be viewed as close to real life in a depressing situation. Movie started with this attorney who hadn't been home to spend time with his family. Daughters didn't even know him.  Lots of teen attitude. I do have to say that in this downer of a movie there is the boyfriend Sid ( comes across a loser, but actually has some deep thoughts). He has some great lines and he is what I enjoyed the most. My husband and I were laughing about how the actress who played the wife had the best part. She got to play comatose the whole movie! OH to get paid to nap! I would not watch this movie again and I will be giving away the DVD.
0307716546|4.0|AFTERWARDS is a wonderfully written book about a mother's love for her growing children.  I will admit it is a bit daunting to read a book seen through the eyes of an out-of-body mother's experience...which is part of the intrigue of the story.  Gracie, the mother, is brought to the hospital comatose after trying to rescue her teenage daughter trapped in a school fire.  The daughter is also brought to the same hospital with severe burns that have caused internal injuries.  There is a younger brother who has been traumatized by the event, a devoted husband-father and an aunt who is a police officer trying to investigate the school fire.  So now you know there is a mystery to solve and much devotion within the family.  The book came from Amazon and I will be looking for others by Rosamund Lupton who is a a master at writing.  A great read for sure.[[ASIN:0307716546 Afterwards: A Novel]]
B0049985XW|5.0|This amazing story about greed, based on a story by J.B. Traven give us a perspective of how greed and the lust for gold can do to us. An american citizen without money nor job nor home, Hobbs, (played wonderfully by Humphrey Bogart)goes in a gold race after being cheated with a false work and payment promise. In theory, how much gold could be enough for you? When you finally found it, could you stop the quest or you would go for more? Actually, I believe everybody got a number in the head, but when the team finds gold at last (and after a long and difficult journey)Hobbs starts suspecting of his partners, becomes paranoid and hostile with them. Sees a complot against him when there's nothing like that, in fact, the experienced gold digger has seen this before, and he knows what gold can do to men.<br />In a twist of the story, he is not satisfied with the gold he's got, he also wants his partners'. He loses the mental sanity, the friendship he had with his partners, the gold, and the life. I won't tell the irony of the end 'cause I don't want to spoil the surprise for those who haven't seen the film, but as my grandfather used to say: \\"when the gold is not for you, it doesn't matter how much you work for it, you won't get it\\".
B007MLDC2I|1.0|Movie never uploaded properly...could not watch it. ended up getting another movie from competitor. Very disappointed in amazon quality when having friends over to see it.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Imagine Bear Grylls turned into a modern Artemis and thrown in the midst of a love triangle with less zest (if that's even possible) than the other famous/infamous love triangle in the young adult genre (you know, the one that has furries, bloodsuckers and sparkles) and you'll have a fair picture of what \\"The Hunger Games\\" is all about. Lots of survival without any actual survival tricks, some hacking and slashing scenes cut short, loads of angst-driven interior monologue in a rather tame dystopia (if one dares compare this to \\"A Brave New World\\", \\"1984\\" or even \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", that is) and some rather interesting twists and turns which fall somewhat short in the end. A promising setting, a likable main character in the first book turned into a borefest in the sequels due to the pendulating nature of the said love triangle, a few dei ex machina which make you go \\"yeah, right...!\\" a number of times and least, but not last, the undeveloped and underused dystopian setting which, I humbly believe, could've provided a much stronger driving force behind the story than the oh-so-overused \\"they're evil and we must fight back the tyranny\\" card. All in all, blockbuster material, but don't expect to have quotes lying all over your desk after reading it.
B002N2P1SE|3.0|I really like Joss Whedon usually, this is an exception.  The premise has a huge amount of promise but the characters are unlikeable.  The inconsistencies in characters and the plot make it mediocre at best.  I really just find it hard to connect with a show that has no one that I can relate to.  Check out Buffy, now that's a good show.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|cheap book worth the price.  the characters are somewhat simplistic and some pieces of the plot hard to believe but overall an OK read.  perhaps if I read more in the series the overall plot will develop more clarity and believability.  unfortunately I find it hard to motivate to read more of this series, but perhaps on the next rainy day.  not  awful but not great either.  kind of mediocre like reading a newspaper not something you will think on forever but fills the time and perhaps generates a few random thoughts.<br /><br />Overall it was consistency gaps that made me rate the book lower.  Even if they were being controlled the machinists would have moved from machine lifts to elevators  quickly. Control systems would have taught a rudimentary electronics to many and hacking into the radio system would have been common.  The cleaning ritual seemed overally resource heavy where other rituals could have sufficed without the drain.  Control of all knowledge and squelching of even rumors of truth was also hard to swallow.  If you can take this suspension of disbelief not a bad novel of dystopian future albeit depressing  I did find myself fantasizing about who were the original builders, white spremissists, fascists, black separatists, moslem fanatics, fundamentalist believers, cult followers,  ....???
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cool awesome childhood all over love it<br />awe inspiring must get game lots of fun need five more words yeah
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book from the beginning, despite Ms. Gilbert's obvious character flaws (which she herself admits to). I especially enjoyed the first section, having been to Italy. It made me hungry all the time! The section about India was kind of boring and she seemed so incredibly self-centered during this section that I started to become annoyed. The section centered in Bali was enjoyable, but she still came off as being really in love with herself. Everyone has their issues, but the author's became a bit of an obstacle. Overall though, I did enjoy this book and found myself smiling frequently.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|One of the saddest things was seeing this movie stumble upon theatrical release. NOT because it was a bad, poor, or even mediocre film. It is a wonderful film. There are other forces including mere human psychology that affect the marketplace. John Carter was an unfortunate victim of these forces and did not have an opportunity to succeed at the box office the way it deserved to. The DVD will be a second chance to enjoy a truly fine entertainment, and an amazing accomplishment. Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud. Director Stanton and all those folks who had a vision should hold their heads high.

B0087URXZU|5.0|Just buy it.<br /><br />A great compilation of what's on Joe Walsh's  mind today.<br /><br />Great production (kudos to Jeff Lynne) and a great<br /><br />gathering of some mighty fine musicians<br /><br />(like Ringo Starr, just to name one).
B005BDZN62|5.0|West Side Story is absolutely a classic musical. A retelling of Romeo and Juliet set in 1950s New York City, I was singing along to many of the songs without much trouble at all. They are well known songs, found in so much of our modern culture. Seeing this movie is an absolute must in order to understand a wealth of references in books, movies, and TV shows.<br /><br />There are so many aspects to the story that stand out. The \\"local\\" gang is against the outsider Puerto Ricans - but it turns out that the locals are actually made up of Irish, Polish, and other immigrants which only a generation ago would have been the outsiders. Where most movies of this nature would be all-guys-all-the-time, the women in the story are as just as powerful, working in the sweatshop, striving to form a new life where their independence is valued.<br /><br />Where other musicals of the time could be sickly-sweet, West Side Story tackles some important issues head-on. The characters lay out arguments about why they are misunderstood - and then turn the argument around to look at it from all angles. Amazingly, there's even a near-gang-rape of one of the female characters, showing how powerful the \\"not-us\\" mentality could get.<br /><br />This definitely is a movie that you could watch repeatedly and see new subtleties in it each time. The way the characters relate to each other, how they change over time, and how they either listen to or ignore influences from others is well done.<br /><br />It's surprising to me that for many of these actors this was their one shining moment on the screen. I would have thought many of these individuals would go on to star in numerous other movies. This seemed to have become a \\"perfect moment\\" where the cast worked well together.<br /><br />If I had to look for one thing to single out as being less-than-perfect, it would be Russ Tamblyn's dubbed singing in his intro song. We start the movie knowing it's a musical. So we expect stellar singing. Russ is a fantastic dancer and gymnast - I'm still in awe at some of his movies - but his voice wasn't up to the standards the others set. So they brought in Tucker Smith to sing his lines - and even Smith's voice wasn't up to the challenge! If they were going to completely dub the song anyway, why couldn't they find the best singer possible to do that song? I wish a vocal coach had spent more time with Smith, so that the intro sets that pitch-perfect note that leads us into the rest of the magnificence.<br /><br />Still, that is the only down side I could say about a must-watch film.antastic dancer and gymnast - I'm still in awe at some of his movies - but his voice wasn't up to the standards the others set.

B000022TSY|5.0|What an interesting movie. Apparently Easy Rider gets its primary kudos, and placement on the AFI top 100 list at spot 88, for being a fully independent movie. It was one of the first to really make inroads in the high-power movie system. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda pretty much made this movie on their own, funded it, and then filmed themselves riding motorcycles across the US.<br /><br />The motorcycles are now iconic, although one has to wonder with their tiny gas tanks just how often the characters would have had to stop for gas on their cross-country trip through some fairly empty wastelands.<br /><br />Much of the movie is full of the gorgeous scenery of the United States. Having driven many of these roads myself, I found myself remembering those trips fondly while watching the movie, and wishing I could go back and take those trips again. The beauty of Monument Valley and other locations is brought vividly to life. In many ways it's a celebration of the wild range of landscapes.<br /><br />There are also a variety of cultures shown here, which is equally interesting. Yes, we get the hippie commune of \\"city-folk\\" men and women trying their best to live off the dry, dusty land. We see small-town deep south, where the teen girls are intrigued by the strangers and the men-folk are threatened. There are the prostitutes of New Orleans, the quiet farmer and his family, and more. Everyone has their own view on life and what it means to live.<br /><br />This is definitely a \\"guy's film\\". Nearly all women who appear are nameless and are there to ogle or idolize the men. The only two women who seem to talk more than a word are two are the two prostitutes in New Orleans, who go on a long acid trip with the guys. Most of their \\"talk\\", though, is wild ramblings due to the drugs.<br /><br />Some say that this is a 60s ode to the glory of drugs. I don't see that. If anything, it seems to show that their path of freedom didn't lead to joy. One of the characters sighs, near the end, that \\"we blew it.\\" He praised the farmer who had a wife, a family, and a quiet homestead where he was able to live off the grid. That is praised as being of value. The commune is poked at for being unrealistic - they plant seed into dry sand. The LSD trip, far from being shown as fun and color-filled, is shown as scary and dangerous.<br /><br />A great movie to see at least once, since there are so many other movies, TV shows, and novels that reference scenes in this and expect watchers to be familiar with what is going on. It's also a powerful glimpse into time, to see the forces that were at work in the US in the late 60s.he end, that \\"we blew it.\\" He praised the farmer who had a wife, a family, and a quiet homestead where he was able to live off the grid.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is definently worth downloading! It is a lot of fun and very addicting. The only bad thing is the lag.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I know the movie didn't do well at the box office but if you had seen it, you would have enjoyed it. I think the production and direction were very good. A lot of effort went into this movie and it shows on the screen. If there is a flaw, it is that it may have been too ambitious by trying to put in too many plot points. They could have saved the journey down the Issus river for a sequel. The main actor did well but maybe he just doesn't have the screen presence to bring off such a iconic character. Dejah Thoris was great and so were most of the other actors in their roles. The Blu-ray/DVD is very good with interesting extras. Its too bad there probably will not be a sequel. It would be great to follow the whole arc with the Gods of Mars.

0792845668|5.0|This movie is for those of us who remember Moon Unit Zappa.  To those who say it's badly acted, hey, I was a Valley Girl, and I KNEW guys like this.  Seriously, I was looking for a video relevent to junior high history on this last week of school.  This went over as well as Rise of the Planet of the Apes did for my science students.  The kids actually watched in silence, and asked questions about the characters.  Aside from one mildly profane word, there is nothing objectionable to worry about with respect to parents or administrators.  Give it a try.

0525478817|5.0|Goodness! This is going to be one of those gushing reviews where not a lot is said about plot, but much will be said about why you should read it. Let me jump right in.<br /><br />This book is about cancer. Specifically, two teens living with cancer. One teen, Hazel Grace is not doing as well as she probably could be, but she knows, as well as her family, that her days are numbered and that the BIG day will come. Augustus Waters is this beyond beautiful guy that Hazel meets at support group. He's like no other boy she's ever met and he sees in her, what no one has seen in her before. Life. Hazel Grace, even in her weakened state, exudes life and this is what makes Augustus (Gus) fall head-over-heels in love with her. The two form a bond that is both heartbreaking and joyous. They know that their relationship cannot go on forever, and yet... they live as if it will.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />This is such a lovely book and if you had told me a month ago that I would be gushing over a book about cancer, I would have given you my \\"You've got to be kidding!\\" look and not given it a second thought but this book is AMAZING in so many ways. Although these characters never hide from their illness, the story itself is incredibly positive and life affirming and while reading it, it felt so good to be alive. Everything seemed more beautiful to me and that is why this book is so amazing. I'd close the book and drive home and even traffic seemed special to me or the bird singing outside my window seemed more important than the day before. It just made me feel good.<br /><br />The other thing that blew my mind was how much I loved these characters. Hazel and Augustus are these awesome kids that you can't help but love. They are flawed in that they never realize just how wonderful they are but their love is so pure and so genuine that I shed many a tear while reading the book and I dreaded the end. When I finally turned that last page, I wanted to go right back to the beginning and start all over again just so I could spend more time with them. Such a beautiful story and so well done. I borrowed this copy but now I want a copy of my own.<br /><br />I know it's difficult to gather up the courage to read a book about cancer, but seriously, you won't be sorry. In fact, you'll be so glad you did, that you'll come back here and tell me so.nd start all over again just so I could spend more time with them. Such a beautiful story and so well done.

140053271X|4.0|I have had my nook for about 6 months now, and in terms of the product quality, I am fully satisfied. The interface doesn't have the ease of use that I was expecting, but I have only ever used apple touchscreen products so I suppose I had set the bar a bit too high. The only thing that actually bothers me is the lack of control of the organization of the shelves, but it's not so bad. In terms of durability, I was happy to see that the product holds up well, and hasn't broken. I also like the way it feels to read on the nook, it doesn't give me a headache and is actually easier than a normal book. All of that being said, I haven't used my nook since about three months ago. I had begun to read and buy books, and though I enjoyed reading on the nook, I realized that I liked having a physical book, and watching my book collection expand on the shelf. With the books I owned on the nook, it hardly even felt like I owned them. It was just a file. Because of this, I haven't bought any more ebooks, and thus haven't really had a reason to use my nook. Once my local library has a better selection of ebooks available, I think I would begin to use it more. But I would only recommend this product if your library has a good selection of ebooks, or if you don't mind not owning a physical book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the sample and knew I wanted to keep reading more. I decided to purchase the book, after all, it five dollars isn't too bad for a best sellter. Once I began I was hooked. I read the whole book within two days. I couldn't put it down. I liked the actions scenes and enjoyed how I became nervous, almost holding my breath, whenever something exciting or action-filled was happening. I don't usually read anything other than romance. I could usually predict what I'm reading and know who the main character will end up with, that could get pretty boring. It's not like that with Hunger Games. There's a slight love story but that's not the main part of the story. There's so much more and I enjoyed it a lot. I'm glad I purchased this book. It's definetly something I could come back to and re-read sometime in the future.
B0086700CM|5.0|They got it for kindle. It was worth the wait. This is one of the best games I've played before.

Shows the true face of pearl jam the good,the bad and the ugly moments the band and its members had, and if you already love them you'll end up liking them even more. An awesome movie not just in a musical level but well achieved through it all. Pearl Jam, there is more to it than meets the eye, and most of it is presented to us in this incredible documentary.<br />LONG LIVE PJ!!

B007Y1S2HQ|4.0|Rumer's sophomore CD comprises covers of songs by male acts like Hall & Oates, Todd Rundgren, Stephen Bishop, to mention a few. Much like her debut, the album has a classic seventies sound with her clear strong vocals doing the collection justice.<br /><br />The lush piano-sprinkled \\"It Could Be the First Day\\" sounds like something from the Carpenters. As does the similar dreamy \\"Be Nice To Me\\". \\"Soulsville\\" is Blues-tinged, \\"The Same Old Tears On A New Background\\" is a spare piano/guitar ballad, her treatment of \\"Sara Smile\\" while not too far from the original, is absolutely enchanting, while closing cut \\"We Will\\" is a tender quivery beautiful ballad.<br /><br />Despite there being highlights, this is an album better appreciated as a whole. Harmonically rich, filled with lush strings and delicate piano and guitar sequences. For those that love seventies Elton John, The Carpenters, and other such great music.
B0086700CM|5.0|Absolutely love this game!!!! It keeps the kids occupied too.......I can easily. pass time when I'm bored or when I'm in a waiting room.
B007P6VM4A|4.0|My introduction to Swedish Garage Rockers The Hives was on their raw boisterous rocker \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" and I was sold. Their new CD opens with \\"Come On\\", a rocker comprising of little more than the lead vocalist Pelle Almqvist shouting \\"Come On\\" repeatedly which leaves you wanting more as it is rather brief. Prepare for blistering guitar riffs, frenetic beats and shouty vocals, example lead-off single \\"Go Right Ahead\\" (which lifts the hook from ELO's \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\"), the retro sounding \\"Wait A Minute\\", the Dance/Rock \\"Take Back The Toys\\", or the frenetic pair of \\"These Spectacles Reveal The Nostalgics\\" and \\"If I Had A Cent\\".<br /><br />The band attempt to introduce some diversity to their sound. \\"I Want More\\" finds the band in spoken/sung mode against a groovy mid tempo handclap-laced backdrop and buzzing guitars - my favourite. The organ-sprinkled ballad \\"Without The Money\\" has a Bluesy feel, the pounding \\"My Time Is Coming\\" has a dark dramatic feel, while closing the collection is the pulsing \\"Midnight Shifter\\". Hard rocking fun!

B000005H3M|5.0|I just watched the DVD Making Of Burning For Buddy: A Tribute To Buddy Rich.  A lot of highly respected drummers came to play and pay homage to Buddy.  I knew Buddy was a great drummer but their insight on this DVD added even more to my appreciation for his talents.  Watching this program caused me to dig out my copy of Big Swing Face and revisit it.  The music is simply amazing.  The band is on fire and Buddy is cooking!  He always gave 110% and it came through on these recordings. After you listen to the CD, make sure you track down some of the online video clips and watch this guy in action.  The sound on the CD is amazing, but actually seeing what he does with a drum set is unbelievable.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|WOW! Is one word to sum up this amazing 2nd installment to The Mortal Instruments Series. I, in a way was very lucky to have discovered this series late, meaning I started the first one, only a few months, or so, before the 3th was due out. SO when I got hooked, I was able to download the rest, and keep reading. This one was also \\"on the edge of your seat\\" amazing. Then the 4th was not long for me to wait after that.<br /><br />So first, the really good thing about Cassandra Clare is she does a fine job of taking rich and varied and well known mythologies and giving them a brand new spark of life that has not been written into the ground already. I enjoy that she picks bits of mythology from all over and uses it to create a world full of truths and half-truths and the people who have to deal with it all. This isn't just another fantasy novel.<br /><br />After the last explosive and personally upsetting ending of the first book I could only hope that this book would correct that. Unfortunately I was left with many more questions by the end. But that is the way it is with series of books.<br /><br />Sometimes the next book in a series doesn't live up to its predecessor. Not the case with City of Ashes. This book is just as well written and will have you reading the whole book in one.<br /><br />I recommend that you start with City of Bonesif you haven't read it already. If you have well you won't be disappointed with the City of Ashes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and the whole series. Its AMAZING!<br /><br />You should also check out her other series, that is prequel to this one, called The Infernal Devices<br />go check out my blog for more reviews, and other extras, my link is at my profile
0871404133|3.0|I'm not a biologist, but I have taken an amateur interest in this subject for 20+ years. So I was able to follow the discussions in the book, but they ended up leaving me confused. I followed this up by reading the NATURE article which is referred to several times in the book as being the \\"mathematical proof\\" or the argument he is making.<br /><br />It's just not clear exactly what Wilson is doing, but I think it's essentially a bait-and-switch. He takes a very narrow definition of \\"eusocial\\" and \\"inclusive fitness\\" and argues that inclusive fitness is not the best predictor of eusocial behavior. Then he suddenly makes sweeping conclusions about all of social behavior and altruism, claiming that inclusive fitness explains none of it. This is like saying: \\"Sheila is not a man, therefore no men exist.\\" Um, what???<br /><br />I think that in general the concept behind inclusive fitness (which is to say that if we help out our relatives then we help spread our own genes, because our relatives also share our genes) is not only valid but necessary to explain why social species (such as humans) can be the product of natural selection. And this book doesn't disprove that! Wilson has been sidetracked by a particular question about how certain types of bees evolved to be eusocial and lost sight of the big picture.<br /><br />Furthermore, he keeps talking about how he \\"mathematically proved\\" that inclusive fitness doesn't work, but I just read his NATURE paper and I sure wasn't convinced of that. Nor were the literally hundreds of other authors who wrote replies to his NATURE article, most of which said essentially the same thing that I just said in this review.<br /><br />All that having been said, the book is still a very interesting and useful description of how social behavior interacts with natural selection. If he hadn't spent so much time trying to draw what seemed to be a meaningless distinction between inclusive fitness and what he dubs the \\"standard model\\" of group selection, then it would have been a more understandable and useful book for the non-specialist reader.<br /><br />I will also note that toward the end of the book he goes on some wild tangents, such as why religion is an outgrowth of the evolutionary pressures of social living. I think he nails this perfectly (although he isn't the first to do so), but he knows this explanation is almost certain to be instantly rejected by religious readers. So I'm not sure why he bothered to include it in the book.<br /><br />He also talks a bit about environmentalism and even his assertion that we should give up wasting money on manned space exploration because robot probes could do better space science. I think he fears the idea that we may feel like we can just use up the resources of the Earth and move away to somewhere else, so he wants to stop all such activity. (But if we are never going to leave the Earth, why bother sending out the robot probes anyway?)<br /><br />All in all it is a book with a lot of really good information in it, as well as some very interesting speculation. But the speculation and the information are just a bit too muddled together, making it hard to be sure where one ends and the other begins. This is a serious flaw in a science book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Per the author's request at the end of the Omnibus edition, I am posting a review here on Amazon to express how satisfying this book/series has been.<br /><br />With a couple of minor exceptions, I was always immersed in the story and the characters.  It starts out interesting, and as the world around the first characters you meet is revealed, a bleaker and bleaker picture begins to emerge.  The author leaves you guessing as to the true nature of the world the characters inhabit...and only over the course of the 5 parts will the entire picture become clear.  Some foreshadowing can certainly be found, but he doesn't beat you over the head with it.  Somewhere in book 2, the meaning of the title became clear...a clever allusion based on a clever illusion. (pardon me...I couldn't resist)<br /><br />The only two minor things that I didn't care for were simply nitpicks about the physics related in the story. Mr. Howey, if you'd like to discuss them, I'd be happy to email you.  (hint: one has to do with underwater and the other with temperature)<br /><br />I can highly recommend the book(s) if you are a sci-fi fan...or even simply enjoy dystopic stories of any bent.  My next read will be the recently published prequel...I can't wait to find out the history and background of the world we find in Wool.

B000002L9M|2.0|Kind of a strange album:  indisputably from DM's prime, but doesn't contain any of the songs DM is known for.  It's almost as though it's one of those dreary compilation albums consisting of B-sides, although it's not presented that way.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I didn't start watching Breaking Bad until about a month ago: I bought Season 1 on DVD just on a whim. I had heard good things about it, so I figured \\"why the hell not?\\" Long story short and 4 sleep-deprived days later, I had gone through the first 3 seasons. This show may actually be too good. It's so riveting that it causes \\"users\\" to lose inordinate amounts of sleep. I literally sit up on my couch and sometimes just crouch there because I am actually on the edge of my seat (this is not a figure of speech in this scenario).<br /><br />To get to my point about Season 4 now: I have been streaming the first few episodes on Amazon Instant Video on my PS3. The only problem is that my bandwidth is not fast enough to stream seamlessly. Does that stop me? NO. I sit there and agonize through the all-too-frequent pauses just to grasp another nugget of this gold mine of a drama. The acting is sublime. The story is phenomenal. And the cinematography is stellar. I made it through 5 episodes on the crappy streaming, but guess what...TODAY IS MY LUCKY DAY!!! It is out on DVD now. I think you know what I'll be doing after work today. That's right. Probably watching the remainder of the season in one sitting.<br /><br />If you don't like this show, there is no hope for you.

B007RX32TY|5.0|Chromatics might sound like a color scheme to most, but if you've watched cool-headed, stuntman turned hero film Drive, then there's no doubt that your ears have experienced the smooth, analog-textured synth pop of Portland's very own. With their most recent 90-minute release, Kill For Love, Chromatics have soared into the indie scene as one of the leaders of the new Italo disco movement, formulating a sound combining vintage 80s synthesizers and arpeggiators layered with crisp guitar melodies and backing bass. With a heavy presence of reverb, the dreamy yet chilling voice of Ruth Radelet, and a constant loop of a classic crackle and pop from an old vinyl, Kill For Love is their most visionary effort to date. While tracks such as \\"The Page\\" and \\"Back from the Grave\\" standout as the most poppy and major-chord oriented, it's the 8-minute instrumental, \\"Broken Mirrors,\\" that loses you in its cryptic, steadily rising mix of single note strings and thickly stroked guitar sections. Composed and engineered by Glass Candy's Johnny Jewel, who has been on the Chromatics lineup for the past two albums, Kill for Love will keep any synth lover yearning for more.<br /><br />By Joe Davies

B0074MZSWW|5.0|Anyone who claims that rock and roll ain't what it used to be clearly hasn't heard of these stunning musicians. Straight out of Alabama, southern rock quartet Alabama Shakes has been making uproar with their unique fusion of blues, classic rock and a hard edge of soul. Probably the most compelling quality of this band is how seamlessly they stay true to their pure, old school sound while keeping their music relevant to today's listeners. Formed in high school, front lady Brittany Howard and bassist Zac Cockrell started meeting after class to write and play songs. What first started as classic rock covers turned into original tunes. After the drummer, Steve Johnson, and guitarist, Heath Fogg, were added to the Shakes, extreme popularity ensued. Howard's shrill and powerful vocals are not only dripping with soul, but they evoke massive emotions that really give you a feel for her as a person. Tracks \\"Hold On,\\" \\"Rise to the Sun,\\" and \\"Heavy Chevy\\" not only showcase Howard's voice, but also the raw energy and musicianship of the band.<br /><br />By Grayson Sandford

0345803485|1.0|I'm no stranger to sexually explicit books and I am not impressed at all with this book. No plot, just sex, and that, not well-written at all.<br /><br />I'm sure it's on the best-seller list because a couple teenaged girls thought it was \\"so hot\\" and then everybody had to read it. This is a major slap in the face to real authors who try to get their work published.<br /><br />Maybe if there weren't so many immature outbursts throughout every sex scene, it might be okay. \\"Holy sheet\\" \\"Holy crop\\" \\"Holy funk\\" \\"Oh my\\" \\"How hot\\". Every.funking.where.throughout.the.book. Very, very irritating.<br /><br />This book was obviously written by a teenager who has never had a real orgasm in their life, who was creating their own personal fantasy, because it's all about Christian's pleasure. All they do is funk. He never takes the time to please his woman orally, but he sure makes her do plenty of it to him. He makes it a point to describe \\"the length of him\\" and \\"his giant rod\\" yet calls hers, \\"down there\\". Really?<br /><br />I got to the third chapter and tossed it into the trash. I wouldn't even waste a friend's time with this drivel. Give me Judith Krantz any day for sex scenes done right, and without the cheerleader turning 50 shades of crimson, and biting her lip. Jeez.

B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have been using this for the past week and here is my input:<br />A. I was looking for a speaker that will connect to at least 2 phones, will play the audio loud and clear and will allow the other party to hear me clearly.<br />B. I don't care about getting a voice notification for the caller or using this with two phones at the same time.<br /><br />My experience so far:<br />A. Easy to place on the sun visor with the magnetic clip. This is extremely useful if you don't want to leave it in the car at certain areas.<br />B. The device is compact.<br />C. The buttons are relatively easy to use. It takes some time to remember where each is located so you can operate it without looking at it. The most problematic is the end conversation button which is not in a unique position such as the answer call.<br />D. Pairing was easy, but I used the option in which the phone did the discovery of the speaker. There is an option for the speaker to look for the phone, but I did not try that.<br />E. It remembers the two phones and connects to them automatically.<br />F. The rang is good, meaning that the phone does not stay paired when you move away from your car.<br />G. Sound is perfect. Even when driving 110 KM/H in my small car the other side hears me perfectly and I can hear them easily.<br /><br />I can't say much for the battery so far. All in all, I feel this was a good purchase and recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I must say that I was skeptical at first.  I am not an avid reader but do enjoy a good \\"page-turner.\\"  I had heard a lot of buzz about these books and kept ignoring it until I couldn't go anywhere without someone bringing up \\"50 Shades of Grey.\\"  I decided to read the \\"sample\\" provided by Kindle and before I could get through the sample I had downloaded the whole book because I knew I wouldn't want to stop reading.  I started the triolgy on late Thursday evening and finished book three of the triolgy by the following Monday morning.  I could not put the book down!  I found myself reading until 2 a.m. until I couldn't hold my eyes open any longer.  I would start reading and wouldn't want to stop even to go to the bathroom. I got so attached to the characters, especially Christian...and ALL of his issues.  And since I've finished the books, I find myself wanting more...I miss Fifty!  I'm ready for books 4, 5 and 6!  If you haven't read these books and are on the fence like I was, just buy the first one and you won't be disappointed!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what being a zombie killing samurai was like, this game is it.  Fun gameplay and hardly any ads, fun free game.
0345803485|1.0|With all the talk going on about these \\"amazing\\" books, I just had to pick them up to see what all the fuss was about.  I read all three books, and by the end was more intrigued by the mystery of how these books became so popular rather than the oh-so-mysterious Christian Grey.<br /><br />I see the appeal of the main male character.  He's rich, powerful, confident, young, handsome.  And not to mention he's so amazing in bed that he can cause girls to orgasm even in their dreams.  The main female character on the other hand is a bit clumsy and insecure and hasn't been truly swept off her feet by a man.  As a lady, I can relate and absolutely see what has everyone so drawn to these characters.<br /><br />The plot line of the book is weak.  Outside of Christian and Ana's constant petty drama, the author seemed to have a hard time keeping up with a consistent plot line.  Every chapter some new \\"exciting\\" event is occurring, and then it fizzles out into nothing to make way for the next dull adventure.  And the writing is painfully repetitive.  The same words and phrases are used over and over and over and over.  You can easily skip sections and never feel like you missed out on a single bit of useful information.<br /><br />The relationship the two characters have is very unhealthy and filled with more pointless drama than a reality TV show.  I suppose if you want to get swept away in an unrealistic book about a billionaire who has a very questionable and unhealthy past, who enjoys hitting women, who's a psychotic stalker, who wants to control your every waking move, and who says absolutely crazy things to you so you won't leave him then this would be the book for you.  I happen to prefer my men to come with a little less baggage.  And my books to come with a little more thought and effort.
0553801473|4.0|What the negative (and often hilarious) reviews of this book failed to capture for me is the fact that I found this much, much better than A Feast for Crows.  I suppose it's mainly that Crows was so unrelentingly dark. Plus you had to listen to @#$@# Cersei.  Ick. This is less dark, with little bits of hope, and even the detestable character (Reek) becomes moderately likable.<br /><br />(Spoiler, but trying to be vague:) There are two plot twists mid-book where characters who ended Crows badly suddenly get a better deal. Doing the two in sequential chapters was unconvincing.  It left me annoyed wondering, \\"Is anything else you led us to believe totally wrong, George?\\"<br /><br />Now how many years do we have to wait for the next one?

B007IGG0IA|4.0|Florence + the Machine's 2009 debut album \\"Lungs\\" was immediately well received by both critic and the general public alike, rocketing Florence Welsh into the stratosphear. The band's second, even more ambitious, album, last year's \\"Ceremonials\\" was another hit. Towards the end of last year, the band recorded this unplugged set in an intimate setting, and that was released in April, 2012.<br /><br />\\"MTV Unplugged\\" (11 tracks; 48 min.) of course relies heavily on songs from the \\"Ceremonials\\" album, starting here off also with that album's opener \\"Only If For a Night\\". As can be expected from an unplugged set, the band sounds less aggressive, and much quieter, than on the studio albums. That leaves yet more room than ever for Florence to showcase her vocal capabilities. Check the beautiful and powerful a capella opening of \\"Drumming Song\\". Besides the 6 songs on here from \\"Ceremonials\\", there are several from the first album, and when Florence kicks off \\"Dog Days Are Gone\\" towards the end, it gets a bigger crowd reaction than any other song on here. This contains also two nice covers: Otis Reading's \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" and, even better, Johnny Cash/June Carter's \\"Jackson\\".<br /><br />In all, quite the collection of music! I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of \\"Ceremonials\\", I personally still find that \\"Lungs\\" is the more consistent album, but this collection brings the songs from \\"Ceremonials\\" in a way that I appreciate them more. I had the good fortune of seeing Florence + the Machine in concert at the 2010 Coachella music festival, just as they were getting bigger in the US, and I was floored by the stage presence of Florence Welsh. It was clear to anyone there that she and her band would only get bigger and better. Meanwhile, this unplugged collection is a winner and highly recommended!
B002UNMW7O|4.0|Now to some of you who saw this movie, maybe it's not as good as the first one. Or maybe you hated it.

B0087UN94E|3.0|Hours after Neil Young and his new bandmates (CS&N) left the stage at Woodstock in 1969, Jimi Hendrix closed out that historic concert with his smoldering rendition of the national anthem. Neil later paid homage to Jimi with his grunge version of \\"Where the Buffalo Roam,\\" in the movie of the same title, that featured Bill Murray doing a (pre-Johnny Depp) imitation of Hunter Thompson. Like Jimi's \\"Anthem,\\" Neil's was a reimagining of a familiar American folk song that pulled it up by the roots that gave it contemporary meaning. (Perhaps this is why Sha Na Na, who played in between CSN&Y and Jimi that day, is referenced here with \\"Get A Job,\\" the least congruous tune on this disc--it have fit in better on his \\"Neil and the Shocking Pinks\\" CD). Neil periodically revisits his roots, often by getting \\"back to the country,\\" covering classics like \\"Oh, Lonesome Me,\\" \\"Four Strong Winds\\" and \\"The Wayward Wind.\\" On this album, he reminds us of those lyrics on his solo debut--\\"I used to be a folksinger...\\"<br /><br />Although some may be disappointed by the fact there are no new Neil compositions on this record, it is good to see him get back on the Horse again and behold them riding in all their ragged glory. One of my favorite live NY shows of all time was Neil and Crazy Horse \\"In a Rusted Out Garage\\" at San Fransico's Cow Palace in 1986. Perhaps they will hook a whole new generation of fans when they headline Outside Lands in Golden Gate Park this summer. Yet I suspect most of the people who purchase this record now will be fans already, especially guitarists anxious to hear what Neil does tearing through these familiar tunes in his unique style. Like other Neil/Horse collaborations, grunge tends to dominate here--only \\"Wayfarin' Stranger\\" is given the acoustic treatment. The disc is topped off by the transplanted Candadian's grunge tribute to the queen. This brings us full circle back to 1969--the same year Jimi closed out Woodstock with his Anthem, the Beatle's closed outAbbey Road with \\"Her Majesty.\\" Neil's homage to HRH would fit in well on the set-list of those UK punk bands that would re-energize rock and roll after the Woodstock flame had dimmed.<br /><br />I gave this CD 3 stars because it is a middling effort by Neil, but is still better than much of what passes for music these days. I was reminded of a few other \\"back to the roots\\" efforts by rockers from Neil's era, such as Eric Clapton's Robert Johnson tribute CD. And both Neil and Clapton played at \\"Bobfest,\\" where various artists from the many traditions that influenced (and who were influenced BY) Dylan gathered to honor him. But the closest analogy seems to be the 2008 effort by fellow Bay Area icon Paul Kantner, who assembled members of the Jefferson<br />Airplane/Starship cast to update and rework traditional folk songs on \\"Jefferson's Tree of Liberty.\\" That work, as Neil's newest is likely to become, was \\"polarizing\\" for fans--while some saw it as a solid effort to revisit the roots, others viewed it as mere \\"coasting\\" in the absence of new material. But artists like Neil, Dylan, the Airplane and the Dead owed much to traditional folk music like that presented on \\"Americana.\\"

B003Y5HWJU|1.0|I have to agree with Demosthenus's review.  I was excited by the high reviews for this series and that millions had been allegedly spent on the production making it the best show out there.  However, I was very disappointed when I started watching this show.  I appreciate a lot of money might have been spent on its production, but for me it just doesnt work.  It doesnt have a feel of reality like many other tv series out there.  It really was like watching a cartoon, very staged 'acting' if you can call it that.  The characters are like cardboard, there is little credible dialogue and script.  The plot is terribly SLOW, I turned off half way through the first episode, as I realised I was wasting valuable 'life' watching this.  However, I did give it another try the next evening and although things did improve fractionally, not much.  After the second episode, I really cant watch anymore of this show.  By the second episode, I'd just had enough of the 'pornography' being expliciting shown almost every scene - totally unnecessary (I hope most of this was cut from the actual tv showing of this series and this amount of flesh was reserved for the dvd).<br /><br />I would not recommend this show to anyone.

B007SGM084|2.0|I read all three books.  The last one was probably the best.  In my opinion these books were OK as a story but I was pretty turned off by the rough stuff.  The books would have been better with more of a story line and less sex, sex, sex.  I haven't bought an \\"erotic\\" book before so I guess that is why all the sex.<br /><br />I'll take a Karen Marie Moning book any day over these, plenty of STORY and plenty of steamy REGULAR romantic sex.<br /><br />Can't imagine why these the top 3 best sellers honestly unless we ladies are just plain curious about them.

B00005JKTF|4.0|I would have to say this movie was worth the purchase.  It had all the wonderful essentials for a darn good movie.  Cate Blannchett gives a wonderful performance in this drama packed show along with many of the other actors.  Well worth the price to have it in your collection.  It's too bad we never heard much about it.

B0076UXKDG|5.0|compared to the grip i purchased for my D90 this grip is a mercedes, the D90 grip was cheap feeling to the touch and cost way to much for that reason I think it was $200 or more when I bought it. this MB-D12 grip came packaged in a nice box like other nikon products and i was surprised to see they gave a nice nylon carry case for the extra AA battery tray. this grip is made out of a nice material that feels much like the camera its self and it adds a good weight to the camera and a functionality you cant pass up. I am a believer in buying parts made by the manufacturer when it comes to things you expect to fit well and perform with OEM functionality. so I would say the opposite of the other reviews and tell you not to wait for some cheap Chinese knock off, you are putting it on you new $3000 camera body do you really want to take a chance putting an electrical devise on it that could fry the circuits, if it was made incorrectly I know I dont want to have to wait for another D800 it might be Christmas before it comes in.

145162445X|4.0|lawrence krauss is a very good writer and clearly very knowledgable.<br />still, \\"something from nothing\\" leaves me less than fully satisfied. it is<br />a fine book if you have a grounding in special and general relativity,<br />quantum physics, the standard model, basic chemistry and cosmology. i<br />don't think it does a great deal for the general intelligent reader<br />without the requisite background. as a non physicist who sometimes teaches these<br />subjects, there is insufficient explanation of the uncertainty principle and the \\"false vacuum\\" which lie at the heart of krauss' explanations. there is also<br />the possibility that dark energy or at least part of dark energy comes from other<br />sources. this is a very good work and well covers the evolution of the universe<br />and the rational for dark matter and dark energy.  i simply wish there had been more<br />explanation for the non scientific reader even at the cost of extending the size of the book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have stuck with my gut and not wasted 9.95 on this book. It was a complete waste of time and space on my kindle. There is virtually no plot and it becomes very boring very fast with the constant sex scenes (and not very good ones at that!)If you like just plain raunchy sex over and over, then read the book....not to mention the overuse of repetative phrases CONSTANTLY! It is definitely not worthy to be called literature...just porn on paper. Oh, and by the way, I just had to quit at 25%...couldn't take another page!
0451209338|3.0|The Kill Artist is like a boilerplate template for Silva's Gabriel Allon spy novels. It has the pieces, basic plot about terror and intrigue of the other novels; however, it lacks the depth, historical intrigue and complexity of what I think are the better novels by Silva.  In the Kill Artist, to stop further terrorist attacks Allon enlists the help of a beautiful cover model to serve as an undercover agent to seduce and trap a terrorist. Meanwhile, the apparently omniscient Ari Shamron plays puppetmaster behind the scenes.  The narrative then woodenly follows this storyline that to me was unappealing, so that I mostly just wanted it to end. The story and conclusion also lack the believability that I have come to expect by Silva who has set the bar high for himself.<br /><br />Overall, this is an adequate spy thriller, but I have come to expect something better from Silva whose books I will continue to read.
B007MAETA8|5.0|For me, Continuum was the first John Mayer album that I really liked all the way through. The follow-up - Battle Studies - was a huge disappointment. Because of this, my expectations for Born and Raised were not so high. That said, Born and Raised is spectacular. It's extremely mellow and done in a 70's folky style. The thing I really like about it, is that rather than changing styles every song, it's almost like a concept album in which the theme doesn't vary much. Rather than go back to the tried and true blues recipe, Mayer took a chance and went in the opposite direction. I couldn't have really conceived of this album from him, but it comes off as totally organic and natural, rather than forced and commercial. In an age of commercialized trash, this is really a breath of fresh air.

0307593312|2.0|I read the first 400 pages. After that I just kind of gave up. It was an interesting concept, and I liked Aomame and the dowager, but everyone else was just boring. Not what I expected, and I doubt I will be reading this author again.
B007Z9QWVK|5.0|Brilliantly Directed!!!!  The ambiance of the movie, settings and all fashion, hair styles and music, swept me away one afternoon to another time.  Onion characters, peel one layer at a time!!  Stunning acting and presence.  This is one movie that should have gotten much more attention!!  The viewer will not be disappointed!!  Thank You \\"A\\" for having this movie!!!!
0307454541|5.0|I watched the movie (Swedish version) before I ever read the book. The movie got me hooked and to be honest, I prefer the movies over the books. The plot is fantastic and full of little twists, with plenty of action and strong characters. I love that many of the females (besides the lead) are strong and powerful in their own way. However, I think the book could have been written better. It gets too wordy at times with too many details that I don't find of interest. Yes, I love having an image in my head of a scene, but sometimes Stieg Larsson's descriptions end up boring me instead of fascinating me. He also puts in many details about government and politics, but that part is understandable. The trilogy is thrilling and action-packed, but it is also a portrayal of corruption and how secrets in government end up harming the citizens the government is supposed to protect.<br /><br />Lisbeth is an amazing character and I guess part of the reason I like her so much is that it's unlikely there's any real person like her out in the world. It's rare that a main character who is so antisocial, socially awkward, and so distant is so likable. You end up cheering her on and supporting her acts of violence because all her life, she has been mistreated and misunderstood. You want her to get her justice. And of course, she gets it done Lisbeth Salander-style. You can't trust the government to properly deliver justice in this case because the leaders in government don't even fully know what's going on.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great trilogy that combines action, crazy characters, and politics. It's a crazy mix but it works.
0307959856|1.0|jane austen did the work of creating and developing characters for her stories. they are not anyone else's characters to write about. this is not a \\"joint effort\\" because jane austen did not collaborate with anyone. create your own characters and write you own book. leave other peoples' intellectual property alone.

B0086T6RW2|5.0|A lot is happening in this episode of Mad Men, all of it heartbreaking and it all makes for one of the best episodes of the season. The race to get the Jaguar account is still on and difficulties abound. The Jaguar continues to be an expensive and unreliable car and the agency hopes to compare it to a mistress, but needs the slogan - a slogan that Don is having trouble creating. One of the Jaguar executives wants Joan's company for an evening, and not as Pete puts it for dinner and dancing. It is right that Pete should define the terms as he is the weasel who pimps and pitches the propisition to Joan. The rest of the men are aghast and don't want Joan to do it but Pete is convinced that this is the only way they will get the account - even if Don comes through with his ususal brilliance. In his stress, Don is lashing out at both Peggy and Megan and Peggy is considering pursuing another opportunity. Megan is hoping she gets a part with an out of town try out.<br /><br />The episode highlights the differences for women and working women in particular without preaching or being heavy-handed. All of the female characters are asked to prostitute themselves in some way, either literal or metaphoric and their femininity is still their defining characteristic to the men in their world, despite what they do and how they function. Don is surprisingly moral and Pete unsurprisingly adds pander to his many slimey accomplishments. Lane is pragmatic and fond of Joan and advises that if forced to sell oneself to get the best possible price and to get it up front. Roger and Cooper are as ineffectual as ever. The editing of Don's pitch and Joan's decision about what to do is a brilliant bit of filming. The depth of Don's feelings for Peggy are finally revealed and end by being as sad as the rest of tonight's show.<br /><br />These characters were never paragons but tonight they all participated in the corruption that would emblematize America as it went forward into the seventies and eighties; they did it for understandable reasons and they remain good but flawed people but the worm is in the apple. A brilliant, brilliant episode that shows us why Mad Men is not only one of the best shows on television but is destined to be remembered as a classic.

0307887448|3.0|What you need to know about me is I'm a computer nerd who graduated high school in '85.  I was role-playing Judge's Guild before the D&D \\"blue box set\\" was even available.  I wrote my first program on a TRS80 and my first dungeon adventure on an Atari 400.  I could whistle the carrier tone of an acoustic MODEM so well I could trick mine into trying to sync.  Love of Devo and Oingo Boingo and John Hughes movies:  check, check and check.  To this day, I can still recite, verbatim, much of the dialog from Conan The Barbarian and Big Trouble In Little China.  Tempest and Joust... wow... don't get me started on how many quarters those games got from me.  I'm going to go out limb here and boast getting just about every 80s pop culture reference in this novel, but even more scary, all of the nerd computer, gaming (role-playing) and video game reference as well.  In other words, I get it... deeply.  And I loved it.  Never before has a movie or book brought back so much fond nostalgia for me, and Ernest Cline absolutely nailed it.  I guessing he and I could trade stories over an afternoon and come away thinking we shared the same childhood in alternate, parallel universes, and in that regard Ready Player One is 5-stars worth of fun.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you don't happen to be a mid-80s alumni who majored in Nerdery, I can't recommend this book because while it's great nostalgia, it's mediocre science fiction at best.  Ironically, while I imagine its most enthusiastic audience will be males 35-45, in many ways Ready Player One reminded me of YA fiction.  The relationships between the main characters are simplistic and juvenile.  Some dire, real-world events are brought up, twice, but the reactions to them are shallow.  In one case (no spoiler), the reaction is essentially \\"sure they died, but they sucked so who cares\\".  In the other case, the reaction is essentially \\"I will avenge you!\\" and that's pretty much it.  The game itself has no consequences aside from you having to roll up a new level 1 toon, so unlike The Matrix, one never feels overly concerned for the \\"heroes\\" and what's going on with them in their virtual world.  So, what's the hook?  Why are we to be concerned if the hero doesn't prevail?  Well, you basically have to get invested in the idea that if the \\"bad guys\\" win, the MMORPG everyone in the world loves will become more commercialized.  Umm... ok... I guess that's bad... ish.<br /><br />So, for me, Ready Player One was a glorious, 6 hour read down Memory Lane.  For most people, however, I think it's going to be a simplistic story about some kid you'll like (when he's not being a dick because he's a kid) against some gamer CEO who's a dick because he's the big, bad businessman who doesn't care if he cheats and kills people.  You will proceed along the plot of this story in a linear, no surprises fashion.  You will never be in doubt how this story will end.  You will not fear for the protagonists.  You will not be challenged to imagine the consequences to humanity of an immersive virtual \\"game\\" played by essentially everyone.  You will get Schoolhouse Rock tunes stuck in your head.<br /><br />I toyed with giving a 2-star review, but decided that wasn't fair.  I did enjoy Ready Player One, and I think people who aren't too demanding of their scifi entertainment will think \\"it's OK\\"... which is the definition of 3-stars according to the rating tool.  Do not, however, come to this book with 5-star expectations because once you discard all the 80s trivia, there's not a whole lot left to recommend.oll up a new level 1 toon, so unlike The Matrix, one never feels overly concerned for the \\"heroes\\" and what's going on with them in their virtual world.

B0088LTXCO|5.0|Matt Weiner, the creator of Mad Men, cites the romanticism of his parents life during the early sixties as inspiration for the setting and tone of Mad Men; the sixties are the edenic time for Weiner and as we approach their end in reality and in the storyline the fall from innocence is inevitable. Our characters and our times are falling in Mad Men and the one criticism to make is that with the heavy thematic emphasis on America's fall from innocence during the sixties and seventies is that the characters of Mad Men, once so strong, are becoming place holders for the theme. That said it is very small criticism indeed as Mad Men remains entrancing, must see television.<br /><br />This week we have several surprises, not all of them pleasant. We open with the discovery by Don of Lane's borrowing of money from the company. Don shows us bits of the old Don for better and for worse as does Roger and everybody expresses dissatisfaction with their lot in life and the fatigue that comes with the constant pursuit of happiness. Happiness that seems to be ever receding, a motif in the dialogue this week. Sally does grown-up girl things but then panics when she gets a surprise. Don does give one child their dearest wish. Megan continues to be drain on the narrative, much like many second wives.<br /><br />All in all a strong to excellent episode of Mad Men and one that sets us up nicely for the series finale next week.

B0055SWM08|5.0|this is one of the best games I have played in a while, this is a very fun puzzle/challenging game.
0440178002|5.0|This book is definitely hard to finish. It's hard to start, too. The beginning is slow, as it introduces everyone in the novel, and there are dozens of characters. But trust me, after you make it about 100 pages in the book becomes the best book you've ever read.<br /><br />This book draws you in like no other. It took me two weeks to read this book, and for two weeks all I thought about was samurai and dutch trading ships and Japanese typhoons. The story is so rich and exciting, all you want to do is read this book. And in the story are some amazing lessons to be learned, if you pay attention.<br /><br />Read this book before you die. You don't havr to read it right away, just save it for a long trip or something. You definitely need to read it.
0756913675|2.0|While the book was new and hardbound as requested, it was not a full sized book.  It also did not have a cover.  I ordered two other Nicholas Sparks books at the same time and they were exactly as I expected and ordered.

B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator have been on a real upward trajectory artistically speaking for the last decade or so. Since 2001's superb Violent Revolution album and the establishment of their current line-up, everything that the band have put out has been of the utmost quality, keeping to a fairly strict but non-intrusive formula and just knocking out a boatload of brilliant songs.<br /><br />Now in 2012, with their thirteenth full-length studio album Phantom Antichrist, the legendary German Thrash Metal band continue in the same vein that has kept the last three albums so absolutely vital and deliver more of the same formula that mixes their classic 1980s style with elements of Gothenburg style, an intermittent touch of groove and a few sections with clean vocals over arpeggiated bits in their too for variety.<br /><br />Each of the albums that follow that aforementioned formula also puts enough of an individual twist on it to have its own identity though, and I guess Phantom Antichrist's twist would be that it isn't just as fast, isn't just as heavy as often and is a lot more focused on the high-end. It's a more melodic and musical take of the Enemy Of God/Hordes Of Chaos musical direction.<br /><br />Despite the title track leading with speed and low end, there's a lot of time given on the album overall to slow sections, little guitar vibratos, teasing rolls or little sneaky Hi-Hat strikes. If you are all about the Thrash side of things don't worry though, it isn't as if the band abandoned Thrash, there is a heck of a lot of it in there too. The band did a clever job of balancing mixing things up with keeping what was working well.<br /><br />I have nothing but praise for this album, on first listen it already gave off \\"Album Of The Year Candidate\\" feelings and still grew on me with each subsequent spin. The performance is so energetic and pounding on the heavier songs and so subtle and studied on the more musical moments, the production is absolutely top-rate, Mille's vocals are up to the same standard of the recent few albums and the lead guitar work is inspired as always. Furthermore it is a pretty perfect length and each individual song is excellent so there is nothing in the way of filler. The album is lean, varied and perfectly formed.<br /><br />If this happened to be the first Kreator album that you ever heard I am sure it would leave a damn fine first impression. If you are an existing fan it is definitely more of the same flawless formula that has been working so well on one hand, and yet also a bit of a surprise at the same time, which just helps make it fresh and worthwhile.<br /><br />Highlights include the superb `Death To The World,' which has some brilliant lead guitar work and a surprising mid-section, the proggy closer `Until Our Paths Cross Again' as well as the groovy and complex `The Few The Proud The Broken' and which is exemplary of a few tracks on the album that take some of the spirit of Power Metal festival-pleasing choruses but applies it to a mostly mid-tempo Thrash number.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really great album from a truly consistent and focused band that know how to write good metal songs. The only thing which I could imagine anyone ever finding bad about this album would be the idea of the band repeating themselves, for example there is a riff in `Civilizations Collapse' that sounds like one in `Coma Of Souls' and one in `United In Hate' that sounds like one in `Replicas Of Life' etc but the band pull it off so well it doesn't bother me personally. If you usually find riff-recycling a massive pain then maybe the album won't seem just as flawless as I make it out to be, so that is something to take into consideration.<br /><br />As long as you liked the past few Kreator albums and aren't either sick of them or shocked at something that isn't exactly as heavy as their last two albums even if it makes up for it in other areas however, then Phantom Antichrist should be a no-brainer love affair right from the get-go.<br /><br />In summary; If you want some perfectly crafted German Metal, with absolutely superb lead guitar work, great drum work and the occasional moments of sing-along grandeur or softer moments brushing shoulders with pounding yet intelligent and varied Thrash, then this is certainly worth picking up.<br /><br />*** If you should happen to buy the Special Edition version, you will get one card-sleeve housing two individual digipak cases. The first has the actual album and the second has the bonus DVD.<br /><br />The DVD features a twenty-minute making-of documentary called `Conquerers Of The Ice.' Although it is a making-of there isn't that much in-studio footage, maybe around a total of three minutes. The bulk of the feature is three separate interviews that are cut together with studio footage between cuts. The producer Jens Borgen is interviewed at Fascination Street Studios where the album was recorded, and Mille Petrozza is interviewed on a frozen Ocean, while guitarist Sami Yli-Sirni&ouml; is interviewed in front of a Swedish castle. Topics covered include recording in Sweden, avoiding cheesiness, Osama Bin-Laden's death, the Greek economy and simultaneously tracking all members at once while recording. It isn't the most substantial documentary in the world, but it is a lot better than the one from Hordes Of Chaos.<br /><br />The DVD also features a live concert from Waken Open Air Festival 2011, intercut with four tracks from Waken 2006, but done in a way that you mightn't even notice if it wasn't pointed out to you. This isn't just the live-feed slapped onto a disc however, the footage and sound have been treated, edited and tidied up and it is actually a really good feature. It may cut to the monitors a little too often and not feature all that much off of their 80s albums, but it is a damn fine live show nonetheless.<br /><br />The tracklisting is:<br />1. (Intro) Choir Of The Damned<br />2. Hordes Of Chaos<br />3. War Curse<br />4. Endless Pain (with a riff from Coma Of Souls as an intro)<br />5. Pleasure To Kill<br />6. Destroy What Destroys You<br />7. (Intro) The Patriarch<br />8. Violent Revolution<br />9. People Of The Lie<br />10. Europe After The Rain<br />11. Phobia<br />12. Reconquering The Throne (with a riff from Terrible Certainty as an intro)<br />13. Flag of Hate/Tormentor<br /><br />The concert lasts 53.50 and with the improved visuals is probably actually a better DVD than their Live Kreation Revisioned Glory release. I highly recommend getting this bonus version if you can get it for cheap enough and as long as you enjoyed the Hordes Of Chaos album that makes up a lot of its track listing.  ***e get-go.<br /><br />In summary; If you want some perfectly crafted German Metal, with absolutely superb lead guitar work, great drum work and the occasional moments of sing-along grandeur or softer moments brushing shoulders with pounding yet intelligent and varied Thrash, then this is certainly worth picking up.<br /><br />*** If you should happen to buy the Special Edition version, you will get one card-sleeve housing two individual digipak cases.

B0086700CM|5.0|this app is great, cool, awesome, fun, addictive, and amazing. I give this game a perfect ten and even more.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|Well I havnt bought this box set yet. But it is way cheaper than buying the CD's individually. This will be the only box set I'll buy as the albums after these, while good, are singles with filler. Sorry. These are the difinitive Queen albums with SO much variety from Prog to Metal to ragtime to gospel to pop and just about everything in between. The only Queen albums you reall need. Get the greatest hits rather than the remaining albums.<br />[[ASIN:B004SBB0LU Queen 40 Limited Edition Collector's Box Set]]
B002T3LHG2|2.0|Don't get this one, get the extended album instead that has all of these songs plus a live concert recording. The live songs are incredible and the commentary by Glen is awesome. One of my favorite albums of all time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fast-paced, challenging, and definitely addicting! It 's so different than anything else out there, but very simple and easy to understand and play.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I got this mixer to do simple home recording. I play guitar and have a condenser mic for singing and acoustic. I work with Sonar 8 Home edition on a Windows 7 Home premium laptop. This unit is great! Out of the box, it's small and simple and is powered by the usb. I love the phantom power which I need for the condenser mic. Make sure to update the drivers to the low-latency audio drivers because the drivers on it were not so low latency. After installing the drivers, recording is great, I can record and monitor through the mixer and it works great. When installing the new drivers, make sure that you remember the usb port that the device was plugged into because the drivers install to that usb port and not to others. There is very little noise during recording and I've had a lot of fun recording. Can't beat the price!
B00009P1OD|1.0|Always did like the very early Chicago albums before they became somewhat commercialized.<br />This one did stand out, it and Transit Authority have been my favorites, so I thought I'd try the remaster of the DVDA.<br />WHAT  A  LETDOWN.....where the DVD is concerned.....can you say BRICKWALLED??<br />My god...it's beyond me how someone who calls themselves an engineer can do something so abominable to a recording as to crank up the gain so all of the original<br />dynamics have been lost.<br />When I ripped this DVD to my hard drive and ran all the tracks thru my editor ..OUCH!!...every one was pumped to EXACTLY the same RMS gain. Nothing was left unadulterated.<br />This a sample of Rhino's junk remastering, pretend to clean up the tracks and then smack them with a *wav hammer* to flatten the sound and then max it out.<br />Needless to say I did not keep the DVD. This isn't the only *remastered* item by Rhino I've come across that basically is junk.<br />If a studio is going to do a remaster..start with the original tapes, digitize them, then clean up the individual tracks, but don't pump up the gain to something that loses the original dynamics of the recordings, try to keep the sound as original as possible.<br /><br />Shame on Rhino.
0545403359|4.0|I admit that I only picked this up to read because of the Spielberg movie but I'm not sorry that I did.  It was surprisingly and refreshingly old-fashioned and a reader just needs that every once in awhile.<br /><br />Joey is a farm horse and has a real connection with his owner, young Albert.  Albert's drunken father sells Joey to keep the family farm.  Joey suddenly goes from being a gently worked farm horse to a true war horse, being used to pull carts and artillery during heavy fighting.  His horror and surprise are evident in every sentence during the entire book and it doesn't take horse sense to see the absolute brutality man can inflict on both beast and human.  Joey's only friend is another horse, Tophorn, and he never gives up hope he might see Albert again one day.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Joey and the sentences are written very short and terse.  Much of the book skips over entire periods of time but perhaps this is how horses think and talk?  The ending is a bit predictable but is still very sweet and a tear-jerker.  (Okay, I weeped at the end, I'll admit it.)<br /><br />This is apparently the first in a series.  It also makes a great companion piece to Black Beauty.  I am intrigued by the idea of a classroom lesson: have the boys read War Horse and the girls read Black Beauty to discuss the stories from a gender point of view.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was using the 'My Bible' app, but it crashed one day and put me back to day one on the reading plan. This app has more reading plans and is working great. The other app also offers podcasts of several preachers so I still use it to listen to podcasts but now use this app for my daily devotions.
0345803507|3.0|I cannot lie. I bought the whole series because I fell in love with Christian and Anastasia. However the writing is terrible. Repetitive words and phrases. Something that really bothered me through out the whole series was how the author referred to Ana's vagina as her \\" sex\\". I mean, she called a penis it's rightful name along with others. Seemed very immature to me. I liked the general ending. But I wish the book would have focused more on their wedding and birth of their son. They spent a few pages on each. Very disappointing. And I didn't care for the mini chapters after the book was over from the point of view of both Christian as a child and adult meeting Ana for the first time. Series could have been so much better had the author had some help and a publisher / editor who cared.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Flash Gordon.<br /><br />That's right, I said it.  For all the modern fascination with special effects, BLUE aliens, metal suits, flying fortresses and capes, my memories drift back to a childhood high cheese favorite named Flash Gordon.  See, in Flash Gordon, this human guy got mixed up in some bad alien juju at the hands of a bald bad guy.  Flying, fighting and high hokum of the Saturday night matinee ensue.  This is precisely what John Carter is.  In fact, John Carter has easily out Flash Gordon'd every single Star Wars prequel because George Lucas's pointless toy commercial epics never had the entertainment or fun factor Andrew Stanton's epic has here.<br /><br />What is wrong with people?<br /><br />How John Carter has been hated on is beyond me.  Wait, I get it, Avatar's aliens are blue not green!  Wait, the Avengers has a bigger flying fortress! Captain America, oh that's right, has a BLUE suit! We was robbed, because John Carter is a total sendup of the old style Disney nonsense adventures like Mary Poppins, Way Down Cellar and the original Escape to Witch Mountain.<br /><br />So let's get this straight, people will pay to see Loki stand around in those ridiculous plastic gold horns for two hours but not this?  What about the dog?  John Carter has that hilarious butt kicking dog!<br /><br />At least see it for the dog.  Did I mention the dog?
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this app about a couple of days ago, and I'm already addicted to it. FIVE STARS!! (I would give it 6 if I could). The only issue is that there is the occasional... lag.

B007R6X9IK|5.0|I am pretty sure there are two camps of people who purchased this album, folks who are fans of Dave Gahan/Depeche Mode and fans of Soulsavers.  I must confess I fall into the former group.  This is not to proclaim any malice towards Soulsavers; I wasn't familiar with them before this release.  Despite that they opened many shows for Depeche during their Tour of the Universe.  I actually saw DM twice on that tour and Soulsavers didn't open on either show that I saw.  Nevertheless, Soulsavers opening for DM is what spawned the collaboration from Gahan and Soulsavers.<br /><br />To put it simply, this album is amazing.  The music is performed by Soulsavers and the vocals and lyrics are done by Gahan.  The combination is pure bliss and really a cathartic journey.  As for the genre this music falls under is a little difficult to describe.  I can say that this sounds nothing like Depeche Mode, no dance beats here. I would say maybe alternative, post-rock or even neo-gospel.  If I had to make a comparison, some of the songs wouldn't be out of place on \\"Paper Monsters\\".  There is a great deal of strings on this album and Dave Gahan lends his harmonica skills on two tracks. The cacophonies are very mellow, haunting, hopeful, aloof, beautiful and introspective.<br /><br />I found Gahan's lyrics to be simple but powerful.  Songs like \\"Take\\" for instance doesn't have a verbose epic quality but is still able to promote an eerie beauty that is very philosophical in a spiritual manner. As for Gahan's voice, well it is still astounding.  His baritone presences are stronger than ever.  I always feel a sense of ease when I hear this man sing.  He is truly an underrated singer.  I was able to listen to this entire album several times while on vacation via headphones as I did a great deal of walking.  I must say taking in this music in a solitary fashion was remarkable.<br /><br />I am extremely interested to look up some of Soulsavers' earlier albums, because these guys have talent.  I have heard that Gahan and Soulsavers would be open to working together again in the future.  I would welcome it.  The only complaint I have about this release is the packaging.  I decided to buy the physical CD mainly because I wanted a copy of the lyrics and some photos.  Sadly this release provides neither and I found that a little disappointing.  I love the album cover and the title \\"The Light the Dead See\\" is such a perfect name for this record.  Nevertheless, this is a great collection of tunes to play on a cold night...with or without a loved one.I have heard that Gahan and Soulsavers would be open to working together again in the future.

B0002BO05S|4.0|Great movie, could have been a bit longer for my taste, but great none the less.  It is the greatest story, as we now have our Savior to help us.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie managed not only to be far more compelling than the (below- )average lot of most superhero movies, as well as far more funny. It was great that each of the heroes was allowed to shine, in the case of Thor and Captain America even more than in their eponymous films. It was excellent to have an action movie plot that didn't try to pad itself out by adding mystery (though there is some of that). The dialog between characters was perfectly written to illustrate their respective personalities, and how they butt heads with one another before learning to work together. My one real complaint is that the Hulk, while a ton of comic smashing fun once he does get rolling, is stretched out a bit too long with Banner lamenting his fate and warning to \\"not get me angry.\\" Still, that's more than made up for once he comes into his own. The sequel hook at the end was also tantalizing, but is probably lost on most casual viewers. Highly recommended!

B007704HO6|4.0|I bought the book for my wife and she loved it. Well worth the money. I don't understand why we have to purchase in dollars. Why can't Amazon allow purchases from their UK sites? It's really irritating to go through the purchase procedure to be told you cannot buy from UK and must go to the USA site.<br />Well Amazon, you insist I write a minimum of 20 words. I was happy with the very first sentence above.
1400069289|3.0|The first half of the book pertains to how personal habits are formed and maintained, or not maintained. It then progresses into a business example using Alcoa. All good to this point. The remainder of the book gets bogged down into lengthy decriptions of business and social examples that could have been addressed in a fraction of the pages.
0345803485|3.0|Alrighty...here goes.<br /><br />I, like many of you, was recommended this book by many women who couldn't put it down.  And I'll admit, I couldn't either.  However, and that's a big \\"however\\", many things in the book really irked me.  While it was a page turner, because I was interested in finding out what happened to the female lead, I just couldn't quite get past several issues.  The first being that I felt like I was reading some teenage girl's fantasy.  (Come to find out, not too far off, as this whole series started off as Twilight fan-fiction, apparently.)  Second, it really bugs me when books, especially those on the New York Times Best Seller's List, have typos.  Seriously?  Who edited these books?  Another thing that I really hate is seeing the same word multiple times in a book, describing the same happenings, over and over again.  How many times can someone murmur in the span of 300 pages?  (I noticed on another review that popped up, the reviewer had used their Kindle to count...yeah, it's that bad.)<br /><br />Not sure that anyone will ever see this review, as there are 5,400 at this point only for the first book.  Yep, even though I was irked half way through the first book, I still read all three.  I'm the kind of person who finishes something once they start it.  All in all, if you want a quick read, go ahead and read them.  They are entertaining, nothing quite like I'd imagined they'd be, but to each their own.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I ordered this for my car, 2006 Mazda 6. It works and did what it was stated to do. Worked great with an SD card, a little bit of noise from a ground loop, probably cutting corners on the product. The ground loop noise got very bad when using it with either my Zune HD or my wife's iPod through the aux in jack. I would recommend this if you're in a tight spot, but there is definitely better products out there. I ended up making my own aux in for the factory deck in my car and no longer use it.
0345803493|3.0|I have no clue if you can even read my review on the first book, but the same pretty much goes for the following two of the series.  While they are all entertaining, they aren't written very well.  They are page turners, though, so for a quick read, they are tolerable.  If you are expecting grandiose story-telling, look elsewhere.  If you don't mind a story that started as Twilight fan-fiction that you can't seem to put down for some odd reason, read this series.

B006P0FICE|2.0|This was a dismal attempt at reinventing the Three Musketeers.  The airships just did not work in the setting.  The climax was certainly anything but that.  And the acting, though the cast included fine actors, was poor.  All in all I was very disappointed and sorry that I wasted my money on the blu-ray!
B0010SKUYM|2.0|I don't know how this book has gotten so many high reviews. Am I so far out of touch with the rest of the fantasy-reading community? To be honest, I haven't really liked much fantasy after GRRM. I used to love Feist, Weis&Hickman, Jordan, even Goodkind in a pulpy way, but I can't enjoy them as much anymore. So maybe I have just lost interest in epic fantasy after 25 years of loving it.<br /><br />I am halfway through the book and I am having to force myself to continue. I find it to be highly self-indulgent. Kvothe tells a story of himself that paints him as basically a god among men, a prodigy who excels at nearly anything he attempts. While he is not flawless, every time he makes a mistake I get the feeling it is only to show us how capable he is at overcoming mistakes. This book is like a really long Chuck Norris joke.<br /><br />Kvothe is perfect and he wants everyone to know it. Actually no, it is Chronicler who wants us all to know it. Kvothe can just barely be bothered to let us lowlife readers hear about his brilliance. Just so long as we don't in any way offend his perfect sensibilities.<br /><br />It is not the worst thing I've ever read by a long shot. I probably will continue reading in the hope that something interesting will happen. I just felt like sharing my experience with prospective buyers who might be taken in by all the over-the-top praise in some of these reviews.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Piscine Molitor Patel (nickname: Pi) grows up as an impressionable young son of a zookeeper in India. When the family decides to sell the zoo animals and relocate to Canada, they board a cargo ship with the caged animals and set off. Tragedy strikes, the ship sinks, and young Pi (now sixteen, I think) finds himself on a 20-foot lifeboat with a wounded zebra, a hyperactive hyena, a likeable orangutan and a waiting tiger as his only companions. Soon, as you can imagine, it's just he and the tiger.<br /><br />Let's back up. Pi's passion is Christ. Well, and Muhammed. And Krishna. As a practicing Christian, Muslim, and Hindu in India, he sees no reason to choose between the three, but this drives his three spiritual advisors batty. Only one of the three can be right, right? The stage is set for a journey which will uncover God, for that is the book's promise: to deliver a story that will make you believe in God.<br /><br />But in the middle of the shark-infested Pacific ocean, with a ferocious Bengal tiger filling most of the lifeboat, God seems to slip out of the story. Where has God gone? Why bother introducing Pi's triune confusion, if only to let God slide by the wayside? Most readers, I'm convinced, will never find Him again. You won't find God either, if you don't keep your eyes open, or if you point those eyes only up to heaven.  Even those who imagine they have uncovered Martel's postmodern message may be unwilling to probe inside the fanciful tale atop the banal story wherein God dwells.<br /><br />Martel, by the way, is a great storyteller.

B00275EGWY|5.0|Except for the first few minutes of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" no film I've ever seen comes closer than \\"The Hurt Locker\\" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.<br /><br />The principal character, Sgt. First Class William James (Jeremy Renner) is one of those who seem to get an adrenaline rush in the face of danger. His colleagues, Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackle) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geaghty), see no glamor in their task. Sanborn is a workman-like soldier, trying to do his duty in as safe a manner as possible. Eldridge is in a near-constant state of panic, eager to be somewhere else, any place else. They are not presented as stereotypes, however, nor is anyone else in this absorbing movie. Everyone in the field knows he may die at any moment, and how they manage to hold up in the searing heat of Iraq in a war they aren't asked to understand may be the main point of this film, if indeed it has any point other than War is Hell and the Iraqi War is a particularly terrible slice of Hell.<br /><br />PS. Everyone that goes to see this movie isn't a war veteran or soldier. We(average joes that make up a majority of the population) don't care about how accurate or not it is. The plot is great. The actors are great. The directing is phenomenal. The whole movie is great.
B0088LU3P0|5.0|that matthew weiner could pull off one of the most satiric thrusts in television, while also depicting a large human tragedy, will certainly have to go down as a great moment in tv. the jaguar has been the joke of a product throughout this season and in this next to concluding episode, he gives it the final one two punch.<br /><br />don meanwhile has bigger fish to fry and wants to sell the country on napalm manufactured by Dow Chemical.  we know all too well how he will succeed at that. as for cars, he wants Chevy, not Jaguar.<br /><br />there is something huge which happens in this episode but it would be a spoiler to mention it.  let's just say that some things were bound to end tragically and they do.  how don draper handles this crisis says volumes more about don draper than it does about the crisis itself.  he still tends to see human beings rather one dimensionally and thinks them capable of countless reinventions.  of course he wouldn't be a great ad man if he couldn't sell people on the hope of reinventing themselves with the products he pitches.  but most cannot do so and he cannot understand this, especially since he took on the identity of a whole new person in the previous decade.<br /><br />sally finally attains puberty and I assume the torrent of hormones about to be unleashed on her parents and the violent late 1960s will take up a considerable part of ensuing Mad Men episodes. this is the lull before the storm with her and I can hardly wait for that storm.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|Exceeding expectations and more than making up for past questionable artistic decisions, here's an excellent return to form from America's band, The Beach Boys. It reminds me of their classic \\"Today\\" album from 1965. Expertly crafted summertime fun anthems cover the majority of the record's first half while the second part is heavy on introspection and melancholy. These guys could have easily produced an album of tired re-writes of their past hits but chose instead to dream up one last truly great pure pop record. If this is to be the band's swansong as expected, they will have gone out with an impressive final statement. Not bad at all for a bunch of dudes in their 70's. Enjoy!
145162445X|2.0|This book is a very mixed blessing. The reportage on stuff the physicists have come up with is damned good, but the actual premise of the book? Totally unfulfilled. He never actually gets to \\"something from nothing\\" other than what is essentially a deus ex machina, and the stuff about quantum gravity hasn't an ounce of empirical evidence to back it up. As to ephemeral states for other universes? That something vanishes before it can be observed is nothing that was demonstrably ever there except as a figment of his imagination.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|\\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is an excellent new album from The Beach Boys.  I love listening to the radio in the car.  The title track reminds me of all the reasons why I love music. Listening to music is a celebration of life.  Music creates memories of happy times that I will remember forever.  Nothing beats listening to a great song on the radio with a girl or someone else.  \\"Think About The Days\\" is ninety seconds of perfect harmonizing by Brian Wilson, Mike Love and the rest of the band.  This track features goregous piano playing too. \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" is a sweet love song.  This song has a visual aspect with the ocean as a symbol of romance.  \\"Beaches In Mind\\" is another fun song.  The beach has always been a place to spend time with friends and relax. \\"From There And Back Again\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\" have a soothing reflective tone.  These two song make me think of all the good times I had with my high school buddies.  These songs make me sad, but they are still beautiful songs with great lyrics.  Isn't It Time is a song about trying to rekindle a relationship with a special woman.  This song is a reminder that no relationship is ever dead.  This song fills me with a sense of hope. \\"The Private Life Of Bill and Sue\\" is about the public's obsession with the lives of celebrities.

B007N85ZXY|2.0|...the typical roaring guitars are great, but most of the arrangements are unimaginative.  All the same speed, loudness, alternation of verses and occasional solos.  The backing vocals are mostly just irritating. Can't someone tell Crazy Horse not to sing?<br />1) Oh, Susannah: would be OK if it were not for the nearly constant background chant of \\"Oh, Susannah,\\" and the corny \\"b-a-n-j-o\\" on his knee.<br />2) Clementine: OK except for the background \\"oh, my darling\\".<br />3) Tom Dula: OK except for the background chant of \\"Tom Dooley\\".<br />4) Gallows Pole: This can't hold a light to Led Zepplin's version.<br />5) Get a Job: I can see why he wanted to do this song, but it doesn't suit him.  What he brings to the song doesn't work.<br />6) Travel On: The first song I didn't dislike.  Dylan used this as the closing song on the Rolling Thunder II tour (Spring, 1976) as a sort of throw-away group-sing.  Neil's version compares well to that.<br />7) High Flyin' Bird: Pretty good--nothing to dislike.  And the sentiment suits him.<br />8) Jesus' Chariot (Comin' Round the Mountain): OK, except for the background chant \\"When she comes\\".  The commentary in the booklet is interesting, and makes the arrangement seem plausible.<br />9) This Land is Your Land...: Nice.  Choir backing is well-done.<br />10) Wayfarin' Stranger: First arrangement that is different from the roaring guitars, verse-solo pattern.<br />11) God Save the Queen: Nice touch that this is released during the Queen's 60th Jubilee.  Back to the corny backing vocals.  Interesting combination and arrangement of lyrics.<br />Except for 9, 10, and 11, I don't get the sense that Neil likes these songs, or that they say anything to him, or that he has anything to say through them.  He's just playing them--and playing them all the same.  I guess he couldn't think of any songs of his own this time.  A disc of these traditional songs sounds like it'll be just corny or boring--and it is.<br />I advance-ordered this from the NY site, and got it with a t-shirt and an 8 x 11\\" version of the insert.

1603427244|5.0|Cast On Bind Off includes 54 step-by-step methods for casting on and binding off.  It begins with cast ons and ends with bind offs.  The information is wonderful for every knitter's library.  As most knitters, I tend to use a single type of cast on and bind off and tend to stick with these techniques.  As the author states, this is usual.  The author discusses how she realized that different projects call for different types of cast ons and bind offs and that \\"different situations call for different techniques, and that using the right one has a huge impact on the finished garment.\\"  Most of us learned a particular type of cast on or bind off from the person who taught us how to knit and we tend to stick with that.  \\"My hope is that this book opens a new world of possibilities and expands your horizons for beginning and ending a knitted project.\\"  This book can be used to learn new techniques, offers ways to experiment with different techniques and opens us up to a whole world of casting on and binding off that we didn't even know existed.<br /><br />\\"In this book you'll find 33 different cast ons and 21 different bind offs.  Each technique features photographs illustrating every step\\".  The book is small enough to take with you when working on a project and includes tips on what technique is best for certain types of projects.<br /><br />The cast ons are divided into basic ones, stretchy, decorative, circular, double-sided, multicolor, provisional, tubular and mobius.  The bind offs include basic, stretchy, decorative, and sewn.  The photographs, drawings and diagrams are excellent and show in detail how to do each type of cast on and bind off.<br /><br />As a relatively experienced knitter I thought I knew quite a bit about casting on and binding off.  This book opened me up to a whole new world of binding off and casting of.  It's a wonderful reference book and one I don't know how I did without until now.  I highly recommend it and plan to try many of these techniques right away.  It is an essential addition to my knitting library.niques right away.  It is an essential addition to my knitting library.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I like erotica/trashy novels just as much as the next stay at home mom or housewife, but these books are terrible. Beyond terrible. They are so poorly written, it's hard to get past the constant \\"inner goddess\\" or lip chewing. Does the author not employ an editor? And if so, she should probably fire him or her and look else where. I find it fitting that most of the people I know that like the book(s) are under the age of 25 - as this book is written for 21 year old girls who THINK they know something about S&M and know nothing. Read Molly Weatherfield's Carrie's Story or Anne Rice's (pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure) Sleeping Beauty Trilogy if you really want to read some fun stuff.

B002LFPAUC|4.0|In 1971, John Cleese and the rest of the team from [[ASIN:B000GEIRSM Monty Python's Flying Circus]] encountered rude treatment at a hotel.  This experience led to the development of \\"Fawlty Towers,\\" a sitcom that originally appeared on the BBC in 1975 and 1979.  In the series, Cleese plays Basil Fawlty, manager of the Fawlty Towers hotel in Torquay on the Devon coast.<br /><br />Fawlty (mis)manages the hotel with his wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), and with hired help Polly (Connie Booth) and Manuel (Andrew Sachs).  The four trifle with both the guests and each other, and the show is witty with fast-paced dialogue and comedy of errors-style humor.  Some of the situations the crew stumbles into involve botched hotel repairs, restaurant meals gone wrong, and an untimely death.<br /><br />The first two discs in this set contain the twelve episodes of the series, and there is a third bonus disc recalling this classic series that containing interviews, outtakes, and other material.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I had to check the date when I spun this.  They really sound just the same (and as good) as ever.  Brian Wilson sings with a slight slur these days due to years of drug abuse, but really, if I could sing like these guys in my late 60's I would be pretty happy!  I cannot really see how anyone who has ever liked the Beach Boys would not be delighted with this album, at this late stage.  This is not some sad toss-off- it is a serious attempt at recapturing that soaring magic of Pet Sounds and Summer Days/Summer Nights, that endless summer wave, and their giddy 60's/70's heyday. The production is first class, the melodies are strong and the harmonies sparkle, even if one of the guitar players is helping with the really high parts that Carl would have done.  Brian and Mike are all over this, too (in fact, Mike's sole written 'Daybreak Over the Ocean' is one of the best songs on it.  Mike has gotten a hard time in recent years, IMO.  I'm sure he was a pain in the you-know-what at times, but the guy is not the freakin devil, give him a break- he wrote lots of the lyrics and was alot of the fun in the band- a good counterbalance to Brians self-absorbed genius). To top it all off, it closes with one of Brians beautiful epic mulit-part suites, that really says goodbye perfectly.<br />Great summer music- don't miss the Beach Boys last!<br />Highlights- Title song, Daybreak Over the Ocean, and the closing three song suite.
1594744769|5.0|A unique book.  I thought it was beautifully written and the story flowed very well.  It stretched the realms of reality without being too far fetched.  Everything \\"Peculiar\\" in it felt like it could actually be true in this world.  Ok some of it had been done before but what made the book unique were the photographs.<br /><br />At first I thought they were photographs that had been created for the book as they fitted in so well with the story.  Then, at the end, the author explained that they were actually real old photos.  This just blew my mind away as it made the book so very clever as the story and photos were so perfectly aligned.<br /><br />I would love to know if he had written the story and then hunted for the photos to go along with it or if he already had the photos and changed the story to make use of certain images!<br /><br />Even after finishing the book I sat for a while looking back at the photos and just appreciating the art of this book.  Knowing the photos were posed by real people made me wonder what on earth they were doing posing in such strange sets, costumes and poses.  It would be interesting if anyone knew of the real people in the photos - grandmothers etc - and what the real story behind them was.<br /><br />A book I would recommend to anyone who likes a good story but also appreciates something a bit different in their reading.

B005FNVDSA|4.0|Of course, there are many other better versions of the Brahms First Piano Concerto in the recording market. Even Maurizio Pollini himself, a decade ago, signed one which in my opinion has remained a landmark for the work's interpretation. That time, he was paired by a fabulous orchestra (Berlin Philharmonic) and a legendary conductor (Claudio Abbado). Although inevitable, comparisons are not the point of this commentary.<br /><br />Now, Pollini (almost 70) comes back to the beloved score and decides to re-record it this time in the company of the Dresden Staatskapelle (under Christian Thielemann, its new chief-conductor). Nothing wrong in his option, except the fact that - in technical terms - this new live CD takes the risk to be compared to Pollini's quite perfect version of late 1990s. When opposed to Dresdners, Berliners are definitely more supportive, more flexible and more prompt in giving the soloist the mellow atmosphere Brahms work requires. Not to speak about the recorded sound supplied by (the same!) DG! Now is not at the same qualitative level as the previous attempt used us. On the other hand, the sentimental significance of Pollini's gesture of coming back to a beloved stage, to a legendary orchestra and to a sensitive audience places by itself the outcome to a high valuable level.<br /><br />All in all, I think this new release is to be regarded merely as a memento marking the debut of a promising collaboration (Dresden - Thielemann) granted by a super star of the musical world (Maurizio Pollini). Pollini's performance = 5 stars, recording's technical conditions = 3 stars.

B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Joe Walsh  \\"Analog Man\\"  (2012).<br /><br />When I heard that Jeff Lynne was going to produce Joe Walsh's new album, i was excited, i knew this was going to be a real charmer, but instead after listening to it twice already, i'm just a little bummed.  Everything sounds good, but it sounds so cookie cutter.  Walsh doesn't really get it going till \\"India\\", a good rocker.  Other good tracks i like are, the George Harrison sound of \\"Band Played On\\" and \\"Fishbone\\".  Just a real bummer after a year of build-up.  I love Jeff Lynne projects, but the last two have been let downs. Update:  After several more listens, i've grown to really like this new offering by Joe Walsh, \\"One Day At A Time\\" and \\"Hi-Roller Baby\\", are great tunes.

B007N85ZXY|5.0|Someone sent me a link that included this whole album and I had no idea what this was all about.  But I am a long-time Neil fan, so I gladly indulged in listening to this.  At first--not knowing what was going on--I thought that the first song was weird--  kind of a usual Neil Young and Crazy Horse romp on the old folkie \\"Oh, Susannah\\" via a melody that reminded me of Shocking Pink's \\"Venus\\".  I started thinking, this album is gonna kind suck a little bit like Neil's own Shocking Pinks foray back in the 1980s.  I was ready to declare this album Neil's worst based on the first song.<br /><br />Then they start into \\"My Darling Clementine\\" and I'm thinking, wait a minute something's going on here and I go to the internet to read about Neil's new album.  That's when I see that this is a collection of American songs--a musical history lesson.<br /><br />I started listening more closely and appreciating the album for what it is.  This is a classic Neil and Crazy Horse sound with fun and clever, but ragged rollicking rock and roll with some folksy edge to it.  The songs are all done well and I think this one will grow on me with further listenings.<br /><br />One of my favorites in this collection is that old 60s standard \\"High Flying Bird\\".  Neil and the boys put an appropriately psychedelic bent to the song and it made me feel like I was back in the Fillmore West or someplace like that.<br /><br />There's do-wop, folk, gospel, and \\"My Country Tis of Thee\\" all rolled into one party-round-the-campfire package and rock and roll your socks off.  It's good stuff that in my initial listening went from Neil's worst to as good as it gets for a lesson in musicology.  I might have gone with 4 stars, but the totally unwarranted one star reviews made me kick it up like it did another reviewer on this site.  Besides after a few more listenings this would probably get 5 stars from me anyway.<br /><br />Another surprise from Neil Young who proves here that his gig's not up yet.  What will he do next!!!ill he do next!!!
0385534639|3.0|From the very start of the book you can tell it's going to be a somewhat dark read.  It starts off with a six year old girl that has been delivered to her father with her mother's suicide letter pinned to her coat.  Open noticing her, her father states an expletive and then tells her that he thinks she'll be useful while squeezing her face.  Sounds pleasant, huh?<br /><br />But the book isn't horrible, that's the thing.  The author is pretty talented; Ms. Morgenstern paints you a picture of a different kind of circus then we are used to.  This circus appears at random in different locations and is only open at night.  Each tent holds something different to experience.  There are tricks done without safety nets and illusions that are incredible but can't possibly be real, can they?<br /><br />This book was extremely well written and I can honestly say that I've never read anything remotely like it; it is, in truth, one of a kind.  Why did I only give it 3 ½ stars then?  The writing was great, the story unique, I just felt like it didn't have the extra something to give it the other 1 ½ stars.  Also, I lost a little interest towards the middle; I wasn't really rushing to pick it back up.<br /><br />It's hard to say much more because I don't want to give anything away to anyone who wants to read the book.  But I'll leave you with my favorite quote.<br /><br />\\"It is important,\\" the man in the grey suit interrupts.  \\"Someone needs to tell those tales.  When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative.  There's magic in that.  It's in the listener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict.  From the mundane to the profound.  You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose.  That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words.  That is your role, your gift.  Your sister may be able to see the future, but you yourself can shape it, boy.  Do not forget that.\\"  He takes another sip of his wine.  \\"There are many kinds of magic, after all.\\"<br />~page 381<br /><br />My Rating:  3 ½ out of 5 stars<br /><br />Happy reading!<br /><br />~Pamale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Before Beautiful Disaster I had honestly never read an indie author's book before.  I always stuck with best sellers and never even really had a true love for reading.  I read Beautiful Disaster and was SO hooked from page 1 that I couldn't stop.  I'd never just read a book within a couple of days before, but this book was different.  I just couldn't get enough of this story, and the characters and the emotions it brought out in me.  Beautiful Disaster helped me to find my love of reading, and I am so grateful to Jamie for that.  BUY THIS BOOK!  You definitely won't be disappointed!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I love this show. When my cousin's husband first brought it up, I was like, \\"Eh..maybe...\\". One night, he turned it on while we were all getting ready to watch a different movie. My cousin and I stayed up til 3AM watching it before she finally had to quit since she had to work in three hours. It's gory and there is a TON of sex...but really the show is just unbelievable. I, like i stated before, love it. It's one of those shows were you are on the edge of your seat and completely disappointing when the episode is over because you want it to keep going. Buying this show is definitively something I would recommend. I am super excited for season 2 to come out on DVD and for season 3 to begin!

0345803485|5.0|This book and the trilogy are wellllll beyond worth it!! It's not Twilight fairy-vampire-werewolf!! I know it says it was \\"based\\" on it, but trust me, it really isn't! It's not a literary piece of art, nor a \\"classic,\\" but it wasn't written to become one. It was for entertainment---nailed that on the head!! That said, I bought all three and read them all in 6 days. I couldn't put them down! Besides all the sexy, erotic sex scenes, it's a sad, messed up, crazy love story. You keep turning to see what happens next! I loved how James not only wrote it from Ana's interpretation of the events, but from her conscious and \\"inner goddess.\\" I really loved it! Third book turned out sweeter than I expected. Oh, and forewarning, you actually start to miss the books once you finish. Round two! Ahah.<br /><br />Bottom line: James makes you wish the characters, especially Christian, actually existed and makes you care about them. It's great! READ IT! :) You won't be upset you did!

B0058VA2U4|5.0|This is one of Anthrax's best CD's, and that's saying a lot considering they have a lot great discs. This disc has a ton of great hooks and great riffs, its just all around great. This disc is a perfect example as to why Anthrax deserves to be one of the Big Four.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Okay, so I had some reservations about this CD. They made some story changes from the Broadway Musical (which I LOVED!) and I was wary about hearing some of the cast members sing. Well, I cannot say anything about the story changes since I have not seen the movie yet, but this Soundtrack as its own separate entity ROCKS! The cast sings wonderfully... even Tom Cruise. His rendition of \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" (a song not in the original show... for some reason the authors of the play were not able to get the rights to any of Def Leopard's songs, but they were able to get them for the movie) blew me away. His vocals are pretty damn good. The arrangements of the songs are kind of a mix up of the original and the musical versions. There is really no vocal misstep on this soundtrack. Even Russell Brand (whom I cannot stand) holds his own. This is one of those rare instances where I really don't have any complaints about a CD. It is of course not 100% flawless, but any gripes are so minor they don't have any bearing really on the CD as a whole. (Main gripe is the song Paradise City, but only because I cannot stand that song). For anyone who loved the show or even loves the Hair Metal of the 80's, this CD is a perfect addition to your music collection. And of course, GO SEE THE MOVIE when it comes out June 15!<br />Best Tracks:<br />Hit Me With Your Best Shot- Catherine Zeta-Jones gives Pat Benatar a run for her money as a rocker chick.<br />Here I Go Again- This song was a great choice as the Act One Finale of the musical. This version is so great.<br />Any Way You Want It- Ms. Blige is awesome as Justice.<br />Don't Stop Believin'- This is NOT the Glee arrangement, it is the musical arrangement which came out before the Glee version. Great Finale to the show. Can't wait to see how it is staged in the movie.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I absolutely love this disc ! Im a MegaDeth fan from way back, and I can see the absoultely fantastic music they have created and the not so great music. On this Disc there are no clunkers. Song after song of great metal. I will not classify this as thrash, because it isnt but what it is great heavy metal. its totally loaded with hooks, melodys and great riffs. I love the way Chris Broderick plays guitar. I think hes a great addition to the band. Dave Mustaine and Chris Broderick are a great combination. This disc is proof positive.

It appears to be an Anglo-Indian production.<br /><br />Seven British retirees, for various reasons that mainly boil down to finances and how much cheaper it is to live in India than the United Kingdom, decide to outsource their golden days. They trundle off to Jaipur to take up residence in what the internet has led them to believe is a newly restored luxury hotel.  However, they find the place has been Photoshopped, and is not yet ready for prime time.  But India and the hotel soon begin to exercise their charm on the seniors.<br /><br />The film stars Dame Judi Dench ([[ASIN:B004XYOQU4 Her Majesty, Mrs Brown]]), as Evelyn Greenslade, widowed housewife; Tom Wilkinson, who played Mr. Dashwood in the 1995 version of  [[ASIN:B000053W5D Sense and Sensibility (1995)]],  plays Graham Dashwood, retired judge. Bill Nighy ([[ASIN:B001JIFYSA Love Actually]]) is Douglas Ainslie, henpecked former civil servant; Penelope Wilton,([[ASIN:B005Q1W0ZQ Downton Abbey: Season 2 ]]) is Jean Ainslie, Douglas's fearsome wife; Dame Maggie Smith, (DOWNTON ABBEY), is Muriel Donnelly, unhappy and angry former housekeeper to a wealthy family, and a racist--but a funny one--to boot.  Dev Patel ([[ASIN:B001P9KR8U Slumdog Millionaire]]) plays Sonny Kapoor, manager of the hotel; the lovely and charming Tena Desae, who, however, is not the lovely and charming Freida Pinto from SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, plays his girlfriend Sunaina.  Then there's Ronald Pickup as Norman Cousins, who hopes there's some life in the old boy yet, and Celia Imre as Madge Hardcastle, widowed housewife, who definitely thinks there's some life in the old girl yet, and hopes it's enough to land one last husband, hopefully a wealthy one.  According to IMDb, Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole were first cast as the latter two characters.  Imre and Pickup do fine jobs, but Christie and O'Toole are long time favorites of mine, and I can only imagine what the film might have been like with those two formerly-cast actors in the parts.  Oh well...<br /><br />Aside from a few opening scenes presumably set in the U.K., most of the film seems to have been made on location in India, and it does a good job of giving us that country's flora, fauna, and social ways, its bustle and optimism.  However, it barely touches on the problems of that immense country; guess you can't expect a feel-good comedy to do that. Never mind, while Jean Ainslie reads [[ASIN:0385334923 Tulip Fever]], another novel by author Moggach now in development to film, her husband Douglas, and most of the other characters - and the viewers with them-- begin to explore the dynamic city in which they find themselves. It's surely worth a look any day.one last husband, hopefully a wealthy one.  According to IMDb, Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole were first cast as the latter two characters.

067144901X|4.0|Really, you can't go wrong with any Sandra Boynton book; they are the best. I am leaving this review for people who are trying to choose, since we now have accumulated quite a few of her books. This book starts out great, reading with Boynton's signature sing-songy rhythm, but abruptly falls flat at the end. Our favorite Boynton books are the ones that facilitate the most interaction: Snuggle Puppy, Horns to Toes, and Belly Button Book. Happy Hippo, Angry Duck is a great book to read when your baby is cranky. Our bedtime favorites are Pajama Time and The Going to Bed Book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" was the best book I have read all year.  The content was on a difficult subject that the author made into a lovely story of truth, love and understanding.  When I cannot put a book down, that means I have chosen a winner. I didn't want it to end. Kudos to Vanessa Diffenbaugh.
B0086700CM|5.0|my lest favorite thing is you can not post to facebook to show your friends what you have done but after that tu. to enjoy
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I am LOVING this CD \\"That's Why God Made The Radio.\\"  I knew when I heard the title track it would be a good one, but when I heard the rest of the songs I was truly feeling like I'd weep tears of joy! In a sense, the album feels a bit like SMiLE Part II. Brian Wilson described the first smile as a \\"teenaged boys prayer to God\\"...well some of the songs on this CD reminds me of what that teenaged boy might pray now that he's an older, experienced, wiser and no-worse-for-the-wear man.  The first track \\"Think About the Days\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Our Prayer.\\"  Oh, those harmomies...same as when we first fell in love with the band way back in the 60s! I like the somewhat self-mocking lyrics in \\"Spring Vacation.\\"  The song \\"Isn't It Time\\" seems to be a rallying cry of sorts, encouraging us to put aside our 'grown up worries' get out there and recapture the joy of summers past and live it for today. The song \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" cracked me up. Quite the statement about reality shows and relentless couch potatoes lol.  I like the whimsical feel of \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" nice take on that classic children's song My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean. You definitely get a sense of wistfulness in the song \\"From There To Back Again\\" but again it's encouragement to not live in the past but take the best of the past and live for today. Overall, the album is a very pleasant listen. So I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the Beach Boys.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ever seriously buy it I am serious only someone extremely stupid would not buy this app
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle and be free forever!!!! it is a very good game and you can even change the sentive level to your liking. :)
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it tends to glitches just a little with the kindle still for free it's great.Such a fun way to waste the time away
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty decent.  some games are herder than others but none are impossible.  provides a way to mindlessly pass the time because it involves little time commitment.  glad I have it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these mini games are a good collection of games and I love that they are free! very entertaining collection of games
B000Y0OBH4|5.0|One of the truely best episodes of this show. Even as a girl I have been in a bullying situation like Leonard experiences in this episode and the method he uses to put the big mean idiot in his place makes me happy every time I see it. Also Raj as Thor is friggin brilliant!
B00881VLCE|1.0|it always has puzzle pieces that you cant pick up!!!!! But besides that, the pictures were very cute and if they fixed the glitches, it would be a fun game
B00170K9YY|5.0|I love this episode because it introduces Soft Kitty to the world. I'm a big whiney baby when I am sick and now I make my husband sing me Soft Kitty because it actually is the perfect sick song. Watching how the world runs in fear from Sheldon while he is sick is absolutely hysterical and should be experienced by everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! I read the negative before I got it, and in my opinion, the positive outweighs the negative.<br />I have searched high and low for a *good* Catholic Bible. I am so grateful for this. You have so many choices of what version of the Bible you want to read.<br />Thank you so very much.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run it is the best game ever if I had to pick only one game to have it would be temple run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|i really like this game. the levels get harder ad you progress. and sometimes get frustrating.  but the game allows you to skip around and go back.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was great!!, it had some humor in it which made it good, the hulk and the other characters just show how to work together!

B007NESBK2|5.0|I have a large collection of concert dvds and blu-ray discs,  Most of which I treasure. This concert ( which I saw in Adelaide South Australia[[ASIN:B007NESBK2 Sade: Bring Me Home - Live 2011 (Blu-ray)]] is a stand out in my collection. Sade's songs together with her outstanding musicians, innovative arrangements, stunning stage presentation and lighting are simply superb. Put it all on Bluray, watch and listen and just salivate over the whole show. This is my first Amazon review after some years of purchasing music. So do yourself a favor and get it. cheers Robert Anderspon.
1466401885|3.0|A bit of a let down after FSOG!  Like it but did not love it!  I don't think anything could compare to FSOG!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a really good book that I will read again. Thanks to all the men and women who serve for our country.
B0086700CM|5.0|Seriously a great game, and it costs nothing. What are you waiting for? One of the best &quot;runner&quot; style games Knave played.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this everyday! It is a great app.  Fun and easy to play; a nice way to relax and unwind.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This quick and simple card game is addicting. I am able to learn the upper levels with the help of the suggestion button. It's a perfect way to kill five minutes. However, there are pop ups nearly every time I begin a game... for another app game mostly, but also for cars and breast cancer awareness. They don't interfere with the game and don't create any trouble on my reader. My only problem with them is that on some of them I can't get my tool bar up quick enough to get rid of them. (It's the hidden cost of free :] )
0060775858|5.0|This book, by the late Margaret Wise Brown, lets us explore the rabbit in it's natural habitat. Which apparently is a 19th Century nursery. Pajam'ed and incredibly aware of his surroundings, our hero is a tiny bunny preparing for a night in, taking meticulous inventory of all his surroundings. My own sons, both of a limited verbal proficiency are able to enjoy the short text on each page, and the intermittent usage of color and then b&w illustration mixes things up. This is the first book in a series of surreal books by the author and her illustrator, and the recurrence of the paintings in the latter work feels like some sort of proto-hipster self referencing. But then again, Marge was probably one of the more rock 'n roll childrens book authors of all time, so why should we be surprised?
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I bought this soundtrack because I LOVED the movie, the music being half of the reason for that. All the songs are remixes of older songs, and they're done so well. The style is mainly electro-fantasy, with a little bit of everything else to accompany it. I love every song on the CD (even the \\"I Want It All/We Will Rock You mash-up\\" that most people don't like; it seems out of place at first, but it's grown on me). I love that all the songs are long, usually around 5 and 6 minutes long, so even though there are only 9 tracks on the CD, you'll be listening to it forever (not to mention as good as the songs are, you'll want to keep this CD on repeat for days! I know I did!)<br /><br />I love all the artists they had working on these songs, they really made it a stand-out hit. Emily Browning has an AMAZING voice, and even Bjork who I thought would be strange on this CD made a fantastic remix of a great song.<br /><br />Couldn't love this CD more. I only wish more movies did soundtracks in this style.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I'm starting to remember on how to be sarcastic again. Too bad the music industry is too stupid to get along with. I was looking forward to hearing the music Daria played through the series. But according to the creator, that is why the DVD took so long to come out. Oh, well. Daria still rocks.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been using this app for several months now and am impressed with the seamless google calendar and google task integration. No lost tasks or calendar items so far.<br />The Agenda view is especially well-designed, especially with a complex list of tasks and appointments for the day. In all, a very solid calendar product that is perfect for those tied to Google apps.
B000256TD0|5.0|What can I say about a Delorean?<br /> My son thought \\"I was the best mom in the World\\"<br />Although he's married it sits in a place of honor, in their livingroom.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Snow White and the Huntsmen is a truly dark and action packed version of the classic fairy tale. It's like they tried to take a simple story and turn it into an epic Lord of the Rings version. It didn't quite reach that level, but the visuals, action scenes, music and acting were great. Charlize Theron made for a beautiful and very, very evil queen. Thor himself did a fine job as the huntsman and even Kristen Stewart was good enough for me to forget about that Twilight garbage. Even the dwarves, played by non-dwarf actors like Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone had shining moments. Not much else to say other than it was worth seeing in theaters and I know I'll be watching it again on Blu-ray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This has proven to be a great tool! Highly recommend this app! Easy to use and something I use daily.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|very enjoyable version of freecell, especially after using the free versions with all their ads.  this is a major improvement!
B00079FUI6|5.0|I love this series, it is funny, sad, and crazy fits right in with my personality.  I am sad that it is no longer on TV but I will have all the seasons soona nd will be able to watch when I want.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app has saved me at dr appts, on trips, and just around the house on a rainy day or just wanting to doodle. My 3yr old loved using this app to show us how he writes his name & ABC's. He enjoys coloring shapes & playing with the sticker pages. He really thinks it's cool after he found out the stickers could grow & shrink! Great app to entertain the family & even play games!
B004X60QE2|5.0|One of the funniest SCI FI programs out there.  Nothing scary just plain old fashion fun.  Another program ending and I will watch when I have the time.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The current local & map does not refresh & stay current. Ex: Look at it at 4pm then look at it again at 7pm, it will not update the information. Need to work on this app because I normally enjoy & rely on TWC.
B007SGM084|3.0|Starts off well enough but gets boring and repetitive by the third book.  Christian is supposed to be a sexual deviant \\"Dom/Alpha\\" and Ana his young curious/virginal \\"SUB in-training.\\"  Could have been great, sorry, but No! - didnt turn out that way.  I've read tons of books with a LOT more erotic/kinky scenes and way more explicitly described sexscapades (books that are quite delish and satisfying) and THIS series does NOT qualify.  I was talking out loud to the book like - \\"come on do SOMETHING different already.\\"  Never happened!  All the hoopla and I was let down.  The author really could have put everything in ONE book and been done (AND had a better overall well rounded and satifying finish). IMO [Afterthought: I did like the BEN WHA BALLS/PARTY scene though - but a few \\"good\\" scenes here and there, does not make a book great - I mean WHAT are these women reading if THIS is considered HOT and EROTIC ... really?! NOT! There are waaay better books then this out there if they really want EROTIC and/or HOT!] Read: Training to Pleasure by Juilian Masters ... [its more DOM/sub then romance and NOT for the faint of heart] but if you're looking to get your kink on, this one will definitely fit the bill.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I thought this would be more fun & challenging but I easily conquered the levels faster than the original game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run I hag been waiting for this game for so long it is so mucklh fun buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it buy it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The government of Panem was furious about being shown up in the 74th annual Hunger Games. Well, now it's time to find out what kind of crackdown was in store. This book is an emotional ride and arguably the most dynamic in the entire series. Incredible character building, the diligent creation and interconnection of some fascinating subplots and much more. All of this centers around the themes of love, loyalty and friendship in a world that seems more than hostile to those very ideas. Must Read!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I certainly will recommend to all my friends.  I rely on reviews and have never been disappointed.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|This is a great app! For all you information junkies out there: this app is your best bet. But there are a few problems...<br />-It doesn't save your searches.<br />-You can only have one page open at once.<br /><br />But if you look past its impurities, it is truly a great app. Perfect if you're doing something such as a report for school, or just looking up random info (I'm talking to you, logos quiz players.)
B007JRU2UK|4.0|George Clooney running in boat shoes makes me chuckle just thinking about it.  Very good movie, plays with all your emotions.
1610454812|5.0|Very moving. Very inspirational. Tissues are a must! An incrediable read about a true american hero. Who shows the true meaning of being a patriot.
B0086700CM|4.0|ive been waiting for this....great game! I am addicted to playing it on my boyfriend's phone now I can play it whenever I want. plus its great for passing time.
B006PTL1QM|5.0|Very interesting picture about the relationship between Freud and Jung.<br /><br />The debate is still on if Jung became a quack. Any Freudian would say he did, but there may be people out there that had successful treatment with Jung's methods so it is hard for a layman like me to make the call.<br /><br />As much as Cronenberg intended to make this movie as universal as possible, I suspect that you may only enjoy this one if you have some basic knowledge about Freud, Jung, maybe Wagner and psychoanalysis in general. Then you will really have a great time.<br /><br />I highly recommend listening to Cronenberg's comments on the DVD. He gave tremendous insight to the story, adding very relevant information to the scenes. He sounded like a true scholar.
B0086700CM|3.0|this is a great game however on my droid x the play lags constantly so it misses my commands.  its sucks cuz you really cant play it.  no lag at all on the ipod so it must be the android release.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire &amp; this app allows me to play anywhere. it has lots of different features &amp; challenging games.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|This new album captures a groovy feel that flows from one song into the next.  No real singles on the album, shortest song is almost 8 minutes and longest is 12 minutes.  Chris is so talented and that shines in all his work.<br /><br />Fans of the Crowes last few albums with love this and it definitely should not be missed.  Catch them live to get the full experience, but this is a close second.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key was an excellent book, I highly recommend it.<br />This was one of those books that was hard to put down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|yeehaw! it was very fun. it kept me very entertained. even my kids like it. its cool too that its free!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I ordered this movie since I've seen all the previous MI movies.  Sat in my living room with amenities and watched a great movie from beginning to end with the action scenes taking my breath away.
1439181780|1.0|The same words over and over and over again. \\"feel\\". \\"love\\" \\"feel\\" \\"love\\". Couldnt finish this book.  It just wasnt my kind of thing.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Great classic movie!I could watch this show over and over again. I watched it through Amazon Direct and everything went well. No complaints here.
030758836X|5.0|Boy and girl meet. Boy and girl fall in love. Boy and girl get married. Five years later, on their anniversary, girl goes missing and boy is the prime suspect. To tell you more would be to ruin all the fun, but if there's one thing you can be sure of when reading Gillian Flynn, it's that nothing is ever as it seems.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to write a more in depth synopsis of this book without giving away too much of the plot, so I'm going to leave it there. The surprises are the best parts of Flynn's work and I wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Flynn's work, GONE GIRL will join the ranks of SHARP OBJECTS and DARK PLACES in your list of favorites. If you're new to Flynn, I envy the heck out of you. She's one of the authors I wish I could read again for the first time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this game sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much its my addictive game I cant put down. Ummm so what else am I supposed to say about this game, um its kinda creepy. you should update it to were the player can be a running zombie. worth 30000$ in the game. dude just n say'n.
0062197258|5.0|Catherine Bailey still hasn't met Mr. Right, but she believed her luck might finally have turned when she met Lee Brightman. Four years later, she still hasn't recovered from the horrors she experienced at Lee's hands. Lee is serving a three year sentence after leaving her for dead and Catherine, now Cathy, is trying to make progress with each new day. Even days, odd days, cloudy days, each requires something different. Some days she can barely leave her apartment. Others, she's ok as long as she checks the doors and windows. Cathy needs to feel safe. But when Lee is released, Cathy knows that she may never feel safe again.<br /><br />Whoa! INTO THE DARKEST CORNER is dark and it's twisted, but once you start, you're not going to want to put this one down.<br /><br />Elizabeth Haynes's debut thriller is definitely a bit like Sleeping With the Enemy with a little twist. Cathy suffers from serious OCD and PTSD as a result of Lee's violence. Haynes alternates between Catherine at the beginning of - and through - her relationship with Lee and the three years later Cathy, making clear just how much she's changed. The girl who was once a partier with a horde of close friends becomes a loner who cringes at close contact. And as her situation worsens with Lee, it also becomes clear how much strength it's taken for her to survive the whole thing, pointing to an inevitable climactic ending that Haynes delivers 100%.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I gave the story 5 stars but it cost to much for everything and we barley get money how do we get our dollars if we work hard and cook and don't give money or dollors it is to much same for all the story's.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|please make more! love this game. i beat all the levels and then it told me i finished. went back to my home screen and where it used to say world 9 level 2 it now says 'new game' because i finished 2-5 on world 9. i dont want to start all over....new levels please(:
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Wonderful product for great price! The digital copy is wonderful...I can take it with me everywhere and the bluray is clear and great picture!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This is just a simply superb, incredibly good work from the Beach Boys. There is not a weak moment on it - everything is wonderful - the lyrics, melodies, vocals, the entire production. They put together a truly complete masterpiece and frankly, I'm amazed because it is so good plus it is lots of fun to listen to. I was thinking maybe because of their age that the vocals might be a bit ragged or the musicianship sloppy, but no, it's all great. It has the distinctive Beach Boys sound that takes me back to my much younger days and it's all done so very, very well. If you like the Beach Boys, you have GOT to get this CD; it's one that you can listen to over and over and not have to skip tracks, either.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best app I have ever down loaded. The graphics are spot on and the game is REALLY fun! And its FREE! I 100% recommend this app.
B007R41E8O|4.0|great graphics and story.  good hidden object and scene to scene chase.  BUT unexpected - unexplained - and annoying ending.
1594481717|3.0|Written just before the big crash of 2008, Mr. Pink's premise speaks to designers, conceptual workers, inventors, artists in many fields are the ones who will reap the best jobs, and technical and manufacturing jobs have and will continue to go overseas. The second half of the premise is certainly accurate; he expounds why for most of us who don't understand the current jobs market trends and the ridiculous political stance of some candidates who claim they can \\"make\\" jobs happen. The first part would mean that \\"high touch\\" companies who create individualized products, create meaningful products that are valuable over lifetimes (plural), create an experience that is priceless or create totally new products that people don't even know how to use as yet - theses companies should be flourishing. NOT! Because of the downturn, most people are very, very shy of innovation or investment in something new. Mr. Pink's premise is encouraging, but unfortunately old news and wishful thinking (due to politics and economy). I'd love to read an update of his book, to see what he predicts for 2013 and beyond.
B0086700CM|2.0|this game totally sucks. I played it for 10 minutes and then deleted it. screw temple run. plus it lags way to much
B007EW9ISM|5.0|This device is great for both touch / select with is compressable tip, but also works well sliding across the screen for notes or rough sketching like a whiteboard marker.  Many other touch stylus tips I tried fail to balance the ability to do both.<br />I also like the heft and weight of the stylus.  Highly recommended!
B0086700CM|5.0|Probably the most fun and addictive game on a mobile device. It's my go-to game on the Android. I highly recommend it.
B00529J7JE|5.0|Excellant Album Simply Andrea Corr at her best. Doing something different than what she did with the band The Corrs.Definatly top of the line work.
B005HWUBZ0|3.0|The reviewer that dubbed this \\"Easy Listening Soul\\" pretty much nailed it. Nice songs, nice voice, nice arrangements, but nothing terrible inventive or amazing on here. I don't want to sound too negative because I did enjoy this album. But for some reason, his previous album \\"Strange Arrangement,\\" impressed me a lot more. On this one, it sounds like he's running in place, using the same formula, and not really taking any chances. Again, it all SOUNDS quite nice, and the \\"retro soul\\" thing he is doing is very admirable, but there's something missing from these songs that prevents it from being a truly great album. More sweat and pain perhaps?
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an amazing product, quality is good.<br />Lots of pockets, have did little of travelling  with this, seems to be comfortable.<br />Can also accomodate an IPAD.<br />Now need to buy stuff to fill up all the pockets :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app it is so fun and keeps me busy while in the car or tracking!!!:) so fun love it you should get it
B0063IH60K|4.0|Entertaining  and challening games.  Will keep your mind active. Great for when you want to play a quick and not boring game.
