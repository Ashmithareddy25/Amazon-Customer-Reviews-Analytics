B00E9P959O|3.0|I can now listen to the entire thing without getting a headache. The original mastering was just awful, as everyone knows. This mix is much better and I can hear the songs for what they were intended to be. That said, the songs as a whole are average to good. Not Rush's best work. There are some really good moments, but the songs lack something, be it a keyboard part here or there, a well placed guitar solo, or even one of Peart's patented extended drum breaks.

B0098460O4|5.0|I absolutely love them and their story and accidentally found them on youtube with their &#34;best audition ever&#34; on Britain's Got Talent. I could watch that over and over! A big fan of theirs and so very happy to get the CD although at times, like others say, orchestra too loud but love it anyway.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|I love all of Cher's albums and this one did not disappoint!  I can't get enough of it.  Even though Woman's World is the hit, it's not even my favorite.  I am in love with I Walk Alone, and I Hope You Find It.  Don't get me wrong I have played it non-stop for a week now and love every song on it, but those 2 are my favorite so far.<br />I you like Cher, you won't be disappointed...

B004VMUS9G|4.0|Recently on vacation we had to get up early in order to catch our 7:30 a.m. plane. I had no alarm clock and as a result did not sleep well. Normally I tend to wake up early and do not need an alarm but it made me change my mind and I hurried to get this app. This one starts softly and will slowly increase its sound.

B00CZAYOWI|5.0|I LOVED the Cult's Love album. I still do. It's still one of my favorite records of all time. one of those 5 albums on a desert island choices. So when Electric came out, stripped of all the mysticism and surrealism of Love, sounding more like The Free and Steppenwolf than one of the greatest bands to ever emerge from the punk/new wave/goth era, I was not a happy listener. They redeemed themselves somewhat with Sonic Temple, which harkened back to the more psychedelic sounds of the late 60s, although it still was no Love....<br /><br />Then I find out the story behind Electric  ,and why it sounded so different, and now I understand.<br />I also understand they were still the band I  loved when they went in to record the follow up to Love. If you've been waiting since 1986 for a follow up to Love , here it is.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|I chose this book because I consider myself to be an introvert, but I wanted to know how I fit into the corporate culture.  Cain explained why I have been able to get up in front of a group even though I really was not comfortable.  She helped me understand myself better, so that I can be a real contributor in an organization full of confident extroverts.  All career tests have pointed me in the direction of a librarian, or a computer programmer.  This book will give you the encouragement you need to show that introverts can fit into any organization or career that you enjoy.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|One Story<br />It is often said that most authors really have only one story.  In the Khaled Hosseini's books set in Afghanistan, the reader encounters stories of children who have been severed from their families. The structure of And the Mountains Echoed differs from his previous two books but the story is the same.<br /> In the Kite Runner a boy loses his half-brother and then moves to the USA. As an adult, the boy returns to Afghanistan to search for the lost son of his deceased half-brother.  The lost nephew is found and then forms a new family with his uncle in America.<br /> In A Thousand Splendid Suns, fifteen-year-old Marian loses her family when given in marriage to a brutal older man. The second plot of the book concerns Laila whose family dies when a bomb destroys her home.  The two plots are linked when Laila and Marian meet and eventually become each other's family.<br /> And the Mountains Echoed continues Hosseini's exploration of lost children.  This novel, however, is more complex due to multiple plots, geographic locations, and nonsequential chapters. Like his previous novels, each plot is linked, in this case by the various members and acquaintances of one Afghan family. It opens with a fable told by the Afghan father of Pari and Abdullah.  The fable mirrors the real-life situation of this impoverished family by telling of a desperate father who must sacrifice his beloved son in order to save the rest of the family from a monster. In actuality, Pari's father is sacrificing his daughter to save her from a life of privation. The family is traveling to Kabul to give away the three year old to a wealthy woman who is unable to conceive The loss and terror of the fable is magnified when Abdullah awakens at night at their desert camping spot and cannot find his father.  Because of the darkness, vastness, and coldness of the desert, Abdullah is tramatized before his father returns to him and his little sister, Pari. From this point, Hosseini's book amplifies multiple cases of suffering due to lost connections with family members.<br />The broken bonds are caused by basically five circumstances: 1) Necessity, as in the case of Pari, 2) Alienation from a parent figure due to the parent's lack of moral courage, crimes, or personality, 3) Loss of parents due to murder or suicide, 4) Desertion by the parent or parental figure, and 5) Loss of a parent due to old age or disease.  The conclusion of the epic dwells on reunions of family members which are, because of the number of years that have intervened, bittersweet. Afghanistan history is only a back drop for the stories. The stories move from Paris to Greece to America and back to the tumultuous Afghanistan. This novel showcases Hosseini's ability to juggle complicated and intriguing switches and links to families across the globe who suffer familial separation and then experience some measure of recovery. I don't think this novel will preempt The Kite Runner in popularity, but it definitely is a book to add to your collection of great novels.
B009PK9SB8|1.0|The touch screen is nice for play back, but the touch screen itself isn't very responsive. Every time is try and use the touch back it takes severel try's for the screen to responde. Along the bottom is the worst. It doesn't responde to your finger or finger nail. Over not a good chose. Unless my screen is defective.  It would nice if there was a way to calibrate the touch screen.  But I don't think there is.

B0082RHRHC|5.0|I actually never wanted to read this book because of the stupid movies I've suffered through that are based on this novel but I love reading Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell and when I regretfully finished all her fiction novels I read her biography about Charlotte Bronte.  That got me curious about her novels, her life is very interesting, she suffered much as a child but also was very sheltered as an adult with very few friends so it made me curious what she would write.  It turned out the novel was entrancing to me and I'm on my 3rd read through.  It was nice to have the audible book to play in the car also as it proved very enjoyable on a long trip that I had to make.
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|I've come to rely on Amazon to do a lot of online purchases as well as price shopping and comparisons . Even for items I'm used to buying offline I now sometimes buy online. This app though is not complete. It's missing things I find essential, like being able to view existing gift card balances & adding gift card codes directly into my account. It's often easier to just log in to Amazon via a mobile web browser.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a film that, between the theater, this Blu-Ray, and finding it on TV, I must have watched dozens of times. It's a blast from start to finish, and this Blu-Ray brings that experience to life in crisp, incredible HD detail. The film looks as good as it ever did, and the set comes with a Blu-Ray, a DVD, and a digital copy of the film, for use in any situation.<br /><br />But believe me, you'll want to use the Blu-Ray copy of the film the most, because not only does it contain the movie, but it also has hours upon hours of special features just waiting for the next movie geek to watch obsessively. This includes four different commentary tracks (two by different cast members, one by Wright and the writers about the story, and one by Wright and the cinematographer about the technical aspects of the film), deleted scenes, bloopers, the original ending, a short cartoon, production blogs, and so much more. I've gone through each special feature extensively, and they are must-sees for any fan of the film who wants to get more in-depth with the experience. They're also eye-opening and interesting from the perspective of an aspiring filmmaker, as the film does some incredibly unconventional things with its narrative and with its camera work that would be beneficial to anybody trying to learn more about the craft.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World will undoubtedly satisfy any fan of the film, and may even convert the uninitiated who've never seen it before. It's one of the prize possessions of my Blu-Ray collection, and it's a great purchase for anybody who likes the hyperkinetic, zany madness that is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The main reason for getting this was so I could watch on my TV what was on my chrome browser. But it doesn't work as I expected. You need to refresh each browser screen.

B00BMR4RIG|3.0|The application comes in a slide menu where you can swipe to get different weather forecasts. Weather for the day, 5day forecast, hourly forecast, and at the last slide they offer to purchase additional apps. This the advertisement. The application turns on your GPS in order to retrieve your location so it knows which city to give you the forecast for. It retrieves data from underground.com I find this application of little use, specially knowing other apps give the same or better informational services for free. Always remember having your GPS turned on, will swallow your battery energy.

0385341008|5.0|Had just returned from an all too brief visit to Guernsey (St. Peter Port) on a cruise and I loved the place and was therefore curious to read the book which through a series of letters describes life there during the German occupation and afterwards.  The mixed nature of that occupation, running from extremes of barbarism to touching acts of compassion was interesting to read.

6305910340|5.0|Patzer. I have not heard that word since my days on my high school chess team. I have always wanted to see SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER and somehow just seemed to miss it. I finally caught it on the Sundance Channel and have watched at least 3 times now. This film was worth the wait. Let me tell you. This is a great film. You don't have to like Chess. You don't even have to play Chess. Yes, this film lets you into that world that I was once part of, but better yet, it separates men and boys who have that higher level of insight into the game, it separates them by their passion and honor and dedication for the game and for those mere mortals who play the game on that same field. What is the purpose of the game? I think the film asks that question. And I think the film answers it aptly. I remember once at a tournament that I offered my opponent a draw even though it was evident that I had clearly beaten him. I overheard that if my opponent did not win or draw he was off his school's team. When I watched SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER that all came back to me. That is what this excellent film is about.
B00371XIJE|5.0|How we ought to be as spouses, parents, children, siblings, friends, neighbors, colleagues, etc., is condensed in the soul of a little doggie in this movie. What is amazing about it is that the movie is based on a true story, something that can exist even in this world.  I also enjoyed this movie because I grew up in Japan and used to meet up with my friends around Hachiko's statue at Shibuya Station. There, Hachiko sits and waits among hundreds of others who do the same. :))
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I had wanted to see this in the theatre , but didn't make it.  After seeing the DVD, I am not sorry I didn't pay for a ticket.  It was an attempt to draw in the Twilight fans, ( I am a Twilight Mom ) and did do that to a certain extent.  The plot and story line are a little simplistic, but it really is just light hearted , fun movie.  I would probably watch it again in the future.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Very funny and very well written. The main character is so funny and if you have been around academics recognisable!

B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Tedeschi / Trucks is such a fine combo, with a huge band and inspiring music. All the musicians - 12 in total<br />in this band seem to gel, and all are in sync with each other...it's a great free flowing bunch of emotions and fun!<br />The lyrics are awesome. As usual, Derek's slide and lead guitar is amazing. Susan Tedeschi's voice is so soulful!<br />This is right up there with the best of their stuff!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Have always loved this artists music.  Enjoyed the album and hope to purchase more CD's to add to my collection.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|I am impressed again at the musicianship and drive from Stephen Stills.<br />His vocals are still cutting it after all these years. Some good rockin tunes,<br />and very much fun and satisfying to hear...Play it LOUD!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love the app so far but ......The last few days I have been getting the message to upgrade or I will not be able to log in soon.  Then it takes me to the Google Play Store which is not compatible with Kindle.  So now what?
B001KL3GWM|4.0|Trucks is an amazing musician...He gets better and better.<br />The Tedeschi / Trucks band is now one of my favorites.<br />This one is 2009 and contains great tunes, harmonies, instrumental solos and of course nice guitar.<br />This is one is very much worth listening to.

B00C8S9VKM|3.0|This kind of book, skipping from subject to subject without much logic, is basically what could be unkindly referred to as a 'cut-and-paste job'.  As such, it is decently well done, but I have read better about the 1920s, notably Frederick Lewis Allen's Only Yesterday (1931), which Bryson himself cites, and Geoffrey Perret's America in the Twenties (1983), which among other things contains a much more detailed and comprehensive discussion of the Sacco and Vanzetti case than Bryson's.
B00FKE3H0G|5.0|This album is great. The songs really connect with the listener. Some are upbeat and get your body moving, others are mellow and just great to sing along with. Love this new Miley and love her new work. You won't be disappointed.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was such an amazing read. I had a hard time putting it down. Beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book.

B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I've played a couple decent games, but they're all the same and and for in-game purchasing; which I absolutely hate. This is the answer. A little bit like faster than light, but far more detailed and with plenty of reasons to replay. In a nut-shell this was a kick-starter and highly anticipated, and I'd like to thank amazon for fulfilling my request and picking it up.<br />  Thanks Amazon.<br />  Steve.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Not a big fan of comic books so not much background. But movie was action packed, easy to follow. And, great production values. Every dollar spent on it  was on the screen.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I would have to say this album is my new favorite Korn album.  Prior to this album it was Untouchables.  This album has something for EVERY Korn fan!  It's a mesh of old and new and perfectly blended to create a new sound that is pleasing to fans that prefer the older stuff and fans that prefer the newer stuff.  I highly recommend this album for all Korn fans!  Play this for those friends of yours that don't like Korn but don't tell them who it is...see what happens! :)

B000002GAF|5.0|I grew up with this on vinyl and it is one of my all time favorites. Truly an amazing display of musicianship and absolutely great tunes. I listen to the commercial hit, I Just Want To Stop, hardly ever because the rest of the record is so great and in my opinion better than the &#34;hit&#34;. Love the Vannelli brothers' work. Truly worth having.

B004AQR29C|4.0|Funny, hilarious and spoof on 'action' movies.  Easy on the senses and the rhetoric as well as cast of characters are fun to watch.
B0046BQ06W|5.0|One of my favorite albums by them. Such a shame they split up and hope they get back together. My Chemical Romance is one of the few bands that have consistently released great albums. Their first album I'm not so fond of, but they really brought it together with each album after that. I took my teenage son to see them live in Hollywood a few years ago and dragged my husband along and I must say they put on an incredible show live. I have this album digitally but with the resurgence of vinyl we decided to get it.
B005MMZ63C|1.0|Just terrible. I endured it to hoping to find out why people may like it.<br />There is nothing interesting or appealing about it. (Unless you are studying the history of movie making and want to quantify how much we've progressed since the time it was made)<br />Given that the Kardashians is a popular TV show, and that George W Bush was voted twice into office, I resigned to the fact that I will never understand or be able to predict popular public opinion.
0316322407|5.0|This book is an inspirational read, for everyone, but particularly for young girls.  It reminds us  how critical it is to support women around the world as they flight for their right to get an education. As an aside, I also saw her interview on the Daily Show today. Talk about poise, strength and courage--she personifies all three of these qualities like no one else!  I will use the word again, for the second time in this review, both both the author and her book-- Inspirational!

B0014JLYS8|5.0|After spending about $100 a year of crappy work shoes (two pairs a year) offered by the grocery store where I work, I found these to be much more durable, comfortable, affordable, and altogether better work shoe.<br /><br />They meet industry standards for non slip sole, and a heel.  If you are food service and work in a bar, kitchen, or in a service dept. at grocery store, these are the bees knees.<br /><br />The material (what crocs are made out off) is very supportive and comfy.  They have a reasonably higher arch than most crocs, a beaded massaging interior for comfort that rocks.  Also, they have the highest standard of slip resistant soles available, as well as a heel strap that constitutes a heel to meet industry regulations.<br /><br />The are all one piece, so the shoe's layers will not come apart with wear and tear.<br />They is no cloth, absorbent material to hold sweat, and they can be cleaned with bleach and water for sanitation.<br />Obviously the are anti-microbial.<br /><br />These crocs are super comfortable and don't flatten out.(I weigh about 275 - 5'11, and my feet do not swell, and ache after work.)<br /><br />2 pairs of crocs cost me around $60 in 18 months, vs $100 every 12 months for two crappy pairs of a work &#34;recommended&#34; brand.<br />$50 savings and a much better product than what I use to use for work.<br /><br />These are perfect in every way.<br />They have saved me money, about $50 a year.(I replace them only because the slip resistant sole wears down around the edges)<br />(MORE ABOUT THAT WORN SOLE IN THE SIZING INFO IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!)<br />They have increased my comfort for long shifts at work.

B00B7PIRIE|1.0|The only way I could write a review on this item was to click on an undeserved star! It does not deserve it. I ordered this set twice as the first set was defective. I wound up accidentally with three sets. None of the three sets was watchable. They froze and jumped around constantly. Shame on Amazon for continuing to sell such inferior merchandise! Since I ran into this issue I've seen many negative reviews but it is still being sold. To add insult to injury I was being charged a restocking fee for something that belonged in the trash. Amazon did reimburse the restocking fee but they are still selling this inferior product. Please take it off the market until a working DVD can be produced.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very nice.  Works well on my Kindle, and very easy to use.  Unlike most similar apps this one actually does what it says.  when ive used other similar apps and would run the app twice in a row, the second time would show the same things over and over.  this clears first time.  Sweet
B00E9O6C96|4.0|First, a brief profile of the author. I'm an \\"aspiring\\" audiophile, rather than an aficionado, so I try to use good equipment but with realistic expectations due to my needs and budget.<br /><br />The portable music player I was using until purchasing the X3 was a popular Sony MP3 player, from their NWZ series, coupled with a pair of Etymotic HF5 headphones.<br /><br />The first impressions of using the X3:<br /><br />1) The level of details is much higher. Any recording imperfections are also much better reproduced (as expected). Just to give you an idea: in some of the recordings, including the samples that come with the player, the microphone line noise was very obvious. At first, I thought that the X3 had an issue but then I checked and I could vaguely hear the same noise while using other ways of playing the same files.<br /><br />2) The bass details and the dynamic range (bass to high) sound good to me, much much better than on the little Sony player. I used the same files on both players to evaluate this.<br /><br />3) The mid and high range sounded clear to me. On the other player, the passages with intense highs sounded hard to distinguish.<br /><br />4) After 2 hours of listening to music at approximately half the volume there was no ear fatigue, unlike with the other player.<br /><br />5) The X3 is very big and heavy compared with the other player so it's not good for using at the gym, for example.<br /><br />6) The X3's user interface is rudimentary - somewhat slow, unpolished and simplistic. There's no way to search. The file names scroll very slowly, even with the latest firmware. The buttons are somewhat difficult to use while in the dark, especially if the X3's cover is on it, although this might get better with practice.<br /><br />7) Obviously, in addition to the X3's capabilities, the quality of the listening experience will also be affected by the quality of the recordings and by the headphones. I could only experiment with the first, by playinghigh quality mp3s vs flacs and music from different labels. The biggest difference I found so far was due to the quality of the recordings, rather than the file format (surprising to me).<br /><br />8) The player froze twice in the first two days of using it. First with the firmware the device came with and second with the latest firmware. This is very hard to swallow so I'm considering returning the device if this happens again.<br /><br />9) The user documentation has some issues and requires editing by a native English speaker. The X3 documentation appears to be unavailable on Fiio's web site (!).

B004U8VX2M|5.0|I glimpse of history of old England. Very interesting for history buffs.  The changes that were made from that time are astounding.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Same goes for this one. As much as I do like Angry Birds this one isn't my favorite either. I feel like it takes too long to master the different levels.
6301966740|5.0|Purists pooh pooh colorized films.  As long time fan of Casablanca with several versions of it in B&W I always wanted to see the colorized version.  The movie was a new experience- not better or worse- just different in perspective<br />I don't know if Color would have been used originally if affordable or common place - and am sure filming in B&W would require some changes in camera use than Color.  I do know the story did not change nor did the quality of actors and for a new experience I enjoyed the Colorized version even on VHS
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great app when you're just killing time.  I enjoy puzzles so this was a fun app for me. Not too challenging... mindless entertainment after a long work day.

B007T967X4|2.0|I was hoping this would be a fun learning game for my music students but if the game won't let me select notes and I watch in anguish as they turn to errors, I have to put the game up. It doesn't work. It's broken.<br /><br />The fun interface and cat character are very appealing so it has promise. As a musician I find it disheartening that I can't hear the notes as I select them ...the fun background music is unrelated in time and pitch from my actions. What's notation without relevance?<br />NG
B000OCXIDK|2.0|An interesting look into the painting style and techniques of Vermeer, and into the daily life in a small city in Holland in the 1660s.  However, I was less than convinced by the basic premise of the plot, that the main character (the girl, named Griet in the novel) would have had the hots for the married-with-lots-of-children, cold-as-ice Vermeer.  So while I enjoyed the setting and admired the writing, I think the \\"plot\\" (such as it was; it never really went anywhere) was very contrived.  2½ stars.

B00BB22GSU|1.0|I had to order this 2 times because the first record I got was scratched and it skipped. I thought alright it's probably just a bad record and I'll send it back. When I received the second one, I played it and that one skipped too! It wasn't as bad as the first one but I couldn't even listen to the songs. I will never buy records on here again.

Brilliant is too tame a word for this book, and the series it participates  in.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is a fun, challenging, worthwhile timewaster that gets you hooked after the first few levels. I love the concept, and it is very easy to entertain you and others, including younger siblings due to the easy plot of the game. This may not be one of the best, but it is sure great to come back to again and again, with new challenges around every corner. Also, for an even bigger challenge, I recommend Flow: Bridges.

1416972242|4.0|I am going to be honest after I read the city of bones I threw the book across the room! I so upset about Clary and Jace being brother and sister that I almost didn't read this book. I started reading it because when I had nothing else to read, but the book surprised me. Cassandra is such a great writer that she knows how to pull you in with her twists and turns within the story that you cant put the book down. Even though I am not happy with the relationship between Clary and Jace I can say that I am enjoying the sires and that I am looking forward to the city of glass. The sires is worth reading!

1596438274|2.0|I have read many a graphic novel in my time, and when I heard they made one about Richard Feynman, it instantly caught my attention. Before reading, I did not know much about Mr. Feynman, but I had heard many good things and I was really excited to begin learning!  After reading stories like [[ASIN:0141014083 Maus: A Survivor's Tale]], [[ASIN:0770437494 Mission in a Bottle: The Honest Guide to Doing Business Differently--and Succeeding]], [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]], and [[ASIN:1596438134 Delilah Dirk and the Turkish Lieutenant]], I have learned that the graphic novel format is not only an excellent way to get people to read, but also, with the right combination of beautiful illustrations and well-chosen words, can be used to enhance the story itself and become a literary masterpiece!  Imagine my disappointment when I actually read Feynman. ---- Before reading on, I wish to clarify that the topic and idea for this book are very good, and that many people who are already familiar with Feynman's life have read and enjoyed this work. And many who are not familiar with graphic novels, have also approved. But sadly, the expectations I had for this book, for a person familiar with this form of writing, fell short. I was hoping for it to shine and entertain, just like so many reviewers on Amazon have claimed it would.  The book itself is good on principle. It does what it claims it would do: teach you about Richard Feynman while using images. And for that, it's perfect. But my disappointment does not lie in the topic, but how it was presented and accomplished. ---- The Writing  -I believe that the writing itself was lacking. It almost seemed like the words were copy and pasted from one of Feynman's lectures and quickly edited. The lack of transitions really makes it a hard read. I found myself constantly re-reading things to fully understand what had happened, and how he got from point A to point B in the story. Many times while reading, they would touch upon an interesting topic, I would turn the page and they would have moved on to a new setting and part of Feynman's life. It appears that they were trying to condense Feynman's whole life's work into one reasonably sized graphic novel, but to do so they had to sacrifice details and transitions. Just to give you some perspective, his wedding took up less than a page, and the next scene he was abruptly back at work in a meeting to design the atomic bomb.  The Art  - I understand illustrating a 260 page book can be a daunting task and very difficult to do well, but considering the quality of the illustrations of the other lengthy graphic novels I've read, I was sadly disappointed. Usually one of the best things about reading a graphic novel is to be able to admire the art in addition to the writing. But for this book, I did not feel that this was the case. It appears that doodling is Mr. Myrick's style. Nothing is made to scale, or well-proportioned. He laughs at the thought of perspective. It literally looks like each page took five minutes to draw. It does not look like there were thumbnails, sketches, inking, fine tuning or any planning that I realize I have taken for granted in other graphic novels. It was a piece of paper, a pen, and five minutes. At least for me, I do not appreciate this artist's style, but maybe there was a greater reason for choosing this style that was lost on me.  - While I'm not a fan of this artist's style, I would have been more forgiving if the art made the writing easier to understand. Usually the pictures in a graphic novel are used in part to illustrate complicated concepts in a way that makes it easier for the reader to comprehend. I had hoped that this graphic novel would help make Feynman's theories more accessible to readers. Sadly, despite reading and re-reading, I feel that some concepts were way over my head, and not enough time or effort was spent in trying to explain them with words or imagery.  The Coloring?  -There is no shading, at all. Itappears that all the coloring was done with the fill button on MS Paint. I do not quite understand why they needed a separate person to color. ---- Honestly I feel that the only redeeming quality this book truly had was the topic itself. The reason this book stands out is because it is about Richard Feynman. Not the writing, art, or coloring, but the fact that it is based on an incredible person. In my opinion, if you truly wish to learn more about this fascinating man who never ceases to amaze, read his autobiography, [[ASIN:0393316041 Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)]], which is what inspired this graphic novel in the first place.  I hope this review helped to give a different perspective.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie. action packed. Hulk, Thor and ironman rock. The scene at the end during the credits is cute. Looking forward to follow on movies in the series.
B00A3AU9KI|4.0|Great charger!  Would be better if the cord curled so it would take less space. I still recommend as a reliable charger.
0802473156|5.0|I buy this gift for every wedding shower I attend.  I have also given several copies out to friends who were going through a rough patch in their marriage/relationship.  To me, this is a must read! It's really all about being able to communicate love to your spouse/partner in a way that makes them feel loved (we are all different!).  I guarantee this will change your relationship for the better!  Plus you don't even have to read the whole book.  Just take the quiz and have your spouse/partner take the quiz--then read both of those chapters!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|First, I have to confess I have only read 60% of this book so far - no reflection on its quality, just a lack of time on my part.<br /><br />The author shows a very positive side to introversion, that introverts can and do contribute a great deal even though in the modern world seems to be biased towards extroversion.<br /><br />She details a huge amount of research into many aspects of introversion and extroversion including cultural differences, stress in the workplace and career suitability, handling of conflict, whether introverts can, or should, be more extroverted when called for, and much more.<br /><br />There are many fascinating ideas in the first 60% of this book and I am sure 40% more to come too! I highly recommend it.

B003Q6D2B4|1.0|this story line belongs in a nut house.worst movie have ever viewed totally fantasy land. should be sent to the trash pile.and copies burned at the stake. totally garbage.
B00FN8HS5O|4.0|Steven Price created a score that is far different from the experience of a Hans Zimmer score.  If you have seen the movie the score will trigger instant connections to certain film scenes by it's distinct cues.  At times the soundtrack is incredibly calming while certain tracks convey the nerve racking anxiety that was evoked during the film.<br /><br />I recommend seeing the film first so the listener will benefit from the context of the scenes in the movie.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|It is a great film. It is unusual that problems that all families have are shown in a common way, without making a drama. There is a chance for everybody to walk on with their limits that in fact exists for everybody.<br />Great performances as is well known.<br />Ivonne-Uruguay
B0045EDY0A|5.0|For me, when I want to listen to Pearl Jam I gravitate towards this album.  Others are more experimental, have their place and are appreciated for what they are.  This I find to be the most enjoyable.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />No Way<br />Given to Fly<br />Wishlist<br />Do the Evolution<br />Low Light
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was thinking that I could finally stop carrying around 5 different cables to connect my various devices to a TV.  Chromecast was the perfect solution!  No more wires, lots of devices connecting to 1 connector, HDMI quality even.  But Google decided to take a page from the iTunes book, and only allow you to &#34;cast&#34; certain things from certain apps.  YouTube?  no problem.  Pay for something from google play?  excellent!  Have a video you shot with your phone you want to show on a tv?  nope - you're out of luck.
1476727651|5.0|I was concerned Danny's adulthood might not do justice to his traumatic childhood, but King has done another excellent job of conveying the very real practicalities of human psychology in that Danny learned to cope with his problems in the same way many of us do: the bottle. So many of these reviews popped up within an hour of the book's official delivery and were likely sitting, already written, on some douchebag's computer screen just waiting for the book to drop. Doctor Sleep is almost everything I could have hoped for and it is clear the author didn't just churn this book out for the sake of a big payday. It feels like he's been thinking about Danny for as long as the rest of us. I was glad to see Tony alive and kicking. Here's hoping whomever buys the rights to this novel doesn't turn it into another Kubrick bastardization.
B0073PZIBQ|5.0|This movie is not about the birds.  While birds hold the theme of the movie together, it is definitely about relationships and how the choices we make detemine there future.  A great watch.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Best movie in ALL the land! Every emotion you can think of was great. Singing was great and I'm definitely a music snob lol
B004RVCIEO|5.0|LOVE Interpol. this is my fav album. Worth the investment. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Having never read Gaiman before, the first few pages swallowed me up. A story of a normal boy dragged into events he will never fully understand. But read for yourself, a simple yet enchanting story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. The only problem, is nothing! When I saw,the game I could not believe it was free. It is. Aewsome
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|I don't like the pages layout of this app.  It would be better if it either made use of a menu button or side bar menu.<br /><br />I also don't like that it has a very iOS feel to it.  The more apps page is an eyesore that are too the idea that this is just a port from iOS.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Ah the Shining...... \\"honey, I'm home\\"<br />Dr. Sleep picks up on Danny Torrence and the life spawned by a childhood full of ghosties phantoms drugs and alcohol.<br />Simply the best follow up anyone could have hoped for, read this book.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|A wonderful story.  Unforgettable songs. I loved watching this great movie. Carol Burnett is great.  It is a timeless classic.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider is a lot of fun to play. Touch and jump cards make the game easier. I enjoy it. Very challenging game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. Chromecast has made my life so much easier. I just mainly use it with my laptop because the iphone app sucks.<br /><br />At first, the connection was really slow and sometimes the Chromecast would lose its connection completely even with the HDMI cable that came with it. It was quite frustrating because sometimes the audio would get delayed, video would get delayed, dropped connection, etc. it was just unwatchable at time.<br /><br />Before giving up on it, I decided to get a newer wi-fi router (Apple Airport Extreme) and it solved everything. Now it plays super smooth and never loses its connection with my laptop. Best 35 bucks I've ever spent.
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|I like this game the game company always delivers nice game,I just don't like how when u get done battling you lose all your troops even through you won and that's a lil annoying but other than that it's cool! :)
B007ZMHBBM|5.0|Great DVD!  The performances of all the players is incredible!  It's like being in back of the club sitting at the bar watching the show.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love all of Diana Gabaldon's books, especially the &#34;Outlander&#34; series.  I can't put them down - I just want to keep<br />reading to see what is going to happen.  I also like the fact that they are historical fiction.  Keep them coming!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like the colorful picture on the screen (but personally feel the bright pink blossoms are just wrong for the fall season)  but I really feel the set up is a bit strange now.  I do like the ability to update/refresh it though.  I will probably adjust...I just don't understand the need people seem to have to fix things that don't need fixed!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and easy doesn't look like the old card game I was used to buy can't say exactly what it is. Of course I don't like adds buy I guess you have to expect that with a free app.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|My cd was in Perfect shape! Shipped here fast. Love it so much!!!! If you're an open minded music listener, give them a try. Amazing!!!
0486448843|5.0|I love these postcards so much and plan to keep them instead of sending them out. And the price is reasonable.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Not enough time to tell if it works but it seems to give great advice based on scientific fact. The book gives a lengthy account of the science, so if you are happy to read the details, I would recommend. I so hope it works but I am looking forward to finishing the book and trying it.
3836538725|5.0|A great selection of very impressive photos. Its a big book which is needed to really show off quality photographs. I agree with one reviewer that some of the photos are not framed well but all in all a very impressive collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book actually teaches you how to communicate with someone totally opposite of yourself.  Yes, there is a lot of sex, but I if you look past that, you can actually learn how to make a relationship better with communication.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|This was the best season of the Big Bang Theory. There were so many excellent episodes in this season. My personal favorite is The Barbarian Sublimination,\\" where Sheldon gets Penny addicted to online gaming. Another great one was when Raj became an ego maniac after he is selected to be featured in People Magazine, causing the rest of the gang to hate him. If you can't afford to buy it, borrow it. You'll be laughing for a long time.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I am certainly no deep thinking critic of writing, plot, etc., but Castle is a no-miss show for us and gets top marks.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Funny, funny movie. I think geared for older kids, but smaller ones seem to get the humour too. Carell's voice is perfect in the main role and actually the supporting voices are also terrific. Fun storyline, animation is superb, highly recommend.
B00985E3UG|3.0|Scary with regards to how big business is dictating what we eat with no regard to obesity and subsequent illnesses. Possibly to much  scientific information about salt, fat, and sugar.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The pleasure I had reading this book is probably close to the fun these word-warriors had as they generated the Apocalypse. The wisdom of their wit gets smuggled into the subconscious between the funny bits and the profound insights. Anyone who might--at some point in time--conceivably find themselves in a pitched struggle with either the dark, or not so dark, forces for the soul of humanity (and whales), should memorize this book before it's too late.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Family and I had a great time watching this film. Well worth the rental fee. Our 8 year old was on teh floor laughing
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book! Pam Grout is the absolute best and this book has truly changed my life. I recommend to everyone.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|This having ads thing is pretty upsetting considering it's being offered as an ad free app of the day! Remove the ads please they don't belong here
B002NN5F7A|1.0|Thought it was a very rough film.  Didn't care for it at all.  Without the &#34;F&#34; work, the film would've been much shorter!
1884883303|5.0|Wonderful reference guide just what I was looking for.  I use it all the time to find the value of certain guitars.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a great way to tie together all the books. I loved every single one of them and can't wait for the movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Ever since my daughter introduced me to Pinterest...I'm addicted to it!!! It's a great way to share ideas and inspirations, and make friends as well.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|The game took almost 40 minutes to load, but it was well worth the wait. At first you may be discouraged by the controls, but after some time playing the game you really get use to it. Furthermore, The LeBron Career and franchise mode part are a great addition to just Quickplay. In addition, music still plays while on the menu just like the console version. Finally, the graphics are stunning for a tablet and the rosters are up to date. And yes, LeBron is still basically unstoppable...
0805047905|2.0|This book is great but it's missing a page! After purple cat there should be a white dog but it's not there! It's terrible they are selling a book when they know it's missing a page. Save your money and buy elsewhere.
B00F9040HU|5.0|I have had this game on my computer. It's great and fairly easy to play. Kids and adults alike will enjoy!!
B007ZYDHRM|5.0|I have listened to dozens of audio cds, non fiction and fiction. This is the best. Sissy Spacek was born to do this. And of course the book is one of the great american novels. Not to be missed!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Steinbeck retells the story of Cain and Abel in the context of the mid-nineteenth century to WWII .  He creates complex human beings in a way that makes the book a meditation on human nature, good and evil, and free will.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I bought a copy of Argo , after seeing it at the theatre. Great movie!! I would definitely recommend buying a copy of this movie!!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this game!! Awesome game one of my fave Angry Birds games!!!! Can play it for hours!!!! Love going back and trying to bet my score!!!!
078884461X|4.0|lush colors are throughout the film and the voice overs are exceptionally well done very creative a great buy for anime lovers
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was really quite engaging and I am in the process of reading the rest of the series. It's not exactly a book you can tell mother about though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After hearing several people talk about how great this show is, I downloaded all three seasons and caught up.  Can't wait until Season 4!
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|I'll make this simple:<br /><br />I teach 11th Grade Shakespeare.<br /><br />Upon announcing we were watching this, my kids were fairly excited. We brought in popcorn, soda, etc.--made it a special movie day.<br /><br />Besides a slew of their gasps, and laughter--they were SILENT the whole time: enthralled, and captivated.<br /><br />We had such a great time, they were so appreciative of the interpretation, had so many opinions to voice, and finally understood Shakespeare.<br /><br />Five Stars!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|OMG this app stopped working please please update it I NEED THIS APP!!!! As soon as possible I can't talk to my friends anymore
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Good cd. Great voice for such a young performer. Very confident, strong voice. Hopefully not a 1 hit wonder. Hope she can repeat.
031250926X|4.0|My 9mo old son loves this book. The pages are big enough for him to help me turn the pages:).
B006HL9G10|5.0|I use it everyday for prayer and meditation...The gong sounds are awesome and very authentic as if you have one in the room with you.  I love the app and have passed this app to many of my friends.
B005ONTD42|5.0|I bought this Sphero shortly after the new model came out so I lucked out with the marked down price. The sphero is entertaining for anyone of any age. It's very easy to use once it's connected to your device and the fun lasts for hours! Can't wait to purchase the new model!
B00A285OOW|4.0|Henry Tudor is a fools child! He had no more right to the throne than any other man in the country. I wished that there were a better conclusion to this book. This book is not my least favorite of the cousins war series but most definitely not my favorite! Poor Princess Elizabeth! I wished she would have stood her ground as her mother and grandmother would have!  I'm so upset that I've finished the series... No what will I do? Lol
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|Love this new model!! Its a lot of fun to fool around with when you have some free time. My kids love playing with it and using my iPhone or tablet to roll the Sphero around the house. Keeps them entertained for hours! Great product!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|MUST READ!!! My heart ached for little Anne! God bless her life, she had little choices but was saved when all hope was gone just to be dropped again by her true love!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this because I always wanted a horse but couldn't have one so this app made me feel like I have a real horse thx for making it! :)
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I think this game is great for you to get. And it's free that means that you can get it! So go and get it now it's awesome.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|As always, Gladwell makes a number of interesting points in an accessible, highly readable way.  But more so than in his other books, the moral of many of the stories is being twisted to fit a central theory.<br /><br />The David and Goliath tale seems to be about breaking the rules. But Gladwell would have us believe it's actually about Goliath having too much of a good thing (size, armor, etc.).  That's necessary for the link with the second story, about the ideal number of students in a classroom (probably his best chapter).  The section on Martin Luther King skips over non-violent resistance to focus on creating photo-ready scenes for the press.  The Northern Ireland chapter spends more time on what the British did wrong than what the Protestant resistance did right, leaving the reader unclear what the moral is (find an arrogant opponent?).<br /><br />This book is remarkably repetitive, with many passages being reprised three or more times.  In one particularly annoying case the repeated passage is actually a lie, told to set up the grand reveal at the end of the chapter.  And that leads to my biggest disappointment with this book: it tries to manipulate the reader into seeing things into a particular way, rather than letting the stories speak for themselves.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Tipping Point\\", this book doesn't leave you thinking.  It's an enjoyable read, but easily forgotten.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|1 year old nephew loved it!  He played it over and over.  Lots of lights flashing and easy to manuever buttons.  He didn't pass stage 1, but I think you understand why.
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|This the third in the series was consistent with each of the previous releases. I liked the tie in to the moon landing giving it a touch of reality. Very complex CGI and incredible perspectives. I enjoyed it, but it's pretty much what I expected.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|A great book that does not take 10 years to get to the meat of the story. Had me hooked from chapter one.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This was Brad's big risk. A film that he produced in the Zombie genre. I loved how the zombies behaved in this move. It conveyed the pure insanity of being in a world surrounded by out of control zombies with one intention: turn you into one of them. The hyper tension of this world of Armageddon played out by airborne disease and the panic of what to do when all hell breaks loose and running at 50 mph is still not enough to survive. It was a great spectacle of horrific entertainment. Great job Brad Pitt!
B00BV1OT0O|3.0|I was not completely satisfied with this one because it came with a soft deformation. I'm sure it is a QC matter so not all of them has this defect.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|The movie takes place at the rundown Bagdad Café (and motel and gas station) in the middle of the Mojave Desert. When the movie started out, I did not like it at all. Nothing happened but an angry woman (the owner of the Café) yelling at her husband and everyone else. The movie did not seem to be going anywhere and I was ready to stop watching it. But then the woman from Germany shows up at the Bagdad Café (she had fought with her husband and left him in the middle of their trip across the U.S.) and the atmosphere slowly begins to change and pull you in. Before you know it, you are laughing and your heart is warming up. By the middle of this movie, you love it and all the wonderful characters you meet. Everyone in the movie changes and become one big family and all because of the woman from Germany. This is a warm, heartfelt movie. Watch it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Amazing little figure! Perfectly posable. Stand is a little rubbish though, might buy a better one to really let this collectable shine.
0345803485|3.0|I just finished the second volume of this trilogy. I also read many of the reviews... Some of the comments are spot on - the language is very simplistic, repetitive, at times childish and silly. Sometimes the author does use complex words (some of which had me consult a dictionary), but they frequently feel out of place, as if plucked out of a Thesaurus - just to create an illusion of the characters being sophisticated and educated.<br /><br />Love-making scenes are unrealistic, so are most of the characters, as they are practically flawless, even their flaws are flawless.<br /><br />Although I do agree with all of the above and critical comments, I have to admit that I have been enjoying the book and would like to finish its third volume. I think that most of the reviewers (myself including up to this line) have been taking this book too seriously. More over, if any of us have done meditation (if not, just try to sit for 5-10 minutes, doing \\"nothing\\" and just \\"watch\\" your thoughts), we may recognize that some of the paragraphs of this book resemble our \\"monkey minds\\". Our minds chatter endlessly, especially the minds of those in love...<br /><br />So, despite the fact that I began my review critically, I invite people just to watch their own minds, esp. in the presence of a love interest. Aren't we doing the same? We rejoice one minute and panic another; we are certain that we are loved, just to start doubting whether it is so after a misinterpreted glance. If looked from that perspective, the book actually may even be considered quite realistic.<br /><br />Watch and hear two lovers cooing and bickering - frequently those are silly words, nothing too grandiose. And the book kind of describes that too.<br /><br />I did enjoy some of the humor, some of the psychological contemplations and explanations. I also do believe that many people successful and fearless in business are terrified and insecure in personal relationships. So, is the main character. I also do believe that sometimes a person crosses our path and becomes our greatest teacher who leads us to the next step in our personal evolution, when we can shed what we don't need anymore and step into another phase of our lives.<br /><br />So, if you just want some light entertainment/fantasy and you're capable of not taking it too seriously, then do read this book - and you might find it enjoyable and entertaining.ve that sometimes a person crosses our path and becomes our greatest teacher who leads us to the next step in our personal evolution, when we can shed what we don't need anymore and step into another phase of our lives.<br /><br />So, if you just want some light entertainment/fantasy and you're capable of not taking it too seriously, then do read this book - and you might find it enjoyable and entertaining.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|This movie is worth seeing. Many reviewers have done an in depth analysis of the film, so I'll keep mine brief.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?<br /><br />Weakness: Scripting. Plain and simply, I believe that the scripting is the sole reason why the film got panned by critics. The characters are very easy to read and will say exactly what they should say when they should say it. This was a huge weakness and left me curious about why Disney didn't vet this a little better. IMO If the scripting was fixed up and the characters were a bit more.. unique.. it would have made this a 5 star blockbuster. As is, this is pretty much my only complaint about the film.<br /><br />Acting:<br />The acting is well done. The characters interact well and they are very in the moment. However, the script that they seemed to follow to a T is once more the weakness.<br /><br />Filming: It's beautifully filmed. This is definitely some eye candy. I have not yet seen it in 3D, but the 2D version was good enough that I would bet that the 3D version is awesome.<br /><br />Plot: The plot was great. I have watched this film a number of times and enjoyed it during each sitting. I'm happy to say that this did not have the same issues as the scripting.<br /><br />Summary: It's definitely worth a watch. Hopefully Disney sees how well this film is doing on Amazon and decides to create the sequel that we all want to see; albeit with a new team working on the script.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|This is a very creative and entertaining series.  Torchwood is a unique series; while most television is simply mindless escape the creative plot lines used on this series continues to surprise.  I find I sometimes dream about some of the wild ideas they dream up . . . I can't say I can recall any other T.V. series I dream about save one . . . Dr. Who.  If you like Dr. Who you will probably enjoy Torchwood.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Great action. Like all the actors. Need more Jet Li. Can't wait for the next one. They keep getting better.

B00EO10M54|3.0|I hesitate to write a review based around Amazon purchasing guidance as opposed to musical content.  But this needs to be disclosed.  If you are on the [[ASIN:B00FHAB3HW Bangerz (Deluxe Version) [Explicit]]] page for the MP3 download of the explicit deluxe version, you will see a \\"Buy CD and Get AutoRip\\" button right below the Add to Cart button.  And the physical version is cheaper so why not?  Watch out!  That Buy CD button leads to this product: [[ASIN:B00EO10M54 Bangerz (Deluxe Version)]].  This is the censored version and you will get the censored version for the AutoRip if you buy it.

B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This app looks like it was thrown together for three purposes.  They are to get you to pay for a useless app, find out information about you and your location and try to sell you more apps from the developer.  The app is blah in design and doesn't even include a radar map or warnings of pending bad weather.  Do not waste your money on the useless app.  There are many free ones available that are much better and they don't use Flurry Analytics which is using your data.<br /><br />This app will not even come on with your device's location services disabled.  It is more interested in learning the fine details of the GPS to determine where you are.  If it eventually can't find your location it will ask you to enter you location manually. Once it was activated I found the app basically useless. You get the temperature outside. Another screen will tell you the temperature projected by the hour for the day.  You then can swipe and see the max temperature for the next 5 days.<br /><br />Don't waste $1.99 on this useless app which is an advertisement.

B00B8R1NP0|4.0|Fantastic read; I couldn't put it down. A satisfying final twist provides gratification delightfully delayed by a series of apparently patternless murders. Ultimately we have the 'perp's disturbing rationale. I will definitely look for more from this author.

B0050XFYNA|5.0|Exquisitely beautiful in every way! Perfection! The actors,both the youngest and the young men, bring to life a love evolving into the one kind of love so few ever experience. Their anguish at the coming separation is palpable; your heart breaks for them. The dream sequence in Argentina is beautiful. Francisco's pain of sacrifice for Thomas' success will make you cry. Real, deep, love is never wrong when one soul is incomplete without the other. In the mathematics of young Thomas', 1+1=1
B00BGI08GG|4.0|With the second season hitting TV screens, now is the perfect time to catch up with \\"Arrow: The Complete First Season.\\" All 23 episodes and some nice special features are included in this collection. Following up in the footsteps of \\"Smallville,\\" this introduces viewers to another DC character. However, Green Arrow has a much darker outlook on crime fighting and a shadier past than the Man of Steel.<br /><br />Arrogant billionaire playboy Oliver Queen accompanies his father on a boating trip aboard their luxury yacht. After the ship sinks and everyone on board dies, he's left to fend for himself for five years on a remote island. While there, he encounters a deadly band of mercenaries setting up for an attack. He partners up with another castaway who teaches him the art of war with a bow and arrow. Upon his rescue, Oliver returns to his home with a renewed passion in life. He will rid the city of its criminal elements using his newfound skills as a vigilante archer.<br /><br />If you're expecting \\"Smallville\\" going into \\"Arrow,\\" you need to get that out of your head right now. It's much darker and rooted in realism. Where Clark Kent had issues with offing villains, Green Arrow doesn't think twice. He's closer to Batman than Superman in attitude, although the Dark Knight doesn't believe in killing either. That's probably why they decided to re-cast the lead character and steer as far away from the Oliver Queen and hero we saw in the sci-fi and fantasy-heavy \\"Smallville.\\"<br /><br />You won't find any meteor freaks or meta-humans in \\"Arrow,\\" either. The villains and other heroes Arrow runs into are all rooted in reality. Think Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" Trilogy versus Zack Snyder's \\"Man of Steel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\" takes some time building up, but the wait pays off. It's a slow-burning drama with characters the writers flesh out enough that you actually care about them. Some of those characters will be familiar to viewers who follow the comic book. We get appearances by the Huntress, Deadshot, Deathstroke, Roy rperH<br /><br />Harper and Laurel Lance. To comic book geeks, it's common knowledge that Harper becomes Speedy/Red Arrow/Arsenal and Lance takes on the alter ego known as Black Canary. It's treats like these that give hardcore fans a lot to smile about.<br /><br />\\"Arrow: The Complete First Season\\" is not rated. I would give it a PG-13 rating because of adult situations, violence, and language. It's a prime-time TV show on a major network, but it still dives into a some mature content children don't need to see.<br />The show is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Dolby Digital. The picture is clean and crisp, even though much of it is blanketed in darkness. The surround sound brings the streets of Starling City and the jungles of the island to vivid life.<br /><br />There are some exciting special features included for \\"Arrow: The Complete First Season.\\" Three featurettes explore what happens behind-the-scenes of the show. They're entitled \\"'Arrow' Comes Alive!,\\" \\"'Arrow:' Fight School/Stunt School,\\" and \\"'Arrow:' Cast and Creative Team at the 2013 Paleyfest.\\" It also contains unaired scenes and a gag reel.<br /><br />\\"Arrow: The Complete First Season\\" isn't only for comic book fans. The writers for the show do a great job establishing characters and a universe that anyone can enjoy. It's a slow-burning drama with enough action, mystery, and suspense to keep audiences coming back for more. Although it gets off to a slow start because of character development, \\"Arrow\\" successfully picks up and ultimately pays off with a great second and third act.appearances by the Huntress, Deadshot, Deathstroke, Roy rperH<br /><br />Harper and Laurel Lance.

The surround sound brings the streets of Starling City and the jungles of the island to vivid life.<br /><br />There are some exciting special features included for \\"Arrow: The Complete First Season.\\" Three featurettes explore what happens behind-the-scenes of the show. They're entitled \\"'Arrow' Comes Alive!,\\" \\"'Arrow:' Fight School/Stunt School,\\" and \\"'Arrow:' Cast and Creative Team at the 2013 Paleyfest.\\" It also contains unaired scenes and a gag reel.<br /><br />\\"Arrow: The Complete First Season\\" isn't only for comic book fans. The writers for the show do a great job establishing characters and a universe that anyone can enjoy. It's a slow-burning drama with enough action, mystery, and suspense to keep audiences coming back for more. Although it gets off to a slow start because of character development, \\"Arrow\\" successfully picks up and ultimately pays off with a great second and third act.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Everything about NCIS is top notch. The story lines and character development make it one of the all time greats!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read this book when I was in 5th grade, I am not 23 years old and enjoyed it so much more. There is so much meaning and a connection that can be felt by anyone who reads it. It is relatable and well written, everyone should be required to read this book.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I've seen the movie many times, but never read the book. I was sure missing out! The book differs from the movie, yet not in a way that totally changes the story. Honestly, I like the book a little more. The end of the movie was very hard to grasp, but it makes perfect sense in the book. Glad I read it!
B006O7XOOW|5.0|I bought this toy for my 10 month old son and we love it. The music is different than the average toy, its more upbeat rather than the alphabet song or something more common. Yes, the assembly is a pain when you're putting the screws in but hey it's only five minutes out of your day to screw them in.<br />Right now my son shows slightly more interest in just the balls themselves but hes only 10 months, he can grow with the toy and learn how to use it as he gets older. The price on amazon is so much better than what I paid here, I wish i would have looked here first before jumping the gun and purchasing it out of excitement. But all in all i think its very worth it.
B008602KQI|5.0|My son read all the books in the series, but I never thought the movie would be good.  Well it was and I would totally recommend this to anyone.  Its not just for teens like I had previously thought.  Looks like I'll be buying the books just to know what happens next.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Flimsy plot, terrible writing, and bad acting (except for Morgan Freeman, who must have been tricked into this one). Save your time and your money!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was searching for this product because I own an Xbox and wanted to watch Netflix and youtube on my TV. However, It's a pain to have to pay for monthly XBox Gold Membership to use these apps on XBox server. This product is relatively cheap compared to Apple TV and other Microsoft devices that costs $99.00 not including cables and HDMI connector. The package arrived on time, the box was tiny and had everything that I would need to connect it to my TV, including the Chromecast itself, a charger (if your TV doesn't have a USB outlet) to charge the Chromecast, an HDMI cable (this supposingly boost your wifi reception and in case the Chromecast did not fit directly in your TV). Set up was very easy. I plug the devices in, turn on my laptop and download the Chromecast app. Install and set up took about 10 mins total. If you want to control Chromecast on your phone on Netflix and Youtube, there's an icon to press and it shows option to watch on your iphone or stream on TV. Super easy to use and navigate. Did exaclty what I bought it for: streaming my Netflix shows on TV. Only draw-back is on Netflix, you have to manually start a new episode, it doesn't automatically starts like on your laptop. Overall, I love it.
B00AO686MY|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie for sooo long. I can't say any negative thing about this movie. If you loved the original or if you just love animation then go and buy this now.
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|If you are a fan of author Peter John [[ASIN:1481879103 Dead Medium]] then you will certainly enjoy his latest offering, The Rekindled Affair, about a couple who reunite after 45 years! It's well written and quietly moving. A nice quick read.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Shahrukh really outdoes himself in this one - he shows suuch control and ability to empathize with his character - an amazing story and message for everyone. Don't miss this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked this book but it was kind of predictable.  However, it held my interest and I felt as if I knew the people I was reading about on a personal basis.  Great writing.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Like almost anyone who went to high school in the US for the last forever, you know about the Great Gatsby because you probably had to write a book report on it, but ask most people what happens in the book and 80% of people will have some fuzzy idea, but not really have much to say.<br /><br />The story by F. Scott Fitzgerald is really compelling and this version of the movie does a good job of connecting you to the characters. It uses some flashy techniques to make it more accessible to people expecting action / flashy things, and JayZ soundtrack, which will make some people like the movie and some people think less of it, but overall, I really enjoyed it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|In looking at available alarm clock apps you will find hundreds. I have tried several of them but this one is the best by far.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I just got it. it looks so fun because you can put you stuff in one folder and so it is really really cool
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Never really new the correct battery life of my kindle but now I do.let's you know where your battery drain is going
B005WUHAX8|5.0|At first I was skeptical about ordering because of all the other reviews, but this is the real deal! It was delivered fast and in unopened retail packaging. I love it would totally recommend ordering this product!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I'm usually one to give a book the benefit of the doubt when it starts out slow, especially when it comes with high recommendations. In the case of Wool, I'm a little disappointed. Without giving away any spoilers, so far I haven't felt connected with the characters. There's potential for it, but I feel the author falls short when he could have worked on character development just a bit more. If one of them were to die, my response would be, &#34;oh well I guess.&#34; Whereas other novels - Game of Thrones, Harry Potter - suck the reader into the lives of its characters then shamelessly wipe them off the page.<br /><br />I truly hope the Silo Saga redeems itself here in the second half, but I'm not terribly hopeful at this point.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Searching for texts is so easy and reminders are great!  So quick to navigate and variations of versions is ideal.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I got this for my 3 years old daughter.  She loves it.  She watches this at least once every week.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I love this movie. I have read the book and could not wait to see the movie. It makes you think differently about things and let's everyone know they are not alone in tough times.
B003YUSBRW|2.0|I liked the price, lightness, and fashion of these slip-ons. However, I wore them two days and the back of the shoe near my heels rubbed so much as to bring up blisters. I had to put band-aids on both heels to continue wearing them but thought, &#34;This is no way to have to wear shoes!&#34;, so I returned them. There should be some kind of cushioning in the back but alas, there is only the bare canvas stitched together...and that is the problem.
B000J6I0U2|5.0|I have always loved this movie.<br /><br />It has so many things going for it. Heath Ledger, half the cast of Stardust, NATALIE DORMER (though Heath Ledger is by far way more awesome than the rest of the cast... and not just because he's dead now).<br /><br />Its very funny, and definitely a feel good movie.<br /><br />The blu-ray disc worked flawlessly!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. I love that the crops don't whither so it's easy to come leave for a couple days
B0063IH60K|4.0|I won the first game right off played 3 more games and didn't win. Better luck to you.<br />Downloaded fine
B005HSL626|4.0|Colorful active fun but an ad after every round. That gets old after a while. Too bad as that kind of recks your rythm as you try to beat your last score. Works well on KindleFire.
B005J4TLN4|1.0|I still have not seen this movie as the disc would not play on an device.  A great addition to my local landfill. =(
6305144176|5.0|I just love Robin Williams as an actor.  He has a great way of keeping tough situations in a lite manner so that one could be easily open to suggested solutions.  He laughter is so refreshing.  This was one of his better films in my opinion.  He showed all sides of military politics and the frustrations with in.  It showed that sometimes you do make a difference and sometimes the solution is just not visible.  You will enjoy this film
B009X01D9U|5.0|This case is great! my sister has one for her Kindle Fire HD 7.0 and she loves it and I was so happy to see that they had them back in stoke and big enough to fit the Kindle Fire HD 8.9, and in Orange which is my favorite color! Very happy with this case, it sets up great for watching movies and is very protective in case the kindle gets dropped. Belive me my sister has 5 kids and hers still works great...lol
B008AX1HD8|2.0|This is my first Hole novel and I wonder, having read so many rave reviews, if it was a mistake to try the first book first. I am having a very hard time finishing it. I find it tedious and plodding. Reading the reviews I wonder if I'm reading the same book that other reviewers have read. I don't yet feel much sympathy for the Harry character. I found Andrew the Aborigine interesting but now I'm at 83% finished (reading on my Kindle) or chapter 48. I actually came back to the review for inspiration to finish it. Perhaps I am being unfair by rating it before finishing but I wonder if other reviewers who have read other books may be rating it based on the other (better written?) books in the series and wanting to know how it all started and not on this one as a work in itself. I really want to feel what other reviewers have felt, so I'm going to press on and try to finish and will change this review if I change my mind when I eventually finish. At this time, I find the book disappointing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Characters are amazing. Dialogue between Harvey and Mike is always amusing.<br />This show has excitement and suspense in every episode, as it's never a dull moment.
0812983459|2.0|I started reading this book with great enthusiasm after reading so many rave reviews. Some interesting ideas but I found the writing and the characters flat. It's an easy read but I prefer books that challenge me more by taking me on a deeper journey. This is not a book I will be keeping.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I give it 5 stars as it just plugs in and takes you the steps to installed in less than 5 minutes. Works with any phone and on multiple devices. I highly recommend it if you are a Netflix user.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It left me wanting more....so I came back and bought the next one! And then the next! I'm now waiting on the next one.....
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great story, wonderful 3-D effects.  I will watch this movie over and over because I believe I'll see something new each time.  One is never sure of the truth at the end of the story.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It left me wanting more....so I came back and bought the next one! And then the next! I'm now waiting on the next one.....
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|if you loved the last Trek, you will love this one, just not as much. The last was a complete reboot of the story, a complete new beginning. This is a continuation. I have watched this movie twice, but before the night is over I will have watched it thrice. If you new me you would understand what that means. If you like sci-fi, give it a shot.
B00846REIS|4.0|It left me wanting more....so I came back and bought the next one! And then the next! I'm now waiting on the next one.....
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|The title of the review and the number of stars the books get might appear incongruous, but the book is certainly underwhelming for a Stephen King novel.<br /><br />In this book, we meet Daniel Torrance, the kid from The Shining, who has grown up and has alcohol-fuelled demons of his own to exorcise. The middle-aged Dan, wants to stay as far away from the shining as possible, and hence turns to drink to drown his 'abilities'.<br /><br />But how long can he do that, when Abra Stone, a kid with shining far more powerful, needs his help? Read further to see how Dan and Abra line up against the True Knot, vampirical creatures, travelling across the land as harmless oldies in RVs, who live off the 'steam' produced by torturing children who possess the shining.<br /><br />I thought the book started quite positively, with a teenaged Dan, but fizzled out somewhere in the middle. The True Knot are nowhere as menacing as some of the monsters that King has conjured up over the years. And somewhere, I feel the editor hasn't done a great job. I think being too specific about Abra using her 'iPhone' instead of her phone is just daft! Also, there were pop culture references to Daenerys from Game of Thrones and a 'peanut farmer in the White House', which were wholly unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall, the True Knot are the lamest bunch of 'dark creatures' ever created and some portions of the book involving them are plain hammy. However, the book still gets 4 stars because there are glimpses of King's mastery of the written word - only in brief flashes, though.<br /><br />The book could've got 5 stars as well - if it hadn't run out of 'steam', you know!<br /><br />P.S. The Shining will still remain King's Number One book, as far as I'm concerned.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I'm not much for historical books, but I've read a few other Philippa Gregory books, so when this was offered as a Kindle deal, I bought it.  Very glad I did--an area of time I'm not all that familiar with, and the politics were intriguing.  As usual, a deft hand at mixing historical facts with a fictional story.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Part two of the Showtime series. This is a bit of true history well played out by an outstanding cast. The Borgia Pope was a crook and quite successful at it and this Showtime series is a tell all. The Popes son Cesare is hot hot hot and alone is worth watching the series for!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So disappointed.  Story was supposed to end with this book.  It didn't.  There was almost no plot advancement, and felt like it ignored character development from prior 2 books.  Really feel cheated by this.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|This game will take a bit of patients to get used to and getting it right, but once you do, it is a lot of fun. This is not for any small screen phones or tablets so you need at least the 8.5 screen and make sure you calibrate it before playing or you can forget it. I like this game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|That this book will make you cry probably isn't much of a surprise.  I'm an adult, but purchased because had seen so much great press about it, and couldn't beat the Kindle price.  Glad I did--thought it was fantastic.  Character development was great, plot was believable, it was sad while being realistic and not overly maudlin.  Worth reading.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works as advertised.<br />Never gives me trouble runs fine on phone and kindle.<br />Highly recommend this app to anyone that uses eBay.<br />Paired with a bid snippet I never loose an auction.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I've been waiting to for this to be released from the vault every since my daughter was born 4 years ago--it lived up to my expectations and memory.  Colors are vivid, story is terrific.  There is a new favorite princess in our house for sure!  Was fun to watch too having just been on the new Little Mermaid ride at Disney World : )
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|I would just rent this movie.  Do not buy because it is not a MUST SEE movie.  I could have passed seeing it and not missed anything but it is OK!
B005XLN97M|4.0|I wanted a Barbie house to accomodate our growing collection, but not something that'd take up a large chunk of the playroom.  So happy I found this one!  It's got everything my 4 year old wants--living room, kitchen, bathroom and bedroom, but is nice and compact.  She can easily fit 3 Barbies in it to play.  It comes with a suprising amount of (tiny!) accessories.  Our Barbies have had drinks in their hands (juice, of course!) ever since this arrived!  Very happy with the purchase.  It did take some time to put together though, so consider doing so before giving it as a gift.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|We all know how great this album is. The download was spectacular, and have been enjoyong it many times over
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I don't know if it is my life experiences or what that got me to enjoy this movie. I enjoyed it. It is a duel story of two similar lives..Mud and Ellis. They are different stages but experiencing similar trials. The real morale of the story is being strong within yourself and recognizing when someone is not worth your effort and it is time to move on. Initially I thought \\"here we go, a depressing struggle\\" but it turned out to have some really good high notes. I think the young Ellis did a great acting job in this role. Some may knock the movie and it's profanity but it does fit the characters in relation to their lives. I would recommend watching!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This download came in clear and flawless. It's nice to have some music in my collection that is this enjoyable
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|The game has great graphics and a good storyline. There are a couple of spots where the hint button comes in handy.  All in all its well worth the money.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is a well crafted movie from Hayao Miyazaki, and came in perfect condition. I'm finding the need to get his complete ovure
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like the game wish I could get it on my laptop. The design of the areas are really cool. Long game don't yt? Bored with it
B000059MEK|5.0|The masters of mix have struck gold on this early release, and brings back the charge I got when it first came out years ago
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Honestly one of my favorite albums in recent memory. The music feels evokes some incredible emotions, and perfectly combines modern electronic effects with acoustic guitars and cellos. The use of intros and interludes really makes it a perfect album to stay in with on a Saturday night. Part folk, part alt, part shoegaze, I loved every minute of it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The running, jumping, sliding, bashing and rocket launching features of this game make it action packed fun! It is my turn to game when I am bored.
B000IYU9IG|1.0|There is nothing I can say about this product besides it never worked at all. Too much trouble to try to return it!
159514188X|5.0|This is such an awesome book. It sounded great to me from the beginning, but I didn't realize how much I would enjoy it. The author makes it all seem so real, and by the end there are so many questions to ask yourself. What could all those people have done different? It's kind of sad that she's sort of blaming all those people, but the main message of the novel is every little thing you do counts. This is very accurate when it comes to suicide, and there's so much more that can be done to prevent it. You can tell that the author did his research. It's was so well-written. I'm happy to add it to my book collection.
B003L77GGU|5.0|great show, got all caught up to season 8 now. going to see if i can get my mom hooked on it now.
B003VANOFY|4.0|It feels vey nice, the sound is like 7.1 surround system<br /><br />but you should notice that it works only with PC, and wearing it for long can make your ears heart
B00FN811SY|5.0|I installed on smartphone awesome!  However, cannot install on my Trio Stealth tablet! Not compatible.  PLEASE PLEASE fix the problem.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What might have been seems to be the theme of this well written book.  The characters are both strong yet weak in some ways.  I identified with all of the main characters as we all have some of the characteristics they exhibit.  l loved the book and the way it proceeded to unwind.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins is the author of an action, and at times violent and gruesome book, the Hunger Games. Ms. Collins writes a truly exceptional book, filled with fear, heroism, trust and a very very good story. Set in the future after a devastated war. The capital stages the hunger games to keep the outlying areas in line, 24 participants all children of varying ages, participate in trying to survive while the other 23 are killed by other participants. This is something they have to do or their villages will face sever punishment Katniss Everdeen picked from district 12 is a very powerful character in this story. This story has a very good message about friendship, trust, love?, strength, and determination. I also loved the movie, Jennifer Lawrence is excellent in the lead role, no one could have done a better job, she was made for this role.
0670026638|3.0|The good and the not-so-good: I practice zen for some years now and it was delightful to read fiction that concerned zen/time-being/Dogen's writing. I realize that putting zen ideas into a novel would be difficult, but enjoyed the effort just the same. And I loved the ending and the mystery of it; all the parts came together. I gave it a 3-star because the book felt choppy and too long, particularly about the bullying sections--just too much and not necessary to get the point across. The first third felt too long for that reason.  And unlike other readers, I really liked Ruth's character in that she seemed to \\"ground\\" the story of Nao, whose life was very dramatic. I loved the interwoven aspects of Ruth and Nao and the diaries. I especially liked the characters of Nao's father Haruki #2, and great grandmother Jiko (and Haruki #1 who was an offshoot of Jiko's energy and teachings) who were the only characters I \\"cared\\" for. I did not care for the very violent images of the Kamakaze warrior trainings, which are now stuck in my head, but it was a good lesson in history. I liked learning about modern Japanese culture from a teen point of view and the narrative was excellent, the plot tied together. I guess, the overall story was interesting enough but does not \\"hold\\" me like it did for other readers.
0345803450|5.0|Someone on her observed - not exactly a spy thriller. Of course not, the organization she works for is MI5, not MI6. So it involves domestic intelligence work. In a nice plot twist, a character who is *not* in intelligence work at all ends up doing some of the most expert spying - against the heroine of the book. That leads to one of the cleverest ends of a novel I have read in recent years. I thought this was a great read.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My kids love this. Fun watching all the fish with Disney characters thrown in. Probably won't keep their attention for longer than a week but cute for what it is...
B008Y212PI|3.0|I fell in love with this game. I love brain teasers, and games that require thought, rather than just tap, tap, tap. Even though I have registered, it continues to reset itself back to Default. So being in the 15x15s mean nothing.
006112429X|5.0|Brilliant story. The characters and nuance are intense. If you've been affronted with the hostility, manipulation, and surreal lack of empathy sociopaths have, you'll have your feelings and senses put into words well - even the confusion and messy conflicts within yourself and the opinions of others that are experienced. If you haven't known any of this directly, it's a tangible glimpse.
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|This is an OK game. Since it was free - that kind of makes it a very good game. It isn't really that challenging, but it will pass the time.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Amezing movie and is a plus in Blu ray also the story is great I never been fan of the cartoon but when I saw the movie I was blown away
B00CSYR432|5.0|My granddaughter loved it..They wished it was longer..The special effects are always wonderful with this company.. I wish they would make more..
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|Again Amezing movie and is a plus in 3D Blu ray also the story is great I never been fan of the cartoon but when I saw the movie I was blown away
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this move, it exceeded my expectations.  I have recomended it to all of my friends to watch.
B0009K7RES|5.0|It was easy, fast and priced right. I couldn't be happier. Came with a download too. Four more words required.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Great graphics. Really fun to play. Not too difficult. I could play without getting stumped. The mini games are great too. I love the games from G5.
0142420891|5.0|The sequel to a magnificent book!!  So fantastic to continue the story behind another's eyes.<br />Loved all her books!  Make it a mission to read all of her work!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I like the story and the characters are credible. The blood and gore is pretty well done. It's easy to get drawn into the story because of the much better than average writing, directing and production. The characters have depth and personality.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I've just recently started strategy games and this one was awesome, though I wish it were a little longer.  I also love the idea of being able to select the skill level you want to play at.  Awesome job!  As a beginner I'll defiantly be buying more of the G5 games.  Both beginners and experts will like this game. Be careful of young children playing or watching mom or dad play.  A couple times a bad guy popping out made my daughter and I both jump
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an absolutely AMAZING book. I think I might have liked it more than the hunger games. It deals more with emotions than sci-fi, making it seem more realistic to me. AMAZING is all I can even say right now..
B007XC9BSK|4.0|My 3 year old son loved this toy at first sight.  He loved the way the trailer shoots micro cars from the back and how the clear side diaays the cars.<br /><br />Overall would recommend his item.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Great story<br /><br />I loved the book because it was about French girls<br />That had lost their homes and parents too
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Just when you think AB peaked with AB III, they release this masterpiece called \\"Fortress.\\" Wow! I am a huge fan of Mark Tremonti, so I follow his work wherever he goes. Therefore I am also a big Creed fan, as well as a fan of Mark's solo album. His guitar work, in my humble opinion, sets the bar for every other guitarist in the market. Fortress is no exception. With this album, it is obvious that Mark pushed his talents further than ever before. I won't call out all of his solos in my track reviews below, but they are all expectedly outstanding. Aside from MT, this band as a whole does not disappoint with this album. Both Myles' vocals and his guitar work are amazing. Flip's drumming is second to none. And if ever I started my own band, I would want Brian on bass guitar. I won't review every track, but wanted to hit my favorites.<br /><br />Cry of Achilles: What a great choice to begin this album. As other reviewers have mentioned, the intro is unique and just draws you right into the album. The rest of the track I would also call somewhat unique to the AB sound we're used to. Then again, many of the tracks on this album seem to follow in that vein. Overall, on the awesome scale, I would rate this track as awesome!<br /><br />Addicted to Pain: Got the single when it first came out and played it to death. Yet it has not gotten old for me. What a great classic AB sounding track. Love it!<br /><br />Bleed It Dry: This one will blow your face off if you're not careful. Love the build up to the chorus, not to mention the chorus itself. Myles does nice work with his vocals matching the powerful driving force of this song. Probably one of my top 3 favorites on the album.<br /><br />Calm the Fire: In my humble opinion, this is THE best track on the album. It starts off with a \\"calm\\", beautifully done intro. Not sure who is doing the exceptional guitar work here, but Myles naturally does not disappoint with the vocals. As the intro fades into silence, the track picks up andcontinues throughout with Tremonti's guitar work doing just as much driving as Flip's drumming. Be prepared to have your mind blown right out of your head and all over the wall as this track gets going. The melodic runs that Tremonti weaves into the main theme of the track are nothing short of incredible and genius. I could listen to this track all day long and never tire of it. A+!<br /><br />Waters Rising: I actually was expecting at least one whole track to feature Tremonti as lead vocal. This track did not disappoint. After Tremonti's solo album, my appetite was wet to hear more from him vocally. It was a nice change 2/3 of the way through the album to hear Myles singing backup, which he also is outstanding at. Great track and perfect choice to feature Tremonti vocally!<br /><br />Fortress: The perfect title track! I had to chuckle when at various points in the song, I expected it to wrap up, but it didn't. The track keeps going for 7+ minutes, breaking the mold for modern rock music and harking back to many of the classics. This is certainly not a bad thing, rather, I found myself looking forward to each minute after the 4 minute mark to hear what they were going to do next. The melody and the riffs are certainly unique and definitely AB sounding. I loved every minute of it and found myself feeling sad when it was over! Very nicely done and a great finish for the standard cut album.<br /><br />Outright (bonus): Having purchased the physical disc from Best Buy, I received the album containing this exclusive bonus track. Let me just say this is an excellent track and could have easily been included in the main set, quality-wise. After hearing it, I guess I can understand why it was probably cut from the main set. It does have a distinctly brighter/happier tone than the rest of the album. However, I really enjoy brighter sounding rock when it is well done, as this one is. Once again, Myles' range is incredible. Tremonti's runs and riffs with the lower notes are just brilliant. It takes much talent to pull off these lower riffs and still get them to stand out from the driving drum and bass line. Just a freeking awesome track in my opinion. I'm sorry for those who have not had a chance to listen to this one yet, because I would probably put it in my top 3 tracks on the album!<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If you like rock and roll, buy this album. There is no other option. Enjoy!

B008AK8FHM|3.0|A reader partial to the historical classification of books (though one who is not too fussy-minded) might feel tempted to add Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander to the thousand-year accumulation of vision literature. Though recorded by members of the literate clergy, these visions were related by laymen who professed, without any obvious ulterior motive, to have died and returned to life with an eye-witness description of heaven and hell. But it is what sets Proof of Heaven apart from this tradition that makes it initially so interesting and ultimately so problematic. The visions recorded by Pope Gregory the Great in 590, for example, were experienced in an age in which people were educated to believe in visions, an age of fasting, flagellation and fever, in which sanitation was poor and antibiotics were yet to be discovered. And, not surprisingly, the visions bear all the hallmarks of an intense religiosity and credulity.  Eben Alexander, on the other hand, a neurosurgeon, scientist, and former atheist, presents himself to his readers as the most unlikely candidate imaginable for such an experience and would have us believe that this lends enormous credence to his claims.<br /><br />What happened to him can be summarized in a single paragraph. In 2008, Eben Alexander contracted bacterial meningitis and fell into a coma that lasted for seven days. During that time, he says, he left his body and entered a spiritual dimension that consisted of three levels: an earthen, subterranean cavern whose walls were a bubbling, protean mass from which ugly faces appeared and disappeared; above that, a glittering iridescent dreamscape, viewed from a vantage point that he starts by describing as a bolus of innumerable butterflies and later simply as an enormous butterfly wing, on which he stood in the company of an angelic female presence; and, finally, a black hole at the center of which was an infinite intelligence that appeared to him as an orb of glittering darkness and to which, throughout his account, refers to as The Om.<br /><br />According to Alexander, two important features of his experience suffice to demonstrate that it was neither a dream nor a hallucination. The first is completely subjective and therefore completely unfalsifiable: the vividity of the spiritual world which, he emphasizes repeatedly, was \\"more real than real\\" and in contrast to which his conscious experience is but a confused and fragmentary dream. The second (something which in theory could but has not yet been satisfactorily proven) is that during his vision his neocortex was not functioning and the experience must therefore be imputed to spiritual, or supraneural, consciousness.<br /><br />No one, least of all Eben Alexander, should be surprised that his book has elicited criticism, incredulity, and even scorn. There have also been accusations of factual inaccuracy and even willful falsehood.  Dr. Laura Potter, for example, one of the doctors who treated Alexander, has refuted his claim that his last words before slipping into coma were, \\"God, help me!\\" and supports this refutation with the rather robust counterargument that he was by that point intubated and incapable of speech. She also denies that his coma was the result of his meningitis, with the loss of higher brain activity, and states that it was medically induced and the patient conscious throughout--an assertion which, if true, would utterly destroy Alexander's credibility but which directly contradicts the written testimony of another doctor who treated him, Dr. Scott Wade, found in the appendix of the book.<br /><br />Others, while accepting the medical circumstances, have called both his assumptions and his conclusions into question. Fellow neuroscientist Sam Harris makes the rather uncontroversial point that, \\"even in cases where the brain is alleged to have shut down, its activity must return if the subject is to survive and describe the experience\\" and then observes that there is simply no wayto establish that Alexander's vision occurred while his neocortex was not functioning. Oliver Sacks, agreeing with Harris, suggests that Alexander's vision probably occurred as he was surfacing from the coma and his cortex was returning to full function. The vision, according to this explanation, only seemed to last seven days but was in fact condensed into the indeterminate period of time before Alexander reopened his eyes but after his brain activity had resumed. His error, they suggest, consists in fitting to the duration of his coma an experience that in fact occurred in its immediate aftermath.<br /><br />William Hazlitt noted, judiciously, that an author may be wrong in his main argument and yet deliver fifty truths in arriving at a false conclusion. Having read Proof of Heaven, together with the criticism of it I have outlined above, I find myself equally and rather inconveniently sympathetic to both Alexander and his critics. There is no question that the explanation provided by Harris and Sacks is infinitely more probable than that provided by Alexander. And to their general skepticism, several specific corroborating details could be added. Despite claiming that prior to his coma he was a hardboiled atheist and scientist with a materialistic worldview, for instance, Alexander reveals much that could have primed him for his vision: Specifically, his long exposure to religious and parapsychological influences in the form of two family friends; one, the minister of an Episcopal church of which he was a member; the other, an \\"intuitive\\" and author of a book on channeling (The Third Eye) of which his wife is an enthusiastic and accommodating reader. And yet in this midst of all this, and during a vision which, with its butterfly wings and attractive female angels, makes Alexander an easy mark for skeptical derision, he has either intuited or invented several ideas which, at the very least, make interesting contributions to speculative ontology while also presenting a theory which, if it does not explain reality, has the virtue of explaining itself.<br /><br />One problem encountered when pondering the possibility that consciousness might exist independently of the body is the difficulty of explaining the purpose of the brain and its staggering neuronal complexity. Relieved of the task of generating consciousness, the human brain becomes an absurd superfluity, a useless and uselessly complex excrescence. To this question Alexander is able to postulate an answer: The brain itself does not produce consciousness; per contra, it is \\"a kind of reducing valve or filter, shifting the larger, nonphysical consciousness that we posses in the nonphysical worlds down into a more limited capacity for the duration of our mortal lives.\\"<br /><br />A second problem follows from the suggestion, made by Alexander, that human love and consciousness (and not, say, the atom or dark energy) is the primary element of our universe. For this implies an anthropocentric model of cosmology that entails the necessity of either explaining or ignoring the supermassive vastitude of space and our planet's relatively tiny size. If human consciousness is central to the universe, why is it supported by such an infinitesimally minute point of such a wastefully gargantuan substrate? Alexander's answer is that space is an illusion projected onto the universe by the human brain. In higher states of conscious, all of space is revealed to occupy a single point--much as a two-dimensional being would see from a three-dimensional perspective that his two-dimensional universe, with its parallactic shifts and vanishing points, occupied a single plane.<br /><br />Lastly, though somewhat supplementarily, one might mention the Borgesian charm of his lessons in cosmogony from the Om, during which ideas were imparted to his mind by that divine intelligence not through the linear accumulation of logical precepts and conclusions, but instantaneously, in the form of \\"conceptual edifices, staggering structures of living thought, as intricate as cities.\\"<br /><br />I would like to close with a playful conjecture in which two of the main conceptual flaws I encountered while reading Proof of Heaven seem to come together to explain and cancel each another out. The first is simply the prima facie implausibility, the blatant non sequitur, of a passionate exhortation that a dimensional next to whose complexity our own world pales in comparison consists of no more than a hole in the ground, a garish landscape of glittering trees, and a black sphere at the center of a void. The second is that, presupposing the truth of his claim that the physical and spiritual realms are necessarily separate to allow for the spiritual growth of human souls on Earth, his book constitutes an unlawful breach of the divine order--for just as the importance of faith to Christianity would be immediately subjugated if God deigned to provide scientifically verifiable evidence of His existence, so proof of consciousness in the absence of neocortical function would conflate the physical and spiritual realms and subvert the conditions which it has pleased the Om to impose on humankind in the interests of our spiritual progress.<br /><br />It will be seen, albeit with a rather gymnastic saltus of logic, how one could develop the argument that the former safeguards against the latter and that the manifest implausibility of his claim is actually proof of its ultimate veracity.

B00BSBUZPK|1.0|There some people out there that still believe Henley And Frey are The Eagles. If you are told something enough you tend to believe it such as America is the greatest country in the world. Hate to burst some bubbles but both are wrong. Im not surprised to see Henley and Frey dominate on screen a band is made up of however many members there are and should be equal. How would Hotel California sound if there were no guitar player??? pretty lame. Anyway Glenn Frey is either a Sociopath or insecure to the highest level it goes to show money doesent buy happiness because he comes across as bitter and angry why so angry Glenn you must have a billion dollars by now. $140 for an Eagles ticket haha i wouldnt have paid that back in 1975 i sure wouldnt pay it now your prime days are gone. I just cant stand to see such an attitude. Anyway there is something i wanna mention as a humor junkie remember the part where The Eagles did that benefit concert for Senator Cranston (spelling mistake maybe???) Don Felder says your welcome and then says I GUESS to me that is a little immature but funny. As you watch Glen Frey tell the story and after Henley says i guess it flashes to Felder quickly and i would swear from the look on Felders face he finds it funny as well. Glenn Frey didnt find it funny but wow talk about immature he sure handled it well didnt he what a crazy stupid temper he has. Control freaks like Glenn Frey dont like people who speak their mind and stand up for themselves they expect everyone to be yes men. Don Felder made some mistakes but the video further shows what scrooges and bullies Don and Glenn are. For those who dont know Felder did write the music to Hotel California but nowhere did you see Frey or Henley or anyone for that matter at least give him credit for it. Don Henley needs to not take himself so seriously!!! yes Don you are smart and well spoken but has no charisma. If i had his ability and money id be smiling all the time. Don Felder has aged the best and that is what comes from not being in a bad marriage and when i say bad marriage i mean married to The Eagles. Also the words Alpha Male were used a few times in this documentary who are the Alpha Males in this band??? the answer is none. Unless you call being a temper tantrum,insecure control freak an Alpha Male. Don Felder did whine a little here and there but it was Don and Glen for the most part that acted like it was their time of the month. Randy Meisner came across as the most kind level headed and confident member and had the purest voice. Don Henley and Glenn Frey over estimate their own contributions to the band a decent amount of their songs werent fully written by either of them. Sometimes i wondered if they thought they were The Beatles. Would i go see The Eagles today??? nope not unless the ticket prices were more realistic and the set list was changed to include some non hits. For anyone who hasnt heard of the band  Poco  you need to check out them out they were every bit as good as The Eagles. Commercial success doesent exactly equal greatness.nd that is what comes from not being in a bad marriage and when i say bad marriage i mean married to The Eagles.

B00C7607BC|4.0|I was happy to finally be able to own The Little Mermaid on DVD and static to have it on digital format.It was disappointing that the new HD version as they are advertising it as is not really any sharper than what I remember looking at as a kid. The magic of the Little Mermaid is not diminished, but I believe the hype of \\"RE- MASTERED\\" doesn't live up to expectations. So if you just want to finally own a copy of it on DVD or Blu Ray and the Digital Copy for ON THE GO.. go for it. I am actually having to repurchase this because the first one I bought I made the mistake of getting the Diamond Edition and it didn't come with the Digital copy, and to get the digital copy is $20 dollars all by itself.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Zombie movies can become predictably boring, but I found myself engrossed in World War Z from beginning to end. I highly recommend it!
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|First off, let me state that I'm not the kind of person whom normally gets \\"scared\\" of movies. I've watched the Exorcist plenty of times. For me, a movie is only as good as it's story. If there are a few scares thrown in, that's always good, but the scares are only going to get you once and then the next time you watch it, you already know what's coming. That being said, The Conjuring actually had me shaking the first time I watched it. The last 15 minutes were more intense than anything in my first viewing of the Exorcist. The comparisons to The Exorcist are inevitable. More so because it's the only movie in league with The Conjuring than because it's the same type of film (demonic entities, exorcism, and possession)<br /><br />The acting; the story; the sets; the sound design; the camera work; all of it is done perfectly, allowing you to go on a journey with this family and experience the horror as they experience it. The story itself is base on a true one, and all you need to do is Google search it to find out that it's no joke. In fact, Hollywood actually had to dub down this story. The real one took place over a nearly a decade's worth of time, and some of the stuff that happened had to be altered because producers though nobody would actually believe the stuff that really happened if they saw it on screen!<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys a good thriller or supernatural story owes it to themselves to give The Conjuring a look. It's not really a \\"horror\\" film per-say, but it's a darn good film regardless!

I even gave theae books to my boss they were really a breath of fresh air...I cannot wait to watch the movies even with all the hate I believe they will be just as amazing as the books themselves were. Anyone who loves a kinky romance will not be able to put this book, or the others down

The interplay between the main characters (The Doctor, Rose, Mickey, Jack) is fun and oddly believable considering this is a kid's sci-fi show at it's heart. And yes, it has heart.  And wait till you meet Dickens!

B0081336FO|5.0|From the acting to the writing to the set design and on, this is one of the best quality shows on television. Reams have been written on how good this show is, so take our word for it. Watch it. If you love Doyle or just quality tv, you'll enjoy it. Of course, it's sexed up, so not appropriate for the under, what? 12? 14? Frankly, I wouldn't have let mine watch this till 16 (dominatrix in the first episode--I'm strict), but the Baskerville is an excellent retelling, as is A Scandal in Belgravia. And the finale (which I think might be disturbing for younger viewers, as well).

B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride put the player in control of a crazy jetpack yielding fellow trying to get through an expansive underground scientific facility. The game-play mechanics are really fairly simple. The jetpack guy moves forward with the player controlling whether the jetpack fires or not, moving the jetpack fellow up and down on the screen as he moves forward. As one progresses further and further in distance, the screen moves faster and faster so that things come at the jetpack guy at a quicker pace. It turns the game into a sort of twitch game with is as much about precision as reaction time.<br /><br />The general point is to get as far as possible while avoiding lasers and fiery barriers.  The game provides other goals as well, such as collecting certain amounts of coins during a flying session, using different types of vehicles (that appear as power-ups during play), the distance one tumbles after dying and giving high fives to the scientists that wander the halls you fly through.<br /><br />Collecting coins adds another aspect to the game with which players can \\"buy\\" items in a store. Some of said items are cosmetic such as glasses or different clothes for the jetpack guy, others serve as power-ups that improve speed, jumping, jetpack efficiency and the like.  As one plays, the game gives players various goals to reach. Achieving those goals allows to player to level up to earn additional rewards and coins.<br /><br />Jetpack Joyride is a fairly simple game but it's surprisingly addictive. With a repetitive but fun soundtrack and driving twitchy gameplay, this is a great game to play when you have a few minutes to waste.<br /><br />Jetpack Joyride is easily one of the better free games for handhelds out there at the moment.

While reading through it, you get the feel there should be more. More jokes, references to the fairy tale literature, character and plot development, etc. There is more to the series that this volume and my interest is piqued enough to continue into the next installment. It won't take much improvement to make this a really good series, the elements are definitely there.

One word...WOW.  Specifically &#34;Forbidden Friendship&#34;, &#34;Test Drive&#34;, and &#34;Romantic Flight&#34;, the end of &#34;Coming Back Around&#34;, and a few others.  I and all of my kids love this music and play it on the computer and in my truck.  The music really tells a story, and you can just picture the scenes from the movie as you hear them.  Those favorites tracks are rich instrumental scores, and reminds us of the feel and sound of scores from Transformers or Time Machine.  I would recommend this.

Perhaps there is something really special about ginger cats!  May James and Bob live together  for many years to come - and hopefully another book will ensue.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love Castle and love to hear and have the opportunity to read the books as well.<br />Would recommend these items to every one
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Like many others, I had been anxiously awaiting this album. It was a long time coming, but so worth it. I love every second of this entire album and it is easily one of my favorites in quite a while.<br />This isn't quite the &#34;Happy when it Rains&#34; that we were all so used to, either. A bit &#34;darker&#34;, a smidge industrialized, still powerful, and still very much the Garbage that I've known and loved for so long. I literally had this CD in my car for weeks on repeat and still crave to listen.<br />If you are looking but unsure, leap. You won't regret it.
078689136X|5.0|I love the idea of getting books to coordinate with the series CASTLE.  But I am curious about the actual author. But a<br />great job.
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|Probably like many others, I bought this album solely because of the song &#34;Somebody that I used to Know&#34;, hoping that I would also love the rest. I personally didn't care for the rest of the album, except for &#34;Easy way Out&#34;. Guess it wasn't really my style, but still worth a listen.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I LIKE TO HAVE SERIES IN MY LIBRARY TO HAVE TO WATCH OVER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU CAN MISS GREAT THINGS.<br />THERE IS HUMOR - ROMANCE- MYSTERY-- EVERYTHING FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|If you think Gatsby benefits from a soundtrack with a lot of rap music, you may enjoy this. Otherwise, you will likely find it pretentious, boring, poorly acted and directed with an eye towards self-indulgence rather than storytelling.
B003L77FYS|5.0|A GREAT IDEA AS ALWAYS. I AM A GREAT FAN AND I LOVE THIS SERIES.  YOU HAVE TO BUY THE SEASON FOR<br />THE LIBRARY. NATHAN AND STANA ARE GREAT TOGETHER.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|great quality and great movie. I have never a single problem getting movies online. The price is great the shipping is great too and the movie is one of the best movies I´ve ever seen.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with the 3rd season... based on other tv shows, this is often the downfall as writers get bored or run out of ideas.  But was pleasantly surprised by the continued excellent quality.<br /><br />Too bad they had to involve Shirley MacLaine... she looks terrible, is a stooped wrinkled old lady and still as kooky and arrogant as ever... a distraction, not at all charming like Maggie Smith.  She is a distraction and a detraction from the show, not an enhancement.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app was awesome until recently, I logged out one day and tried to get back in, and it said kik is not working, try again. The new update screwed it up. Don't get!
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|Awesome songs! SMS Bangerz the song is the only one that is not as good as the rest. MILEY's voice is amazing and unique!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I found this device so useful. it was exactly what the kindle needed. it is very sturdy and looks very strong. it also charges rapidly. I was pleased. Amazon gave it to me for free too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Hidden gem of digital streaming i love this little device works great, i stream movies off my PC HDD right to the TV
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I didn't understand why I had to sign up to use this free bible. Also you cant use it offline.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|When I think of CCR, these are the songs I want. Great price, great songs, great quality. Glad to have this on my music list
B000AOEMXM|5.0|This was the series killed by all those whining trekkies who have always resisted anything new added to the canon of traditional Trek lore. Enterprise is mostly faithfull to that premise, adding some new themes, but largely staying true to the canon. Set 100 years before Kirk/Spock, the series details the very beginnings of what will become the Federation. A truly excellent series, fully the equal of the the other major Trek series.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I was doing so well in the game and I clicked on the app; all of my progress were gone. What the heck was that for????
B004GYY714|5.0|I can't blieve even the free version has so much to offer. Radio on demand from just about anywhere. I am hopelessly hooked.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Riveting .  We looked at all seasons in a marathon viewing session . The characters were ambitious, manipulative , clever, well spoken , without boundaries - thoroughly unlike able but incredible to watch.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Great season and they keep getting better and better as every season goes on.The cast just gets makes me warch them over and over.
B0047685I2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  This is the very best telling of the story.  NO other comes close.  Excellent for little girls.  Gives a much more realistic approach, and Cinderella isn't some helpless doormat!  Love it!!!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|For a couple of years, I have watched Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman before I go to bed. It takes my mind off the nightly news, gives me a chance to see a responsible character at work in her society and, hey!, lets me feast my eyes on good looking people.
1401233791|4.0|i read this comic series in part when I was younger. couldn't read them all cause my drug store that I bought them at didn't carry all the name of DC comics that this series crossed over. I.e. Detective Comics, Batman, shadow of the bat etc. They are all here and before each section has the artwork of the original comic. Love it ... bring back memories. For the new reader: awesome storyline covering years of comics. Storyline had to influence the new movie somewhat... there are obvious similarities. Also Vol 1 includes a comic not in the original knightfall/knightsquest/knights end story line but explains Banes origins and his hatred for Batman.
B0047T86G0|1.0|This Oxford Dictionary of English (Kindle edition) does not include the pronunciation of words. I quickly switched to the American dictionary, which does.
1451629192|5.0|This brave young woman somehow finds a way to eloquently tell the most horrific and unimaginable story. It is a gut-wrenching book, but by deciding to join her on the journey to healing, you will find yourself inspired, uplifted, and motivated. She is a fine writer, and from a purely literary point of view, the narrative was well written, and reads a little like a journal. Highly highly recommend.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|This was another great movie. However I may be biased cause I \\"fell in love/lust/obsession\\" with Traci Dinwiddie (think thats right).<br />The movie was great, drew me in from the beginning, chemistry was great...acting was a bit blah at times, but in the end the movie was<br />great.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book for any 80s geeks! Even if you aren't a gamer, this is a fun adventure. Knowing some games helps but isn't necessary as the author does explain it without dragging the info out. Pacing was good, terminology easy, characters were distinct and strong, goals/motivations and conflicts were clear.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I was a big fan of the original series, but despite that I really enjoyed the original re-boot movie.  This second one, though, is just a huge waste of time.  The plot didn't make any sense and the characters made stupid decisions and there were so many callbacks to the original movies/series (in the wrong order) that you wonder why they didn't bring along an actual story with them instead of just shooting a lot.  I really like Benedict Cumberpatch in other things he's been in, but I think we was severely underused in this movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this a good app I like it because it helps me on my homework and when I calculate stuff and tells me the answers for my homework
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I expect a good book from Stephen King and he delivered an excellent book.<br />Had a hard time putting it down.<br />Recommend this one to everybody who loved the Shining.
B005CRQ4WO|4.0|I really love this book,then only thing I can say is that there were some words that weren't translate and would be great if It could be in Mexican-Spanish.<br />Great book,
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I tried to read the book, but gave up after about 50 pages.  Not worth the time or effort.  Movie is great.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game I'm on it all the. Time  I wish I New more of the game like if I had book of the rules that would help me more  this I only  game I play 90 percent of the time.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I enjoyed reading Piper's story. So unfair how sentencing goes on some cases opposed to some others. Very informative on how our prison systems are run and the court's in general , sentencing and the unfair treatments going on behind bars. I'm looking forward to watching the Netflix series after getting to know Piper and the friends she made along the way thru her book. Thank you for sharing your story Piper.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game I wish they have you mor gold though<br />If you other players want to add me 4567awesome
B00FMPCMRM|5.0|This was a great first episode back. It brought us all up to where they are now and gave us a lot to think about as far as where they are going.<br />The music is, as always, flawless. My piano teacher, Carol Montelongo of Apple Valley, has taught me all of the music so far. It is all fabulous on the piano!<br />Way to go Vamp Diaries you're keeping it real!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is really fun. After 8-some hours total, I unlocked all the extra content for free.  I am still waiting for the next expansion pack.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I think this app is a very fun app because the sugar falls out of the comma and then you try to get the sugar into the cup(s) by drawing a line to the cup(s)
1419387243|4.0|My daughter adores this book. She made me read it and I don't regret it. I only wish I had found it much earlier in my life. My fifteen year old self would've probably adored it too. The adult version of me wanted just a little something more.<br /><br />I probably spoiled this story for myself by seeing the movie first. I knew the big reveal before I ever read a word and that is a crying shame. For some reason, the movie moved me more than the book and I feel that this was due in part to the one sided narration and probably in part to my general black-heartedness. This book is written by Charlie in a series of letters addressed only to a \\"Dear Friend\\". This format didn't entirely work for me because everyone else became a peripheral character that I never became all that emotionally invested in. They popped into scenes but never truly came to life in the way that Charlie does or, dare I say, the way they did in the movie. Especially Patrick and Sam. Those kids, including the actor who plays Charlie, were amazing in their roles. Read the book first and then see the movie if you missed it during its theatrical run. It is truly something special. Even the trailer has the ability to make me go all weepy.<br /><br />Now about the book.<br /><br />Charlie is starting his freshman year of high school with no friends but he has a family who loves him. He's overly sensitive, intelligent, sweet and nursing the pain of losing his best childhood friend to suicide. He is awkward and a wallflower and when a teacher he admires tells him that he needs to participate in life he tries his best to take that advice to heart. He is befriended by Patrick, an older outgoing boy, and his beautiful step-sister Sam whom Charlie secretly loves but she's dating a guy who is all wrong for her. They all have their issues and make mistakes as they're finding themselves. Just like most teenagers. It all felt very real, with a note of sadness looming overhead, and I can completely understand why it is so beloved by many. Still, it didn't floor me emotionally the way I thought it might because of the way the story was told. I was hoping for an unforgettable five star read but this didn't quite get there.t is so beloved by many. Still, it didn't floor me emotionally the way I thought it might because of the way the story was told. I was hoping for an unforgettable five star read but this didn't quite get there.
B008Y212PI|5.0|this game is an amazing game that keeps you busy for awhile, while also having fun!!! and you work on math skills, even tho you don't even realize it!!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|The Paradigm Shift is only an album the Korn can make. It's also an album that they could only make now. It pulls from their entire career and forms what can only be called the Korn of 2013. There is something for every Korn fan.<br /><br />Having Head return to the band is a huge boon that shows on every mindboggling riff in every track. Munky held down the fort for many years, but his other half is back and they've created some of the best shredding to date. It's heavy,it's crazy melodic, it's creepy and it soars. This let Fieldy get back into his sweet spot, right in between them. He's not buried in the mix, he's bopping and thumping in the open spots, laying down that groove that only he can do. There's less of his 'clicks' and more of a tradition bass tone, but he is having a blast on every track (Wish I Wasn't Born Today is a real highlight). Ray gets to flex his incredible talent here as well. While he was given the back seat in the creation of the last album, he runs with Fieldy here at every step. They play so well together, it's a joy to listen to. He's not David Silveria and he does not play like David. He's Ray Luzier and he can play and create with the best of them. He fits so well with the original guys it's a small miracle they found him. His passion for music runs through his veins, he was probably born with drum sticks in his hands. The Korn Groove is undeniable here. That leaves us with Jonathan Davis who gives us one of his best performances. There is a ton of variety, the choruses are the shit. Epic drops and tempo changes, some of the greatest sing along chorus's since Untouchables.<br /><br />A big turn off for people on Path was that the electronics were all in EDM style. It was Korn fused with EDM drum/dub/bass/etc. On TPS the electronics are all over the album, but they are much more integrated into Korn's specific style like Issues, Untouchables and Untitled. They are weaved in a much more nuanced, balanced and creative way. It's epic sounding.<br /><br />Korn has always been about the sum of it's parts. Each guy brings something to the table and when they are firing on all cylinders, they create amazing music. The production and mix is fantastic, you can hear each element clearly and with authority. Each track is placed with careful purpose, the album feels like it breathes as it plays on. The creativity and focus on The Paradigm Shift makes it one of the best Korn albums ever made, I can't describe how happy I am about how this turned out. There is an insane amount of awesome songs. Prey For Me absolutely crushes, Spike In My Veins is wild, Punishment Time rules, Victimized is downright awe inspiring and Paranoid & Aroused is one of the best songs Korn has ever written. Get the Deluxe Edition, even the bonus tracks rule!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book has everything from emotion to laughter, o be of the best books I have read in a wile.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It had more depth than I expected and Matthew Mc was good. I can recommend this movie, especially for MM fans.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Exactly what we expected! Loved it!! Cant wait to order the next season once it is released to amazon :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is, like I said, my daily indulgence. It is fast, fun, and challenging. If I wake up in the middle of the night I reach for my kindle to play spider till my eyes get heavy again.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|The best calculator I have ever used this app is the best if you need a calculator get this one
1118490371|4.0|This is your typical &#34;dummies&#34; book.<br />Written at a level for even the most novice person.<br />I would recommend this book if you were looking to begin your VBA knowledge base.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Grew up with Sonny and Cher.  Loved their music dearly. Cher has continued that love of music for me.  RED will be a number one hit. Mark my words!
B004CRR9G0|4.0|Have loved this cartoon for years, only it was under a different name back then.<br />so happy to've found it again.
B009OA57MI|1.0|I downloaded this game tried to play it and my screen kept flipping upside down so i uninstalled it and tried again, still didnt work. Waste if three dollars
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book is very wel written and organized. It talks about the main aspects of our food system and the &#34;real&#34; alternatives that we have. This book present us with a very relevant dilemma in our times, which is what we eat? how do we know what is in our food? and what are the consequences of our food system? Excelent book.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|First off, the first track, \\"Cry of Achilles\\" is the perfect opening track for the album! I think their opening tracks keep getting better and better because I loved \\"Slip to the Void,\\" but I think I like this one even more. Next up, the single \\"Addicted To Pain\\" is pretty good and I guess a good choice for a single, but I like \\"Bleed it Dry\\" more. \\"Waters Rising\\" is another highlight of the album, and finally, \\"Fortress\\" is a great closer. It almost rivals the song \\"Blackbird\\" in it's epic-ness! The only songs I didn't care that much for were \\"Peace is Broken\\" and \\"All Ends Well.\\" Bottom line: If you didn't like AB before, you aren't gonna like 'em now. However, if you do like them at all, you're gonna love this album!
1572816112|4.0|First off, the art is fantastic! I am a fan of creepy or slightly unsettling art and do not find this deck to be too creepy. I do feel as though I will be able to get an accurate read, as opposed to some of my other gothic or dark themed decks which seem to always give negative readings.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the cards are a little inconsistent in how they are labeled. For example, all of the major cards have their Roman numeral at the top AND a bar across the bottom saying the name of the card, except for 'Death' which is not labeled on the bottom and only has the Roman numeral. For the minor cards, the court cards and aces are labeled with their names and roman numerals, but 2 through 10 have only Roman numerals. Also, the tiny bit of color that frames each card varies randomly through the major arcana. Some are red, some black, some blue, some purple, and some green. The minor cards are more consistent with the color of the frame changing for each suit instead of randomly. The small book that came with the deck does not explain why any of these choices were made, so I am left a bit confused. I wish all the cards had only been labeled with a Roman numeral, or at least that the bar with the names had been consistently on all the cards.
B00DZAWPNM|3.0|I wanted to love this album. I really did, but unfortunately I only find it decent. I want to say, I love the song \\"Miss Jackson\\" and the video of it. It's a great song! However, there aren't enough great songs on the album. \\"Casual Affair\\" is pretty good along with \\"Nicotine\\" and \\"This is Gospel.\\" The rest of the songs are either so-so or I didn't like them at all. I really liked the album Vices and Virtues a lot. I was hoping this would be equally as good, or better. It; unfortunately, was not.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I had ordered this in a different format! I DO NOT LIKE THE LETTER BOX on my TV! I ordered 1:85 aspect ratio widescreen that has NO letterbox on my 42&#34; TV! You sent one with 2:45 aspect ratio with letter box! I will not order anymore Movies unless it has no letter box! I bought a widescreen TV to get rid of that! I thought it was what I ordered but was sent the other movie! Thank You! I like the movie but want to see more of it on my TV! Carson
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The beginning of the novel seemed rushed and I found myself lost in all the introductions of the main characters. However, once I got the characters distinguished, I couldn't but the book down - such a great ending! This book has a thoughtful central message about life and the way people live it. Definitely put some things in perspective for me...
B0089LOG02|4.0|I did not know about this facet of history.  The author does a nice job bringing the past into the present.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Made me think on each level and I am addicted to the game. Can't wait for more levels.  You won't be able to put the game down.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|A good puzzler that isn't all hidden object.  Finished in a couple of hours without hints.  Overall one of the better ones in this area.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It is a short and all the most important thing you need to know about your life. Great book ! Thank you !
1405911662|4.0|Liane Moriarty has a gift for creating interesting, compelling characters and drawing them together in a plot that has some surprising twists and turns. This is not a mystery--but there is a mystery--and suspense in this novel. This is not a comedy-- but you will find yourself laughing at times. This is not a typical romance-- but there are issues of love, fidelity, and loyalty. So what is it? A very readable book, deftly written with strong characterizations that will keep you involved until the very end. The author has a very recognizable style, also present in &#34;What Alice Forgot,&#34; another worthwhile novel she has written.
B005LAII62|4.0|I got this for my daughters birthday too and she loved it! We watched it as a family. Cute movie. :)
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|These is an update that's needed on my Kindle Fire and its not allowing it to update so we can't play. This is frustrating. Please fix this.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|This is my daughters favorite movie so I got it for her for her birthday. She never gets bored of it! Cute movie. :)
B00915G6MG|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better every year.  The characters become more complex and the plots really draw me in.  I love the story arcs and how they keep finding new ways to tell the story.  In many ways, this was the hardest season to watch as the characters have had to face truly life-changing events but it still remains true to who these people are and the relationships between them.  It was nice to see them focusing on some of the other members of the team and it was a non-stop roller coaster from the first episode to the last
B008R14YBK|4.0|I got this for my daughters birthday and she loved it! It was perfect to give her along with her little boombox. :)
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very fast paced, involving game!highly addictive, fun, super entertaining, never ending excitement. Makes you want to bag up stuff at the supermarket!!
B003ES61EE|1.0|The sponge was mucky and the brush bristles just keep falling out! Just not worth sending the item back. Don't waste your money.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I liked the story line and the writing but it was just so full of angst and beaucoup hand wringing for my taste.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great if you have a tablet, or a place to charge your phone near your TV. Otherwise you'll be frustrated when your phone is dying and then you have no alternate means of controlling your Chromecast. Other than that, this device works amazingly well. Must buy if you don't have a smart TV.
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham in the introduction to the paper copy I started reading stated that this was his favourite book and that it is basically autobiographical which endeared the book to me.<br />The court process of the strutting peacocks at the bar was comical to me in a tragic kind of way because of the disingenuous grandstanding.<br />I watched the movie 2 nights ago and really enjoyed it as well
B001UG4VWQ|1.0|It was probably my fault for not reading the description completely.  The show was not made to play in the USA  It was for a different region and was totally useless to me.  I just threw it away.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Simple but makes you think about each cut. Like the cutting sounds of the scissors. Good game for all ages.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Elton John is still making some great music, and this cd had lots of it, so I enjoyed the cd.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I know Oceania is a part of the Teargarden By Kaleidyscope project but it doesn't fit the sound of TBK, it does however it does feel more like Mary Star Of The Sea and American Gothic.<br /><br />The production, music, lyrics, and performance's are really good.<br /><br />I do think this album is a return to form, Zeitgeist was a great album but not many people got it, American Gothic flew under the radar, and Teargarden By Kaleidyscope has been hit and miss, but this album is a crowd pleaser.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I have always enjoyed Alan's recordings and got a lot of his CDs but I really enjoyed this one. I lost my husband last November. He was a big Alan Jackson fan as am I. He also loved Bluegrass music and played the fiddle behind a lot of different musicians over the years. He would have loved this also. So congrads to Alan for trying something he always wanted to do.
B00DZHX7ZU|5.0|The Airplane Flies High (B-Side Box Set), is a collection of b-side from the Mellon Collie singles, the amazing thing is that many of the b-sides are better than the album tracks.<br /><br />Example : Ugly, Cherry, Set the Ray to Jerry, God, Mouths of Babes, Marquis in Spades, Pennies, Meladori Magpie, Rotten Apples, Jupiter's Lament, Medellia of the Gray Skies, Blank, The Last Song, The Airplane Flies High, and Transforme could have easily replaced weaker Mellon Collie songs like : Cupid de Locke, Take Me Down, We Only Come Out at Night, Beautiful, Lily My One and Only, By Starlight, or Farewell and Goodnight.<br /><br />If you want to buy the whole box set like did than go ahead, I can't think of a better way to spend forty five dollars.<br /><br />If you just want the best of the best from the box set than just buy : Ugly, Cherry, Set the Ray to Jerry, God, Mouths of Babes, Marquis in Spades, Pennies, Meladori Magpie, Rotten Apples, Jupiter's Lament, Medellia of the Gray Skies, Blank, The Last Song, The Airplane Flies High, and Transforme.<br /><br />Also, one last piece of advice, don't buy the edited version of the album, be sure to buy the explicit version.<br /><br />All in all five stars!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I enjoy this game so much, I was sad when I finally completed it so I restarted from scratch.  Just as fun the 2nd time around. Best solitaire game yet!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is awsome........... when it is working. Which is like NEVER!!!!! I got it and for the first month or so it was so cool and I was on it all the time. But it kept freezing and saying it stopped and then shuts down. so I logged myself off and now it won't let me log back in. I tried to delete the app, shut off my device, call the people.......... nothing works because this app wasn't well thought out nor programmed well. Trust me it's not worth your time.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I tried this on my kindle fire just as an extra option when I travel, as I always take my kindle with me.  But it was uncomfortable, as you'd have to turn your kindle on first and load the ap.  All this time, the alarm just kept ringing. I thought it would be like my phone, where it just turns on and the alarm shows on the screen so you can just turn it off without having to get into the phone first.  It's just too much to do while you;re still trying to wake up
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator. It is very easy to use. Although, I do not use it every day, it comes in real handy in a pinch.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|The plot is his most outlandish yet and the ending was beyond anticlimactic. The book essentially ended 50 pages before he stopped writing and the final pages are like a boring lecture. Time for both Robert Langdon and Dan Brown to retire.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I was never a Miley Cyrus fan so I am surprised myself that I've taken time to write this review. For me her music was always too cute, too Disney and too mainstream. Unlike her peers such as Katy Perry who's goal is to make the radio industry happy with a never endless supply of happy go lucky songs, Miley finally did something that sets her apart and I like it.<br /><br />It's by no means a pop musical masterpiece, but it is creative, fun and catchy. I can certainly appreciate that. The first thing that I noticed was the lyrics. It's not your typical I love you, you love me la la la... Each song is unique, tells a story of deception and heartbreak but then in the next track she will be rapping about donuts and driving around on a \\"4x4!\\"<br /><br />And once you put that song on it's all over... the beat will repeat over and over in your head, Round and round and away we go. Four by four and away we go...High not low and away we go... And if you're a southern gal like myself you'll really dig it.<br /><br />The production is good although many of the beats are nothing new. And the only artist collaboration that stood out to me was Nelly. It made me realize how much I miss his flow.<br /><br />\\"On My Own\\" which is my favorite track on the album is only on the deluxe version but it sorta takes me back to the days of Bobby Brown and his whole rebel attitude which he brought through many of his songs like \\"My Prerogative.\\" I love it!<br /><br />All of the ballads are all really nice. \\"Rooting For My Baby\\" is a breezy mid tempo number with Miley singing... I know, I know, that you go through a lot, I know I know the pressure makes you hot. And then \\"Someone Else\\" is dramatic and pretty amazing especially the end chrous.<br /><br />My only disappointment is her collaboration with the beautiful Pop Princess Britney Spears. You'd think on the title track \\"BANGERZ\\" these two would really go back and forth and rock it out together, but I barely heard Brit on this track. Was a real let down in that regard.... but as a Miley song it was still really good. It's definitely something Britney might have released on her album \\"Black Out.\\"<br /><br />Although not as good as when Gwen Stefani's incredible creative masterpiece that was \\"Love.Angel.Music.Baby\\", it's still something different we rarely see from female artists these days. Well maybe except Lady GAGA, but that is it. They are either too serious or too sappy.<br /><br />So yeah she is pushing buttons with her attitude and her raunchy behavior but she seems to be in control despite what Sinead O'Connor says. So let's wait and see what else Miley has up her sleeve before we pass judgment on her. Preview the album and see for yourself. You just might be surprised the way I was!real let down in that regard.... but as a Miley song it was still really good.

B003B5DNJQ|5.0|I needed a new card since I was selling my Olympus digital camera. It arrived in great condition and on time. Thanks.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I enjoyed going back into the world of Oryx and Crake and for the most part enjoyed this book, although it was not my favorite of the trilogy.  I think the way that Atwood plays out the concepts of unfettered commercialism and privatization of government functions and biotech advances is interesting and often fun.  I really loved the way she conveyed how quickly a religion can begin and how easily doctrines arise from that. However, for me, the telling of so much of the story through storytelling between the characters got to be a little much -- especially the amazing adventures of Zeb as told to Toby.  The level of his insight and analysis seemed unrealistic, and the sheer number and complexity of his amazing adventures finally felt too far-fetched -- even in a far-fetched world.  A last thing:  Since I just finished the book, there was one thing that really bugged me at the end (trying not to have a spoiler in here):  Why were Ren and Amanda so unaffected by the implied rape by four Craker males at the very beginning, especially given the end result?  Their friends seemed to shrug it off as well.  It seemed odd to me that Atwood let this whole plot line go with no exploration, as if it were not a big deal.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Rented this with my girlfriend one night just on a whim and we were both really entertained. Animation was solid and the concept was pretty interesting. Lots of funny spots that I think adults and kids would appreciate.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|it wont Intall it says it cant install it at this. time I think that's full of crape !!! I think that is not fair I was so excited to use this app but it failed.
B004U7JYXS|4.0|There's not much to say about this film- it does what it's supposed to do. I gave it four stars mainly because it's still fairly expensive which is a bummer considering how tempting it is to blow through an entire pack because polaroids are fun. Also, it seems as though it's more difficult if not impossible to separate the film from the card if you're interested in any alternative applications.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Thank you for finally producing a cd that I actually say the myself and my sons can enjoy. . .
B00594XOZU|5.0|i LOVE this app its the best texting app. I always use it but i don't know what's going on. it says &quot;longer than it should try later in a little bit&quot;. i do that but nothing. ive tried it on my phone and it does work but it don't on my kindle. Now i have to use lame texting apps. i have tried turning on and off my wifi,, tried to delete it and nothing . PLEASE fix it SOON!!! i want to use it.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I downloaded this app, hit the icon and up popped the calendar. Ok...no instructions just tabs to choose a calendar format. Could not enter any info in the individual days. So how come no 'welcome to calengoo and here's how to use it'.  I am a novice and need more instructions for my $6! Not a happy customer.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This an outstanding device.  Easy to set up.  True plug and play.  It was up and running in 5 min.  I must confess that my needs are simple though.  I watched You tube videos and videos via the Chrome web browser.  Both audio and video were very high quality.  No buffering or any such problems.  I do have fairly high speed internet through my cable company -- that might be the reason behind my good experience.  True HD from You tube, and 720p or more via Chrome.  I did it through both my iPhone (no Chrome on iPhone though) and my laptop.  I am going to buy another one for another TV in the house.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. I play every day. However, recently I have had many technical difficulties.  The screen either freezes or will continue to try to load.  I have lost a number of chips and tokens and though support is willing to reimburse it is very frustrating. Also reimbursement won't happen unless you know the amount which is difficult to know when playing the slots.  My feeling is that it has to do with the latest upgrade (bummer)...I even get a message every so often to reload...please fix the glitches!!! :<
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Exactly what i've been waiting for since tremonti released his last cd, which we all know was amazing. It's just an amazing cd with dark vocals and amazing riffs. Alter bridge is such a mature band lyrically and instrumently, it puts other bands to shame. I honestly don't know why these guy don't get the credit they absolutely deserve, it always blows my mind. With Tremonti you can never go wrong. Buy it, enough said.

B00DURGZHW|5.0|The story was very touching.  Mattew McConaughey was fantastic and the look they gave him was so different from his usual leading man look.  The teeth were so key to convincing the audience of his hard life.

0307279189|5.0|really good read even if you aren't a runner and it makes me want to get out and run.  maybe even run barefoot.  maybe even run ultras...well, maybe not an ultra.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, and I think that this could turn into one of my new favorite series. I would agree with some of the other comments though, it felt a bit rushed. While the premise was exciting, the characterization was kind of weak.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|The remarkable thing about Yuja Wang is that she has somehow leap-frogged over her immediate Chinese predecessors, Lang Lang and Yundi, in her musicality. There's not the slightest hint that anything she has recorded, from Scarlatti to Ligeti, is foreign to her imagination. Where the other two superstars either avoid the Austro-German tradition or seem rather faceless in it (see Yundi's recent Beethoven album for DG), Wang made a superb recording of the Brahms Paganini Variations. She has every reason to be everyone's critical darling, especially when you consider her gossamer touch that seemingly overcomes all difficulties with a lovely sense of grace.<br /><br />If grace were ever needed, it's in the two concertos on this program, the Rachmaninov Third, with its exhausting overlay of big chords and rapid fingerwork, and the Prokofiev Second, which takes his kinetic, spiky keyboard style to the max. The lead review notes the freshness of the music-making here, and I'd even add \\"affection.\\" The Simon Bolivar Orchestra no longer bills itself as \\"Youth\\" anymore - I hope this means the older members are allowed to stay on rather than leaving after a certain age - but they perform Rachmaninov's accompaniment with a song in their hearts. Comparisons with great European and American orchestras are irrelevant, and Wang matches Dudamel with playing that's just as fresh and affectionate. Horowitz owned the Rachmaninov Third, and yet without imitating his high-voltage acrobatics (if that's permissible English), Wang's brilliance in the finale seems so impossibly feathery and powerful at the same time that it, too, traps lightning in a bottle.<br /><br />Prokofiev's best works create their own quirky atmosphere, by turns witty, soulful, sarcastic, and barbaric. A bit of all these moods is present in the fascinating Second Cto. Its wild stylistic variety makes up for the lack of memorable melodies present in Cto. no. 3. In both works Prokofiev the pianist shows off every facet of his abilities. \\"Variety\\" is also the right word for this reading, where Dudamel and Wang bring out a host of moods and colors. There is more for the orchestra to do than in the Rachmaninov, and clearly they relish every opportunity. I have never been so engaged in the music. As before, Wang is at pains never to sound muscular and motorized; the hammering finale is scintillating without threatening to give the listener a headache. It could be offered, even at Yuja Wang's young age, 26, as evidence that she is a great pianist, without reservation.of his abilities. \\"Variety\\" is also the right word for this reading, where Dudamel and Wang bring out a host of moods and colors.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Keeps you reading and wanting more, book after book.  Better than the series.  My imagination went into overdrive.  I always say the book is better.  The movie brings it to life, but the book tells it like the author meant for it to be.  You will love this book as much as the series.  Each is riveting.  Enjoy, happy reading.  I'm going in for my 2nd reading to pick up what I missed the 1st time.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|I only have 2 cats, so the author is one up on me. Even though I am not as fortunate as Ms. Surovec, I can totally identify with everything in this book. The pics with all those adorable kittens all around - just a visual depiction of my dreams.<br /><br />This book is spot-on. If you have and love cats, it is a MUST! If you don't have any and never gave cats much thought, beware! You may suddenly realize you've never lived a perfect life and be compelled to enhance your life with one or more cats. All the little annoyances and messes (already nothing when compared with a dog) will totally evaporate once your cat sleeps next to you and gives you the honor of allowing you to leave your hand on her tummy.<br /><br />Thank you, Ms. Surovec, for a lovely book. I will keep it with my favorites for a lift when I feel a little blue.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Sleek and functional. Has everything you need and nothing you don't. Scroll through pages, last page recommended apps, but no pop-up adverts.
B0000DZEE3|3.0|It was good to see them all healthy and playing well together again!  The audio and video was very good.  The gig could have been better.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|When the game works, it's awesome. Good graphics, very easy to learn and play. However, the kindle version has some problems. When the game loads, half the time it restarts and you're stuck waiting for another two minutes. It freezes frequently, and it managed  to delete all my data, so I had to start over after reaching level 20. After getting more then six animals, I noticed  a significant amount of lag in the graphics and sound, which usually leads to freezing and restarting. I would recommend  this only if you're patient and don't mind losing a your data once in a while.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a good book.  Liked the characters and kept coming back to it until it was finished.  Would  chose<br />this author again.  Would recommend this to mature readers.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very relaxing.....the games can be very challenging but the music calms the brain.  I enjoy playing this game after a hard day at the lab.
0143038583|4.0|A very inside, in depth piece of writing. I had to get this for my college reading class but I would recommend this to anyone.
B00EO10M54|5.0|This Album is packed with hits it's so different from any other albums you never know what's coming next, I think it's based on the relationship with Actor Liam Hemsworth it's like a story from start to the end. I really like this Album and it's Miley's best so far.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|King - what the heck is going on?  About 50% of the way in I started dreading the fact that I had to read more.  Sometimes I'll just dump a turd of a book, but I set myself on finishing this one.  I think I got to the point where I really just wanted to see how bad it could get.  By 60%, I was really disturbed.  By 70% of the way through I knew the book was past redemption.<br /><br />Before I pleasure you (or myself) with brilliant analysis, a brief note and a spoiler... well, this whole review is pretty much a spoiler...  I find that internal consistency is very important in any fiction novel. Internal consistency.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that a book can be fiction, but it must be consistent with itself.  Fiction is not a blank check that allows one to create a world and then flip things on their head just because it is \\"fiction.\\"  A work of fiction creates a universe, but that universe still has its own laws.  For example, in 11/22/63 we accept the notion of time travel and everything that goes along with it.  King creates the ground rules and we accept them because the entire premise of the book is built around them.  Changing the past changes the future... the butterfly effect... etc.  HOWEVER, saving Kennedy does not cause earthquakes.  This is just random BS.  It adds nothing to the book whatsoever.  It serves no purpose whatsoever.  There is no logical explanation that is consistent with the book.  Yes, I know they come up the \\"Strings\\" and all that, but it is nonsense.  Causing earthquakes destroys the internal consistency of the universe King creates.  It creates a \\"come on... really?\\" moment for readers that might have otherwise been captivated by the book (although it is hard to see how anyone can get past 100's of pages of the most boring time traveler ever)..<br /><br />Regardless, if you want to read a book about NOTHING happening, read this book.  The book is 866 pages long.  I submit that at least 500 pages are a total waste.  An inexplicable train wreck of boring jobs, boring characters, boring people, and boring dialogue.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that this book was written in at least two parts... probably separated by a number of years.  How do I know that?  Because I have a sixth sense about this stuff.  You know how Neo can see the lines of the Matrix?  Yeah - I'm like that.<br /><br />The first part, which involved George/Jake saving his janitor friend from his murderous father, reads like the old (young) Stephen King.  However, as soon as that part of the story ends and George/Jake moves on Oswald, the whole tenor changes.  It is like a completely different book.  Devoid of all life.  Devoid of meaning.  Devoid of any hope that the boredom would end!!!  Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!<br /><br />George is the most boring time traveler ever.  This dude goes back in time and does what?  He spends a couple years teaching high school and dating another teacher?  He directs the school play?  Would it be possible to go back in time 50 years and be any more boring than this guy?  Maybe he could have joined a Bridge club too...<br /><br />If you went back in time 50 years to stop Oswald, is this how you would act?  Is his what you would do?  Is this how you would pass the time?  As a reader, do you expect something to actually happen in a book every once in awhile?  I swear that at least half of this book is taken up by nothing.  I thought I was reading Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Here... let me throw out a better plot for you.  Rather than \\"George\\" going back in time and being lame, how about he goes back and decides to be awesome?  Maybe he makes a bunch of money gambling.  Maybe he uses his knowledge of the future in some interesting ways.  Maybe he gets a little bored and decides to tinker with some other events.  Maybe he goes off the deep end and has to get himself straight just in time to complete his mission.  Wouldn't that story be more interesting?  Wouldn't that capture your attention more than maybe hegoes back in time, becomes a school teacher, and directs a school play?<br /><br />The thing about going back in time is that the events apparently re-set every time you do it.  If you change something one time... like save a life... you have to do it again the next time because you always start at the same spot.  Soooooo... If you were the author, wouldn't you have George do some crazy things and then hit the reset so it was like it never happened?  No matter how long he is gone, it is only 2 minutes in the present, so he could go through the exercise several times before starting the real deal.  It would be sort of like that movie groundhog day.  Perhaps he robs a bank and then does a reset.  Perhaps he makes a wad of money gambling and then does a reset so someone doesn't come after him.  Money can be taken back to the present time and returned to the past again.  I don't know, there are many possibilities.<br /><br />Speaking of money, what's the big problem with gambling anyway?  Can someone explain this to me?  He goes back in time with the knowledge of who will win.  You know - like Back to the Future.  However, it is apparently virtually impossible to win at gambling without someone trying to kill you.  Every time he wins he ends up on a list to get beaten or killed... and every person taking bets apparently knows every other person taking bets.  Again... totally ridiculous.<br /><br />Also, why does George have to wait to kill Oswald anyway?  Why?  Why not just kill him right away and get on with it?  Yeah...yeah...yeah... there is this lame plot idea that George must actually make sure Oswald does it.  Hey - I've got a better idea.  How about just shooting the guy in the face and then going forward in time again to see if it worked?  That way you wouldn't have to wait around for a couple extra years.  Just blow out the back of his head and see if it works.  If it does, great.  If it doesn't... well... go back and figure it out again.<br /><br />Let's discuss the final confrontation with Oswald.  Think about this - George/Jake goes back in time and has YEARS to plan.  He also knows that the past is fighting against him and that the greater the change the more it will fight.  George/Jake knows where Oswald will be and when he will be there.  So what is his plan?  After years of time to plan and an expectation that \\"the past\\" is going to fight him at ever step.  What is his plan?  He decides to grab his gun and travel to the book depository on the morning of the shooting - barely making it of course.  That's the big plan.  Now if you were in that position... and you knew that the past would give you trouble along the way... wouldn't you perhaps try to get there a bit early?  Perhaps sneak in the day before and spend the night?  Maybe plant a trap for Oswald?  I don't know... maybe do just about anything other than leaving the morning of the event as if you are simply traveling to a routine sports event or something?  Does this make any sense at all?<br /><br />So I once again find myself having to induct a Stephen King book into The Hall of Suck.  How is this possible?  Wait... why am I asking questions?  I'm omniscient and know all the answers!  So back up a minute... I'll tell you why.  Because genius most often occurs in the young.  Some of the greatest thinkers in world history reached their peaks prior to 30.  Therefore, I suspect King is feeding off the brilliance of his earlier material by digging up old stories and finishing them in the present.  For example, Under the Dome. Unfortunately, the same old magic doesn't work anymore.  The magic wand has run dry.<br /><br />There is also another reason... the taint of politics.  At some point in the last 10-15 years, it appears to me that King became infected with a political disease.  It seeps into his writing and ruins it.  It permeates.  It infests.  Look at Under the Dome and 11/22/63.  What is the common denominator?  King drags politics into each book.  He can't help himself. He can't just write anymore, he has to slip in political messages... sometimes implied, sometimes right in your face.  And yes, I realize that 11/22/63 is about the assassination of a President so \\"politics\\" will be discussed.  That's not what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Therefore, 11/22/63 must be inducted into the Hall of Suck!<br /><br />Let the ceremony begin!!!<br /><br />(trumpets)<br /><br />Hear ye, hear ye!

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was a bit entertaining but the story line was in a nutshell:  The new Robin Hoods using magic this time with pitting the rich against the poor.  Oh, but aren't movie actors making immense salaries?  The usual hypocrisy.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|One of my groupies asked for a review of Star Trek - Into Darkness.  I had it on my watch list anyway, so I figured what the heck.  Rock stars sometimes take requests... so I might as well too.  The first 10 minutes are some of the most nonsensical in the history of film.  The film starts out with the crew of the Enterprise attempting to save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano.  Kirk and Bones are running through the woods being chased by the natives while Spock is being lowered into the volcano with a device to stop the eruption.  Apparently Kirk and Bones have stolen a holy relic from the natives in order to provide a distraction so that the natives won't see a shuttlecraft fly into the cloud above the volcano.  On the other hand, Kirk tells the shuttle that the &#34;locals are out of the kill zone... you're clear...&#34;  What does that mean?  Out of the kill zone of the volcano?  That seems pretty stupid if you think about it considering that there is no way that they are out of the kill zone of the volcano.  The only other option would be that Kirk is referring to the &#34;kill zone&#34; of the device they are putting in the volcano to stop it.  Well that seems stupid too because, as we see, the device goes off but it does not affect the area surrounding the volcano.  Sooooo... I don't get it.  Also, why does Spock have to lower the device into the volcano?  For the sake of argument, let's say that the eruption and/or magnetic field interferes with transporters.  Ok... then put the device in a torpedo and shoot it into the volcano.  Why do they need Spock to ride down and do it?  Also, this isn't exactly a technical job.  Spock just has to flip some switches on the device.  Does that device appear to be so complicated that only Spock can figure it out?  Why not send down a red-shirted guy to do the job?  For that matter, why not just drop it out the shuttlecraft door and take off?  But what really gets my goat is the location of the Enterprise.Why is the Enterprise hidden under water?  It is a &#34;Starship&#34; right?  What possible reason could there be to hide it under water?  Even Scotty says, &#34;do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to hide a starship at the bottom of the ocean?&#34;  Actually yes, I do know how ridiculous it is. Typically, the Enterprise would be in orbit and the shuttlecraft would descend to the planet's surface.  Sooooo... exactly what decision making process generated the conclusion that the best way to hide the Enterprise from the natives was to enter the atmosphere of the planet and drop the ship into the ocean like a giant submarine?  How is that a good idea?  Is there ANY reason why that would be necessary?  ANY?  Never mind the fact that having the Enterprise fly around inside a planet's atmosphere is ridiculous to begin with.  Since when has the Enterprise been capable of entering a planet's atmosphere?  Maybe in the next Star Wars films we will see Imperial Star Destroyers flying around inside a planet's atmosphere as well.  Yeah, that would be stupid... and so is this.  Seriously - stop for just a minute and think about this.  Assuming the Enterprise was in orbit at some point (because that is typically where one would find a starship), what could have possibly lead the crew to the conclusion that taking the ship into the atmosphere and plunging into the ocean was a good idea?  Huh?  What would possibly be gained by that?  Remember the &#34;Prime Directive?&#34;  How does flying a starship into the atmosphere help hide it from the native population?  Wouldn't that be easier if you stayed in orbit?  Ok fine... so the Enterprise is under the water.  So if you want to make a special effects statement by doing something like that, then do it better.  Recall in the original Star Trek films the majesty of the Enterprise?  How the movies go out of their way to showcase the ship?  Is that what you see here?  When the ship rises out of the ocean, the effects are terrible.  Recall how the Enterprise looked in The Wrath of Khan when it rose up out of the nebula cloud?  How does that compare to the ship rising out of the ocean?  It doesn't.  Instead, we have a bunch of CGI nonsense ... then the view is blocked by a bunch of red trees... then `boom' the ship is flying across the sky toward the volcano.  Maybe I'd forgive the stupidity of having the ship under water if they at least made it look awesome when it came out.  Nope.  However, I must point out what Sulu says prior to the ship rising out of the water to rescue Spock.  Sulu says &#34;I don't know that we can maintain that kind of altitude.&#34;  What!  What are you talking about?  This is a starship.  What do you mean you can't &#34;maintain that kind of altitude.&#34;  What kind of altitude are we talking about?  I watched this scene over and over and it makes zero sense.  What about the Prime Directive?  Spock doesn't want Kirk to save him because it would allow the natives to see the ship (again - why under water in the first place?) and violate the Prime Directive.  However, according to Admiral Pike, stopping the volcano also violates the Prime Directive.  Pike tells Kirk &#34;You were supposed to survey a planet, not alter its destiny.&#34;  So what is Spock concerned about?  He is already violating the Prime Directive.  Is he ok violating it one way but not another?  Whew.... And that was just the first 10 minutes!  Since I had to practically write a book just to review the first 10 minutes, I can't continue that for the rest of the film.  I can, however, highlight some of the other low points:  -Distance transporting - does this make any sense at all?  If this were truly possible, then there would really be no reason for star fleet.  Who needs ships?  Everyone can just transport themselves anywhere.  -And speaking of long distant transporters, why exactly does Khan transport himself to Kronos, the Klingon world?  Why?  To escape the Federation?  Isn't there anywhere else hecould go?  If I was Khan I'd transport myself to that new militaristic starship that the Federation built and take it over.  Why doesn't he do that?  Apparently he helped build and/or design the darn thing.  -When the Enterprise arrives near Kronos, why does Kirk announce to Khan that he has arrived and is going to torpedo him unless he surrenders?  I thought the idea was to capture Khan, not give him a heads up you were arriving.  Maybe a sneak attack would be in order?  Well... I take that back... I guess the original idea was to shoot 72 torpedoes at him.  -Is it just me or is the whole idea here to make Khan into Osama bin Laden?  - Super cell phones - when did The Federation invent super-interstellar cell phones?  How exactly is it that Kirk can make a personal call to Scotty half way across the galaxy?  -When Scotty resigns, why is Chekov made head of engineering?  Do they not have a #2 guy?  They have to take a pilot or weapons officer from the bridge and make him head of engineering?  -What are the Klingons doing while the Enterprise sits there?  Can't they detect it?  -Of all the places to hide people, why would Khan put them into torpedoes?  Yeah, I get he was working on weapons.  However, if you are trying to save people I'm thinking sticking them in a loaded torpedo might not be the best choice.  -What exactly does the big, bad Dreadnought starship look like?  The effects are terrible.  You never really get a good look at it.  And why are the space battle effects so awful?  Watch Wrath of Khan and then watch Into Darkness.  Which battle looks better?  Yeah - Wrath of Khan.  Oh... and what is that admiral dude doing while Kirk and Spock figure out how to shoot through space?  Did he take a coffee break or something?  -When Khan and Spock go through logic of surrendering and returning Khan's crew to him, they play a logic game going through step by step.  Ahhhh... wouldn't part of that discussion be whether Spock would remove the bodies and arm the torpedoes?  If Khan was so brilliant, why didn't he think of that?  They are... after all... torpedoes.  -Was the death scene emotional?  Did you really care?  Again, compare to the same scene in Wrath of Khan.  Which is better?  -When Scotty sabotages the Dreadnought ship, where is the rest of the crew?  Recall that when he enters the ship they are bringing what appears to be a full crew on board.  So where is everyone when he is running around? Why does the ship look deserted?  Still, I give the movie 2 stars.  UPDATE 10/14/2016 - Did you note the comment I made about Imperials Star Destroyers above?  Well, I just watched a trailer for Rogue one and saw a Star Destroyer of some sort hovering over a small mountain... in the atmosphere... I'm becoming convinced that I can't think of anything too stupid anymore.  Eventually it will happen.
140006922X|1.0|I am a Christian and was looking for a book about the historical life and times of Jesus Christ.  However, this book may be largely factual about the political scene (maybe).  I felt the introduction(s) were misleading, self-serving by the author, and too wordy before getting to the actual book.  BTW, I will also not read Bill O'Reilly's supposed historical Jesus and His death.  I am a life long Christian, Catholic.  I found I could not finish this book because of the blasphemy:  The author does not know there is one absolute truth in all of creation:  Jesus Christ was always God--The Alpha and The Omega.  It is impossible to separate the Man and God in Christ.  He is One.  The concept of historical Jesus is fine, but it is against all Christianity to write about Him as Man only.  This book could have been written with observations of His extraordinary miracles but without personal opinion--thus keep it historical. Secondly, this book presents the Divinely inspired Holy Scripture as written about through an un-believers's eyes.  To say the Bible is a fairy tale or poetry, is abhorrent and these themes are carried out throughout this book.  I cannot recommend this book.  You, dear author, are a spreader of falsehood and you will have to answer to our Lord one day.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This speakerphone connects easily, sounds great, and transmits very little road noise to the caller. If you have an older style phone with built in voice dial - or are only looking to receive calls while driving, then this would be a great choice and is a good value for the money.<br />However if you have an android phone that only relies on google voice then you may have trouble placing calls as some phones will not respond to the buttons for outgoing calls. I would recommend testing your phone with a friends headset or speakerphone first.<br />My new LG smartphone wouldn't work with this and I had to upgrade to a Parrot MiniKit speakerphone, which has it's own built in voice command - something my phone and the Supertooth Buddy were lacking.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|heard so much about this show watched one episode on demand was hooked had to buy complete program . When it came i watched the complete series in one sitting now I am thinking about buying the second season ( but reviews are not that good ) can't make up my mind
B009RX7IX8|5.0|As with all the other Castle series, this one is GREAT! They just seem to get better and better! I would highly recommend this season. I just love how one season flows into the next. I have all the seasons and my family and I thoroughly enjoy watching them over and over! As to the quick delivery.....I am usually very pleased with Amazon's speedy delivery!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Absolutely fantastic program... I am patiently waiting for season 3!!! The program is well written and it has a great twist to the original Sherlock!!
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|Very limited widgets. Basic UI. Location requires GPS. Doesn't use standard android settings button. Wood grain background isn't as refined as similar apps.
B006BFK5DK|2.0|This is not classic EWF, just seem be be something thrown together . fooling the general public to think it's like old times .
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Other reviews are on target when it comes to this dvd.  If you lare a Michael Jackson fan, you will enjoy this.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is my movie!  I don't care how many times I've watched this,  he's one of a kind.  Matthew you are sooo sexy!!!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This book reinforced what I already knew about the Universe.  I will keep this book as a reference for the experiments.  They were fun and truly made the book interesting and engaging. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the law of attraction and how it works.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is a great book...super quick read and generally really creepy.  But not in a horror movie way.  I won't watch horror movies and refuse to watch anything CSI or NCIS.  So for someone looking for suspense and a great Gillian Flynn twist, this is an excellent choice.
B00DHHWXYY|3.0|good movie but has lots of confusing and slow parts. drags on during the middle. an alcohol soaked adventure of a notorious man and his relationships.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was super skeptical about reading this book, but ended up really liking it.  It definitely tugs at your heartstrings and forces you to think differently about a very real situation many families battle.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book. it was a page turner and I can't wait to read another of her books! I especially loved the epilogue
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved Edward and Bella<br />Together forever now<br />With renessmee and Jacob and every one will me happy now forever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. It's challenging while fun.I think that subway suffers should have more countries to travel in this game.!!!!
0143124544|4.0|Can't put this book down! Moyes does a great job bringing her characters to life, allowing you to become emotionally connected during their journey of lifes up's and downs. This book will stay with you long after you're done reading!
B008RV5K5E|2.0|I rented this movie through my Xbox a little while ago. And although it is a good movie and worth watching. It doesnt FEEL like any true style of Batman. Now, I know that in several comic books way back in the day, batman did actually use hand guns when fighting crime. But, the newer versions are a lot better where he uses the gadgets and other non lethal items to take down criminals. All and all... Worth renting.... NOT worth owning
B0091REZMW|5.0|When I first started playing this game I thought, oh great another facebook type game.<br />But now I am totally addicted.  It is not hard to level up and get the things you need if you work at it.<br />I have not spent any of my own money, just use what I receive from leveling up.<br />I could see how someone could spend a lot of money buying gems if they are not patient to wait for leveling or gifting.<br />I am now a level 52 and have 100+ friends and unlike on facebook I don't have to any interaction with these friends except the game.<br /><br />I play almost every night....This is how I now unwind from a long day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is for the thugs out there.i justvwann  say i didnt choose the thug like the thug life choose me
B008K9SG9K|3.0|The tracts are very different and diverse. Have mixed views. Some good and some didn't  like so much. For me too much contrast.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A great show that is now a favorite!  Im so glad I was able to catch up on past seasons here on Amazon!
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Easy listening with catchy tunes. Would recommend to all ages. Talented musician . Hope he does more similar stuff.<br />Cheers
1576754227|4.0|Its funny how I know all this stuff in the book. I dont procrastinate at all but people told me to try the book out and sure enough I did learn some new understanding of how things work better. I like the &#34;homework&#34; it gives you to work on.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game.  I enjoy the puzzles and the graphics are very nice. I find it a pleasure to play.  Good job guys!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|KISS is what is necessary for a new trader to survive in the markets.  Although I haven't followed these rules yet, it seems perfect for the beginning trader.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The &quot;gift&quot; boxes and other bells and whistles are just dumb. I just want the weather. The weather info itself is good, but the all the other junk gets in the way.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|This game is a delight!  I was so tired of ghosts and spiders....this game is pretty!  There aren't any HO but that was OK...you have to use your brain to play this game.  It was super fun!  I didn't have any trouble with downloading or playing.  Most of the puzzles are very clever. I recommend it!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I loved this book!! It was easy to read and kept me drawn into it the entire time.  It made you feel like you were right there with him! May God bless all of our soldiers for these things they go through on an every day basis.  Love this book!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This movie was okay.  There were some good laughs and it was nice to see them come together towards the end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have put of reading this series for many years after hearing the subject was Master/Slave sex things.  Boy am I glad I read this book.  There is a lot of sex things in the book but, it is written from the emotion of it, not the sex.  What a fabulous trilogy!! I will read this again, no question!!! I also read the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day - same thing but, different enough to be fresh and great!  You won't regret reading this trilogy!!! LOVE it!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Again Mr. King has wove a story full of all the dark things that had us reading The Shining to begin with.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Life lessons read it it is amazing. Read it read it it is very emotional like sad happy mad you get it...
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The DVD arrived earlier than expected in fine condition.  It is a suprisingly good film, one that has several layers of meaning.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I've always liked these slip type cases and after I switched from an iPhone 4S to a 5, I spent a lot of time looking for a new one. This one is absolutely perfect for my needs. Made from good leather and well put together, this fits my phone like a glove. Yes, it's very 'snugg' :-) The pull tab takes a few goes to get used to, but I love it. I feel my phone would be well protected if I dropped it. If you are one of the people who likes to keep their iPhone 'naked', I definitely recommend this case.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I've been waiting all year to see this.  No disappointment here, and the best way for me is at home, so Amazon Prime works great!
B00000633N|4.0|Sometimes credited as the \\"kiss of death\\" to the PSB's popularity in the States, mainly to do with the fact that it contained dance mixes and reworking's of songs when the States wanted the more recognizable single versions, and for the supposed 'homoerotic' content of the Domino Dancing video, this is actually a great album. Cotnains some classic songs, including \\"Left to My Own Devices\\" which sounded like some crazy combination of all of the songs they had recorded to date, and the bonkers \\"I Want a Dog\\" which remains one of my favorite PSB songs. In my view, it slips a bit with \\"It's Alright\\", which I much preferred in the single version, but each to their own, eh?<br />Classic PSB stuff which still sounds relevant today.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I'm not very picky about movies, and I believe Leonardo DiCaprio is now an excellent actor and knows how to pick his movies. Most of the movies I've seen in which he works in are very good movies.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Jeez, this is not a typical Spielberg film and it's very hard to watch. However, you SHOULD watch it, if only to understand what the world was like for out parents and grandparents. This is filmmaking at it's best. Compelling, a learning experience, and life altering. Watch this and learn something. It's a great film.
0316078913|5.0|I have read several of David Sedaris' books and he always sees ordinary happenings in such an amusing light. In this book, I especially loved the story &#34;6 to 8 Black Men&#34; Great read!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I hate Coldplay, I really do. Sorry Coldplay fans, but I'm entitled to my opinion.<br />However, I really like this album, so go figure. In my opinion, it's more 'pop' music than their earlier stuff and perhaps displays a bit more lightness than their earlier work which I found could be a bit dull, and sometimes pretentious.<br />I don't think I wish to analyze it more than that, but this is actually pretty good stuff. Still hate the title though, it sounds like something the Police might have used in the 80's :-)
B000IOM1YQ|5.0|Excellent Alan Parsons. My collection is now complete. Brings back better memories of the early music of the 1980's. Not big hair
B001O304UI|5.0|This is a beautiful album. It's warm, happy, sad, funny in places and contains the sublime \\"Being Boring\\", my favorite PSB track. Don't expect much in the way of dance numbers (apart from maybe \\"So Hard\\", but do expect a group at the peak of their prowess, writing wonderful, memorable and completely lovely songs. An essential purchase, and not just for fans of the group.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game love it<br />Easy play but not to easy<br />It is a must have game for all age groups
B00DP8XSQ2|2.0|I was looking for a program that would show what was in the sky as I was looking at it. This one does not, and while it has a lot of information, it requires me to scroll to try and match what I am looking at.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|So happy it didn't suck! Felt required to read since The Shining was such a fav...couldn't wait to finish......thank you mr king.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fantastic vocal performances.  If you like a capella, The Sing Off, mashups, and recent pop you'll LOVE this movie.  If you like most of those things you probably still really like it.  The character arc is ok, and the comedy is not bad and in places is hilarious.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|JT def brought R&B/Pop music back with this album. In Frank Ocean's words...the best song wasn't the single or singles in this case. The best song on this album is &#34;That Girl&#34;. A lot of the songs have outros towards the end of it...something like a instrumental.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I ordered these for my grandsons 13th birthday. I didn't think I could affords them until I saw the price here, and he was thrilled, since he wasn't expecting to get them. It got this proud grandma a great big hug and thank you!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very cool game I love o<br /><br />Open great multiple times and the world is a good block<br />World so I downloaded it
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|I'm just goin to save my time &amp; energy on this one! Thank u reviewers for the time u post even negative reviews....I trust the majority opinion.<br />I'll just stick with my free accu - weather app on my cell!

0679729895|5.0|You'd think the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the BFG wouldn't have such a sinister taste of humor, but you'd be wrong. This collection of stories by Roald Dahl is wonderfully disturbing
B008JFUQ16|5.0|Way better than the first one i'm buying 2 for Christmas presents. The people that are complaining that the story sucks are to old to realize this is a kids movie. I'm 27 and took my son to see this and I was cracking up myself at some parts.
B00DQVST76|4.0|This was a itmes that I was looking for.<br />I hope, I'll be able to find more items like this.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Really good game. Great graphics and addictive! Energy restores quickly which is good.good game for the kids too. They like completing the challenges.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's very addicting and lots of fun :) And you don't even get mad when you have to restart because the level lay outs always change. So no matter how many times you mess up it'd a thrill :) GREAT GAME!
0060987464|3.0|Most of this book if just difficult to read because of so many disgusting acts and I am no angel. If you are into absolute carnage and to a degree degradation or women then this is your book, however he does tie a lot of it in at the end of the book and I thought that was the best part.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just as great as the first book! Could not put it down. I would  recommend it without doubt! Fixing o download book three and pray she writes more. Can't wait for the movie next year..........
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is great for adults and children. Damon's Reef is a great game to help my grand children with their math and reading and to use their own mind on their own. This game is just great fun for all ages !
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Unreal picture quality for the 3D Blu-Ray.  The price at amazon makes even better.  I highly recommend this movie as well
1400069289|3.0|I thought the book was okay. Few parts were interesting. There are some books I rave about; this definitely is not one of them.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Installed everywhere I needed. A slick note store - really helped me get all of the clutter out of my head! Yo can see it all everywhere.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Unfortunately this was the last season. I loved this show and I will for sure miss it. I enjoyed every minute. And the end was just perfect. All GG fans need to see the last 10 shows.
B00DYEBM3I|4.0|Don't buy the vinyl pressing of this record. It's a little defective.<br /><br />When Portishead released Third after a decade-long hiatus, their album began with a slow, propulsive, menacing build-up. David Bowie's The Next Day started with a rushing, frantic disco-rock title track. All of these comeback albums start with a self-awareness, as if to say: &#34;Yeah, we know, it's been too long.&#34; Mazzy Star, on the other hand, starts their comeback album as if there was never a 17-year break after Among My Swan at all, and their new album, Seasons Of Your Day, proceeds accordingly. Recorded sporadically between 1997 and 2012, Mazzy Star's long-awaited follow-up doesn't reinvent the band's sound as much as it re-establishes it.<br /><br />When we last heard from Mazzy Star, Hope Sandoval and David Roback were crafting tunes that were as comfortable as a fleece sweater, and just as warm. Their brand of alternative folk incorporated elements of psychedelia and (what's now referred to as) dream pop. The same sound returns on Seasons Of Your Day, and at its best, the band is able to rekindle the slowburning fires that were alive and well on their other three albums. Sandoval's voice sounds just as good as ever, though she sounds even more timid than usual on this record.<br /><br />Seasons Of Your Day carries a pretty big problem with it, though. When Mazzy Star first arrived in the mid 1990's, what they were doing was new and inventive. Their sound now isn't quite as interesting this time around, but that's not their fault, per se, because Sandoval and Roback are just doing what they've always been doing. The unfortunate aspect of this is that now that there are tons of alternative folk acts out there, offering a lot of the same sounds, there's not a lot to distinguish this once-unique band from their contemporary peers. Over the decade-plus hiatus, Mazzy Star didn't learn from some of the mistakes that this genre easily falls into: repetitive sounds/tempos, the use melodies that are too spacey to really be captivating.<br /><br />Whether it be a function of the changing times or something that was lost in the 17-year interim, but Mazzy Star just isn't as breathtaking as they once were. It's much harder to get &#34;lost&#34; in some of these songs, and in most cases, you have to allow yourself to do so. Compare this with 1993's So Tonight That I Might See, where songs like the title track draw you in, whether you like it or not. The closest Seasons Of Your Day comes is &#34;Flying Low&#34;, an 8-minute closer that slowly brings in whatever instrument Roback finds lying around the recording studio. David Roback has hinted that several album's worth of material was recorded during the process of writing Seasons Of Your Day -- it's a strange thought because this album feels like a B-Sides collection. The songs are good, the sound is the same, but the gravity, immediacy, and atmosphere were lost somewhere along the way here.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />&#34;Flying Low&#34;<br />&#34;California&#34;<br />&#34;Sparrow&#34;elodies that are too spacey to really be captivating.<br /><br />Whether it be a function of the changing times or something that was lost in the 17-year interim, but Mazzy Star just isn't as breathtaking as they once were.

B00FKE3H0G|4.0|I don't care about Miley's career, her stunts, her controversy. I bought this album because friends of mine (who were also genuinely surprised) couldn't stop talking about how good it is. Not all tracks are winners, I skipped two of them after the first 20 seconds or so. (The Britney one is my least favorite, but I'm not a fan of her either.) Otherwise, they were all pretty good. There's a pretty obvious shift from her bubblegum Party in the USA days, and it was a move in the right direction for me, personally. Understand this cd is heavily produced. Lots of noise to wash out the sophomoric singing... but it isn't terrible, and - I can't believe I'm actually saying this - is actually pretty great.
B00006AW2S|5.0|How did I miss this.  I grew up with the Stones.  (never had the vinyl)  This is great early material that should be in every rock 'n roll collection.  The remastered tracks are all good.  Some of the songs are not on later compilations.  It will get a lot of play when I am in that rock 'n roll mood.
B000000OU0|5.0|This is without a shadow of a doubt the best recorded live concert EVER! This is a must have item.

B007HUD6OS|5.0|Good book. This series of books are clean and the stories interesting. I will be looking for another very soon.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Like many avid Kay Scarpetta fans, I preordered this ebook as soon as I saw it was coming available.  With a paperback or a hardback, if you don't like the book, you can at least donate...to the library, hospice, senior high rise, burn it in your fire place, etc. With an ebook, each time you look at the list of purchased ebooks, there it is...taunting you for your stupidity, denigrating you for trusting that you would get another good Scarpetta thriller, laughing at you because you ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS E-BOOK for a lot of $. Then you made yourself read it all the way through, hoping beyond hope it would improve instead of further degrade.<br /><br />So, whats wrong with it?  EVERYTHING!  Kay's smarmy dialogue, her niece's bizarro character development, Kay's non existent husband and her seedy partner cum dufuss Marino.  Kay is agitated, emotional and dull for all of the book, especially when Lucy enters the picture. Her husband is so undeveloped as a character he doesn't even belong in story. The entire plot is dull, dull dull. I could go on but this book is not worth it. Its characters are so one dimensional it should be included with the Flat Stanley series. I have not read a Cornwell book since and will not ever read one again.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I like this app.  It is neat.  It is not too cumbersome with info you don't need.  Just kinda straightforward.  Another thing I like is the hour by hour.  In Mobile, Alabama you need that.  We have a saying ... Oh just hang around five minutes, it'll change.  The weather that is!  Lol

To this day I have listened to Patti LuPone's autobiography, David Sedaris' latest, and now Tina Fey's Bossypants.  I tried diane Keaton's audiobook but could not get through it.  That being said recommendations WELCOME.  On to the review of Ms Fey's book.  I went into it with no expectations of memoir vs short stories, and came out feeling like I had experienced a brilliant standup comedic performance.  A five hour and thirty-five minute performance on par with stand up performers like  Sandra Bernhard, chris Rock and Richard Pryor.  She was intriguing.  I could not wait to hear her next story, her next thought.  She was compelling and smart and very.very funny.  I have not watched Thirty Rock as I abhor Alec Baldwin as an actor, and was bummed that Rachel Dratch was dropped for a \\"prettier face\\", but  not knowing that show did not decrease my enjoyment and had sparked some interest in catching the re-runs.  My only wish is that Tina would have gone into detail about Rachel getting cut from the show, but maybe that would have been a downer.  So....LISTEN to it as opposed to reading it, and if you have any audiobooks that meet my specifications that you think I might enjoy please  let me know.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I bought it for my work to plug in to win7 machine and it works well. I cannot use mode conversion short key though i can program 3 modes and able to switch among 3 modes.<br />So program block of text and enter it by one click.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy the FlipPix games.  Although my favorites are the FlipPix Art puzzles, this game, Simple Pleasures, will join them.<br />I, too, would like more space between the brush and the hammer, but maybe that's part of the game to keep you on your toes.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|One of the best zombies I've seen in a long time. I love the new take on the a zombie world crisis and the way they adapted the book to an excited working Movie adaptation.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|I would probably read from this author again.  The book was sad, and had an unexpected ending. Good book club book.
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|I guess I was expecting too much out of this movie. It was a bit of a drag and boring at times.  I think character backgrounds were very vague, earth was deemed uninhabitable but didn't seem bad at all, it was still able to sustain life but whatever. It was still boring.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|An older wiser Stephen king draws on his own battles to weave a great yarn, all the expected king touches but dare I sat a mellowed king, sure the horror is there but it is more our own horrors and battles that he draws on here<br />Brilliant and a worthy follow up to the shining and it's landmark influence
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It was an exciting ride. Haven't had a feeling like that about a movie in a while. A mixture of 28 days later, I am legend, and some krumping, ha ha ha. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Good story line, performances, and effects.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|works great and is small enough to put anywhere
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this app, I been so use to carrying a 4\\" x 6\\" sketch pad in my left pocket that it has been second nature. But with a Kindle Fire HD or any another Tablet, it is another way to express yourself simpler! Great way to paint, draw and even save your drawings to a Album, they can also be Shared. So go and do lots of practicing of your favorite subjects, ideas and have fun!
B004LROUW2|4.0|As always Murakami's work makes you question the outlines of your world even as you immerse in his. Among his most engaging and dimensionalized characters.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|really wanted this to work. But it looses wifi connection. It says sorry but your wifi is off. tried to reset it and it says it cant connect. Callled customer service and  get \\"Oh you need to restart your router and computer and chromecast. so everytime I want to use the chromecast I have to do all that....... o.k. wasted 35 dollars.

B00ESNE696|5.0|The writers on this show never disappoint!  There is always a twist or two leading to another twist or two. . . . They have set up Season 5 for us--we will have to wait to see what happens. When I think I have it figured out, something unexpected happens.  The new twist with the NSA is a good commentary about what's going on with our phone and email conversations; you just never know who's listening and what will be interpreted!  Did Diane really rat out Will?  Is Alicia rethinking her decision (again!) to go with the others to the new firm?<br /><br />If you haven't been a rabid fan for the last 4 seasons, stream them or buy the complete seasons and get caught up!  We've been fans since the first season when a friend told us about the series!  We haven't missed a single episode since!  (Thank goodness for DVR!)  These writers are first class!
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|This a fun, entertaining adventure. Not too hard nor too easy. Good graphics, creepy villain, and a good story line.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Iron Man 3 was a great movie. The ending leaves you in suspense as to the future of Tony Stark (Iron Man) and his role with the Avengers.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This hit me hard.I started reading at the age of three. I dropped out of school in the eleventh grade to marry and I had two girls. I started college at 25,with a full scholarship,graduated in 1982.malala book made me ashamed of how I took my education for granted.she has already changed our world for the better.we love you,malala.how brave you are!!
0812550757|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, but it is undeniably slower paced than Ender's Game. It may be the case that this book doesn't appeal to the same genre of people that Ender's Game did, mainly I would suggest it for people who enjoy philosophy (specifically on how we should interact with other species) and mystery novels, as this is an excellent combination of the two.
B007QSNNUI|5.0|I purchased this book for my 17 year old son so he could discover his strengths and decide on a college major and a career.  However, when we received the \\"new\\" book, the online code had already been scratched off and used (there is a 177 question online test that is part of the book).  We had to pay $10 for a new code before he could take the test.  The seller apologized and gave us a $10 refund.  We found the summary of the strengths to be very useful, and the quick remediation of the problem a relief.  I would recommend this book and this seller.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I absolutely adore this book from the parts that made me laugh out loud to the profound statements that made me stop and think. It is light-hearted at parts and deep at others. I love how the character's stories are all intertwined; in the end not everything is as it seems; and how everything ends up. I do not want to say much more and give anything else away. This book is a wonderful treat.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|I ordered this for my husband because he heard the their music on the TV series Strike Back and wanted more of their music. He hardly ever likes a new group, but every song on this cd was fantastic. I truly loved it as well. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a mix of blues and rock.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I don't know why people are saying that this book is not that good I thought it was great loved it
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Cloud Atlas is the movie based on the book of the same title by British author, David Mitchell. To turn this marvellous, 500+ page novel into an almost 3 hour movie was indeed an ambitious project. There are some big names (Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry) who take on up to six roles, requiring, obviously, lots of makeup. The format is necessarily different from the book, so that each of the six stories runs through the movie from start to finish. As with the book the different genres are represented. While there are some significant departures from the book, the spirit and feel of the book are adhered to. Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry and Doona Bae are quite outstanding in all their roles. While the makers of the film take quite a bit of cinematic licence with the plots and feel compelled to include romance and lots of whiz-bang action, some of the changes allow the film to make sense without the viewer having read the book. Nonetheless, I am very glad I reread the book before seeing the movie, and I would recommend doing so if one is to gain the most from the movie. Impressive.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Although it takes gigantic batteries my son loves this mobile. I like how the leaves move up and down with the motion of the mobile. Only problem is that the volume only has two settings and the low is very quiet and hard to hear.
0375703764|2.0|Though it was said to be in &#34;very good&#34; condition and the seller seemed reputable according to reviews, the book IS NOT in any kind of good condition. This first page already fell out, there was damage to the front and back cover, AND there's some weird shmutz on the back that I can't scrape off. Don't waste your time, spend the extra money and get it new.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading these books! It ends just the way I wanted it to! I am going to re read them starting now!
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|The live dvd is awesome! Set list is geat. The 2 live cd's have some bonus tracks that I have never heard live before!  It is one of my top three dvd's of all time!  If you don't buy this you are missing out big time.  Thanks Kreator.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Really like this soundtrack! And the movie is good too.  That is how I discovered they actually had a CD.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|\\"Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song\\" is a solid follow-up to \\"Mission Bell\\". Amos is just getting better and better! I know that the love of music is a very subjective area and I don't claim to be a qualified critic. All I know is that I have immensely enjoyed listening to the songs on this album. I wasn't in love with Lee' earlier albums, but thought \\"Mission Bell\\" was very good. This newest release is the best yet in my opinion.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|It does what it is supposed to do and is the only weather app that I have found that is accurate for my specific location.

B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love playing this game!! It is so much fun. It's just like the FB farm games only u can play on the go. I love that u surf doesn't go bad, u aren't into the game &amp; then have 2 stop because u have no energy left 2 continue. U can also make baked goods, a better verity of trees &amp; animals. U can also buy a storage barn 2 store machines &amp; animals u don't need 2 use. ***Plz be aware that the Amazon App, Android App, &amp; FB version of this game are ALL different &amp; u will not have the same farm as u do on ur phone as on FB. U also don't get all the features &amp; goals on the Amazon App liked u will on the Android app.*** This is a BIG down fall as well as a disappointment that the Amazon App has so much less then the others. This SHOULD be fixed.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Good storytelling, good characters, interesting history.  Will look forward to next book in series.  Not a literary classic, but a good read nonetheless.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Idk why it won't let me log in and I tried EVERYTHING....ITS SO STUPID.....I EVEN TRIED SHUTTING MY DEVICE DOWN... AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS WANT ME TO KIK THEM... HAHA LOL
B000QCS8TW|3.0|If I did not love the TV show, I would not have made it through this book.  There are a lot of characters and some important things are just mentioned in passing.  I'm not sure I want to invest in the series since it takes the author 5 to 7 years to write one book.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This game has great graphics and sound effects.  It is very interesting and not too difficult.  Always love pirate games.
1442364203|2.0|This review is for the audio version only. I'm sure the actor who narrates it is a great actress, I understand she starred in The Kite Runner, but her reading makes it nearly intolerable. It sounds like it's coming across on a teleprompter and she in incapable of predicting what will come next in the sentence, and therefore pause accordingly.<br /><br />It is, as if the, commas are, all in the wrong, spot. I can barely stand it, but I have don't want to hear about the government shutdown and have a long commute. The story is compelling, I would recommend reading it if you have time.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|THIS IS A PERFECT COMBINATION OF CREEPY AND FUN AND IS A MUST HAVE FOR KIDS 10 AND UP FOR A GOOD MYSTERY BUT DON'T BOTHER WITH A FREE VERSION GET THE FULL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Maybe in two years, Google will all ANY media content to be stream.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I'm not a fan of giving reviews but this product is very good and it actually works. You must buy this item
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I would have considered myself a casual fan of Metallica before watching the movie Through The Never. The movie blew me away and so does this cd.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved almost all of this book.  One part I didn't like bit it would be a spoiler if I posted it.<br /><br />It's a good novel with a clever story.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love all his books. I would recommend it to all my friends.<br />I like the history he puts into his books. Just got the 2nd<br />book and have started it.

B004TACMZ8|1.0|Unfortunately,I bought this item at a woodworking show last year and not at Amazon or I would have definitely sent it back for a refund. I have tried it now on three occasions and it has not worked a single time. I have never had it find a single stud or ceiling joist! All I get are false positives and have a number of empty holes I've drilled to prove it. I have two or three of the Zircons and they at least work about half the time. This Bosch unit is complete junk.
0307476073|3.0|From all the reviews I read, I thought this would be different.  She is not a person I like and I found myself getting angry at her for her stupidity and lack of responsibility.
B009LDCXQQ|4.0|I like this series...wait, let me rephrase that...I LOVE this series.  That being said, this was not my favorite season, though it had its high points and the season finale had me watching in wonder.  Sam and Dean and their relationship is, of course, still the focus of the show and how can you not love Castiel, the fallen-unfallen-fallen-bad guy-wannabeGod-crazy-good guy angel.  I think Castiel is one of the best characters ever created in sci-fi/fantasy tv.  Of course, I could be biased there.  Just a little.<br /><br />I might have found the finale a tiny bit underwhelming, if not for the conclusion of the Scribe of God/Castiel plotline...and all of the potential this creates for the next season.  Watching those final moments of the last episode really got me right back into why I started watching \\"Supernatural\\" in the first place--the ability to awe based on emotional investment in the lives of Sam and Dean and Castiel and on the huge world-changing events that they end up embroiled in.  Heaven.  Hell.  Purgatory.  Earth.  I never knew at the end of the season where they stopped the End of the World where this show would go, and they keep on (generally) delivering...<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />I found some of the plot lines of Season 8 a bit boring, in particular how many flashback scenes we were subjected to re Sam and his girlfriend when he quit hunting after Dean was blasted into Purgatory.  I did like how he decided, much as Dean did, that the \\"normal\\" life was not for him in the end.  This was a nice bookend to Dean's similar realization, but I think they just dwelled on it a bit too much.<br /><br />In the first watching, I didn't like the friendship Dean had with Benny, the vampire he met in Purgatory and brought back with him, and the troubles it caused with Sam.  But upon a second watching, I realized that I liked Benny more than I had at first and that this friendship shows that, more than anything, Dean's experiences in Purgatory changed him, especially considering how he had reacted previously to Sam's friendship with a \\"monster.\\"<br /><br />Kevin is still a hoot and I enjoy seeing Garth, not a perfect replacement for Bobby by any means, but also an interesting character in his own right.  Plus, of course, seeing Charlie again is always wonderful; what a charming female addition to the show and I hope she appears in the next season, as well.<br /><br />Then we get into the meat of the show, with the Quest to close the gates of hell and the introduction of the Men of Letters...this kind of brings things full circle as we realize that the specialness of the Winchesters didn't just come down the bloodline of their mother, a Campbell, but from the Winchesters, as well.  I'm not yet sure what I think of their discovery of their own version of a \\"bat-cave\\" secret hideout, but I think that this show definitely needs some kind of Quest in each season...something that has been missing on occasion.<br /><br />This season may not have been perfect and certainly didn't high the high-high points like the Lucifer-Michael End of the World storyline...but this show is still good, still going, and I still like it.  Lots.  Can't wait to see the next season.
B0013JYSOQ|5.0|this is my favorite movie of all time. music is my life and this movie portrays it and its power and affect perfectly.
0380789035|5.0|American Gods is worth reading slowly simply to savor it a few more days. The story was refreshingly unexpected and well written.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Fast-paced and action packed, this is Star Trek for a new generation, hopefully one that didn't see &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34;.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is an AMAZING album!! Dream Theater has done it again. I love all the tracks on this cd but \\"Illumination Theory.\\" is a masterpiece one of the best songs I have ever heard. It takes you for a musical ride for 22:00 min.<br />Mike Mangini really shines on the album(Great playing).The sound of the album has been talked about alot.I love the In your face sound. I think it is a great sounding Album.I like the Japan version it has a better sound than the american version(I always get the japan copy for the sound of all the bands I love)!. Get this album It is Amazing.One of the best Dream Theater albums for sure.
031603441X|5.0|This book is hysterically funny in parts, moving, informative, philosophical.<br /><br />Keith's &#34;voice&#34; is delightful. I had no idea what he was really like. The guy is deep and he gets it, life that is.<br /><br />The stories he tells like the one about driving to morocco for drugs paints such a scene for the reader as to what Keith, those around him, and the world was like. Just reading about what his freaking car was like was worth that chapter!<br /><br />I<br /><br />And the story of the stones being pulled over in Arkansas after being warned never to drive around southern states and how they got out of that mess is vividly described and will make you laugh in amazement about what goes on behind the scenes or at least what the 60's were like.<br /><br />It's interesting to read about Keith and mick's relationship. And then the Canadian prime minister's wife being a stones' groupie and running around their hotel rooms.  Wow.<br /><br />The narrative is so rich and not a single page is slow.<br /><br />I love Keith now. I am so glad he opened up and now we get to know him and the history of that time period.<br /><br />I loved hearing about his parents, his schooling, how he met the stones and the Beatles and on and on.<br /><br />After i read it, I got the audio book. That is a hoot, especially the part keith reads himself!<br /><br />You have to read this book!
B00EO10M54|5.0|Are the people giving this album 1 star just listening to it once and just throwing it away? Listen to the album a few times. Let the lyrics and beats sink in. This is a GOOD album. I think the same people who gave this album 1 star didn't read up to see what they were even buying. They just bought it to ridicule it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Miley Cyrus' \\"Bangerz\\". I think Love Money Party and Maybe You're Right stood out to me. Maybe You're Right reminded me of her previous track Wrecking Ball. I think it is her response to her \\"change\\".<br />Love Money Party will be one joint I could listen to over and over and over again.<br /><br />Again, I recommend listening to this album a few times before determining whether its good or not. Good job Miley :)
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is one of 2Pac's best albums, and my personal favourite. While Me Against the World shows 'Pac at his most three dimensional and well rounded as an artist this is a West Side thrill ride from start to finish. While there are some filler tracks (Shorty Wanna Be A Thug, All About U, Run Tha Streetz, etc.) that you might not start a mix with on your iPod, if you sit and listen to the CD you won't be skipping over them. If you've listened to 2Pac before and you're interested in getting a CD then this is a good choice. That being said, if you've never really listened before and are just curious, Me Against the World might be a better starting point, especially if you're not as comfortable with the thug/gangsta content. Overall an amazing album, from start to finish.
0399165274|4.0|Its after a long time that I picked up a book by this author. The last I read was The Odessa File some 2 years back. I had almost forgotten what a fantastic author he is!<br /><br />The Kill List is about just what the title suggests - a list of people who are tracked and assassinated. This time it's an imam who has been placed on the list. `The Preacher' has made it his target to send out a message to the radical section of the society and carry out assassinations of people at high places and importance. It results in him being the next target on the kill list and our protagonist getting involved. Christopher Carson comes with a long list of accomplishments and is considered to be the perfect man for the job. However, tracking and killing a faceless person, no matter how famous or infamous is not an easy job, especially when The Preacher makes it personal and tries to rain down hell on Carson.<br /><br />Christopher Carson is a person you expect amazing things from. With his background, you believe that nothing may be impossible for him. But it is his dedication and operational actions that makes you really like him. Then there is The Preacher - a worthy opponent for Carson. I have always had trouble believing/understanding the `Virgins waiting in Paradise' concept of the Jihadists - how can any God not condemn the killing of innocent people? And so, I guess I was  in a bit anti-Preacher mode from the beginning, but as far as villains go - they all have twisted logic behind their actions and so I guess it may as well have been him. I also particularly liked the character of Ariel.<br /><br />The plot and the pace is in true Frederick Forsyth style that keeps you glued to the pages until the very end.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|With these two great actors I expected so much more!  I kept waiting for either of them to do something great and it just never happened.
B00EIMJVOM|5.0|Yes she is a pop star but she's a fan of R&B and you can definitely see the influence in some of her songs. The title track 'Alive' is just so special I can't even describe. The three that stuck out to me the most are 'Thunder', 'Breathe' and 'Gold'. After that it's hard to pick favorites because every song is great! No album fillers at all. If you like different genres of music then this is for you....there isn't one specific sound. If you're looking for another pop record then you'll miss out on a good album. I prefer this over Who You Are simply because you can hear and feel so much growth....she has definitely grown as a person and an artist and it's evident in this album. Every song has a story. She was so involved in every process of creating this album....the lyrics and vocals are just omg! Well done Jessie J
1452110581|5.0|This is a great funny read for any cat lover makes a great gift if they love cat books to read.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|This album is by far the most perfect expression of Verdi's music.  Kaufmann sings with passion and tragically as Verdi<br />music demands.  The best of the best is the Otello and Macbeth.  His range from bottom notes to top notes are outstanding and worthy of Verdi.  Verdi and Kaufmann a combination to live for.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|THis is a fun movie with a good point about how we need to save our natural resources, great family movie.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|I really enjoy watching Dex. Seems TV programing got into a slump lately, so the best answer in my case was to order the DVD set. Glad I did, now I can watch at my leisure when I please. The shipping was very swift, in fact, faster than some other items ordered. I'd do it again, which to me is saying a lot.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|THis is by the great Rocky for Disney Shake it Up It is a fun exciting cd that is a fun listen,
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I like the idea of bringing back the original Star Trek characters with different actors.  What I don't like is telling a story that's already been told.  The effects were awesome but taking Wrath of Kahn and having Kirk and Spock change spots in the death scene was lame.  If another Star Trek movie is to be done, Abrams needs to put more thought into the plot.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is an ok game that my daughter plays some times but not a ton.  It would be okay for kids.
1476727651|5.0|This was a great book, I enjoyed reading it.  Stephen King is great as always and love his first sequel.  Maybe it will be turned into a movie.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|This cd gets you up dancing.  Sang along and enjoy the fun music with the kids, and another disney star.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Perfect for reading on the go.  Can change orientation and size of fonts.  Better than my old kindle. Love the color.
B00A27X972|4.0|It was interesting.  It kept me wanting to pick it up and read more, so made for a fast read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of Stephen Kings top five books a true treat and delight to read I could not put it .
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam writes like I write...down to earth and to the point. She is real...like she is your best friend coming to have lunch with you. This book tells a story that has been told a million times before, like it's brand new. I can't wait to reap the benefits out there just waiting for me!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A pretty fun game, I like that it's not all h.o., but has other mini games in it too.<br />You go through energy really fast, but it renews even if you're not playing, . So it's not so bad.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Typical Marvel Film...which is a good thing. Proper mix of humor, interesting storyline, and action. Would definitely watch it again.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Beautiful music, a true blessing from God! She is truly gifted. Love that she can dance & play at the same time.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|No movie will ever be perfect (accept Avatar and Sixth Sense). This plot and setting were both pretty interesting. I wanted a little more explanation at the end but I still give this movie a weak four stars or a good three stars. I chose four because its actually pretty clean. I notice most Crusie movies spend time on developing plots and characters vs just raw action. I like that.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Though less expensive than the Apple TV, it also allows you to do significantly less.  For example, you cannot broadcast / mirror everything you are doing on your laptop or phone to the TV screen like you can between a macbook or iphone and the apple tv.  May be in the future Google opens it up to broadcast/mirror everything, but until then, definitely disappointed.
B000JMKRKC|1.0|This did not engage my interest at all.  Perhaps just a slow start, but I did not keep going.  I did not get past the first chapter.

B00AES0AZI|5.0|The charactors are so well written snd engage you immediately.  The dynamics between the dog and the beast draw you in and keep you wanting to know more.

B00395ZYVS|5.0|Enjoyed the novel and could relate to the peace that comes from acceptance and forgiveness.  All and all a wonderful story.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|When I first came across this book, I found the format interesting and in all honesty it's what caught my eye.<br /><br />Its amazing how well he wrote this book.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|Love the show. Wished it would come back to TV. Had some great actors. Kept me wanting to watch the next show.
B001JI72AI|5.0|This movie is excellent in many ways: the acting, the depiction of space travel, and most of all the illustration of how human actions contribute to both failure and success.  If this wasn't a true story, the plot might seem implausible!  Highly recommended.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is just what I needed simple and fast to operate. I like it very much its helpful for me

B00F4ID7JE|2.0|Sting's latest release (admittedly much anticipated) serves primarily as a self-indulgent artistic expression. As, such the audience/listener experience and response is relegated to the back seat (or perhaps unfortunately the trunk). I was repeatedly tempted to pre-order this album based on my decades long appreciation of Sting's work, but sadly I am very glad that I did not place that pre-order. I have tried numerous times now to re-engage with the music offered here, and have kept trying to convince myself to go ahead and order it... but just cant do it. There is a real disappointment factor that I just cannot get past: No next generation of Soul Cages, no epic new material reminiscent of Ten Summoner's Tales, not even more original soul/easy listening as in Sacred Love... just nothing here for me.  It is amazing though how many years I can just keep on listening to those aged yet still wonderful Sting albums of the past. C'est la vie!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|It's fine for a protective cover. Doesn't stand we'll when using the flap . I bought because of the price
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Well, it plays chess well, you can vary the levels.  This is a free version for your pad, I used this on my kindle fire and am happy with the game.  I've an average player.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Well done. Gets my favorite monsters, Zombies, and a neat romantic twist together. Well done. So 5 more words are required, okay is this enough?
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It is by far the best pirate tale, what more can be said, it is a clasic. Read it to your children.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Where are all these writers coming from. So many good post apocalyptic, in the future type movies are hitting the screens. I liked the plot and it was pretty neat the way everything fell in place. I started to figure it out before the plot was actually revealed, but that's okay.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Even though I had never heard of Julia Child before I came to the USA 22 years ago, I soon learned about her. Being interested in food and recipes, I bought both volumes of Mastering the Art of French Cooking as well as Julia Child's My Life in France, upon which half of this story is based. Although I saw Julie Powell's blog, I was not a regular reader; something put me off - maybe it was the self-absorption, the cuss words, or her hatred of Republicans. No matter! I nearly didn't buy this movie but my daughter suggested that I should. I am glad she did! Meryl Streep's portrayal of the joyful, boisterous Julia had me believing she really was Julia Child. Amy Adams as a cute-as-a-button Julie Powell was probably nicer than the real Julie, if review comments are to be believed. Most of all, though, I fell in love with both their warm, supportive husbands! Be warned that there are one or two earthy moments, and the odd swear word, but it did not spoil my enjoyment of this tale of two romances wrapped up in a foodie's delight.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I always loved Iron Man and R. Downey's ability to portray the character so well. Great action and of course some unbelievable scenes. Love the way the movie incorporates computer graphics and real actors.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Good entertainment, good job on reviving some of the original character's personalities especially Scotty. Special effects great but not over the top.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It is very much like sitting at the table except you don't have to sort edges and pick up when you are thru.  Good for senior citizens to keep mind active. Lots of hours passed before you know it. As you go for the higher challenges you are also challenging yourself. Thanks for having these. Enjoy at stay relaxed.
B00280LYIM|5.0|To:Rick Riordan<br /><br />I really like these books because I am interested in action,adventure,and science fiction.I like the fact that every book has an adventure or a quest.i am jealous about all the ballpoint pens,swords,and shields<br />(I don't dislike anything in all of your books)<br />I recommend reading this book because it is very interesting and great details that make movies in your head and is very specific<br /><br />To a fantastic author:Rick Riordan
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions I wish their were real  I like all the different levels in this game it's very fun game
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|Ray Bradbury has the singular capacity to create a claustrophobic atmosphere in the most expansive of all places. The Martian Chronicles is a must read for any lover of science fiction and rich literature that reveals only what the reader needs to know, shrouding much of Mars and Earth in dreadful mystery. There is a palpable sense of fear of the unknown that runs throughout this series of short stories. I loved the fact that it had such a fifties sci-fi feel, with shiny silver rockets and atomic warfare. It seems very representative of the time it was written, and transcends above much modern fantasy fiction.

B0058O84G0|4.0|Ken Follett pulls you into a historical period and immerses you in it. He does the research. All you have to do is sit back and read. In this book he conducts the reader through Britain, France, Russia, America and Germany during World War I, by way of aristocrats, Bolsheviks, brutal Tsarist police, Welsh coal miners and many others. The author summarises people and events in the course of dialogue concisely and effectively. The characters can be somewhat two-dimensional, and they tend to repeat from Follett's other books. The love scenes are almost comically formulaic, but I prefer them written that way within the context of this book. I also think Follett's books set in the Middle Ages are better. Still, I will definitely read the sequel to this book ... and the one after that.
159463176X|5.0|Best I've read in years.  Many reviewers have complained that the previous books were better and that the narrators were hard to understand.  Mountains is different from the first two books in that each chapter is a short story, from a separate personal perspective, but with very strong ties to all the other chapters.  In other words, each person tells a different part of the story.  This device is used in many traditional novels, in order to add interest.  The only difference is that it is used more here than normal, but definitely is not a collection of disjointed  short stories.  In fact, this adds a surprising amount of depth and character development to the book.  The themes in this book are more numerous, the tone more mature.  You will definitely feel the book more personally.  Some of the characters are modern persons, interacting with the third world characters.  Mr. Hosseini has the uncanny ability to touch you deeply, when you least expect it, and to uncover feelings in yourself, you thought were unrecognized. What you lose in the driving momentum of the previous books, you more than gain in richness.  The Kite Runner and Spendid Suns were so similar, it is a relief that this new book has shown an ability to diversify.  For me, this book is every bit as wonderful as the other books.  In fact these three book are my favorites of all time (I'm  55).  Please don't let a reviewer put you off this book.  We can only pray that the author has a long and productive career.  Regarding the narrators, they were a little difficult for me at first, but I never lost the thread of the story, and by the end of the book, I felt I had 3 new friends from the Middle East.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A decent book, it isn't a hot, steamy turn on for me. It does keep me interested and wanting to read more.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I suppose I was expecting something a little more in depth and entertaining but it was just a bunch of silliness.  Sorry I spent the money on it and will not buy another Ellen book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam takes you through the Universal Laws in a way that is practical and easy to understand. You don't have to have an advanced degree to grasp these concepts.<br />To boot, it's a really fun and enlightening book. I highly recommend it to everyone.

B005T87QCI|1.0|I got this game thinking it would be awesome, but it definitely did not meet my expectations. I really was disappointed. After a little while, literally everything costs money. Therefore, I highly suggest you do not get this game because like I titled this review, it's not worth it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app has been working fantastic for the last 2 months, now, since my devices are linked, i cant load ANY videos as all! Downloaded or not.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love these types of games.  My son and I could stop playing this game.  GreAt story line that keeps you coming back.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved this book more than I can possibly say, for so, so many different reasons. I mean...words cannot describe.<br /><br />This book focuses on a girl named Cather, a freshman in college who's obsessed with a book and movie series called, \\"Simon Snow,\\" (which is like a knock off of Harry Potter in layman's terms). She starts off college as a shut in, trying to keep everyone out of her life but her twin sister, who, ironically, actually wants to take a more independent route. Throughout her first year, Cather goes through a lot, with school, family, friends, and even love. All this goes on whilst she attempts to finish her insanely popular, novel sized fanfiction before the last book in the series comes out. That's basically the just of the book.<br /><br />When it comes to story, this book has it all. It has the main characters story going on, and that brings in her twin sisters story arch, and Rainbow has even managed to involve Simon Snow in it as well, scenes written well enough to make one think that they came directly out of a different book. There's even some fanfiction thrown in there from said series, written by Cather, which, somehow, feels like it really is written by her, instead of by Rainbow and through her.<br /><br />On terms of character, it's really very wonderful, because while everyone is developed right off the bat, they develop with the story and throughout Cathers year of college, which is fantastic to read. That fact becomes even better when you think of how Cather turns out in the end. She doesn't do a complete180 by the end, like many characters tend to do in teen novels, she just...grows up, and grows out of a lot of her anxiety issues, coming to terms with a lot of things in the end.<br /><br />You see what it's like to be a person like Cather, and that's really struck a chord with many fans of the book since so many of them, as it turns out, are very much like her. I think this book, in many aspects, will be a favorite and an inspiration to many readers to come, I know it will be for me.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell, it's quite a book you've written, and you make me so desperately want to write the Simon Snow series. If I ever become a novelist, and if I ever manage to cross paths with you as one, I hope we can at least joke about writing them in some corner of a Starbucks somewhere.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Highly recommended, I looked forward to reading it very evening after work.  The characters felt like real people and I was sorry when the book ended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN I CAN'T GET MYSELF OF OF IT I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE TEMPLE RUN AND SUBWAY SURFERS YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE LOVE LOVE LONE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|After reading this book, I wished I could have been a part of his circle of life.  How intellectually stimulating to have been a regular at the dinner parties that lasted for hours.  What a loss to a terrible disease.
B00973902K|5.0|I love this song. Although I didn't like the lyrics related to being willing to sell her soul for contact with a boy (How stupid is that?), in general I love this song and the high-vibe way that I feel after listening to it. Think #happy #inspired and #energized. If you love the sample, you will love this. PS. It is nice to listen to music on the Amazon Cloud, too. Happy listening~*
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is sooooo awesome! hardly any glitches and although it got ersed several times, its still pure epicness!!!<br />that is gratifying!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very limited application support and generally works okay. When streaming, the mobile device used to initiate the stream loses it's connection so you can't control video playback. Maybe a few more releases and it'll be ready for prime time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a while. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Loved it from cover to cover. It is one of those books that you continue to think about long after you have read the last word. Can't wait to recommend it to all of my book loving friends!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great and super easy to set up and use.  My only question is when is Amazon going to get it together and release an app so I can play Amazon Instant Video with my Chromecast?
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|While it's not nearly as good as M-G-M's classic Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz is still worth watching.  Fairuza Balk does a decent job of playing Dorothy.  The other characters in the movie are whimsical and loveable.  It's too bad it doesn't have songs sprinkled throughout to lighten the mood.  The special effects are wonderful at least.  They never should have shown the yellow brick road or the Emerald City in ruins--that was the biggest mistake.  Even the original books that the movie is based on didn't do that.  But despite its shortcomings, Return to Oz is still a worthwhile movie.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story is a refreshing change from the angsty, tear your soul out books that I have been drowning myself in lately.  Drew and Kate are entertaining and there are plenty of steamy sex scenes too.  Pure fun escapism at it's best.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|This is a movie Uncle Walt would have been proud of if he were still alive.  Unlike Disney's Return to Oz, which made a few mistakes along the yellow brick road, Oz the Great & Powerful stands out with successful ideas of original story telling that work.  Everyone in the cast gave great performances.  Michelle Williams was the perfect Glinda--even better than Billie Burke's version.  James Franco was very believable as Oscar Diggs and had just the right amount of charisma to pull off the part of a younger Wizard.  There's no denying that nobody can top Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Even so, Mila Kunis did a remarkable job of trying.  This is a movie that deserves to be called a classic.  It's too bad it wasn't a musical like the Disney M-G-M version.  But musicals are a dying breed--except for animated films.  The bottom line is that Oz the Great & Powerful deserves a lot more credit than some have given it.

0374533571|1.0|OH DAMN~ I hated this book personally as a lousy read and professionally as a psychotherapist and professor of psychology.  I reluctantly went to my book club this evening as this was the \\"chosen\\" book.  I expressed my disgust at the characterization of mentally ill as mentally challenged, the portrayal of Pat as being unable to reason or use anything beyond childish words (The Bad Place, Apart Time, not being able to calculate the amount of the restaurant bill and subsequently leaving \\"a tip Nikki would like/approve of\\"...About $35 for a $5 tab... I resented that there was no extant symptomatology that would indicate the necessity of a commitment into a \\"neural institute\\"  (what the hell is that???), the very idea that a single episode of infidelity by the wife would result in a psychotic break, that  a massive physical assault on her lover would be bargained down by a PA to commitment into a mental hospital,  the \\"wonderful\\" (NOT) therapist Cliff that broke all boundaries and ethical standards of conduct, etc. etc.  There were so many holes in this book, so many self indulgent confabulations by the writer that I felt it should have been presented as a fantasy, not a novel.  It is sad that my  book group naively accepted his portrayal as accurate, without analytical thought, that it did show the pain of being mentally ill.  OH PLEASE, it was so hard not to go into a lecture from Intro Psych about the difference between insanity and psychosis and the idea that people can snap into a psychosis, legal commitment, danger to self and others, therapeutic boundaries, etc. etc.  .  This book is so misleading that I resent paper being wasted/words spent on discussing it, let alone time spent reading the poor writing.
0783225547|5.0|Why call for help if you don't want to know what's going on and what could happen if you choose to ignore the warnings. Momma always said &#34;hard heads make soft butts.&#34;  In this case, the price was to high to pay.

B008Y212PI|4.0|Despite having only 1 color, I really enjoy this app! I think the ability to &quot;blast&quot; any unwanted blocks is a big plus. I don't like that you automatically see your mistakes, but otherwise very good!
1577314808|5.0|changed my life! different perspective on viewing the world and what really matters in our short period of life....I read it several times and each time its concept became clearer to me...I now read short excepts from it almost every day when I wake in the morning; it helps guide me in the right direction throughout my day. I am truly thankful it has come into my life.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Its pretty much the smallest media player out there. The only problem that I have is unlike other devices this doesnt go to the next episode in Netflix. Other than that this is awesome!
B000OVLBHG|4.0|This is not a great movie. It lacks any kind of subtlety. The acting is passable (but oddly a pretty good example of the fact that Neil Patrick Harris can just do about anything well). I gave this four stars, if nothing else, for the fact that it is a three star movie that I would still pick, hands down, over any modern Michael Bay movie done in the same vein. There is simply something charming about this pile of a movie.
B009LDD54K|5.0|after watching one episode at a friends house i just had to have this series... love it love it love
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I wasn't sure about buying this album, but I couldn't be more happy. Miley Cyrus you are an amzing singer, song, writer and artist! No one can argue that you can't sing and that you shouldn't be doing what you are doing! Please, never stop! I love your album and listening to your words! Thank you for this.
B00C9QQBA6|5.0|Having read a later book from this series I was very interested to go back to the beginning to discover how the tale began. I was not disappointed.<br />This is a wonderful story of a man, Aurelius, from the future, crash landing his space craft in 1897 America. There is a good mix of trepidation and interest from the inhabitants who discover him. The love story which unfolds between Aurelius and Emily is beautifully written and develops sensitively.<br />I would recommend this book to those who have read any of this series or anyone who loves a sci-fi read. I look forward to discovering more gems from this writer.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Soothing to the soul and just makes you want to play it again.  I really enjoy the entire CD. Can't go wrong with it.
B004IYISSK|5.0|I truly enjoyed revisiting this story. It made me think so much about my relationships as a daughter and a mother. I found it to be extremely touching and relevant.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Pleasantly surprised. What a different twist. A love story that was so funny that I was laughing out loud! Now the funniest part was at Thanksgiving dinner. I don't want to give anything away, but I laughed so much I almost had a accident. Emma brought a tear to my eyes and put a smile on my face. What a wonderful combination. You will just have to read it to understand. So I suggest you get your and start reading!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love the game but difficult to get tokens to play it. Too bad because I would like to continue playing g more games after the initial joining tokens are gone. Easy to get coins and points but not play tokens and that is what you use to play games with. I don't have extra money to invest in any game play.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel wasn't as good as his two previous novels, but it is still amazing. He weaves so many story lines together.
B002VH7P4O|4.0|I hate to play the role of devil's advocate when it comes to my Beatles.  The Beatles are my life, and it genuinely bugs me to give anything less than 5 stars for anything that bears their name.  But first, let me say that this is a fine collection of Beatles material.  You won't find a more complete collection anywhere.  The packaging is fantastic, I love the idea of everything in this cute little green apple, and it is small folks, much smaller than pictured.  Once you pop this into your PC or mobile USB port and find out how to get to the USB player, you will be in for a real treat.  You can access everything that is contained on the USB at a glance....all the music, videos and photos,,,all in one place.  You will particularly enjoy the photo of a complete list of everyone and everything on the Sgt Pepper cover!!!  Great care and craftsmanship went into the production of this USB device, no doubt about it.  As for the quality of the music, I can't say enough about it.  The 24-bit FLACs are absolutely phenomenal.  It's almost as if each track was painstakingly re-recorded as if it was just recorded yesterday.  The separation is far better than anything I've heard, and I've collected Beatles music all my life.  The vocals are crisper and cleaner than anything you've heard, the instruments sound as if they are right in front of you.  Frankly, you can't get better reproduction than what is contained here.  That being said, I have no argument about anything that is contained in this device.  What bugs me is what is NOT included here!!!  Absent is the Beatles Anthology recordings, including the rare Decca sessions.  I sure would have loved to have those in this collection.  Misery & There's A Place are not included here at all.  Also, notably absent are the US Capitol releases.  Some of these US releases sound far better than the UK masters, and have alternate intros, and false starts.  Also absent are the Christmas recordings, and I know those have been restored elsewhere.  What about also including rare videos and interviews???  It seems they were reluctant to include that sort of material here.  Perhaps they had planned to include more.  You will find that this device only contains about 9G of material on a 15G device.  Surely, they could have put that extra 6G to good use.  But I suppose all that is nitpicking.  I highly recommend this device for anyone who wants the majority of the Beatles catalog at their fingertips.  This device is surely going to skyrocket in price years from now when they are all playing together again at the pearly gates.  So Roll Up!!! and get yours today...&#34;If you want it, you better hurry cause it's going fast...make you mind up fast...better hurry cause they may not last!!!&#34; :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Worth the time and money.  Genuine.  She nails the character and the plot.  I haven't cried while reading a book in a long time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little device. It takes up no room at all and performs excellently. It puts a nice edge on my knives and also works great on the serrated edges.
0760703329|4.0|I bought this particular version of the complete works because it seemed to be the most straightforward - I didn't want any notes, annotations, or other things to get in the way, since I was getting it for pleasure reading in preparation for a Shakespeare course next semester. I bought it used, since it was less than $20 (great for a nearly broke college student), and I was amazed when it arrived. Other than the spine already being broken (which is preferable, new books are annoying to open) and very slight scuffing on the top two corners of the cover, it looks pristine. The text inside is a bit small, but easy to read in a two-column format, and like I expected, relatively free of slipped in add-ons. The top of each page has the work currently being read, which is helpful for me, personally. It's also amazingly gorgeous with gold edges, a gold bookmark ribbon, ivory pages, and inlaid red and gold designs in the black leather cover, and I can see myself holding on to this book for many years.

You will not be able to put this book down, nor stop thinking about the wonderful characters who inhabit it.  Highly recommend it.

0811879542|5.0|Beginning when he was around 2 (a precocious 2), my littlest one adored this book when it was given as a gift. It is more of an interactive book, and it feels to him absolutely magical that his completion of the instructions actually causes changes to the dots on the next page.<br /><br />Over the past year or so, all the other book gifts behave as most books do, appealing at first, then falling away in interest. I habitually recycle books in and out of our attic library. This one is NEVER forgotten. It might lose some interest after many days of repeated interaction, but it's not long before it is asked for again.<br /><br />It did not have the same effect on my 5-year-old. At first she indeed loved it as much as my 2-yr-old. But it did not stick with her the same way.<br /><br />It makes sense to me that the concept of this book will be most appealing to a child around age 3...when they are old enough to follow instructions, yet magically-minded enough to accept that the book can actually CHANGE just for them.<br /><br />I recommend that any potential buyer watch the little video on the main Amazon page for this book so you can see how it works. You can probably tell from that whether or not your child will enjoy the book.<br /><br />As for me, I think this is one of the most brilliant books ever created for this age bracket, and I am so pleased for all the magical moments my little guy has experienced while interacting with it!
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|I love the fact that Clary is a strong, exceptionally talented Shadowhunter. She's special, and often the only one who can save the day. I was annoyed with the death of such a young child and thought that it was unneccesary to keep the plot moving along. The Lightwood family didn't need this death to motivate them to action, they were ready and willing to fight to the death without a death of their own. I think it would have been better for Isabelle to walk in on Sebastian about to commit murder, she screams then he knocks her out, but has to run because people have heard the commotion. Anyway, highly recommended, can't wait for the 4th book.
076115728X|5.0|This was given for my perfectionist preschooler who loved to hear the book over and over and over--she found it magical in a way that, quite frankly, I did not really understand...I mean, I understood it on an intellectual level WHY it was good for her, but I did not really understand the emotional draw that she had toward the book.<br /><br />After a while, she began to reference the book in her own life, in various ways. This has continued over the last couple years on many topics, and even though we have not seen the book around lately, just the other day, she made a mistake in a drawing, and rather than becoming overwhelmed with grief as usually is the case, she turned it into something beautiful. Afterward, she said to me, \\"look, I made a beautiful OOPS!\\"<br /><br />I love the theme of acceptance this book has woven into this little Perfectionist's life.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|This was a GREAT read. I really liked the way it was told, always from Grace's point of view. Starting with her in 1999 at the age of 99 and then going back to her days as a house maid and then lady's maid. I got a bit annoyed with the confusion between Grace and Alfred and the fact that she chose Hannah, a family member, who she serves, and doesn't acknowledge her as family, over a man she could have had a really happy life with. Also despite going back over the last few chapters, I couldn't work out what Hannah had left for Grace in the box. This really bugs me, but other than those small criticisms this is the best book I've read in a long time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great story and well written. Brings a lot of the way we live and view the world and the public demand for the constant need to be entertained into perspective.
B003IDMUT0|4.0|This was my first (hopefully in a long list of many) John Grisham book (I've been meaning to read one for years). I thought this was a great book to start with. I really enjoyed the beginning where the family of a extremely rich guy (Donald Trump-esque) are waiting for him to die, and then when he does die they are waiting to see how much of his billions they are each getting. The relatives of the guy are repulsive in every way possible and feel assured that they are getting a good cut of his money, so they are spending all \\"their\\" money in the most obscene ways possible. Then the will is finally read out and they have been cut out of it. It's quite funny.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I am not anti-Rosetta Stone.  In fact, I tried Rosetta Stone and it is a top notch program; however I could not bring myself to dropping $600 in this economy to learn a foreign language.  This free program, I feel, is just as good as Rosetta stone.<br /><br />This program teaches by sight, sound, you talking into the microphone, you typing the words...  It teaches each word and combination of words through all the teaching methods.  Very nice.<br /><br />Both programs immerse you into the language right away.<br /><br />The very first lesson had four pictures.  It said: SELECT &#34;THE WOMAN&#34;.  the four pictures were of a woman, a girl, a boy, and a man.  Under each picture was the Spanish word for each.  Under the picture of the woman it had the Spanish word &#34;la mujer&#34;.  You pick that picture and you hear a Spanish speaking person say the word (make sure your volume is up).  From that lesson, you know instantly the Spanish word for &#34;The Woman&#34; was &#34;la mujer&#34;.  Each part builds on the previous lesson so you are truly immersed.<br /><br />You have hearts at the beginning of each lesson.  Each time you get something wrong, you lose a heart.  This program will not let you advance to the next level if you lose all of your hearts.  At first it annoyed me because I just wanted to get to the next level; however, I am glad this feature is here because each lesson builds on the lesson before - so if you don't know the material, it will make the next lesson very hard.<br /><br />I am learning Spanish and Syntax is important.  If you need the little squiggly line above the n as in Niña (girl), it won't count you wrong if you type in &#34;Nina&#34; (without the squiggly line) - *at least not yet - I am on lesson 4*, but it reminds you that it is important to use the proper n.  Find out where the special characters are on your device so you can us the proper characters.<br /><br />This program has a microphone feature so you can practice speaking thelanguage of your choice.  The program compiles your speech to make sure you said the phrase right.<br /><br />One downfall to this program is that you can only choose from around 5 different languages to learn.  I wanted to learn Japanese, but it didn't offer that language.  I guess it would be hard because the alphabetical characters are not on the typical device.<br /><br />I am only  on lesson 4 so I don't know how deep the lessons go into learning your language.  I do know Rosetta Stone takes you all the way, so if this program doesn't go as far as Rosetta stone, then Rosetta Stone is the better program.  As I see it now, they are both equal.<br /><br />Bottom line is this:  If you want to learn a foreign language, this is a top notch program.
0545615402|5.0|If you want all 3 of the supplemental tales from Harry's world, then get this boxed set.  The binding is great and the stories are wonderful.  A great addition to any Potterhead's shelf.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|A good movie for Jaden Smith to make his debut in a starring role.<br />Great movie for a younger audience.  Violent parts - so not for very young children.  Missed the comic Will Smith - he was a very stern, unemotional father/commander.  Good movie for small screen.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Television at its finest.  Superior acting, creative script,  excellent plot twists. Why can't there be more shows like this on television?
B00014TJ7K|5.0|This CD is one of his best of his solo works! Other than the two bonus tracks that are ok. There is not one bad song on this cd. I had bought this cd when it first come out. I loved it then and I love it now. Great songs that are timeless! A MUST HAVE!!!
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|I may be a little biased on this review as Alter Bridge is by far my favorite band. Looking at it from a subjective standpoint, no band comes close to what these guys can do. Honestly, album just gets better the more I listen to it. It's everything I want in music. Mark lays down some gnarly solos, Myles hits notes that make me shake my head and smile. Brian and Scott keep the rhythm going heavy and strong. There is no one better.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is probably the greatest show ever created in the 21st century.  The producers and writers just keep hitting home runs with episodes.  This is one of the few shows that will be able to go out on it's own terms rather than be cancelled.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great book with lots of eye opening information. Definately something everyone who has ever had a stomach ache or weight issue needs to read.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Roy was kind and gave me an ebook copy of Everville. Thank you.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable read, with similarities with the Never Ending Story and the Thomas Covenant series. While the main character is well developed, some secondary (yet important) characters could have been better defined. The plot and story are nicely developed and the writing was well done. There is a nice use of foreshadowing.<br /><br />Young adult readers will find it a fun read. Older readers may find it predictable.
0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it. The Lightning Thief appears a book only for children, but upon opening I was sucked into a collision of mythical names and modern locations that provided much entertainment. Taking Mythology classes in high school, it was fun to have that background knowledge of the characters while reading, but it is not necessary. The plot line is easy to follow and the vocabulary is exceptional for all ages.<br />  Percy Jackson finds out he is a demigod, which means his father is a god of Olympus. While at Camp Half Blood, his father is revealed and he is sent on a quest to clear both of their names and find out who is the lightning thief. While searching the country for Zeus' mater bolt, Hades sends monsters to try and stop Percy. He encounters many mythical creatures and gods, while accompanied by his two friends, Annabeth and Grover.<br />  This book is full of adventure and surprises. Riordan's writing keeps you wanting to read more, unconsciously flipping through the pages. Percy is a courageous 12 year-old and the world's fate lies in his hands.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app saved me from buying a new Windows computer....it is just as good as Microsoft word!! Kindle continues to amaze me every day!

B000INAXGU|5.0|I love it.. takes me back.. his music was made for 2013! I wish more people knew of him! :-)
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|This show will make you laugh for hours with it's 9th season! I love it so much!! also the quality is really good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing but you should add Redstone I'm trying to troll my friend but there is no Redstone you should add Redstone and infinite world and monetary and sprinting like golly it takes like forever to get around
B009GED3HS|5.0|This show will make you laugh for hours with it's 8th season! I love it so much!! also the quality is really good.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! It is definitely a cross between Harry Potter and The Hunger Games only better.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I always hate ending a good series of well written books. It is like losing a close set of friends. Glad to know there is some sense of a happy ending for Sookie. Great read......all of them are!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|it is a very interesting book!!!  Les Miserables is one of my favorite books that i must bring it with me on the plane.  One thing i do not like is that this book contains a large amount of French, anyway, i do enjoy reading it.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|I love most of the shows and movies that Joss Whedon has released.  That and the fact that the trailer looked good (coupled with good reviews) made me think I would like this movie.  I found it so boring that I almost stopped watching it a third of the way through.  I also couldn't understand half of what the characters were saying.  I am glad that many people liked it because it means more fan love for Joss and possibly more content coming from that brilliant mind of his.  I am not a Shakespeare fan, but I guess I had to be to enjoy this movie.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I decided to purchase this book because I have a new Korean daughter in law and I wanted to know more about the culture that fortunately my daughter in law did not have to experience as she is from Seoul. It saddens me to think that people still have to live under such repression. I love history and enjoyed learning about how the north and south came to be divided and the US participation in the Korean War.  This book helps you appreciate the blessing we enjoy living in a democracy.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|Excellent.  Proving that that the group was not all Weiland, they produce 5 killer, hook laden jams.  Can't wait to hear more. BRAVO!  The Brothers De Leo= most underrated guitar/bass team in Rock.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Good book with good examples of how people make decisions.  It is fascinating to see how people behave under different circumstances and just how predictable they are.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|If you like anything STP related you need to go buy this immediately. This is only an EP with 5 new songs, but these 5 songs are great rockin' tunes. This is what the fans deserve from this great band, and all of these 4 and 5 star reviews for this EP are deserved by the band as well. This truly is an amazing piece of music here and you should really check it out.<br /><br />The only thing next us die hard STP fans can hope for is a full length album coming somewhat soon. After all of the years of putting up with Mr. Weilands' rubbish, i am glad the other 3 have decided to move along with out him. This is proof that although Mr. Weiland was a great part of the band, he wasn't the most importand ingredient in this equation here. And this is coming from a huge Scott Weiland fan as well, i am not taking sides at all. I love his two solo albums, and i have a son named Weiland (again, i'm a huge STP fan!). But with this situation, it is proven that Scott was holding the band back and was more like a poison to them for quite some time. I truly hope he get's his act together though.<br /><br />The music does the talking, and this will hopefully be how STP will continue on with their Legacy. This EP is a great way to show that they still got it and it's a great sign of hopefully more great things to come from these talented musicians and songwriters!<br /><br />So quit reading all of these reviews and just buy it already!! You won't be sorry!
B002MY9NF0|1.0|OK, OK ... i was thinking about DUNE the other day and i remembered that my past attempts to watch it and NOT fall asleep failed repeatedly.  so i thought it would be free on PRIME or the like and i could give it another shot.  not free.  had to PAY actual MONEY to watch it!  wow i hope i can save some of you from that fate.  DUDE.  MAN.  i have to say i was prepared to deal with it sucking a little... and i was fully prepared to enjoy it.  heck i WANTED to enjoy it.<br /><br />i DARE you to watch it and NOT picture the gang from MST3000 superimposed in the bottom of the screen.  and, if you can picture such a thing, imagine what 'star wars' combined with 'stargate' would have been like directed by terry gilliam, edited by michael j. fox and with a musical score by that kid from down the street who insists on playing renditions of classical solos on his purple ibanez electric guitar.<br /><br />...so take that, THEN make the dude from 'frasier' luke skywalker, have darth vader played by john belushi's character in 'animal house', use voice-over in every scene to explain what the movie is trying to portray, load it up with lots of meaningless allegory-ishness, AND have it NOT be a comedy OR in the least bit funny.<br /><br />if, somehow, that description sounds mildly amusing in its OWN way, trust me when i say i've oversold it.  i feel that i owe myself an apology for even watching it.  that's how TRULY BAD this movie is.  the world would be a better place if the film DUNE was erased from existence so that its completely ludicrous legend of greatness couldn't lure in any more innocent victims to have their even modest expectations be savagely crushed by an avalanche of SUCK.<br /><br />if you are still reading, or have skipped to the end, just don't watch this turd unless you are some kind of academic studying terrible movies for SCIENCE.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have a hard time putting this game down.  Additional and fun plus you're concentrating on the game and for a time the world goes away.
B000VE439Y|5.0|This is kind of a romp. It's a fun film to watch.  It's perfect for viewing by a group, as it's not a serious story, it's just playful.  It's directed by the great Terry Gilliam, from the Monty Python comedy group.
1451648537|5.0|I bought this book Steve Jobs as a gift for my son since it was available at a much better price than I found locally
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|I would not recommend, weak story line, seems low budget & unbelievable.  Only one known actor. Not worth the cost of rental.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very nice Solitaire... the graphics and sound are smooth - no &#34;Commodore 64&#34; chunky looking cards or blippy sound effects. The card-backs look really great. You can tap cards and have them automatically move or touch and drag them old-school. Definitely FIVE stars!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I LOVE it but I have a problem It wont let me go on eneymore and I cant redownload it
B00CTT9646|4.0|First of all, let me state - for the record - that this review is for THIS PRODUCT, not the film (which I loved).<br /><br />I don't get many &#34;limited edition&#34; or &#34;deluxe edition&#34; or &#34;any edition&#34; things, but when I saw this, I had to have it. (Fortunately, my wife agreed!) And I love it. It arrived on time and in good condition. It came in a large, Star Trek-themed box that I can't seem to throw away, and the phaser was inter-packaged separately from the Blu-ray case.<br /><br />The movie itself was an excellent Blu-ray transfer (sound and picture quality - 5 stars), and the phaser looks and feels amazing. It comes with a stand so it can be displayed 'standing up', which is how we have it. The phaser is hefty and solid-feeling, which I was very impressed with. And the front tip spins around to either the 'kill' or 'stun' mode, which I wasn't expecting. (You can see this 'flip' from 'kill' to 'stun' in the scene with Kirk and Benedict Cumberbatch have just arrived on the enemy Starfleet shit and are formulating a plan with Scotty.)<br /><br />The only -- and I really do mean ONLY -- reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because the phaser doesn't have...a trigger. To some, that may seem a petty complaint, but there you have it. I miss the trigger.<br /><br />But don't let this one niggly complaint dissuade you. If you're a Star Trek fan and like props, this is the edition for you. The phaser isn't some plasticky, schlocky giveaway -- it's a solid, well-built collectible. I have mine prominently displayed so I can see it every day.<br /><br />Live long and prosper!

B006P0FICE|3.0|Funny, some what entertaining for a lazy day.  Nothing too exhausting, and its predictable, but a fair movie to watch even a couple of times over the course of a number of months.
B003Y8YXGC|5.0|Some really good songs here. Great arrangements. Great rockers and beautiful ballads from the King of Rock n` Roll. Nice job on this re-release, Yoko. Cheers!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Had a problem with updating for kindle, uninstalled and reinstalled and it updated on its own..  I also need neighbors. Please add. FARZJRD...Thank you...
B003B02PFO|5.0|I guess that I'm just weird. Whille a lot of other readers didn't like the characters, I would think that would be the goal of the writer considering the neighbors are supposed to be jerks and Luther is kind of fighting fire with fire. It's what makes the novel as funny as it is. That said I came across this story first as Christmas With The Kranks and got so interested in the movie that I wanted to read the book. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed in the least. It's a must read for any Christmas nut like I am.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|In general I was pleased with all of the above.  I like to be entertained, Zealot is informative, but not entertaining, the rest were great
B001992NUQ|5.0|this is an excellent movie for all good movie lovers. The product is very good as well, the blu-ray came flawless and the quality is excellent!
B001FB55H6|5.0|Great story, great characters, each one with it's own human condition, even Dr. Manhattan!! I bought this because of the extras included, all of them were great!! Highly recommended
B002ZG981E|5.0|Nolan is a great director, this movie will keep your attention all along! excellent for sharing with your family, not so recommended for a date haha
B005LAIIGW|2.0|This film has little story and characters as thin as the paper they were printed on. The 3-D effects were very good. The ending is another implausible up-beat Hollywood studio ending that sucked big time. While the effects were cheesy 1969's \\"Marooned\\" had a much more believable conclusion. This is in the vein of \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" two people must work together in an inhospitable environment in order to survive. Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune are much better actors than either Clooney and especially Bullock. \\"Hell in the Pacific\\" also had a much more logical and far better ending than this FX driven piece of treacle has. If you want my attention for 90 minutes than you better have a well developed story with well developed characters. This FX fest had neither.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't get enough of this show! Started it and can't turn it off. Reminds me of great Jane Austen novel!
1476729085|1.0|I confess i only made it 44 pages into the book.  It's so bad.  I could have been a cute episode of the big bang theory--the main character is sheldon..no more, no less.  nothing remotely original. Plus, it's 295 pages, but the pages are smaller than regular--the typed area is 4\\"x6.5\\" AND each chapter starts 2/3rds down the page.  So basically it's a stretched out short story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the book. It's not my normal thing, but it had good reviews and everyone needs a change from time to time!!! The stories interweave and domino from each other and I thought it was a creative way to tell it. I liked it a bunch and I'm glad I read it. It reads fairly quickly and so I can honestly say I didn't get bored, which is awesome for me!!!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Pretty irreverant and flippant.  Just ok.  Good for a person just learning that their thoughts and attitudes can influence their life.  Just not my thing anymore.  I bought it because they were reading it at the Unity Church I attend.  I get a little tired of the focus on materializing more stuff in your life.
B0006AAS5G|2.0|Of course my husband waited until after the return window to tell me that it never told time accurately, but now there's water damage too?!  It looks like a great watch but it's merely a front before the actual mechanics.  I won't be purchasing another Invicta again!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|These guys just keep getting better and better! I hope they never stop making music. I could listen to them all day, oh yea I do, he he. You are missing out if you are narrow minded and think all they have is mmmbop. They are so talented. :)  Joy Boyd
B00DZAWPNM|3.0|When I heard Miss Jackson, I thought they were going towards more the punk rock sound and I liked that idea, it would've been cool. Then, I heard This is Gospel and I liked it but I still expecting a bit of punk rock but, I was wrong.<br /><br />First of all, Brendon's voice was way too auto-tuned. His voice is godly and it wasn't necessary for it. It kinda killed some of the songs vibe.<br /><br />Second, none of the other songs sound like Miss Jackson or This is Gospel. It's more like 80's pop/electronic type. That doesn't mean it horrible but it just doesn't suit Panic!<br /><br />Lastly, the lyrics don't have a lot meaning and the songs could have been put more effort into it. Like, the chorus repeats and repeats. There's not a lot of words to it.<br /><br />My favorite songs of the album is This is Gospel, Miss Jackson, Vegas Lights and Nicotine.<br />The End Of All Things could have been a favorite it wasn't for the robotic auto-toned.<br /><br />It's worth listening to, though. It's not their best, I must say. Overall, I feel very neutral about this. I was expecting better, though.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great free app i would recamend not compicated at all perfect,all i would want  just would recamend to any one

B00E687MWQ|4.0|The Music Slithers Like A Snake Ramping Through The Amazon River Night. The Record Lets The Vocals And The Music Creep inside Your Head Nicely. After All, How Far Can You Take The Speed Music Thing Anymore. Slowing It Down At Times Is A Smart Move And Very Effective. Especially When Done Right, Like These Guys did It. The More You Listing To This Record. The More it Starts To Break Through And Make Perfect Sense. Although Some Songs Just Plain Miss All Together. Songs Like NOCTURNAL FLAME, WALKER, NEKROHAVEN, AGELESS NORTHERN SPIRITS and PHOENIX. Are The Songs I Dig The Most On This Record. Listen To Them, You Get The Sense Of Just How Cool It Must Be To Live In Norway For A Winter Or Two.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I like adventure and there is not a lot here.  THIS game is basicly just a hidden object game. Its better than boredom.

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I'd like my sister to read this book to see what it has to say about sisterhood as well as humanness. I'd recently see the documentary &#34;Project Nim&#34; for the second time and haven't gotten over my anger at the designer of the experiment who hadn't given any thought to the outcomes for the chimp or the humans involved. I thought foresight was one of the things that distinguished humans from animals. Guess not.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Fun,  educational and entertaining. There is a great deal of detail found in this app.  Interesting use of World War II arms. Would like to see more done with additional weapons.

B000FC130E|4.0|I read American Gods, and was disappointed.  I'm not sure what I expected, but that wasn't it.  This one, although similarly set in a semi-real, semi-mythical world, just worked better.  Unlike the protagonist of the other book, Richard convinced me to care about him, and the rest of the book flowed easily.  I wasn't going to read any more Gaiman, until a friend told me about this one; now I'll at least try some more.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|What else can you say about this movie?  The film is one of a kind and Daniel Day Lewis is at his best playing a greedy oilman.  I give it my highest praise.  Plus the price for the DVD was outstanding.
B0000029LG|5.0|Both discs looked as if they were new and unused. I was very surprised. I will definitely shop again in the future.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a great app for putting all your ideas, dreams &amp; plans in one spot....organized &amp; easy to access! Being able to &quot;pin&quot; the things I like makes it easier to refer to the sites when I need to find my favorite things!! :-)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to this series. Not a happily ever after fairytale ending but more appropriate for a story that takes you through  so much sadness and so many lost lives.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game!  Addicting it takes me a while to get off wonderful to young. children. and bronies. bye
0757302661|2.0|We prepared for the birth of our son with a doula who was really big on HypnoBirthing.  However, the problem is that HypnoBirthing does not really factor in complications during labor or delivery.  We are sure this would work if conditions were PERFECT, but it does not prepare us for the unexpected.  Not only did we not use any of the HypnoBirthing techniques, we did not even call our doula in to assist.  Our dream of a natural, beautiful delivery did not happen but we still have a beautiful, healthy baby to show for the rough start.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game.  it is so fun and changes everytime so you don't get bored.  the boards are challenging enough and get faster as you get further into them.  I would definitely recommend this game.

0374533571|4.0|This was a very interesting read for me after I watched the movie and fell in love with it.  The book has a slightly different angle to it then the movie.  I was a little disappointed in the ending just because I wanted more.  However, if you watched the movie and enjoyed it I would recommend reading the book and getting a deeper look inside the mind of Pat.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|As a former Titan II Missile Facilities Technician, this was a page-turner for me.  The author got it right in his descriptions of the attitudes and culture in the missile career field, the systems in use, even the music we listened to back then.  It is rare for a military themed book written by a non-military writer to be so spot-on (IMO).  The descriptions of some of the close calls we (we citizens) had with H-bombs are chilling, and the story about the Damascus Arkansas Titan II explosion was weaved in perfectly throughout the book.  Time well spent.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I've wanted to try cutting bottles for many years and always thought it was a come on. I've done a couple now and the first one went off without a hitch. The second one fractured a bit but didn't affect the cut. Overall I'm really impressed with this tool. It is compact, lightweight, easy to use and a good price. The assembly instructions could be a little more explicit.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|If you like Depp or Thompson this is not to be missed.  Much of the story is autobiographical regarding Thompsons stint in San Juan.  The behind the scenes look into the ugly world of paradise destroying real estate developers is as true today as it was then.  Thompson always served as our moral compass, for those of us that could look past his self destructive proclivities,  This is a funny film. Depp shines channeling Thompson.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. Guys you can tell the ladies you want to watch a Romance and bring this to the blu-ray player. There's romance, violence, humor, twists and excellent acting performances by Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette. This is a story about a young couple accidentally ending up with a suitcase full of the mob's cocaine and going on the run to get it sold. The ensuing chase ends up leaving carnage in its path. It has some great heavy hitters with small parts but absolutely stunning performances. It isn't often mentioned that James Gandolfini played a part as one of the mobs foot soldiers but he does a scene with Patricia Arquette that is so violent it is almost unwatchable. In terms of rating this disc quality on blu-ray what can I say? HD is spectacular.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this app. It improved my logic skills. I have played other games like this but this is by far the best.The way it incorporates the puzzles in the pictures is amazing.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Yes I managed to watch the whole series over two days and have turned into a walker myself. Addictive and compelling viewing. Great characters and a thrilling story line. Bring on series 4!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Saw this on someone else's bike and ordered one for my self.  No installation required, easily fits my Garmin and protects it if I drop it which happens sometimes

B00EY8A6BC|1.0|LOVED the movie, but really displeased with the Amazon movie player app.  even though we PAID for HD streaming, we were not able to view it in HD at all on our mac mini (which is hooked up to our bigscreen TV).  It was jumpy and would pause the video while the audio was still going, and then the video would blur forward and catch up.  IT was terrible.  We tried pausing it to allow the video to buffer, but NOPE.  The Amazon player doesn't buffer!!!  ?  WTF?  Also, guess what?  there's NO WAY to get a refund from Amazon for a movie.  If you rent it, too bad so sad. I read the terms and conditions, and everything.  We ended up watching it on iTunes instead.  Thanks a lot Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are ok. some are good and some are stupid.<br /> you have to figure out what to do in each game so it  may take a couple of games for you to figure out how to get the points. still not had to bad for time to pass plus it was free.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|She is good. I have friends that told me I would like her in the past and I refused to buy her stuff since she was &#34;rock&#34;. Now that I have heard this one I want to get some of her older stuff to see what it sounds like.

B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I think one should have the option of being able to pick whether you can play someone or you can play the computer off line. Making this game an offline game may encourage more people to play. Other than that, great game!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Both the kids really love this game as it doesn't require a lot of thinking. You can get pretty far without having to purchase anything and they are constantly updating and expanding the game.

B00BT70J7M|5.0|The Wagner-Decca album of Jonas Kaufmann has just won the Gramophone Award 2013, proposing a new standard of quality for lyrical recitals: the highest musical level, interpretive contribution and novelty, expressed therein in the original version of Lohengrin's farewell and in the \\"Wesendonck Lieder\\" cycle, singing as tenor on this occasion. The German artist now begins his career in a new record label, Sony, and chooses for it a tribute to Giuseppe Verdi, composer whose bicentennial is being celebrated and who lives at the core of the heart of opera fans.<br /><br />A magnificent composer who feels great, vibrant and uneven in titles such as \\"Nabucco\\" or \\"I Lombardi\\"; who reaches heights in \\"Rigoletto\\", \\"La Traviata\\", \\"Un ballo in maschera \\" and \\"Othello\\", and who even becomes intellectual and affected in \\"Falstaff\\". Baritone Leo Nucci, talking about the musician from Roncole, said in 1995 that \\"the day that Giuseppe Giacomini, Nicola Martinucci and Lando Bartolini no longer sing, this is over. I think that the Italian tradition with those voices is over, because Pavarotti sings everything, but he is not a singer, he is a character who is beyond the world of opera.\\"<br /><br />To some extent, his dire prophesy has been fulfilled, to the point that La Scala opens on 7 December with a \\"Traviata\\" performed by a German soprano, Diama Damrau, and a Polish tenor, Piotr Beczala. Both are extraordinary, but are they Verdian? Beczala himself said in 2012: \\"Verdi's roles for tenors are complicated and musically complex. \\"Verdi's roles for babies', such as Alfredo or the Duke, which are the ones I sing, are the introduction to \\"adult\\" roles, such as Gustavo, Don Carlo, Manrico, Radames or, at the end of the line, ¡Othello!\\". Damrau, trained in Mozart and Handel, sang a great Gilda (\\"Rigoletto\\") and is an acclaimed Violetta Valery, but it is hard to think of her performing other great Verdian heroines.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann (1969), after a career that started in 1992 (hisis not a last minute career, as some people think), became famous as Alfredo, in a \\"Traviata\\" production of the New York Metropolitan in 2006, with Angela Gheorghiu. \\"When I came out on stage to receive the applause, I realized that something had happened,\\" he remembers. Since then, his journey has reached unforeseen heights with \\"Werther\\" (Massenet), \\"Fidelio\\" (Beethoven) and \\"Lohengrin\\" (Wagner), as also with other Verdis. Above all with \\"Don Carlo\\", acclaimed in Zurich, London, Munich and, recently, in Salzburg.<br /><br />This album, available from September 17, confirms the standard of the Wagner album and sheds light on the future of the great Verdian singing. Everything is taken care of, from the design and photographs to the choice of repertoire and the names on the cast: Kaufmann; expert Pier Giorgio Morandi conducting the Orchestra of the Parma Opera; the Piacenza Municipal Theatre Chorus, and baritone Franco Vassallo, intervening in \\"Don Carlo\\" and \\"Othello\\".<br /><br />The choice of \\"La donna è mobile\\" of the unscrupulous Duke of \\"Rigoletto\\", who opens fire, a role which the tenor sang with great success in Zurich with Leo Nucci in 2005, sounds like a farewell. But Kaufmann hopes this is not so because he is determined to continue alternating lighter roles like this one with others that require another density. \\"In middle of the functions of 'Trovatore' in Munich I had to replace the tenor scheduled to sing 'Lohengrin', and it gave me great pleasure to feel that my singing, coming from Verdi, seemed softer, more liquid and closer to the Italian characteristics that Wagner expected for his opera\\", he says. The record does not include Alfredo, but almost all the others are there: Riccardo, Manrico, Rodolfo, Gabriele, Carlo, Alvaro, Othello and even Macduff.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann sets out to introduce something different in each character, always mastering his \\"messa di voce\\", his \\"pianissimo\\" and a burning dark baritone color, which toughens interpretations that are never monochrome. On the contrary, in each one of his portrayals, the hero shows ardor and vulnerability, passion and despondency.<br />He shines in the arias of \\"Un ballo in maschera\\" and Riccardo will surely be a great role in his career, because he has the lightness and charm for \\"Di' tu se fedele\\", and is a real smothered volcano in \\"Ma se m'è forza perderti\\". \\"Celeste Aida\\" is pure lyricism (with final sfumando) and desire after a vibrant \\"Se quel guerrier io fossi!\\", accordingly emphasized. His \\"Ah! si, ben mio\\" exudes sweetness and anticipates the coming sorrow, but then charges with the tenor's cabaletta par excellence, \\"Di quella pira\\", high C included! Rodolfo's aria, \\"Quando le sere al placido\\", from \\"Luisa Miller\\" could not be absent, anger leading to pain and then to angelic remembrance in \\"lo sguardo innamorato\\" and \\"t'amo, dicea\\". Fury fills \\"O inferno! Amelia qui\\", of \\"Simon Boccanegra\\", which precedes his lovely \\"Don Carlo\\", a title of which he should make a complete recording in French and Italian; Franco Vasallo is Rodrigo de Posa in the duet that sets aflame the theaters of the world, \\"Dio nell'alma infondere\\". \\"La Forza del Destino\\" became part of his repertoire in December and here is the scene and aria from the spinto Don Alvaro of Act III, \\"La vita è inferno all'infelice... O tu, che in seno agli angeli\\", of such a complex structure and jumping all over the staff. Another Carlo is added, quite unknown, that Kaufmann sang in 2005: the Carlo from \\"I Masnadieri\\", \\"rol di forza\\" which takes him from high to low notes in the demanding \\"Destatevi, o pietre! ... Giuri ognun questo canuto\\". \\"Othello\\" is to be staged in a couple of years; the previews are \\"Dio ! Mi potebi scagliar\\" --Kaufmann is \\"dolcissimo\\" in \\"l'anima acqueto\\" and wildly aristocratic in \\"Ah! Dannazione! Pria confessi il delitto e poscia muoia!\\"-- and \\"Niun mi tema\\", where right from the start the Moor seems out of the world, as if he were meditating on his tragedy: \\"Otello fu\\" is an ascertaining for himself, not for others. The de luxe album adds \\"Ah, la paterna mano\\" of \\"Macbeth\\" which after all the foregoing, seems child's play.<br /><br />It's no coincidence that on August 25 of this year, Plácido Domingo, when asked by The Telegraph who was going to be the next great tenor, replied: \\"Oh, it is already Jonas Kaufmann\\".
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I ordered the 3D version sight unseen because I really like zombie movies.  This one is different in that unlike most zombie movies these zombies don't slowly plod along, these zombies are fast and really add to the tension.  Also, the are different scenes that build the story and add to it's eventual climax.  The special effects are great and the story line was actually pretty convincing.  I read the negative reviews, but to be honest I don't understand their points and why they felt that way.<br />I would highly recommend this film if not for purchase definitely for rental!
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|On April 14th 2010, Jonas Kaufmann became the first German tenor in 103 years to sing Cavaradossi (from Puccini's \\"Tosca\\") in the New York Met. On November 18th he was be the first to play the role of Maurizio in \\"Adriana Lecouvreur\\" (Cilea) which has not been performed in Covent Garden since 1906. In midst of all these landmarks appears the \\"Verismo Arias\\" (Decca) album, which has been qualified as one of the most extraordinary opera recitals recorded in recent years. The repertoire does not include Puccini because, in Kaufmann's words: \\"Italians separate Puccini from verismo. There's a certain delicacy and elegance in him which are not to be found in verismo which is rougher and more violent.\\"<br /><br />The album starts with \\"Giulietta e Romeo\\" by Riccardo Zandonai. This is Romeo's great scene and aria, \\"Giulietta, son io\\", in which the young Montague weeps over his lover's tomb. \\"I doubt that more personal feelings could ever be put into music. To listen to it is like intruding into someone's intimacy\\", says Kaufmann, who reaches a straining point with a devilish fiato in an obscure music which allows him nevertheless to deliver very moving subtleties. After hearing this, it's not hard to foresee what he will do with the final scene of \\"Otello\\" (Verdi).<br /><br />The breadth of his crescendo, the internal vibration of each word, the vigor of his \\"recitativo\\", his multiple tones, his torrid sensuality which becomes lyricism, his nuances and pianissimos, and his huge range make one wonder whether there is something that Kaufmann should not sing. \\"He has everything,\\" wrote The New York Times in its review of the album.<br /><br />Kaufmann never dreamt of one day being able to do \\"Vesti la giubba\\" (\\"I Pagliacci\\" by Leoncavallo), in which he highlights Canio's bitterness and brutality, or the \\"Cavalleria Rusticana\\" (Mascagni) arias, with Turiddu transformed into a frightened little boy in \\"Mamma, quel vino è generoso\\", but now both operas form a part of his Metropolitan risky double programme. \\"This music not only causes physical and emotional weariness, but it is also mentally tiresome. It is hard to remain the same after singing this repertoire. One has to abandon oneself to the music,\\" he says.<br /><br />As occurs with Zandonai's Romeo, it seems as though one were prying into the intimacy of Kaufmann himself. It happens with \\"Amor ti vieta\\" (very brief and brimming with passion); in the arias of Maurizio (elegant as rarely to be seen in verismo, specially \\"La dolcissima efigie\\", in which the main character compares Adriana's beauty to his flag... and also in the weariness and despair of \\"L'anima ho stanca\\"), and particularly in the fragments of \\"Andrea Chénier\\" (Giordano): his \\"Improvviso\\" is of an overwhelming and overpowering eloquence, and contrasts with the lyrical rapture with which he performs \\"Come un bel dí di Maggio\\". In the duet \\"Vicino a te\\" he forms an ideal couple with Eva Maria Westbroek, who has a huge and gorgeous voice.<br /><br />The record also includes \\"Lamento di Federico\\" from \\"L'Arlesiana\\" (Cilea), which Kaufmann has transformed into a memorable part of his recitals by proposing a trip from the initial intimate confidence of \\" (...) e s'addormi\\" to the despair of \\"Mi fai tanto male! Ahimè!\\"; the interesting \\"Testa adorata\\" from Leoncavallo's forgotten \\"Bohème\\"; two fragments from \\"Mefistofele\\" (Boito); \\"Sí, questa estrema grazia\\", from \\"I Lituani\\", and \\"Cielo e mar!\\", from \\"La Gioconda\\", both by Ponchielli, and another rarity, the lovely song \\"Ombra di nube\\" by Licinio Refice. Antonio Pappano conducts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia of Rome.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Don't know if to recommend the book or the movie first.  I saw the movie first, so I think that the insights and additional  information given was helpful.  It does show you how great a job that Ang Lee did to create the movie from this book.

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Born in 1968 (yes I'm a youthful 44) I grew up through the 70s listening to Kiss, Cheap Trick, Zeppelin and the best of classic rock ever created. Going through the 1980s I was a teenager playing all the heavy metal hair band stuff and influenced by MTV videos. Wasn't too thrilled about music through the 90s however. Mostly angry and sludgy stuff. And today we have bands like Shinedown and Alter Bridge. I'm a huge fan. The Alter Bridge BLACKBIRD release from 2007 is still a bit under rated and is an amazingly powerful and passionate collection of songs with great guitar work. With this new AB record, they do not disappoint. Myles Kennedy is truly rock music's secret weapon. You know we love you Myles. I also happen to be one of Orlando's best all around rock bassists(modestly I say that here). I mention this because the bass guitar work of Journey and Loverboy (the late Scott Smith) were bass guitar lines that were truly distinctive and HEARD very clearly through the mix of their recordings. Too many rock bands today just have the bass guitar as an underlying thumping tone that seems to get mixed in the music. Some of you understand this perfectly well. Of course Brian Marshall is a \\"new breed\\" of great bassists just holding the bottom end down. I get that just fine. Wish there was more distinctive bass lines that drove a few songs-not always Myles and Mark's guitar work. It's all great too!!! No negativity here people! The band has given us another wonderful group of songs. Myles is the real thing with his passionate vocal work and superb guitar playing that so many don't yet appreciate. I guess all that's important in the end is that those of us who DO KNOW how good this music is...is all that matters. Sonically, the recording sounds great too! Picked up the new CD at Best Buy on sale at time of release with the added bonus track. Life is great. Thank you Alter Bridge! Brett Warnelis.

B001N3GUIE|5.0|It was fun watching the first real primo sci fi movie. Lots of the action sequences might be considered to be cheesy by younger viewers, but I'm almost 80 and have been a fan forever, it seems, so I've watched special effects grow and mature with CG. Robbie the Robot went on to star in the TV show, &#34;Lost in Space,&#34; among other things. No CG, so Robbie was operated by human inside with, what seems now, as special effects that were then state-of-the-art.<br /><br />This BD version was sharp and clear images with excellent sound.

0441172717|5.0|Dune is a book that requires the reader to think. Frank Herbert has created an amazing work of science fiction that survives the test of time. Set 10,000 years into the future, Dune explores many variables of human condition. The book poses several important questions: what it means to be human? what is the danger of the uncontrolled technological progress? How can we better ourselves mentally and physically in a world where computers are forbidden by a religious decree? These and many more questions Frank Herbert's novel explores in detail. The book is a true classic and a rare gem in all of science fiction universe. The setting, the plot, the characters really draw the reader in. Frank Herbert's style is both simple and elegant, at times lyrical, exposing the readers to a world of wonder that is the desert planet Arrakis, known as Dune. I immensely enjoyed the book and read it at least five times, and every time I discovered something new and wonderful in its philosophy. I highly recommend it to all who likes science fiction.<br /><br />David Crane
0099547953|5.0|The book was well written. Is in plain and easy language without unnecessary added drama. I will recommend this to friends.
0307476073|5.0|It's a great true story. A lesson in learning how to find yourself in the wilderness... I read it last year and I'm introducing it to my bookclub this month. Hear they've begun making the movie. Shooting in Ashland, Oregon on Oct. 22nd with Reese Witherspoon playing Cheryl Strayed. There are many good reasons to read the book.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Everyone told me this movie was really bad, I actually enjoyed it alot. There were alot of Emotional scenes that really make this movie great. Well done M. Night Shyamalan, you finally struck gold.
0399159347|5.0|Ordinarily I would never have picked up a book with this cheesy title but I am so glad I did.  The cover looks like it's a beach read, but I have been talking about it with friends a lot.  I don't want to put in any spoilers but the plot twists and the epiloge are intriguing and give the reader plenty to think about...there is so much involved, the main topic being...would you open a letter addressed to you in the event of your husband's death, when he has not died?  Lots of discussion on this!  Don't miss this, I couldn't put it down.

B00BEMTP6I|1.0|This is a great CD but it isn't real! John Frusciante is an amazing artist and the songs are great! One of his best albums, but amazon sent me a fake one!!!!! There isn't any copyright information and you can tell that its fake by looking at it. Also the CD doesn't have the right sticker. Oh ya and the CD's sound quality is terrible. Don't buy this one. Make sure the one you are buying is real first!!!
1609611543|5.0|I have been (mostly) gluten free for about 2-3 months. My doctor recommended I try a gluten free lifestyle and suggested this book as a good starting point. I started the book and started my new &#34;diet&#34;.  I did feel good when I first started, but I was not convinced I was gluten sensitive... I could have a cookie here or something battered there... I let myself believe that if I could cheat a little that I was not in fact gluten sensitive... I was so wrong! Pizza kills me, If i have a sandwich my stomach will complain for hours. I have come to the realization that I am gluten intolerant, and any significant amount of gluten in my daily life will make me miserable. Get the book, eliminate the gluten, feel better!!
B003M6FGTE|3.0|Liked it in the beginning; the singing and dancing, but the basic plot became old; repeated over and over, with just a few variations.  We stopped watching in the middle of the season
B008RF0M9O|1.0|Not really pleased with this cheap version of the pads for my Sony headphones. I DID get another set once before at a similar price that was MUCH better quality. This was sent directly from China...I should have read reviews like this one. Thanks
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|We did not watch season one or two, as the ones we watched were stilted,  but the series keeps getting better, with unusual and different plots each week.

B008KE3960|4.0|I liked the game and found it enjoyable to play for a few minutes but I uninstalled it since it took quite a bit of space on my device and I prefer some of the other tower defense games that are available. I didn't feel like the game developed quickly enough and was a challenge. I did like how you can setup routes for your planes to fly and it keeps it interesting like a strategy game but overall I think there are some areas to improve this app. the graphics and performance of the app were great but I just wasn't hooked enough to keep playing it.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Love it, they are such talented guys and very inspirational. Recommend to everyone, classics as well as new are covered
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|This app was disappointing and did not have the ease of use or feature set that i was looking for. I uninstalled it almost immediately after installing it for the first time.

B004GYY714|5.0|Great app and a must have for all radio lovers.<br />I'm using on my Kindle Fire HD and it works perfectly.<br />I don't normally take the time to rate apps but this one is one of those that really stand out head and shoulders above the rest!<br />One of my all time favorite apps!
B000FC13MM|3.0|Based upon the glowing reviews for this book, I was ready to love it... Unfortunately I was disappointed.  To me the characters seemed two-dimensional and undeveloped. The love story was trite. I'm going to pass on the rest of the series.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is so much fun.  Do yourself a favor and read it.  I am anxious for her next work to be published.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Page turner all the way. Another good one , Mr Grisham 5 stars for this book. Waiting for the movie
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great app that has every version of the Bible you'll ever need! Although we have wi-fi in our church, I love that there are many downloadable versions to use off-line. The only problem that I've encountered is that there are times when the app freezes when launching. I have a HP Touchpad that has CynagenMod 9 (Android 4.0) on it. I don't know if this maybe the cause of the issue, which I don't think should be and it doesn't happen too very often.
B0019IIPXQ|4.0|I wasn't particularly impressed. It was a little boring or slow at times, but other than that, it's pretty good. No complaints except for that. If you like science fiction, I recommend this movie to you.
B004GJYROG|5.0|This movie is such a classic.  What other movie combines Michael Jordan, the NBA, and Looney Toones? It's so funny.
B00285K1KE|4.0|I'm not a previous Hulk fan - in fact, I knew virtually nothing about the Hulk until I watched this movie.<br /><br />I thought this movie was great. The screen splits were a little weird at times, but other than that, there was nothing to complain about, in my opinion. The story's great, the acting's pretty good, and the effects were good. If you're just looking for an entertaining movie about a super hero, I highly recommend this to you.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I forgot how much I liked this movie.  It has subtle creepiness and just gets under your skin and makes you keep thinking about it for hours.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This movie turned out to be quite entertaining. It totally surprised me. I highly recommend if you're even thinking about watching it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you, Stephen, for this book!  I was always wondering what might have become of little Danny when he grew up.  Abra<br />was the perfect co-protagonist.  I wish them both well.  Maybe another sequel would be worthwhile when Abra grows up.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of a short list of books I've practically thrown at friends and begged them to read... except I got the digital version and wasn't about to break my phone by throwing it anyone. Worth reading. If it doesn't suck you in by the first chapter, maybe it isn't for you. Me? I couldn't put it down after the first page.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This is my favorite movie all time.  I bought this for my lady friend in hopes it would bring us closer together.  I am a romantic, and this movie is loaded with steamy romance.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Really cool game. Keeps me occupied. Plays better with a stylus pen! Hate the sound though. I play it on silent.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Excellent album. Alter Bridge always deliver. Whoever thought this band would outlast Creed. Time is a funny thing. It's nice to see Brian Marshall stick around.

B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|What an impressive band. Each of their albums shows such growth. Each song is in perfect sequence. I love this group. I made the mistake of not seeing them live, but will when they come around again.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book was an interesting depiction of one &#34;chronicler's&#34; story of how humankind fought back from the brink of the apocalypse.  I thought the author as interviewer angle was different.  I liked it except that it was too clinical at times.  Since everything was past tense, there was no fear angle or much tension.  I didn't worry about any of the characters hence I didn't care about the outcome.  I guess I'm saying for a zombie book it didn't scare me and that doesn't make for a very entertaining story.

0399165274|3.0|It lacked the beautiful plotting and suspense building that Forsyth is usually known for.<br />It is jam packed full of facts about the machinations of the counter terrorism units, although one can clearly see that his heart beats fiercely for the British units. The last few chapters almost roar with male pride and Forsyth seems to come alive when he writes about those specific units.<br />Kudos to the author for not only fitting in the Somali pirates but also opening readers eyes to their ruthlessness. They always seem to be depicted in the media, as some sort of ill behaved Captain Sparrows getting their booty by kidnapping boats and people and holding them to ransom. That is some Hollywood fantasy though. The Somali pirates are murderers with financial connections to terrorist cells. They deal in weapons, currency, lives and the only thing that counts is screwing the West and making money.<br />I think the author is trying to appease his US audience with the overemphasis on the US concentrated plot. I think he writes his best when he writes with a focus on Brits.<br />There is little dialogue and a lot of facts. Full of dry descriptions and technical details, which kind of take the thrill out of the thriller.<br />I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing you have to played it now I can play with my friends and get coins for this and I love their new outfit
059306495X|4.0|At about 700 pages it sure is a humdinger of a thriller with a political flavour to it.<br />The first few chapters were really good. the crime scene scenario description was intricate and eerily precise. In fact throughout the book the screenwriter in the author is very evident. The locations and settings are so specific and vivid that the only thing missing is someone with a camera calling action or cut. At times I thought it was to the detriment of the actual storytelling because now and again it was a little drawn out.<br />The setting is like a classic Bond. You have the ultimate villain bent on destroying the US and his counterpart the covert spy. Mixing in themes such as the terrorism threat and Islam fanatics that are a part of our era gives the story an edge that people can relate to.<br />The terrorist threat described in this book is very realistic, to the point of Hayes obviously knows how to think like a criminal. Not sure if that is a compliment or not, but that aspect of his creativity is also evident in his depiction of crime scenes. Very meticulous and with a painstaking eye to each element.<br />Overall I think it could have done with less description and length. It would still have been a good read.<br />I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.

B00ACP3OOM|5.0|I use this to practice my synchronized swimming routines.  Works very well.  My only issue is that it's hard to pause and restart when you can't see it because it's on the back of your head.  I've had to remove it at times to get it going again.  I have to play more with the settings to get that worked out.
098478280X|1.0|This book obviously became a cult and spreads a very dangerous trend. Now (in autumn of 2013) a great deal of companies follow the \\"trend\\" and the core of the interview process is the \\"white board coding\\". The usual excuse: \\"we know this is not perfect but so far there is nothing better\\". This is correct, many companies actually do not look into experience - the hiring process is largely done by fresh graduates based on white-board programing.<br /><br />In some cases I was interviewed by people who had no experience in the area I would be working with - but in lieu of that experience they tried to judge my skills based on how I would solve some ad-hoc generic programing task at whiteboard.<br /><br />The entire situation resembles the scene in \\"The Tragedy of Man\\" (\\"Ember Tragédiája\\" in original) where in an utopian communist-like society Michelangelo's job was to crank out chair foots. The difference is, the companies try to find a Michelangelo by giving candidates a task to make 150 chair foots. In (one of) my native languages I would say: \\"Michelangelo kompetenciáját nem székláb faragással kell lemérni\\" (i.e. in English: \\"the compentency of Michelangelo should not be measured by his ability to make chair foots\\").<br /><br />Besides the above fundamental problem (understand, the author is a messenger only, the root cause is the completely broken hiring system) the coding questions within the book are often with sloppy wording and some of the solutions are straight incorrect or a better algorithm can be found.<br /><br />Let's start with the very first question:<br /><br />\\"Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?\\"<br /><br />- The wording of the question is somewhat sloppy, \\"unique character\\" could be mistaken with \\"special character\\"<br />- Solution #1: length of the string is being calculated = slow. Unnecessary allocation = slow.<br />- Solution #2 is totally incorrect. Non-US-English characters are ignored. Will not even work with my name!<br /><br />Correct implementation is like #2 but using 256-bit unsigned integers to hold the bitmap.<br />(Obviously, the coder has to implement the 256-bit integers first and some bit manipulations on them).<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />So is it a useful book to read? By all means, yes, here I give it five stars easily. It is very useful to polish your skills if you are preparing for a job interview in 2013.<br />Is it a book useful for humankind? Absolutely, no. It's one of the most harmful books for the software industry, both thumbs down.<br /><br />Some more things to think about.<br /><br />So far, no one was able to answer me the following question. You may try. Here is the question:<br /><br />\\"It is well-known the trend of white-board programing interviews did start at Microsoft and they tend to be the most hard at it. So we can assume, they hire only the best of best, who did not fail their interview process. In that case how come these bright people produce such buggy, bloated code as Microsoft is infamous about?\\"<br /><br />One of my friends told me: \\"many people just memorize the typical Microsoft interview questions, they are all over the net. Or if they have time, train for a month. They won't fail the interview but they are not good at solving the simplest real-world problems\\". If that's the case... thank you Gayle for nothing and for spreading the disease.
B008ZDC7M8|2.0|Geeeze!!! How frigging frustrating? I'm sure it's a good series, but I can't get past the stupid narrator who ends every sentence as if he is asking a question. Are there no professional narrators anymore? It's such a waste of content.

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|The author Luca Rossi really can bring the various characters of the novel to life with his skillful writing style. It is a great mixture of science fiction, fantasy, human morals, erotic and some thrilling moments that are displayed in each of the short stories.<br /><br />Although I am a science fiction writer, I was totally sold to the way Luca delivers these stories. As I was reading the chapter \\"The Kingdom of Turlis\\" there are certain scenes that captures my attention. The character \\"Anna\\" really intrigued me as there was a scene of a cop's gun pointing at her husband. Without giving too much away, there are good action scenes after that.<br /><br />I have only one word for his author, WOW!. He really delivers it so well that I can't wait to read more of Luca going forward.<br /><br />John Black is the author of [[ASIN:B00DQCC642 Quincy 2116 - (A Space Exploration Sci-Fi Thriller Novel)]] and [[ASIN:B00F10UYOQ Project Mimic - (A Sci-Fi Action Thriller Novel)]].
B004GXKBFQ|4.0|This live action Peter Pan film has been often crticized for being way over the top with its reliance on computer generated special effects. It's true that at times it can be a little overwhelming but ultimately doesn't distract from storyline about the boy who never grows up.  Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villian Captain Hook and is a treat to watch.  Sure the film has its flaws but at its core  remains good, fun, family friendly filmaking.

B00ER23V1W|4.0|There has never quite been a film like Gravity. In terms of plot, it's fairly thin - two astronauts, played by George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, suffer a disaster while repairing the Hubble space telescope, and are left floating stranded in space, desperately trying to find a way to safety, and to home. Instead, it is the scope and majesty of Alfonso Cuarón's film that takes audiences to a completely new sensory place. Space has never seemed so vast, so vivid, so beautiful, so terrifying. The cinematography and design of the film makes the viewer feel like it was genuinely shot in space, such is the sense of realism. Much more will be written about the film to convey how stellar it is, but I'm here to talk about the music, which also plays an enormous part in the success of the entire project.<br /><br />The score for Gravity is by English composer Steven Price, and this is the second of his two major scores in 2013 (the other being the comedy The World's End) - truly his breakout year. Price is a guitar player by trade, who first cut his teeth in the film scoring world working with Trevor Jones on scores such as Dinotopia and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. A sideways move into music editing led him to working with composers as varied as Howard Shore, Anne Dudley, Patrick Doyle, Hans Zimmer and David Arnold - not a bad pedigree! - before he made his feature composing debut in 2011 with the British sci-fi comedy Attack the Block. With these two scores in 2013, and Gravity in particular, Price has announced himself as major new talent in the film scoring world with a bright future ahead of him.<br /><br />Price's major problem in scoring Gravity was self-imposed. As space is a vacuum, and as there is no sound there, and in order to make the film as realistic as possible in that respect, director Cuarón kept the sound effects to an absolute minimum - meaning that Price, to compensate, had to both convey the film's emotion through music, while also providingsome of the sound effects elements. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Price said \\"Cuarón was only interested in allowing sounds that the astronauts would hear themselves. You'd hear stuff within their spacesuits; if they touched something, you'd hear the vibration that they'd hear, but you don't hear any exterior noises. We kind of knew the music would be responsible for all the other things. I was asked to try and tonally represent things that would ordinarily be sound. You don't hear an explosion in the film, but you might hear some pulsation in the music that reflects it. The score is doing the job of traditional sound, while the sound crew was able to do an interesting job on their own\\".<br /><br />The end result of all this is a score which treads a fine line between being traditional film music, and being a dissonant effects track, and under normal circumstances this is a kind of score that I would tend to shy away from. However, for some reason, Gravity is different. The music has a compelling, fascinating aura that captures the attention, not with traditional themes and melodies - although there are some of those - but instead with a challenging collision of sounds and styles that draws the listener in. Some of the sounds are enormous and overwhelming - the electronic pulse that opens the score in \\"Above Earth\\" is simply ear-shattering - but these are tempered by some beautiful, almost celestial spacey ambiances accompanied by the merest hint of a solo vocal and an electric cello. This is the wonder of Earth, as seen from high above.<br /><br />The two-note electronic pulse, ominous and persistent, accompanies every bad thing that happens to Bullock and Clooney, from the devastating disaster as the \\"Debris\\" hits, to the terrifying blackness of \\"The Void\\", and the breathless energy and sense of panic in \\"Don't Let Go\\". The opening 20-plus minutes of the score are very much rooted in this dark, oppressive style, and listeners will find these cues arethe most challenging, and the most difficult to swallow in terms of conventional `enjoyment'. The electronic tones build and overlap and swirl around each other in frightening ways to the point of sheer cacophony, although the voices and the cello are never too far away to keep the listener grounded in the human world. The action returns later in the score in the frantic and frenzied pair \\"Fire\\" and \\"Parachute\\"; the latter of these two is especially notable for the cracking cello ostinati and unexpected flutter-tongued brass triplets that really help raise the sense of urgency.<br /><br />The first hint of anything remotely hopeful begins to appear in the first portion of \\"Don't Let Go\\", which retains the same orchestration and electronic palette as before, but twists things around to make the stark tones of the electric cello and the soulful, plaintive vocals into a forlorn lament speaking of loss and self-sacrifice. Later, \\"Airlock\\" features a peaceful piano solo - a moment of calm amongst the chaos. Subsequent cues such as \\"ISS\\", \\"Aurora Borealis\\", the blissful \\"Aningaaq\\", and the gossamer-light \\"Soyuz\\" also continue the trend with dreamy, swooning ambiences that are very appealing indeed.<br /><br />The score's finale, comprising the cues \\"Tiangong\\", \\"Shenzou\\" and \\"Gravity\\" and running for just over 16 minutes, is where Price finally allows the thematic presence and emotional content to rise to the fore and shine at its fullest. \\"Tiangong\\" and the first half of \\"Shenzou\\" are all about painful, desperate anticipation, as Price gradually but relentlessly raises the tension levels through stepwise changes in key and gradual layering of vocals over acoustic instruments over electronics. The soaring vocal effect and increased melodic performance of the orchestra in the cue's second half, and in the conclusive \\"Gravity\\", bring blessed relief, sounding almost like something Ennio Morricone might have written on one of his more emotional days, perhaps recalling the vigorous anthem-like statements at the end of Queimada or The Mission. It's a wonderfully powerful and compelling - and human - conclusion to such an other-worldly story, and it's perhaps telling, and appropriate, that the closer the film gets to Earth, the more prominent the voices of those souls upon it become in the score.<br /><br />Gravity is not a score which will appeal to the masses. A large part of it is made up of challenging, uncompromising electronic dissonance, and if that sort of music leaves you running for the hills, then you can expect to be going there after listening to the first 15 minutes of this score. Similarly, anyone who immediately expects space music to be grand and symphonic, á la Holst, will also be disappointed; this is not that kind of score, and it would have overwhelmed and undermined the film if Price had gone down that road. What more adventurous listeners will find instead is a bold, difficult, enchanting score by a talented newcomer which scares and crushes the listener as much as it entertains, but builds to a rousing and cathartic finale.

B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Cath Avery is not your typical college freshmen. True, she's got all her books ready and is all set up in a perfectly good dorm room (complete with one sarcastic roommate) but Cath is not pleased at being separated from her twin sister Wren. Her much more outgoing, prettier twin sister (in Cath's mind) Wren. But that's okay. She's got special permission to take an upper-level fiction writing course, boxes of protein bars to sustain her, and her Simon Snow fanfiction to occupy her time. So what if the majority of her friends are either online or only live in books? She can handle this split from her sister and her scatterbrained dad. She can. Only what happens when life really starts to come crashing down on Cath? Can she figure out without losing herself?<br /><br />Fangirl is something special. Okay, Cath is something special. I can't remember falling so hard for a character in such a long time. How can I even quantify it? Cath is neurotic in the best way possible. She's a genius that could have just moldered away her entire freshman year if it weren't for her world-wise roommate Reagan whose mission in life (alongside the smiling Levi) it is to drag Cath out into wide world. And it goes without saying that anytime Levi graced the pages you can be sure I sat up just a bit straighter. Take this scene where he (and Reagan) meet Wren for the first time.<br /><br />\\"Hey, Cath,\\" he said, already smiling, \\"are you--?\\" He looked at the bed and stopped.<br />\\"Levi,\\" Cath said, \\"this is my sister, Wren.\\"<br />Wren held out her hand.<br />Levi's eyes were wide as Cath'd ever seen them. He grinned at Wren and took her hand, shaking it. \\"Wren,\\" he said. \\"Such fascinating names in your family.\\"<br />\\"Our mom didn't know she was having twins,\\" Wren said. \\"And she didn't feel like coming up with another name.\\"<br />\\"Cather, Wren...\\" Levi looked like he'd just now discovered sliced bread. \\"Catherine.\\"<br />Cath rolled her eyes. Wren just smiled. \\"Clever, right?\\"<br />\\"Cath,\\" Levisaid, and tried to sit next to Wren on the bed, even though there wasn't enough room. Wren laughed and scooted toward Cath. Cath scooted, too. Reluctantly. If you give Levi an inch...<br />\\"I didn't know you had a mother,\\" he said. \\"Or a sister. What else are you hiding?\\"<br />\\"Five cousins,\\" Wren said. \\"And a string of ill-fated hamsters, all named Simon.\\"<br />Levi opened his smile up completely.<br />\\"Oh, put that away,\\" Cath said with distaste. \\"I don't want you to get charm all over my sister -- what if we can't get it out?\\"<br />Reagan walked back through the open door and glanced over at Cath. She noticed Wren and shuddered. \\"Is this your twin?\\"<br />\\"You knew about the twin?\\" Levi asked.<br />\\"Wren, Reagan,\\" Cath said.<br />\\"Hello,\\" Reagan said, frowning.<br />\\"Don't take this personally,\\" Cath said to Wren. \\"They're both like this with everyone.\\"<br /><br />Doesn't that just leave you with a smile on your face? There were so many unforgettable moments in this book. Laugh out loud moments. Cry your eyes out moments. And times when you just want to go hug your best friend moments. Rainbow Rowell manages to juggle all these different plots and ideas and underlying emotions that it simply blows my mind.<br /><br />And then there's the Simon Snow stuff. I cannot begin to tell how much I wish those books -- or Cath's Simon and Baz fanfiction -- were real. I have never wanted to read a fake book so flippin' much. Fangirl is the ultimate keeper. Cath and Levi and Reagan and Wren have all settled themselves into my heart and I just never wanted the story to end. But I think Rainbow Rowell gets that.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought one at BestBuy July 25 when they were first available. It installed easily on my Panasonic TV using my Samsung Galaxy tablet and has worked flawlessly for 2 ½ months now. My AT&T Wi-Fi internet service has never been a problem. There are 2 things I particularly like about my Chromecast:<br /><br />1. It streams Netflix without pauses. My WDTV Live box and the app built into my TV often pause to rebuffer. The Chromecast has never had a hiccup.<br />2. The Android app for Netflix on my tablet has a feature that I haven't seen on other Netflix apps: it has a slider at the bottom of the screen to tell where you are in a video and you can move it left or right to instantly go forward or back in the video. There is no hesitation like when using the fast forward or rewind buttons on a remote control.<br /><br />One thing should be emphasized: you must have Wi-Fi (wireless internet) for Chromecast to work. It does not have an Ethernet port for an internet connection. And you must be able to find your Wi-Fi password. If you haven't changed it, it is probably printed on your wireless router or in the paperwork that came with it. On my AT&T Gateway (2Wire wireless router) it's called the \\"Wireless Network Key\\".<br /><br />I don't understand why so many negative reviews complain about the limited number of applications that work with Chromecast. The specs clearly state, \\"Supports Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, and Google Play Movies and Music mobile apps as well as SELECT (my caps) content through Chrome browser\\". Why would anyone expect it to do more than this? Don't they read the specs? Or worse, do they read the specs and expect it to do more? The Chromecast does exactly what it claims and does these things extremely well.<br /><br />If you have any problems, search YouTube on your computer for \\"Chromecast\\" where you will find lots of videos on setup and use of the device.<br /><br />I love Chromecast and have just ordered another one (from Amazon this time) for a second TV.

B007VDN1PA|2.0|First the good. I bought this to scan in a bunch of old slides from 30-60 years ago. I already had an HP PhotoSmart scanner but at minute or more per slide it was not acceptable. This device was very quick and easy to use as advertised.<br /><br />Move onto the bad.<br />The controls & menus are less than ideal but they get the job done. A couple of things like mirror & flip are quick and easy to do but others such as exposure take several clicks which could get very annoying if you have to do it often.<br /><br />And now to the unacceptably bad part.<br />Into my third roll I realized that not only weren't the images as sharp as I'd have expected, all of them were less sharp on the right side.  Testing my theory, I flipped some slides over, scanned, and saw that the previously blurred right side looked fine when it was on the left.<br /><br />I think a lot of people might not notice, just thinking \\"gramps\\" wasn't a good photographer or photos were naturally blurry in those days. But if I'm going to spend hours of my time scanning thousands of slides, ending up with a decent image is paramount. So it's all packed up and ready to be returned tomorrow.

B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is super funny! The characters are super quirky and lovable. I like that the story line is not super important so you can jump in at any time and enjoy! I do have to say as season three is coming out on cable the show loses so much of its charm when it's interrupted by commercials.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much even though I thought it was a bit long. I would never have guessed the ending which made it even better.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great graphics, story line and puzzles. challenging, varied and very fun! I would definitely recommend this game to my friends
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book when I was about 9 or 10 and instantly fell in love with the characters and the setting. An uplifting story of overcoming heartbreak with valuable life lessons sprinkled in like so many fragrant flowers in the sumptuous Secret Garden.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The second book in the bared to you series is even more intense than the first. I can't wait to see what the last book has in store! I love the psychology background ingrained  in this series as well as the twists it takes. A must read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|WOW!  What a Read.  This book came highly recommended and it met the mark.  The book was a really hard, emotional read.  I was continually going through ups and downs.  My heart broke for both the main characters, yet at the same time I was thrilled for them.  Yes this book has received a LOT of 5-star reviews and it deserves every one of them.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|This game is adorable. I love rabbits so I was glad to find this game. It's fun and I never get tired of it. Very cute.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I love this weather app. It's free and has beautiful graphics. It's similar to weather bug. I have my kindle fire next to me at night and when I wake up I can easily check what's happening outdoors. Thank you.

Can't wait for season 3 and so on if available,<br />The whole cast are awesome and at the end of one show you can't wait til the next show.<br />My one wish is that at some point I would like to see them in action in court a little more.<br />My hats off to the writers and producers. The lines, the faces, the subjects are awesome. I would give it a ten if I could.

B00D2MC8WG|3.0|Gustavo Dudamel has received, deservedly, universal acclaim for his work with the Simon Bolivar Orchestra in his native Venezuela. The social implications of the enlightened project that led to its creation have been immense, and the lessons learned have resonated throughout the world.<br />If we are brutally honest, when it comes to that particular orchestra  Dr. Samuel Johnson's famous remark about having seen a dog dancing on its hind legs is appropriate, that being\\" the issue is not how well it was done, but that it was done at all\\".<br />In an era when so many conductors are \\"faceless\\", Dudamel's engaging personality is a welcome relief, but a major component of the key to great conducting is being able to inspire the musicians to translate the personality of the conductor into their playing as much as into the interpretation.<br /><br />Any conductor who tackles Strauss tone poems in Berlin is potentially on a hiding to nothing as the spectre of Karajan hovers malevolently over the proceedings. Just as in Cleveland with Szell, no matter who conducts these works in Berlin, Karajan always gets a review!<br />Whatever one's opinion of Karajan as an interpreter, it is beyond question that his performances of Strauss were infused with HIS personality, which was manifested in the intensity of the playing, each individual note being played through and an atmosphere of tension relieved by ecstasy particularly in Zarathustra, which with Don Quixote is the most challenging of the Strauss tone poems to bring off, needing careful balancing between darkness and light and especially careful avoidance of the traps that can lead to musical longeurs.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that the word to best sum up this performance of Zarathustra is flaccid.<br />I find it devoid of energy, inspiration and for me-interest. I have waited for some time to compile this review, as I have returned many times to this recording to ensure that I was not affected by temporary mood etc, but each repeat hearing has reinforced my conviction.<br />From the very opening, the mystery and grandeur of the sunrise are totally absent, and if this fails to grip, things are bad indeed. There is a lethargy about the whole performance which has infected the players, and the playing sounds to me as if the orchestra was uninvolved.<br /><br />The passage described as \\"Von der Wissenschaft\\" seems interminable as the fugue drags on, and the Tanzlied lacks spring and liveliness. It's not just the slow tempi-that can work as Tennstedt demonstrates in his gripping recording with an inspired LPO-it's the lack of energy and inspiration not being conveyed to the players.<br /><br />Of course, the Berlin Philharmonic plays with flawless accomplishment and the recording is very good though there is some opaqueness in more congested passages, and it is not demonstration class, so on a superficial level it is a pleasing experience.<br />The Zarathustra is not dreadful-but it IS dull and to me that is unforgiveable.<br /><br />A similar state of affairs pertains to the 2 fillers which are at best routine and competent. The Don Juan totally fails to arouse any excitement; Till Eulenspiegel is a dull fellow whose pranks fall flat.<br />Again, very well played and recorded and pleasant enough but not inspiring.<br />I can imagine the Spectre of Karajan thumbing its nose in the manner of Petruchka over the whole proceedings.<br /><br />Karajan was a master of these works, particularly Zarathustra with 4 commercially released CDs, plus DVD and \\"unofficial\\" recordings. For me his finest performances are the Decca VPO recording, stunning in the 24 Bit re-mastering made in Japan which can be had as an import at huge expense, and his live Salzburg BPO performance released on Testament, but obviously his re-mastered Digital recording is sonically the best. Conventional wisdom has the 1970's performance on Originals as the best choice, and indeed it was BBC Radio 3's Critics Choice as Best Overall Choice in 2012. They are all superb.<br />My own top recommendations besides the Karajan recordings are the aforementioned Tennstedt contained in an astonishing bargain box, Previn with the VPO on Telarc which is not just artistically superior but sonically also and both Digital Recordings by Maazel are superb-the VPO recording coupled with a superb Sinfonia Domestica and Dolby Surround recording with the BRSO a very different reading, with a transparency and chamber-like approach which is revelatory in many passages and with glorious climaxes juxtaposed.<br />Famous performances by Reiner, Ormandy and Steinberg are all excellent but not in the very best of sound comparatively.<br />For Don Juan and Till, Reiner and Solti both with the CSO are hard to beat and if you want an eccentric view of Don Juan, Klemperer shows how slow tempi can be effective when an inspirational conductor is on the podium (it's actually my favourite performance and the recording and playing are superb!)<br />I'm afraid that to my ears, and not just in this recording, there is an element of \\" Emperor's New Clothes\\" about the work of Dudamel-I find his Mahler unlistenable, with his performance of the Second in London absolutely stultifying-I hope it does not get Resurrected in any form. (Sorry!)<br /><br />The good that this conductor has done on a social level and in bringing great music to a wider and unlikely audience is immense, and I wish him well and  am mindful that he is young and could well mature into a really fine artist.<br />Here I have to advise on this recording, and I would not recommend it to any but his ardent fans and those who cannot resist any recordings by the BPO.<br />I would award 2 stars for performance, but the recording and playing are  good with a wide dynamic range (though no SACD) so a generous 3 stars.<br />Stewart Crowe.all Choice in 2012.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This series started out slowly but didn't take long at all (within first hour) to put my wife and I under its spell.  The character's individualities have developed steadily thoughout the first season, which we have just finished, and cannot wait to get started on the next (probably tonight).  The storyline is a breath of fresh air in comparison to so much of TV today.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Success is never a simple formula and Gladwell does a great job dissecting individual success and finding hidden correlation. Love the thought process and application of critical thinking.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I am looking forward to read the next one.<br />I have read others Baldacci books and have ever being disappointed .
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|The cover is made with hard corrugated paper but is very tough. Inside you can find two discs and a full lyrics booklet.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I finally opened my dvd and it does not work. The error circle appears at the top right and does not allow you to navigate through the dvd or play it for that matter. I went to return the item and of course it's too late. Extremely disappointed. Would not recommend this seller.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|First time reading something of Sanderson's. Really liked it. 11 more words required because I'm too lazy to write more.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it on the big screen and bought the DVD so I could watch it again.  Cast includes some great British actors like Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, and Maggie Smith as well as some very good young actors from India.  Heartwarming story that especially appeals to middle-aged adults.
B00000DGXN|5.0|It is nice to see that these Like Minds still sound as creative and as unique as ever. These are the players who first led me into jazz as a teenage fan and player. They are still at the top of my list. I would love to see more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is great. They don't hand out the awards it received, and despite being nearly 30 years old today, Ender's Game keeps you hooked from the moment you pick it up to the moment you put it down. I'll leave it to others to give the details, so I'll discuss the format of my reading experience. I used the Kindle version combined with the Audible version for an immersive experience. I was able to finish the book in 2 days of listening, although it could be done in 1 if you kept at it. The kindle reading was smooth and easy to follow with good controls between chapters.<br /><br />The audible version, while better than the text-to-speech, did leave something to be desired by the voice actors. There were 3 to 4 voice actors, one of which was female in the production. The main male reader had an exceptionally deep voice, and while great for characters such as Graff or Mazer Rackham, for the voice of the per-pubescent Ender, it took me out of the story at times. The experience was the same for the female reader who took on Valentine, Ender's sister. The voice was so mature, I had to keep reminding myself this was supposed to be a child around the age of 11 for much of the story.<br /><br />The transition between audio book and kindle reader was seamless when using my kindle fire, as it has the audible reader built in, but going between my iphone and kindle wasn't smooth. You had to close the audible app in order register a change in the Amazon servers so it would show up on your Kindle's appropriate reading point. This will likely be resolved with future updates as IOS 7 was only recently released and developers are playing catch up to the bugs that are found.<br /><br />Be prepared to get involved in this story. You find yourself rooting for Ender and wondering what will happen. Will he fail? What trouble will the I.F. teachers throw at him? Will humanity survive? Will he live up to his potential? Get it and find out. Yes there is a movie coming out soon, but there is so much inner monologue, that won't get captured and it's that monologue and inner turmoil that makes you root for Ender. Get it!
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I think the movie was more impressive then the book. because it was totally different plot for  TomCruise The sound effects etc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is fun for all ages.  having a great time adding new inhabitants and expanding my village and adding fun items.  Absolutely luv the volcano!''
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie was more impressive then the book. Because the music was so beautiful. Costumes actors and actresses portrade the story, thus it was most memorable
B005FISBV2|5.0|I love everything about this show! You can't watch just one! There is always something to look forward to with dexter
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My son is a serious Dr. Who fan. He loves this gadget! The only little problem--though he doesn't consider it one--is that the slide button cover fell off as soon as he opened the package. It's just a cover and doesn't affect performance. The Sonic Screwdriver can still track alien life, open any type of lock, operate computers and remotely control many other devices--fear not!<br />*just kidding, kids*
B003L77GRY|5.0|I love dexter! Got all the seasons on Bly Ray! Each season gets better and better! If you love catching the bad guys and cops this show is for you!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I got this book for my 12 year old son to read for school, but I decided to read it first.  I really liked it because I knew my son could relate to it, but it also made me realize some things as well.  It is written in a way that kids will understand which I think helps keep them interested.  The story in itself is great, I think everyone should read it!
B004LROUNG|5.0|John does a superb effort in keeping the reader glued to this book. You will enjoy this book. I guarantee it!!!!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I have watched this show several times and never seem to tire of it. Celine is a class act and I would love to see her live in this show someday!! Many thanks.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|...but his portrayal in this movie made me a believer. He's more rough-hewn than pretty boy Pierce Brosnan and more akin to Timothy Dalton, albeit without the smirk. In any event, Craig has the gravitas to pull-off the role with zero doubt, unlike Brosnan, who was cool, but he sometimes seemed to struggle in the role; Craig, by contrast, is utterly convincing.<br /><br />Let's face it, James Bond movies are not deep films. They may have convoluted plots, but there's little character depth and no heavy subtext commenting on the human condition. They're spy thrillers with an ultra-cool protagonist, beautiful women, spectacular locations, amazing gadgets, intrigue and action. That's it. Yet they're very entertaining, which is why the series has been such a hit since 1962 when \\"Dr. No\\" was released.<br /><br />But, again, with the exception of \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" (1969), there's very little, if any, character depth. Take James himself: Women to him are only meaningful as (1.) a sexual dalliance or (2.) a means to fulfill his mission. I mention this to point out that \\"Casino Royale\\" (2006) boldly changes this. The film has character depth and shows why Bond is the way he is. For instance, there are a couple amazing conversations between James and his potential babe in the story, Vesper (Eva Green), and they're full of insights. The dialog is snappy & intriguing and the performances are right-on.<br /><br />By the way, someone complained that all the women in Bond flicks are loose and willing to sleep with any man at the drop of a hat. No, they're just willing to sleep with James Bond at the drop of a hat, lol. I'm not saying it's right, but it does reflect the exciting charisma of Mr. Bond.<br /><br />There are some cool action sequences, like the long, unrelenting chase after the title credits, but there are also some quality dramatic stretches. For instance, the main poker match at the casino is excellently staged and suspenseful.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" strikes me as a mixture of the first half of \\"Goldfinger\\" with the serious tone of \\"The Living Daylights\\" & \\"Licence to Kill\\". Don't expect the comic booky approach of \\"You Only Live Twice\\" or the outlandish (and sometimes goofy) elements of \\"Moonraker\\".<br /><br />The film was shot in the Czech Republic, Venice, Bahamas and England and runs 144 minutes.<br /><br />GRADE: A-e\\" strikes me as a mixture of the first half of \\"Goldfinger\\" with the serious tone of \\"The Living Daylights\\" & \\"Licence to Kill\\".

B00FHAB3HW|5.0|You can really tell that Miley took her time on this album. Its so good its a perfect blend of party music, love songs, and feel good music. A+ for Miley!
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|I had expected a bit more music in this film, we all know Liberace was gay, so what, big deal.  I think this film was just made to give Michael Douglas a big shove.<br />Not worth the money!
