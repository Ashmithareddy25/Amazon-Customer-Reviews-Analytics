B00CDFWJIG|4.0|Although this movie was not like the book, I thought it was a really good watch. I really enjoyed the dialogue between each cast member and would recommend people watch it for its charm not because it's a book-to-movie. If you have never read the book then you will most likely find the movie to be interesting enough on its own to merit seeing it, but if you have read the book you will most likely not like it based on the fact that it is not exactly like the book. Just pretend it's not a book-to-movie and you will probably find something you like about it.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This movie is very strange and it holds your attention. I enjoyed it very much. I had debated on whether or not to rent it but I am glad I did. Definitely worth a watch.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|it is ok but what the point this game because all you are doing g is trying beat your score<br />but I kind of like this game but is ok
0375703764|2.0|Too fractured. Can't get into it.  Doesn't keep my attention. If you enjoy constantly jumping back & forth in a story, go for it.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|This product is definitely a must if you want a realistic experience while keeping it affordable! A must for any flight sim! My only complaint is the programming software from saitek. It is extremely buggy and never works right. Digging into others reviews on this software I learned im not the only one with problems however this software is not needed to use the throttle quadrant or any of the saitek pro flight gear.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|Felt like &#34;Sleeping With the Enemy&#34; all over again! Oops! I love the Carolina's and Nick Sparks and am very glad to finally have a happy ending.
B000O599XK|5.0|Got this for my Dads birthday and learned how much he loves this movie.<br />He was actually really interested in all of the extra commentary and production notes.<br />This is the best version of this movie you can get, because it contains commentary and extras<br />that my dad never heard or new about, and he is a big fan.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Here is another fine book of  British spy landscape by one of my favorite authors. The characters are believable. We feel for them. The story seems true but despite the \\"no happy ending\\" trends of present day politics, there is just a bit of hope for a happy ending in which truth and justice will come to light.  It is a page turner. It did seem, when I reached the end, that perhaps he forgot to include the last 2 chapters...
B0061QD82E|3.0|The price was very good;and the packaging was great. the video was very good on graphics;but was a little disappointed on the audio sound quallity of this video;but it might be because i didn't have a home theatre  system hooked up to view it? Over all i liked the movie.
B002V091IO|5.0|A story that makes you ponder your own mortality.  It makes you realise how short life really is and that one must seize every opportunity and have as many 'golden moments' as possible.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is awesome. I love that besides the hidden object part there is always a new task to accept. this is def one of my favorites...
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is fun and quite challenging.  Still working through all the levels, takes time and it's entertaining!  Lots of variety.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A wonderful addition to the series.  Particularly enjoyable after the (in my opinion) slow and tedious previous book in the series.  Can't wait for book 6.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The facebook app for the kindle is exactly like the android phone app. I was a little disappointed that it was not more savvy but it is what it is.
B00AEBB932|5.0|The product was in good condition and the price was right. I watch this movie about once per year and needed a good copy for that.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved this book! I read it in just a few days! Very good read and I highly recommend it!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I loved the original flow game but this one better the on screen affects are a very cute touch.<br />Great alternative if you've finished the original completely as I have!
B008133MDK|5.0|This TV show is one of my absolute favorites.  Benedict Cummerbatch and Martin Freeman play off each other beautifully, and the screenwriters have written a show where the dialogue is witty and the action fast but not so fast you can't keep up with it.  It's a really great show.
B0091REZMW|2.0|. I gave it a two star rating because I don't like the games on Facebook which this game is very similar too. I don't like that it wants you to spend more money. You don't have to but you have to wait awhile before you get certain things and the pop ups. Not a bad game just not my kind of game.
B0098460O4|5.0|I find these two young people so inspiring. It doesn't matter how many times I listen to them, it brings tears to my eyes. So touching how they have stood by each other. Very rarely do you see that type of loyalty and devotion. I pray they sing together for many years to come. Thank you for bringing so much beauty into this world.
B009GCF3Q4|3.0|Basic Connelly not very good lacks his usual panache one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
6305128952|2.0|I watched this move twice and still do not understand what was so attractive to me that caused me to order it.  Still, it is worth the price and I guess I will watch it again to see if I can learn to like it more.
159420411X|4.0|If you're like me, you know Nate Silver from his great work in the political realm.  As someone who works in that realm and very much enjoys learning about how data can be used, I was excited for this book.  However, I was disappointed when I started to read it that much of it deals with issues other than politics.  Nonetheless, it's a fascinating book.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I put this into my Fuji film S7000 camera.  It is a back up for the other 2GB card that I also have. Each card holds over 1750 pictures at my 3MB setting.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|New vibes but same paramore sound. You can tell they have journey to a new type of sound and it excellent ! It gets better and better as you listen to it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This is a sad and electrifying read! I have read Nesbo before and was hooked. This one is so thought provoking it touches every emotion imaginable. Harry Hole is one of my favorite crime buster. He got all the right instincts for the job and honor you don't find in many. I won't spoil the story for anyone but needless to say the ending broke my heart.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|My music I varies from rock to top ten and so on.... this is a must have in anyone collection. Soft tunes to relax and chill with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game with great graphics.The gems are easy to earn by leveling up. Great fun for all ages!
B008393Q2O|4.0|I like this app. You can write notes on different colored 'paper'. Change the size of the text. You can write, but it's a little bit 'messy'.<br />I would like it if you could use a stylus pen instead of your finger.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game even though sometimes I was very frustrated with all the repetition and grinding. I also wish that you could slide rows and columns even when they don't match so that you can set up for future matches. A very original mashup that is greater than the sum of its parts. At the end of the game it tells you how long you spent in the dungeon. I spent five hours and seven minutes. I don't know that I would play it again but it was a lot of fun getting there over several days and it introduced me to the matching tile style of games that I normally would never play. I got it as the free app of the day for my Samsung galaxy S3.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I love it!!! It came earlier than expected in new condition!!!! The disc played without any skipping or other problems.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|What a tale!  Hyenas, tigers, and zebras! Oh my!  I was intrigued from beginning to end! A must for your summer reading list!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I rarely write reviews but this book was so great!  It was uniquely written and loved that it was Drew telling the reader his story.  Would have liked an epilogue but hopefully there will be other books so we can get a glimpse of Kate and Drew.  Highly recommend this book!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I found this app fun and addictive.  After I started playing everyone else downloaded it. I like how when u get to the last room u can go back and try for crowns .
B004JPJHME|5.0|Great piece of film and a must have for any respectable DVD collection... Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are a power duo of mayhem... Gritty, dirty, and hilariously accurate Fear and Loathing is one of the few films that gets better every time you watch it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great fit, a little difficult to set if you have large fingers. Works like a charm and looks like one also.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I installed this app but every time try to open it the GAMESLOFT screen comes and then it stops running.
B0014E9188|5.0|It's not often I get to hear a live concert sound as good as this. The band is tight, the singer tuning was incredible, the drum sound was, well, almost perfect. Porcupine tree is an inventive and innovative band, which this DVD really shows off. If you are a fan of actual music and musicianship, this is one of the best DVD's you could buy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Worth a shot if you like this kind of game.  It has very good graphics and a variety of pieces to build with.
B00991TCOG|5.0|After listening to this CD with my daughter I knew I had to have it. Lindsey Sterling has such an incredible talent. I'm so happy with my purchase.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Wonderful story!  Would highly recommend for all readers<br />The author has a way of  keeping your attention throughout the story.
B004JQN364|5.0|this reptile creature is probably the best creature in Papo mutant series.<br />its lower jaw can move up and down and it has weapons on both hands
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So much fun.... I just got the game and  am on level 8 in five minutes so much fun get its free
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The dinos are the number one attraction to the whole park. The game acts just like the #1 motion picture films, Jurassic Park; The Lost World: Jurassic Park; Jurassic Park III.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pocket Edition is great, but the computer is better. What I realized on cake that it didn't Show. But Awesome!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The first book in the Jack Reacher series is a spell-binding journey. Memorable characters and a gripping story line made this a real page turner. I can't wait to read the next one!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Can't put it down. Never the same way twice, really addicting. Well worth the money. I love this application . Thanks would love to see some more.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Whenever u first buy the game it is a lot of fun. After awhile it gets boring. It is basically like temple run the game.
B005D0TETA|4.0|But it was better heard than seen.  Thr Orchestra players and background dancers (?) were very over the top in thier actions, but the music was as great as you'd expect.  I bought this for my husband who loves Yes, but those were his comments.  He did complain a lot about the goofy, non-Yes people on stage.  A CD would have been cheaper, but husband insists I give it 4 stars.
B001RCD2DW|2.0|I bought this headphone last Oct, it came with the sound I like, but it behaved like ill from the very first day. The right ear had no sound from time to time. Original I think it could be the small mechanical problem between the headphone and my old headphone box. Few weeks ago, after spend some time to test, I figured out it's pure headphone issue. Since I already left US, I decided to fix it by myself instead send it back.<br /><br />It took some time and tricks to open the plastic cup and what I saw is a polluted inside. There were plenty of rusty-colored fine powders. I had no idea where it come from. It's not clean as I expected, but I did not dig out what they are. I focused on the signal wire and found the yellow wire and mini-XLR joint is &#34;cold soldered&#34;. After resolder it, now it output sound stably.<br /><br />I am a long-time lover of AKG. I have three pairs of AKG headphones and bought many more for my friends and relatives. But this time it make me think twice for next pair of headphone. The &#34;cold solder&#34; is not the kind of workmanship I expect with this price tag.<br /><br />Maybe I am just unlucky. But anyway, I hope my experience could help others to know what they may need to notice/check when they buy it.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I bought this wondering what the 'forty' referred to: bottles of beer on the wall, calories, etc.  after about an hour I realized it was a reference to being forty years old.  Even though I find old people gross I still liked this movie.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Excellent transfer of a classic Kubrick Film. Both video and sound quality are (as expected) far clearer than than the previous DVD releases.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It's like the old book title, &#34;You don't have to be Jewish...&#34; Inside, the answer is, &#34;Yes, but it helps.&#34; In this case, the entire movie is one big Jewish guilt trip from momma to son... like you need a movie to tell you about that! In this film, however, it's more a case of mother and son rediscovering who the other is and who they thought them to be... while taking a road trip together. So the title is a pun, a play on words. We've seen this same theme in other films, like &#34;Bridges of Madison County&#34; where the kids discover their mother is nothing like who they thought she was. Unfortunately, the film starts out so rough, it's like starting with a bad hors d'oeuvre; most people are ready to ask for the check before all the good stuff gets put on the plate. The film does improve after it first meanders around looking for a point. I could never fault Streisand. Her talent is too obvious, even when she isn't singing. She's as good an actress as the best of the them. Hear that Meryl? The problem is Seth Rogen. As a stand up comic, he's terrific. But as an actor, he has problems with screen presence... and it isn't his fault. Someone behind the camera is dwelling on him too long. He would be better in short snippets - delivering one liners instead of long speeches. The film has its moments and is good if you are a Streisand fan. Otherwise, its only mediocre at best.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would've given this game 5 stars but for the ads. But it was a free download. Good graphics. Good options. Hint and undo move features are useful.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Make some popcorn, start the movie and thoroughly enjoy every minute of it. It is good to laugh out loud which you will do with Ralph.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Master Chief, need I say more?!  The Halo movie has been talked about for years but if this is any indication of where we'll be lead, I'm ready to boot up!  Great story, awesome graphics. Everything that you'd expect from the Halo franchise.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was such an unexpected surprise... as in, I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did!!  It was a welcomed surprise too... so, so very welcome!  And after reading a few books that were merely, 'tolerable', 'okay', and 'good', this work of fiction, 'Tangled' was like a breath of fresh, country air!  Have I mentioned how much I love the country air?<br /><br />I'll spare the synopsis, there's no need to repeat what's already available.  I will tell you that 'Tangled' is written from the the male character's eyes, something that the reader doesn't get to experience very often & I think that the author nailed it! Not only was it a risk (on the author's part), it gave the book a completely different spin that we normally don't get to 'see' as a reader.  And my favorite aspect?  The humor & sarcasm.  This entire story is woven with an extreme amount of hilarity, sarcasm, and wit... in addition to romance.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is beyond brilliant.  I think that Emma Chase went above and beyond and delivered a final product that exceeds every expectation that I would want in a book.  I laughed while reading 'Tangled' until I had tears running down my face.  The writing flowed effortlessly & this was one of 'those' books that I didn't put down until I finished it.  Not only did I laugh, I cheered, I booed, and I shook my head.  Writing is supposed to evoke the emotions of the person reading it and I can honestly say that Ms. Chase did that & more with her work.<br /><br />I can't wait to read more!  Bravo, Ms. Chase, Bravo!!
1936608898|5.0|This book will provide a great Paleo road-map.  Making my own mayonnaise is something that will stick with me no matter what, and her recipe is outstanding and so easy, not to mention the salad dressing recipes.  And the zucchini aglio e olio.  And the jicama home fries.  And the scotch eggs.  And the carnitas OH MY GOSH.  So good.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|It really wasn't a scary movie, I wouldn't recommend for kids because of ghost that manipulates the children in the town somehow to die, I would say it was more of a mystery movie.  Who was the lady and why did she want the kids dead? There are flashbacks and bits and pieces that come together throughout the movie and finally at the end we think mystery solved and everything is fine...but there was an unexpected twist at the last minute.
B001KWZ796|5.0|Realistic?  No. (why would she ever climb that tree?) True to the period?  No. (she would never have said &#34;my father was addicted to the written word)  But romantic and cute.  A favorite.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is a great app I am on it all the time and it is a good way to kill time
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved the first games on the computer and then I discovered the 5th one on ninjakiwi.com. I loved the fact that they added the new towers! This game is so worth the $2.99! This is a must have! You need to get it immediately. It deserves to be on the top paid section on the app store it's way better than Minecraft. Come on let's give it some five stars people!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|what can i say? it  fun and addicting. i like it. sometimes i get dizzy but oh well. i like it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was the series I resisted. Unfinished, a &#34;must read&#34;. I stayed cleared until finally picking it up on my kindle and jumping on for the ride. I got to book 9 or 10 before hitting the limits of what was written, and having to wait for the final books.<br /><br />I won't go into the nitty gritty details, but the Wheel of Time - epic fantasy series that at times was brilliant and marvelous, and at times dragged and seemed cliched - it got the ending it deserved. A long, detailed, bloody - epic - final battle. The whole book devoted to the battle the previous books were bringing us too, and Sanderson does it proud. The last third of the book is un-put-downable.
B00597A6NU|3.0|A cute, polished film. But why did those Messerschmitts keep attacking in pairs-- to make themselves easier targets? Or did the Luftwaffe have only two left by May of 1943?<br /><br />I kept waiting to see scenes of what the bombs were doing when they hit the ground-- killing thousands real people down there-- mostly children and women. Of course it is difficult to hit a target from 10,000 feet. Those bombs aimed at that factory were just as likely to land next door on the school or the hospital. (One problem the German intelligence had with the British bombing, and the Brits bombed more than we did, was figuring out what the target city was-- not which part of the city was the target-- but which city was the target.) And of course many civilians were living in the factories, since we had already bombed them out of their homes. But maybe if we kill the civilians, they will just give up and call it quits.<br /><br />Cute film; \\"our\\" men were brave, but do read the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey, 1946, which stated that German industrial production increased greatly during the bombing.
B00BESJYAY|1.0|Wow.  I guess this was made for a targeted audience and it was good enough for them.  But a surfing movie does not have to be this cliche and poorly acted.  Maybe the surfing footage at the end, which they are inevitably leading to, is \\"awesome\\" enough to alleviate the pain and suffering at the beginning, but I don't have that kind of tolerance.  When I see a wave mushy and closing out, I kick out early.  That's what I would recommend.  I got to figure out where my dentist got his great video of real surfers doing their thing; I don't need the cheesy story line and half-baked characters.
B00008J2PG|2.0|Soundtrack was horrible.<br /><br />Wrong SS insignia was distracting-- no `SS` on right collar.<br /><br />Also distracting from the story: German soldiers in new Hollywood uniforms jumping out of trucks every 10 minutes and running around. The one-dimensional Hollywood portrayal of every German was distracting. It all screams \\"Made for TV.\\"<br /><br />Worst scene: Firing squad, Italian Army platoon. They fire wide, not wanting to kill the priest. Then SS Lt Col Kappler orders them to do their job. The Italian lieutenant pulls out his Beretta, locks and loads, aims at the priest, but doesn`t fire. Then Kappler pulls his own pistol, pushes aside the impotent Italian, and shoots the priest.<br /><br />I was not there; I cannot say what I would have done had I been there, but I am pretty sure that were I in the shoes of the Italian lieutenant, I would have called my men to present arms, load, and aim, and then, with the guns of the platoon pointing nearly at the SS officers, I would have shot SS Lt Col Kappler.<br /><br />If you want to see a great film on this subject, rent Amen. (2002):  Of its two main characters, one is based on Father O`Flaherty.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was such an eye-opening read. Gave me insight to the trials of everyday life for Afghan women. Story of unfailing love, forgiveness, and independence.
B000VUQ4HW|3.0|Disappointing due to the poor quality print and the horrible soundtrack. I think I've heard that same soundtrack in one of John Ford's Westerns, and it fit better there.<br /><br />But some of the camera shots are awesome, like the long shots down the city streets, and the one with the men carrying the coffins is chilling.<br /><br />See Werner Herzog's shot-for-shot 1979 remake of Nosferatu. And if you watch this 1922 version, turn the sound off or waaaaay down.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemos Reef offers creative gameplay for all ages, bringing back old characters like Gill and Dory, but introducing new fish and coral. This game is great for anyone who always wanted a chance to experience tree he big, blue world.
B00006JMQG|4.0|Creepy music and eerie, imaginative sets make this a classic. Look for the bizarre patterns on the floor and on the walls in the Insane Asylum. Even 50 minutes into the film, these strange surroundings have the power to impress.<br /><br />Very slow at the beginning but speeds up towards the end. Best collection of hats in any film I've seen, even better than in the film \\"Gettysburg.\\"<br /><br />My favorite setting was the city clerk office, with those odd high chairs. Title cards are agonizingly slow. You can read each one out loud 4 times. Or to yourself 10 times. One of them, I needed to, and only after the 4 readings did \\"to wn\\" look like \\"town\\" and not \\"to win.\\" Isn't it technically possible to remove all the title cards and put that same text on the film as subtitling? I am sure the filmmakers would approve of that change, and would have done it themselves if they could have.<br /><br />The \\"twist\\" ending is famous, but I didn't quite catch it, as I was also reading the newspaper, having become frustrated at the ever-so-slow pacing, and only figured it all out after reading the excellent Wikipedia article on the film.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This album is a great fusion of the differing sounds from the first and second album. I love the beats, the lyrics and...really everything about it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I always loved this movie. I can watch it over and over again. Any how. If you never seen it. Buy it!
B0058DRUV6|5.0|I got it on my Kindle and then bought the book.  The book is much easier to follow the tables and charts.
193700788X|1.0|Extremely, unsatisfying book to end this series!  The ending felt week. It was a chore just to finish reading it.
B004SRWW0C|3.0|Useful but very dated UI, could use an. Does what it says though update to the newer holo standards. Functions as advertised
B005K17RU0|1.0|I loved the earlier version. Easy to read colorful and fun to look at. This one is sn ugly mess and I am going to uninstall.  And do you a actually read the reviews, because not a single person likes it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was able to complete the game in an evening but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The graphics were beautiful and the puzzles were clever. I look forward to more!!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This was a good QT movie, wordy and very graphic, as expected. It had a QT flare from the beginging to the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found the book to be better than the movie.  The aurthor is great as well.  Hope all will enjoy as I did.  Love my kindel books.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|It was a great movie, The Hobbitses are always super. Will suggest this to others. I always love the good deals on Amazon
B003O86FMW|5.0|The books are always better than the movie.  hope you enjoy reading them as much as I did.  Great Aurthur.
B000U0O9FM|3.0|There is a couple  of things to be said about this book.<br /><br />As far as it concerns the structure of the book, be sure not to miss the afterword, where the author explains it well. Sufice to say that although not a traditional one, it has the virtue of keeping your interest without making you loose the thread very often (sometimes it does get a little confusing).<br /><br />There isn't much to say about the individual characters, aside from the main one, which I will not comment, because I don't want to spoil it.<br /><br />As far as the plot is concerned, it is interesting, and from the very beginning it grabs your attention. There are some inconsistencies, but acceptable ones.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the book, though, is how it suceeds in approaching the insatisfaction, the unhappinnes and the void in the lifes of a large portion of today's society. You don't go to a place where you will beat people up (or, even worst, be yourself beat up) if you have anything else going on in your life. There people don't.<br /><br />A lot of the fight club members call themselves the \\"waste of society\\", etc. The book talks about men who become poison because they don't know what else to be. And it is the plausibility of this feeling that gives the book its impact.<br /><br />It should be interesting to Read this book having In mind real life radical organizations, such as neonazis.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was a very good book to read. The aurthor was great on telling this story.  The book keeps you on edge and i loved it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing is a terrific series.  My wife and I always watched it when it was on originally and as reruns.  Our son gave us the DVD set for Christmas, but several of the DVDs don't work.  He paid about $200.00 for this gift.  What can we do, besides pay to replace it?  We've taken it to places that repair DVDs but they have not been able to restore them. Is there some way to contact Warner Brothers about this problem?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The movie was great.  Hope all enjoy as much as I.  The aurthor is great as well.  Loved the books and movie
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun to play with your kids. Can help teach them how to follow directions. I play along with my 6 yr old. He really loves to see what will hatch next
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way more challenging  jumping over fire sliding under things way better that the first one..<br />everyone who tries.it is up for a game.. hope you like it..
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|First thing's first, this has one of the best responding control set-ups I've used in a game. It has simple controls; you pilot a ship by touching the screen, but it works beautifully. While many games make you use a whole finger, I can control this with the edge of my fingernail. That adds a lot of control and gives you an advantage, something that helps out tremendously here when you want to move fast or edge closer to the enemy ships.<br /><br />Plasma Sky is a throwback hearkening the days of poorly pixelated enemies coming from the top of the screen, asking you fly toward them as you continually fire. It isn't one of the hundreds of cheap clones on the market, though. The enemies move fast but not too fast as you fly forward, clearing boards with different enemy sets. Sometimes they flow in lines or curve or align themselves, getting harder as the game progresses. As you move along, you can get power-ups and collect plasma that levels you up. Higher level = better guns, and power ups can be anything from a laser to a small ship flying along beside you (they remind me of multiples from Gradius, the old Nintendo game).<br /><br />There are three game types:  Hardcore, Survival, and Conquest. Hardcore means no bonuses, nothing, fly until you die. Survival is a timed match pitting you against an army of foes. Its chaos but a lot of fun. Conquest has 80 levels that you progress through, each getting a tad more difficult. The gameplay options make replayablilty great.<br /><br />I like this title a lot. Loads of fun. Definitely one of the best in this field.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game was amazing! Only one flaw though. It will sometimes reset your game but that was no biggie. This game was amazing and you should buy it right now.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|All time classic movie.  Great for laughs and a night in to just sit back and enjoy the epic sillyness this movie brings.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good graphics and overall fun game but I wish we can turn off all the &quot;helpful hints&quot; because it's annoying after you know what you're doing
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|If you like Andrea Bocelli's music you will enjoy this new CD. I so enjoy listening to his music. Having visited Italy for a month it brings back fond memories of my visit.
B00271HAK8|5.0|No wonder it's a classic.<br />I used Amazon prime and watched it through my xbox.  Great quality - no buffering.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is an inviting book to read. Anyone with interest in this type would get a lot of reading information.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is Awesome fun! Very challenging!  We are looking forward to each nose chapter. Super clever.  It's good to get the kids working together on it.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling skies is highly additive.  Love the twists and turns!  Had to watch season 1 & 2 to get caught up on the upcoming season.
B002N8A14M|5.0|stays on my arm, doesn't hurt. bought one for my dad (huge arm) and I (tiny arm). I even keep my ipod in the plastic clip for protection. just have to make sure your headphones can plug in okay without the plastic getting in the way. all my straight ended plugs have worked no problem.
0385486804|5.0|To avoid repeating what so many others have already said about the facts of this tragic case, I will just say that in my opinion, this book is as much a statement about society as a study of Chris McCandless's ill fated actions.<br /><br />Jon Krakauer presents a unique and quite fascinating account of the many subtle psychological and sociological factors which may have influenced this unusual young man, and I think he did it very well.<br /><br />I don't think it is possible to put him into any category. He was true to himself, and above the petty judgments of others, so quick to call him names, who nevertheless fall short of Chris's boundless courage and his idealism.<br /><br />I believe that in time McCandless will become an icon for other idealistic young men who are sensitive to the call of the wild, and feel the spiritual impoverishment of our society. Many are sensitive to that mystic call.
B004Y6MU6S|5.0|I first got into  Sanderson's work after reading the end of the Wheel of Time series. Being his first epic fantasy venture, I expected it to be solid but not live up to Robert Jordan's work. I've got to say I was mistaken; This looks to surpass Wheel of Time if it continues to be as gripping as the first book was. I don't want to spoil anything for those who are considering reading this or not, but I'll say you should go for it! You won't regret it I promise.
0375812024|4.0|I like this book for the education aspect of the contents.  It describes the airport comparing it to a little city. There are illustrations that break down parts of the airplane and what they are called along with the people and other vehicles and equipment that can be found at the airport. It packs a lot of information on each page with colorful characters.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|Well written and interesting.  I have recommended this book to family members.  This book gives the science behind the recommendations which I appreciate from a scientist's point of view.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Tangled. It was hot, funny and emotional all in one. I also love the bird's eye view perspective from Drew. Drew and Kate were so perfectly matched in every way. Now, the only reason I gave 4 stars, not 5, was how he kept referring to other women, even after he met Kate. I get WHY, being a guy and all, but it just annoyed me, but not THAT much. Tangled is pretty much one of my two favorite books (the other is Beautiful Bastard). I would HIGHLY recommend!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great read. Funny and technical at the same time. Excellent sci-fi. Well done and incredibly creative. I really enjoyed this book.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Shipping and the packaging was fine, but the Blueray copy won't play without stalling and stopping. I thought it might be my player, but when I loaned it out it did the same thing for someone else.i have not tried to return it for a replacement, so I can't blame the seller.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I downloaded this for my Grandson however I cannot stop playing it.  VERY entertaining for any age group.  Oops and yes he loves it too!!!
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|It is exactly  what the preview shows. Action, corny lines and gruesome witches. I was not disappointed, it made me giggle and cringe.
B004LUS390|5.0|I can go anywhere with this. Very efficient, can create really cool works, awesome features, right cost matches right level.
0345535421|3.0|So we ended \\"Thrones\\" with everyone at each others throats and war imminently around the corner... and then we get \\"Clash\\" which brings the action back to a screeching halt and we go back into preparation mode.  I could forgive the snails pace plot of \\"Thrones\\" since it was the introduction to the world and was building the plot.  But there is a certain expectation that once the world is built, we are going to go somewhere.  It took forever for any fighting (or \\"Clash\\") to occur and once King Renly finally is ready to fight, he get killed quite literally out of the blue, in the most bizarre way possible.  Yes, there are small skirmishes throughout the book and a major battle at the end, but I expected more.  (To those of you who quit in the first two-thirds of the book - you missed most of the action!  Eventually, things do happen if you have the patience to get there.)<br />  The story seemed a bit drawn out.  I think it could probably be edited to 2/3 of its size and it would have been a much more polished, better paced story.  I do agree with the common complaint - a mountain of detail does get a little tedious.  I think there was more room for mundane descriptions in the first but it gets a little out of place in the sequel.<br />  To those of you who complained about the violence and rape in \\"Clash\\" - well after what happened in \\"Thrones\\", did you expect anything different in \\"Clash\\"?<br />  Not to make it sound all bad - I still enjoyed the book very much.  It was well written (aside from the occasional dissertations of mundane detail.)  I was much more familiar with the characters from the first book, so it was much easier to keep track of them in \\"Clash\\".  And I am hooked on the story itself.<br />  Bottom line - It wasn't the greatest book, but it wasn't bad enough that I don't want to keep going with the series.  I press onward to \\"Storm\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome I love the survival mode! The only thing to make it better is the 0.6.0. I recommend this game to anyone it's worth the price :)
B008PNBU30|5.0|This was on my niece's wish list for Christmas. She loved the CD and spends hours listening to it. I liked the fast delivery.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|This book has it all! One of my favourite books - love, history, politics - I didn't want it to finish!
B008G59IKO|5.0|This was on a Christmas wish list. My niece loves the CD and spends hours listening to it. Very fast delivery...especially at Christmas time.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|I'm sorry but I cannot stay silent, hoping beyond hope that the current television audience is able to pro-actively understand the relatively light symbolism and allegory present in LOST. It's obvious after reading several 'reviews' here that the majority of viewers have certain expectations with their shows that aren't being met, such as trite, obvious, expected, and stereotypical plot arcs and elements. People nowadays tend to think less independently and prefer to have ideas forced on them, allowing no interpretation. I don't blame the actual individual viewers, but the shallow level that television and cinema have become in the last decade due to social expectations and 'standards.' In the last 3 years, we have mind-numbing drivel such as Jersey Shore, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, Fast and Furious, Transformers, any 'reality' shows including Gypsy Wives, Lizard-lick Towing, the list unfortunately goes on and on. The trend is show more! think less. No one wants to find personal meaning and actually look for the symbolism through research or common sense. THIS is why LOST was mostly lost on viewers.<br /><br />For example, I keep hearing needless bitching about unanswered plot threads, like the giant stone statue that Jacob makes his home or the death of the birthing mothers on the island. BOTH questions are resolved in the show by giving just enough information for the viewer to figure things out on their own IF they choose to be pro-active and find the answers independently.<br /><br />The statue is facing the bearing one needs to sail away and escape the island, but also faces the ocean as a symbolic/mystical ward against foreign threats or a beacon/location indicator like the Colossus of Rhodes. The statue is created in the obvious form of the Egyptian goddess Taweret.<br /><br />The Egyptian goddess Taweret was seen as a deity of protection in pregnancy and childbirth. When the statue was destroyed by the Black Rock, that was the start of a period whenwomen were not able to live through pregnancy on the island. It would also explain why it was shown with its legs spread in an earlier flashback and together in another -- because it needed to be rebuilt at an earlier point as well to prevent the demise of the island's civilization. She was often depicted carrying an ankh, the symbol of life, or a knife (Jacob and his knife at the beginning...), to symbolize protection from evil spirits.<br />Tawaret was a household goddess, of the sort commonly worshipped in the home but largely absent from monumental architecture and 'high' temple religion. It would have been highly unlikely that the Egyptians would have normally built a monumental statue to Tawaret, the goddess did not even have any formal temples. But given the fertility problems on the Island and the fact that the Egyptians believed in sympathetic magic, it is possible that they constructed the statue to ward off demons and spirits associated with infertility. This is given further credence by the fact that Tawaret was already an apotropaic deity. She was depicted as a hippopotamus because that animal was particularly feared and deadly in Egypt, and thus was seen as a suitably formidable protector of pregnant women and their babies. The Statue is also unusual in that Tawaret was normally depicted with exaggerated features of pregnancy, a distended stomach and pendulous breasts, which were absent in the Statue. Perhaps this is symbolic of the Island's issues with fertility.<br /><br />See? The answers everybody seeks is already within the symbolsm! Current audiences are just too lazy to bother to do a little research. Don't blame the writers, blame what sells, which is shallow, cookie-cutter shows where the creators hold your hand throughout.
B0094D462M|5.0|It's got one of the best classic rock soundtracks on top of lots of amazing movie quotes so by my standards this movie kicks ass. I've seen it dozens of times bc it never gets old
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love this game! I have been interested in it for a while, and I finally got it. This game will please all ages.<br />Feeding Om Nom and his ancestors provides challenging but nonetheless entertaining fun. I love the way how the levels are separated into different sections so you can easily stop and start the game. Definitely worth the buy!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|yes pride and prejudice more than exceeded my expectations!! I love that movie it literally gives a sense of what life was like before! Jane Austen had a gift for capturing life moments, truly gifted young lady!! I watch this movie over and over! Simply love It...
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I have watched this movie countless times and it never fails to make me laugh! The superb voice cast, nostalgic game references and fantastic plot are all just absolutely amazing.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|My wife, an avid reader, recommended this book to me.  I'm very happy she did.  I rate this book in the top ten books I have ever read.  McKenna's ability to develop the lovable characters makes this a reader's gem.  It is a real page turner with great humor and heartache from chapter to chapter.  What a gifted writer Christina McKenna truly is.  My wife and I LOVED this book and have recommended it to all of our reader friends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent excellent excellent! Can't wait to read the last book. Holding my breath for the movie. I only hope the film makers can do this book justice.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Harold is a great character who finds resolution to his life's tragedy by moving one foot ahead of the other. His attempt to reach a dying friend is heroic in nature and is impelled by his belief that if he can make this singular movement he can save her. A novel of faith and finding one,s way.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've never seen anything like this in my life. Outstanding is not good enough!!<br />You need to start the journey of your gaming life.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|great
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I don't write many reviews, but this game deserves my time!!  No one can say anything bad about this one.  It's fun, the controls work, it's not too hard and not too easy to play.<br /><br />A real blast...what others say is true...it's got Galaga, Galaxians, Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Centipede all wrapped up in one!  Throw in a little Defender, and Star Castle and you'd have the entire '80's in one game!!!<br /><br />Glad it was FOTD, but if you missed it....BUY IT!!  :-)
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Vividly described. I know each character and could recognize them in a trice. Abrupt ending left me wanting more. I even looked for a potto peel pie recipe (found one in you tube) and won't be eating THAT any time soon!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Ms Sandberg's message is important. Women have advanced in the work world but are not good at standing up for themselves in pursuing their careers. Standing up should be done with the goals in mind -- better to do it in a way that appeals to and reaches those whom one negotiates with. I'm retired but her message relates to me during my working life.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Our main character Victoria, a child raised in the foster care system, is now 18 and on her own.  This story delves into her childhood, the trauma, the emotional damage and her inability to bond. The story takes us from past to present and back again so that we understand Victoria and how she finally overcomes this damage with  the help of her knowledge of flowers, a few good friends and the love of a good man.
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|Had trouble staying awake on this after reading the book before the movie.  Think it would have been much better if the script followed the book
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Lots of action and Robert Downey Jr was great!  Not much like the books I've read but we enjoyed the movie!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I was not troubled by some of the seemingly negative reviews, contrarily I thoroughly enjoyed Wallander as depicted in this novel.  It's sad to get old and feel useless or as I've said before, IRRELEVANT to the dynamics of life around us.  But (God I hate this cliche') \\"that's life.\\"  And Mankell's skillful handling of this story about a former high ranking naval officer at the end of not only his career but of his life was particularly conscience grabbing.  Mankell's work, transcribed for us in English, glittered.  Don't miss any of the Kurt Wallander novels.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this book. The writing is excellent and drew me quickly into the story. I appreciated the natural, unforced description of time and place, and more than once I lingered over a turn of phrase. The characters were flawlessly drawn. I saw them. I heard their voices, felt their lives. I came to know these people as much as if I'd sat with them in Rose's warm little kitchen sipping tea and nibbling cream cakes buns while she fussed about.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a good book. I will read it again.
B003MC5AV2|5.0|OMG! I loves this book so much. I couldn't stop reading it. The ending was the best. Plus Nat was a jerk. But Penny was the best through out the hole book. I like the way that she can stand up for what she believes in. This book was amazing I loved every part of it.
0425263908|5.0|Awesome, sexy! After the 50 Shades of Grey Series, I found Sylvia Day's of much better quality.  Would like more of her books on the subject
B00CE03UOC|5.0|my daughter got me hooked on this game!  just the right amount of brain power needed but not so stressful.  love it!
B000FBJFSC|2.0|The Angela that the title references is the guy's dead mother.  The tone is rather dismal and disengaging.  I did not like the writing style.  I just think that when a person reflects on their mother, perhaps, there would be a more sentimental tone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game had no lag, had lots of exclusive stuff, and there was very neat places on the world tour.I really really really love the game.I always play this game about 24/7. I think you should buy this game
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story! What it was really like to fly in the European Theater and how men could maintain their humanity and civility.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton did not disappoint in this 3rd season.<br />Major moments and plot turns in almost every episode.<br />Next year will tough without Matthew and Syble....
B004TI1WME|5.0|I love this app for balancing my checkbook.  I can see if I have made an incorrect entry going back several entries and all the displays are super-easy to see.  The only thing I would change is to make the calculator keys a  little bigger.  I have pudgy fingers and I have to backspace and retype numbers because I pressed two at once.  I have the same problem texting, so it isn't a failing of the app, just an improvement that I would like.<br />I had looked online before for a calculator that acted like an office calculator so that when there was a calculation error it was easy to find.  I could find several scientific calculators, but this app was something I really needed that I couldn't find on the internet.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not stop reading....I was saving this trilogy to read on the beach this summer, alas I have completed the series in less than 5 days. I work full time & have a family which = late, late, late nights!!!!<br />Totally worth it!!! Thanks for such a great read!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This one tops the last album by far! I have been a fan for over 10 years now and this is some of his best work.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The game is great except the collected items are not named when you tap on them. Some are hard to recognize.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|just started using love it across devices. hard time understanding photo piece.  Enjoying using the task list and exploring the app
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|I ENJOYED DUETS II.  TONY'S SELECTIONS HAD A WIDE VARIETY OF PEOPLE.<br />IT COULDNT HAVE BEEN ANY BETTER. WATCHING IT FOR THE THIRD TIME.
B007IK44CK|3.0|This is a better film than the last MI but writing this review months later, for the life of me i can't remember what the film was about/. Kinda like mind candy. You watch it to be entertained, but once it's gone,it's gone. No sustenance.  As mind candy, it's OK. Watchable. Entertaining action fluff.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked the premise of this game.  It was a lot of fun, but it was too short.  I hope they have a full length game in development.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Good Storyline and Lego Humor.....the packaging of the Blu-Ray was Very, Very Poor.<br />I hope someone higher up in management looks at the way they ship Blu-Rays now and<br />realize it is horrible and fix it.
B008TTPQXA|2.0|Well, for beginners it was okay, but who is a bit trained in afterlife stories and near death experiences will find the book too simple and has a feeling &#34;was it just this???&#34;. Well, I am a medical doctor and accept the concept of NDE and it is really strange that this neurosurgen considers his NDE as the most remarkable experience in our world and noone before had such a deep NDE. He usually repeats himself through the book that he had such a rare condition and such a unique NDE and the true content is really short and shallow. Everything is about that he is the most perfect person describing NDE.<br />So I feel this book is a bit sensationism.
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|The movie was Very Good, but I am disappointed with the damage to the outside cover to the<br />Blu-Ray...I collect movies as some people collect Baseball Cards and want to keep from the<br />individual discs in Mint Condition and Every Component, including the Jacket Cover and the<br />Blu-Ray Jacket and the way Amazon has started shipping is declining....they used to ship items<br />very well with protection....now they use this crappy box that is not even sealed and it doesn't<br />protect the product very well.....with other retailers matching prices now, on buying a $25 or $40<br />product, I will pay the sales tax to get the product shipped to me as if I picked the box up from the<br />store and kept it protected to my home and the DVD Cabinet.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is one of the best T.V. shows ever!!  The DVDs were perfect.  Shipped on time and<br /><br />arrived in perfect shape.  I would buy them again or any other DVDs.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Always always save your pearls because there is no way to get some quickly without buying any.....and you need a ton of pearls to grow things
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The Power of Habit not only provides insight into the functioning of habits and the power they exert on our lives, but also presents a message of hope that anyone can train themselves to have free will. We can choose how we want to be. Inspirational.
B00846REIS|4.0|Loved this book! I would definitely recommend reading this book. Its a very fast read & draws the reader in immediately. Gideon is a very dominant, possessive, caring, amazingly loving & romantic with Eva who is hardworking, loving & head over heels for Gideon. Cary is Eva's bi-sexual best friend who always has interesting things happening to him. This is a must read
B007THA4FI|1.0|Having loved the Harry Potter books, I was curious to see what Ms. Rowling would do with a more adult book. My conclusion... stick to what you're good at. This book drug on and on. Not a single character was truly sympathetic, probably because every character was sketched so thinly, with no depth or variety. I like stories with flawed characters. But the inhabitants of Pagford and Yarvil were so two-dimensional with their flaws that even the attempt to redeem a few of them at the end seemed contrived.<br /><br />I hold some hope out for the kind of writing we know Ms. Rowling can produce, but this is definitely not it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Kill Bill 3: Django Edition.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe this movie, but it was entertaining and good. So, considering this is probably what Tarantino wanted, good on him.<br /><br />Acting is pretty good. Waltz is charming as usual, but he always strikes me as playing the exact same neurotic character in every movie.<br /><br />If you like Kill Bill, you'll probably like this. If you hated Kill Bill, you probably won't like this. It's very much the same exact concept.<br /><br />POTENTIAL SPOILERS -<br />Django follows the exact same flow as Kill Bill (reasons for revenge established, let's make a list of who we need to kill and do it) in the beginning, then adds on the 'finding Kerry Washington' story.<br /><br />It's good, not ground-breaking. I enjoyed it, but I still feel ambivalent. It was a good action (and yes, gorey) romp, but not awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Tarantino cameo was funny-ish.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|And a somewhat dull ending to an otherwise thrilling story line. It's a a if the author just had to end the story without really thinking through all the many possibilities that would have held up the level of bravery and intensity the rest of the trilogy delivered.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game. It has better graphics and a better plot than most hidden object games. Wouldn't mind seeing more in this style. Only gripe is that that it could have been longer, but that's pretty much across the board.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun. I wish it did not have a life limit. It is fast paced and challenging. It is a great game
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I like Tom Cruise. My sister has been reading the Jack Reacher  books so when the movie came out she went to see it. She really liked it so I bought it. It's a pretty good movie, action packed.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I found I would plan to watch an episode and stay watching till the disc till it was finished .I can recommend it is a great watch as some things are a real surprise
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a fun way to do puzzles.  It is a little hard to move the pcs. but you will figure it out after doing the first puzzle  There are quite a few pretty pictures to do.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Absolutely beautiful. Loved reading every single word. Loved the stories and how they interlaced with the different people, cities, continents..... So clever. But mostly, I loved the writing, the emotion, the beauty.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think  if you would like to play a game that challenges you play this one.  It is amazing . And you will love it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very clever puzzle game, not a bunch of mindless clicking. You really have to think to figure it out. Can't wait until the next one comes out!
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|Love Michael and the trip down memory lane.  Very nice choices for the duets also.  How can you NOT love Michael?!
0783225733|5.0|Excellent movie.  Glad to have it in our dvd collection.  Would recommend to anyone who needs a gift or likes classic movies.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Followed his journey through American Idol and knew from the beginning he would be an original and unique artist.  His first album is a must have!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app was much needed for my daily activities.  I was disappointed that I didn't h.  ave a w.ay to take notes for my tablet.  Thanks to evernote I have the electronic complete planner in the palm of my hands
B001F6TXME|5.0|Well, I suppose any good photographer knew, but I put off buying one of these.  What a difference it makes, especially when taking still photos with my Super Zoom Optika lens!  A must have for anyone using a zoom and a tripod!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What an amazing story! What starts out as a typical John Grisham work of fiction, powerfully escapes into a fantastically creative sideshow. While the book stalls in the middle to regroup, the steam it builds in the middle is mind boggling as you rush to steady yourself and ask a thousand questions which ultimately get answers in the end...simply PHENOMENAL !!!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I am so utterly disappointed and disgusted by the last Sookie Stackhouse book; it is a complete piece of literary garbage! Not only does it feel like a stab in the back from the author, it is full of errors, inconsistencies, poor plot development and execution, not to mention a complete assassination of past character development. Its like I was reading a completely different series! Charlaine Harris, for whatever F*ed up reason, hates her fans and decided to take a dump on them and her entire Southern Vampire Mysteries series with this fustercluck* of a book.<br />******SPOILERS******<br />Any and all growth that Sookie has made in the past 12 books is completely eliminated in this one, she is now a hypocritical backwater-hick townie, just like everyone else in Bon Temps and of course her maker Charlaine Harris. This book basically trashes and destroys the character that is Eric, justifies Bill the rapist, talks about Sookie's sweaty butt crack (I kid you not!), solves the entire \\"mystery\\" (if you can call it that) in just a couple of pages, makes Sookie realize a trailer behind a bar and \\"Sweaty Seal Sex\\" with Sam is exactly what she has always wanted, plus a whole truck load of more bull crap I don't care to write about.<br /><br />I completely loved the other books in the series, I have been a loyal fan and reader for many years now, but this just feels like a slap in the face! Don't take my word for it, just read and compare this book to any of the others and you will not only notice a different writing style, but different characters, a completely different take on sex scenes, and a whole other Sookie. The only two reasons this could have happened are either she hired someone to write the book for her and they completely missed the mark, or she just hates her fans and Sookie for that matter. This story makes no sense and Charlaine Harris should really be embarrassed of herself for having it published....end rant!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Preying on those of faith, changing nothing for those who do not believe.<br />Pure cash-grab... like all of those authors pandering porn and vampires after Twilight and 50-Shades

B007RQ6WCA|4.0|Excellent to convey what you need to if email doesn't cut it as far as size of files is concerned . Also perf<br />ect for sharing with specific persons any file you like . 2 gig free is a lot of space for free . Easy as pie to use and sync .
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Or is that 'A lot of BS here'?  Blake Shelton (BS) seems to be the new golden boy of country music. And this record shows that he isn't slowing down anytime soon. If you are a fan, you will love this record. If you are a first time listener, the record will probably convince you that you need to do a little research and find out what else you have been missing out on.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|It's a really fun game I wish it was free on my kindle I really like the cartoons I recommend this game.
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|Lady A does it again. Another great collection of music worth listening to. The band continues to grow and the sound of their music is reflected with a richness that can only come from maturity. Keep up the good work, guys.

B00BI745AA|5.0|I had not read the book so did not know what to expect. I was a little tentative about it being a musical and 2 1/2 hours at that.  I am so glad I saw this movie. It was a wonderful depiction of how powerful goodness in a human being can affect those around him.  A story of determination to do the right thing even at the risk of losing your own freedom or your own life.  We need more stories, more movies like this. A must see!
B0089EHWQE|2.0|Not sure if this story falls under romance. I got a feeling that Will was not in love with Lou. He did care but not loved. By the end of the book I was totally disappointed in Will. He had money, family, and a loving mate to at least try to make it work. But he did not. It was also very selfish of him to ask Lou to be present at the suicide. He could have got her closure with a  letter or a call before he  left to Switzerland. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a strong love story.
B004SKJTY6|3.0|slightly disappointed since I had hoped it was the full movie but was only the preview. Otherwise, it was what it was.
B0000714BP|5.0|I liked the story line, and every one of the actors that starred in this fun movie, but wouldn't missed seeing Wesley Snipes in drag for anything!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Who wants to go shopping?  Dawn of the Dead. The original. It's pretty simple really.  If Night of the Living Dead (1968) is A New Hope. Then Dawn of the Dead (1978) is the Empire Strikes Back of zombie flicks.  In other words, it's a classic sequel that trumps the first installment. This rarely happens in films. When it does it's important to take note. Judging by the current zombie trend in pop culture, the world did not miss this one. A strong argument could be made that Dawn of the Dead is the best and most dynamic zombie film ever made. It really has classic written all over it. It was directed by classic zombie aficionado George Romero in 1978. He was at the absolute top of his game and the zombie culture needed a figure head. Dawn of the Dead provided zombie legend with a philosophical foundation.  This film essentially planted the seeds for everything zombie oriented that would come later. Tom Savini, also in top form, was in charge of the gore and special effects. It all worked then, and it still works now. Arguably, more then ever.  The main reason for this film's longevity is rooted in the subtext. Zombie apocalypse survivors barricade themselves into a shopping mall. For the duration of the film, the survivors are stuck in a mall surrounded by zombies. Sound familiar? Some call it genius others call it disgusting.  For the bold philosophical statements this film makes alone, I'll put it at the top of any list, zombies or whatever. Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a statement about humanity.  What the hell are they? They are us. Thats all.

B006CUDDUG|5.0|The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is the novel that propelled John le Carre into bestseller-dom. After reading the book, it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Le Carre provides a tautly written thriller with excellent characterization. Alec Leamas, station chief for the UK Berlin intelligence office, appears in the novel awaiting the arrival of Karl Riemeck, an agent of Leamas's to arrive from East Berlin. Leamas has had a hard time recently. His agents have been picked off one-by-one, and Riemeck is his last. A car arrives carrying Riemeck's girlfriend, who knows the truth. Leamas realizes that Riemeck has been reckless, which is born out when Riemeck is shot dead before crossing the border.<br /><br />The rest of the novel is about Leamas and Circus's plan to exact vengeance on Hans-Dieter Mundt, the head of East German intelligence, who Leamas holds responsible for the death of his agents. The method to achieve this revenge is pretty straightforward: Leamas will act the part of a fired and disgraced intelligence officer descending into alcoholism, providing a target for turning against the UK. Leamas and Circus has set up a series of transactions to implicate Mundt and get the East Germans to take care of Mundt. As Leamas acts his part, he falls for a co-worker in a library, Liz Gold. In the end, Circus was actually protecting Mundt and bringing down Mundt's rivals in the East German service, for Mundt is the UK's man on the inside. Gold was brought over to help destroy Mundt's rival, but in hers and Leamas's attempted escape back to the West, both are killed. Leamas turned back for Gold and the circle of the novel is complete: Riemeck dies at the Berlin Wall for trusting his girlfriend. Leamas dies at the Wall for falling in love.<br /><br />Control throughout the novel remains mysterious, and his larger plan to protect Mundt is hidden from Leamas and the reader, revealing a cold-blooded calculation that Leamas admires even as he realizes his has been used. The novelis not filled with extraneous description, keeping close to Leamas's and Gold's points of view. As in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I admire the way le Carre writes Control, an enigma even to his direct subordinates. The Circus seems enigmatic as well, a mystery to itself and its employees, which is probably the nature of spy agencies. Leamas, in contrast, is clear: He wants revenge on Mundt and is willing to go very far to do so. Gold is his weakness. Fatality, as it turns out.<br /><br />Le Carre is a master. Read the book.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|A very nice selection of tunes and audio from the movie. I'm very glad that I ordered this sound track.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|like many folks i heard this was 'madonna directing' and dont expect much. so at a recent blockbuster closing they had the dvd for .99 and even then i thought, 'do i dare waste this dollar on a movie directed by madonna?' but i went ahead and glad i did. very moving tale of love with an excellent soundtrack (the same guy did 'a single guy' sdtk which is amazing) and the actors and music really pulled me in and i actually had tears in my eyes towards the end! so def if you re in the mood to watch a flashback of a love story with great acting n direction be pleasantly surprised like i was. i def will watch again :)

B003YL4LYI|5.0|Fifth of the Martin series, continues with intrigue and unexpected twists.  Can't wait for book six!  Hopefully sooner than later.
B0084YCKMU|5.0|I've always been a Sherlock Holmes fan ever since I saw the first movie of the cinema series in America. I saw it multiple times in theaters and was in absolute awe of the character that is Sherlock Holmes. And then of course I glanced through the books, but these were during my preteens years where I wasn't really into the world of good stories commonly associated with \\"nerds\\" or \\"geeks\\" aka smart people. However, right after Sherlock, before I really got into the books, I discovered more classic fandoms like Doctor Who (Huge Doctor Who Fan), Star Trek and instead of reading Sir Arthur Doyle's books, I was reading science books.<br /><br />So, I mostly forgot about the idea of Sherlock until suddenly I was noticing a this \\"Sherlock\\" thing popping up over the web in the realm of Doctor Who sites, images, tumblr, etc. I was intrigued... because it looked interesting, but I didn't really think it would be on the edge of most of my series.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. The writing is impeccable. The character chemistry is amazing. You fall in love with the series in seconds and the story flows so well with only 6 episodes! They write Sherlock in a unique way, and my personal perspective on the difference between the American version and this is the writing, simple as that. The American versions seem to put more effort in the cinematography, while these guys making gripping stories.<br /><br />If you like stories where intelligence equals cool, come along and check this out.
B006QS0KO6|5.0|Reading Robert Louis Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I was reminded of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Both novels involve the idea of tampering with science in a controversial way and expecting positive results. Much like Victor Frankenstein learns that you can't \\"play God,\\" Dr. Jekyll comes to realize the dark side of experimentation gone wrong. Neither character has the resolve to own up and take responsibility of their actions until things are well out of hand.<br /><br />As much as the novel illustrates how the results of science can turn awry, the story also questions duality within oneself. In the novel, the rational side (Jekyll) of a man is tempted into various forms of sin and sinister behavior (Hyde). One side soon becomes the more dominant of the two, and there is a struggle to escape from this dark side. When Jekyll becomes Hyde, he erupts into various forms of grotesqueness. Hyde is physically repulsive, but also repulsive in character. Hyde in many ways is an outlet for Jekyll to experience unrelenting freedom and \\"do as he pleases\\", despite the costs or consequences. It's ironic that this newfound \\"freedom\\" for Jekyll's other self actually turns into a form of a prison, where he has to physically isolate and hide himself from society to protect others.<br /><br />There are many morals this novel delves into and investigates. There are also many thinking points about human psychology and human nature. In many ways, this novel is groundbreaking and innovative, ahead of its time. It's easy to see why this novel has spawned countless film adaptations and productions, remaining quite popular and part of our pop culture.<br /><br />Not only that, but this novel is just a great book, well written and with so many different elements. It has exceptional moments of suspense, mystery, philosophy, science, and a darkly Gothic atmosphere to lure you in.<br /><br />Stevenson's novel is one to read, and then come back to and read again..
B00CW665VI|2.0|I found parts of this book very funny though not the bits the author probably intended to be funny. The story is told by the hero (well better described as a creep)and has been written by a woman who has obviously believed everything she has read in fictional romance novels about men in general. In the end the hero comes across as someone even men would shy clear of and the heroine, well she pretty much gets what she deserves.<br /><br />It was just so much work to suspend belief enough to even pretend that this guy could really exist somewhere on the planet. Still, the writing style was pretty cool and the story moved along fairly quickly but in the end I just felt pity for the girl for being taken in by this fool of a man. Some of the comedy is the sort of stuff you cringe at but still get a laugh out of as you read it. And please read this one just for the fun of the characters as there is no underlying plot twists or secrets worth worrying about. Alternatively, just rent the DVD for War of the Roses for much the same lines and characters.<br /><br />Recommended read if you don't want cliff hangers, deep plots, and drama, just laughs and a few healthy cringes.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|despite knowing the outcome, this was a great thriller, full of twists and intrigue.  more political sided yhan combat but a good dose of both.
B003K07DUC|2.0|If you want to gaze behind the Green Curtain (pun intended) and see how the warped mind of the Leftist operates, you can't go wrong by watching the Green Zone.  If you want an accurate picture of what happened in Iraq and the geopolitical framework in which the war occurred, look elsewhere.  Nothing to see here.  I was there as a Soldier in 2003, 2004 and 2008, occasionally working in the Green Zone itself.  This movie's cynical attempt to malign the American effort is sickening.  The only reason I give the film two stars instead of one is solely for the cinematography.  Substantively, it's a political hit piece.
B00CAJMGDI|1.0|Noodling on the violin on top of drum-machine track.<br /><br />Vaguely Scottish (and not particularly good, at least when compared to Alasdair Fraser and other fiddlers who really know what they're doing) fiddling over a boring, heavily base centric, drum-machine track and a lightweight synthesizer. It's not even good by new-age standards.<br /><br />Hard to imagine how this pablum got so many good reviews.

1596680296|5.0|I am a novice knitter - have only done rectangles up to this point - and wanted to learn sock knitting. I went on to the sock knitters forum at ravelry to get suggestions where to start. The members almost unanimously recommended this book, and \\"Silver's Sock Class\\", a free online tutorial. I started with the free lesson, and knit my first sock without any real issues. The sock class though is just for learning and doesn't have sizes or anything. After many months I finally bought this book. 2 weeks later I have my first pair of socks! The instructions are very clear, and it tells you how to size your pattern for any foot. Well worth the money, I wish I had bought it sooner!

B000P0J0A6|4.0|If only Billy had been more responsible and not let that kid in his room.  I tell you...  This is the movie that made America want a real live Mogwai.  Or at least me.

B00CMT54DA|5.0|Alright alright alright. MUD is about that moment in our lives when our crazy dreams about life come into contact with its even crazier realities. MUD is a mix of Mark Twain and Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald with a splash of GOONIES, WINTERS BONE and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD.  As he did in The Paperboy and Killer Joe, McConnaughey tones down the pretty boy image and completely disappears into this role.  It's a standout performance in a film that also features notable performance by Sam Shepard, Reese Witherspoon, Michael Shannon, and a whole host of newcomers.<br /><br />(In a role that had to have been written for him and him alone) Matthew McConnaughey plays a hard-living sociopathic castaway kept alive by a steady diet of romantic readiness and a rather less steady diet of Beanie Weenie.  Like all American dreamers (and MUD is really a distillation of them all), he is completely out of touch with the world as it actually is and a practiced master of the art of self-deception, and, as is the case with so many American dreamers, it's this eternally renewed self-deception that allows him to remain innocent despite his years of experience. Or at least from a distance he appears to be innocent, but when we get up close his gritty drifter skin and his empty stare seem to tell the part of his tales that he dare not speak aloud.  When two 14 year-old Arkansas boys, Ellis and Neckbone, find him living in a boat stranded in the treetop of an uninhabited isle, one, Neckbone, immediately assumes he's a bum but the other, Ellis (played by one of the best kid actors I've ever seen), senses something noble and even inspiring about his determination to dream big despite the fact that he has nothing in this world but a dirty shirt, a rusty Colt 45, and an old boat stuck up in a tree (that he's claimed as his own). It's through Mud that they get their initiation into life and it's through them that he gets his.<br /><br />This doesn't sound like your typical coming-of-age story and it isn't. For one, most kids never meet much less befriend a homeless man (and, possibly, a murderer) who lives (for the moment) on a swampy copperhead-infested isle.  But these aren't your normal kids, these are river kids, born and raised on riverboats and moored to a way of life that dates back a good two-hundred or more years. These are not suburban kids. They do not even have computers nor do you get the idea that they've ever seen one. They don't even have tvs. They're not interested in \\"that life.\\" They spend every spare second they have exploring the rivers many estuaries and venturing out  further and further toward ever bigger bodies of water. These kids are adventurers.  They are in search of life (and everything that word suggests).  They are aearching for the same thing their daddies searched for (but maybe didn't find or haven't yet found).  They mind their daddies (or uncles) and they respect them and talk like them and gather what wisdom they have just as their daddies did -- by listening and watching how other people live and absorbing whatever they can from whoever they can, but they are young and idealistic and they are not ready to settle down just yet. There is a wildness in them that they need to explore first, especially in Ellis. And Elllis sees that same wildness in Mud.  As unlikely as the friendship is between Ellis and Mud, it also makes sense: they are each at a crucial point in their own coming-of-age stories and each seems particularly suited to offer the other some much-needed and sought-for insight and perspective.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of this film is that it features two roughhewn American figures in Ellis and Mud and that they make such a perfect team. One is still genuinely innocent while the other has never really figured out how to make that transition from childlike innocence/idealism to adult experience. What really attracts Ellis to Mud is the way he talks about his lifelong love. The other adults in Ellis's life (mainly his parents) have been worn down by their relationships but Mud is enlivened by love.  And that appeals to Ellis and helps encourage his own bourgeoning romanticism. The difficult thing for both Ellis and Mud is figuring out how best to adjust and align their romantic notions/expectations with actual reality instead of making one the enemy of the other.  Mud has never been much good at learning from experience and adjusting his sites and expectations as he goes but, as romantic as he might be, Ellis is a quick learner and Ellis seems to be the one person Mud is willing to learn from. So MUD works as an interesting twist on The Great Gatsby: Mud can be viewed as the eternally romantic Gatsby kept afloat by dreams and Ellis can be viewed as the much more grounded Nick Carraway. It's not so much that Mud's version of Daisy, Juniper (played by a hot-blooded, booty-shorted Reese Witherspoon), is a bad girl or unworthy of his affection, it's just that she knows that no human being can be asked to accompany a dreamer to their own private dream lair and that's the only reality that Mud has ever known.  He loves her, but she always runs away. She loves him, but he lives in his own private world. They've played this dangerous game of attraction/repulsion their entire lives without understanding it. And Ellis (like Nick Carraway in The Great Gatsby) becomes the messenger who must read each character and translate each to the other. And Ellis proves magnificently capable at this task.<br /><br />So after some near-lethal run-ins with a den of copperheads, a girl named May Pearl, and a band of pissed-off redneck assassins (seems the guy Mud killed awhile back has a lot of angry friends) everyone comes of age in a satisfying way.  Great film.  McConnaughey is on a streak. Also fun to see Sam Shepard in this story since this is exactly the kind of tale (doomed lovers ensnared by one another) he has been telling his entire life. Witherspoon is perfect as well. But the real break out star is the child actor, Tye Sheridan (Ellis). A must-see.he other adults in Ellis's life (mainly his parents) have been worn down by their relationships but Mud is enlivened by love.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My family was afraid that Pixar working with Disney would spoil the film, but in fact it is endearing, charming and magical. Our favorite character was the mother who turns into a bear. She was hilarious and sweet at the same time. Really a good movie for all ages.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|Nice picture. It was a good picture and I enjoyed watching it. I pre-ordered it so I got a really good price on it
B009AMANBA|5.0|In my opinion, Lincoln should have won the Oscar instead of Argo. It was a brilliant representation of a turning point in American history that everyone should see. Daniel Day-Lewis channeled Lincoln in a mesmerizing way. If you love historical drama or were a West Wing fan, you will love this. If you are all about car chases, blood, violence, and shot-em-ups, this may not the movie for you.
B00846REIS|3.0|It started off great. At first I was happy to have found a book to follow up fifty shades. The sex scenes were great but the back story became very annoying. People who could identify with the characters would probably enjoy this book more than me.  The surrounded out nicely though and my disappointment decreased. Overall, I would still recommend it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought one of these toys from the Amazon top 100 list, because my son wasn't real specific on what he wanted for his birthday. When he opened the package up, this toy immediately became the center of attention. His sister, and myself, all struggled to get a turn playing with this thing. You wouldn't imagine at first that a clear sphere with a small metal marble inside would generate this much curiosity, but this one succeeds. It was definitely a winner in my house!
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|Keeps your mind constantly questioning who you believe is the good person. The acting is awesome and also not typical to what the actors normally portray
B001EC2J20|5.0|Movie reviewers like to dissect movies based on acting ability, and a host of other things that regular people might never think about, when going to see a movie. Sometimes, those reviews are useful. Sometimes, not so much.<br /><br />Personally, I would like to see 3 more Matrix movies. I like them that much. I'm not the kind of person who usually watches movies repeatedly, unless I really, really like them. This series of movies is one I like that much.<br /><br />I'm a skeptic, but I suspend my disbelief, so I can believe in the Matrix. Now, please, make a few more!
B00BIRRDZ4|3.0|I agree completely with Papa Joe's assessment of this yawn inducing CD.<br />Yes there are comparisons to be made with Jackson Brown, America etc. but<br />the cliches just pile one on-top of the other for those of us who lived through<br />the genre (Adult Contemporary Rock). I can't really muster up<br />the energy to actually hate this, I just will not play it as I have a few<br />hundred albums in this vein that are more inspirational.<br />  Here are a few suggested albums/artists that fans of Dawes might like that<br />have a bit more edge and creativity: Jonathan Wilson's Debut CD-Gentle Spirit<br />(I think he produced this Dawes album). Ethan Johns latest--If Not Now...,<br />Damien Jurado's Saint Bartlett and Maraqopa CDs, Laura Veirs--Saltbreaker<br />and July Flame CDs, Angus Stone's-- Broken Brights, Father John Misty's Fear<br />Fun and both Tift Merritt's Traveling Alone and Beth Orton's latest are career<br />highs for them. The Brits--Laura Marling, Richard Thompson, Robyn Hitchcock and newcomer Jake Bugg have all put out great Folk/Rock CDs recently and the Eels<br />(an American songwriter) has put out a great wonderful, glorious CD. But, I<br />guess if you are on xanax this Dawes CD may just be your cup of relaxing brew,<br />not too taxing on the overworked psyche.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I do not recommend this movie.  Not very good.  Slow.  Ineffective dialog.  Waste of time.  You will probably be happier to view a different movie.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Sherlock has always been my favorite TV series and will always be. The actors are perfect for the roles and I am so eager for the 3rd season. I love how this takes place in modern time and each story has it's own twist (not completely based on original stories).

B008133DO8|5.0|I don't have anything bad to say about this TV series. Both seasons were amazing and the last episode left me hanging. I'll be happy if the third season is half as good as the second.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Truly funny, musical adventure of all four Beatles, whose goal is to save Ringo from the religious cult who want to kill him, due to the sacrificial ring being stuck on his finger.  Just as good as I remember it!
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Worst movie i have seen in a long time, it jumps back and forth through time lines like 52 card pick up. Hard to follow, and gruesome. Maybe there is someone out there that likes it but this movie is for the birds. If you watch the last 15-30min you will under stand the movie instead of watching all the soap opera stuff at the beginning and middle of the movie.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|\\"Jack Reacher\\" was adapted from the 2005 novel \\"One Shot\\" by Lee Child, which is part of a series. Christopher McQuarrie both wrote and directed the film. A sniper goes on a killing spree in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing 5 unrelated people in broad daylight. Clues at the scene lead police detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) to arrest former army sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora), and District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) charges him with the crime. Barr refuses to speak to investigators but makes a single, written statement: \\"Get Jack Reacher\\". Reacher was a much-decorated MP investigator who knew Barr in the army. Barr's defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) assumes, incorrectly, that Reacher will be a character witness. In fact, Reacher dislikes Barr but is not satisfied with the evidence against him.<br /><br />I haven't read Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" books, so I don't know why this one, which is in the middle of the series, was chosen for the film or how much it may have been altered. But all of the characters in this movie are cartoons, the dialogue is conspicuously terrible to the point that it made me cringe, the plot is ridiculous at every turn, and we never understand any of the villains' motives. If that weren't bad enough, the female lead, defense attorney Helen Rodin, is dreadfully miscast. She is supposed to be a trial lawyer. Trial lawyers have strong personalities, and they do not show cleavage in the office. Helen doesn't even have a personality. Rosamund Pike's breathy voice sounds like a low-rent night club chanteuse who constantly flirts with customers. This is ridiculous on a lawyer. And the film runs too long at 2 hours, 10 minutes.<br /><br />But \\"Jack Reacher\\" shows us what a movie star is. Tom Cruise doesn't have the physical stature of Lee Child's Jack Reacher, but he sure has the screen presence. The man is 50 years old, and he is totally convincing as a smart, fist-pounding, gun-toting vigilante action hero. He's a movie star. He makes the audience want to watch him, even if we must endure the next ridiculous scene and torrent of corny dialogue to do it. I'm impressed. Tom Cruise's charisma can sometimes carry this movie. But Cruise is the only thing in \\"Jack Reacher\\" that is watchable. The only good thing I can say about McQuarrie's direction is that the omission of dialogue for the first 8 minutes works well. The film was a box office success, so the writers may get another crack at this character if it is to be a franchise. They have a great male lead. The rest of the package will need a lot of work.star. He makes the audience want to watch him, even if we must endure the next ridiculous scene and torrent of corny dialogue to do it. I'm impressed.

B009AMANBA|3.0|With all the talk of how great this movie is, I was somewhat disappointed when I finally sat down to watch it. I did enjoy it but it is not one of those movies that I would watch again and again, such as the God Father, Rocky, Pretty Woman, Gone with the Wind, etc.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book does a good job of bringing the three-volume narrative to a close, winding up the plot and tucking in the loose ends.  I enjoyed watching both main characters grow and change, though it all happens in a short period of time (I wasn't aware of this while I was reading the series).  Yes, I liked the sex!  My credulity was strained when Anastasia goes from intern to acting editor to editor in about a month, but it didn't harm the plot.  I like the &#34;extra&#34; scenes that follow the epilogue, especially the ones that show Christian's thinking when he meets Anastasia.<br /><br />This is not fiction for the ages.  It's a good vacation/beach read.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Okey, i got my sharpener today, opened box and ta-dam, serrated sharpener rod is broken. It looks like a useless item for me, because all my knifes have a little serrated part. I have to find another item, or request a full refund/replace. Good bye

0765325950|2.0|Disappointing.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of this series, and have only been half-heartedly<br /><br />following along to see the ending, and now that I've read it, I feel as if<br /><br />I had done a cafeteria's worth of dirty dishes: It wasn't terrible, but<br /><br />tedious and I'm just glad it's done!<br /><br />I commend Sanderson for his bravery in attempting to pull together this multi-tome series together with the notes left by Jordan, and he did an admirable job, considering.  Unfortunately, he's only a mediocre writer, and his prose seems...flaccid.  As a result, the great war of epic proportion between the Light and Dark was rather underwhelming.  Ashes, but shouldn't duels to the death have more oomph than stale oatmeal?<br /><br />For a massive, worldwide onslaught of evil, the casualty list was oddly low, with miraculous and undeserved survivals.  With all the armies of the world engaged in pitched battles, and wagonloads of channellers of both sides weaving their hearts out, the collateral damage was almost neglible.  There had been more fear, shock, and sense of loss during first Trolloc invasion of the Two Rivers!  And the Last Battle really boiled down to Rand and the Dark One having A PHILOSOPHICAL SHOUTING MATCH IN CAPSLOCK, interspersed throughout the book. Really.<br /><br />And then there are discrepancies and plot holes large enough to march a Trolloc army through, but I will give him SOME benefit of the doubt because it's not \\"his\\" world and he doesn't know the characters well.  Which might also be why so many of them were sent to sit in the corner for no apparent reason, or were made to hold the idiot stick for the same.<br /><br />The rapidfire change of POV added nothing to the tension or pace; it nearly gave me a literary form of motion sickness. And his overuse of character names is aggravating in the extreme: long passages consisting of \\"Mat is standing next to Perrin.  Mat said something to Perrin. Perrin nodded,\\" without nary apronounce in sight. I suppose if you were to trot out all two thousand characters at<br />once you would have to do that just to keep them straight, but Light, it reads like a third grader's book report!<br /><br />And the ending was an outrage!  In monumental bad taste of the Stephanie Myers level!  As if this was not egregious enough in itself, it came rudely abrupt after oh so much page fillers.  A more thorough epilogue might have helped smooth it out some, but not fix the inherent problem.<br /><br />And so, it was not a good ending, but at least it was \\"an\\" ending, thank the Light!  Most WoT fans will likely find it satisfactory, but I certainly would not turn newbies on to this series.<br /><br />***************************************<br /><br />This next part is the review I wrote immediately upon finishing the book, and it's a bit more...raw. Full of spoilers so read on at your own risk!<br /><br />*************************************<br /><br />Where in the Light were the Green Ajah?? You know, the one Ajah whose sole<br /><br />mission is to fight in the Last Battle? Did someone forget to send them an<br /><br />invite??? I guess it's just a fancy club for Aes Sedai who like having<br /><br />multiple Warders... (yes, I Disney-fied that)<br /><br />Why was Mat Cauthon, the living encyclopedia of all the world's military<br /><br />knowledge, sitting around twiddling his thumbs and being glared at by his<br /><br />wife? Oh that's right, he had to wait for the other plot hole to kick in so<br /><br />he can take over...which leads to my next point:<br /><br />Failing to shield their commanders against Compulsion? It's about as<br /><br />plausible as the forces of Light belatedly realizing, \\"Gee, so that's why we're sucking in this war: We forgot to bring armor and weaponry!  Please excuse our oversight.\\" What??<br /><br />Too many people met disappointing ends, or were just disappointing.<br /><br />Morraine, who broke hearts when she fearlessly dove though a gateway and<br /><br />took a Forsaken with her, finally returns to the sound of no fanfare,<br /><br />non-reunion with the Warder whose severance made him nearly insane, and<br /><br />sits in a cave for most of the book. Lanfear, who I always thought was the most dangerous and wily female Forsaken, got too abrupt an end with no encore. Moghedien got collared by the Seanchan after the war, a fate that made me shout with glee when it happened to first happened to Elaida, but after repeated use, it seems like a garbage-disposal fate in which to scrape female channellers no longer useful for the plot.<br /><br />Three separate people confront Demandred and duel to the death, one at a<br /><br />time... Is this Tarmon Gai'don or Nintendo classic?<br /><br />More over, Gawyn sneaking off to attempt to defeat the Forsaken in single<br /><br />combat was neither the action of a green soldier looking to make a name for<br /><br />himself in his first battle, nor of a seasoned commander of his own army.<br /><br />He was not much slain by Demandred as he was clubbed to death by the idiot<br /><br />stick... The only reason I could grope for his senseless death is that it<br /><br />could have been the trigger for Egwene's grand finale.<br /><br />Speaking of which, not five minutes after her rousing speech about how an<br /><br />Aes Sedai must pick herself up in the face of grief and join the Last<br /><br />Battle, Egwene, one of the most (one could say few) level-headed women in<br /><br />the entire series rushes out in a suicide run. Granted, it was in grand<br /><br />style, complete with special effects, and she did take out a Forsaken and<br /><br />yada-yada, but it still smacked of teenage girl moping over a sparkly<br /><br />vampire. But at least she managed to die...<br /><br />Which brings me to Mat Cauthon, who pulled the \\"taking you with me\\" trick<br /><br />with a major bad guy and whoops, he forgot he's immune. Oh well... I<br /><br />/facepalm myself so hard I actually had a Red Hand ... ha ha..  And Lan, my<br /><br />favorite character; while I'm glad he survived, I felt it cheapened his<br /><br />sacrifice. His last scene was bad-ass and un-sappy as the man himself, and<br /><br />it was a rather fitting tribute, if somewhat lackluster. But then the next chapter found him<br /><br />loafing about wearing a silver crown and a bandaid. /facebook this time...<br /><br />And if I was irritated at the non-sacrifices, when I got to Rand's, I<br /><br />seriously dropped the F-bomb, as in WTF??? After 14 tomes of doomy<br /><br />prophecies of doom, he gets up and walks away, with a handsome new body to boot! After resealing the Dark One<br /><br />in his prison thus winning the great war against evil, he strolls off,<br /><br />nearly whistling and wondering which of his nitwit harem will be following<br /><br />him, lighthearted as a sheepherder going to the village fair...Really?? Not<br /><br />only is it lame to the point of me expecting Bella Swan to pop out and wax<br /><br />lyrical about how beautiful he is, it's actually offensive that<br /><br />Rand-as-Savior (even this non-Christian noticed the similiarities of the<br /><br />wounds and the sacrifice), upon his \\"resurrection\\" immediately wonders<br /><br />which girl he will get to dandle on his knee. /flipdesk, /throwbook,<br /><br />/pick-up-book-because-it's-a-loaner, and<br /><br />/immensely-grateful-I-didn't-pay-for-this-crap!

B0093OGBL6|4.0|Most fans of Michael Jackson will find this to be an eye-opening, heartfelt account of his life during the last five years he was with us.  Dr. Moriarty is undoubtedly a very devoted fan and some may find her lavish praise and loving adoration a bit over-the-top.  Overall, she has taken considerable time and effort to write this expansive volume to set the record straight and further enlighten people to the extraordinary life he lived.  I found the chapters dealing with his finances most informative and I loved the way she painstakingly detailed how carefully and lovingly he cared for his children.  The reader should come away knowing, without question, that he was an exemplary, loving father.  Those who stubbornly cling to the notion that he molested children will learn that he was incapable of ever harming a child.  He lived for children.  His number one concern was raising awareness in our world that if we expect things to become better, we have to begin with our children--loving them more, giving them more of our time and protecting them from harm.<br /><br />Any book that focuses on the truth about Michael Jackson is a worthy read and this one fits the bill.  There are omissions and inaccuracies (first edition), but I recommend it, especially to those who are curious and want to see Michael Jackson in a different light, not just what the ugly tabloids and an unkind press wanted to project.<br /><br />We all grieve the loss of this astonishingly talented and caring man.  But my heart grieves most for Michael Jackson's children.  They lost a father the likes of which every child should have in their lives.<br /><br />The world is not the same without him.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|The Twilight Saga. Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The Vampire Diaries. These are just some of the well-known titles that populate the modern lore of the vampire. But it all started with a single novel written by Bram Stoker in 1897. The story of Dracula begins when the lawyer Jonathan Harker (one of the narrators) goes to Transylvania to finalize Count Dracula's purchase of a London house. It isn't long before Harker discovers that Dracula is a blood-sucker who is preying on the people of Transylvania. Dracula travels to England and preys on several innocent people, one of them a young lady named Lucy Westernra.  As Lucy makes the slow and agonizing transformation into a vampire, two esteemed doctors, John Seward and Abraham Van Helsing, wage war to save her life.<br /> Dracula was a good story. It had suspense, horror, and even a little romance. But like many stories, it had its drawbacks. At times, the language was rather melodramatic, and placed too much emphasis on the virtue and goodness of novel's two women, Lucy and her friend Mina Harker. Van Helsing and the other men idolize the goodness of these women to point where it literally becomes annoying. In addition, Van Helsing's English is so broken that sometimes it's difficult to understand him.<br /> Aside from those deficiencies, however, Stoker tells a good story. I found myself anxious with suspense as Van Helsing and Seward desperately infused Lucy with copious amounts of blood in a valiant attempt to save her life. I could literally feel Lucy's death coming inevitably closer. Lucy's eventual transformation into a vampire and her preying on the young children of England was truly sad and Stoker's description it was sensitive and poignant as well as Lucy's final when Van Helsing drove a wooden stake through her heart to end her reign of terror. Overall, this was a very good novel.
0345803485|1.0|I am not the sort of person who chases down the &#34;Best Sellers&#34; from the NY Times or even any other publication. So, I did not immediately notice this book even as it had climbed to its top spot on the list. &#34;Everybody's reading it&#34; isn't what prompts me to read anything, and sometimes even makes me suspicious in a jaded, &#34;What is this world coming to?&#34; sort of way.<br /><br />But I kept seeing references to this novel, and I really had no idea what it was about. When I learned it was erotica, my first reaction was, &#34;I don't read those books.&#34; The fact that &#34;everyone&#34; was reading it, however, intrigued me, which is what prompted me to order the thing. I figured that, if so many people are buying it, it must be well-written - perhaps even classy - erotica, if there is such a thing.<br /><br />Alas, that is not the case. This book is one of those rare novels which I won't even finish, and I don't like being a quitter when it comes to a book! I'm certainly no prude. My problem, in general, is not with the topic, but rather the fact that there is nothing titillating about the writing at all. It's just attempting to hit you in the face with naughtiness and shock value. (Frankly, I felt neither naughty nor shocked while reading it, so that falls flat, as well.) There's no nuance. I had almost no interest in any of the characters, with the minor exception that I was wondering (a little) what was driving the main character. (I won't say what towards, as I don't want to spoil things for you.) This book reads like an immature male fantasy but is written by a woman. Without any real substance to the sex, I found the whole thing to be, well, impotent.<br /><br />So, there it sits, tucked away in the drawer with my unmentionables. I'm trying to decide whether to give it to the used bookstore or sell it back to Amazon. I'll do whatever takes the least amount of effort, because I've already wasted too many resources clicking a couple of buttons to order it online and having it shipped for free to my house.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a great read for anyone who enjoys running or trying to get into running.  And having it on my kindle was a plus.
B000067QMD|5.0|These are very useful to turn any Avent bottle into a storage container.  Just remove the nipple and pop this in its place to store in the fridge or freezer.  To use pop it out and put the nipple back in.  Very small, easy to use, and effective.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works, and that's pretty much it. It really helps that it is such a long cable, as 'other' cords for other products are  notorious for being short.<br /><br />I can see this lasting me a while.
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|I read this book due to all the five star reviews.  I found it to be a very dark, depressing novel.  It was the first Bukowski novel I'd read.  I'm certain I'll never read anything else like it.  It is definitely unique but I don't care to read about a mean alcoholic who enjoys beating up people, friends included.  Obviously many people did enjoy the book - to each his own.  I googled images of Mr. Bukowski.  Had I done this prior to reading the book, I would not have read it.  The images of him with women said it all.  Nothing I needed to see or read.  Yes, it is understandable, with his miserable youth, that he had a chip on his shoulder, and that was sad.  Guess it just wasn't something I could enjoy reading about.
B009LXEBD4|2.0|I remember hearing on the news, Clarkson was fighting with Clive Davis over one of their albums or something.  If this is the one, Kelly was right.
B0064MGU98|3.0|If you like lawyer stories and government intrigue.  You might like this.  She's very cute!  The adolescents are properly obstructive.
B0013FNC38|3.0|The album has only a few songs I really like.  I was disappointed and have been tempted to send it back.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|It's hard to understand why this didn't do better at the cinema - it's actually an above average thriller - pulp fiction beginnings, but pieced together into a screenplay that fairly sizzles along, and runs like clockwork.  Tom Cruise might not look quite the bruiser that the books apparently have him written, but coming to the movie without preconceptions, I certainly bought in to him as the outsider with a drive for his own personal brand of justice, which doesn't always mean living on the right side of the law.  He brings a pent up but honed, trained energy to the part which works well.<br />It would be fair to say that the plot doesn't rely on action set pieces, but when they do come along they are well executed, notably the mid movie car chase, rather that the slightly more pedestrian conclusion. Satisfyingly, these set pieces serve the plot rather than appearing to be merely a studio request.  Most satisfyingly still, although the storyline wanders some well trodden paths (Jack Bauer meets John Rambo..?), it does so in some unexpected ways.. not that it is a twisty plot per se, just that it is not sign posted from the outset, and the screenplay sparkles with some memorably economic dialogue.  If the secondary characters are given lesser roles to play with, it's almost forgivable in the face of the efficiency of the plot as it careers along, as driven as the main character.<br />Christopher McQuarrie should be congratulated on getting an excellent balance of intelligence and thrills, and a good performance out of Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise doing his own stunts - notably in the driving - certainly adds to a sense of realism which helps the movie, as does a memorable cameo from Robert Duvall.<br />I'm not encumbered by any preconceived notions of the character or the story, not having read any of the books.  However on the basis of this film, I'd be delighted to see more of the same.. and Tom Cruise did convince me at least as the unstoppable Jack Reacher.This isn't a movie which aims for the moon.. it's not trying to be the years most action packed, or most intense... however it has aimed to be a well crafted thriller bringing Lee Childs protagonist to the big screen in an intelligent and involving way.  And this it has done admirably.<br />8/10
B000008HZB|4.0|I had it on my Amazon wish list and was finally able to order it.  If you were ever an ELO fan and like Jeff Lynne,  you will like this.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This is okay.  My daughter said it was fun, however it is not going to be a favorite.  It is a little young for me.  Seems to be great for much younger people/children.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|From the first minutes to the end, a beautiful story. I was moved to tears and felt feelings I had forgotten.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun, entertaining and  quickly helps  time. It is easy to play. I recommend this game to anyone who likes solitaire.

B005CRQ3NY|4.0|It was so funny and I liked the pictures I read the book in two days I loved it so much
B003CI90MQ|4.0|Very informative - highly recommend for anyone with a digital srl camera - I can't wait To read the other books.
0823004325|5.0|My son-in-law, who is a graphics designer, specifically asked for this book, so I know he was happy with it.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I read this series of five books by George R. R. Martin because I had watched the HBO series &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; but found myself immersed, for the first time, in a fantasy world peopled by interesting and well-developed characters, with a spellbinding plot. The television series has been much more understandable as a result. But now that I care about these characters and this plot, I suppose I will order the next book in the series. Thanks, Mr. Martin, for an amazing joyride.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|My granddaughter asked for this CD as a birthday gift, and she was VERY happy to receive it.  I've made brownie points with her on this one.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Tremenda colección. Realmente las versiones de las películas son mejores que las originales, muchas escenas no vistas. Realmente para verlas varias veces.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it. Not much to say. Good solitaire app. Does what it says and works great on the kindle fire. No crashing. The adds pop up after each new game but it's free so that's fine.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife<br />Eben Alexander<br /><br />How do you rate this product? Was very good
B00BWDJILG|1.0|I have been a fan of Joshua since I first heard of him in 1991 when a local DJ gave me his original EP. I have all of his recordings and went to great lengths to see him in concert. As soon as I saw he had a new CD out I immediately bought it.<br />But this reminds me of the awful 1950 Verve recordings of Charlie Parker with strings. I will probably never listen to this again and am very disappointed. I hope this is a one time only mistake on Joshua's part. I don't see how this will win him any new fans.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Basically, after seeing this movie, I just want to throw money at J.J. Abrams and watch the happy come out.<br />As every other review says, he does a great job of maintaining the feeling of the original star trek, yet with fun, exciting, and honestly, better told versions of the stories all us Trekkies have grown to love.<br /><br />I cannot wait to see what he does with star wars.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|its a horrible app I downloaded a song I looked for it everywhere and I couldn't find it.this is the worst app ever!I wouldn't reccommend this app.just fyi the best music app I downloaded was called soundclound really good app.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game!  Have fun playing with my daughters!<br />We play it in the car and try to beat each other by how many times it takes to get each level.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|I placed my order for this item, and was told my CD would come in May 20th. I actually got it a week earlier. The CD was in good condition, and came with the original case and booklet. Good Stuff!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I've been watching the up and down reviews on this box set since it was released in November knowing all along that at some point I would take the plunge. The negative reviews posted regarding the quality of the vinyl made me very nervous. However, it seemed that as more time passed fewer negative reviews were posted. Not sure what that means... Quality issues were resolved?? The folks who sent two or three sets back due to problems finally just gave up?? Really do not know. But I finally got tired of waiting and bought the set in April. Along with it, I replaced my old turntable with an Audio Technica AT-LP120. The set arrived well packed well and suffered not the least bit of damage during shipping. The turntable and box set showed up on the same day and I was playing vinyl for the first time in 15+ years later that night.<br /><br />I will start by saying I do not consider myself an audiophile. I like listening to music using good equipment and can barely tell the difference between digital and analog but that's where my technical expertise ends. I fully admit to investing in this set as much for the idea of playing music the \\"old fashioned\\" way as for any perceived sound quality differences.<br /><br />I just finished listening to the last album start to finish... my least favorite Beatles album- Beatles For Sale. The entire set sounded great. Abbey Road sounded a little heavy on the bass, but I simply adjusted my receiver settings and all was good.<br /><br />So to anyone unafraid of blowing a few hundred bucks on some great music... I would heartily suggest - Go for it!!
0307895475|5.0|This is one of the best strategy guide that I have ever seen. There is a lot of content for the price, and that content is highly detailed and beautifully made. The only problems that I have with this product is that it was improperly packaged and it arrived with the corners bent on the first few pages; the map of skyrim that is included was difficult to tear out without tearing the map itself; also, it should be noted that this version of the guide does not include the Dragonborn add on, only Dawngaurd and Hearthfire, so it might be worth waiting to see if they come out with another revised copy which includes Dragonborn. Other than that, this strategy guide is absolutely perfect. There is an overwhelming amount of content, and it is organized in a clear and simple format. Skyrim is one of the few games that are worth buying a strategy guide for because of its immense, complex, and sophisticated gameplay. This guide will definitely help you on just about any subject in the game. 5 STARS!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I got the app when it was the last day it was $0.99 and I'm so glad because I would have had to pay $6.99!

B009K916ZK|5.0|Works fine and shipping was fast. The only problem I've had is that my MBP 15'' doesn't match the resolution of my monitor. I think it's an aspect ratio issue. It doesn't fully form to the 27'' monitor I'm using and I get black bars. Oh well.

B008VBYN80|4.0|cool but I want the kindle appstore to have clash of clans maybe it will soon I really really hope.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm puzzled by all the hateful comments. Just because you might not like the direction a character has taken, is no reason to belittle the creativity that the author displayed.<br /><br />Some have said there were no vampires in the book, and the series was about vampires.<br /><br />Well, I sure noticed the vampires (Bill, Eric, Pam, Karin) making appearances, and I always thought the series was about Sookie.<br /><br />Thank you, Mrs. Harris, for a delightful end to the series. You kept the series true to what \\"Sookie\\" wanted - as evidenced by her choice for her future.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and feel it deserves \\"5\\" star reviews!

B00BBQXQFI|4.0|Not sure I would call this a kid's movie as it is a bit dark, but it is a good versus evil and that works.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is a great game  but the only problem with it is that lags a lot. (Still a great game!!!)
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I'm not sure what people were talking about on the other reviews.  It seems like they were all written by the same person.  I played this game for about 5 minutes and was bored after the first minute.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I don't think I understood what I was getting when I downloaded this book.  I thought I was going to get a more detailed biography of Nikola Tesla who is widely regarded as a genius.  He is now recognized as the actual Father of Radio; he first visualized alternating current; he invented the underlying technology for fluorescent lighting & wireless communication, as well as concepts for wireless power transmission (blocked by owners of power companies; J.P. Morgan asked \\"If they can pull power out of the air, just anywhere, where are we going to put the meters?\\") and even some prototype electric power source for cars that he never completed, and the papers for which disappeared at his death.<br /><br />His journey was always driven by his striving to continue to develop ideas;  this writer shortens the biography summarily to encourage each of us to use our own imagination, as it appears to him that that is one of the cornerstones of a successful and fulfilling life, following one's dreams.  Oh darn.<br /><br />This book drew me the way a full hot tub full of bubbly bath water can draw me, especially after an active day -- it looked relaxing and its first chapter seemed to promise I would have a good long immersion in a fascinating subject.<br /><br />Instead, I felt like I had climbed into 3 inches of water.  All seemed as advertised -- the water was hot and bubbly, so to speak, the book started off in a very satisfying way. It was simply truncated so the author could, before his subject was fully perused, proclaim his conclusions on the importance of Imagination, and to encourage us to each find our own spark  .... what a disappointment.  From a readable writer, too, whose grammar and structure are smooth and companionable, and with such a fascinating person for his subject.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as an appetizer for a Tesla biography to be found elsewhere.  On the subject of the author's opinions on imagination, all I can say is, they did not inspire mine, and I was quite sorry.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|Did not expect much and exactly what I got. Oh, have to admit was good to see Arnold again and also glad to see his involvement was limited but plot, bad guys, so over done and then there as the injection of humor.... In the end, so glad I did not spend theater money on this one. Date movie?? Not really. Movie for viewing with spouse? Maybe but plenty of blood splatter and occasional foul language.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Lots of different configurations including traditional.  I would like an undo last move button but that's definitely not a deal breaker for me.  I don't care about scores or times (which this game has) so I just don't enter any name or initials at the end of each game.  For me, I just like playing the game and for that, this was the perfect choice.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I highly recommend this set because of its quality, the bits (which some are hard to find) and its flexible extender. The main reason I bought it was for its flexible extender and it has paid off multiple times. Must have for geeks like me.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun easy for young kids, entertaining for whole family. We have experienced trouble with it freezing up our kindled very displeased with that.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|having all movies to watch in order, to see growth in age & knowledge &magical mastery makes the collection a \\"must have\\" for Harry Potter fans!!  Love it!!
B003UYUP58|5.0|Very well researched, organized and written book detailing our on-going interaction with this very potent and &#34;resourceful&#34; natural enemy of human health and life.
0316066524|1.0|I purchased this based on the glowing reviews about how amusing this novel is.  Ugh.  Tom Wolfe, Chris Buckley, Mark Twain can each make biting social commentary, weave an interesting tale with interesting characters, and be hilarious.  This?  Makes a nice paperweight while keeping the paper industry happy due to its extraordinary length...which as an Upper Peninsula resident I do find important.  Otherwise this book is not an enjoyable read.  I wish I could get my money back!
B005LAIII0|3.0|I finally got around to watching Life of Pi. I was less than impressed.<br /><br />Sure, it was full of great visuals. Amazing visuals, even, but those don't make the story. [It's the same reason I could never follow a crappy story in a comic book just because it had good art (Spawn).] The story in Pi was very much lacking. The only reason it gets such a &#34;wow, that was so deep&#34; response is that it's one of those stories (the movie for sure and probably the book (though I haven't read the book)) that people can't figure out. Rather than say &#34;I don't understand,&#34; they instead say, &#34;that's so deep.&#34; Especially the critics, who can never just admit that something doesn't make any sense. Vague symbolism is always a sure way to baffle the critics into saying something is great. [One of my college professors was the same way. The sure way to getting an &#34;A&#34; from him on a paper was to write something beyond his understanding or deliberately vague enough that it seemed beyond his understanding. Rather than say &#34;I don't know what you're saying here&#34; or &#34;This doesn't make any sense,&#34; he'd just put an &#34;A&#34; on it.]<br /><br />However, the biggest problem with that aspect of the movie is that there is a message in there, revealed twice during the movie but obfuscated rather than just stated plainly: believing a lie is better than believing nothing. Or, as it's put forth at the end, &#34;It's better to believe a beautiful lie rather than an ugly truth.&#34; That's a sorry message to be delivering and one I just can't get behind. No matter how pretty the package it's wrapped in, and Pi is a pretty package with beautiful bows and ribbons. It's not enough to disguise the ugly truth of the movie, though. Well, maybe, actually, it is. For most people.<br /><br />The other big issue I have with the movie is that I hate (I mean I absolutely can not stand) getting to the end of a story just to find out that it didn't happen. [I mentioned this same thing in my review of Looper.] Don't waste my time with a story about a story that didn't happen. Don't have it turn out to be a dream. Don't have it turn out to be a time loop that gets closed off so that none of it happened. Don't have it turn out to be a hallucination to cover up something that the character can't handle. You've wasted my time at that point.<br /><br />And, in Life of Pi, it reduces the only interesting part of the movie to the 30-40 minutes that happen before the storm. Then it's over. And that was hardly a story and one in which nothing really happened other than that someone survived a horrible stranding at sea.<br /><br />And, sure, you can get all wrapped up in discussions about whether the tiger was God or what the heck was that island supposed to be, anyway, or whether he just made up the story he told the insurance people about the cook just so that they would have something they could grasp, but none of it matters. It doesn't matter because of the statement, &#34;Which is the better story, and wouldn't you rather believe that thing than believe the truth?&#34;<br /><br />So, yeah, sure, Pi was pretty. It deserved the awards it got for those aspects of the movie, but it certainly wasn't a &#34;best directed&#34; movie. It was a hardly directed movie. I'm glad I watched it; I even kind of wish I'd seen it on the big screen just for some of the scenes on the ocean; but I don't think it was a great movie. It might look all deep when looking down on it, but, if you put your feet in, you'll find it's just a wading pool.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I tried to get this on my Kindle Fire... but it wouldn't download.... I was so excited about the game.... and I could just cry right now....
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This masterfully written book full of quotes from those who know \\"The Secret\\" is very motivational and presents a simple program.  I was delighted with the book and the ideas given.  I intend to put them to work right away!
B003K16P3M|5.0|A very well, and smooth, book.. Tells the story while still leaving you hanging. A recommended book for all ages.
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|There is much to learn here however, I was wondering whether there are moments where people assume a role as a taker  or matcher vs. the preferable giver role?  Are there occasions where it is best to act as a taker or matcher vs. a giver?  Are there job positions where it is best to operate as a taker or matcher, than a giver?  Although these questions are left unanswered, I still recommend this read highly.
B009K916ZK|4.0|Am yet to use this device. But I believe it will be what it promises based on my experience with a similar device for iPad.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this app. Has so many ways to earn cash without paying your real money. This is the best city app that I have seen.
0525953728|4.0|This is going deep into the heart of the American war on terrorism. I love the show of patriotism by these soldiers.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Read this book in one day. Laughed to the point of tears. It is written from the male point of view from a women writer but after learning she too is a Jersey girl I know why I loved her. Seriously I have read over 150 books in this genre and this was great definitely worth th  time and did not disappoint. I LOVED IT!  I will go to sleep with a smile on my face.
1451695195|5.0|Very matured presentation of the author's experiences. This evidence of life after death is more convincing for skeptics, coming from a highly educated medical scientist (brain surgeon) and a previous skeptic himself. I like his way of just presenting what he experienced and leaving the reader to make up her/his mind. A beautiful piece recommended to all.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I just got it and I can not stop playing. battleing is so fun. I also love the battle lottery!  GET THIS GAME!!!!!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is by far the best game for my kindle fire the graphics are awesome and the storyline I really love this game. I really suggest you guys pay and download this game is WORTH IT!!!!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This (double) CD features many songs that cover the span of the Beach Boys entire career. The sound quality is perfect and the vocals are brought forward, making the harmonies clean and crisp. I like the fact that the talking between the songs is edited and kept to a minimum, thus really emphasizing the music. There was still room on each disc to include even more songs (20 minutes on the first disc and 10 minutes or so on the second disc), but I'm not complaining. This is an EXCELLENT CD set. It's much better than the edited DVD which (in my opinion) did not have good sound quality and felt like you were watching rapidly changing picture frames instead of feeling like you were experiencing a live concert.<br /><br />It would have been nice had the accompanying booklet been more informative, perhaps showing all the concert tour dates, and which tour each of the songs were taken from for this album. (Yes-I know all the tour information is available online.)<br /><br />Of course the MUSIC is the most important thing here and this album DELIVERS the goods. So \\"Add Some Music to Your Day\\" and buy this album! You won't be disappointed.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I did not like this game at all. Extremely boring and when you fly a plane or helicopter the game does not cooperate. Very disappointing.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The case protects the Kindle and works well. The case is nice looking and has not presented any negatives to date.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game. You should make more games like this one. Can you retire more game like this to me.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Rotate your work as you select on the fly... I use mine for Solidworks. why didn't I get this sooner.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|The most frustrating thing about this movie for me was the thought of how good it could have been if they left out all the Hollywood clich&eacute;s, especially when it came to the lead female role (of course she likes beer, thinks sex with women is hot, and does one of the most overdone Hollywood moves of slapping the man across the face).<br />Also, if you are like me and have a family member with mental illness and you've dealt with the reality of this...you really need to separate that reality and how this movie portrays mental illness in order to enjoy the movie.  If you are able to do that, the movie is enjoyable to watch.  I do not see at all though how it was considered award-worthy.  I expected so much more from it because I read of all the awards but when I watched it I couldn't figure out what about it deserved an award. If they would have had the conviction to make the movie about mental illness and put more emotional depth and honesty into it, I could understand awards.  But this movie didn't go there, it was mental illness light complete with Hollywood ending.  I like Jennifer Lawrence, but I didn't think her acting was anything special in this role.  I felt it stayed on the surface a little too much, but it's also a matter of that's what the script called for.  I think she would have been capable of going a lot deeper in a believable way if the script had called for that but it didn't.<br /><br />If you are offended by foul language, this has plenty of it.  Minimal sex/nudity...nothing to make a person squirm.  A brief shower nudity scene from the rear that was relative to the scene and during the dancing competition there are a couple revealing outfits but it's very brief and if you've ever watched Dancing with the Stars it's tame by comparison.
B00CPZ7DBW|1.0|this game shut down my hole kindle fire and now someone scammed my acount :( don't get this game thank for reading:)
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|don't  get this app it made me pay a lot of money when i was not even buying any thing DON'T GET THIS APP its horibble
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Good family fun.  Not a bad start for the series of movies that will follow.  More than likely some of the actors won't sign up and will be replaced.  Always a problem when you use big names for this type of movie
B007HE8XIS|5.0|I had not heard or knew much about Anoushka Shankar except she is the daughter of the late sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. However, after listening to this album I have become a fan of hers. The fusion of Indian classical music with Spanish music makes this a great experience. It's a joy to listen to, excellent music, great artist.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|It works just like the models from the 70's and will be used just as little.  You buy this with good ideas and then you get tired of it fast.  But if you're going to do it then this is a good model to buy.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Simple yet deep story driven game. Plenty of action and plotting of strategy. Never a dull moment.  Definite must download!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Ok, so I'll admit it is a fun game, but there's no end to levels, no end to the game, and the only thing you do in the game is run through a subway. There's no<br />Mini games or anything, but it is an addicting game and I do suggest getting it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's so cool I like how you can get money really easily I also like how it doesn't cost a lot to upgrade
075669812X|5.0|This Encyclopedia is being read and re-read by my 6 year-old grandson.  He is a big Ninjago and Lego fan.  He studies it like he was going to be tested.  He enjoys it, especially since he is learning to read, and loves to show us new things he has found in the book.  The pages are bright and colorful and packed-full of pictures.  The green Ninjago figure, that is included, was a plus for him too!

B009AMANBA|4.0|Great Movie.  Its hard to go wrong when Lincoln is the lead character.  The guy was dramatic, and thank the Lord he was, because you needed a dramatic guy to win the Civil War. The Civil War was a 1860's Off Broadway, Theatrical Show, and Lincoln loved the Theater and The Civil War was his stage.<br /><br />If you want to watch a short version (39 min.) of this movie get yourself a copy of the short film \\"Lincoln In The White House (1939).\\"  Its the same movie in Cliff Notes Version. Some Historical problems like Conn never voted against 13th Amendment

The battery life is no lie. They can get me through an entire day or two without having to be recharged. The headset is also very clear, and has a nice red LED light to tell you whether or not you have yourself muted. The volume control on the side is also a big plus.<br /><br />Great buy overall for anyone looking for a wireless headset suited for listening to music, Skyping with friends, or gaming.

B00C32R64G|5.0|One could easily make the argument that in 2013, modern rock radio is reaching the saturation point that we experienced in 1990 or so with Motley Jovi and the rest of their hair band brothers in spandex.  Their level of over-exposure on the airwaves and MTV paved the way for the Alt-rock and Grunge revolution of 1991.  Bands like Trixter, Tyketto and Lynch Mob came at the tail end of that scene and despite being composed of talented players who wrote solid music, they were lost in the tidal wave that washed away the old guard and transformed local punk rock kids into flannel flying rock icons. So while the industry continues to crank out a seemingly endless chain of KidNickelDusts, clearly what we need to do is to start importing hard rock bands from Denmark who sound like the sonic love child of Metallica and Godsmack, right?<br /><br />Yes, yes we do.<br /><br />Volbeat return in 2013 with 'Outlaw Gentleman and Shady Ladies,' the follow-up to their 2010 release 'Beyond Hell/Above Heaven.'  Stop for a second and simply take in the fact that less than three years have passed since Volbeat gave us their breakthrough record.  That's somewhat remarkable, especially given the fact that the last Tool and Metallica LPs were released when we had a different President.  That 'Outlaw' is essentially a non-stop anthem that embraces American hard rock's soaring power chorus' and tidy song structure, while deftly incorporating the darker thematic elements and technical guitar solos typically reserved for heavy metal, effectively separates this band from those whom they clearly draw so much inspiration from.<br /><br />What's done right here is done really right.  The majority of the tracks on 'Outlaw' adhere to a Western theme, complete with galloping drum rolls (Dead But Rising, Black Bart), harmonicas (Let's Shake Some Dust), and even a bit of Banjo (Doc Holliday). What could have come off as kind of gimmicky and inauthentic feels rather like a concept album in which we are offered a glimpse of what the old west would have sounded like had Les Paul and Jim Marshall been born 200 years earlier.  The non-traditional instruments are wisely incorporated into some of the album's strongest tracks, as opposed to separating them into experimental dittys of their own; a move that certainly would have made the theme feel like an afterthought rather than a starting point.<br /><br />Though Volbeat is composed of very competent players, now including Antharx alum Rob Caggiano on lead guitar, it's Michael Poulsen's lead vocals that rightfully take center stage on 'Outlaw'.  With the power and presence of David Draiman and Sully Erna coupled with the range, inflection and delivery of James Hetfield, Poulsen sings with commanding authority on every track here.  The up-lifting chorus' on 'Pearl Hart' and 'Lola Montez;' the later with its almost Jimmy Eat World-esgue infectious, joyful groove, are turned into absolute power anthems through Poulsen's voice.  Even the jock jam cover of Young The Giant's 'My Body' is a guilty pleasure thanks to Poulsen and his ability to sell, \\"My body tells me no/ But I won't quit 'cause I want more\\". Lead vocals are shared with King Diamond on 'Room 24', a brilliant and dark piece of metal that finds Poulsen standing shoulder to shoulder with the banshee wail of King Diamond as they trade verses before the song descends into vintage Black Sabbath electric evil. 'Lonesome Rider' features vocals from Sarah Blackwood and is a much lighter track in which Blackwood's voice is somewhat monotone and disengaged in the verses. Pity, as the chorus is positively alive with major chords and an impassioned vocal from Poulsen.<br /><br />So the take away from this album should be two-fold.  One, it's never too soon to follow up a great album with another great album.  Two, modern rock is a long, long way from burning itself out.  'Outlaw Gentleman and Shady Ladies' is a compelling reason to turn on your terrestrial radio, call up theDJ (who has been ordered under penalty of death to play Halestorm and Nickelback every hour), and request some Danish hard metal... or heavy rock.  Whichever.DJ (who has been ordered under penalty of death to play Halestorm and Nickelback every hour), and request some Danish hard metal... or heavy rock.  Whichever.

B00BPA2PBG|5.0|Know somethin\\"? I know people that STILL have THIS movie on \\"full-screen\\" versions... on VHS and DVD!<br /><br />This IS a very, very, very WIDESCREEN movie. A 2.40:1 aspect ratio film, even ON a widescreen TV, will have<br />large black bars above and below the image. I am STILL explaining to people that \\"prefer the entire movie<br />WITHOUT black bars\\" that they only have HALF the movie. Even after showing the film side-by-side, on TWO<br />TVs, and pointing out that DAN AYKROYD and BILL MURRAY are always in the middle so that the other TWO<br />Ghostbusters can get cut-off --- and out --- the sides [and their scenes].<br /><br />To make a long story short... BUY it ALL... GET it ALL! SEE it ALL!<br /><br />Four Kay is okay!
B007WULJ5G|4.0|I was quite happy to finally be able to get an uncut version compatible with US dvd players, so I ordered the cardboard bloody jewel case version of this film, its listed as English dub but its spoken in Serbian with english subtitles with no way to change it, Thought I would do a review because I did not read anyone else mentioning that in their review, when you click on audio during the movie its even listed as English but is indeed not. As far as the movie I see a lot of hatred for this film calling it garbage and so forth, that is not the case at all and I believe people are so taken back by the visual occurrences that I think they miss the political aspect of the film and dont quite understand the possibility of these very things being very common in third world countries...this film is shot very nicely and does not come across as low budget, the plot is insanity and the way its presented is crazy to, its definitely a work of art that I believe is very misunderstood solely based on shock value. I would give this movie 5 stars if it was actually dubbed in English like it stated and for that fact alone I have taken away a star just for this particular product.

B008JFUP0I|4.0|I haven't always had a love affair with the F&F series.  I thought the first one was pretty dumb, hated the second, and never saw the third.  The fourth drew me in - I rented it at some point and found it really entertaining.  Then, they brought in The Rock for the fifth, and I knew I had to see it.  Justin Lin made a near perfect action movie with Fast Five, including one of the best action movie sequences (as unbelievable as it may be) of all time with the safe steal.  That heightened my expectations for Fast & Furious 6.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way first - this movie has a terrible, terrible script.  The dialogue is beyond horrible, to the point of eye rolling, and there are plot holes galore.  However, you don't go into a F&F movie expecting to see a great script or natural dialogue - you go in to see over the top action set pieces, fast cars, and butt kicking...and on those notes, it hits on all cylinders.<br /><br />There isn't anything in this movie that tops the stolen safe from Fast Five, but a scene featuring a tank on a freeway comes pretty damn close.  The finale is also really intense, but I wish it would have been shot during the day instead of night, because a lot of what's going on is hard to see.  I understand it was probably done for editing purposes, but a lot of it was just so confusing during the end.  We get to see a lot of classic cars, testosterone, and explosions - overall, it's just a really fun movie, as ridiculous as it may be at points.<br /><br />Don't get out of your seat right after the movie ends.  There's a scene at the end that is surprising and amazing.<br /><br />Final Score: 4/5

0399159347|4.0|The Husband's Secret is a novel about love and relationships between husbands and wives, parents and their children, and grandparents and grandchildren.  One husband in the story has a horrible, terrifying secret, but everyone in the book something to hide.  Cecilia is the perfect wife and mother, super organized and over achieving, but her life falls apart when she reads a letter her husband wrote to her to be read in the case of his death.  Tess is a successful career woman, a loving mother, and a loyal friend who is stunned by the betrayal of her husband and best friend.  Rachel's life changed one fateful day years ago when her teen-aged daughter Janie was murdered.<br /><br />These three women are loosely bound together, having grown up in the same town, encountering each other at the local school and school events, and having friends in common.  They are thrust into each others lives when fate delivers blows that each is spectacularly unprepared to deal with.  The story unfurls in a compelling way, with the writer fully engaging the reader in thoughts and desires of each woman.  Events are viewed from the perspective of each of the women, and their different thoughts and opinions are authentic and believable.  The terrible events force each of the three women to question themselves and their motivations, only to discover that perhaps they've also been deceiving themselves.<br /><br />The Husband's Secret is a serious book built on the themes of love, deceit, and betrayal viewed through the perspective of wives and mothers.  The story is engaging and well written, with smooth transitions between characters and events, and worthwhile pleasure to read.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are some book where you can intuit the ending, but the author does a great job building up a climax.  Those are the good stories, and they are rare.  Then along comes a story which unfolds brilliantly, each new segment feeling like a complete saga, with enough of a surprise ending to make you wonder, just what else is out there?  Then the next segment blows your mind even further, but in a believable way, with characters you identify with, and not just the heroes, but the villains as well.  Simply awesome.

B0001Z363W|4.0|Hangover Music Vol. VI, from 2004, is the fifth full-length studio album by the American Heavy Metal band Black Label Society. This is stylistically an atypical album by the band, in that for the most part it is essentially an acoustic album.<br /><br />The record is a proper studio album that contains a set of new songs (as opposed to reworking existing Black Label Society songs for a sort of acoustic compilation or MTV Unplugged sort of release).<br /><br />Some of the tracks are slow, emotional piano ballads, some of the tracks are acoustic guitar ballads, and some are semi-acoustic rock songs (a few of which even feature distorted electric guitar). One of the tracks is an all acoustic guitar solo, like the band usually stick on a studio album to break things up and one of the tracks is a cover of Procol Harum's `Whiter Shade Of Pale.'<br /><br />Newcomers may be skeptical of how well a band like Black Label Society, famous for guitar tricks and low pitched chugging riffs, could pull off an acoustic album, but in my opinion this is actually a very good release, and actually contains two or three of the very best songs that the band ever released.<br /><br />Highlights include the opener `Crazy Or High?' as well as the brilliantly emotional `Stepping Stone' with its big doomy bells, and `House Of Doom' which is one of the catchiest tracks in the band's whole catalougue.<br /><br />Overall; Hangover Music is a surprisingly enjoyable and accomplished effort, that may be atypical of the band's usual output, but which is definitely worth checking out.
B00367XA1K|4.0|This is a superbly done film about someone who isn't that widely known (nearly 100 years later), but who witnessed some of the most momentous events of the early 20th century.  Although it can be a bit tedious at times, it provides some wonderful insight to the left-wing intellectual movement following World War I.  I think if these people had lived into the 1960s or 70s, they would not have found Soviet-style socialism so appealing.  But one can appreciate their desire to bring an end to the causes of war.  Students of history need to see this film.
B007IX383I|5.0|Anathema are a British modern Progressive Rock band, who started their career as a Death-Doom band in the early nineties. Their 2012 album Weather Systems was my entry point to the band, and since its release I have constantly listened to it, over and over, absorbing more and more of its obvious entertainment factor and its hidden depths. It got me hooked on the band and started me off getting more of their albums.<br /><br />The record starts off with the fantastic `Untouchable' which is an incredibly powerful and interesting track that constantly builds up, its got brilliant evocative lyrics and an emotionally charged mixture of male and female vocals. This is followed by the bittersweet piano driven `Untouchable Prt 2.' From then on the album goes through a range of different moods and atmospheres, from light to dark, happy to sad. There's strings, spoken word sections, acoustic sounds, electronicy glitching and more, and its all topped off with deep intriguing lyrics and a crystal clear production job.<br /><br />Highlights include the aforementioned Untouchables as well as the fantastic `Sunlight' and `The Beginning And The End' although to be fair there is absolutely no filler, the record is a strong journey from beginning to end.<br /><br />There are some naysayers to the album out there, most of whom are either caught out by an album they expected to be heavy but wasn't, or are fans of the band's early days and don't like the new direction. I can see how very different this is to anything the band did at the start of their career, and if you came in expecting something that sounds like early My Dying Bride or Paradise Lost then it may be disappointing, as there is nothing in the way of Death or Doom on offer here at all, but this is an extremely enjoyable, masterfully crafted modern Progressive Rock album, full of interesting, inventive tracks that flows really well as an album and that just grows and grows with every listen.<br /><br />If you are a fan of bands like Porcupine Tree, Riverside, Tool, Rishloo, Amplifier or even bands like The Mars Volta, Coheed & Cambria or Dream Theater, you may at least want to check this album out.<br /><br />Overall; Since I first heard it, I've grown extremely fond of this record, its got some of my favourite ever songs on it and I highly, highly recommend it, if you think you might like it.ands like Porcupine Tree, Riverside, Tool, Rishloo, Amplifier or even bands like The Mars Volta, Coheed & Cambria or Dream Theater, you may at least want to check this album out.<br /><br />Overall; Since I first heard it, I've grown extremely fond of this record, its got some of my favourite ever songs on it and I highly, highly recommend it, if you think you might like it.

Very few books make me want to stay up all night to finish and at the same time wish the book wouldn't end. This was one of them. I have been waiting a long time for another book from this author. It was worth the wait.

Come to find out I liked the books WAY better than the series. I am sad that this series is ending but it did end in a good way. Thank you Mrs Harris for a great ride!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Let me begin by explaining this book has changed my entire philosophy on reading. I am not a reader - I have never been a reader. This is a fact that has caused great frustration to my family as they have tried to convince me to pick up books since I was a child with little success. I'm certainly capable of reading and even concentrated in English in college as I love writing and literary analysis, but something about actually reading a book has never appealed to me. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed reading some books, but I've just never quite understood why so many people can find them so profoundly life changing. And then I picked up The Fault in Our Stars.<br /><br />I picked up this book on a whim. I decided I had free time and so I may as well make an attempt to read something. The plot summary appealed to me and so I grabbed The Fault in Our Stars. I was pretty immediately hooked.<br /><br />Green's writing is positively exquisite. This is the type of book that SHOULD be placed in the hands of teens because he tells a story that they can relate to but does not dumb anything down for them. The language is rich, the characters are well-developed, and the reader will undoubtedly be enamored with them by the end; even at 24, I am.<br /><br />I noticed a number of people saying that this isn't realistic, that this is not how teenagers talk. With the exception of Kaitlyn (who Green describes as &#34;an extremely sophisticated twenty-five-year-old British socialite stuck inside a sixteen-year-old body&#34; - i.e. not meant to sound like a typical teen), I disagree. None of the characters ever felt fake to me and their way of speaking just made the already eccentric and unique characters more eccentric and unique, which was fitting. They are not meant to be the perfect depiction of teenagers; they are meant to be flawed (even Hazel and Augustus point out their hamartia). The language that's used by Augustus and Hazel is just another part of who they are.<br /><br />This book did, of course, make me cry - but not as much as some others that I've read and actually less than I anticipated. Certainly, The Fault in Our Stars is worth shedding more than a few tears for, but more than anything, it got me thinking. About life, about oblivion, about heartbreak, and in the choices we make (even when those choices hurt you). I think these thoughts are more important than the tears I shed and those I didn't shed. Still, Green is an absolute master at making you FEEL. There were times while reading this book that I was literally laughing out loud while crying and I don't know how anyone else could make the word &#34;okay&#34; turn into the most romantic word in the world.<br /><br />I'm already trying to choose which of Green's books to pick up next. Considering I've never been a reader and average maybe a book every six months, max, this is a major feat for me. The Fault in Our Stars made a reader out of me. It made me feel in the way that almost no books ever do. It made me fall in love with a fictional romance between two teenagers and want it to never end. It made me laugh, cry, and think.<br /><br />I truly believe this is a book worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they need the wisdom of an Augustus Waters and a Hazel Grace in their life./>This book did, of course, make me cry - but not as much as some others that I've read and actually less than I anticipated.

B000FBJAEG|3.0|Nothing new here.  Baldacci weaves complex plots within plots throughout all of his works and &#34;Split Second&#34; is no exception.  However, in my previous experience with this author I always found some thread of reality that seemed to always come slamming together in the last chapter or two. The 'thread&#34; didn't exist is this work leaving the reader struggling to figure out what had just occurred when the last page was read. We are fed a sampling of terrorism, psycho-drama, and a great deal of very confusing mystery that somehow is suppose to all tie together.  Well it never does and I happily finished the rat maze and moved onto another author.  Time to take a break Mr. Baldacci and get back to the type of work on which we have previously spent our money.  Stop experimenting and settle down into what you so best.
B004OR199G|4.0|I was looking for juice-diet books and started with this. I really like it, but can't do it. Carr has a very good pen, she writes like she is having a conversation with you personally. This is not only a diet book, she also takes you on a spiritual journey. She has a potty mouth - I like that a lot, but be warned if you have a problem with that. Her way into the world of juicing is a  serious illness. She goes from one extreme (too much processed food and bad habits) to the other (green juices and total vegan) and for Carr and her body this is the best solution. The book is packed with information. There's lots of really interesting facts about biology and scientific research, and Carr makes it easy for us &#34;regular folks&#34; to understand and process this information. Also we read real life testimonials - we all love those. The book is still a little too much for me though. I soon found out I would never be able to do 21 days, my diet was already pretty healthy and I was not interested in going vegan, anti-gluten, anti-coffee and anti-microwave. But if this is were you want to go - this book is perfect! It is also an excellent guide-book and can be used as such. Carr also has a lot of good advice on beauty (also the inner beauty ofcourse), body and looks. She's bringing sexy back - and it's green!
0061733199|5.0|This book was suggested by a co-worker for my bug out bag. I am not a dooms dayer or an extreme survivalist but I do believe in being prepared. This book covers more topics than several military books we have as reference/training  material.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is perfect for my style of play. I love being able to change the buttons to certain game's controls. The weight system is good too, and I really like the option of being able to adjust it by having more or less in. The DPI settings are also great, perfectly adjustable through the mouse itself or the program to your style of play. The only complaint I have is that I wish I could change more colors on the mouse other than just the logo, but thats just a minor complaint. The performance is spectacular and the mouse itself is excellently made. The mouse was shipped on time and in perfect condition. And Anker has great costumer service. I recommend this product and seller to any computer gamers.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|It's not the best because it's the first album. It's the best because every song works well in the album and all of them fit together. Not one song stands out as a bad song compared to the rest. It gets a 4/5 for that. It would get 5 if it was revolutionary. It's really great to listen to. Kind of one of those albums you turn on for a beach trip.

B00001R3GF|5.0|Probably the last Stones true Masterpiece. On the main album, Mick plays guitar on almost every song. The louder ones ('Whip') are mind blowing.  The second disc could've been a great album by itself (better than 'It's Only R&R', which I like). All perfectly finished tracks more in the vein of 'Let It Bleed' Era. They probably picked the ones that had a more contemporary sound at the time, but they must've had a hell of a time picking. Last record where Keith had great harmony and could do plaintive ballads as well as rockers \\"really\\" well. Record companies had really soured on double albums but taken as a whole this would've been a great one. Some have issues with the sound. I'm no audiophile but real picky. I confess I do most of my listening either in my car with a good sound system or on my iPod with high quality earbuds. I have no problem whatsoever with the sound. Not the pinacle of sound mastering/mixing but damn good. Ya gotta get this if you love the Stones. You won't be sorry.
B001UV4XUG|2.0|I'm shocked this romantic movie is receiving such high ratings. Hero is weak and so obviously not a match for spirited and pretty Zooey Deschanel. Yes ... this movie isn't your cookie-cutter romcom. It's far worse!!! At least silly movies like &#34;The Ugly Truth&#34; or &#34;Miss Congeniality&#34; are funny and uplifting albeit shallow. Watching &#34;500 Days&#34; is as fun as having a root canal. Inane dialogue and meandering plot will tempt you to fast forward.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled<br />By far one of the best and without a doubt the funniest book I have ever read.<br />Written in the man's POV with such humor and gusto I could not put this one down.<br />I had to know all there was to know about Drew Evans and Kate Brooks.<br />Drew the \\"prince\\" of his mother's eye, the powerful and strikingly handsome I-Banker,<br />the forever playboy that every woman dreams of taming. Not happening!<br /><br />\\"How about a drink?\\" she asks, in what I'm sure she thinks is a sultry voice. But here's<br />A fact for you--once I'm done, I'm done. I am not the kind of guy who rides the same<br />rollercoaster twice. Once is enough, and then the thrill is gone and so is the interest.<br /><br />Kate, the new associate at his firm quickly catches his eye, only Kate is engaged.<br />Think that will stop Drew in his pursuit of her, not happening!<br />Drew's take on life and dating will have you rolling around on the floor laughing<br />so loud your ribs will begin to hurt. Clever and amusing POV's that just get<br />better and better as the story progresses.<br /><br />\\"For those ladies out there who are listening, let me give you some free advice: If<br />a guy who you just met at a club calls you baby, sweetheart, angel or any other generic<br />endearment? Don't make the mistake of thinking he's into you, he's already thinking up<br />pet names. It's because he can't remember or doesn't care to remember your actual name\\".<br /><br />Brilliant work by the author, like reading a skit from Saturday Night Live, only it continues<br />throughout the book. Comedy, hot steamy sex and love all make for one fantastic book.<br /><br />Come along for the ride as Drew tells his story, you will not be disappointed!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is a really wonderful movie -- one of my all-time favorites -- too bad the volume it was recorded at is kinda low (took off a star)-- it makes the British accents harder to pick up for this American ear.<br /><br />Also there are definitely some adult themes, so be careful with the kids.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Love Actually\\" is a hilarious and heartwarming movie about all kinds of love. They were smart to chose a Christmas theme, so you'll want to revive it every year along with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\".

Can these two flawed halves create a unique whole?
B0025KVLT2|5.0|In many ways, this was the album that changed the course of the rock music industry. The Beatles, of course, had been THE group for several years by this point...1965...and this was their sixth studio album (in the U.K. - the U.S. market issued their albums differently), every one of them a huge hit. But what this album did for the group, as well as rock music, cannot be overstated.<br /><br />Recorded over a four-week period in the early winter of 1965, this album travelled in a totally new direction for them; where they had been singer-songwriters who turned out rockers and ballads with equal precision, RUBBER SOUL signaled the beginning of them as Artists. They were in the midst of their folk-rock stage, a continuation of the music that saw first light in [[ASIN:B0025KVLSS Help!]], with such songs as \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" and the more country-ish \\"I've Just Seen a Face.\\" It is an album that was almost universally acclaimed as an early pinnacle for the Beatles - in fact, for any group. It was ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine as Number 5 in their \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time,\\" it also made Time Magazine's \\"All-Time 100 Albums,\\" and received many other similar accolades.<br /><br />It began with the whimsical \\"Drive My Car,\\" a humorous piece that now often serves as the opening number of McCartney's act.  Next is the astoundingly good \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" a folk-rock piece which Lennon has often said was a disguised bit of autobiography about an affair he'd had on his wife Cynthia. It's the first Beatle song ever to feature George on sitar, an Indian instrument which would consume him as time went on; and it's a cleverly dark song that ends with the narrator burning down the flat of the woman who'd spurned his advances. \\"You Won't See Me\\" is next, again a darker song, especially for the more cheerful McCartney. Supposedly, it relates his unpleasant state after realizing his relationship with Jane Asher was beginning to end - a theme of more than one song on this album.<br /><br />Where they went next, however, was simply amazing: Lennon's \\"Nowhere Man\\" was the first of his purely philosophical statements on the nature of man - or at least A man, though he would never claim any specific target. It represented what would be a growing theme with Lennon, and the Beatles in general: a song commenting on people's failings, one that would serve as a mantra for so many young people growing up in the 60s, believing that man's material nature was ephemeral and wasteful...taking aim at anyone who spent their lives being \\"blind...just see(ing) what (they) want to see.\\"  It seemed to speak to so many disaffected youth, believing that there were so many in society who could do something about their lives but refused to take the lead. Yet where Lennon really hit his mark was the line: \\"Isn't he a bit like you and me?\\" It was classic Lennon: taking aim at himself (and us) as well, refusing simply to blame others. Along these same lines was Harrison's \\"Think for Yourself,\\" the Quiet One's first protest song in the sense that it admonished against those who preferred to \\"Hide their heads in the sand\\"; yet his song was more optimistic than Lennon's, saying, \\"The future still looks good, and you've got time to rectify all the things that you should. \\"<br /><br />Though the next song was rather bland stylistically, it did represent what would be a driving mantra in the Beatles' music: Love, not just in its romantic sense, but in the sense of being good to one another...Make Love, in other words, Not War.  Next was McCartney's ballad \\"Michelle,\\" which won the Grammy for Song of the Year.  Yet, despite its sweet message, its singer would later admit that he wrote it to woo girls at after parties...they tended to swoon, he said, when they heard him speak French.<br /><br />Side B (elders, explain it to those younger than you) began with the throwaway country song \\"What Goes On,\\" a song written specifically for Ringo, who had his specific audience too. Next was the very beautiful, but very dark, \\"Girl,\\" attributed to Lennon; it was about a manipulative woman who knew how to work her man in order to get what she wanted from him.  Lennon (who later said some of the words were inspired by his negative feelings toward Christianity) tells the story of \\"the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry; still, you don't regret a single day.\\" Happy, right?  But it concludes that her nature is NOT to be kind; in fact, her need for material goods kept her man so busy meeting her needs that he warns...\\" a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure...will she still believe it when he's dead?\\"<br /><br />McCartney was next, again commenting on the downturn in his and Jane Asher's relationship in \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" wherein he concludes that \\"You don't look different, but you have changed.\\"  After this, however, is the stunningly good and quite moving \\"In My Life,\\" a Lennon tune so sublime and so tender that there was a continual friendly dispute over who contributed what and how much to this song.  Regardless, it's a heartfelt and sublime work, and in true Beatles' creative fashion the baroque-sounding harpsichord is really a piano played by producer George Martin, sped up so that its reverberations make it sound classical.  \\"Wait\\" follows, a sweet song about romance between people forced to be far apart - which would sound sweeter if so much on this album did not have to do with breakups and affairs.<br /><br />The last two songs on the album are Harrison's second (his arrangement with his more famous songwriting counterparts was that he got one song per \\"side\\" of their albums), and a song Lennon considered a throwaway piece.  Harrison's was \\"If I Needed Someone,\\" a strange song with an even stranger lyric: he starts off by assuring a star-crossed admirer that, \\"If I needed someone to love, you're the one that I'd be thinking of.\\" While he's \\"too much in love\\" to seriously consider her request, he doesn't want her to give up on him entirely; no, he tells his mystery admirer to \\"Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me.\\" A strange way to express sentimentality, to be sure.<br /><br />The album concludes with what Lennon alleged to be his least favorite song of his Beatle career: \\"Run For Your Life.\\" It is, admittedly, a very dark song (though Harrison declared it to be one of his most favorite of Lennon's), that begins with the lines, \\"Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man...\\" one of the few Beatles songs to be downright threatening...referring to his lover as \\"Little Girl\\" is also taken to be misogynistic or at least demeaning.  It's an odd song to end with on an otherwise stellar album, one that is considered to be an example of the Beatles breaking away from purely pop songs to those expressive of an identity that would set them apart from other groups, and also to set the bar for other groups to try to achieve.  No longer were rock groups going to simply put out twelve songs just to put them out...no, with RUBBER SOUL the Beatles established a level of musical and lyrical integrity that was going to continuously challenge other groups to keep up.<br /><br />Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, in fact, often spoke of this album (and, next, [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]) as the one he wrote PET SOUNDS for...he and other groups realized that the Beatles were after a level of artistic achievement heretofore achieved, much less even HOPED to achieve, in musical performance.  It was an album that also established the first of the many \\"identities\\" of the Beatles...the folk-rockers; then the psychedelia, the start of Heavy Metal, the \\"Concept\\" Album, the Counterculture Anti-Establishment-ers, and so on.  They were on their way to establishing the music video, the rock group as political statesmen, the Studio Artists who refused to go on tour, the rise of Indian music, and the Anti-War Activists.  They were so many things, but ultimately it all came repeatedly back to their talent, their supremely clever lyrics, and their continual efforts at reinventing themselves, constantly changing in front of our eyes, refusing to allow others to characterize them.<br /><br />They were, after all was said and done, the Beatles...and this album - RUBBER SOUL - was the one that many believe started them on their way.est, he doesn't want her to give up on him entirely; no, he tells his mystery admirer to \\"Carve your number on my wall and maybe you will get a call from me.\\" A strange way to express sentimentality, to be sure.<br /><br />The album concludes with what Lennon alleged to be his least favorite song of his Beatle career: \\"Run For Your Life.\\" It is, admittedly, a very dark song (though Harrison declared it to be one of his most favorite of Lennon's), that begins with the lines, \\"Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl, than to be with another man...\\" one of the few Beatles songs to be downright threatening...referring to his lover as \\"Little Girl\\" is also taken to be misogynistic or at least demeaning.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really liked this game. The graphics were awesome but it was super short and the story line was a little confusing at times. I think for the length of the game, it should not cost 2 bucks. Hopefully they will add some more levels soon because it is fun and it ended abruptly.

193700788X|2.0|(Spoilers!)  I loved this series until the last book or so.  In fact, for the first time in the past decade, I wasn't even excited for May to roll around so I could get my annual Sookie fix.  I had a feeling I wouldn't like the turn the story was taking, and I was right.<br /><br />I realize the series is not strictly &#34;romance&#34; and I shouldn't get too hung up on who Sookie &#34;ended up with.&#34;  Nonetheless, the romance was a part of the storyline (and more interesting than the descriptions of her dinner menus and trips to Walmart).  It wasn't too surprising that Sookie and Eric parted ways.  After all, Sookie is a traditional girl who likes the sun and a quiet life.  I was surprised, however, that Sookie seemed so indifferent to the breakup and that Eric was so callous about it.  They both seemed so out of character.  If Sookie and Eric were actually indifferent to each other, I completely missed that over the past 9 or so books.  I also missed that Sam and Sookie were meant to be together.  For me, there was no real buildup to any relationship with Sam other than a friendship.  The double-wide trailer sex with Sam was awkward and super unsexy (and thrown in at the last minute like checking off a list?).  Ugh, Sam, really?!<br /><br />The entire book felt off.  The new narrative style (with perspectives other than those of Sookie) was interesting but out character for the series.  The basic premise was convoluted... everyone get Sookie at the same time!  And why did Amelia's dumb dad wish for an item on which to make a wish?  Why not just make his dumb wish?!  And to resent Sookie for his own stupidity was an unbelievable plot device.  Also, almost every character ever seen in the whole series was either brought in or mentioned, which made for a very crowded, disjointed story.<br /><br />In sum, this was a really disappointing conclusion to the series for me.  It had been heading downhill, and this last book was just the final kick in the head.  I'm gladit's over because I couldn't endure this another year.  Unless...  and call me a glutton for punishment... there was some postscript that said where everyone was in X number of years.  I'd really like to know what happened to everyone, and the final book didn't satisfy that.  Never mind, I'm definitely asking for trouble.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I really liked this season.  It was brilliantly written, the season finale was awesome.  I can't wait to see what happens in season 9.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I'm a 31 year old avid reader. I loved Harry Potter, Twilight, Mortal Instruments, and Hunger Games all which became movies. Movies never live up to the novels, yet usually I still enjoy seeing how the books are adapted even if the acting is poor or some of my favorite parts have to be cut. Seeing the rating of this movie almost kept me from renting it, but then I read the reviews. Almost all of the bad reviews were people who were disappointed it didn't keep with the original story line. Well I never read the book, so I didn't know what I was missing. I was captivated beginning to end. Yes, I did notice a bad southern accent at the beginning, which I probably wouldn't have noticed if another review hadn't pointed that out. And yes there is a scene where she pours tea and obviously nothing comes out of the pot and the cup is empty. But I only noticed those things because I was looking for them based on other reviews. Within 10 minutes I had forgotten the reviews and didn't notice any other &#34;little&#34; thing, because the story was captivating and fun. A great coming of age story. Just like Harry Potter has to chose to use his magic for good or evil or like Edward Cullen's has to struggle against his vampire instincts, the main character struggles between good and evil and who she really is and what good and evil mean. It's a beautiful story full of love, and awesome fantasy. A must see for any fantasy freak such as myself!

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Captivating. I couldn't put the book down. As entertaining as angles and demons, deception point, the divinchi code and digital fortress. This book will paint a vivid portrait in your mind of then story he created.  Definitely worth it.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I like how it's like Minecraft but they need to update it more and stuff like a real nether and more mobs and finally add redstone. By that I mean levers, buttons, pressure plates, redstone torches and make redstone actually ae to be picked up when you mine it. Another thing to add is cheats like /tp and /gamemode.One more thing to add would be actual multiplayer servers not only LAN.

B003HZGT32|5.0|More than just growled lyrics! I, too, think that death metal can be somewhat monotonous. Growled lyrics, boring guitar riffs repeated over and over, overuse of double bass... But Insomnium breaks the melodic death metal mold and has created an album I have listened to over a hundred times, and will probably listen to another hundred times before I have to finally put it down for a while.<br /><br />While I enjoyed their previous albums, particularly \\"Since the Day It All Came Down,\\" \\"Across the Dark\\" blows them all out of the water with a few subtle changes. One, they have more sung passages that complement the usual growls. Second, the acoustic or otherwise quieter passages are far more interesting than previously. Now, the song actually progresses, instead of just repeating the same riff but with acoustic guitar. And lastly, this album has more atmosphere than all their previous albums combined. These changes, along with the band's usual talent, push this album to epic.<br /><br />If you're buying your first Insomnium album, I'd start with this one, then move on to \\"One for Sorrow\\" if you like what you hear.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I'll be honest. I purchased this so that I could include it with the kindle that I sold on Ebay. I figure it does what it's supposed to do. How wrong can you go. I never heard anything negative from the buyer so it must have worked just fine.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent segue from books 1 & 2. Showcases that good triumphs over evil and even though there is great cost along the way, the ending is at a place where you figured it would be but weren't sure that it would actually arrive there. A really good read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this book for 99 cents as a filler between books I wanted to read and so it sat, kind of like a bench player in baseball, waiting for me to find it. What a mistake. This book is an all star. It's a wonderful adventure story first and foremost, but what really makes this a must read is the authors sense of humor. There are times when you're sitting on the edge of your seat filled with tension and the next moment you're laughing out loud. I mean literally laughing out loud. Buy this book. Read this book.
0307454541|2.0|Way too much extraneous information for a detective novel.  I felt like the author wasted my time giving unnecessary details that did not contribute to the mystery at all.

B00821OX98|3.0|I would have rated it higher if I was not an arms tech. Too many flaws regarding the weapons technology sorta took the edge off for me. But most folks would not pick up on it. Perhaps its good for four stars otherwise. Still, it's a fun watch.
B009NY43NY|1.0|The dedicated fan that I am, I never said anything bad about the last few books of the series, though all the fans and readers have agreed that the quality of the books started to decline at book 9. I admired Charlaine for sticking to what she wanted to happen. She explained that her characters are her characters and that she knows what they would do better than anyone else. So I respect that she ended the series with Sookie and Sam, but the way she went about it is just all wrong.<br /><br />1. Since when has it made sense to introduce a new writing style when concluding a series? After 12 books, sticking to Sookie's POV would have made readers more comfortable. Not to mention less confused.<br /><br />2. Wasn't the whole plot of Deadlocked, book 12, more or less about Claude wanting revenge? Claude's revenge being behind yet another book was kind of lame.<br /><br />3. The characters did not seem like themselves. As previously stated, Charlaine said she could do whatever she wanted with her characters - but people have been reading her books for 12 years. By now we have gotten to know them, so changing their traits and personalities just to create the Sam and Sookie ending doesn't work.<br /><br />4. Eric. WHERE WAS ERIC? I don't believe the reason why this book is so hated is because Sookie and Eric didn't end up together. It's how it was done. The fact that after we grew to understand them and their relationship so well, that it was ended in such a far-fetched way. Their obsession and infatiation of each other built up over almost all 12 books of the series. To write Eric off as if he wasn't an important character is unfair to the readers. He said about two sentences before his character was completely brushed off and out of the book. And Sookie was okay with it? After all the time they spent forming their relationship, are we supposed to be happy with him being written off like he was nothing? Neither him nor Sookie seemed like themselves, otherwise they wouldn't have been so indifferent to the break up of what I thought was an important part of the series. I think Eric deserved more of a part in the last book, and that a little bit more than Ocella's deal and Sookie's hurt over the divorce was needed to break up what I thought was a strong relationship. He was such an important character, the fact he was hardly in it is understandably why people oppose this book so passionately.<br /><br />I truly respect Charlaine and how she wanted to end her book, but it didn't really make sense. Her characters weren't themselves and there seemed to be no thought behind the end of one of the only things that kept readers reading - Eric and Sookie's relationship. After making their relationship so strong and central to the story, their break up was too easy. Charlaine should have broken them up over something believeable and understandable, and should have created more of a reaction to it. I mean, after all that time, it's hard to believe neither of them we're crushed. There was no closure to the best part of the story, which in my opinion didn't deserve to be rushed.<br /><br />Even though they're called \\"Sookie Stackhouse Novels\\", Eric was an extremely dominant character. The wrapping up of the series should have been more focused on important characters like him and less on some weird mystery that intertwines a bunch of non-important ones. I wish Charlaine had paid a little respect to the readers who were so invested in the relationship before completely obliterating it and the best character of the series.<br /><br />Disappointment after reading and re-reading 12 books sucks.<br /><br />I hope Sam and Sookie enjoy a lifetime of hot seal sex.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I did not realize this was a musical. Was hard wrapping my brain around a Marvel Comic hero singing along with the Gladiator! Once I was able to get past that the story drew me in. Nice work on an old classic.
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|In the words of the author, they cannot guarantee that the pattern/system they teach in the book will always lead to successful change but they believe that all successful change follows this pattern.<br /><br />This pattern is broken into three parts. Direct the rider (give clear instruction), motivate the elephant (show the incentives), and show the path.<br /><br />Of the many great principles they teach in the book I especially loved the idea of finding bright spots. The authors suggest that if you want to change people in a group you need to find the few people who already show the correct/new behaviors and duplicate what they are doing and help others see it can be done.<br /><br />This is one of many core principles that are part of a pattern of effective change. Read the book and you will be more empowered to effect individual, group, organizational, or societal change.

B004UOE7VA|5.0|The Reconfigured tracks are very good. Some are a little harder to tell where the original track is, but all enrich what has been my favorite music purchase this year. You won't find the more orchestrated tracks from the original,  but yu will have more beats, bass, and layers.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This one was my favorite app to play Jewels until I found Bejeweled from EA. I play Bejeweled on the Ipad so now I prefer that game instead of this one. It is free so it has some ads.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a book I did not think I would be interested in reading but it turned out to be compelling.  This book and the second book in the series were the best.  Not unlike some other trillogies the third book took me the longest to read.  If you read the first book you will definitely want to read the second and third.  Much intrigue and political / social angst.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I had a warning message from the antivirus. I dislike apps that take many resources, or run shady programs in the background.
B002YVAT72|2.0|Sold as new but definitely was not when if arrived, box had been opened and beat up really badly. Despite that, the player was still in good shape, appearance wise bit was broken.  So this is more of a review of the darker than the product, don't bother with them.  Ion support has been great and are taking care of everything.  They have been fantastic and good to deal with in the stressful situation. I'll update when the fixed product returns from Ion, however avoid Whisnant Electronics

B000OT8GCQ|3.0|First of all, I love Nicholas Sparks books! I have all of them. For this book I actually saw the movie first and then read the book. I have to say if you haven't seen the movie, read the book first because for me the book was not good compared to the movie. Too many details were different. But overall I would recommend this book, just don't watch the movie til later.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|This is a great series with a wonderful message, well-acted and enjoyable with just the right amount of suspense, danger, humor, and compassion.
B0027MJU00|2.0|This book was too long and the ending was terrible. The book could have been told in half the amount of pages.

0151003084|5.0|If this little book had been bigger, only then would it have been more perfect. The perverse ways, from A to Z, that children meet their untimely demise (I imagine) is not for those who like saccharine with their fairy tales. I especially loved the illustrations.

B00004X10B|5.0|I had a Tamrac Pro 8 but I quickly outgrew it and wanted to upgrade.  I generally carry two DSLRs, an assortment of lenses and filters, a flash unit, and a host of cleaning supplies and various other gadgets.  Based upon other reviews, I felt that carrying anything larger than the Pro 12 would increase the risk of bag checking requirements with the airlines, so I chose this bag.  It's expensive for a bag, but if you've ever owned a Tamrac photo bag, you can easily see the quality, strength and durability for which you are paying.  There are plenty of pockets and compartments in this bag to store most everything for a professional photographer (which I am not).  IMO, If you need a larger photographer's bag than this, you will likely be too weighted down, are probably carrying too much gear, and likely need to practice more discretion in what you carry.  Anyway, the one drawback is that the bag does not include a rain cover.  It's not enough to knock it down a star but I would expect that to be included at this price.  However, you may do as I do and carry a trash bag or two in one of the many pockets to protect the bag and your gear from a sudden downpour. All in all, I am very pleased with this bag and highly recommend.

B002HWRYJE|4.0|An excellent job of picking actors who look like (and usually sound like) young versions of Kirk, Spock, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, Bones, and Scotty - Spock, Sulu and Chekov especially.  Well, Uhura too; I couldn't imagine better.  Oh, heck - all of 'em!  The script was not quite up to what I expected, but I think the next one ('Star Trek - Into Darkness') will be better.  If you are a Star Trek TOS fan at all, get it - especially at the price.

193700788X|5.0|For the people who didn't like this book I wonder if they had ever read any of the books in the series before? Because if you have read this series you would have to be a total idiot to not know where Charlaine Harris was going with Sookie!<br />  Sookie had always wanted kids so why would it have not ended up this way? The story & the writing was great as always. Just because some people didn't like who Sookie ends up with they are going to trash this book? That's just crazy.<br /> Charlaine Harris tied off all the ends off just as they should be.<br /> She did a great job with the whole series & should be proud she did right by Sookie's character by giving her the ending she truly deserved.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I must admit that I never thought I would watch a film based on a comic book; and then I realized, I had seen all the Chris Reeve films of Superman - a hypocrite of sorts was I.<br /><br />I admired this from the very beginning.  Brannagh is of course a very talented man;  he and his casting director chose the actors very well.  One gets the sense that Loki is not \\"a good guy\\" right from the beginning - and also it's pertinent to note I had not read any \\"Viking lore\\" since I was a young girl ... found in a child's book of legends, then searched for later in myths and mythologies.<br /><br />All in all this was beautifully presented, well acted, fun and entertaining.  I surprised myself!<br /><br />I would love to see \\"the Gatekeeper\\" in other films; his was a weighty responsibility.<br /><br />Sorry I'm not better at writing reviews, but I have not been moved to do so very often

B00A8MGIZG|4.0|Cloud Atlas (2012, rated R) is a very compelling action-drama about our common humanity and how our words and actions have lasting effects. Its six intertwined stories span the period between 1849 and 2321, with Tom Hanks and others playing multiple parts: the son-in-law of a plantation owner in 1849, a gay composer in 1936, an African-American woman reporter in 1973, a 65-year-old publisher in 2012, an enslaved clone in 2144, and three societies in 2321. Highlights for me were Hugo Weaving as the English female Nurse Noakes facing a pub full of Scots; and the Neo Seoul action scenes. Every actor is stellar in this movie. Some viewers have complained about the quirky dialect of the far-future society, but I think it fits. The quick introduction to six stories was jarring for a minute or so, but after that I liked how they were woven together by theme (slavery or conformism) or event (a book, symphony, or assassination), instead of sitting through each story individually. There is language, sex, and blood in appropriate measure for the storyline. The ending for the far-future people was excellent. I watched Cloud Atlas (2012) with my parents and university-age sister. No one asked for an intermission and we had a very spirited discussion afterward.
0767827716|5.0|Great Movie.<br />Awesome car that is supernaturally possessed.  Christine is a very jealous ride, not to be betrayed.<br />This movie is a classic and all car/horror lovers should get it.<br />I highly recommend it.

B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I would watch this a million more times and have decided I will end up buying it one of these days
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Wish I did'nt have to wait for the rest of the story, but I am sure it will be worth it...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app great for getting the weather on my kindle instantly for my area.  Also when we travel just punch in the zip and bam its there.  Highly recommend it.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|The latest version, as of 05/27/13, will connect from my GS4 to my second generation, Sony GoogleTV player, but it won't display video (sound works); I tried streaming directly to my Samsung smart led tv, but I couldn't get sound, only video. I was trying to steam movies from the apps free movie section. I have it 3 stars because it will stream personal videos taken from my personal media library.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never been big on sitting in front of computer to play solitare.  Bought to entertain myself on a trip on my kindle.  I know play while watching TV and in the car when traveling on long trips.  Its easy and I have improved my game a lot.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I JUST bought the full version game just to be stuck on the very next section! So pissed! The last Crayon is behind the `back` menu so u can't advance further. Wat to rip people off. Don't get this game.
B009R659L8|4.0|This book held my interest and was hard to put down.  Bought to take on vacation and ended up reading the entire book before I left. Had to buy another.  Which means it is a great book. Highly recommend
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|There have been some complaints that this movie is just a stitch up of the cut-scenes from the Lego Batman Video game.  I can't say whether this is true or not, but I can say that this is a great stand alone film for kids.  I don't think it was rated, but a PG rating seems appropriate.  Lots of \\"lego\\" violence.  In any case, we're big fans of Clutch Powers, and this one was better all around.  Where the \\"Clutch\\" story fell apart (no pun intended) this one stayed together to the end.  It's clever, funny and the production was terrific.  Well worth the rent.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a lot of fun for all ages people will love this app<br />The graphic are great so clear
B008602KQI|4.0|We had already seen this film on Netflix. You're film had good picture quality and sound. The film itself could have been better. Not what I was expecting.

B00B19GKI0|2.0|I've always liked Escape from NY but whatever you did to the sound was horrible and the picture quality wasn't good. The original was much better. Keep trying.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|Some songs, like Entertainment are immediately fantastic.  I love Wolfgang... and figured this album would be similar.  Some tracks are, but others disappointed at first.  Multiple listens later, and I grew to really appreciate all songs on this album.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game... loves the obstacles. course taking care of the horses. its so real life like its awesome. she plays it every day
B00APUTEBG|4.0|The plot is very persuasive: a traitor CIA agent that steals Israeli secrets, sells them to the Russians and blames an innocent co-worker. This can have happened dozens of times. It is how things really are in this world. The actors are not very good, but the power of the story prevails.
0547884591|5.0|This is a brilliant book I would highly recommend it to anybody. It isn't too much about cooking, its more about how the principles apply to every day life & how to be awesome at stuff. Very interesting, kinda scattered, but amazing, nonetheless.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|All is very well done, and the boy that plays Lucas is awesome. But is it possible, is it reasonable to suppose that in such terrible circumstances nobody prays, nobody even says \\"Jesus\\"? This is really IMPOSSIBLE. The description of physical suffering is accurate, but from the spiritual standpoint it lacks depth. In this sense it is not properly a realistic account, but a reductive interpretation of the facts. Most of Hollywood guys live in a separate universe. They will never understand common people like you and me -- or the victims of a tsunami.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it is a very fun game to play and I am happy that it is a dollar not 4 dollars
0790729393|5.0|This drama was engaging from the get-go.  The star-studded cast was magnificent in this incredible story...leaves you wondering if this could have really happened.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. each game gets more and more difficult as you level up. and this way I'm not playing the same game over and over all the time. I would definitely recommend this game
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|There are so many tidbits in this book to think about, remember, share, and come back and look at again, think about again ...
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I loved the story but the ending was a disappointment, as if the author simply ran out of steam and did not feel like unwinding the plot.
159463176X|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book and really wanted to like it.<br /><br />The beginning of the story pulled me in and tugged at my heart... detailing the separation of two siblings after their mother dies.<br /><br />In each of his three novels, Hosseini does an amazing job of providing a glimpse into the world of Afghanistan... both the wealthy and the poor. My absolute favorite part of his writing is about Afghan culture.<br /><br />This is a novel that spans over 60 years in time. Really, there were at least six separate sets of story and character which are woven together through the course of the novel. I felt like once I had really started to get to know a part of the story, he moved on to the next.<br /><br />I did not feel that there were extremely strong ties between the different stories. He did bring them together, but not in a way I found meaningful or inspiring. I felt like I kept reading and waiting for the message... which I never got.<br /><br />Hosseini is a gifted writer who has intrigued me with his stories of Afghanistan, making it more than just a place of war. Unfortunately, this book was disappointing.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I wasn't expecting such an immersive and visually stunning game when I downloaded it. It was worth it and I hope to play it out to the end!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I will be waiting for season 5 to show up here on amazon instant videos for prime members and then later season 6.
1892005034|4.0|Marshall helped me grow in awareness of Empathy and Compassion through his simple, 4 step process of emotional honesty and curiosity about what people are feeling and needing.  This book, in an easily readable format, clearly presents a formula to connect with others in an effective way.<br /><br />If there is a criticism about NVC, it is that people misunderstand the word Nonviolence.  You don't have to scream and yell to have a violent communication.  Saying &#34;No&#34; to someone is violent in Marshall's world view because you are not sharing what is going on inside of you, i.e. what you are feeling and needing.  Responses like &#34;No&#34; end communication, rather than enhance communication and hence connection with the other person.
B00CW665VI|5.0|A totally and unexpected story!  I read it in one day.  I love characters that you can love, hated and laugh along with.  Can't wait for the next one!  Great read
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Buyer Beware! If you purchase a used copy of this DVD, chances are it will have missing chapters. It will either freeze up or skip. The problem is that MGM originally released a defective product. When this was discovered, they offered their customers a free replacement. Now, less than scrupulous people are capitalizing on the situation by selling off the defective ones. You may find yourself a victim of just such a seller if you purchase a used one. I purchased mine from GoHastings who advertised it as being in &#34;Very Good&#34; condition. Actually, Amazon states that a DVD that is missing segments is &#34;Unacceptable,&#34; so a rating of &#34;Very Good&#34; is an outright lie. Because the new one is so expensive, I offered to keep the DVD &#34;as is&#34; if they would discount the price. Apparently, they thought an &#34;Unacceptable&#34; DVD was worth the full price and would not discount it. So, beware and make sure you are not purchasing one of the defective DVDs--contact the seller and get some guarantees or see if they are willing to check it for the missing chapters.
B002VE5472|5.0|The awesome thing about this movie (that I see many overlooking) is the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously. So many people are blindingly focussed on the big plot twist that they're missing all the fun. The movie is actually jesting about the very story tactics it is using. Notice when Nico mentions 'red herrings' and incorrectly calls them red snappers, when he later mentions \\"Well, that would make one hell of an act two twist\\", and when they pass a hiker that says, \\"Careful, there's alot of twists and turns ahead.\\" It's ironic humor that's subtle and smart, and let's you know the movie is not too uptight to poke fun at itself. Who cares if you know who did it, enjoy the ride!! The acting is superb, the actors effortlessly believable and likable, and the scenery is breathtaking. This movie is much more than just a pin-holed who-done-it, it is a fun as hell trip!!
B008E6I1K8|5.0|It is a great book reference, the language its simple and easy to follow. I recommend it to all c# community
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|As an adopted Irish-American girl born in the 1960`s to an unwed Irish girl visiting New York, I felt a pull into this book that just kept getting stronger.  The unfair and unimaginable abuses to the innocent abandoned children felt like raw cuts that never quite heal.  Author, Christina McKenna, has such a gift with the  character's deep and fragile inner self talk that we all have.  How easily could I or my unwed biological mother been in this bittersweet emotionally scaring novel?
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Intriguing Drama<br /><br />Court Cases Very Real<br /><br />Political Dynamics very Realistic<br /><br />I can't say enough about this show...<br /><br />I wish I started watching it sooner
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I VIEW TECHNOLOGY WITH A JAUNDICED EYE. ON THE ONE HAND, WHAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE TOUCH OF A FINGER IS AMAZING. THIS APP PROVIDES JUST WHAT I NEED WHEN I NEED IT.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Kindle has opened my reading experience. No more trips to the library.  My discovery of authors such as this is as good as it gets. I read until my eyes were red and the kindle fell off my lap. What more could I say?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I highly encourage others to check it out.
1250000971|5.0|It's Jeffrey Archer- need I say any more? Good book. Good follow up and I enjoyed reading very much -
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I really like listening to this album because of it's previously unreleased nature. It's obvious that not all of the songs were really &#34;release-ready&#34;, but that also makes it more interesting if you're a fan of Jimi. For example the first two songs sound completely different, but have the same lyrics. I guess he was trying to see which one sounded best.  If you like Hendrix, you should get this album.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Game was great but going towards level 12  and afterward.  The game would stop completely and kindle would not shut down.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Subtle ,colourful storytelling.  Le carre tackles the new phenomenon of the &#34;privatisation&#34; of war.  It's hard to put down and his use of the English Language is as ever scintillating
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! Hard to put down until the very end! Author does a great job at keeping your interest the entire time.
B003VANOFY|3.0|Decent battery life, pretty tough construction, decent mic.  Everything about it is decent.  I would have given it 4 stars, but it has two shortcomings.<br /><br />First it pops and hisses in my ear anytime it is plugged into the usb station for charging.<br /><br />Second, the mic is always audible.  Even if you shut the mic off, its still audible.  Very very annoying if you have sharp hearing.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|every time we go to play with it we have a problem getting started. it will turn on and when you get ready to play it goes back to the menu. this is very frustrating. it would be a good game if the app would work
B00CW665VI|5.0|I found this book very entraining.  The storyline was fast paced but I found that I liked the story.  I liked that the book was in Drew's point of view and that the story starts in the middle, and then we get the backstory! I loved Kate and the banter between the characters and found the friendships and interactions between the characters quite charming.  I read the book in a day, and loved it!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|At times I found myself skimming quickly through paragraphs, if not pages, at a time because this novel belabors some details unnecessarily.  That being said, its still got all of the great cynicism, wit, and blue collar philosophy that I've loved in all of Abercrombie's stories.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Only downfall with this game is that it is very addictive.  The graphics are cute animations.  It is a lot of fun to play.  Great for kids too because there are no blood and guts, just cute characters.  I recommend this game for all ages.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|...Wow. Everything about this show is great. The art direction, the writing, the actors, the cinematography are all top notch, especially the make-up for the zombies!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I mistakenly deleted my older (from December 2012) weather app a few days ago and 're-downloaded what I thought was the same thing from the cloud. I am very impressed with the new look and feel and ease of use of this improved version, and heartily recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use, complete app. I also could not enter more than 3 locations in the previous version, but so far I have entered 4 in the new version with no trouble. This is important to me because it allows a look at what kind of weather relatives and friends<br /> are experiencing, as well as a quick look at expected weather in the path of road trips.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Our book club read the book and it was the first time in all the years of book club that everyone loved the book!  Hands down a well developed, interesting, cannot put it down read!

B0000640SB|5.0|One of the best and most original films to come out of Hollywood in the last 20 years. Director Barry Sonnenfeld takes his unashamedly different approaches to film and comedy into the area of the \\"comic book movie franchise\\" genre. The wonderful cast is headed up by the always dependable Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as Agents K and J, respectively. It is an absolutely delightful film, in every sense of the word. The movie combines drama with humor and action, and does it very well. It is the best film I've seen in the area of achieving these moments of fierce action and real-world occurrences, directly followed up by moments of off-the-wall sci-fi adventure and outrageous dialogue/characterizations/body language. 'Men in Black' is more or less three parallel stories running simultaneously, all expertly navigated by Sonnenfeld. We have the background story of the Men in Black agency, being told to us by Agent K and Director Zed (Rip Torn). In a nutshell, the agency has been around for a long time. They monitor alien activity, and protect Earth's citizens from any possible harm they might want to inflict. Smith first shows up as NYPD cop James Edwards, who through a very strange (yet hilarious) set of occurrences, is gradually inducted into the agency and learns the ropes, therefore becoming the newest recruit. And we have the not-so-unfortunate story of a douchebag farmer named Edgar, who is killed but his skin is used as a disguise 'Edgar suit' for an evil alien bug. This bug plans to find an item of great importance to him and to other alien races, so that a certain war between two of these races can continue, and his own race can continue to feed off the casualties - literally. Now, while this may seem like a lot of unnecessary explanation leading to a lot of unnecessary exposition in the film, this is simply not so. The story is explained, very quickly, in just a few scenes. Sometimes, we figure out things as the characters do, other times, we are let in on stuff long before the characters ever are. But the film does not ever lose pace because of these elements, nor does it stop so the audience can catch up with all these goings-on. The film purposefully barrels along at a breakneck speed, and the audience is just expected to dive right in and hold on for dear life. Once this is accomplished, the story is really not that hard to understand. However, if one feels that the story disappoints or just doesn't understand it, then  the film is always entertaining just as a great popcorn flick. This would also probably be the case for why small children enjoy these films so much - they may not understand the story particulars, but they like the special effects and the comedic moments. This is all assisted by not only the exceptional main cast, but also by several great character actors and actresses, such as Tony Shalhoub and Siobhan Fallon. Whichever way you look at it, 'Men in Black' is a ridiculously entertaining ride of action and all kinds of comedy, and I highly recommend it. Which is not something I can say for 'Men in Black II', unfortunately. Since I haven't seen 'Men in Black III' as of yet, I cannot comment on it in the slightest. I'm hoping it's just as good, or better even, than this first installment.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|very easy to put some I changed it of place so that they were turning out to be better and they did not lose glue... I it recommend very nice colors equally to as they appear in the image.. I also buy the castle they look great together..
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|a cute game,  although slow in development and action.<br />a few more sand dollar generating plants would be good to include at lower costs.

B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I'am very satified with this movie it's full of action.And if action is what you are looking for then this is the movie for you.I was very suprised buy how great mark wahlberg sight is. This is not the movie for some one thats not looking for to much action.As all ways wahlberg has don it again.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw free is a good app but I wish the drawings were filtered or something before  you send them in because some people just write the answer and don't even bother to draw a picture. You have to play those annoying people or resign which makes you look bad.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|My son ordered this and he absolutely loves it.  It works as described and was very easy to hook up.  Thank you
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Love the way Sasha breaks down the sensitivity barriers & shows how we've become ridiculously PC sometimes In this world that it starts to get in the way of us truly coming together as a human race. At the same time, it definitely can get over the top too & arms like it starts getting crude just to be crude. Fun movie but it doesn't capture the magic of Borat. Fun rental though.

B00571F26Y|3.0|I appreciate the ideas about wheat and modifying the genetics of wheat and what that might do to us.  I appreciate the idea of stopping wheat, and will do so (today is day two).  But I think the book went off track when the author tells me to limit beans and even stop chia seed, as well as other recommendations that reek of Atkins.  If you don't want to bother with this book, then go on Atkins.  I cannot follow the strict, limiting diet Dr. proposes, so I'll just do what I saw on Dr. Oz - cut out wheat.  That was what was presented on that show.  I felt robbed reading the book and seeing what was REALLY required to get healthy.  But well written, funny in places, yes.  Also repetitive.  The science is backed up.  I suppose if I wasn't so disappointed that it's not just wheat I have to worry about, I might be happier with the book.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|I followed them from when they auditioned as single singers and got the chance to become a group... Personally, I think they are great... and I am over 70 yr old, a male that just likes GOOD, CLEAN MUSIC..and they have really have an extremely strong harmony between them, musically speaking... but they also show how the young should be on stage... fun, colorful and happy...
B004VFYPTW|2.0|Reading all these 4 and 5 star reviews makes me wonder if they're all listening to the same show I am? Musically the band are fine, with two extremely talented guitarists out front (Adrian Vandenberg and Steve Vai) and a monster rhythm section behind them (Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge). However,Coverdale's voice was SHOT at this point in the Slip of the Tongue tour. I can't believe no one here mentions the fact he sounds awful throughout this show. He almost sounds OK singing the mellow parts of Judgement Day and Is This Love, but any song that makes him push his voice at all reveals how weak it is. I'm not talking about a missed note here and there, or an occasional crack in it. I'm talking about a croaking delivery, the inability to hit ANY notes and a hoarse, almost laryngitis-like condition. I doubt that I'll ever watch or listen to this one again, it's THAT awful.<br />Visually the band looks great, in all that late 80's/early 90's leather and big hair. Sure, the video if fuzzy and at times the stage is dark, but it's an outside show at a festival. It's always hard to light everything successfully under those conditions.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse to replace an old Razor DeathAdder and I highly suggest this mouse. It fits well in my right hand and the buttons feel just right. My only complaint is that the cover over the additional weight area is really hard to get off. Fortunately that is a one time thing in most cases.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Too many unanswered questions on this film. I'm forced to post this after many months of thought and add mine to the sea of over 3,200 reviews. (3,246 as of posting). This film will, like Blade Runner, likely have several different releases and edits to shore this up over the passage of time. Hopefully Ridley takes care of this sooner rather than later. He's approaching the same problems that Weyland faced.<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />I've finally rewatched Prometheus one more time last night, after a long period of letting it digest. I think I might've seen it now 5 times total. I'm stunned to say that after all these months, no hype, no expectation, nada ... honestly ... that film had A LOT of problems.<br /><br />It was still good, but it was a definite let down. Better writing than Tron:Legacy? No. Not even close. The visuals were very good. But too many plot holes - and a whole sea of different plot holes than the ones people were bitching about before elsewhere on the internet.<br /><br />1. Why was Peter Weyland represented as an old man, since he was a master of robotics and making robots that look like humans? Cosmetic surgery didn't seem like it would be that difficult. He should've been represented as a young man, but still dying. Even in 2013, life expectancy is about to shoot up to around 200-300 years in the next 50 (for those who can afford it), so why do we see the ruler of the Universe incapable of basic surgery? Makes no sense. I get that people might have been confused about the difference of aging and physical appearance, but it would've fit to see this addressed appropriately. Just Google: Aubrey de Gray.<br /><br />2. Why did Ms. Vickers even go along on the flight? She could've stayed home and run the company from Earth (her main priority) if she believed that he was going out there to die, which she had stated. Her very presence after that dialogue killed her character. Did the real Ms. Vickers send a Replicant in her stead? This will likely open the next film if so.<br /><br />3. After waking from hypersleep, Shaw became shocked to discover what the real mission was and that the mission had a corporate interest that superseded the scientific. This reaction and plot twist was incredibly unbelievable and poorly thought out. One would be trained, debriefed and know full well what was going on, and expected, long before that ship would've ever leave Earth orbit. Recall Aliens 2, when everyone awakes. Everyone was clear on the mission.<br /><br />4. Millburn (with Fifield abandoned during storm) thought that a snake looking animal on a foreign planet, where everyone mysteriously died, that rises up into an attack posture, like a cobra, is non-threatening and a 'good girl'? That whole scene should've been removed / reshot / never shown. That is seriously bad writing. C'mon, ya'll. This scene has universally been derided the most and found to be the weakest of ideas.<br /><br />5. What was with the weird sexual energy between Ms. Vickers and Peter Weyland, her father? It was never explained, never looked at beyond the one scene in his bedroom, although definitely underlined. For what reason? The scene between Weyland / Vickers and then the later scene with Capt. Janek (Idris Elba) and Vickers, where he questions her about being a robot - leaves me to believe that Ms. Vickers, too, was a Replicant, and probably not dead -- yet. Here, we once more approach the \\"I want more life, Father!\\" Nexus 10?<br /><br />6. The theatrical version's end fight scene between Shaw and the Spacejockey was  way too convenient and over too quick. You could blink and miss it. The extended scenes fight version was the scene they should've shown. Editing down for time is always a bad idea and one would think that Ridley Scott would learn his lesson. I don't think he can blame anyone else other than himself on this one.<br /><br />7. The Prometheus had *absolutely no means of defense*? Really? Ramming the other ship was the *only* option? That's bad writing. Ship travels through hostile space to a distant location and not even a single missile? That didn't seem to fit the story line at all. Other ships in previous films look like mining vessels. Okay. Got it. But the Prometheus looked like a serious piece of hardware. No defenses? Fail.<br /><br />8. Strangely, the centerpiece scene of the film, from what I saw, with the most energy and action, was the self-abortion / self-surgery scene with Shaw and the Alien fetus. Odd that a scene like that would be the center-piece in the editing. Odd that a meaningless scene that was fully spectacle become the biggest scene in a film that was  ... 100% spectacle. Well, haha ... maybe not ...<br /><br />9. Having the waking Spacejockey kill Peter Weyland and rip David's head off for no apparent reason without any kind of hesitation or even having the Spacejockey ask how long he was in Hypersleep for, (like a Han Solo shooting at Darth Vader without even hesitating), was probably the worst writing of the film. Yes, it's a top secret Military Installation and he had to kill anyone on sight immediately, but after having been asleep for a few thousand years ... one would wake to ask questions ... no matter who you were. That's honestly poor character development. If you did that in a novel, people would accuse you of 'avoiding conflict / resolution' which is pivotal for any story. Thus, I'm accusing them of avoiding conflict in order to wrap things up too quick.<br /><br />10. I wasn't bothered by the falling ship scene as typically, when someone throws something at you, and you run away to avoid it, there's often a scenario where you end up running directly into the downward arc of it. However, that being said, the real problem of that scene was the physics of forward momentum, or lack there of. After those ships took off, they would inevitably crash down farther away in the direction of travel and not fall back to earth -- in reverse. Yes -- that was definitely odd. I need to see that one in a simulator before I would've said: \\"Yeah, let's do that in the final minutes of the film.\\"<br /><br />And then there's this ... possibly the whole point of this thing ...<br /><br />11. Perhaps this film is actually, in some strange, tangential way, about abortion. Not the morality of it, which is what we humans seem to get wrapped up in, but the reality of it. Like the line from Fight Club, delivered by Tyler Durden:<br /><br />\\"Listen to me! You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen.\\"<br /><br />Humans now become D-Listed as an awkward, embarrassing accident. Which opens the obvious reality that -- we, the humans -- are a greater threat somewhere down the line genetically, than all these monsters we've set out to find or discover, perhaps including even our own engineers. Consider the following:<br /><br />A) Dude offs himself in a primordial stream and up we pop like a goddamned freak show.<br /><br />B) The Engineers panic and set in motion a desire that they need to kill these bashtards (us) off somehow, before it's too late. Like they knew we were too-violent based upon the missing strands of DNA that we lacked from our forefathers.<br /><br />C) Make goo -- make a boatload of it, enough to possibly wipe out two worlds -- ship it off to Earth -- wipe them out, because these acid blood, body humping, multi-strain life-forms are less dangerous than those freaky Earthlings are. Wow. Now -- that's something to consider. Those humans are destined to destroy everyone and everything, they're tribal and pretty stupid to boot. Eff those effers. Send in the bugs. Send them now!<br /><br />I give 3 stars, because while it was beautiful and somewhat entertaining. The writing is incredibly questionable. It doesn't deliver what it could have, or even leads us to believe.<br /><br />...* option? That's bad writing. Ship travels through hostile space to a distant location and not even a single missile?

B000G03RJA|5.0|I LOVE!! Laura Branigan and her music. It was sad to here about her death, but her music continues. Thanks for having her Platinum Collection I'm very happy.
B0097K21YW|3.0|This is the first &#34;shooter&#34; type game I've tried so for me it got too frustrating after chapter 1/level 30 and I can't make it past level five on the other chapters. Maybe I just haven't accomplished enough to earn the power needed for higher levels but I'm finding it repetitive.  Kinda fun for a little while but other reviewers have already stated same issues I found.  No info about what the scores mean (none that I have seen at least.) On Kindle Fire 7-inch need to zoom all the way out to see entire game field which makes the images quite small, diminishing the fun, and the kindle home tab covers the game's right scroll (eventually can get to the right scroll, but it's tedious.)
B001UGB1X8|4.0|The accents were solid, the acting was really good, the plot was really good with a lot of &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34;. Thing is when the movie was over - even thought it was all that, it really wasn't. It was sort of long and dragging in places. A really good movie makes you want to see it over and over again, I liked this movie but I don't really want to see it again. So worth a look, yes but worth a second look, for me, no.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very fun enjoyable for everyone and every age. Wish I had this sooner so I could reap the benefits of this awesome game!!!
B006S08RLU|4.0|Amelie (English Subtitled) - quirky movie about a girl who goes around helping others and then falls in love herself. Good acting and really cute movie - did seem a bit long though. It was worth the 99 cents I paid to watch it.
B000VUM23M|3.0|The movie is well written, but there was a defect in the disc, it would freeze at the same spot. My DVD & Blu-ray player are fine with every other disc. Software is up to date. I find a small scratch on the disc. I handle my discs with care, I own over one thousand discs, it was defective the from the first play, tried it again, froze the same spot. It wasn't worth dealing with sending it back because it was only $7.13. It seemed like it may have been repackaged as the UPC code was on the outside of the shrink wrap.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Jake reminds me of a yong Bob Dylan. I do not mean that he is a carbon copy but his insight is very Dylanesque.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I coudn't wait to read this last book in the series. It was not a disappointment. I couldn't put it down and was glad to have closure with Catniss and her life struggles.
B009T8XBBO|1.0|Fun game but definitely not worth the money. All you really no is tap on a object and do nothing until the guy finishes fixing that part of the  road. Their is to much waiting. You have to remember what the power ups on the bottom of the screen mean.  Once you get to the last few levels it is super hard to get passed it. Their are to many things to fix, and not enough time. Once the Dragon comes at nightfall you end up having to do the level over again, and it takes a while to complete the levels once you get going. This game just waists your time that you could spend doing something actually fun and not stupid. The first level is so easy a baby could do it. All you had to do was stitch like one pile of sticks, and you where done. Don't waist your money on a piece of junk. I even regret getting it for the free app of the day. I wish I could give it zero stars but I can't. Just don't get it. A waist of time and money.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|This album is for anyone who loves great creative improvisation and live music.  Tedeschi and Trucks have a great chemistry.  Go figure, they are married to each other.  I agree fully with other reviewers who compare the spirit of this album to great live works, such as Allman Brothers \\"Fillmore East\\" and Dereck and the Dominos \\"Live At the Fillmore.\\"  I suppose the extended jams are not to everbody's taste, but, as far as I'm concerned, there is never a point on this recording where they sound too spacey (Greatful Dead) or wandering all over the place.  The jamming is one of the most excellent examples I've ever heard of creatively improvising with the studio tracks and other songs which are covered here.  The full harmonized backing vocals stood out to me also.  There is a beautiful spirited feel to the music, and all musicians are in top form.  This is wonderful soulful blues rock at it's best.  Yes, there are some extended intro's, but I love hearing great improv.  If you don't especially like live improv, then I would suggest that you stick to their studio albums, but if you are a musical adventurer, who can't get enough tasteful live improv, then this is one to add to your collection if you haven't already done so.
B005T87QCI|5.0|So many iap ( in app) purchases, just make it 8 dollars. Solid game, but my custom robot cant use special/ripoff moves!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I remember while most teenagers in the mid to late 90's were listening to pop, rap, country, or crappy alternative stuff that was apssing for rock, I was listening to bands teens 10 and 20 years prior were listening to, Scorpions, Motley Crue, Led Zeppelin, Rush, ACDC to name just a few, but all bands you know and many you could probably guess.  Rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot.  My picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical Rush fans, but regardless of album I could at least find enjoyment in half the album, if not the whole thing.  This caused some troubles with some of the 70's stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs, but hey.  2112 is an amazing album.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album just didn't grab me.  For starters the production was a little too muddy, though I could overlook that with better songs.  And that's where this album really falls flat.  The song writing is just ok at best.  There's nothing to capture one's attention with most of them.  They aren't really bad or anything, they're just there.  You have Caravan which started the album off to a decent note, but that being the first single, had I known, would have worried me as it's only a decent song. Halo Effect is by far my favorite song on here.  I love the acoustic guitars, and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort, beautiful song.  Garden had nice acoustic guitars as well, but I think I was hoping for more reading how much others like this song.  It's still decent though.<br /><br />The album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how they'd work together.  One song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all, but really doesn't fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere, though probably the best part of that song.  The vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring.  The guitar riffs, mostly are the same, though there are a few stand out riffs to be found.  Headlong Flight has a great riff and awesome verses, setting up to be a great fast paced rocker, however the chorus which isn't that great completely changes the pace, and not in a way that works.  The song gets ridiculously slow.  I get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this, but this particular song it didn't work.  Bu2b or whatever had the same problem.  The verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast, in a way that didn't work for me.<br /><br />The main problem is this album is forgettable.  I've had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs, and even now I can only remember parts of some of them.  I shouldn't have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me.  There should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there weren't, just a couple that later grew on me.  It seems when Rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs, not counting instrumentals, they lose focus.  If there's another album in them I really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits.  These guys are better than this.<br /><br />Overall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for.  If you're a Rush fanatic you'll enjoy it.  If you like Rush, but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first, and if you like it then buy it.

0385349831|2.0|\\"Manuscript Found in Accra\\" is a record of advice given to the gathered community of Jerusalem by a \\"Copt\\" in July of 1099.  On the eve before French forces were expected to sack the city, the \\"soul of Jerusalem\\" was shared for posterity.  Jerusalem, at this time, was reputedly a community of peace where Jew, Christian, and Muslim lived together in harmony(?!).  The manuscript itself is structured as a question and answer session.<br /><br />What otherwise could have been a non-fictional self-help book or work of religion or spirituality is cloaked as a novel via this framework.  While the idea is interesting, making the reading experience more intriguing than if it were simply presented as the contemporary author's ideas, its execution wasn't entirely convincing.  Although the prose is reminiscent of antiquated wisdom literature, the resemblance is passing.  Its authenticity is dubious and, consequently, the reader is never really transported to 11th century Jerusalem.<br /><br />A fair amount of the advice, if not groundbreaking, is certainly well-intentioned and may inspire some readers to greater depth and fulfillment in their lives.  Unfortunately, most of the \\"wisdom\\" is so basic that those interested in this type of literature and, consequently, likely to read it probably won't be particularly enlightened or edified.  Some of the truths presented are self-evident but the author's analogies and examples offer little support (and, in some instances, are inexcusable logical fallacies).  That was probably the most disappointing aspect of the novel - it falters under intellectual scrutiny.<br /><br />The Q&A format could be comically contrived.  The answers were clearly the author's starting point; the set-up questions awkward afterthoughts to achieve an end.  For example, the transition to sex was absurdly abrupt.  A trader's wife follows up an old man's question about recovering lost moments with, \\"Speak to us about sex\\" (page 91).  I can imagine the stares of disapproval and shock she must have received!  In another instance, the answer doesn't suit the question given the circumstances.  A seamstress laments choosing to remain in the city for fear of change (page 45).  The Copt's (predictable) response, in which he exhorted them to embrace change, was useless to his audience.  While it might have been helpful and appropriate days before the siege, at present it's simply salt in the wound.  Why not speak to her current situation?  Too often the moralizing came across as trite and condescending platitudes.<br /><br />Some of the thought was also quite shallow.  Happiness is equated with rightness and religion is presented as a means to worship mystery rather than oppress and convert.  Even if the reader generally agrees, the presentation is just too simple to be taken seriously.  There's a recurring theme that the individual is to pursue his \\"dream\\", i.e. the desire of his soul, often at the expense of his relationship to others.  One may wonder whether Coelho is sharing spiritual wisdom or simply justifying his own life choices.<br /><br />While I appreciate Paulo Coelho's intent and effort, the flaws are too numerous to really recommend the work.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|This is one if my favorite films of all time, from when I was a kid. I have owned it on every format possible. The picture looks great on blu-ray and the story is still classic today! Get this movie and introduce a whole new generation to one of the great and fun eighties movies!

B00BI73CVI|2.0|It was spectacular filming and the idea that it was filmed live was great to know. But as  show, meh, I thought it moved very slowly.  Add on the depressing subject matter and you get bored after a while.
B005D0RDO8|2.0|I heard a lot about this movie and how it was ahead of its time.  Very wierd. Too sadisitic. Not sexy or erotic at all. Stay away.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It was a nice movie for a quiet evening at home.  A few laugh out loud chuckles, but other than that, just a feel good kind of movie.  I like Seth Rogen and Barbara Striesand, which helps the enjoyment.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|I first saw this movie in Boston in the 1980's.  It was great then and it is still great. Give the viewpoint and sufferings of German men at war; and the futility of war. The U-boat attack scenes and depth charge scenes are incredible and give you are there feeling. The blue ray transfer is excellent.

B00CRW2066|5.0|I have listened to this album four times through in the past three days and it has been a long time since and album has clicked for me like this one has. Mash up Joy Division and Leonard Cohen with 80's pop sensibilities of Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Murphy, etc. Demons is my favorite track but as I said just start the album and let it go where it may...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is so cool.I play it all the time the only bad thing is earning money cause the only level that gives you a lot of it is the moon level
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Short and Sweet<br /><br />If you want performance value for your AMD CPU, then GIGABYTE is far superior to ASUS.<br /><br />But do not attempt to carry over old CPUs and hard drives, they would be a waste of time for this board. Buy as new as you can afford and have a lot more fun with Windows 8.<br /><br />Linux installs are an adventure; not for the inexperienced user.<br /><br />After you get Windows 8 going, install every driver and update for this board before adding anything else. That includes the newest mobo BIOS revision (FC).
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This free game is fun.... cuz it`s free and... fun. Thank you. That is all. Five four three two one.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This is a great story.  The writing is excellent.  The characters well developed and I cared about them very much.  The plot, though based on Cinderella, is still original and exciting.  It is full of action and intrigue with high stakes.  There is tragedy and humor too.  It ends with an ending that clearly demands a sequel and I am darn glad there is one so I can enjoy this world some more.  Just excellent!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game simple but it is able to provide amusement for a good amount of time. Excellent game for kids
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really enjoyed Tangled.  Reading an erotic novel from the male perspective was fun.  Drew is handsome, charismatic, funny, sexy, successful and a bit self centered...ok a lot self centered.  Kate is beautiful, smart, determined, and doesn't take Drew's crap.  A perfect pair.  Drew's point of view is thought provoking and hilarious, at the same time.  I see Prince Charming in a whole new way now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can hardly believe it's over ... the third and final book. Finishing a good book is like saying goodbye to a friend :( This has been a good, although at times hard-to-read, series of books. Very well written with great, vivid characters. The subject matter is at times difficult to take, but the story drew me in and still kind of haunts me. I'm definitely curious to see how this book is depicted when it's brought to the big screen :)

193700788X|1.0|Ok, Ms. Harris, fess up. Admit you actually paid Laurel Hamilton to ghost-write this mess for you because you just couldn't bring yourself to end what _had_ been a pretty great series... well, at least I borrowed it from the library instead of getting stuck with paying for it :-(
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|BBC America's new proffering takes me back to my Lost fangirl days of reading way too much into every little fictional thing, but then coming out of the frenetic fan-research with some actual thoughtful content to mull over. It's profoundly written, acted and executed. For those coming off of the Lost or Fringe waves, this series will sweep you right back off your feet.<br /><br />Orphan Black's subject matter delves into the mysterious and exciting world of fringe science's cloning endeavor. Our protagonist, Sarah Manning, should not exist. But by whatever miracle of Sciences-That-Should-Not-Be, she does. But this isn't a story about one woman. This is a story about several whose resemblances begin and end at their faces. The clones of Orphan Black are separate and distinct characters amazingly brought to life in what could only be described as a Herculean acting feat accomplished by lead actress Tatiana Maslany. Alongside her charismatic foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris), and a host of supporting characters (several portrayed by Maslany) with their own tall tales and complex relationships, Sarah is suddenly made aware of the bizarre nature of her existence, and in lieu of a mixture of necessity and natural curiosity, begins to pull back the pages of her life. With each turn of the chapter --or in this case, packed episode -- the plot thickens. And watching it unfold is a most excellent way to spend your Saturday.<br /><br />I feel as though like the creators of Orphan Black have dipped generously from Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in crafting the premise of the show, and it's good if they have, being that Huxley's book is such mind-blowing and spooky material. There are easter eggy references to the author, so chances are that they actually have! To me, it's books and shows like these that define what true science fiction is. Science fiction isn't just all robots and mind control. It asks often bizarre but often important questions about absolutely everything. It digs deep into the \\"maybe\\"'s of life, and procures the unusual, the fantastic, the surreal and unreal.<br /><br />With any luck, this series will last as long as Lost or Fringe did. It certainly deserves to.g. It digs deep into the \\"maybe\\"'s of life, and procures the unusual, the fantastic, the surreal and unreal.<br /><br />With any luck, this series will last as long as Lost or Fringe did. It certainly deserves to.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Great ending. I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to see the movie!! Thanks
B001QWBM62|5.0|I would never give this Zoom recorder less than 5 stars. I wish I could have had this thing when I started playing guitar when I was younger. The ease and sound quality of this gem are unbelievable. Records onto a memory card and can instantly transfer to computer as soon as you record something. Having XLR inputs is fantastic, too. If you buy one make sure you download the firmware upgrade which adds enhanced features to the recorder. I couldn't recommend this highly enough for musicians and filmmakers, also.
1440503257|4.0|She loved it and can't wait to make some of the recipes. I think it would be a great purchase if you were to have a HP themed party as well or for older kids who are into the book and would like to learn how to cook.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Very well done. I am a Castle fan and this was<br />a great story line. I would recommend it to<br />anyone for an easy read.
B004UID2LC|4.0|it is a vrius but I get all the songs I what then delete. so far it works on my kindle fire. NO UPDATE &hellip;SO HAPPY I FOUND AN APP cool but hard to think of the song after you look so long for an app
B002B790YC|3.0|I had read the short story that inspired this movie and really liked it. Then my husband told me they had turned it into a movie. I was more curious than anything to see how it would translate to a movie. It was a very odd movie, the story didn't feel nearly as odd as watching it. It had been over a year since I read the book, so I wasn't making immediate comparisons.<br /><br />It was good to watch once, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I enjoy playing this neon version the sound and colors are very impressive. The movement with the lines to connect with my finger is great. It's a fun game, it's very small not much MB only 3 MB. It's addictive cannot put it down, when I begin to play.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|I had higher hopes for this movie. By the end we had all gotten up and started doing other things. None of us even cared how it ended. It was slow, painfully slow and somehow didn't flow very well. It felt like a forced movie on the part of the actors. I wish I had that time back to watch something better. I won't go into plots or anything like that because other people may really enjoy it. I just know that all four of us hated it.<br /><br />My son, who can watch just about anything was the one who picked it and the started apologizing about 30 minutes into it, when we should have turned it off.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|This movie was way too dark to even know what was going on. If the people were not standing outside in the day light you could not see anything. Very disappointed as this seemed like it would have been a good movie.
B009X01D9U|4.0|I really like this case, the price was good, it looks good, works good and seems well made and would have given it 5 stars, EXCEPT it is very difficult to remove the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; after it has been installed, also the case is somewhat bulky.<br />I wanted to remove my KF HD 8.9&#34; to install it in my blue Amazon Leather case that I got when I purchased my KF HD 8.9&#34;. I like the slim profile of the Amazon Leather case, the only thing is it doesn't have the portrait/landscape features that work as nicely as the Marware Resolve case. I like the fact that it is easy to install and uninstall the KF HD 8.9&#34; from the Amazon Leather case. The KF HD 8.9&#34; installs in much the same way in the Marware Resolve case, so I would guess that it has a design flaw that makes it fit too tight. If you are going to install your KF HD 8.9&#34; in the Marware Resolve case and leave it there, then this should not be a problem for you. I like to have some different colored cases and so it matters to me.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Sad, funny and very touching. I love Frank McCourt's style of writing. I could read a lot of it with an accent.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I liked this book, but I didn't love it. I'm not sure I liked the way the story was told. First person was a little annoying. Many people say in the reviews that they thought it was funny but I didn't really get it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read this book faster than I've read any other book in years. I just couldn't put it down!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great dungeon crawler, but the potion recovery time slows you down unless you want to spend money.... excellent way for the creators to get money back on an otherwise free game, so I can live with that.  Recommend trying it out!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|This cd is packed full of fun! I have enjoyed every song and many of the songs are uplifting and encourage a person to move forward even when things are down and some of them are also about the power of friendship. Such a great cd, but I already knew that, I love the show!
193700788X|2.0|** This review does contain spoilers!**<br /><br />I decided to do this one as a mini review because, honestly, I don't want to waste much time on this book.  I have spent years on this series now and I feel really let down by how this ended!  I just going to bullet point my thoughts and then be done with it once and for all.<br /><br />  * I hated the switching POV's....why do this now?  Up to this point we have gotten the whole story from Sookie's POV.  The sections of \\"mysterious\\" 3rd person weren't fooling anyone, we all knew who the mystery men were.<br />  * Eric is literally in 3 scenes and his part is so insignificant she may as well have just left him out completely.  She did her best to make the readers hate him so that we wouldn't really care when she wrote him out of Sookie's life.<br />  * There was not a huge story in this book.  It's more just plot junk that wraps up the series and tells us what happened with all those long lost characters we wanted to forget about....like Arlene and Steve Newlin.<br />  * Quinn was back...I did like that!<br />  * I have always liked Sam....don't get me wrong.  That said, I do NOT like that Sookie ended up with him at the end.  It's a little too much like Sookie needed to be with someone and she hadn't hooked up with Sam yet so why not?!  I knew this was coming though, it was the only way for Charlaine Harris to end the series and not keep Sookie and Eric together.  It was clear from the way the last couple books went that she wasn't going to go that route.<br />  * Just when we thought it was the end we find out that Ms. Harris has decided to release yet another book After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse.  WHAT THE FRICK?!! I don't think I can do it...I am not giving her MORE money to tell me something that she SHOULD have put in an epilogue chapter!<br /><br />So....as you can see, I am NOT a fan of how this ended! I think it's a waste of money and a HUGE letdown for what was such a promising series.series.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Excellence inSoul, Real down to earth in their Presentation. Britney Howard is outstanding in her vocals,Bassist is very cool as well as the rest of the band...High Marks for all!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a great read! I think every man needs to read this book, because there's love for everybody even when you don't want to love. This book is for them. I just loved this story!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I had started this book about a year ago, but couldn't push myself through the drudgery of the first half of the book. When I picked it back up and read it all the way through, it was amazing. All of Lena's emotions in the beginning of the book are frustrating, but it builds the story up. Highly recommend.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|The download on most of these episodes did not work correctly.  Every other scene stopped and would not resume until manually corrected.  Obviously defective.  Any reparation for this?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Another great book. I'm just hoping there is more. E.L James you sure have written the best 3 books I have ever read in my life. But I really would like more to their story. Thank you
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Jackson did a terrific job! Having watched his LOTR trilogy a bazillion times, it is now good to finally get started on the prequel.<br />I was not at all bothered (like some) that he included some &#34;extra&#34; information about characters...the books are books and movies are movies, they are different and we can enjoy the differences (or at least I do!)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Emotional...fantastic...breathtaking...real...heart wrenching...depressing...romantic...I did not want it to end. It felt so true and real, I could feel both happiness and anguish. Wonderful.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Very good movie, best of Tom Selleck, I highly recommend this movie, suspense, action and drama of the best performances of Tom Selleck, thanks Amazon.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|You read about movies where people want their two hours back.  Then there is this movie where you want your two hours back and you want to erase it from your memory.  Do yourself a favor and just avoid this film.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|As others have said, this is not just another \\"match 3\\" game.  The early levels are fairly easy, but don't let that fool you.  As you progress it takes quite a bit of thought to figure out how to remove all the symbols.  There's no particular reason why I took off a star; I just save 5 star reviews for truly great apps and this one doesn't quite meet that criteria, but it is very good.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love this game.  I downloaded it because it was an app of the day and the insurance commercial on tv that has the pig playing it, but that is beside the point.  I am extremely horrible at this game in general, but it is still a great concept and is actually fun.  Great work guys
B00CW665VI|2.0|The writing was fine but too much narration, got kind of annoying. And, although there weren't many, I'm all set hearing every detail of sex scenes..  I did finish it but wouldn't recommend it as a good read
B00A80SHFM|2.0|Don't get me wrong because the music is very good.  The reason I didn't like it is because when you play it on car stereo the labels don't show up so you can never see where you're at.  One of our cars has a music player storage area that you copy th CD to which works fine except no labels there either.  Shows up as CD # whatever an song # whatever so you don't know what the song plaid, currently playing, or what's next is.  Only shows up as Album as a number and the number of the song.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|everytime I am on here it doesn't refresh fast enough or it will continually shut down. this is so annoying. I has its good times. but overall it sucks and I hate it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|We all love playing this game in my house. Graphics are amazing. It follows the storyline. You don't have to play all the time to do neat things.  We wish there were more mini games. There is one right now that is really cute. The movies are a great idea. I especially liked the behind the scenes one. What we all deeply appreciate is that acorns can be earned and won without money. It is so frustrating to play games where you can not get the really cool things unless you pay money. Please please keep up the great work. We will vote 5 stars every time! Thanks!!  ~ The Smith Family
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The perfect survival knife is all but impossible to find, my list of criteria that I look for in a survival knight is pretty demanding and includes the following items:<br /><br />Around 10 inch overall length<br />Full tang (the metal of the blade runs all the way to the butt of the knife)<br />High carbon steel (holds an edge longer than stainless)<br />Straight blade, no serration (easier to sharpen in the field)<br />Pronounced hilt, fingers won’t slip onto blade<br />Thick steel, can be used to pry and not bend or break<br />Removable handle grips (can be wrapped in paracord)<br />Made in the U.S.A.<br /><br />That said the KA-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion Fixed Blade Knife is the closest to perfect that I have found. Although this knife is a little heavier than I would like, I strongly recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|Although I do still love A Thousand Splendid Suns, this novel was beautiful to read. It makes you ache, probably cry more than once, but most of all, long for the reunion of a family you have never met but already feel you are a part of.
B00007KWHO|5.0|This &#34;album&#34; had everything I wanted on it.  It's hard to find copies of &#34;Dear Father&#34; and the ones I have are starting to fade.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is a pretty good mouse, especially considering the price tag. 8000 dpi is nice, and I like the programmable buttons. I haven't used the macro recorder, so I really don't know how well that works, but it could be useful. I don't know how useful the weight tuning cartridge is (I have all the weights in), but some may want a lighter mouse. The mouse looks nice, and while being able to change the light color of the anchor on it is slightly gimmicky, it does look neat. Good value, would recommend.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This was a good series, sorry it did not last very long.  I just learned about it a few weeks ago and bought it, no regrets.

B005T87QCI|2.0|It's not that great there's only like six robots you fight so in my opinion it's lame. I was playing it and there's no Zeus. Zeus is the main character and there is no Adam. So don`t buy the game it's a rip off.
B002PLALCO|5.0|Ordered this for my brother, and of course I had to preview it for him.  If I like an artist I will usually order the cd, but I very rarely order music videos.  I found this one had great music and was a lot of fun.  What really surprised me was when it quieted down for a song or a musical solo.  There where also some very beautiful moments up in the air.  Pink is very talented, and has great acrobatic skills.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an awesome, awesome, awesome movie. As a parent, it really touched me. I encourage all dads to watch it, print out the contract, and make the committment (you'll see in the movie).<br /><br />Powerful message. Extremely motivating!! A+
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|More like the first How to Destroy Angels product. More enjoyable than the previous product. I hope that NIN includes some of these songs on its next tour.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A wonderful yet sad story.  So much cruelty shown to children by men and women of the cloth.  A story of a child's unbearable suffering who can still find strength as an adult to show love and kindness.
B001F12J0C|4.0|I ENJOYED HAVING ALL THE MOVIES TO WATCH IN SUCCESSION. THAT WAY I DIDN'T FORGET PARTS OF THE PREVIOUS ONES
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I do not get the hype behind this book. Pat Peoples, the main character, seemed borderline mentally challenged as opposed to mentally unstable. Some of the things he would say and how he would say them...had me wondering how I was supposed to believe he was an educator before he went to the \\"bad place\\". I thought the dysfunction of his family was portrayed well - sadly, it is something I am all too familiar with. As a reader, I felt there were some unanswered questions pertaining to Nikki and his father. Other than that, it was okay.  I saw the movie after reading the book and for the first time ever, it was a WAY better story than the book.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|As a life-long fan of the original series, it's great to finally see it up to date.  The enhanced special effects are amazing!  They make the show modern without taking anything away from the original intent.  And, if you wish, you can still see the old effects as they were in the 60's.  I highly recommend this collection to all Star Trek fans!
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I know everyone says this, but the book was much better!  Having just finished the book, I was excited to see the movie; I could not be more disappointed.<br /><br />I would have been very confused about what was going on if I hadn't read the book. Obviously going from book to movie, there are many things that need to be left out, but the timeline was changed significantly from one to the other.  None of the characters reasons for doing things made sense, because we didn't have their background.  The whole movie was confusing.<br /><br />The acting wasn't great, either. I normally like Scarlett and Natalie, but they did nothing for me in this movie.  Do yourself a favor and skip it!
B005K2YRVG|5.0|This was exactly what I was expecting - nothing less and nothing more.  It is perfect for what I wanted when traveling with my Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator app that I have used.  This calc is very easy to use and I love the history feature that is offered.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Kept me occupied for a while but after a bit I got pretty bored and deleted it. Which I can't totally blame on the game. Just wasn't enough to keep my attention for very long.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This  game is very entertaining and never gets old! Om Nom is so cute, you don't want to put this  game down. Good graphics. 5 Stars!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Little slow at first. Good movie but takes so many twists and turns that if you knew that at the beginning you would be like dude, WTF?
B00BR476TG|5.0|I know this is a good movie but I have not watched it yet. Hope to do so in the near future.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie. Unfortunately we all new how it was going to end, since it really did happen, but, I still find it amazing that they would rather have people filming a movie about aliens from space rather that Americans in their country... Hey! It worked:-P
159463176X|3.0|This book was a letdown. It started off very well, with a philisophical story about the grey areas of life; rights and wrongs. I was reading the book, thinking how well Hosseini seems to bring out the unnoticed details and poignancy of day-to-day life and human behaviours. The 'div' story was wonderful, so touching. The Rumi quote was amazing, a glimpse of the story to come.<br /><br />100 pages or so, into the book, the story started shifting timelines. Okay, fine.....after the next 100 pages, it seemed like another writer or even multiple writers had taken control. From there on, the story shifts decades back and forth like gears. Some fillers like the Greek man's story, Roshin's story, etc, were given too much focus.<br /><br />The storyline picks up speed or slows down abruptly, like a newbie driving a car. The ending felt loose, disappointing.<br /><br />There isn't any depth to the numerous characters introduced in the book. Most of them seem highly forgettable, unlike Mariam, Laila, Hassan, Sohrab, Baba or even Assef! I do not know if I would remember the character Pari or Nila.<br /><br />Also, it seems like the author has developed a new style of writing. 'Kite Runner' and 'Splendid Suns' had that exotic Afghan specialty in it. The style was special because it had the author's trademark magic.<br /><br />However, this book tries to be global and chic.....and it fails. What a huge disappointment from one of the finest, most emotional writers of these times.<br /><br />Oh well, who knows - I may read this book again after some months and really like it. After all, one can only like KH's writing, which comes from the heart and aims at the reader's heartstrings.
B004TI5N38|1.0|Awful in every sense including implausible scenarios, plodding development, stilted dialog, and one-dimensional characters. Truly frightening that this man sells so many books.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I love her books. I was expecting this one to be on the same par as the older ones but it fell a little short of that for me.
B005LAII12|5.0|Funny movie, cracked me up throughout the movie.  I think my wife thought I needed to be committed!  The scene on the cash register belt killed me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game learning new things about the game. It's a cool game found out about the game from my sister and cousins always saying how cool the game is.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This is very easy to understand and use.  Great app.  I highly recommend it for all ages and devices.  A++++++
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome game but it needs achievements.other than the distance one.you should really get it.it's free and you don't get games like this very often.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is one of the best search engines and easy to use.  I highly recommend it for all ages and devices.
B008532S54|5.0|How this movie wasn't rated better is beyond me.<br /><br />Okay so the story line is nothing original and you can see certain things coming, but the comedy is all original and awesome.
1401923127|5.0|This is an amazing read.  I bought the audio book first and have listened to it twice.  I bought this hard copy to give to a friend.  It is an amazing read that will change the way you think about yourself and the world around you.  Recommended.

My dear friends, I learned every single one of the songs and I could sing the entire record after just a couple of listens.  When I was sixteen years of age.  Deep breath.  It's not so hard.  It's a Cubist interpretation of black music.  Duh.  The history of American popular music is the history of theft from Black people.  If you don't agree, well, there are members of Congress who will serve you well.  ALL AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC IS EITHER BLACK OR BORROWED.  THERE IS NO OTHER.<br /><br />Fact is, Beefheart (or Don, as everyone seems to affectionately know him, and I didn't), used the American (meaning Black) idiom as  a kind of canvas.  Totally with respect.  He melded all the great American geniuses and many others as well, including the Europeans and, on some occasions, Asian, but not so much.  I would place Van Vliet in the ranks with Stravinsky, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Picasso, Dali, Ono, and of course, our greatest American composer, Frank Zappa, about whom no one can speak ill.  (If you do, go get yourself some statues erected in your honor in Europe.)<br /><br />People who like velvet paintings with big eyes and glossy Elvis tears are not going to like this record.  Anyone who has listened to Varese, say, or some Miles Davis, or anyone who has listened to anyone who wrote anything after our beloved masters of Americana,  from Foster to Manilow, will probably find it challenging and highly introspective, if introspective means seeing what is within.  Which I thought it meant, but that is not of your concern.<br /><br />This canvas is the American experience, and it's like some photograph of a post Katrina neighborhood in New Orleans:  boards poking out everywhere, weird colors battered and weathered, strange birds perched on the rubble, and a child picking up a piece of something that got left.<br /><br />If you can't get this record, please excuse yourself and head off to Blake, and I do not mean William.  Real roots music here, just chopped up raw and served on your plate, no questions asked, by a woman who might be named Irene.  Or Harry.<br /><br />This is one for the ages.  It may be too much for your mirror, but disown that sardonic smile at your own peril.br /><br />If you can't get this record, please excuse yourself and head off to Blake, and I do not mean William.

B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I first played this game on PC and didn't care for it. Even with interesting gameplay features, I found it to be too frustrating. Using the mouse doesn't always do what I wanted it to do. When I saw this as the \\"free app of the day\\" on Amazon, I figured I'd give it a shot on mobile. It's significantly better on mobile, mainly due to the touchscreen interface. It's easier to make quick accurate motions with a finger than a mouse. I'm not sure if it helps, but my phone has a much smaller screen than my PC and I think it was easier to observe the entire playing field at once on a smaller device.<br /><br />This game is basically Bejeweled with RPG elements. I love Bejeweled with nearly 50 hours clocked in on Bejeweled 3. If you're familiar with those types of block matching games, it's pretty easy to pick this up and play.<br /><br />The game can be frustrating. You need to make appropriate matches to meet the needs of your character who is running a dungeon at the top of the screen. If there's a locked door or chest, you need to match keys. If it's a monster, you need to match swords or staves. When you're not doing that, you want to match wood and stone to upgrade various shops. Sometimes you just don't get the types of blocks you need and the game delivers a brutal beating if you stop to consider your options. You have to keep matching non-stop to advance. If you hesitate, it's over. Some of the dungeon objectives are survival-based like \\"stay alive for 90 seconds.\\" It's not as easy as that sounds. As you upgrade your armor, weapons, and abilities, however, the game's difficulty decreases. One ability, for example, reduces the number of keys to open locks to just one key.<br /><br />10000000 is a fun game. It took me about 2.5 hours to level up all my items and rooms and beat the game. It's still fun to replay.

B004PKO5AM|4.0|By sheer coincidence, two video documentaries appeared a few years back from Europe about the conductor Carlos Kleiber.  One was \\"Traces to Nowhere\\", and this, \\"Carlos Kleiber: I Am Lost to the World\\" is the other.  This is the shorter of the two, by nearly a quarter hour, but of the two, it actually tries to probe deeper psychologically into the man.  It also brings more to the fore the inherent tensions in the relationship between the father (Erich) and the son (Carlos), when one is the son of a great conductor, and himself expresses interest in becoming a conductor.  Erich tried to dissuade Carlos at first, as is generally known, but after a period at university attempting to study chemistry (and also chasing girls, apparently), Carlos went back to his father to say that he still wanted to be a conductor.  So things went from there.<br /><br />The psychological probing from some of the interviewees brings up some questionable ideas, at least to me, such as regarding the possibility that the Kleiber parents may have had suicidal tendencies, and perhaps even acted on them at their respective ends, although the film explicitly does not state this as such.  The interviewees kind of toss in the idea.  The film even has an extreme possibility, if you strain to read between the lines, of this scenario with respect to the end of Carlos Kleiber's own life, not long after the death of his wife Stanka.  In fact, the film notes the terrible coincidence of Carlos being diagnosed with cancer just around the time of the death of his wife.<br /><br />Also compared to the other film, the interviewees here seem willing to dish a bit more of the dirt, in a manner of speaking, regarding such issues as to how Kleiber could drive musicians around the bend with his incessant demands when they already seem to be giving 200% to him.  There's also greater, though not terribly extended, mention of his inside reputation as a womanizer, even naming at least one name in Lucia Popp, to the point where he said to her essentially \\"let's live together\\".  One interviewee even claimed that for Kleiber's rare guest appearances in the USA, the Americans also met Kleiber's demands in that realm (though not the Germans, of course).  There is also the briefest allusion that his wife Stanka knew about her husband's proclivities in that area, and how it must have affected her.  But the film also mentions that Kleiber was very saddened after his wife's death.<br /><br />Several interviewees overlap between the two films, namely the oboist Klaus Konig, the director Otto Schenk, fellow conductor Michael Gielen, and Kleiber biographer Alexander Werner.  One interesting contrast is that Gielen here appears more willing to reveal how difficult Kleiber could be, compared to the other film, though Gielen still acknowledges Kleiber's greatness, of course.  However, several notable figures appear here who are not in the other film, including Riccardo Muti, Wolfgang Sawallisch and Peter Jonas, the latter two from the Bavarian State Opera, where Kleiber spent a notable amount of time in his career (relatively speaking).  Likewise, several musicians from the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, the NDR Symphony, as well as the Bavarian State Opera share their memories, with at least one willing to say clearly that Kleiber wasn't always Herr Nice Guy.  Ileana Cotrubas (Violetta in Kleiber's DG recording of \\"La Traviata\\") is rare among the interviewees in being a singer, while for knowledgeable Americans, it's interesting to see Pamela Rosenberg, past 'Intendantin' of the Berlin Philharmonic, make a brief appearance to talk about Kleiber.  Rather curiously, both of them are featured either just before the passage, or in the midst of, the passage that goes into Kleiber's womanizing, with particular mention by Rosenberg of how charming and charismatic he could be with the ladies.<br /><br />Both documentaries share some footage that has appeared in another DVD of rehearsalof the overtures to \\"Der Freischutz\\" and \\"Die Fledermaus\\".  Where this film has an edge in that regard is in also showing rehearsal footage from the Bayreuth Festspielhaus orchestra pit, presumably from video cameras set up for off-stage singers to be able to see him, and also from the Vienna Philharmonic in preparing for the New Year's Day concert, where of course cameras had to be set up in advance.  In fact, it's kind of funny to read a Vienna Philharmonic player telling Kleiber that the audience will clap along during the \\"Radeztky March\\", and Kleiber's apparent appalled reaction.  It's hard to believe that Kleiber wouldn't know in advance that this would happen.  There is evidently also surreptitiously recorded audio rehearsal footage from an extremely rare appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic.<br /><br />This film's ultimate trump card is that it features audio excerpts of the one recorded interview that exists of Kleiber, a 1960 German radio interview, where he does talk about his father a bit, and his musical upbringing.  During the film, several interviewees elaborated on the fact that Kleiber never gave interviews, and also why he didn't, but apparently in ignorance of this one audio document.<br /><br />There are some quirks and apparent Google Translator-ish errors in the English presentation, such as one apparent mistranslation in the subtitles of \\"counterpoint\\" as \\"contrabass\\" (the word that Kleiber used was \\"kontrapunkt\\"), and at one point to describe a particular instrumentalist, \\"deep blower\\", and a mistranslation of \\"stadium\\" for the word for \\"stage\\".<br /><br />So if you come across these two video documentaries of Carlos Kleiber, it's probably not a choice of one or the other as \\"better\\".  You'll probably want to watch both, since for the most part, the material is fairly non-overlapping and Kleiber fans will want to take it all in.of the overtures to \\"Der Freischutz\\" and \\"Die Fledermaus\\".

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a deep and thought provoking story about a teen age boy who is accused of murder. His father, an assistant District Attorney, is determined to prove his son's innocence.  The book is very solidly written and takes the reader on a long circuitous trip through suspicion, hope, and intense emotion.  It's a very serious account of courtroom drama that will have you begging for the conclusion.  The book delves deep and delivers absolutely.  An excellent read.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I absolutely adore this album. This is a new beginning for this 30 Seconds to Mars. Some may not like it because it's different from their other 3 albums. This band is not satisfied with the same music they've put out before. You can tell this band put their heart and soul into the album. I found the album to be fresh, personal, emotional, sexual, raw, light, dark, and grand. I have listened to this album almost nonstop since it came out on May 21st and have not gotten tired of it yet. It's okay if some do not like it. . . it may not be for everyone, as the band isn't the favorite of everyone. However, I would encourage you to listen to it unbiased without any sort of opinion on Jared Leto himself or the previous albums. These guys worked really hard on this album and poured themselves in it like they do everything. It's not only this album or the three previous albums that make me love this band - it's also the fact that they take the time to include their family (or you might call them fans) as part of their journey. I have NEVER seen a band take time to go out on the street and play guitar and sing or chat with them online among other things. I personally feel other musicians/bands could take a clue from these guys. I love Jared, Shannon, and Tomo and am proud of them. I'm part of the Echelon. . . and I'm damn proud to say so.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|I got hooked on this game.  I like flying around trading things in space, but there needs to be some kind of update for like end game type fights, or some kind of end goal to reach.  I loved the game FTL as well, but even that game had a main objective.  Maybe even if the objective was to assist factions into ultimately destroying each other, helping one side conquer the other's planets, or defending all the factions against the aliens.  I would also like for there to be a timer for the faction conflicts, so I could know when trade embargos would end and I could strategize more efficiently.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Life goes on.  People pass along.  Nothin' stays the same.<br /><br />Terrence Malick, at his best, is bewitching.  He casts a spell of deep calm.  This is true despite the opening suggestion for The Tree of Life (2011):  \\"For optimal sound reproduction, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend that you play it loud.\\"  Loud I did play it and they were quite in the right.  It is a terrific accomplishment of sight and sound.  It ought to have come with another warning:  \\"For optimal viewing, the producers of this Blu-Ray recommend you see it big.\\" I have now seen all of Terrence Malick's movies and this is easily the most ambitious.  It's about life and death, the universe and our place in it, God and deep human emotion.  What else is there?  When you leave this movie, and this is mostly true of the other Malick movies, you walk out to the edge of a sharp cliff and you can see down, far below you lie all other movies.  They simply do not compete for ambition, maturity, thoughtfulness, and beauty.  It just feels like something completely different.<br /><br />This is the story of a family.  In what looks to be the late 60's, Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) receives a telegram and finds out that one of her sons has been killed.  She and Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) are hit hard by the loss.  In the present day, Jack (Sean Penn) is working as an architect in Dallas.  He is preoccupied with his past and contemplates life.  The universe is born, galaxies formed, planets emerge, and on Earth life is created.  Jack is born, brief moments of his early life go by, then his brothers are born and, in their young teenage years, the bulk of the story is told.  Mr. O'Brien is tough on his sons R.L. (Laramie Eppler) and Steve (Tye Sheridan), but on the eldest son, Jack (Hunter McCracken), he is too tough.  All of his own failings and troubles he takes out on Jack in the thought that he's getting him ready for life as he knows it to be.  As Jack grows older, he has difficulty dealing withhis thoughts and emotions about his father, his mother, pain, God, loss, plus all the ordinary things a young boy has to deal with.<br /><br />I think that the reason I never--but maybe once--thought about this movie being pretentious is that I basically ignore the voice overs.  They feel to me to be optional.  You can take a dip, listen in, but if you focus too hard, something else will pass you by.  That's what makes The Tree of Life such a great movie.  It's a beautiful film to watch (cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki) as it is to listen to its score (Alexandre Desplat) or soundtrack.  Let me underline that, the score and soundtrack is perfect.  The story is told as impressionistic.  You only get an impression from one shot, whether it's a tear on Jack's face or a piece of dialogue, which will only last a moment before it cuts to another shot that might be Jack coming home and Mrs. O'Brien responding to Jack's hugging or avoiding her.<br /><br />Cut cut cut cut cut which keeps the energy of the film driving forward, developing your sense of the story and character.  A movie is a rapid substitution of one picture for another, slightly different picture that gives the illusion of motion.  That's how The Tree of Life operates.  It's a delightful thing if you can watch it without conscious thought.  I understand there are many of you out there--the sort that likes to guess the outcomes of mysteries, for example--that just can't find the dimmer on their brain to passively enjoy a movie.  This is how I watch most movies.  I turn down the lights and let the movie impress upon me.  I suspect that this is why I enjoy The Tree of Life and To the Wonder (2013) (review) so much.  When I can't turn it off or a movie isn't immersive enough to force it off, then it's going to be tough for me to enjoy.<br /><br />The cosmic interlude, if you haven't seen the movie, may strike the cynical viewer--and I certainly sympathize--as pretention writ large.  Believe me when I tell you,it is astounding.  Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is supposed to have one redeeming quality in the beauty of his planetary waltz.  I'm having trouble finding words to describe how far it is surpassed by The Tree of Life.  Obviously, that movie is a technical marvel for the time--with roughly twice the budget of The Tree of Life when adjusted for inflation--but the imagination on display during Malick's sequence is unparalleled.  What makes it so great, and I think aloud here, is that it is still imbued with Malick's maturity and his eye, like he's capturing the moment without having planned it.  Just \\"here it is.\\"<br /><br />I was all set to say \\"Take that Stanley Kubrick!  And that Steven Spielberg!\\"  But what begins as a major ass kicking of Jurassic Park (1993) by Malick's dinosaurs captured in the wild droops just enough for a moment to give Spielberg the win.  The movement was too smooth, the steps weirdly on the wrong vertical plane.  It is the first of two errors.  The second comes at the end of the film with Chastain cupping and uncapping of her hands against the sun.  Both moments broke the spell.  Up until then, Malick was nowhere to be seen or felt other than in my super-conscience, to give credit to when I felt something awesome.  Then, comes a repetition of movement in such quick succession that looked so much like a \\"cool thing to do\\" that I was a bit annoyed.<br /><br />Otherwise the performances were very good.  Those boys were astoundingly good.  Tye Sheridan, you may not be aware, is the lead in Mud (2013) (review) where he was very good as well--obviously, he had a lot more dialogue in Mud.  Hunter McCracken is arguably the lead in this movie and he carries many scenes on his young shoulders.  The Tree of Life is something like a mid-point, dialogue-wise, between To the Wonder and a normal movie.  There are some scenes in The Tree of Life where you can hear full exchanges, but mostly it is impressionistic, non-explanatory voice-overs and never a full, conventionally constructed scene.  That makes it relatively difficult to judge performance levels.  Really, Sean Penn just lets his wrinkly face do his acting for him.  If, however, we accept the view that evoking a feeling is a sign of a good performance, then everyone did the best work of their lives.  Brad Pitt should possibly be given special special mention for, legitimately, giving the best performance of his career as a hard, frustrated, mostly unlikeable man.  I haven't seen Moneyball (2011) yet, but I find it hard to imagine that it was anything with as much depth or range as in this movie.<br /><br />The Tree of Life was up for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards in 2012.  For Best Picture I can imagine that The Artist (2011) hit more heartstrings and faux-nostalgia to make it voter friendly, but Best Director (Michel Hazanavicius for The Artist) and Best Cinematography ( Robert Richardson for Hugo (2011)) are comically wrong.  I would have liked to have seen Jessica Chastain rewarded somewhere, but I suppose a nomination for The Help (2011) is something--something like a backhanded compliment, possibly.  Perhaps it's hypocrisy to complain that voters didn't watch one of the top three movies of the year when I hadn't seen it until just now, but I imagine that The Tree of Life didn't receive more accolades than it did because people couldn't be bothered to watch a movie they thought would be too artsy.  It isn't hard, it too artsy, it's just good, accessible modern art.<br /><br />Read more at ProfRatigan.Wordpress.com

First enters Pine whose wife has a restraining order out on him as he is walking into his first day on the job at the train yard.Next is Denzel who has 28 years under his belt,but is getting short pensioned after 28 years.He and his colleagues are less than cordial to Pine who blame he and his ilk for their  fall in fortunes.Denzel is partnered with Pine who is conducting the train.They take an engine out to retrieve a train load of zinc and return it to the yard.<br />Meanwhile in the yard circumstances are set into motion which will change many lives.A lazy train worker gets sloppy,jumps off a slow moving train to change a switch,but the controls he left in place slip and change,setting the locomotive off on its own.It picks up speed and is bound eventually for the highly populated city of Scranton,Pa.Back down the same line the train is headed toward is Denzel and Pine.Frantic efforts and ideas to stop the train from the yard master and her underlings meet with no success.A later effort to derail the train purposely also is going to fail,but Denzel and Pine decide to race in reverse after the train in an attempt to hook up to it and slow it down.This they manage to do but it isn't enough.Pine gets injured in the attempt and Denzel decides to go topside of the runaway train cars and manually hit each ones brakes.This does the trick and the train manages to make it through a bad curve in Scranton.<br />Their engine's brakes have failed and the runaway is picking up speed again.Denzel is stuck and can't get over a car loaded with pipes.A fast moving pick up truck of an employee who has been following them comes by and picks up Pine.He races him to the front of the train and Pine just manages to grab on the rail,get aboard and finally stop the train.<br />The film ends as both men are being celebrated.Pine has gotten back together with his wife and Denzel has had his pension and job reinstated.<br />Once the introductions are over and the train is in runaway mode,the film's tension just never lets up.The late director Scott did a bang up job here,and the actors manage to convey their characters as just two ordinary guys caught up in circumstances beyond their control.The action on and around both trains is spectacular as police cordone off roads,helicopters fly in pursuit and tensions amongst the railroad brass build to a crescendo.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,featurettes and deleted scenes.<br />All in all one movie full of tension and action.The actors do a spot on job with their characters and director Scott did a great job throughout.This was Scott's second to last film.Recommended.in and Pine just manages to grab on the rail,get aboard and finally stop the train.<br />The film ends as both men are being celebrated.Pine has gotten back together with his wife and Denzel has had his pension and job reinstated.<br />Once the introductions are over and the train is in runaway mode,the film's tension just never lets up.The late director Scott did a bang up job here,and the actors manage to convey their characters as just two ordinary guys caught up in circumstances beyond their control.The action on and around both trains is spectacular as police cordone off roads,helicopters fly in pursuit and tensions amongst the railroad brass build to a crescendo.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary,featurettes and deleted scenes.<br />All in all one movie full of tension and action.The actors do a spot on job with their characters and director Scott did a great job throughout.This was Scott's second to last film.Recommended.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook (released Nov/12)stars,among others,Bradley Cooper as Pat,Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany,Robert De Niro as Pat Sr.,Jacki Weaver as Dolores and Chris Tucker as Danny.This is a quirky,crazy tale of a man dealing with a terrible bi-polar disorder and who ultimately wins his struggle against it.In the process it reunites his family and creates and new life for himself,independent of his past phobias.<br />Pat is being sprung from the local psychiatric facility by his mother,who is taking a risk doing so.He has been in the institution for eight months,has skipped his meds and while wants his freedom is of two minds about it(no pun intended).He was originally put into the facility for beating up a co worker having sex with his wife,whom he caught in the act.His wife left him but he still harbours thoughts that it can all be worked out again and returned to the way it was.<br />Back at home his father(DeNiro) also has mixed feelings of being reunited with his son,whom his wife didn't tell.His father is a sports fanatic and overly superstitious when it comes to his team.He seems to feel that Pat brings him and his team luck by just them being together watching the games.One evening Pat attends a dinner at a friends house and it is there he meets a young lady(Tiffany),also with some issues that need attending to.She is outspoken and says what she feels,but Pat also has his similar quirky ways.The two leave the dinner early when Tiffany just HAS to go.The conversation home is awkward at best,but a spark has been lit between the two which will grow brighter as the movie winds its way to the end.<br />Pat has been working out to get in shape for a return to his ex,whom he writes a letter to and gives to Tiffany to give to her.Pat will find out the truth eventually,but Tiffany writes a response to Pat herself,which Pat falls for in the short term.But in order for Pat to even get the letter delivered in the first place,Tiffany makes Pat enter a dance competition with her.The two practice and practice.During this time Pat has more than a few bad spells with his parent's and the local police, because he refuses to take his meds.His father bets big on his team against an old friend,and loses a big sum.When Pat comes home from dance practice his father is beside himself,blaming Pat for his misfortune.Tiffany arrives and tells Pat's father in no uncertain terms it was not Pat's fault.In fact she goes on in great detail to tell him his team won more times when she and Pat were together.This gets the father to thinking she is right and he makes a double or nothing bet wit his friend.The friend raises his proposition to include Pat and Tiffany getting at least a 5 out of 10 rating in their dance contest.<br />The pressure is on both Pat,his father and Tiffany,who has fallen for Pat but who keeps whingeing on about his ex.The night of the contest arrives.Pat's father's team has won there series and now it is up to Pat and Tiffany. However Pat's ex actually shows up and Tiffany figure's she will lose Pat after it is all over.She has a couple of vodka's<br />to stiffen her resolve and they both go on.They know they're entirely out of their league but they give it their best.The two receive a five rating and Pat's father's bet is won.Pat has a confidential word with his ex and Tiffany rushes off broken hearted.Pat catches up with her,as he obviously has told his ex he has fallen for Tiffany.The film ends as Pat and Tiffany are at Pat's home enjoying everyone's company,including their own.Pat is back on his meds and is doing fine.<br />This is certainly a heart warming tale,on top of the obvious look into mental illness.One also sees many characteristics in other characters,especially Pat's father who definitely has OCD,that could apply to many of the viewers of this film.Mental illness can sometimes be a subjective thing.Lawrence nicely plays Tiffany as a hard nosed woman,who admits to a variety of dalliances in her past,who has many issues and almost becomes a stalker to poor Pat.And I must say I don't know who corralled,roped and hog tied Chris Tucker,but this is the most under played performance I have ever seen him give in ANY film.And I liked it immensely.I know Lawrence received a statue for her performance but....why? Cooper is the real and central star here and if anyone deserved an OSCAR it was him.But to tell the truth,I don't believe there was ANY OSCAR performances in this film at all.The Academy decisions re the handing out of their prizes has baffled me over and over again for many a year now.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette.<br />All in all a delightful but quirky look at mental illness with a stellar cast.Highly recommended.4-4 1/2 stars.any issues and almost becomes a stalker to poor Pat.And I must say I don't know who corralled,roped and hog tied Chris Tucker,but this is the most under played performance I have ever seen him give in ANY film.And I liked it immensely.I know Lawrence received a statue for her performance but....why?

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Why doesn't this version have GameCenter??? I have like 2 friends on facebook and one of them hardly ever plays. Its no fun if the social aspect of the game is depleted. Please add gamecenter so i, as well as many others, can enjoy this amazing game, which by the way, is my favorite game ever!!! Great graphics, smooth gameplay, no glitches, just an awesome game!!! There just needs to be an easier way to acquire gems. Maybe add a gem mine or a way to swap out coins for gems. More mini games would make it more awesome too! Thanx.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My son wanted to download this via TIVO/Amazon on Demand videos. He read the book and wanted to see the movie. I didn't know anything about Percy Jackson and found myself really enjoying this movie. I found it appropriate for my 9 yr old. Two thumbs up!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Beautiful movie in all aspects. Grant, Kelly, and Hitchcock in a masterpiece. Makes you long for the glamour days on the riviera.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|So far easy and fun to play !!graphics are cute ,easy to level I love games like this! It's a must play !!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works well with my Android type tablet you will truly enjoy using it anf the price is right so enjoy it
B00CL68BK2|3.0|My wife had wanted to see this for the longes time, she had read the book. Mostly she felt she was a disappointed viewer because of how the movie's story departed from the book's story. I having not read the book didn't feel it was a super great movie on it's own. Clearly slapped two people hot on peoples tongues, on a bad adaptation of a very good book. Two edgier lesser know actresses woud have done much better in these roles. And staying true to the book's story would have allowed some more edgy people to be cast.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I am a grown up child and love animated films, I loved this. All the references to old school games were fun, and the story line and voices just added to my anticipation of this movie.
B00BESCJII|3.0|meh, wasn't terrible worth  watch, but though it'd be a bit more convincing of a movie. Not unhappy I saw it, but wont be rushing to watch again.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|the wife and I sat down to watch this after all the awards season hubbub, and we must say that we agree. In a time where movies seem to be trending behind a &#34;dark & dreary&#34; i.e. (let's redo snow white, with a dark edge to it!, let's redo Batman, again, and make him EVEN DARKER) this movie was a welcome departure from that recent trend. This story very much took a dark subject matter and paints it in a warm vibrant light, although the story itself is very dramatic, the way the story is chosen to be told, works wonders. Will definitely watch this movie again.
B00BI745AA|5.0|My Wife absolutely loved it so I'll give it 5 stars. I'm not a musical guy, but this was a well done production of a movie musical. It is long so take an intermission!
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Ive watched it over and over since it came out. This is a must have for your video collection. If you don't own it all I can say is , This Aggression Will Not Stand, Man!.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|This is a great movie to keep the children quite so I can have a moment to my self. I don't have to worry about content.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved the whole book. I love Nicholas Sparks and how he brings the characters so alive for the reader. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good love story. There was no sex in it as is in many books today, which in my opinion is more romantic. It just showed the love a man has for one woman and how he would do anything to make her happy, while making himself happy also.
0446547646|5.0|This book was given to me in a book swap and it was so great. The characters were well flushed out and drew you easily into the story. It wasn't much time at all before I wanted to climb into the book and give Dawson a hug and have a \\"Girls Day Out\\" chat with Amanda. The story flowed easily from one point to the next and every point felt like it was needed. There were a few parts that I was like \\"Meh are these really needed, maybe I should skip to the next section\\" (these parts were usually when a secondary character took over the book for a few paragraphs) but in the end I'm glad I decided to stick through them and read them as it the end that much better.<br /><br />Ultimately this is a great Nicholas Sparks book, complete with needing the box of Kleenex at the end. The end of the last chapter was so spectacularly unexpected and that made it all the more heartbreaking. If you are paying attention to the book by this point you know how the Epilogue will end but still reading it will bring a tear to your eye.
B003TH14H4|5.0|The writing on this show is excellent. The chemistry between the two main characters is palpable. Really enjoy the &#34;dance&#34;. Looking forward to more of the same.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome! I play it every day. This game rocks! U should totally get out is the best game ever<br />I totally rate it five stars
B00COMLLX2|5.0|Zen has brought their talents to the small screen,  with the same attention to detail, and innovation as they have in the past. The Marvel tables are great, and the Star Wars venues are fun yet, challenging. Kudos Zen.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought that this book was really fun to read, and most kids in school can relate to at least one aspect/idea of it
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this movie was beautifully crafted, imaginative and featured some great actors.<br /><br />It was also confusing. And looooonnnggg.<br /><br />We have watched the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy. I am not a devotee, but I enjoyed them. The story did move along. In &#34;The Hobbit,&#34; I think you had to have read the books a few dozen times to follow what was happening.<br /><br />I suspect this is a minority opinion. But I really think the filmmakers are working hard to cram one movie's worth of content into three films. Ka-ching!!!!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this product.  The best thing ever.  So easy to read and understand. Would definitely recommend this application to all my friends.
B004X2M3N8|4.0|I viewed the entire 6th season over a long weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the series. The mystery and social commentary make it entertaining and a little thought provoking at the same time. The special effects got better with technology but you should expect that after a long successful run.
B0015DROBO|5.0|One thing that I really enjoyed about this book was that the protagonists didn't get great ideas that always worked out. They followed lots of leads, but many of them didn't pan out, which is much more realistic than most mysteries that I have read.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan brown has a way to teach subtleties of erudition in his writings... This book is consistent with that thought... On the other hand, I prefer The Da Vinci Code, and Angels And Demons...
B008IJT0CE|2.0|Each sound can have its own volume but need to stop and select again to adjust it after you've selected it and playing...<br /><br />and I hope my heartbeat doesn't sound like the one in the app because I can't hear anything...<br /><br />I played around for 20 minutes and uninstalled it because the interface wasn't that great...I prefer simple app like Rain Therapy or for more complicated White Noise...
B005CRQ3H0|3.0|But it's entertaining and soon to be a major motion picture. What nonsense to have a minimum amount of words.
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|I bought this book because I had seen the movie *The Cloud Atlas.* I wanted to read the book on which it was based.  This is not that book!  The movie was based on the book of the almost identical title by David Mitchell.  Still haven't gotten around to reading that one.  By the time I figured out that I was reading the wrong book, I was completely engrossed.  This is a fascinating read about a little-known WWII initiative, some interesting characters, and a bit of Inuit spritiualism.  One of the most enjoyable mistakes I've made in a long time.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  The concept presented in this book will change the world.  When the world is ready to change that is.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|The Evoluent Mouse is basically a hybrid between the 3-button drafting/CG mice of the 90's crossed with modern consumer optical mice-- tilted sideways to reduce wrist strain.  If you work long crunch hours for protracted periods in the CG industry you will find yourself loving this mouse.<br /><br />Here are my personal experiences with this mouse:<br /><br />Evoluent advantages over standard mice:<br /><br />Having a real, dedicated middle-mouse button reduces middle-finger knuckle and tendon strain.  Mouse wheels as middle-mouse buttons tend to require more pressure than regular mouse buttons, they force your finger into a harsh clawing arch, and they break more quickly than regular mouse buttons when used for extended time.  The sideways tilt of the mouse seems like a gimmick but it stabilizes the wrist quite well, aligning it more naturally with the radius and ulna.<br /><br />Evoluent 4 (Small) improvements over Evoluent 2:<br /><br />On the Evoluent 2 you might find yourself kind of crossing your pinky into your ringfinger and scraping your pinky along your desk, on the Evoluent 4 they increased the width of the lowest button and provided a lip for you to rest your pinky- effectively fixing this issue.<br /><br />The Evoluent 4 has much more responsive buttons (or maybe I wore them out on the 2) and the cutout where you pinch the side of the mouse between your thumb and index is more naturally formed.<br /><br />It looks nicer and has cool lights and stuff.  They could probably open a new market by going even more bold with the aesthetics (like Razer) of this mouse and bill it as an ergonomic Gamer mouse.  The sensitivity and accuracy of this mouse is already comparable to most gaming mice.<br /><br />I'm 5'7&#34; and I find the small version to be a roomy-fitting mouse, I heard some folks say the large version of this mouse is quite large.<br /><br />This is a great mouse to try out if you experience pain from mousing for extended periods at work, or if you started drafting/cg in the 90's and you miss having a 3-button mouse.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|We thought it was very cute, especially since we are expexting as well!  I would recommnd this movie, its worth a watch.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Very good graphics, excellent storyline, plenty of hidden object scenes. Not overly difficult but plenty of things to do so it took several hours to finish. Did not need any hints. In-game notebook with map and objectives is good to have. Well worth the purchase. Will definitely go for sequel.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|I hated the end and expected more overall. From the previews, I expected the best horror film ever, I was very disappointed!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Love touching plants!<br />I like touching fish too.<br />I like to watch it swim around.<br />I like the pretty fish and pretty plants.<br />Milk' eggs' bread.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|If you need a free alarm clock, this is it. Easy to use, great features, and it's free!!! This was the first app I put on my Kindle!
B00CQTKGY8|5.0|I got a white edition for Xmas. Was intending on using it on my Cessna on our many flight to Baja.<br />Sat in the box until with the help and tips from this book we got er going.<br />Have some great shots from the mount on the wheel fairing of the plane.<br />Highly recommended!
B0087EACJK|5.0|My 10 year old son has to help me play this game because it makes you think outside the box.  This is a great game.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|bought it for my mom for a birth day press and she really loved it it is one of her most liked shows
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is perfect. I would reccomend it to anybody! just takes a wee bit of skill in the hands
B003QTWR08|5.0|From beginning to end, a heartfelt and funny adventure from earth to the stars. It came out in 2008 and became one of all time favorites
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Steven Erikson made me realize how tired I am of the protagonist build up in so many other books.<br />This is refreshing and incredibly gripping at the same time.<br /><br />Wow
B0049J3RBC|5.0|Pixar is a studio that makes automatic watches. Of all the films they make, I've disliked about two. Their batting average is incredible. Ratatouille is amongst their best. If you're used to Pixar movies having a moment or two that just rips your heart out, know  that Ratatouille doesn't really have those. It's very light-hearted movie. Lots of fun throughout
B008Q0D32S|1.0|I couldn't stay with it to see what happened. It was like watching paint dry. Painfully slow. Didn't like it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I was hesitant at first, however after a few episodes I was hooked. There are a lot of end of civilized world shows and movies out so I thought it would be another cheap show tagging on the bandwagon; needless to say I was quite surprised and even excited when it turned out to be otherwise.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|Bill and Scarlett bring the best out in each other with these quirky characters.  The supporting cast adds a tremendous depth without overshadowing the strong performances of the headliners.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So engrossing! I was locked into this thought provoking app from the moment I first stepped into The Room and I did not want to leave! Every 'walk' around that box, every tap, rap, click and slide was a mindful exercise that I want more of. The graphics are beautifully done; the audio is eerily comforting; and every step in the progression of this puzzle is so wonderfully laid out. I was puzzled for just the right amount of time before the \\"aha!\\" moments that eventually dawned (often via helpful hints). I cannot wait until Fireproof Games opens another challenging room to explore. Kudos, FG; you are many intriguing steps above the rest! More, please!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It's a great movie to watch with mom, makes you realize you have a lot more in common than you realize. very heart warming film, I was happily surprised.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|If you like the ds versions i highly recommend this game for only 99 cents you get a whole lot of game and its just as fun as the ds version except better with a bigger screen if you have a tablet!
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Loved this book if you are a fan of either ian m banks books or good sci fi you should get in it ASAP
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Jack reacher is a hero that has integrity but believes the ends justify the means. Cruise is not my favorite actor but in this he does a good job. this is worth the time.
B008KWTF2O|5.0|I never knew that it's not good to comb or brush curly hair! That's why my hair looks frizzy all the time!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Minecraft is a popular game with kids, and if they also enjoy Legos, this is a win- win situation. My 8 year old grandson couldn't wait to put this together! He loved it.
B00886XQO0|3.0|It is a good headset but way over priced as all the headset are.  They know they have you over a barrell and they are going to give it to you and make you like it.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|There has to be another book soon.  What an ending. We know there are good guys and bad but the Martinez' outdid themselves. Towards the end of the book it kind of got sloppy until the very end. We know the Barringtons are good people but they don't deserve this is it really is true.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was a good movie, a little predictable though. All in all it was a suspensefull movie. Would recommend it to anyone that likes action movies
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I always love Nelson DeMille's books. Due to that fact, I hung in and finished it. For the first time ever, it started very slowly for me. Until Corey, Kate and Brenner actually went out after The Panther, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. Unlike the many other Demille books that I have read, this one, took way to long to get to the denouement. When I finally finished it, I was definitely not sorry that I had read it. John Corey, his wife, Kate and Paul Brenner are never characters that disappoint. I enjoy more action in DeMille books than this one offered.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|Lots of action and filled with a lot of action. It kept you in suspense. Would recommend this movie to anyone who likes lots of action
B001N3GUIE|5.0|What can i say about this classic besides Breath taking and ground breaking. The effects and acting remain relevant decades after it was released.
B00CI21EBC|5.0|This is an album for fans of the Heavies who want sophisticated dance music that is uplifting and well written/sung. It's as if the Heavies have heard that there is a core of music lovers who are desperate for those that do progressive music right. A seriously welcome British attack.
B000GPIPSS|3.0|This set contains two movies-the 1931 Bela Lugosi version and the Spanish language version filmed at the same time.  I know that the Bela Lugosi version is considered to be a classic and cannot be critized.  I beg to differ.  It Stinks.  Lugosi gives a performance that made his career.  The rest of the cast could have stayed home.  The script is mediocre.  However, the Spanish language version is much better.  It also runs about 50% longer than the English language version-more meat on the script.  In other words, buy this DVD for The 4 star Spanish version.
B002ZG976U|5.0|i bought this movie after i watch it from Netflix.<br />if i like a movie from netflix then i will buy it.<br />i have watch it about 2 time now.<br />joy
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Argo begins well. A brief history, depicted graphic-novel style, reveals how the CIA managed to undermine the will of the people of Iran and install the Shah as a greedy despot. The rest of the film serves to contradict this position as the CIA is made virtuous, and the Iranian people are portrayed as a nation of bumbling evil-doers.<br /><br />Argo never quite figures out what it wants to do - besides make money, and make Ben Affleck look gorgeous amidst a sea of 70s dorkiness and bad hairdos. If you are looking to waste a Saturday night with a mashup of trite Hollywood fodder, Argo may satisfy you. If, on the other hand, you seek a political thriller, stay far away from this phony movie about a phony movie.
B00846WWVM|1.0|I truly regret this purchase.  This was a total waste.  Don't spend your money or time on this lame game.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Unit is perfect, i was scared of buying a replacement one because i have had a lot of bad experiences with other units, where the replacement ends up burning up my batteries, but this is meant to be.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a really fun game to play especially with the ads gone. I would recommend this game to all ages. i'm a great grandmother, I play it and so does my son,grandson & my 4 year old great grandson
B00632HWOG|4.0|I have always liked my email with them and now I can get it on my Kindle.  That is very helpful.  I apprciate the ability to do that.
1582701709|1.0|If there has ever been a more pretentious book about knowing the path to happiness, then we have found a winner. The author offers nothing concrete in terms of fulfilling your own path. The idea of imagining positive aspects is definitely a good idea, but nothing new. This books offers nothing and whatever it does, is very superficial. If you want a book that will change your life, then you must look into Dan Millman's Way of the Peaceful Warrior or Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist.
B008X8RSTM|4.0|I have just looked it over but at some checking around I believe it is going to do what I was looking for.  I like the graphics and you can get maps for all over the USA and  other countries I believe as well.  It appears easy enough to use.  I am glad I have it and think it will help me if I get confused about where I am or how to get where I am going.
0316044695|5.0|Ok all kidding aside, who gave this 1 star? Those tabless babies with no stones that love to say things in these blogs because they don't have to look the author in the eye. They don't know what really happened because they weren't there. What some of these people have said is slanderous. You shouldn't say everything you think, yes your precious freedom of speech has it's limits.
B005HED11Y|4.0|Seen a few episodes a long time ago but good to see them again and in order.<br />Really like Amazon's Prime membership that allows for watching these and that they do not &#34;expire&#34; before I get a chance to watch them.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Safe haven was such a great movie! I was able to watch it twice. Suitable for teens also. Great cast and if you've seen The Notebook and liked it, you will like this movie also.
B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|The Last Stand(released Jan/13)stars,among others,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Forest Whitaker,Johnny Knoxville,Peter Stormare,Rodrigo Santoro,Eduardo Noriega and Luis Guzman.This film marks Arnold's return to movie making on his own.It has a good supporting cast and the action comes hard and heavy and often.<br />The story finds an ex L.A.policeman(Arnold) playing sheriff in a small town by the name of Somerton Junction,Az.The other concurrent plot running is an escaped cartel member by the name of Cortez(Noriega)trying desperately to get across the border into Mexico.His escape from the FBI was quite daring and well planned,and he has seemingly thought of everything and paid handsomely to see that it is followed through.<br />When Arnold and his deputies find a murdered farmer just outside of Somerton,they investigate further and accidentally stumble upon a group of hired thugs building a temporary bridge across a canyon that separate Arizona from Mexico.In the firefight that ensues one of Arnold's deputies gets killed.In the meantime the head of the FBI unit trying to nab the suspect(Whittaker)re-routes personnel to Somerton upon learning of the goings on there.His men never reach Somerton as they're killed before they ever reach it by Cortez in his high powered car.<br />It all comes down to Arnold,two of his deputies left and two friends whom he deputises.This is the titled\\"last stand\\" and Arnold and the crew make use of every vehicle and bullet they can scrounge up.The first to arrive is the thugs they first encountered building the bridge.Over a half dozen arrive and start shooting everything in sight.Arnold comes back with an old vintage machine gun and the game,as they say,is on.Shot is traded for shot and a lot of folks get killed,but Arnold and company stand fast.Just as they have that situation under control,in zooms Cortez in his car and Arnold takes off in pursuit.As Cortez tries to head for the bridge Arnold forces him off the road and into a corn field.After a hectic chase there both end up crashing into a parked farmer's combine.After the dust clears Cortex hops it for the bridge.As he arrives who should be standing in the middle but Arnie,of course.Cortez tries to buy him off but Arnold is having none of it.They wrestle and punch,and punch and wrestle and Arnold of course is victorious,as he walks/pulls Cortez behind his car all the way back into town.The town is saved,new friendships are born and Arnold lives to sheriff another day.<br />The film starts off a little slow as it introduces the two ultimately diverging plots but eventually the movies gets its legs and things start to slowly but surely get hot and heavy.The action ebbs and flows throughout the film and helps keep the picture on the beam.Arnold is certainly showing his age and has gained some pounds around the middle,but he still has what it takes.I should mention a scene in the film that shows all too briefly Arnold's acting ability.It is where his deputy is rushed to the hospital,but as soon as Arnold opens up the back seat he broken heartedly says\\"Johnny\\".We don't even have to see Johnny to know what has happened.The tone of his voice combined with his sincere look is one of the few moments that I can say I have seen Arnold REALLY act in a dramatic fashion.It was quite touching.Also it is nice to finally see good old supporting actor Luis Guzman make it through a movie and not get killed within the first 30 minutes.He WAS wounded but he did pull through.Peter Stormare does what he does best as the real bad guy in this film.And Johnny Knoxville,a gun freak,becomes becomes Arnold's Joxer to his Xena.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras abound with four featurettes,commentary and extended and deleted scenes.<br />All in all The Last Stand marks a good return to Arnold's native land of action,in a good film chock full of fights,car chases and lots and lots of gun fighting.Arnold even gets to stretch and use some of those long dormant acting chops of his.Worth a look,or two or three. Recommended.3 1/2 stars.h and use some of those long dormant acting chops of his.Worth a look,or two or three. Recommended.3 1/2 stars.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|I'll be straight forward: I loved the movie Beautiful Creatures.  I've read the whole series of books - and while the movie is very different from the book, the movie is an enjoyable and utterly gorgeous affair; the sets and effects turned what could have been a \\"Twilight with Witches\\" story into something significantly more beautiful.  With all that said - the movie suffers on some plot points that are clearer in the book and entire characters/subplots/etc. were thrown out completely.  The end result is that the movie ends on a bit of a cliff-hanger, but it's one that is unlikely to be resolved: they changed the story enough in this movie to make any sequel almost impossible to complete.  Even in spite of this, the movie is totally worth watching - and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the score.  I'd never heard of Thenewno2, Dhani Harrison's (as in George \\"I'm a Beatle\\" Harrison's son) band, but the score is absolutely beautiful - it's easy to listen to by itself while making the movie even more enjoyable.  I can only hope we hear more from them in this vein.<br /><br />Over all, with a few qualifications, I highly recommend Beautiful Creatures - the movie, the score, and the books as well.
B004DHAC04|5.0|The story presents an interesting conflict and resolution. It is best for older children and adults not because of objectionable material but for the apprehension of the conflicts of war and of true courage.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book was way better than the movie, which is usually the case.  I enjoyed reading this book and the characters were very likeable.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This season was better than I had previously expected. Yet again, I walked away surprised at the evolution of the main character, as well as his supporting cast. A riveting story line, and some extraordinary acting, this series has yet to disappoint.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This seems like a very nice app, only I don't know how to use it and trying to get my alarm to work, and I just don't hear it or maybe I am a heavy sleeper. I found it a bit difficult to figure out so I remove it but it is nice for those able to figure it out. Like getting the right time that was my problem and getting my own music to play just don't get how to do it so I gave up. None the less it is very nice like the stroke to soften the brightness.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a great read not only of the character if both American and German pilots, but of the history of the air war.  The author went to great pains to gather records from archives and personal interviews to weave this story.<br /><br />It gave me a newfound respect for the bravery and gallantry of both the 8th Air Force and Luftwaffe airmen.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Not sure how I got tow of these, one title My alarm clock and Alarm clock but was not able to figure how to use it well so I had to delete it. The only reason was because needed instructions on how to get the right time, I never heard the alarm go off or maybe I over slept, wanted to use my own music to wake me but had no instructions to do this or maybe I am not figuring this out well. Its a nice app looks great and the sound choices (sounds) are nice) but sure wish I knew how to handle this maybe instructions in getting ones own music would be great. Otherwise, I think the seller did do a nice job.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I bought this game, and my daughter loved it, however, within the game you can buy things, and there is no parental block or anything, my daughter bought $11 worth of stuff before I realized it.  Luckily amazon refunded the money.  There is a way to put up parental blocks, but those should be automatic.  My one click buying is off, and that should have covered this instance.
193700788X|1.0|After reading the entire sookie series (except this last book) I was excited to see how it would end. But then all the reviews started coming in and I decided then and there not to read or purchase the last book. CH should be ashamed of herself not only for the poorly written book she let be published but for calling her readers entitled because 99% of us do not like how the final book was written, matter of fact the last 3-4. READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS!!!! I did and you all are the reason I will NOT spend my $ on this book. To those who did I am so very sorry you wasted your money.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I absolutely loved this app and got it a while ago from FAOTD. HOWEVER, a week or so after having it the &quot;update&quot; changed it back to the free edition. I love lucking out amd finding an awesome app for free and I enjoyed this one so much I would have paid for it had this not been done by devs. Overall this app is brilliant but if they do what dis last time your full app will be free edotion within the week. Sorry devs for talking negative but I think these actions are shady
B000055Y0X|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie! Slim Pickins is awesome, as usual. &#34;One Russian Bible and phrase book.... one .45 Caliber semi-automatic... and of course riding the bomb down.. YYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeHAW
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I love this series very much. I have watched it more than once and have the whole series. Love it very much.
0783231032|5.0|Slim Picking is awesome in this movie, I love his acting and will be looking for more in the future
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just got my husband a Nexus 7 for our anniversary and he has started to read more everyday. Especially likes the books that deal with military/CIA/FBI. He has a few autobiographies downloaded in the week that he has this app and is very happy with it.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Yeah it has some funny parts, that's to be expected.  But as an over all film, it is way too long, and it's all over the place, with a bunch of extra story arcs that do nothing for the overall story.  I was disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is an awesome book loved all three of them, going to read it again and probably again trying to get friend s to read
1616550414|5.0|I have been waiting for this for what seems like forever. I ordered both the English and Japanese one on the same day. Thank you.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Not one song that i dislike! humming the songs all the time. All I have been listening to in the car on my way to work and on my way home since i bought it. Gets me pumped up and in a fantastic mood!
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|I was never a huge fall out boy fan. I probably like a couple songs from each album. So I assumed the same would be true with this one. But when I first heard Save Rock and Roll, I was surprised with how much I ended up loving it. Its an amazing album from beginning to end. I highly recommend getting it!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Anybody who likes the more classic rock sound will love this! I'm a huge fan of David Bowie so there wasn't going to be anyway this cd let me down.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I first saw this movie as a rental with my daughter but we fell in love with it.<br />It was creative and imaginative for children.<br /><br />I give this a 5 star rating because is beautifully created and love his work and collection.<br />I recommend this movie to any parents or children who have an imagination.<br />Its also funny and cute.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I am part of a three-man crew that runs a streaming radio program.  This is perfect for splitting the signal to our headsets, and providing the in-studio monitor<br /><br />Recommended it in my RL job for remote web conferencing where each person will have a separate headset, and they will use a conference mic to respond.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|This was a good movie. Not as funny as advertised but a decent story and Barbara Streisand is always great.
B00499NHLC|4.0|What?  Sherlock?<br />Very interesting story line.  production and video very good.  interesting to watch.  a good diversion for some entertainment
B009R659L8|3.0|I have read many of Mary Higgins Clare's books.  This is not even close to her best.  It's probably my least favorite.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Totemo HD is a simple game and I've liked playing it. I would recommend you try it if you want to kill some time.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Lee Child wrote the Reacher character as a 6 foot 5 inch giant with blonde hair.  Even though Tom Cruise is no more that 5'7&#34;, he pulled off the nature and persona of Reacher beautifully.  You can see Lee Child in the film as the policeman sitting at the desk in the police station.  He has no lines, just a shrug, but it was interesting to have him sitting because Lee Child is 6'5&#34; or so and he would tower over Cruise.<br /><br />Many Reacher fans (nobody calls him Jack) were very upset in forums that a taller actor was not used for the part.  I am sure that Lee Child was thrilled to get a top shelf actor like Tom Cruise to play the part.  If he was played by someone like Howie Long (one of Lee Child's early preferences), there would not be enough star power.  This makes it likely that there will be more films made with Tom Cruise having a recurring role in the movies as he gets older.<br /><br />The movie is very well done, keeping in mind that several characters were consolidated into one and a change in venue was made.  The book &#34;One Shot&#34; did not take place in Pittsburgh PA and there were several characters that were left out to shorten the film duration.  Even so, the film did a good job of telling the story and capturing the confidence of Reacher, that some would describe as arrogance.<br /><br />I am happy to have this movie on Blu-ray so that I can watch it again and again, just as I have read more than a dozen Reacher books multiple times.  Lee Child is my favorite author. I look forward to more Jack Reacher movies with Mr. Cruise playing the lead role.  I hope it has the same success as Albert Broccoli's James Bond series.  It took 3 James Bond movies before it became a sensation.  The same will happen with the Jack Reacher series to come.
0007466064|4.0|I liked this book the least of the 5 in the series because I missed some important characters.  I hope he brings them back in the 6th book.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This app is simple and it provides just the organizational capacity I need for an electronic notebook.  It makes it much easier to keep multile lists and ideas in one place and easily accesible.
B00338QENI|5.0|I have a medical background but never heard of HeLa until this book.  Amazing history, not only from a medical slant, but from a socioeconomic view point as well.  Advances in medicine would not have progressed in history at the rate it did with out her.  Not having medical coverage to care for herself and her family is a crime against humanity.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I don't like the quality of sound. First time i purchased the battery didn't work, so right now I use it tethered to an external usb battery. Pretty bad thing. The new one I have have a poor quality sound when volume is turned on.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Not my favorite but kept me occupied on my flight to mexico.  Barbara's character was annoying.<br />See it if you are bored with nothing else to do
B008JFLWLE|4.0|Very handy and fun and it is free and it is free and it is free and it is free. Why is there some min. words to rate?
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch.  Anything Johnny Depp is a part of is usually very good.  I liked the animation and the various characters.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Very easy to use.<br />Has large function keys for ease of viewing.<br />I like that it shows what was entered so you can correct with ease.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Safe Haven is very engaging. I enjoyed the movie, it really kept me on the edge of my seat! I also cried a lot, there are some very touching parts!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I deleted it from my device.  I could not access my calendar on it, so it was of no use to me.  I stuck with just accessing with my browser.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and play it every day I cant change anything it is great Iove the missions I wish we aren't so persuaded to buy stuff Is intimidating
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My 3 yr old son loves it...my 10 yr old says its good ... keeps you entertained for sure. good driving game.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|I found the book hard to read. The first half of the book boring and confusing. I was not very impressed with the story with how it was written. Checking out movie next to see if any better than the book.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Its a lil difficult...trying to land correctly...a lil weird how u land wrong and upside down how it u are smashing the dude in car & neck all tweeked back.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like this app. I have a question though, I received a notice of an update. How do I get it?
