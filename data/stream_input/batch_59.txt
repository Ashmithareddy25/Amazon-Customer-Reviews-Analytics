B00FAPF5U0|5|easy and fun. but not too easy. pretty graphics make it an enjoyable time waster. i just cant stop playing :-)
B00BB67UNW|4|Full of action, twists & turns in the plot, great action.
B005KDJCE2|4|ok
0307010856|1|I was so excited to receive this book for my son. I ordered it; even though the shipping cost was the same amount as the book! When I finally received this in the mail; I opened up the package and was hit with an awful odor! The book reeked like rotten fish and the pages were stained with a brown liquid. I checked the box to see if it occurred during shipping, but the box was in excellent condition.
B000002L7Y|5|I really like the 1st song, Take on Me. I would recommend this CD to everyone who likes a beaty song! Everyone I know likes it!
B004SIP8W0|5|I had no idea it would even be possible to make a film that dealt with the Holocost with a sense of humor, but Benigni does it.  A story of love, family and sacrifice through the lens of WWII, specifically the concentration camps.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has never seen a foreign language film.  It will certainly be a pleasent surprise.
B00OKYQZDI|5|:) awesome I love it!
1401937519|5|Fascinating to say the least.  I have always been a believer in life after death, and Moorjani's story simply solififies my beliefs.<br />The question and answer section at the end is very interesting and informative.  An excellent book, well written, & believable.
B004Y1WCDE|5|Everything you need for local streaming your media. Fast and without problems connected on my local server and works in 5 minutes.
B00W3V83QW|3|I have only played a few times, so really can't rate it properly.
B004DLPXAO|5|Actually since I have changed phones I can't seem to change my settings to have the books transferred to my new phone BUT with saying that I also send my books to my tablet which I LOVE the ability to transfer my books to my tablet as reading on my tablet is so much easier for me now with my being older.<br /><br />Keep it up Amazon, I love you!
B004P8JPS6|5|This book was hard to put down. Finished it in less than twenty four hours. Can't wait to read the next one!  Jack Reacher is a great character....please keep them coming as fast as you can write. Thank you, Lee Child!
B008HJGPVO|5|Great
B008SAZHLQ|3|It was a nice easy read, nothing to special about it.
0679311718|5|Dallaire's book is a powerful call to action that damns the so called civilised world for its failure to act in the face of Rwanda'a genocide.  Dallaire and his companions stand out as rare beacons of light amongst those who refused to act to save Rwanda.<BR>It was a heart wrenching book to read, because it becomes clear that the genocide could have been stopped, but none of the so-called great powers cared, because they did not feel that Rwanda was worth saving.  As Dallaire quotes the American officer, it would take 85000 Rwandan deaths to justify the death of an American soldier, whereas in Iraq, it takes only the US's desire for cheap gas for their SUVs to justify the death of American soldiers.<BR>Dallaire's brutally honest accout of his ongoing struggle with his inner demons that are legacy of his service in Rwanda, only increase my admiration for him.  For me, he is a true hero and a true soldier in a time when so many people in uniform are more politician than soldier such as Lewis MacKenzie.<BR>Dallaire is a model for us to follow, so that humanity will not fail again, I can only that we can live up to his, and the others who served under his command, example.  As I read of the courage of his troops, especially the Ghanaians and the Tunisians and especially the example of colonel &quot;Tiko&quot; Tikola, I was reminded that courage is not limited to the First world, yet we hear so little about their bravery.<BR>Read this book, and confront the truth that we failed the people of Rwanda, and we continually to fail the people of this world and we must accept our responsibilty for the structures of this world that helped to create Rwanda and the other killing places of this world.<BR>God bless you, Romeo Dallaire, for me you personify what Jesus shares with us in the beautitudes:-<BR>&quot;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God&quot;
B0013BNY2Q|4|Coupla days ago, REM released their new album! Without any fanfare that I noticed. I checked their website as recently as two weeks ago. Out of the blue they suddenly showed up on the Colbert Report! Well, REM is my favorite band, so I was thrilled. I own all of their stuff, even career nadirs like Around the Sun and Up. I was practically holding my breath yesterday, just waiting to get off work. Not only is the sound harder-rockin', it has received some critical acclaim! Not to mention it's currently #1 in Amazon Music! W00t! REM!!! Ahem.     Okay, so what does the CD actually sound like? It's harder rockin,' that's for sure. Not since Monster has REM released such a straight-ahead, pick-to-the-business, fast-paced, rock album. The funny thing is, most of the frills that were woven into Monster are mostly gone. Here and there, some shimmering guitar work, but it mostly just sounds like another Rock Record. I've only listened to it a few times so far, but the album basically sounds very concise. Like, quickly done. Like, accelerated. They've said in the past that Life's Rich Pageant was written in something like two weeks, and I don't have any problem believing similar for this album. But whereas LRP explored various song structures, and weird themes, Accelerate mostly just sounds rockin.' This isn't really bad, but it's somewhat disappointing. Not as disappointing as say, Around the Sun, which had a very snoozy feel.     In comparison to other REM albums, it sort of reminds me of Green. Not that many tracks, couple of obvious singles, here and there some politics. Of course, Green came just before OoT, AftP, M, and NAiHF, a series of true brilliance. I can only hope this is the beginning of another zenith for REM. The other problem with the album is its length. At around 35 minutes, it's among the shortest records they've ever done. Trimmed the fat, obviously. I haven't really looked up from my terminal in a while, but I imagine the music industry has changed a lotin the last 10 years, so maybe this is an effort to appeal to a newer audience. Here's hoping they succeed.    EDIT: Some guy named Michael just won 8 gold medals. Quell Coincedance, ne?
B00CRWJ5GO|1|I took a business trip and downloaded Cloud Atlas for my wife to watch on the trip.  When she tried to watch it, it was messed up with tiling, and stops and gos.
B00881VLCE|5|Love it!
B005GY0Y8S|1|I couldn't even finish it, very trashy, weakly strung together nothing's , contrived, silly and meaningless. It seems unfortunate there are more of these books.
B009UX2YAC|5|i love this game it is so additive  and the fact that iti s free is awesome! i play it all the time
0525478817|5|I was alternating between crying my eyes out and laughing hysterically throughout the whole book. (Which, although disturbing to watch, makes this book the MOST ENGAGING READ ever.) If that wasn't enough, John Green is able to weave  words of wisdom that has the reader examining his/her own life. Yet the novel is still a truly realistic, raw story.  I'm ready to read it again even though I just finished it an hour ago!
078696555X|4|I got this after Christmas as it is something I've looked at it for years and years and played D&D when I was little.  We've played it three times since I got it and twice was with my 6 year old daughter...<br /><br />She loved it.  I loved it...  It is simple and could be boring for gamers who don't like to have chance play a role in the game... Good dice rolling is a bonus... :)  However, we liked and enjoyed traveling around killing monsters and getting treasures.<br /><br />Would recommend as a family game and casual friends' game especially those who like dragons / fantasy.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Crossy  Road  is so addictive . I can't  stop  playing  it.
B00SM3GSQC|4|Better than all the previous releases! Worth the upgrade!
B000002UAX|5|Still a classic -- groundbreaking then, but still challenges musicians to stretch and try new formats.
B00C33M2EE|5|Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys piano and cello music.<br />The Deluxe Edition with the CD/DVD combo is the best.
B00JAQJMJ0|5|Such a fascinating film! Have watched it twice since the first viewing and still seeing more things that I missed in the first time.
B00DYOOGYK|3|It's okay
B004478GNI|4|This was a gift and and seems to be as great as any other lego product. Directions are important and seems as though Lego should sell replacement pieces and leave direction on line in case you lose them
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is so fun and addictive.
B00APUYWYA|4|good movie.  We like the music, the cast were good also.  A family type of movie, entertaining for every one.
B00000JCB2|4|when this came out i had to have it but all good things get old but its nice to put in and listen every now and then
B00F56AZK4|3|This is very good for the mind and I like that. So I encourage you to get this and see how you like it.
B00JP5ONY0|3|This movie is all about the imagery and the backgrounds.  The characters are poorly developed and the plot is quite weak.  While I am happy I have the Blu-Ray copy for the amazing scenery, the movie itself was far too predictable and a failure in my eyes.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews and I am glad that others were able to go on an existential journey, but sadly for me that did not occur.  There are some light moments of humor, a brief moment or two of emotional movement, and the rest of the time is spent looking at the backdrops and seeing how much time is left in the film.<br /><br />It is worth watching just in case you are one of the lucky few to go on that journey, but if you are like me you will be at least satisfied with the visuals and the karaoke scene.<br /><br />Note:  With this being directed by Ben Stiller I got the distinct impression that he simply wanted to take a vacation to some remote locations.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Season 5 was intense and fantastic.
B003ZLV8T8|5|Very easy to watch, relaxing movie. Actors did a fantastic job. Highly recommend if you need to wind down :) Enjoy!
B00E1LT41K|5|Fun Show!
B006PZBRCY|2|not so much
B00K7C17QW|5|It's awesome game to play they only thing that suck about it is having to wait for energy
1881273156|5|My wife tried to get me to read this book soon after we got married. Being a guy, I didn't want to read some girly book about love though! O what a mistake! Nine years later, I had a change of heart and discovered that I had missed out on so much in the last nine years because I didn't understand the language my wife was speaking. If you want to be able to show your spouse that you love them and/or you are confused about why they don't seem to show you love, then read this book. It will open up a whole new world of understanding for you!
B007GCY8FS|5|Nail-biting tension, hundred mile per hour pace, more switchbacks than a primitive mountain road with some of the most like-able Reacher characters ever.
B00004U2GH|5|Relive this cd as if you were there. Just close your eyes and feel the electricty in the air it makes the hair on the back of your neck to stand on end. pure magic with Cash like you have never heard him before. Brilliant
B006BDHAX0|3|Fun to play but keeps crashing and doesn't save your progress when it happens. It's closed itself unexpectedly on every level but the first.
B0071XO8RA|5|To start off I read a lot of different types of books I purchase through Amazon Kindle for my Ipad and I am not a big fan of science fiction! But I loved this book(s) from the beginning and it only got better as I read more! I told friends and family about it while I was reading it! The whole story about the characters, Jule, Lukas and all the rest grabbed my attention and kept me reading!! I can't wait for the next book and hopefully more to follow!!
B008FPOIT6|5|A delightful tale that 's whimsical, intriguing and fast- paced. Characters sometimes border on being  caricatures, but nonetheless they are believable and add interest and richness  of the story. Google and in particular, one employee of this powerhouse of computing knowledge adds credence and excitement. I found my heart racing and fingers furiously turning pages to reach the conclusion.
B000008JUM|4|It's great to revisit R,H &B after more than 20yrs ago when I had it on cassette. I bought it for a friend in Australia who had never heard it before, despite his interest in Cole Porter and many of the artists who contributed to it. Surprised it wasn't on iTunes, but delighted to find it on Amazon. Fave tracks still Debbie Harry & Iggy Pop - well did u evah? And Kirsty McColl's version of Miss Otis Regrets... but really I like them all and still think these renditions of Porter's classics are definitive for a generation.
B00000DQWT|5|Pat Metheny has done it again, mastered another beautiful piece of music with his creativity. Great music to listen to while driving down the highway or sitting at home!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Very fun game, wish it was easier to get coins, even my 5 yr old plays it!  He loves it too!
B00M30V1YO|5|as described, complete satisfaction
1442339527|2|The examples given in the book are outdated.  The repetition of the same thing and issues s frustrating.  This book can be cut in half. The language the authors used suits the 40&#34;s. In short, it does not teach much, unless the reader is totally ignorant.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Well done period piece incorporating real historical events (e.g. WWI, Spanish Flu, the Titanic) in the story lines. Full of hidden treasures that jump out at people who know, such as a clever French phrase used under one's breath at the proper moment during dinner or talk about investing with some American investor by the name of Ponzi. Every episode is a delight in spite of some very tragic moments. Nice introduction to what it must have been like living in a class society.
B001KR9AP8|1|Ok. From reading the 5 star reviews, the listener could expect some house-wrecking beats, some hot singing, and lyrics worthy of a entertainer at the height of their creative powers.<br /><br />Prepare to be disappointed. Again. This CD doesn't live up to the hype. I kept wondering while listening what CD everyone, who gushed about it, was listening to.  There is no attempt to grow or mature into a potentially legendary entertainer on this CD. All you notice is the sounds of cash registers ringing all over the world as people queue up ten deep to buy this crap and gush about it later to everyone with ears.<br /><br />Don't waste your time looking for signature track, or swoon-worthy vocals as Beyonce has shown herself to be a vocalist incapable of singing ballads.  Her strength lies in up-tempo songs where she can do that rap-singing she has become famous for.  While that was enjoyable when she was a teenager; it is not something a married woman pushing thirty should be doing.<br /><br />So...I give up! In the future, I will lower my expectations where Beyonce is concerned.
B00FPGSPQU|4|good movie, but very similar to the other 2 movies.
B0063GORYU|5|Wonderful app. I have played over 200 games in 3 months. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys spider solitaire. only one complaint, and that's that the numbers on the Kindle Fire are digital-y and I know someone who has an pacer and the numbers are much nicer on that device.<br /><br />thank you mobilityWare!!!
B004MC8CA2|5|I love it! I take my kindle to church and its the best ever! a must have! get it! NOW!
B009VMN3RA|3|Very much a real story about the complex relationship of 2 very different people sad at times and Sachs has more of a forgiving nature then I could in similar circumstances
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Great video quality. Very pleased with my purchase. Can't wait for next episode! Very iPad friendly download. Would recommend to all!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I highly recommend season 3 for Downton fans!  It is the best so far and is Full of intrigue and drama.
B00005JSGK|5|great entertainment
B0088W4YTK|5|This is an awesome series that was cancelled way ahead of its time, but at least we got 5 good seasons
B00H5G4Y68|5|This is a very nice surprise. I had never heard of Jose Gonzalez and have become a fan of his after first listen. The music on the soundtrack by his band is almost as good. Saw the film after purchasing soundtrack. The music worked incredibly well with the film. I recommend both.
B00AB12TEI|5|This book is useful and I recommend it to all manager to read.
B0054JZC6E|4|its very good &amp; challenging set of games.  its very enjoyable for the family. i like it. a lil bit
B00CYFGCOW|5|Really a neat Toy, it's so cute, got it set up to one of our IPads, and it does all kinds of neat things
B00C7KXUOE|5|Great show.  I thought it would be another murder of the week show, but it is so much more than that.
B001Q1QF2O|5|This sophomore album by Lily was worth the wait although it took so long. The album is just like her first album minus the heavy beats and songs that could probably pass as party anthems that don't have much meaning. I am glad to see Lily Allen back and I thought she was on the verge of being a sophomore slump or a one hit album wonder in the United States like one of my other favorite UK artist Craig David. I kinda wish this album had at least one more song like maybe a remixed version of one of her hit songs on the album, which did on her first album with the song Smile. The album just left me wanting more music or a couple more songs.
B00IBZ5YKW|5|Read this book to my class of High School aged Sp Ed students. We had read Wonder first and the students loved both books!
B00GBCMW9S|5|There wasn't one song I didn't like from this album. Eminem is back again
B003DS9ECQ|5|Good family movie
0739375970|5|People often complain that the 4th and 5th books don't contain enough action and movement... but they more than make up for it in the evolution of the politics and characters of the world. While the 3rd book might have been a series of slaps to the face that leave you questioning what could happen next, A Dance with Dragons IS what happens next. More important characters are introduced, our understanding of the world is broadened and things that were only stories and riddles before start to be realized.
B009GLHF5C|5|After seeing the concert in Seattle in Los Angeles, I wish I had purchased the album before seeing the shows.  The first 10 times I listened to it, I didn't get past the first three tracks (Supremacy, Madness, and Panic Station).  Muse continues to put out quality music without getting stale or recycling old songs and sounds.  Amazing.
B006N0MLJO|4|Too complicated for the non tradesman. I can only figure out a few of the things it does and those things I really like. But I am not in the trades and I cannot figure out how to use much of what it seems capable of doing. I don't think the &#34;Help&#34; if particularly helpful and could stand a little revising. Give it try, you might be able to use it better than I can.
B005K17RU0|5|In my opinion is is the very best weather app around. Easy to track multiple locations. Easy to read and understand. Just a great piece of software.<br />  STARRIDER
B004T6IBNY|3|Not quite what I expected.
B00DQR26EC|4|Interesting game so far, need to play more to see how much I really like it, can't beat getting a game for free from Amazon.
B00BAXFECK|1|I read this book because Amazon cited it as the best book of the year.  I am not sure I will take their advice again.  While the story itself was engrossing and well developed, I found the stream of conscious meanderings tedious and truth be told, quite worthy of skipping pages at a time.  Need to be careful not to miss something important, though.  I think this book needed a different editor.  It was way too long and the story line was definitely not enhanced by its length.  I couldn't wait to finish it and do not recommend it as an enjoyable read.
B007IXWKUK|5|Loved this series!!!  A great love story, didn't want it to end.  Can't wait to see what she comes out with next.....
B0006GAO5Y|5|perpetually-rewatchable with such a fantastic message: the underdog with a heart of gold, who sees the good in everything (even in a frigid, garbage-strewn Philadelphia), finally going the distance, but being content with just having lasted through the battle with the ultimate opponent.  Man, I love this film.  Everything about it, from the filthiness of Rocky's Philadelphia, to the creepy characters Rocky interacts with (all strangely devoid of strong profanity -- anyone notice that?) to the touching romance between Rocky and Adrianne.<br />A great and timeless story, and very inspiring.
B00992CF6W|2|I don't like it because all you do is walk around and put blocks down its stupid and if you ask me you shouldn't buy its just a waist of money
B00910Y1OQ|5|Very fun very addictive.<br />I mean it. Really.
B000FCKGPC|3|Not enjoying this as much as book three.  There are soooooooo many names to remember and memory not my forte.  Maybe it's me and not Mr. Martin.<br />I do love the way he writes and describes things; almost feel like I'm there.<br />I think I'm going to have to re-read them. A friend has read them all at least 3 times and says he picks up things he missed each time.
B008MG1E4A|5|Awesome book. Wish we could get more info about what really goes on in this country.  Very well written piece.
B0041KBWIY|4|This was one of my favorite horror movies when I was younger.  Love it!
B00H83EV5W|5|Fantastic Movie!  One of my favorite movies of all time.  A great script, jaw-dropping visual effects, beautiful cinematography, and masterful editing.  Must Watch in 3D!
0743454529|5|This time, it has the different characters taking turns talking in this book ~~ instead of just one or two main characters. This time, Picoult takes you into the deepest parts of your souls and minds ~~ makes you search for the truth that lies within. She doesn't make it easy either. You may be the reader, but she is taking you on a journey that has happened to other people ~~ and makes you question, what would I do in this situation? <br />Anna was born to be her sister's perfect donor match. Kate has one of the worst forms of leukemia which often is fatal to its victims before the age of five. The issue starts with Anna when she is thirteen and asks to be legally free not to give up any more of her platelets, organs or marrow for her sister. This is how the story begins, with Anna. There is Sara and Brian, her parents who have been caught in this medical nightmare for years. There is Jesse, the girls' older brother who has been shoved aside because of Kate's illness. This is a fight for Kate's cure ~~ at the cost of severing family relationships. There is Campbell, the attorney who decided to take on Anna's case and Julia, a former love interest who is also appointed by the court to be Anna's guardian. Their voices entwined and weave a compelling story that keeps the reader hooked from the first page. It makes the reader question ~~ what would I do in Sara's shoes or Anna's shoes? Or what if ... it's a soul-searching novel. You cannot read this and walk away unscathed. It's impossible to read any of Picoult's books without stopping to think of what could be.<br />If you're looking for a light read, then do not read this book. In some ways, this is Picoult's darkest novel and in other ways, it is her most redeeming novel. She brings the truth out of the dark places and makes you face it. Then sometimes, there is redemption when you least expect it.<br />This is perhaps her finest novel. If you're a Picoult fan, don't be shy in getting this one.<br />5-14-04
B006UKFFE0|5|A masterpiece for first time entrepreneurs. This book combines Eric Ries and Steve Blank's theoretical knowledge and teaches you how to apply it using examples and giving you the insights for each step while building your business.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Fantastic book!
B00008LDPU|2|Pros<br />-Contains stories about why and how the Matrix was created<br />-Some episodes have nice animation<br />-Matrix, geeks, and some anime fans will enjoy it<br />Cons<br />-Most episodes have stupid looking animation<br />-Weird stories<br />-Slight nudity, even if it's a robot, and a lot of skimpy clothing (really PG-13?)<br />-Tried to be too symbolic and artistic<br />Overall, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Just rent it if you really curious to see it.
B000VBJEEG|3|And the gags become as stale as last weeks baggets as he trys to teach an idiot that can't boil water how to cook. The only saving of grace is Pixar's high quality CG that makes the movie visually appealing.
B006ZDU7QI|4|The only problem with this CD is that the Artist, who is very talented, has so many variations between the tracks you feel like you are listening to various artist CD. I understand creativity can be difficult to harness and I still enjoy all the sides of Goyte.
B00AFCEIB0|5|Priced right
0307744434|3|I was disappointed in this book because it came highly recommended to me by two friends, both of whom I trust (one works in publishing).<br /><br />The problems I had with this novel were two-fold:<br />(1) This was way too long at over 500 pages (in paperback), when I think it could have been told in 300.  I don't mind lengthy books if all of the pages have purpose, but I felt like this needed more serious editing to tighten it up.  I got bored waiting for things to happen.<br /><br />(2) The characters were flat.  In a 500-page book that focuses on two characters, I want to really love them and feel like I know them.  Unfortunately, in the Night Circus, I had a hard time relating to Celia especially.  I'm not sure if I liked her, and I can't imagine holding a conversation with her.  She should have been damaged by her father's abuse (right?), but seemed to just be nice and perfect, which was unrealistic to me.  Marco was easier to grasp because he had some flaws, but still not great.  My favorite character was Poppet, but she really didn't come into play until the second half of the book.  There were many, many additional characters who never fully developed - which would have been fine, had Celia and Marco been stronger.<br /><br />That being said, I did appreciate The Night Circus' unique plot.  I enjoyed the &#34;realistic&#34; fantasy world that Morgenstern created for us, and I think she is very creative.  I think with more practice, she could become a great storyteller.  The potential is there.  I just struggled with her first book.
B0099RFVXQ|5|This is an awesome movie, a good story, lots of action and awesome humor.  My favorite super hero movie of all time.
B007MB5OCE|5|This is a very humorous and interesting book. I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to everyonecwho likes reading fantasy.
B00AKEMHCA|5|Great game
B008JFUQ3O|5|Love Despicable ME 2. The minions are as cute and fun as ever. The minions totally make the movie. This movie was as good as the first.
0804161380|4|This was a gift for my son and he loved it! The only issue was that the bookmark was bent'. Minor issue
B004FHBO9K|4|Great vinyl sound. decent record. not one of my favs, but at $9.99 how could anyone resist?  Ten year anniversary double LP reissue on 180 gram vinyl for $9.99?  Yes please.
B007K3JCAE|5|I recently purchased this movie on a an impulse. I had seen it previously in theaters and with amazon supplying an instant video with purchase you cant pass it up. Its a movie that has a lot of nods toward the original stories or sherlock holmes. It is of course americanized to accommodate the viewers need for excitement to remain interested. The convincing cast with an action pact plot with subtle intellectual dialogue and remarks makes this a movie worth watching again and again. This movie aims to entertain and so it does.
B004TI1WME|5|Very nice calculator and being able to label each line on the tape is very handy at times.
B003ZUTVJS|5|Everyone in the world needs to watch this!  Claire Danes is outstanding -- I've heard Temple Grandin speak and I don't think I could tell the two of them apart.
B000NQRE9Q|5|Known as one of the greatest &#34;modern&#34; classic adventure series, this collection is a must have for all movie lovers!
B00KW274SM|5|Great movie.
B005CRQ4OW|2|Even though it was humorous I felt it wasn't over the top funny and at times was hard to keep reading it.  Also the print format appeared to be a gif and not actual text and it slowed my Kindle way down, especially when turning the pages.
B0017KIBAI|5|The 9 feet wire is a very nice touch, The buttons work perfect. The Color White makes the controller more distinct while playing in the dark. 10/10!
0446310786|5|Like many great work of literature, this one packs a lot into its opening passages. It begins, \\"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident.\\" Right off the bat we are made aware that we are about to read of  past events monumental enough to make the participants dwell on them decades later. There is the suggestion that there's more than meets the eye in what's about to unfold, so you'd better pay attention. And, there's the hint of violence in the mentioning of the broken arm. Was it really an accident? We'll have to read to find out.    Often it is said that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told through the eyes of a child. This is not strictly true. The narrator of the novel is the now-grown daughter of Atticus Finch, nicknamed \\"Scout\\" in her youth, recalling events from her childhood, albeit in extended passages evoking the point of view of her childhood. This seemingly simple device is a sophisticated one that allows the author a lot of freedom and power to tell the story. The younger Scout's disarming innocence serves as a vehicle for a more direct description of people and events -- after all, a child sees and hears well enough, but she doesn't understand -- allowing Lee to show rather than merely tell about people and events. And, when it suits the author, the adult Scout can address the reader more directly. This slight of hand with the point of view is, I believe, instrumental in creating a novel where the characters seem to come to life and leap off the pages. It's always a delight when writing so technically well-thought-out remains so easy to read. Small wonder that adults should love the book so much and urge middle school students to read it. It is an approachable masterpiece.    Some readers may complain that the novel takes its time getting around to what is considered its pivotal element, the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman. I cannot see how Lee could have possibly told her story otherwise. We start with the children, who make up their own games and stories and more or less invent their own world as much as possible. Then the adult world gradually intrudes on Scout, her brother Jem, and their peculiar friend Dill Harris. Without being immersed in the children's Eden first, we cannot really understand the point of view of the narrator, who is telling the tale of her loss of innocence.  Much is made of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD as an indictment of racism. Certainly an awareness of and sensitivity to racial injustice informs the novel throughout, but I think it is really a tale of paradise lost, which happens to be told in the setting of racial conflict. This is the source I think of the novel's melancholy universality, for regardless whether you grew up in Alabama or in Zimbabwe, there comes a time in your life when you realize that the world isn't a very nice place, but there are still some things worth fighting for, and it's often surprising and inspiring just who the real heroes turn out to be.
B00MNYTWMI|3|The graphics are okay. The search is always for the same items, so you get really good at remembering where they are fairly quickly. This makes the game quite easy. Okay for killing time if not too challenging.
B00AREIAI8|3|I think this app is great for all ages and creates a virtual world of horses where you can ride work and play.
B00M01J7Q0|5|Love this! Great all the time listening that isn't like all the pop out there.
B004W2UBYW|5|Three words:  Freakin' awesome story.  It is extremely well written and the story sucks you in.  I could not put this book down even if I tried.  I got the ebook and I did not realize how long it is.  You will be reading for a while!  Awesome book about an awesome individual (although it seems he was a bit of an ass) written by an awesome author.  I have been more inspired about this book than I have even been about any other book.
B005LAIHY0|2|I am sure its been said many time before, but this film is a visual feast, just don't pay attention to the script which is riddled with gaping potholes and poor character motivation.<br /><br />The trailer for the film is 5 stars. The film itself is an unfortunate letdown.
B00R8JVTC4|5|Super romantic ans sexy album!!!! Amazing work! Love it
0345803493|5|This was my favorite book of the series.  You get into more of the perplexities of the Mr.Grey and Ana relationship.
B00VRYCGLO|5|Challenging and have fun with the game.
B00HB8UWCU|3|Decent but wanted more. But overall a good  movie.general idea was pretty cool.  Ending was worth it though. See it
B00OMKEK64|5|Great sound and voices that make the world melt away.  So happy for them and wish they would come to the US for concerts.  I use this to relax and just enjoy their blending of voices.  Amazing to find this kind of talent these days.
B000002W9Q|5|Well, I adore music, lived in 5 countries, speak 3 lingos and used to do choregraphy 5 times a week for about 9 years and...as much as I love French songs, Italian opera and Hispanic Rumba, Dirty Dancing is a classic of gold quality too: American romance, and a beat to listen that is great from training to dancing even for driving! <br /> <br />Take it for what it is: a true timeless gem...
B00000I0XW|5|What Lovely voice - and the music of Andrew LLoyd Webber is so engaging.<br />Sarah Brightman's voice has such a sweet and pure timbre.  It is a pleasure to listen to this recording.
B00ESCJG1U|5|No idea how it works but it works great. Only downside is that it can end up lowering the resolution of some pictures. Still I think this is one of the best picture editors on the market. It has several options from as simple as changing contrast to adjusting sharpness. The best part, don't want to fiddle with a bunch of settings? No problem. Let the app do it for you automatically which 9 times out of 10 is better than anything I could do. Would certainly recommend.
B009LQKHIO|5|Very well written. Keep writing, your very talented! Readers...grab a warm cup of Joe and enjoy! I would read as many books as she writes!
B00CS74W0C|5|Oh my I absolutely loved it.  Can't wait for book 4.
B002SSUQFG|5|Watch can be worn with any outfit very versatile. Great price for an automatic watch. If you want a watch that isn't huge this is the one!
B00AF6MF9I|4|I find it is entertaining to a degree. My son is just happy collecting the coins. I would like to have better instructions. It is difficult to figure out all the nuances.
B009NPM5Y2|2|This was pretty hard to watch. If you love 80's hair metal and musicals but hate movies with good acting or plot, this was made for you and NO ONE ELSE.
B007XC9BSK|5|Great place to keep all the cute little cars so they don't get lost or stepped on. My Grandson thinks it is cool.
B000FA5TTW|2|I am stunned that a) this book found a publisher and b) that someone paid for the film rights.  The overly long and tedious story line had me resolving to simply put it down several times but I kept thinking that the next chapter would make it all worthwhile.  I was so very sadly mistaken.  I can certainly understand how people who have suffered an unbearble loss of a loved one would be drawn to the concepts of heaven on which this plot seems to rely so heavily.  However, the concept is not enough to support a storyline overburned with one-dimensional characters. Even when they showed promise, Ms. Sebold lacked the skill to develop them.  The ending seemed to me to be a sophomoric attempt to simply tie up the loose ends. I suspect Ms. Sebold received confirmation that some fool was negotiating for film rights.  It shouldn't be surprising that a reading publich lacking both teeth & spines should find pablum such as this so easy to swallow.
B005544TRQ|5|I love this show! The characters are believable and easy to love & hate. The outfits worn by Donna & Rachael are gorgeous!
1451695195|5|fascinating book in large part because it was written by a scientist with the back ground to know that it is real.
0446579939|5|Always like his books
B002N5N5M0|4|Yes, the rumors are true: John Lithgow is amazing as the main villian in this season. The biggest dissapointment to me was the conclusion, everything leading up to it though was amazing, but the finale (for the first time for me) was a letdown. The image in the finale was pretty upsetting too, I won't say anymore for those who haven't seen it yet. All that side, the acting was incredible, who could imagine JL as a cold-blooded killer? Well, anyone see Cliffhanger? Obviously, he had alot more development in this, and better script.
B00E00C70C|5|Awesome
B002VPE1WK|2|The backpack is great for holding most of the items I use with my camera but.......me being a big guy (6'-0 with broad shoulders) can barely get it on........and forget trying to fasten the chest belt. It would be great for a teenager but not great for an adult.
B000FC130E|3|I wouldn't want to live in this version of the world.  Too much like a nightmare.  But really enjoyed the characters, and understood the attraction.  Fun read, just keep a light on.
B000J3EEBY|5|I am a huge fan of Loreena McKennitt's and have most of her music. <br />I think the is the best yet. I particulary like \\"Never Ending Road\\" <br />because of the Uilleann Pipes. Also the wounderful sounds of \\"Penelope's <br />Song and \\"Beneath A \\"Phrygian Sky\\".She again has taken a versa from a <br />well known poet and put it to music, ie \\"The English Ladye And The Knight\\" <br />By Sir Walter Scott. <br />In my heart I hope Loreen does not take so long to give more of her talent <br />to her fans again, for I know we all thirst for more.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Great addition to Star Trek tradition
0307946711|2|I liked parts of this book, but as a whole, it was too long and too melodramatic for me.  My first reaction at the start was that I should probably put it down due to the seemingly romantic formula and protagonist Dexter's obnoxious behavior.  I should have followed my gut.    Nicholls is a really good writer.  He has a deceptively simple style with a very good flow.  But the book is just too long with too much heated drama.  Ok, Dexter's a bad boy, Emma's a cool girl and why can't they get together - over and over and over.    I'd recommend this as a beach read, but it's 200 pages too long (at about 430) for that.  I'm surprised Nick Hornby gave the book high marks.  Maybe friend or same publisher?  Similar styles but Hornby's funnier and either has a better editor or better self-editing sense.

B000BW7QWW|5|This is by far the best sci fi I've seen in quite a while.  It definely has some messages, but that adds to storyline rather than detracts from it.  Whedon doesn't try and beat you over the head with his viewpoint, in other words.  Great storyline, and both myself and my wife feel that the movie does a good job of banishing the 'pretty boy' main characters so often seen in cinema now.  The recycling of big name movie stars is getting old, hollywood.   <br />In rebuttal to Mr. Lambert's review, I will say this: the reavers WERE dirty people with torn clothes.  Did you not watch the movie?  Yes its all great to have the bad guys costing around 10,000+ dollars a piece for costume and wardrobe in a sci-fi film, but that wasn't the plot, was it?  Whedon did a more than excellent job with the budget he was given.  I would have liked more closeup shots of the 'monster characters' and their ships,  but given the budget that may have detracted from the movie more than added to it.  As it is, the quick running glances we see of the reavers allowed for you not to notice any flaws. <br />Thanks for reading, this film is a must see for sci-fi fans or movie goers alike.  I rented it, and now plan to buy this movie and quite possibly the series.  This definitely left me both intrigued and wanting more.  I even watched the commentary, which I have only done on one other film: fight club.  Folks, I watch ALOT of movies; that says something.
B000FCK65W|5|The author really takes you into the psyche of the characters.  It is a good, old-fashioned read.  I certainly recommend the book.
B001FB55LC|5|Great
B0067R0APK|1|please fix the broken maps that the update added, on galaxy s3, and then it will be a worthwhile app again.
B00LFG2UMO|5|A very dark and disturbing commentary on the impact of western imperialism on the world. Very well-developed characters, unbelievably excellent acting, and a tiny little bit of hope at the end. However, as much as I liked the movie, it;s incredibly brutal and is definitely not for the faint of heart - I personally had a hard time eating for a couple of days and experienced nausea and difficulty controlling my hands and legs immediately after watching it. I'd definitely warn away anyone who has trouble watching heavy violence take place, including at least one massacre scene and mentions of cannibalism. If you're up to it, though, this is a very powerful story from a wonderful director.
B0087JTAKW|3|good
B00HB62MC0|5|Ugly Love. Holy. Crap. If you could take a look at my heart right now, it would be a bloody, beaten, mess. BUT, it would still be whole. Thank you for that Colleen Hoover. I absolutely love the concept of this story. There really are SO many ugly sides to love. Are the beautiful moments enough to withstand the ugly ones? Miles has experienced the worst of the ugly, at only 18 years old. This is enough for him to put up every wall, shield and armour that he can, to protect himself from ever hurting like that again. As I read his POV from the past, I couldn't help but prepare myself for the worst. Even though I didn't know what happened, I had this overwhelming since of dread coming over me. This. Wasn't. Going. To. Be. Good. And, believe me, it was heartbreaking. Tate tries so hard to go along with Miles' rules, but there was never any hope of that happening. She sees past all that armour to the real man inside. I thought she was perfect for him. She still gets her heart stomped on, but there was no way around that with this story. This book had me intrigued. It had my mind going 100 miles an hour trying to figure it all out. All that time, it also made me feel........hope. This is as real and ugly as love can get. It is something that everyone should read. I don't know how much ugly love Colleen has experienced, but she sure knows how to write it. Must. Read.
B006KSAPV0|5|I always love Almodovar movies.  This is one of the movies where wardrobe is great and the story very interesting.

B0067Q42BY|5|Love everything about this game.It is so addicting! I could play for Hours on end..and I do!!Definably  worth you giving it a try!!So what are you waiting for????
B004JN1CW4|5|read all 3books in this series and am awaiting the movie version of The Maze Runner.  if u liked The Hunger Games books u Wil like these. also the Divergent series are a must read.
B00BLCHZC2|5|If you like action, adventure, and epic battles...this is for you. We happened upon Vikings by accident and are now hooked...Season 3 just won't get here fast enough!
B001FB4W0C|5|This is my most favourite show and this series didnt let me down. The boys just keep getting better. I am now hanging out for the next series. I hope I dont have to wait to long.
0345803485|5|This was a good trilogy  (I read all three) Although it was a bit unrealistic and some words were repetitively annoying, I still enjoyed reading it. It was quite ENTERTAINING!!!  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie and wonder what actor/actress will play Christian and Anastasia.  I'm also wondering how one movie will be made from 3 books.  I have read some positive and negative reviews, so my advice is to read the books for youself to see if you enjoy them.  There are at least 5000 reviews on amazon alone, so while everyone is writing reviews about the author, she is going to the bank as a result of the sales from these books.......Good for you E L James. :-)
B009LDD22U|2|I'm sure the Blu-Ray release will be as crisp and gorgeous as ever.<br /><br />But, and while all shows develop over the years, TBBT is:<br /><br />* relying more on a laugh track<br />* jokes, as are entire episodes are nowhere as consistent regarding quality/comedy<br />* characters like Stuart are moved to the foreground in the credits but the underlying story arc is quietly dropped<br />* seeing Howard's mother in one scene now renders a lot of jokes made in earlier seasons less funny because the visage we'd seen doesn't really match up<br />* Sheldon, early on in the season, defended Leonard when Penny or someone was whining (very atypical but interesting) and this was dropped as well<br />* Amy is more of a jerk<br />* the couples seem more like \\"Friends\\" as opposed to the nuances of the first three or so seasons<br />* no more cool bits like the \\"corn starch and water that makes it solid in response to the percussive response of a speaker\\"... not even cool games (just the dancing Star Wars game with the big OTT caricature heads that no nerd, much less anyone else, would ever play because it's so outrageously bad...)<br />* we're laughing more at the characters than with them - true, the show has always had a mix of this, but as ideas have been getting thing, finding ways to laugh AT them has taken prominence<br />* even in some episodes, the cast appear to be phoning in their performances - the spark of the earlier seasons is not there<br /><br />It's been a fun show, and I expect it to last to season 8 or 9, but it is going the way of other shows Lorre has helmed in the past - total and utter burnout.<br /><br />Someone once said \\"Always leave them wanting for more\\".  That was decades ago.  These days it's the M.O. to dilute the show and drag it out into the lions' den to be chewed to microscopic shreds.<br /><br />Seasons 1-3 are the glory days.<br /><br />4-5 are cruising.<br /><br />6 seems schizophrenic and all over the place and the proverbial sharks were spotted.<br /><br />Despite high ratings (which only mean that many people watched and arguably enjoyed the show), the show is heading downward.  Populism was never my thing; if millions of people tuned into a 'reality' show that got its kicks from hurting people in real life, it is still not necessarily a good or right thing.  But centuries before there was television there was slavery, and millions loved having slaves too.  Phew, glad times changed on that...  and that didn't come about due to a popularity populist voting contest...<br /><br />Never mind 10 or 11 minutes of really aggravating commercials during the episodes; how do modern viewers sit through being treated like an imbecile so constantly? (Seriously; how commercials are made to lure can be an indication of what the company thinks of the customers in the target market...  like the one company that has to tell you what your thumbs are for when touching the screen complete with circus clown music blaring in the background, for example...)
B001EBWIRW|5|If you don't have this movie in your library, you've got to add it!  There's endless comedy and Broadway songs that will stay with you forever.  I'm not kidding, you will be singing these songs!  Not to mention the cameos of actors Bill Murray and John Candy, which takes the hilarity to crying lol maximum!  This musical is a wonderful hour and a half of non-stop laughter!
6302779278|5|Kevin Costner stars as a stoic ex-FBI agent who becomes the bodyguard for rock diva/good Mom Whitney Houston. He finds her lifestyle a bit much at first, but thanks to her cute son, he starts to like her (a definite no-no in the bodyguarding business). Someone is trying to kill her and there are very some intense moments as the stalker gets very close. But who hired the killer? That's the real question.<br /><br />Whitney has a perfect voice and she sings many memorable songs. You'll rock to \\"Queen of the Night,\\" and could there be a more bittersweet lovesong than \\"I Will Always Love You\\"? Their one romantic encounter is much too brief, but the chemistry is palpable. He's icy, she's hot; what a combination. Costner and Whitney are very sexy and also quite vulnerable. Credit goes to the excellent script as well as the stars' talent. This is a real chick flick: it's got romance, action, suspense, music, and a two gorgeous stars.
B002VWNIEA|5|Great movies for a great price. Great addition to any collection.
B00AA0TJO8|5|l love how interactive this game is.
B009CPEOC4|4|I like Katy Perry's music, it is catchy and fun. However, I was pretty surprised to see someone who is so new on the music scene making a feature film about their career. But we were looking for something to watch the other night and this was one of the options, and my daughter picked it. I ended up really liking the movie! Katy Perry comes across as very down to earth and quirky, which is certainly someone I would rather my Daughter look up to than a Brittney Spears! She is talented, hardworking and really makes an effort for her fans and family which was nice to see. I recommend it!
030746363X|5|Me and my wife got this book 4 weeks ago. I started the \\"Lose 28 lbs in 30 days\\" as well as the triple your testosterone and sperm cound sections. In the last 2 weeks I have lost 9 lbs an 1 full inch off my waist. The food tastes wonderful and the diet is easy to stick with cause you are only on in for a week... then another week... so you don't notice. My Testosterone went from 300 to 402 in those 2 weeks and is climbing. The 15 minute female orgasim is insane!!!! my wife whom has never had an orgasim in her 30 year life is in love with this section. This book is so cheap but is filled with quite literaly life altering items... I now am losing weight like a fiend... lifting more.. running faster... getting my wife off and sleeping less while being less tired... ummmm where is the downside!
B000002JAX|1|Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better. Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy!
B00JPCCJFS|5|Ken Follett weaves a magical story into real life events like no one does.  The large number of characters are brilliantly managed over a lifetime of events. Impossible to put down once you begin.
B00LLQ28LQ|5|I loved this!! But then, I love anything with Anna Maxwell Martin, When I saw her in &#34;The Bletchley Circle&#34;, I was stunned. She has such a strong screen presence. It was also a lot of fun seeing what actor played each role - like seeing old friends whose lives have moved on. Really great acting! The story was fantastic. Very compelling. I watched it over 3 nights due to time factors, and it was hard to get out of my mind. I wish it was a series.
B00MIA0LDQ|5|Love it!
B004EWFUQY|5|I have tried every diet in the world.  At 50+ it's even harder to lose.  So far I have lost 12 pounds in 3 weeks and I haven't been hungry at all.  A must try....may end up being your new secret!
B00R2LTNL2|5|This movie....first off I enjoyed this movie because I like the story arch. But if you are looking for anything resembling the books, know that you left that back in the last movie, and even then its highly questionable. Just throw the books (which I have read and loved) out the window and enjoy this movie for what it is. Something completely made up.
B00GIZO674|5|4 words: best cooking game ever
B0001HLVS2|5|This film appears as a tribute to the days of the \\"Swashbucklers\\", a time when one could sit, literally fastened to their seats, in the excitement of pure entertainment. No headgame challenges, nothing to  opine about, enough historical fiction to actually reach the level of being thrilling. The lead actor had the charisma of both of the Fairbank's, Errol Flynn and Gregory Peck. It is a pity most of the films of those great actors are no longer available. For those of us who weary of the mind bending,sexually suggestive, violence for violences sake stuff that is foisted as \\"Adventure\\" nowadays, this was a film to which one could  bring ones family. Not an Oscar winner and maybe not even a colossal hit at the boxoffice but an honest to God good movie. I loved it and hope there will be a sequel.
0399226907|4|Bought because I rememberd from my childhood... that's a long time ago.  Bought for my grand kids.  They seem to enjoy the pictures.
B003XTYDMQ|4|The show kept me interested through each season.  I look forward to watching the movie.  Wish there were more shows like this.
B008JMKN4Y|4|Before reading this book, I read a lot of the reviews about it and there quite a few mixed reviews. Some people hated it, some loved it. The majority of the bad reviews were based on the fact that they didn't like the characters.<br /><br />For all intents and purposes, Travis is controlling. He isn't God's gift to women, more like God's gift to psychoanalysts. I get that people are outraged over his actions. I get that people were outraged by Abby's meek-will-keep-taking-his-crap attitude, especially in a world where we are attempting to raise independent strong willed women. As cliched as it sounds, maybe there is a love that can change people from confident independent individuals into blubbering, annoying needy, psychos. I have certainly never been in love like that and would immediately head for the hills if that type of love was bestowed upon me.<br /><br />With that being said I prefer to rate and review a book based upon the writing and the way the story makes me feel. Granted, I am a 33 year old adult woman and this is a book from the YA genre. When I read fiction it is for entertainment purposes and I guess I am past the age where what I read deeply influences my actions and decisions. So I accepted it for what it was, which is a work of fiction. I truly liked this book. I have no complaints about the author's writing, and she was really good at portraying the characters in a way that I felt like I knew them and was rooting for all to end well. Which... (SPOILER ALERT)... it does!!<br /><br />I am not prepared at all for my 13 year old daughter to read this, although she says her friends have, but for me, I enjoyed it. I do not, however, have a desire to read Travis' point of view in Walking Disaster, the follow up switcharoo to Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B005I6EU48|5|I love this cover. It makes this look like a classical book. Keeps the scratches off. I highly recommend this as a gift.
0062124293|1|THought this would be a much funnier book.  Didn't like the constant vulgarities.  Some may find it amusing and the interview on NPR left me feeling this was a very funny woman but the book was so bad I gave it to Bookman's after reading about 50 pages.
B009B8YZKS|5|Halo fans have long wanted Live adaptations of our favorite video game and Master Chief. This web series turned movie is extremely well done. I think it was even done in partnership with 343 industries and Bungie co founder Frank O'Conner, who strives to keep all the Halo games, books and other licensed media in line with the canon of Halo. This is also a great prequel to Halo 4. Looking forward to see what happens with the Halo TV series announced at E3 with Stephen Spilberg...
B0034G4P4Y|5|Great movie.  Upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray.  Big differance from dvd.  Picture quality as well as sound as amazing
B00KMX5V8G|5|This is a fun and challenging match game.  While there are IAPs available, I don't find them necessary.  When you run out of lives (for retries), they regenerate every 10 minutes (Max 5 lives).  Since I got it as a FAOTD, it's all good! I recommend this game app as a great time killer while commuting or other waits - then let it regenerate while you do what you are SUPPOSED to be doing! :-)
B00CHI5B7A|4|If you like movies thematically based around the mob, cops, or generally like action, then you'll probably find Gangster Squad to be an enjoyable experience. The premise involves a sanctioned but secret band of police officers who fight dirty to smash up a notorious and powerful gangster's seedy business. The whole adventure is actually inspired by a real life Gangster Squad whom you could guess probably were probably somewhat a little over exaggerated for this classic take on action feel. Also, this film is light on the drama, romance, and suspense but can be taken sincerely if you give it a chance.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the film and would watch it again, but I wouldn't count as a great movie. I'd really like to see everyone in this movie in more movies because I think they are all wonderfully skilled actors and actresses.
B00AEFXOKO|5|I enjoyed the book and think it teaches life lessons,  also teaches valuable lessons to teens.  Very enjoyable read for all!
B0000029DD|4|Buckley's interpretation of L. Cohen's Hallelujah is beyond the pale
B0058VW36U|5|I love this game, it's so much fun . It keeps you interested in the game. My opinion is that this game is fun and you should try it.
0143039504|5|I was looking for an edition of Austen's collected works that fit well in my hands, and this fits the bill. The pages are crisp, clean and the typeset is quite handsome (rather easy on the eyes). It isn't too heavy or bulky and the pages don't unknowingly flail out of place--causing you to lose your spot. For the layperson, the introduction is an added benefit, but if you're smart you'll just skip right to desert and dive into Austen.<br /><br />On a side note: My copy has been through quite the beating. Several cherry danishes were inadvertently smashed into the pages, a glass of water was spilled and to top it all off: I dragged it all around the Americas while traveling this summer. So, believe it or not--it still looks brand new.

030758836X|4|I'm not really a murder-mystery kind of girl, but this book was part of the curriculum in my Contemporary American Literature class.  I personally felt that the first half was pretty boring, which is why I only give the book 4 stars, but the last half was infinitely more interesting.  I lost sleep to finish this book.  Worth the read!
B0047Y0FGY|5|If you need (another) reason to love Tina Fey, read this book. It is a biography of sorts, told in short vignettes that are easily read. Definitely a book that will have you stifling your giggles as you read it at night, staying up way past your bedtime b/c you just want to read a few more pages. It does frankly (but not gratuitously) discuss sex and homosexuality. Besides adults I think it would be a good book for older teens, especially those that have had a hard time fitting in with the popular crowd. Enjoy!
B000B8QG4A|5|Great to do business with  !!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2|Really didn't care for this book and the attitude toward women. I would not recommend it to any of my friends.
B000QUCNOK|5|I liked the movie.<br />I appreciate the rather uniform high quality of the amazon reviews, it tells me that the movie stimulates people to think about the issues and consider what the authors present.<br />But i'm left with several lingering problems about what was going on.<br />Perhaps these things were settled in the novel and only hinted at in the movie, i don't know.<br /><br />Like any good piece of literature there are several threads interwoven.<br />The first is about obsession and talent. Here the movie reminds of Amadeus, just a different sense-this with smell and Amadeus with sound.<br />For Amadeus was about talent, like this movie what happens when talent is submerged in life and suppressed and not recognized for the rarity and genius that it is.<br />The main character, Frog (apparently one translation of his name and a striking description of the character and his walk as well), never has a chance. Despite being an olafactory genius, he is trapped in a time and place that only offers his talent meager usage. That is one of the questions i had, this main theme just gets dropped after the climax of the naked bodies in the square, he literally loses the obsession and the drive, i don't know why.<br /><br />As his uniquely talented nose is discovering the world and trying to find an outlet (which it eventually does with Dustin Hoffman's character, the failed Italian perfumer). The second theme begins to emerge, on top of the obsession is something about the essential things, the essence of being, the smell that characterizes. At first it looks like the author is talking about the soul, the thing that makes a woman a woman, a piece of steel-steel etc. but i am not sure. It looks as if this characteristic, this smell that he detects is the essence of being a woman, maybe love, maybe joy in living, maybe even pheromones of attraction and sensual passion. This is the whole thread about creating the perfect perfume from the distilled essence of the 12 (or is it 13?) beautiful, attractive, young women. It doesn't appear to be about sex, despite the orgy at the end where the townsfolk get a whiff of the finished product. Perhaps there is a hint in the three kinds of scents used in perfumes, one for immediate, one for intermediate, one for long term. In the long term, the townspeople were apparently embarrassed and ashamed, in the short term they were passionate and lustful. In any case, the perfume is about synergy, how the essence of these women together create the perfect perfume.<br /><br />Another major theme is about love and caring. The first half basically hasn't any love in it at all, the later half has the relationship of the father and daughter and them to the dead but not forgotten mother and wife. The Frog has no love or concern for anyone, his first murder is just circumstantial, an accident.The others are planned, calculating and cold blooded, none even with any passion or lust despite the hair shorn and naked bodies of the young victims. His only passion comes in a brief, what if vision he sees when he opens and uses the perfume in the town square. It's not as much regret for their deaths as a missed opportunity to smell them more intimately. But another thing that puzzles me is that the universe, that fate seems to follow him and tidy things up, everyone that passes him along, from birth mother, to orphanage exploiter, to perfumer, to 2nd perfumer, died comically tragic deaths soon after he moves on. It is as if the universe is balancing out the very rotten hand he was dealt, by dealing death to those that exploit him. But why? Because they didn't recognize and further the talented nose? No, it is more like cleaning house or tying up lose ends. Again, i'm not sure what the author is trying to tell us here.<br /><br />Even with these 3 themes doing a complex waltz on screen, the movie is a riot of color and proposed smells for us, the audience. Since our theaters don't have aerosols that bring specific smells to our minds, the smells are provoked by some extraordinarily good movie making. I for one can smell the sewers of later 16 or early 16thC Paris, i've been in Chinese fish markets and suspect that they smelled pretty much how the world into which he was thrust so unceremoniously did back then. This crossover of visual and olfactory senses is a treat, movies seldom work much on our sense of smell. Again the alignment with Amadeus pops up, just another sense. There is this nice crossover between sense and sensually, for smell is a key sense in sex and lust, something that the movie uses to heighten and strength the impact.<br /><br />It's an interesting movie, i'm glad i ran across it.aordinarily good movie making.

B00VFTCGES|5|Great movie, and I think the idea that the world could simply run out of food is absolutely something we should be thinking about.
B00G1J1D28|2|Was going to buy this eBook, but I noticed that it's $4 more expensive on my account than my friend's account. I disagree with the dirty tactic of dynamic pricing, so I won't purchase this book out of principal. The book itself looks good, but I'd rather not give money to something I disagree with.
B0064MGU98|5|This show has everything one would want!  Never watched before, now i'm hooked.  Been watching on my free Prime with purchase of my Kindle Fire - going to get a yearly subscription - Love Prime too!
B000FVQLRA|5|Five for the movie but one star for the product. Incredible movie first off Adrian Brody plays yet another amazing role. As for the dvd the last thirty minutes of the movie was unwatchable. Thin hairline scratches all over it, I am needless to say very displeased with the seller. Great flick though
0060254920|5|This is a childhood favorite of my son and daughter.  I had hoped my granddaughter would love it too-- but she is not into &#34;boy&#34; tales.  I love the book too much to even consider giving it away.  I have many good memories of reading the book to my children attached to it.  This hardcover version is everything I had hoped for.
B005GSVFBE|5|My daughter has all 3 movies, but we had to buy this because of the 3d and digital copy it comes with.
0061474355|5|There is something about this universe that draws you in and makes you want to know more. I love all of the symbolism in the bells and the gates in the river of death. I love all the action and adventure, you really feel like you're experiencing it for yourself. Most of all, I love these characters! They are relatable, deep, and interesting. There's not much I've read that I consider to be equal to the balance of fun, fantasy and incredible story Harry Potter has, but this fits the bill all day long. The only thing I don't like about the whole series is how there's not MORE!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazingly for a story about teens with cancer, I made me laugh out loud. Loved it.
B00HGJ18C2|4|I like this game. It helps me relax after work.
B003YHSE7W|4|Very, very good presentation of the movie.  I don't think it looked this good when I saw it in the theatre.  Crisp, sharp and clear (blu-ray player, HDMI cable into a 1080dpi television), there are times you feel like you could almost step through and join the movie.  Downey and Company do a fine job (if you can accept Samuel L Jackson being Nick Fury, my only complaint in the casting).  Loaded with extras, all well worth checking out and worth your time.  The seeds of the coming Thor, Captain America & Avengers movies are all here and better shown in the extras.  I really have no complaints about this movie other than I wanted more.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|A great movie for all ages,  really let me know the true story of Maleficent, we loved it!
B00ECU2SGS|4|Story developed around two young kids, a fugitive and girlfriend.  It shows the innocent of kids who try to help the fugitive.  Keep me stay in seat to want to know how the story changes in every hopeless moment. Enjoyable movie.
B008673ZAQ|3|Excellent novel similar to fifty shades of grey but has a much better story line. The author gets more in depth with the story line an characters and you don't want to put this book down
B003L77GG0|5|Smallville has been one of my favorie TV shows.<br />They did a fantastic job of bringing everything full<br />circle and tieing it all together.  What a fantastic ending!
B007ZGO7EM|4|It works.
B008Y7EYSK|2|Just a really slow movie

B0055S348W|1|that was $13 down the crapper..  doesn't work on 1st Gen Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;..  I wish I could get a credit
B00GRVV29E|4|Very cool app to play around with. Should add custom music and more &amp;#34;levels&amp;#34;. All around good app though.
B00AB7HESI|5|Lots of fun.  My granddaughter said she could play with this all day!  Of course, she is limited by her parents.
B000PXUA5W|1|The legos dont stay together. Cute idea though for those who like legos. Save your money and buy a different watch.

B0050CQY1W|1|You know, like I stated in my last album review with Beyonce, I used to LOVE this girl; when she was with DC, I used to want to be just like Beyonce and Letoya! I admired their beauty, grace, talent...and more importantly their modesty! Even when Bey first went solo, I was so excited to see  her doin her thang! Lol! But after \\"Dangerously In Love\\" I started to see changes in Beyonce; she became NARCISSISTIC, arrogant, dishonest, over-saturated, conniving, addicted to the attention, she became more revealing (as far as outfits), and her music started to take a turn for the worst; she abandoned the genre that she can prevail in---which is R&B--to make music that was ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! Overall, I started to see things about Beyonce that I did not like (especially the fact that DC was all a gimmick to get her popularity to a point where she could succeed as a solo artist). As much as I could go on FOREVER about the flaws in Beyonces' personality, my review is going to be about this album! As with all her albums, I have always tried to listen to each and every song with an open mind, but the more music she releases, the more she completely TURNS ME OFF as an artist! Before Beyonces' album was released, she stated that she actually wrote 72 songs! It baffles me that out of the 72 songs the supposedly \\"wrote,\\" this album were the songs that she selected as the best! Beyonce is a beautiful woman who has vocal abilities to be an AMAZING artist, but the fact that she hasn't (in my personal opinion) matured as an artist baffles me! Besides the fact that Beyonce has been in the music industry since '97, she is a MARRIED WOMAN! Not to say all her songs should be love ballads or of heartbreak, but songs such as \\"Run The World\\" just shows listeners like myself that she is not interested in showing her listeners that she has matured--it proves to me that she is not only fighting to stay relevant, but is not truly taking the time to write profound, deep, meaningful lyrics.     As much as I could analyze each song on the album,  I will just give a general opinion. I do not enjoy the \\"singing rap\\" that Beyonce seems to enjoy! The continuos hollering and the introduction of her using profanity quite frequently DOES NOT SHOW GROWTH! I really believe Beyonce really needs to either retire while she is on top (and has the most OVERLY-OBSESSED fans I have ever seen), OR SERIOUSLY take some time off from interviews, concerts, etc. and write some deep, sensual, ORIGINAL lyrics! I really wish stans would learn that their opinions keep Beyonce from growing and maturing the way she should; instead of continuously saying how great she is as a person, they should really learn to evaluate her music for what it's worth and provide an unbiased opinion! In other words, they should evaluate her music as if she wasn't Beyonce (if it was another artist singing the EXACT same song, would they still approve). To me, this is just another overrated FLOP! But then again....everyone is entitled to their own opinion!  I really believe if Beyonce were to take some YEARS off, have at least one child, and reflect on her years of over-saturating herself with terrible music, she would actually mature! Then again...I have always felt like since \\"BDay,\\" she is only remaining popular because she sells her cooch through her music. And if that wasn't the case, why is it 90% of the time, Beyonce is exposing her body? Just my opinion though.....

B00082IJ08|5|Damon Albarn achieved with Gorillaz what Blur never even grasped. In the future, Gorillaz will prove to be much more significant to music and modern culture than Albarn's main band. Demon Days is far better than the average albuns in the music industry. It is innovative, it is fresh and points to new directions as Danger Mouse and Damon Albarn freed their mind to give their minds inspiration - the benefits of a side project band! <br /> <br />One should get started in the Gorillaz world by their first album and then try Demon Days. That is the only way one can drilldown the amount of ambiencies and sounds in full. Songs like \\"Dare\\" and \\"Demon Days\\" demand more than one listening.  <br /> <br />Wish all Top Ten records were like these!
B003JUGQ38|5|David Tennant is Brilliant as the 10th Doctor, and Catherine Tate shines as Donna Noble.<br /><br />for those who don't know, this season introduces us to River Song and the Weeping Angels.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0036S4B6M|4|Not surprisingly, the book is quite different from the series, although it is interesting to see where the characters originated.  This book is more about what it means to be a woman in prison than it is about the characters themselves, and I'm sure that was done on purpose.  It's fine in the series to provide a background for the characters.  In fact, that's one of the best parts of the Netflix series.  In the book Kerman is careful to respect the privacy of the women she got to know, which is admirable, but it is also a bit frustrating as a reader, as it gives the book less depth than it otherwise could have.
B000002OMN|5|Meat Loaf at his all time best.
B00COGY2P2|5|Great flix, lots of Action
B007SGM084|5|I am so glad I bought all three books because as I finished book one I opened book 2 and kept going! Couldn't put these books down!
B000006TRV|5|This is arguably Floyd's greatest work, and is truly a legendary album.  Rumour has it that Roger Waters showed this work and The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking to the boys in Floyd at the same time, and the Floyd members decided to do this one (smart move).  It's an immensely complex work, which was probably lost on many who just loved the lyrics of Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2.  It's one of rock's most ambitious albums, and Waters and the band should be congratulated for that.  This is pretty much Waters's creation, with a few credits given to Gilmour, and one to the producer, Bob Ezrin.  Many people have trashed Waters as an egomaniac, but he is a great lyricist/songwriter.  His lyrics and songs are vastly superior to Gilmour's, and he came up with the great concepts for all of Floyd's classic albums.  However, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright did contribute greatly to the Floyd sound.  They may not have gotten credit all the time, but Pink Floyd really interpreted Waters's work very well.  Waters's solo albums aren't as good as his Floyd work, and this may have something to do with it.  The tour for this album was one of the most elaborate in rock history.  Gilmour, Mason, and Waters didn't get paid for their work here because they felt it was more important to put the show on in their original concept.  Ironically, Richard Wright, who was fired (or left) the group during the sessions for The Wall, was hired as a contract musician for the tour, and ended up being the only one of the group who made any money off the tour.  This was probably Floyd's last great album, even though The Final Cut is brilliant in its own right and Momentary has its moments (I don't have The Division Bell).  There are many great songs here, much of them better than Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2 (Mother, In the Flesh I and II, Waiting for the Worms, Goodbye Blue Sky, One of My Turns).  It isn't a happy album (despite success, Waters's songs got even darker as the years went on), but it's absolutely essential.s absolutely essential.
B008FYZIVY|5|Can't say enough about this wonderful series.  It is truly a gem and we look forward to more of it.
B001AFF25W|4|I think the puporse of these type of self-help books is to supply the reader with a simple philosophical approach to life that can be swiftly and easily implemented without taking a wrecking ball to your current lifestyle. Very few authors are successful at doing this.  Brian Tracy hits a homerun with this book. Sure, the book doesn't reveal some ancient secrets of productivity from some lost civilization of demigods (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars), but it does present various systems of approaching procrastination in a straightforward way. And you will see results. By setting priorities and eating your frogs you'll get things done and your forward moving momentum will thrust you into the next level. It is amazing how much you can accomplish when you don't procrastinate.
B00BN2NY48|3|The acrobatics were impressive but the storyline seemed contrived to me
B00OX3F1JK|5|Excellent. It's one of those reads that you can't put down. From the start I was hooked. Government and Vatican at war with each other. 2  people caught in the middle. Can't wait to read the next book.

B009G41CG2|5|I play the game often and love how there are very few ads popping up with it.
B0060MYM7O|5|I'm just getting started on second season. I wanted to wait for this DVD to come out so I could watch all episodes consecutively...Game of Thrones is the best nontheatre  movie I  have ever seen! But the reason I am writing this review before even watching it all (I know it's great) is to thank Amazon...wow...you guys are The Best. I ordered the movie set blue ray, like, yesterday! Not only for almost half price of f what it will be sold for in stores but it was in my post office box , THE NEXT DAY! How's that for excellent service? The movie was made available Feb. 19...I had it in my box Feb.20th...freaking awesome...enough said
B006RXQ3GO|5|Even after all these years, this movie is still great. The chemistry, the story line, great actors, it all works. Definitely a chick flick!  : )
B0054JZC6E|4|I like this game. it keeps me occupied. I like how simple the games are and they are super fun!
B00DPM7TIG|5|What a wonderful sad story about the goodness in people.  I highly recommend it and wished it could have gone on and on...
B00E9A656K|1|This app is boring ignorant and i hate it. Everythings overpriced and all you do to control the car is press one button. If you have any sense in you dont get it. You will regret it.
B00FPOSDGY|3|I do not take to starting a book and not finishing although I have been guilty of this on maybe 4 occasions in the past.  I did not finish this book.<br /><br />This book is so slow...so not interesting...easy to put down..easy for me to stray from.<br />I read 100 pages of the 230 or so pages and was not at all into the story. Pretty ease to lay this one down.<br /><br />So...for me...I just didn't get it.<br /><br />I did find out what the book was about and how it ended by way of my wife...I was not disappointed that I did not finish it.<br /><br />Just not my kind of read!!
B00992CF6W|1|Mine won't let me do multi player I can't get wolves just farm animals . So much for a 6.99 game.
B004XJRQUQ|5|Couldn't put this down, great book and writing was a little upset that it ended. But I'll read it again and again as well as recommend this to everyone.
B00B2V66VS|5|good
B002K0WBXW|5|I loved this movie! I'm not generally a fan of movies many would consider \\"chick flicks\\" - but romantic comedies (heavy on the comedy) can be a lot of fun. Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds and Bettie White - along with many, many others - make this an enjoyable movie. Like many in this genre, it is not terribly complex - rather, it's a good movie when you're looking to relax and not put a lot of brain power into your evening entertainment. If you're looking for a cute and fun movie to relax with, this is a good choice!
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I loved it!!!!! The Only downside is having to wait for the next book to come out!!!! Lol
B00HGJ18C2|5|easy to use  and always available
B0099Y2MYK|5|Historical verses fiction, romance and adventure complete with deceit and evilly crafted sibling rivalry. Costumes according to the era and the scene makes one want to live at Highclere Castle. Absolutely love this series!
0060987464|2|The Christian Right does not hate Manson. We Love Manson. We love him so much that we want to share the truth of the Gospel with him in the prayer that Our Heavenly Father might bring Manson to Himself through His son Jesus Christ. If Manson would only turn from his sin and repent, see Jesus as the Lord of all things that He is, and believe the Father raised Him from the dead then he would understand the love we have for him brought about by our love for Christ.
B00001R3GI|4|I always preferred the Beatles, but I did enjoy this album when it was first released.  This album includes many different styles and sounds.  This is the Stones at their best.  Yes Sticky Fingers is good too, but this  recording shows the versatility of Mick and the Stones.  The remastered  version sounds especially crisp and clean.  Songs such as TUMBLING DICE,  LOVING CUP, SWEET BLACK ANGEL, HAPPY, and others show how great the Stones  are as a band.  This should be required listening for all classic rock  fans.
B000XUBFE2|5|This book touch my heart better than a love story . It was written with determination of truth, strength &  love. Love was not given in kisses &  hugs but with knowledge & kindness &  knowing the simplicity is more valuable then riches. Kindness & thoughtful & dedication are gifts to be treasured forever, for those gifts stay with you forever & no one can take them from you.
B00I29VGMC|5|This was a book that, upon finishing, I wanted to flip back to the first page and immediately read it all over again. It was so. good. The characters are unique, well-developed, and intriguing. The story did not lag at all - I could not put it down and read it almost all the way through without stopping. There's a reason this has almost all 5 star reviews. One of my new favorites, without a doubt. I look forward to reading more from Mia Sheridan.
B007ZGO7EM|5|this app is simple and to the piont. i love that i can see the last equation in the lower display box.

B000002H33|5|\\"Master of Puppets\\" in undoubtedly one of the greatest recordings of all time.  In my opinion, \\"Master\\" has one of the greatest sounding guitar tones that I have ever heard and if you want to talk about tight and precise playing then this is the album to talk about!  \\"Master\\" is one of the best metal albums ever and is in my top ten of most awesome releases ever.  Sadly, it was Cliff Burton's last album with Metallica.  He was  killed in a tour bus accident while in Europe in 1986 and never lived to see the success that Metallica had attained later in thier career.  Who knows what they would have sounded like had Cliff lived.  All I can say is that it totally screwed up the band and they took it real hard when he died.  Metallica moved on though.  These days though, I think Metallica is a lost soul of a band and they will never be able to top \\"Master of Puppets\\" both in songwriting and shear brutality.  Cliff wrote some of the stuff on \\"Master\\" such as the beginning of \\"Damage Inc.\\" and parts of the instrumental of \\"Orion\\".  If you buy any album from the 80's, as far as metal goes, \\"Master of Puppets\\" fits nicely with Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" and Megadeth's \\"Peace Sells But Who's Buying?\\".  Metallica's third cd is a must have.  Buy it if you don't have it by now.  It is essential.
1420926217|5|In New York City, the Public Theater stages two free Shakespeare plays in Central Park each summer. This year, the first of these plays will feature Sam Waterston, who will act the role of Prospero in THE TEMPEST in a two-week run. For me, this is must-see event (even though I didn’t particularly care for “Law & Order”) and a reason to reread this fine play.<br /><br />IMHO, THE TEMPEST is touched with genius. There are, for example, some great (but brief) soliloquies—Caliban lovingly describing his island home, Prospero renouncing his magic, and Prospero commenting about the end of the masque (our revels are now ended…we are the stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep). There is also much humor, especially when the teenage Miranda gets her first glimpse of a boy or Ferdinand labors at the wood pile. And there are moving testimonials of love and an exciting action scene, when a magical storm seems to wreck a ship.<br /><br />Nonetheless, THE TEMPEST, on this reading, seemed more like the practiced work of an old master. HAMLET, KING LEAR, OTHELLO, ROMEO AND JULIET… these are the abundant and inspired works of a genius. In contrast, THE TEMPEST is a well-made platform freighted with various dovetailing characters and subplots—the likable Ariel versus the hideous Caliban, the loyal and decent Gonzalo versus the murderous Sebastian, the treachery of nobles and the treachery of fools, and so on. This is a very nice play and perfect for the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, where the backdrop is Turtle Pond and everyone has a good time. But Bill has done better.<br /><br />My version of THE TEMPEST was published in The Riverside Shakespeare, a tome of the complete works that is, alas, too big and bulky to rest comfortably on a reader’s lap. In my edition, Hallett Smith (Cal Tech) provides an informative essay about the play, which contains a masque that is tedious to read (Great Juno comes, I know her by her gait…”) but might be fun to stage. Following the play, The Riverside Shakespeare also provides notes on the text, where the editor observes: “Shakespeare’s authorship of the somewhat flat and plodding masque in Act IV, Scene 1, has often been questioned…” This is good to know.<br /><br />Anyway, I’ve done my homework and look forward to seeing THE TEMPEST in Central Park. BTW, the last time I went to the Delacorte, a raccoon, evidently bored by the show, lumbered across a corner of the stage and, as if by magic, vanished into the park during an expository moment in the first act. Somehow, the unflappable actress on stage made this feral incursion seem an inspired and planned aspect of the production.owing the play, The Riverside Shakespeare also provides notes on the text, where the editor observes: “Shakespeare’s authorship of the somewhat flat and plodding masque in Act IV, Scene 1, has often been questioned…” This is good to know.

B00V4JHNZG|4|As always left me wanting more...the mark of a good story, however the movie was less eventful than the story I imagined while reading it.  For the first time with the movies I found my self slightly disappointed
B00932A4XE|3|Fun, some very funny scenes. This was better than I expected. A good filler for when you can't find anything else and love romantic comedies.
B00F91RYL8|4|Good movie

B00005QDW5|5|We all know that it is nearly impossible to compile Pink Floyd's work into any sort of &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection. This is because of the conceptual leanings of their lyrics, the long and meandering tracks, and their method of creating full and integrated albums, instead of just individual songs. Of course you should buy the original albums (especially *Meddle* through *The Wall*) to truly explore the intricacies and strengths of Floyd's work. With these challenges in mind however, *Echoes* is actually a pretty enjoyable and believable compilation. This is because of the very creative ways in which the collection was put together. Since songs usually blended into each other on the original albums, they do the same here, leading to unknown connections between seemingly unrelated songs that may just boggle your mind. First, the band was not afraid to cut some time off of &quot;Echoes&quot; (chopping off seven minutes), or &quot;Shine on You Crazy Diamond&quot; (only including seven of the nine parts). True fans will return to the originals for the full story, but they'll also see that these edits strengthen this compilation. And then there's the unusual segues between tracks. A good example is the post-Waters &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; (1987) blending into the pre-Gilmour &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; (1967). You'd be surprised by the connections between these songs that seem to have absolutely nothing in common. Having songs from all different periods of the band's history sitting next to each other in strange ways really brings their history together, revealing common threads that you wouldn't notice by listen to the original albums one at a time.<br />And finally, at least 75% of the reviewers here on Amazon are whining about the song selection in one way or another. Well get over it. I have some minor disputes with the selections myself, but what can you do about it? You can't please all the people all the time. Instead, enjoy this collection as a career-spanning retrospective, and a collection of great Floyd songs.anning retrospective, and a collection of great Floyd songs.
B00LCT494Q|2|It's not terrible.  That's really the most favorable point I can make.  I read through a number of reviews, and I just don't know how anyone finds this to be a five star album.  It's certainly not a &#34;must have&#34; for me, as it has almost no replay appeal.<br /><br />It's listenable, and it isn't cringeworthy.  But it is dull, the songwriting doesn't make me feel anything at all, and musically it simply isn't notable.  However, most of us were drawn to RA for his abilities as a lyricist, so I don't hold the latter against him.  The writing on this album isn't bad, especially by most standards, but it just drew out no response for me.<br /><br />There has been some talk about a Ryan Adams/Jason Isbell collaboration, and while I originally thought about how good that might be for Isbell, I'm now wondering whether it might do Ryan more good.
0446677450|5|Our accountant recommended this book, and I am sure glad he did.  I read it in just a few days because it was so interesting.  This isn't a typical \\"get rich\\" book since I found that the author was definitely trying to teach the reader how to rethink the way he or she views money.  Some people might think that he is holding back by not going more into detail about how he made his millions, but trust me, if you read between the lines and really pay attention, he does give you some hints on how he got started.  He does reinforce a lot of his information, but he is a teacher, and teachers I find are usually repetitive to make sure that they get their points across.  This is a great starter book for anyone looking to make their money work for them.  And for those of you with children, this book (or Rich Dad for Teens) will help get them on the right track.
B000002IZ4|5|this cd is awesome it starts off with a kick arse song meat plow.....but my fav songs on the cd are interstate love song and BIG EMPTY ( me and my g/f had our first kiss to this song )<BR>i recommend EVERBODY listens to this cd.

068484267X|4|this memoir winner of the pulitizer prize for fiction is a fictionalized account of the life of frank mccourt and his family from his birth and early years in NYC to the times when his family moved back to limerick in southern ireland ,and the grinding poverty and grim surroundings that mccourt and his brothers and sisters had to endure ,from his fathers difficulty in finding a job because of the fact of his coming from northern ireland and also when he had a job he would drink his wages before he went home ,in turns heartbreaking and laugh out loud it mines a vivid picture of life in the 30's and 40's in ireland and new york city the only thing that would spoil your enjoyment would be the knowledge of the fact that is this is part FICTION and it would be interesting to know how much is truth and how much has been a product of mccourts imagination.
B0089LOG02|4|Well written, the book grabbed you from the first page.  A little known piece of American history was made known.  This is a book you want to share and discuss, and would be excellent for high school readers as a look into our past.
B000005RQT|3|This is a good album for those enjoy deep purple. Tracks like speed king, and child in time worth the album.
B000TDIEX8|4|It has all the cinematic emotion that made the movies great. If you like rocky this album will take you through all the ups and downs he went though,all the classic them music is there and then some.
B001UV4XWY|5|Great story.  Great Flick.
B00AKKS278|4|Very &#34;salesy&#34; but still inspired me to change my behavior and it has been great!
B0034G4OVS|1|This movie is not worth the one star I gave it as it was the most rediculous, movie because of the lack of knowledge the three people on the chair-lift have. They don't even have the sense to pull their clearly pull up around the faces coats.  When the lift is stuck and they are left on over night it goes down hill from there.  These people are SO stupid.  One jumps with legs extended in a straight position and ends up with compound francture in both legs. That's before he get's eaten by wolves.  The two left start bickering and don't for one minute try to think out a practical reason on how to get down.  The second male crosses the cable by hand and because it is so sharp it rips his hands apart.  Finally, he makes it to a lift support and ladder, goes down, then starts down the mountain only to be eaten also by wolves.  The only female is left on the lift quickly getting frostbite only to have the seat rip from the cable and fall with her hanging on.  She slides down the mountain on her stomach passing bloody, completely gross 1/2 eaten corpes and is finally picked up.  This is not a movie to show anyone how to exits in cold conditions, but it sure is one to show them how stupid anyone can be in the circumstances.
B00001IVOF|5|this is an incredible album. buy it trust me.
B0007PALZ2|5|I've loved this movie since highschool and was so happy to find it without having to buy Mercury Rising or some other bad movie along with it. Why do they always package a bad movie with a really good one?? Anyways, it came in tip top shape and was watched the same.
B00992CF6W|5|This app is one of the best ones I have! In fact, it really brings you the computer version. I reccomend this to EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO USES A TABLET :-D<br /><br />It also gives you a good challenge. Creeper almost killed me 3 times!!!
B0094BB4TW|1|I am unable to use chat for some reason. It shows on right side go to click on someone it then disapears so stupid.
0525952926|5|Writing long mandatory reviews is annoying and people should not be forced to write anything. A star system is enough to express opinion.
B00BUAEYVK|5|excellent
B00BHHIWQO|5|this is a good game I enjoy playing this game hope other people enjoy it as much as I do.would recommend it to everyone
B003K16P3M|5|Great book, the best of the series in my opinion. I found it hard to stop reading once I started. The characters are very easy to fall in love with, or hate, depending on their action. I was hooked from the first word of this book to the last word of Bitterblue. A must read in my opinion. Such an exciting series, keeps you at the edge of your seat, you never know what is around the next turn. Brilliantly written, imaginative!
0671688782|5|We used 'holding time' for those times when our older daughter went completely out of control: hitting us, spitting, trashing her room, won't stay in timeout, etc. It was very successful for us. So successful, that we almost never use it now. My wife and I found Holding Time complementary to Rosemond's 'Making the 'Terrible' Twos Terrific.' Ignore the author's insistence that the technique only works for mothers. It works with fathers, too!
0394826817|1|Hated it.
B00008DDSC|5|I suppose I may be impartial due to the fact that this may well be one of my favorite movies of all time, but there is so much beauty in this script, it's hard to refrain from telling everyone I know!  This is a movie that is definitely not for everyone but the first time I saw this, it left me wanting to watch it again.  Some people will watch this and say \\"Wow\\" while others will say \\"What the hell did I just watch?\\"    The movie begins with a fabulous performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal in her first starring role, as Lee, a troubled soul who finds comfort in self-mutilation, leaving a mental hospital.  After a stint for cutting too deep - \\"I don't know how I could have misjudged, I've been doing it since the seventh grade...\\" - she returns home to her dysfunctional family to try to begin life over again with the skills she has obtained from the institute.  Soon it seems, everything returns right back to the way it was - her father's out-of-control drinking, her parents fighting, her impulsively wanting to cut herself, but Peter enters and she finds some comfort in her high-school friend.    Lee enters a class in college to learn to type and soon is an efficient enough typist to decide to apply for a job she found in the paper, secretary.  James Spader, as attorney E. Edward Grey, who is also fabulous in this movie, enters as the neurotic, offbeat attorney.  From the beginning we find that Mr. Grey has his faults - ever wonder why there is a permanent \\"Secretary Wanted\\" sign outside his office?    Mr. Grey begins to get more and more \\"strict\\" it would seem with Lee, commonly using humiliation as a way to intimidate Lee.  One day Mr. Grey sits Lee down and asks her about the cutting - he has several times noticed signs of such.  He has a wonderful heart-to-heart with Lee and it is apparent that something between the two of them click as he tells her she will never cut herself again, have her mother pick her up from work and he lets her leave for the day, telling her towalk home through the park because she \\"requires relief.\\"  Lee feels something inside of her and Mr. Grey growing and she senses a form of freedom deep inside herself because her gave her \\"permission\\" to do so.  But the next day, he is back to humiliating her, which ultimately leads to spankings and a world of sadism and masochism.    The beautiful part of the film finds Lee slowly coming out of her shell and finding more confidence in who and what she is.  Mr. Grey brings something out in her that she was not aware she had.  Slowly, she finds herself attracted to Mr. Grey and his faults, while Mr. Grey finds that although Lee brings out something in him, he is too conflicted to understand himself.  He too cares for Lee, who helps him fulfill his needs, yet he feels disgusted because of what he does.    Then the day comes along in which Mr. Grey decides he cannot continue to live like this - he feels that if Lee does not go, he will not be able to stop engaging in the activity that he, as employer and Lee, as employee, partake.  The movie climaxes here and finds two souls lost until they found each other, broken apart.  What happens to them?  What happens to Peter?  I'm not going to divulge any more of this movie as I'm sure I have gone on enough, but trust me when I say that this is a must-see movie.  You may not like it, or you might, but just watch it.  I guarantee it'll be like no movie you've seen before!
B00OGYUV14|5|Belle and Sebastian continue to grow - continue to amaze. Stuart Murdoch is a song writing genius fortunate enough to have a band who knows how to interpret his songs to a T. The contributions by Sarah Martin and Stevie Jackson are stellar.
B005LAII9O|5|Just a great movie- really enjoy watching it.  I love the &#34;Metal & Wood&#34;.  It's a movie to get lost in as well as become aware of some pretty scary things that happens. I like the &#34;happy&#34; part of life and agree with living in this concept, but never to hurt…I DO REALIZE this is a &#34;movie&#34;.
B004SBQGHS|5|Who doesn't love shooting birds at the mean pigs? Very fun and addictive game that you just don't seem to tire of.

B0064MPXFA|5|Love this show!!!
B00KFUU6H2|5|History comes alive. the personalities of our founding fathers surprises and delights! very informative.
B0075MFS9Y|5|Anyone who likes acoustic sounds and great song-writing should buy this album.  It's been years since I found an album I can listen to as frequently as this one.
6305076995|5|I get tired of reading complaints about the sound quality and lack of camera angles, extras etc. I understand the critisism concering \\"Live In Philadelphia\\", but not this one. The sound here is raw, but the instruments are balanced. What`s wrong with you people? Do you want to  see Yes at the peak of their career or not?   It`s amazing!!!   Buy or die!!!!
B00BHU9DUK|5|Having read the book I wondered how they would edit the story to fit but I was not disappointed.  I am curious how somebody would rate the movie if they haven't read the book. The movie is filmed as a sort of play/movie hybrid that I actually enjoyed very much.
B003MC5N28|5|This book is very interesting and I loved it! It's very like wanting to know more after you finish each chapter. The first three chapters are a little confusing but once u get pas  them your going to want to read the next book!
B00IIUATDM|2|Its eh
B000BKJ78U|5|The only reason people are rating this package low is because it's not the original cut. A lot of people are just copying the early-mid 90s laserdiscs to DVD at this point.  <br /> <br />I do think that they should have given the customers the individual versions like Coppola did with \\"Godfather\\", and maybe George will, but also keep in mind 2 years from now is the 30th anniversary of \\"Star Wars\\". Spielberg gave in on \\"ET\\" with 2 versions for a bit (although I think he has the revamped version on market now). If the originals are released, it'll be around that time and prob. as part of a huge package to get people on board hi def DVD.  <br /> <br />I've watched the revamped trilogy more than once and still enjoy it as much as the untouched version, but the 4 disc set has a really good documentary about the making of (watch \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" to see a movie made by Terry Gilliam in the desert that failed miserably...Lucas wasn't that far off back when). If you're not the type to lose sleep over \\"Han shot first\\", want to save a few bucks and aren't the type to watch \\"making ofs\\", this is worth it because it is still one of the best trilogies ever made.

B00RVBY8KO|5|Nostalgic. Convincing. Universal.
0345803485|1|First off I do not understand for a second why this book has become so huge! I was insulted as a woman when I read this book and cringed multiple times, the only reason I kept going was in the naïve hope something good would come out of it and it would magically have something to offer. This book encourages woman to be treated like brainless, submissive morons and the fact that women found it so romantic absolutely kills me! Not only was it promoting sticking through abusive toxic relationships but the writing was lacking any skill. Please spend your money and time elsewhere, trust me!
B00BTYP6QE|5|Really enjoyable
1502378167|1|This book was awful. I bought this as a gift for my mom, but I am returning it because it seems like the entire text was simply GOOGLE TRANSLATED instead of actually translated, so the story does not make sense in Urdu. Thanks a lot.
B009LDXQGW|5|So I did listen to his first two free ep's but I refused to listen to the last one he put out because the sound quality was trash on the other MP3s. He definitely ensured these were on point. I already enjoyed the two albums I did hear but the sound quality was trash. I spend good money on my audio equipment and when I play MP3's I really hear the imperfections. Most people enjoy crappy MP3's but not I. They make my ears bleed.<br /><br />IF you want the best quality out, buy this cd. If not just continue listening to the trashy A$$ free Mp3 version he put out for free. Dont be an idiot and spend money to buy the MP3's again from amazon.....CD or bust.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Awesome!!
B0018OFN4U|5|it's hard to explain why this movie works so well. It's 'Movie Chemistry' - that elusive element that turns them into 'have to own and rewatch'. We must watch this every couple of months at least.
B000UZ4OYS|5|This is a beautiful album full of beautiful songs. This is one of my absolute favorites. José González has a great voice and musical style that's capable of transporting you to otherworldly places.
B00B52F278|5|Most exciting show ever!!!!!!!  So cool!
B0018AK9RA|5|I've been counting down to this album a long time and the album is finally out. It lives up to everything I thought it would be. Between the interludes you will find one of the most ambitious heavy metal albums ever. Only Judas Priest could be so bold, so \\"Metal\\" to do a double CD about the life of Nostadamus, even Spinal Tap dared not do that. Get it, enjoy it and be swept away on an epic journey.    This album is a real steal I got it for $11.99 and used the code to a get a free ticket to the Metal Masters tour. What an amazing tour, Testament one of the best thrash bands ever, followed by Motorhead then the almighty Judas Priest. Real Metal lives. Get this album go see the show and live the madness.
B009LDD4Z0|5|This season definitely kept the series and its' fans on its' toes. I was surprised at some of the final things that happened in Season seven, especially in regards to Brennan and Booth finally coming together and having a child. I did not know what to expect this season, but I was happily surprised to see that the writers did it again, delivering a solid series of episodes that keep you guessing and engaged. In this season Booth and Brennan continue to work on their relationship. On top of this the season also has some great mystery and intrigue that keep the show continuing for as long as is has. if you are looking for a series that has a little of everything, look no further than here!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
0316168815|4|The way this story is told is very intriguing. - Susie Sammons is dead and narrating from heaven.   <br />The characters are very intriguing. - A strong and silent dad, and mid-life-crisis mom, etc. <br />And so though I'd recommend the book as a good summer read, I was also a bit disappointed by the ending. <br />It was a little strange.  And a let down.
B00688628M|5|This is the soldier's soldier story.  The best thing that has been on television for as long as there has been television.

B00000DBXL|5|First and foremost, I love this album. I LOVE it. Cake sort of has this &quot;background music to 'Scooby Doo'&quot; sound to them. Impressive lyrics too. &quot;Sheep go to Heaven, Goats go to Hell&quot;. I'll be  completely honest here. I'm a songwriter/musician and I can't even imagine  the premise behind that line... it drive me crazy. The best I've ever  thought of was, well nevermind I'm off topic.<br />This is a wonderful album.  Everyone I know loves it (and I know a lot of people, let me tell you). I  think everyone should be issued this album by the Canadian government as  required listening for high school graduation. I can't think of anything  else to say.
B00005YUBL|4|There's a lot to like in this classic and highly acclaimed set. Wolfgang Sawallisch delivers a powerful, majestic Schumann, with plenty of rough-edged lyricism. He strikes a fine balance of expansiveness and clarity. Tempos are fairly well judged, but Sawallisch does push the pace too much at times, and often strives for bigness, bordering on aggresive/overbearing, and the orchestral play also suffers. At other times, Sawallisch opts for grandness and some legato that is too polished and smooth for my taste. The recorded sound is a huge plus. It is phenomenal, big and vivid with wonderful ambience. The highlights are the Second and Third, both outstanding interpretations that rank among the best. The Fourth is rushed and a bit sloppy. The First is acceptable but overheated and quite rushed (but this is not uncommmon among interpretations of the First).    This set is comfortably among the top options, even though it lacks the special spirit and quality of the cycle of George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, which to me remains a benchmark. Besides Szell's, few full Schumann cycles nail all four symphonies, although conductors Jerzy Semkow, Armin Jordan, Antoni Wit, Kubelik, Inbal, Herreweghe have delivered sets with some strong performances. Recordings of individual symphonies by Furtwangler (First and Fourth) and Fricsay (First) are essential and some others, such as Hans Zender, Michael Schonwandt (with Danish Radio), Gunter Wand, Paul Kletzki, Paul Paray, etc. are noteworthy.
B007QJAZTE|5|Awesome movie oldie but a goodie!!
B00DR0PDNE|2|The good stuff first.  Set-up was easy.  Twenty minutes after opening the box we were able to cast Netflix and Hulu Plus content to our Vizio HDTV.<br /><br />The bad?  Chromecast's wireless signal created interference when watching OTA TV stations.  Simple solution was to unplug the Chromecast when not in use.  Upon next start-up Chromecast device would not reconnect to internet.  To make matters worse, something in the Chromecast App was also preventing our Ipad from connecting to our wifi network.  Google support emailed as follows: &#34;please reset your router, restart your iPad. turn off wifi & turn back on. uninstall chrome. Now reset the Chromecast again & try again&#34; ... all because we powered the device down.  This is totally unacceptable for a consumer electronics device.  I am a longtime Amazon customer and this is the first item I've ever had to return.
B001FB4W0C|5|That pretty much says it all! Love the Winchesters and Cass!! I have read that the show was only supposed to last 4 years and there are some that think the show should have ended on that note. I for one am glad that it continues! The actors who play the brothers have a great connection on screen and I hope they remain in the roles as long as possible!! The season story arc is ok ... but I prefer the stand alone episode. Love the sci-fi, humor, action, mystery!! Have shared this show with others who have fallen in love with it too!! Will continue to watch and buy the seasons on DVD as long as they are around!!!
B009NPA3Q4|5|If you like Dave Matthews and Mumford and Sons you will love this CD!  Phillips sounds alot like both, but has his own unique sound too.  Well worth the money!

B00AESN8XY|4|The goal is a bit of a &#34;downer&#34;, in that you try to kill everyone on the Earth to win. But, in the process you gain an understanding of how pandemics can spread and become more lethal, to the point of being incurable. At the same time, you learn how a disease can become &#34;self-limiting&#34;, if it doesn't evolve properly. You can pay to start with more lethal pathogens, or, you can just pay for free, which is what I've done. Either way, you can progress through skillful manipulation of the disease characteristics.
B0083ZRAJS|4|What can you say about a classic? I read this series years ago and decided I would like to have it available on Kindle.
B002IKLZZY|5|If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan you know this is one of his best (in my opinion). It just gets better every time you watch it.
B000BW7QWW|5|I was a huge fan of the original, axe-murdered, Firefly TV show and was very eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD. Is it as good as the TV show?<br /><br />Trick question. TV allows for the episodic evolution of characters, and when you have nine so expertly sketched and acted as the cast of Firefly, that space is really key to the series. In a movie, you have 2 hrs -- give or more usually take -- which means hyper-compression, and a necessity to focus on only a very few arcs. But it also allows for some incredibly big thrills, chills, and explosions along the way.<br /><br />River and Mal are given center stage, along with the Reavers story, and creative mastermind Joss Whedon uses his trademark brilliant dialog, brutalizing emotional content, and jaw-dropping set pieces to full effect, every bit as funny, terrifying, and surprising as I've come to (happily) expect.<br /><br />The only caveat I would give is that people unfamiliar with the Firefly TV show should watch it. They don't have to do it first, but it will certainly magnify the weight of the movie if they do so at some point. Whether Serenity introduces them to Firefly or vice versa, its definitely a journey worth taking and characters worth experiencing.
B00AIUUXHC|5|This game is awesome! I have so much fun on it! I am the 'big daddy' on it and I have so much fun!
1591844096|5|Very good book and thought provoking and assist on in self analyzing ,
B004UJAOLM|5|Nearly all the people in the story have serious problems so it is a tale of dysfunctional people screwing up their own and others' lives, but I find it fascinating and Heathcliff must be The Antihero of all time.  I once had a Japanese student who told me she gave up studying English aged 15 after attempting to read Wuthering heights; she could not understand why the characters behaved as they did. Been reading this novel since I was a child and always notice something new.
B0058Z4NR8|4|The author gives a detailed description of the causes of the rise and fall of nations and relates it to now.  Copious examples too.

B000T05R90|4|I wouldn't call myself a Pink Floyd expert, and it was only recently that I began listening to this album. While I don't enjoy it as much as some of their later efforts, it's really begun to grow on me, and not only because the songs are great. While casually listening to this, it might appear as though the Pink Floyd sounds much like other bands of that type and era. In listening more closely, however, you can pick up the little ways in which they departed from the style of contemporary artists, and it's fun to listen to the dialects (for lack of a better word) of the musicians develop, to hear the blueprints for their unique sound being drawn.    (Unfortunately, I can't say anything good or bad about the anniversary edition, as my remarks are based solely on having listened to a previous release of the CD.)    I highly recommend The Piper at the Gates of Dawn for any Pink Floyd fan who would like to go beyond the requisite The Wall and Dark Side of the Moon.

B0098460O4|5|Beautiful album!  They are such a talented and exciting duo. It exceeded my expectations and I loved the album selections.
0689835604|5|My son and I loved a lot of Karen Katz's books, but WHERE IS BABY'S BELLY BUTTON? was one of our favorites. When the came time to give away our collection of board books, my son insisted on holding on to this one. He said it was too worn looking to give away (the flaps had all been taped back down multiple times). I just think he didn't want anyone else to have it because when I asked if we should throw it away, he said we should put it with his other baby mementos. Whenever I am recommending must haves to new parents, this book is always at the top of my list. Young children (and some grown-ups) can't help but imitate the babies in the book. Great interactive book for early literacy!
B00F3VOL38|4|Yea Yea Yea... its great that this is out.  But just to be clear, there are no songs on this album that being released for the first time.  Heavy Duty Beatle fans have been listening to all this material for decades.  Google &#34;Beatles at the BEEB&#34;.  Having said that, the BBC material is the ABSOLUTE BEST source for hearing what the Fab Four really sounded like.  NO multi-track and NO screaming fans..... FANTASTIC material.
B007HACDLK|5|Vince Flynn delivers another great book in his usual fast-paced manner.  I love his characters and the way that he keeps them consistent throughout the series.  Mitch Rapp is a hero.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I very much enjoyed this book and getting to follow familiar characters. Definitely recommend to any fans of his work.
B00C5R7F8G|4|A nice overview of the politics involved in safeing our nuclear weapons.  The human factor is always the major consideration.
0195067142|5|In this book you will follow the Marines in their battles on both Peleliu and Okinawa.  This book is not intended to give a full grasp of the entire Pacific campaign.  It is also not about the strategies involved for the taking of the islands.<br /><br />It is a book told from the perspective of the Marines and Soldiers that had to endure impossible conditions and hellish experiences.  This book is not for the faint-hearted.  It is graphic and gruesome, so the reader should be prepared for that.<br /><br />I first read this book while doing training maneuvers in my infantry company.  It made me laugh at the futility of what we were doing.  Nothing we trained for would have prepared us for the conditions these men endured.<br /><br />I also think that this is a good book for people wanting to understand the rationale used for the grave decision to employ atomic weaponry and end this war hastily.  This is not advocation per se of this form of warfare.  It is just a way to get into the minds of the people responsible for preventing more U.S. fatalities.
0735619670|5|Code Complete pops up regularly on the lists of the 'read this book or you'll never get a job and everyone else will laugh at you' genre, so if you're easily influenced, like me, you may approach this book with an air of duty rather than anticipation. Fortunately, despite its heft, this is well worth the plaudits that have been heaped upon it. I actually enjoyed this more than The Pragmatic Programmer and Programming Pearls, two books often mentioned in the same breath as this tome. <br /> <br />CC covers pretty much every part of the software development lifecycle, from planning to code reviews to testing. These are all pretty good discussions, but the best bit is definitely the chapters on coding. Most of the examples are in Visual Basic or Java, so you'd do well to know one of those languages. <br /> <br />When it comes to object modelling, there's actually a reasonable set of guidelines harvestable from literature, and languages tend to diverge more on issues of packaging, so CC is at its best at the lower level procedural details of code layout, formatting, loop construction, optimisation and so on. Many books claim to provide coding guidelines, but don't do much beyond stating the obvious like (for Java) \\"use camel case for variable names\\", \\"start class names with capital letters\\" and \\"avoid Hungarian notation\\". CC is different because it actually provides useful recommendations. As an example, there's a very good discussion on when and where the use of loop-breaking constructs like break and continue ('next' in Ruby and Perl) are appropriate. Few (if any) other books provide this sort of practical detail. <br /> <br />It's well-written, with just the right amount of humour in its exhortations - the withering references to coders who investigate loop bugs by randomly adjusting the termination criterion up or down by one until it works raised a wry smile from this reviewer. <br /> <br />To summarise, this is a collection of best practices distilled from a pretty huge amount of reading, and is genuinely helpful. I would certainly point any programming beginner at this book.
B0069JBKHI|1|If you are shopping for this product then you've already decided that you need audio and video monitoring of your infant child and would like perhaps some extra features (temp, humidity) and possibly access from beyond the confines of your home...  This product cannot deliver these things.<br /><br />THIS DEVICE WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION - this is a fact.<br /><br />So, if your internet connection goes down or if the Withings servers go down - then the system will not allow you to monitor your infant child... therefore it simple fails to deliver what you need it to.<br /><br />Like other reviewers I really wanted this to be great. It looks good, it felt like an Apple product, I even bought it in the Apple store, but sadly this is a Beta product at best and the designers need to build in the sort of fail-safes which any parent knows are essential in order to have a reliable system for monitoring the health and security of your child.<br /><br />Be warned, don't be fooled by advice from sales staff that the system will continue to work on a local Wifi connection without an internet connection (e.g. Airport Express system).  It won't. When the device cannot contact the Withings servers for whatever reason beyond your control then you lose operation.<br /><br />Returned mine for a full refund and went instead for a Summer Peek Plus Internet Monitoring system which allows monitoring over standard radio signal (like the old systems) with an internet gateway for viewing from outside the home. This way the only thing that could fail would be a protracted powercut leading to the rechargeable batteries draining.
B0085KGHI6|5|DON'T KNOW WHY THEY WAITED SO LONG TO PUT THIS ONE OUT. THIS IS THE ONLY KIND OF STUFF THE ROLLING STONES SHOULD BE PUTTING OUT ANY MORE. COME ON NOW LETS GET BACK TO THEIR ROOTS  !!!!
B0064X7FVE|2|Don't like the current version.  I also think it's a battery hog on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm going to delete it and try the local news channel.
1577314808|4|Live Like A Fruit Fly, a book i recently found on amazon, is much more practical and can make a big impact on your life.  It did with me.
B00BF123WG|5|Really enjoyed the behind the scenes look into the time, research and dedication it took to track down Bin Laden. Well made movie!!
0783239955|5|a very very funny movie.
B0067TQQI8|5|I usually don't leave reviews, but decided to make it a point to share my experience with this product and company. Received the battery and it did exactly as advertised, worked great for traveling and toting around for my phone's failing battery. However, I noticed recharging the battery began to be less consistent and was able to determine it was the micro USB connection. Eventually, the micro USB cradel completely detached and charging was impossible.<br /><br />All it took to process my warranty claim was to reply to the original email I received from the seller after my original order. The communication was fast and very pleasant. They sent out a replacement unit before even receiving my old one and also sent me a prepaid label to send back the defective battery.<br /><br />New battery seems to work exactly as expected. Excellent product, even better customer service.
B002MQYOFW|5|I loved this book.  I did see the movie first and I liked it too.  This is the first book I have read by this author.
B005HQ5S3G|5|I love Kelly Clarkson. She is amazing & so talent. I think this album really gave her the ability to move up to the next level. She's had my support from day one. No matter what she does she'll always have my support.
B000B8QEZG|5|The people who keep coming and posting the negative reviews and cra- here are from the organization called the TEAM L.A.M.B. They seem to me that they don't know what they are doing and are more importantly mentally sick!!! <br />So ignore these people's cra- and save your time by not reading it!! <br />Below is the post that they have on their website! <br />read it, people, and you will know that they are crazy and sick!! <br />of course they don't want to admit that MADONNA IS STILL THE QUEEN OF POP.  <br /> <br /> <br />Welcome to TeamLamb, an organized team of Mariah Carey fans. Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the no-talent ****, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.  <br /> <br />Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans. TeamLamb will do everything we can to make this project a flop for Madonna. We will organize by calling radio stations and telling them how muchwe don't like her new songs, write letters to several magazines and confirm that she is, indeed, over, and spread negative messages about Madonna on several Internet blogs. <br />
B00005M6AP|5|Know what? This simply shows how the legendary band still can rock hard. Even though they are at their late 40s and 50s they can still create the unique Scorpions amazing moments, also this shows that the Scorpions love to play live. Their live recordings are almost as great as their studio recordings.... the changed version of Holiday is as amazing as the original one... and the Queen's Love Of My Life has never sounded better. Klaus Meine's vocal is the key part in this acoustic album.
B003JTHXOK|5|I saw the movie first.. And the book is so much better. As with most movies that were books first. The suspense and the love story are great. I have a hard time reading. If I'm not drawn into a book in the beginning I usually won't finish, but I loved the whole book!!!
B00EEDJHXA|5|My 8 year old loves to play as much as I do. This helps with his critical thinking skills. I love watching him figure out each problem. Sometimes he had to think 2 steps ahead.
1596912375|5|If you like WWII spy novels, N.Y. and Hedy Lamar, this book is for you.  The book adds Russians into the mix instead of just Ivy League & Oxford vs. mean Nazi.  And some Baader-Meinhof is added to the mix, as well.  The book is not perfect, with people doing things a sane person would not do, but it is nonetheless a great read with interesting characters and a good story.  Worth the time, certainly.
B000UBMWG4|4|The first Blu-Ray I've purchased/seen. Much greater detail than NTSC or than I remeber as on the big screen at the movies.
B009XIXVU6|2|I have read all of Khaled Hosseini's  books. This book was just as well written in terms of his writing style and character development. I just didn'd like the way the story line was disjointed and somehow didnt get a feeling that all the characters in the book were necessary.
1439165653|3|Read like it was meant to be a movie.  Huge leaps of time.  I enjoy the concept but wish the writing was better.
B0084TWN9K|3|This book did not hold my interest and thought process, continuing to find a story  line - I found myself forcing to finish.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Really Fun game but much too short. Nice challenging fun. Looking forward to the next game.  I hope that it's longer.

B00EOARZ4G|5|I've read nearly all of the Jack Ryan series and this ranks up there with the best of them.<br />Action, mystery, and suspense run high as you follow the story of Jack Ryan Jr. the son of the sitting U.S. president, shortly after his departure from The Campus, an off the books intelligence unit established by his father during his first term. The Campus is on a training status due to events that nearly had them shut down for good. Meanwhile, Jack Jr. is in the U.K. doing analytics work on the legal side of things.<br />While digging into illegal activities and dealings with high level  Russians, Jack's father is also dealing with the Russians and a possible open war. The elder Ryan's past and present collide when old ghosts once again present themselves. This time around, Jr. gets caught up in the action as he chases down leads dealing with his new line of work.<br />The cast of The Campus are right there in the action as well as the actions of both Ryan's decide the fate of of a European nation.<br />I really enjoyed this book. I was devastated when I learned of Tom Clancy`s death, but I look forward to seeing what is still in the future for his book series`. There have been a number of co author's in the past and I am not sure how much of the writing is Clancy himself but I have high hopes that this series will continue.
B002PZ1H6E|5|a lovely and enchanting movie
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Good story. Didn't want to put it down.  I was sorry when I reached the end, but then I feel that way about all Baldacci's books.
B00N6PCXME|1|I usually like Ishiguro, but this book is a mess: clunky in plot, unbelievable in character development, and shallow in theme. It's hard to believe he let it be published, but I guess money makes us all do unwise things.
B004A8EI9M|5|When I heard people saying there was a great TV series that had to do with zombies I had my doubts. I thought it was going to be a little silly and therefore it took a long time for me to come back and decide to give it a shot. I was sorely mistaken, since once I started watching the first episode I was instantly hooked. There is nothing silly about this series, the story is cleverly crafted, there is suspense / horror for days and some of the plot twists will leave you breathless.<br /><br />This is a short first season, so you can go through it in a day, but luckily the following seasons are longer (13 and 16 episodes for seasons 2 and 3 respectively). The creators do a great job with posing questions and slowly giving us information getting us closer and closer to the answer. For example, we instantly start to wonder about what caused the zombie a.k.a. \\"walker\\" outbreak? Also, what are the exact mechanics by which contagion works? and why walkers have to be killed a certain way.<br /><br />Beside the great story line, there are some excellent performances in this series. I particularly like the job Jon Berthal, who plays an intense Shane, who was a police officer until the outbreak and who after everything changed rebuilt his world only to see things shift again drastically. Jon can communicate quite a bit with his eyes, and this is used quite a bit in the series. Norman Reedus is my other favorite actor in this series, he plays a redneck that has some handy abilities when shooting arrows and may also have a softer side in there somewhere.<br /><br />My advice if you have not given this a try yet is to hurry up and do it already. Don't be like me. Once you start you will be watching these non-stop until you run out of episodes. Yes, the series is that good!
B00HXYKYIE|5|My sister told me that I have to read this book. She was right. Well written, informative and such a great story. I was anxious to see how it ended but had to stop a few times during the last chapters because I couldn't read through my tears. It is very rare that a book gets me this emotional. This is a must read.
B00004X01U|5|Madonna's new album, MUSIC, is a mixed bag full of techno and folksy goodies. I cannot  say i hate one entire  song here, except, Impressive Instant DOES get on my nerves heavily ;) My favorite song here are: Runaway Lover, Don't tell me &lt;LOVE IT! and so do my friends! &gt;, paradise, and gone--oh my gawd--gone is to die for!. im so happy dont tell me will be released as a domestic single in the USA..:) :) :) Madonna scores again--it's as if anything she does is bound to be great :) please pick this up--it has something for everyone :) love ya bellas and beaux! --gabriel ;)
B001MW0J2Y|5|Each of the songs on this album are magnificent, and make me feel in the empyrean
B005AUWY90|3|Cars 2 is a fine movie. The visuals are stunning and the story is fun.    My biggest and really only disappointment with this blu-ray is that the disc is setup to default to a 16-bit 5.1 encoding of the audio track. So, if you have invested in the latest equipment, you must dive into the Languages menu to get 24-bit 7.1 audio. That's a huge bummer and likely the result of sloppy work over at Disney Home Video.
0553577123|5|Not by the book, but by some of the reviews. Apparantly \\"this book blows,\\" as one reviewer tactfully put it. If you take time out to insult a girl who died in such tragic circumstances then you have serious issues. You wouldn't be particularly happy if you were the one locked up for two years, starving and crying in a concentration camp and then having people talk smack about you and your diary. If the book was seriously rubbish, thousands of people today would not be so moved and inspired by it. I'd like to make the assumption that you are too immature to understand the significance of it. Take a step back and don't accuse me of being Anne Frank's obsessed fan with no life when it is in fact you who need to get lives. And as for the book being boring, remember that most of what is written in it was intended for Anne's eyes only. She didn't open her diary and write the first entry thinking, \\"Hmmm, I'll bore my future readers to tears by writing the dullest diary I can!\\" Please, don't dishonor Anne Frank.

B0000C8WYB|5|\\"Chante Piaf\\" (Songs of Piaf) was the first Mireille Mathieu CD I bought, and it amazed me.  How could I have been unaware of such a great and talented singer?  I had seen Mireille Mathieu on American television in the late 1960's, but had forgotten her.  All I remembered was she was a petite woman with a large voice, and was roughly my age.  I saw \\"Chante Piaf\\" in a CD catlogue in about 1996, and remembered her.  I bought the CD out of curiosity.  After I listened to it, I immediately wanted more of her CDs, but could not find more.  It was roughly five years before I found another Mireille Mathieu CD and ten before I was able to start a collection.  I now have forty of her CDs, and a number of her LPs.<br /><br />Her performances of the thirteen Piaf songs on this CD are wonderful.  Among the Piaf songs on the CD are: \\"La vie en rose\\" (A Rose-colored Life), Piaf's signature song; \\"Sous le ciel de Paris\\" (The Sky of Paris, aka \\"Under Paris Skies\\"); \\"Mon Dieu\\" (My God!); \\"Exodus\\"; \\"L'hymme a l'amour\\" (Hymn to Love); \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" (No, I have no regrets); and \\"Mon manege a moi\\" (Caught in My Own Trap) which is my favorite song on the CD. Many of these songs are classics.  So is Mireille Mathieu's performances of them.<br /><br />Addendum 2012:  The original CD which I bought was distributed by Atlantic Records in 1993.  Since then it has been re-released in 2003 by Capitol and in 2012 by Ariole (Sony Music Germany).  In the latest re-release, Ms Mathieu has recorded three new songs which have been added: \\"A quoi ca sert l'amour\\" (What good is love?); \\"Les trois cloches\\" (The three bells); and \\"La goualante du pauve Jean\\" (The tale of poor Jean).  Those Americans with long memories will recognize these two final songs as hits here in the late 1950's.  The Three Bells was a hit by The Browns after it was converted to English, and \\"La goualante du pauve Jean\\" was an instumental hit under the title \\"The Poor People of Paris\\".  Of course, Ms. Mathieu sings the three additional songs wonderfully.e three additional songs wonderfully.

B00RLK35H2|5|This is the finest series of the year, in my opinion. All of the actors have played their parts to the letter, making Diana Gabaldon's book come alive with excitement, suspense and, of course, romance. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to watch a quality program that makes history come alive.
0446677450|4|This book is great for revolutionizing the way you think about finances.<br />Robert Kiyosaki has a excelent writing style that makes this book humourous and easy to read.  By placing emphasis on changing thought patterns about money over specific details makes the reader want to find out about how to capture the wealth they are capabile of.

B002ZG99QS|5|Loved the first one, now I've had the fun of sharing both with my own children (all loved them both). The soundtrack was incredible visuals pure eyecandy (again a GOOD thing). I loved the little tips of the hat to the first movie such as Sam's comment about the door. When you watch/rent/buy this movie make sure you just want to sit back and have fun. It bothers me when I read reviews of movies such as this one and they tear it apart. The reviewers look for things that the movie was never meant to be about. Its meant to allow us to suspend belief for a couple hours out of our mundane existence and JUST HAVE FUN. If your so into nitpicking everything to death, do the rest of us a favor and go back into your box and don't leave. Enjoy the movie for what it was meant to be, entertainment. Stop looking for how things would be in the real world...don't we all get enough of that already?

B00000AFGM|3|Mechanical Animals is Marilyn Manson's reckless abandonment of industrial grind for stadium-friendly glam.  Strangely enough, Marilyn (the person) fits the role of post-Bowie androgyny like a glove and he belts out  apocalyptic attacks on human shallowness.  The production is muddled and  the songwriting is uneven, but it's an interesting piece of melodrama for  the new millennium. Best Tracks: &quot;Coma White,&quot; &quot;Rock Is  Dead,&quot; &quot;The Dope Show&quot; Rating: 6/10

B000WTZ784|4|As I am sure a number of reviewers have pointed out one has to give Genesis credit for plugging away into the 1990's even after,again losing yet another lead vocalist. On the other hand I had no clue this album even existed until this point. And I must admit it speaking strictly in terms of material this album actually is a lot more interesting in many ways from [[ASIN:B000WTZ78Y We Can't Dance]],the bands final album with Phil Collins. The music presented here basically melds elements of 90's alternative rock with Genesis's classic sound.But really the overall sound,again doesn't deviate much from the Genesis/Mike+The Mechanics sound of the mid to late 1980's.Many of these songs are quite good-the memorable \\"Shipwrecked\\" (a deserved hit) and songs like \\"Alien Afternoon\\" and \\"If That's What You Need\\" which show the band hasn't lost it's progressive chops one bit.Drummers Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D.Virgilio don't sounds a lot like Phil Collins but they certainly make their mark-taking inventive turns with the exception of the last song \\"One Man's Fool\\",which almost qualifies as a Phil Collin's ripoff in the drumming department. The alternative rock side of it isn't strong in the instrumental area even though some songs have harsher guitars now and then but they come mostly in the lead vocals of Ray Wilson. For 1997 I suppose he thought a good way to maintain Genesis's commercial integrity. But fact is he kind of sounds like a lot of other alt-rock vocalists of the era-breathy,distant and lacking in vocal range. But I find it interesting how Ray's more contemporary singing style blends with Genesis's sound,which truthfully is still very similar to their 80's \\"proggy pop/rock\\" style. Truth is though alternative rock singing was never my personal favorite vocal style in the world (largely as I was OD'd on it from radio in this era) but this album is full of music that is quite strong and,to be honest I bet if Phil Collins (or even Peter Gabriel) sang on this album it's commercial fate would surely have been better.But somehow I don't think it's over for Genesis as a studio band.We'll all just have to see.commercial fate would surely have been better.But somehow I don't think it's over for Genesis as a studio band.We'll all just have to see.

B00JP5ONY0|3|Ben Stiller's version of James Thurber's story is much better than the earlier one starring Danny Kaye, which I would give one star.  In Stiller's version there are fewer daydreams and situations that develop Mitty's determination to succeed.  In other words Mitty become a fully developed character instead of a bumbling clown.

Because ever sense out fit 7 made talking Angela I have been creeped out and have uninstalled this app then install it  2 days ago and found out that every time tom blinks it takes a photo of you

B000069AUI|5|At the Grammys, this album won Alt Rock album of the year, which is great because, they're alt rock, but this album beats out all of the nominees for Album of the Year...A stellar track and great lyrics too.  Awesome when performed live.<br />Politik - A rousing opener.  It also puts to rest the description of Coldplay as softies.<br />In My Place - The first single off of this album<br />God Put A Smile... - Catchy acoustic guitar riff, but the catchiness doesn't ruin the track...lyrics are just excellent.<br />The Scientist - Another single and what a great single it is.  This is one of the best tracks from the album.  The piano is so stunning and the lyrics are some of the best they've ever written. <br />Clocks - Their breakout single.  Still another great song.<br />Daylight - Wonderful playing by Jon, Will, and Guy...The guitar riff is kind of psychedelic and it has a great bass line.<br />Green Eyes - Another love song by Coldplay...<br />Warning sign - I love this track.  This song has lyrics that rival \\"The Scientist\\".  The song is just so beautiful.<br />A Whisper - Another heavy song with pounding guitars. <br />A Rush Of Blood To The Head - One of the most emotional songs on the album.  The lyrics about revenge are just captivating.  It starts out with just Chris on the acoustic gutiar but slowly, the band joins him and makes this song one of the best on the album. <br />Amsterdam - Ah, yes...the closing song.  This time it's Chris on the piano for the first couple verses, but then it transforms into the entire band and again more great lyrics.<br />So if you don't have this album, BUY IT!  If you don't have Parachutes, BUY THAT TOO! They won't disappoint.
0062502182|5|After reading The Alchemist several years ago, I recently reread it, and found that it is one of those few books that has the power to change your life every time you read it. What I find so marvelous about this book is that it can be read on many different levels: younger readers could enjoy the fairy-tale adventure of Santiago as he seeks out his treasure, whereas older readers pick up on the extended allegory woven into the novel. Every page is rich with symbolism and hidden threads of meaning.<BR>       What is so very brilliant about this book is that it has the ability to take one of its messages and connect it macrocosmically with the very structure of the novel. One of Coelho's main ideas is that omens and signs about one's destiny are scattered throughout life in order to be found, and in the actual novel, Coelho has scattered his own foreshadowing and metaphors in a way that mimics an inherent truth about life. The effect is that the reader learns to have trust in life, and it helps them to believe that when they follow their own Personal Legends, the universe truly does \\"conspire to help them\\" in their endeavors.<BR>       I recently read another novel that seems to reinforce the uplifting theme of pursuing one's destiny where it lies. Sands of the Desert, by Stacy Chudwin, follows the journey of the princess Serepta as she escapes betrothal to her wicked cousin. She journeys through many mysterious lands, and this journey, as I interepreted it, is an intricate allegory as well. Each part of the book (\\"Up a Mountain,\\" \\"Down a Stream,\\" \\"To the Pyramid\\") all seem to represent the successive stages in a person's life. Like Coelho's fable, it also can be read on many levels, which proved to be true when my daughter in eighth grade enjoyed just it as much as I did. The quick paced story held her attention, as did the fact that the author, Chudwin, is only 16 years old! Both The Alchemist and Sands of the Desert seem to have the ability to take universal themesabout destiny and truth and deliver them with a rich, imaginative plot. I would highly recommend them both.

B009UX2YAC|5|I love Subway Sufers even though I get mad sometimes I feel proud of myself when I complete missions.  P.S If it's called Subway Surfers why does it take place on train tracks.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book is popular for a reason! I read the series right before the movies came out and I am glad I did. The end of each chapter makes you want to read what is next, the book pulls you in and you have to force yourself to put it down. I really enjoyed this book even though it was a crazy concept.
B002MQYOFW|5|I loves this book! It was the best book I've ever read! You should really read it it is the absolute BEST book ever!!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|2|it is a dumb game, but maybe I don't have the patience.  I don't see what all the hype is about.
B00QR7ZN16|5|Excellent, excellent. Sonically it sounds like nothing that is played on the radio today.  It has a classic D'Angelo feel and sound.
B0000VCZKM|3|So much for special edition. Enough complaints have been made about the lack of widescreen format - unforgiveable in any musical since the dance numbers nearly always take up the whole screen.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that there are actually lines REMOVED from songs - in \\"The Hard Knock Life\\", Molly's orders to \\"Strip those beds! Scrub that floor!\\" have been erased, although there is still a camera close-up that clearly shows her mouthing the words. In \\"We've Got Annie,\\" a whole series of servants' exclamations are similarly gone. There are several other omissions that slip my mind currently. Why on earth would the editing team take out these lines? If they were going to remove anything, it might at least have been the two exclamations of \\"g-dd-mn\\" at the end, which are the only occasions of this movie turning un-kid-friendly and were entirely unnecessary. What were you thinking, Columbia?<br /><br />Get this movie by all means, but get the widescreen version. I don't know whether it shares the problem of ommitted lines, however, and until I do, I'll stick with my old much-loved VHS.
B00EHMFC78|5|I look forward to reading the books about Will Pobie.  They are always fast paced and for me exiting.  David Baldacci is a great writer who I I enjoy.
B000066C1N|5|daughter loves it.
B008G3N71W|5|Actress wants to be a star and will accept any kind of discipline to make it. Sound like Hollywood? If the censors look the other way, 'A Girl's Adventure' would make a unique movie with plenty of spanking, cropping, BDSM and pony play. This book is not vanilla, oh no, it is pure erotica and I loved it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1|I am bothered by the fact I am even reviewing or analyzing the film in any way.<br /><br />If I taught film I'd show this every semester and have the students rip it to shreds over and over, backdated to the begining of time.<br /><br />In the future we can't mask our smell and defeat blind aliens. This film lost me at hello. We use hand to hand combat to defeat Starship Trooper aliens? This film robbed Avatar which robbed everything. Plants would die if they froze every night? This film robbed the Batman and Robin utility belt/jumping the shark concept and took it to a new low.<br /><br />I think to even mention this film or approach it in any rational way only adds to the likelihood that someone might think is has some merit. It has zero merit and it's all rooted in the bad writing.<br /><br />This film is AWFUL. One of the worst in a long time.<br /><br />I'm not wasting too many words on this.<br /><br />After Earth with Will Smith and his son was one of the most awful films I've seen in a long time. The idea of a science fiction film with a father and son stranded on a hostile world is a great idea. It's gold in 2013, especially with the current level of filmmaking sophistication and special effects at any writers & directors disposal. You'd have to be 4 years old to mess up such a simply great idea and even then a 4 year old would likely do much better.<br /><br />Somehow M Night Shyamalan managed to implode this up beyond all wildest imagination. It was so bad I'm almost considering the possibility that he might just be intentionally thumbing his nose at Hollywood in some ironic way. I can't imagine any other reason this film could be cobbled together so poorly and with such little regard for logic, common sense, and science.<br /><br />All the film needed to do was have the two wake up on the hostile world and survive danger. If they wanted the plot point of the military father who finally comes to appreciate his son as a person, not a cadet, they could have added that in too. Just staying alive till help arrived could have been enough. And steer clear of Avatar type scenarios so you are not being redundant within recent film history. Almost any 2 people 2-3 days locked in a hotel room would have yielded a decent story. Any hack screenwriter could have then produced something of minor merit.<br /><br />This film is so far from mediocre and buried beneath 40 miles of waste that it is incredible it even exists.<br /><br />Then they add these insane plot points like a super futuristic ship crashes and only has 2 distress beacons that don't auto fire. No signal is sent out before, or during the crash?<br /><br />This film plays out like an old episode of batman where they have exactly what they need in their medical-pack. Then it breaks.<br /><br />This film makes me think they made it this bad on purpose. This is no other explanation.added that in too. Just staying alive till help arrived could have been enough.

B00BQXM558|5|my kid loves the games in this app. one of the better English learning apps ive seen.  not just flashcards but fun fun games.
0930289234|4|The reviews on back cover claim Watchmen legitimized the graphic novel as a form of literature, that couldn't be more accurate. Moore blends naturalism, a dark depiction of the human condition with multiple perspectives and multi-faceted personalities. He breaks down the stereotypical hero and twists the Watchmen into beings who have accomplished a great deal but also have tremendous faults. Not mention,  on top of Moore's writing, Gibbons contributes the perfect illustrations to compliment the text in variety of styles.
B008JMKN4Y|4|A friend told me to read this book and it was SO GOOD! I have recommended it to 5 people now, it is such a cute romantic book. But not too x rated. It is good for both adults and young adults to read and I HIGHLY suggest both to read it!
0670022411|5|I loved living their lives with them for three whole books! I'm going to miss them....
B007PTJOV0|4|I am not am avid gamer, however I have played Mario, Swampy, and a few others. This game is similar. I've played it for about 30 minutes and find it exciting, and possibly addicting. I rate it four and a half. Enjoy!
B00HBQWGXK|5|Big fan, amazing writer.  Love Jack Reacher.
B002MQYOFW|5|I liked that the book captured my attention from page one. I laughed and cried with every climax of each section of the book. This book is a story that every one can enjoy.
B003UAKE9Y|5|I visual masterpiece! It may be a little scarier for younger kids but they'll be all the better for it!
B001MTENOC|5|I don't know if I believe a word that Newton is saying but, at the very least, it's a creative book and it sparks the imagination. It challenges some of my traditional Christian beliefs but that's okay. It's a big universe and I like having my cage rattled. In other ways, it's very familiar in that we all have to work through our shortcomings, in order to grow, and that Our Source loves us.<br /><br />Having also greatly admired my Buddhist teacher, Michio Kushi, I can see how a lot of this book also harmonizes very well with his point of view. The necessity for some to return here, or to continue their learning on other planets, or the freedom of some to return Home, to dwell in Unity, only to spring out again at some future or past place/time, on yet another adventure.<br /><br />I find that I kinda skim through Newton's explanations because I'm anxious to get on to the next soul interview.
B000FC1AGG|5|i have never so hard from a book.. i read it in one night because i could not put it down. i seriously was laughing so hard i woke up my family. myabe because i have had some pretty embarrassing things happen to me i enjoyed it so much
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved the book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. highly recommended if you like mystery and drama.
B00000J2SQ|5|I love this cd! I think this is the best album by rainbow with Joe Lynn Turner. Ofcours, not the best of all Rainbow-albums, cause you can't top the Dio years. But it's certainly a good one! The album kickjs off with my favorite track of the whole album. Great guitarplay on the song and Joe Lynn Turner sings very well. The rest of the songs are very good too, but there all not as good as 'Dead Alley Driver'. My second favorite track on the album is 'Power'. Very good song, and my third-favorite song is 'Rock Fever'. The rest of the album is ofcours very good too, those three song were just the best of the album. So, I really recommend this album, it's a great album and the best of Joe Lynn Turners. If you want to spend your money on good music, then this is your change! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I hope this review was helpfull to you!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|The story was everything I've come to love about Grisham`s stories.  I am  a Mississippi native and have travelled the state.  I know it pretty well along with its history and people.  I love how the characters feel so familiar because I know people just like them (all of them.)  I love how John tells a story while weaving bits of history into the story.  I find myself almost holding my breath sometimes!  I love reading, but when I take the time for myself away from my family and other responsibilities, the story needs  to be worth it.  This story absolutely was.  I love the ending but wish the journey wasn't over.  Thanks for the updates on the characters from A Time to Kill.
B007SGLZP8|3|First 2/3 s of book were a bit tedious.  I was curious enough to read to the end. Essential plot was unique but prefer stories with more  action and suspense or romance.
B00092ZMDY|5|The \\"Eagles\\" are an all American band with exceptional talent.  They combind rock and country music where they have written all the songs and produced the \\"farewell\\" concert showing the talent of each individual band member.
B0031RAOVY|5|This is a wonderful true story.  It's well written, directed, and acted.
1451695195|5|The book was fascinating. He made perfect sense in everything he said in his book. It took me on  a magical journey as I was reading it! I highly recommend it!
B000VYX8PE|5|fun book
B00A6WSTIW|4|Action packed...decent char. actors  I liked it very much...and its possible too. Super sharks ....a word that scares the begees outa you...
B00BUCXVPI|4|This film is a bit of a brainless potboiler but is gets a four star rating because it has no long dragged out boring skin scenes and buckets of blood and guts hanging out slow motion crap.  The car chase requires you to suspend belief in reality or truly believe that GM makes all of their cars out of cast iron six inches thick. On the other hand I don't worry too much when Good old John Wayne gets smacked with a chair and the chair breaks.  This is a good popcorn flick to watch when it is rainy and you don't want to go out.
B00DR0PDNE|2|Very difficult to sync with smart tv.  Especially one that is programmed with a universal remote.
B00MU9R5OI|5|Be careful, this game is fun and addicting.
B000JMKTLO|4|With so many reviews alread postedy, there is not much I can add.  I do, however, want to add my two-cents in the recommendation of this book to fans of [[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]].  That was the book that introduced me to this author and I loved it (even found the ending to be perfectly fitting which many readers did not care for).  I then went it search of her other novels and downloaded this from my public library last week.<br /><br />My initial impression was that I didn't care for it as much as \\"Gone Girl\\" and early on it was more slow-moving, but I liked it well enough to keep going.  Somewhere around the half way point the pace picked up and the suspense started building.  By the end I was totally caught up in the story and didn't want to put it down.  I will warn readers that this is a dark book but not as violent as you sometimes find.  Most of the actual violence happens off-screen and the reader is exposed to the aftermath.  If you enjoy light and fluffy mysteries such as those in the cozy genre, this one may not be for you.<br /><br />While I didn't think the book was as good as \\"Gone Girl\\", it was still a strong, suspenseful novel.  I will be reading [[ASIN:B0027MJU00 Dark Places: A Novel]] soon.
B0089LOG02|4|the book was interesting and keep me reading,  enjoyed a taste of history.  confusing back and forth in time. One authors opinion that individual attention and take care of anger.
B00687Q0VC|4|Nice
B0009X766Y|4|I'm not sure what other people are saying about the widescreen format. however, there is no need for this material to be on two discs. disc two just has a documentary and some other stuff. there's not really enough bonus features. also, there's no feature commentary. boo!
B0000508U6|3|I kinda like this CD, and I know that I'm not supposed to listen to the lyrics of pop, but I think these guys had some kind of psychic trauma involving spiders.  Or maybe the spiders are just a metaphor for how many times the singer messes up and has to apologize through the medium of song.  (I guess it works since his audience keeps letting him mess up again and again.)<br />Maybe I'm missing the irony, but it seems to me that if more than 50% of the album is devoted to apologizing... well, people who just apologize all the time aren't very sincere.  <br />Other than that, the sound is pretty generic by the third track.  The songs are pretty, but there's not a whole lot of breadth here.... but for pop music, it's not too terrible.
B000W93CHC|4|Much better than the TV Series! I am a Ken Follett fan and found this a very enjoyable read. As always the characters are very well drawn. This novel has more characters than I could keep up with, but the story around the two main characters tracked well. Too much detailed sex keeps me from recommending it to Christian friends.
B000UIVRXG|5|if you like silly british and sophisticated fast moving plots you will most likely really dig this. its very tongue in cheek, and in my opinion even better than Shaun of the Dead
0141301066|5|A reader always wonders how many more masterpieces Roald Dahl would've created had he not died from leukemia in 1990 at age 74. This belovedly candid children's author, who writes in the intro, \\"Bring us a basin! We're going to be sick!\\" on parents who brag about the \\"brilliance of their own revolting offspring,\\" delights in meting out justice to characters with befittingly bad names such as Miss Trunchbull.<br /><br />When young Dahl himself was a lad of 8, according to a bio, he and four friends \\"were caned by the headmaster after putting a dead mouse in a jar of sweets in a sweet shop owned by a 'mean and loathsome' old woman called Mrs. Pratchett.\\"<br /><br />This could be a synopsis of his future books, where a tiny innocent child is pitted against a monstrous grownup who will eventually get his comeuppance due to the superior wisdom of the child and necessary allies met along the way.<br /><br />As an American adult, I love learning through Dahl about the UK, the language and customs, as well as the daft British sense of humor so well portrayed in BBC comedies.<br /><br />Delightfully unpredictable, this 240-page book was written toward the end of Dahl's prodigious writing career. A true genius in character study, plot and ambience, he keeps even the most sophisticated of readers surprised and delighted and laughing out loud at what the main character cooks up in her satisfying search for revenge. For more fun, click on Dahl's website RoaldDahl.com.

B004DI7HZ6|5|It is obvious some people did not read this book based on some of the comments. Excellent book.
B00C7607FS|5|I ordered this for my sister's birthday. The color is superb in this edition and it was really great to get to experience the movie with my 8 month old niece.
B000OVLINI|5|This was an excellent book. Well written, interesting characters, complex time and place. It is hard to put down. It obviously does not lose anything in translation.
0385720920|5|Like most of his fans, I was turned on to Chuck Palahniuk through Fight Club, the movie not the book.  I have seen it over 20 times, possibly over 30.  It was a masterpiece to be sure, and made me - like so many others - want to read the book.<br />So I did.<BR>And loved it.<BR>I wanted more.<br />So I went to my local library, looking to pick up another Palahniuk book, and Choke was the only one on the shelf - the rest were all checked out.  I opened it to the first page, and began reading it right there in the Om-Pl aisle of the fiction section.  Upon reading the \\"do not read this book\\" opening, I was hooked.  I could have stood there reading until the last page.  One thing you have to say about Chuck is that he knows how to catch your attention quick.<br />Less than twenty four hours later, I had finished Choke.  That was yesterday.  I have to admit, I puzzled over just what to make of it.  I unquestionably was entertained.  Hell, I could have kept reading through an earthquake.  But, I wasn't sure what Chucky was trying to tell us, what his message was, what we should learn from Victor Mancini.  If anything.  What could you learn from a sex-addicted man whose mother is in an insane asylum, whose best friend is a sex-addict that collects rocks to keep from masturbating?  A man who goes to restaurants and pretends to choke in order to make money and who may or may not be the Lord and Savior?<br />Plenty, as it turns out.  I won't tell you what my take on this is, because it will not be the same for you.  As in Fight Club, everyone sees a different moral to the story.  Some will see none, no redeeming qualities.  It's up to you.<br />Just ask yourself:  What would Jesus NOT do?
B0012EJWNY|5|DON'T KNOW WHY IT HAS TAKEN SO LONG FOR ME TO ADD DREAM THEATER TO MY FAVORITE MUSIC.....THEY SURE ARE GONNA GET ALOT OF SPACE IN THE CLOUD PLAYER NOW. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO SEE DREAM THEATER 'LIVE' SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY PUT OUT OUTSTANDING MUSIC AND AN UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE.........THOUGH SOMEHOW,  DUH ! , I FORGOT I COULD BRING THE 'EXPERIENCE' HOME.
B0094K1MH2|5|Very very well done. I don't watch a lot of animated movies these days, but this one was pretty extraordinary. Its much more realistic looking than most animated movies, but they did well! Sometimes you almost wonder if there's some live actors in it.
B00HWWDV5A|3|I sold this. I was up for more movement from George. No the case with the lethargic music on this CD. I guess I will always love his WHAM days.
B0083Z614S|5|I think this belongs in a school for libraries or book reports. I loved it but at first it started off real cheesy.<br />thank you for making the best book
B008QTV3X0|5|A combination of a great timely story line and superb acting.  I became addicted in the first episode and am anxiously awaiting season 3.
B007ADIRDM|5|I bought this for my niece last 2012 Christmas. She was looking for Monster High dolls!  as i remember, i got the shipment very promptly.  The niece is very satisfied!

B000MRAAJW|5|Excellent Work!!!  Awesome pictures and the only TRUE way to enjoy it is in FULL HD.
0780619587|5|As a pianist, physician, and writer, I watched this film with great anticipation. It more than met my expectations. The portrayal of David was moving, heart-breaking, and, finally, rewarding. The acting was superb. The screenplay, including the plot device of the domineering, over-protective father fatally flawed by the Holocaust, all fit together. The redemption relationship at the end--perfect. I don't know exactly how closely all this parallels the true story, but the film was wonderful. The music was sublime, too.
068485015X|5|For all the folks debating on Dr.Peck's moral standing.......<br /><br />In this book Dr. Peck makes observations about human nature from professional experience.<br /><br />The only thing that matters is whether it’s the TRUTH or not.<br />If it’s TRUE (or if it sounds TRUE to your best reasoning), then you are **obviously**  better off to accept and follow it, even if Dr P is a fraud, sinner or a red sox fan.<br />If it is FALSE, then you are better off ignoring it even if Dr. P is the greatest saint of our times.
B00QR7ZM8A|1|Bob Dylan has NEVER been a good singer, but we never cared about that.  His value was and is that he's one of the great songwriters of our lifetime.  Here he covers ten 50+ year old standards, many of which were originally done by Frank Sinatra.  No Dylan originals here.  So...take his songwriting genius out of the equation and all you have are his vocals, which are NOT improving with age.  He sounds like a drunk at last call hunched over a bar attempting to croon.  This CD is utterly worthless.
B005544TRQ|5|Enjoyable, I watched all the free episodes.
B003AMAOW4|4|Music and voices the best.<br />cenário, dress, they are modern , no good.
B007J4T2G8|1|Was this book written by a 5th grader? I was trying to force myself to finish it because i paid for it, but it was way too bad. Wish i could have given it less than 1 star!!!
B009Z5BPZK|4|They ended it the typical way wish it would have went on longer though. I figured out who GG was in season 5 they hint to it a lot.
B00IF943GA|1|It would be fun if it worked.
B00499NHLC|5|Benedict Cumberbatch is absolutely fantastic. Moffat definitely knew what he was doing when he chose him. I cannot wait for season 4 to come out!
B0051ANPZQ|4|This is a great book to show friendship and the challenges of being the new kid. Everyone should read it.
B00005Y228|5|This is one of the best CD i'ev ever heard! CCYOOMH is an absolute success and songs like 'In Your Eyes' and 'More more more' are simply irresistable. This should one of Kylie's best work.It's definitely worth a buy.

B003X2O6KW|2|Kayne West is the type of Artist that already going in that his musical Opinion of his talents and the actuality are night and day. on one hand he has some cleaver Arrangements that lend themsselves to his word play and Swagger play on words, on the other hand he comes up empty at times trying to get a particular point across and he will either sink or Swim depending on how stretched out said track is.  unlike previous albums there isn't a lead single or a standout hit song here and that for better or for worse keeps this journey of this album going.<br /><br />his biggest problem as a artist is thinking he has topped what he has already done,when in fact he is a strickly by the singles type of act. he has been able to blend styles and have moments and yet never quite finish what e starts. this album is a continue true to form formula he has used as his blue print.musically as a artist he wants to be vulnerable and yet maintain that swagger which while has it's place, simply isn't enough to a compelling album.  he migh have a legit greatest hits package but as far as  a studio album he continues to step over his own creations.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved this book it was my favorite of the hunger games series.  Action packed and very suprising. I was very impressed!! My favorite book!!
B002EWD0I6|5|I was hooked on this series from Episode 1. My review for Season 3 applies to Season 1 as well. Loved the characters, plots and scenery!
B004JN1D2I|1|I have read these books before and they are great but shouldn't the Kindle Edition be cheaper in price than the physical books?  That is, after all, why most people got the kindle.  Well that and not having enough shelf space for our books. However, I think you could cut the price by half for the kindle version since there isn't any over head.  I expect better Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5|Absolutely in love with this book. I couldn't put it down. Never thought I'd like the series but I can't wait to read the next 2 books.
B00ANY7V8M|5|I purchased this for my 12 year old daughter.  She has started to collect the Lego Friends sets.  She is a cat lover so when she saw this one online she had to have it. I just wish that Legos in general weren't so expensive.
B00AA7O22U|5|We loved the first one but the second was even better.  Would highly recommend this movie.  Has a few suprises.
B008JGSM6G|4|Really good to play when you're bored and want something that requires thinking, however minimal it may be. It's fun.
B00J1IQUYM|4|Well written, the characters lives tied together well in quite unique ways
B00447G2PM|5|This was a great 3D movie. It looks like you are under the sea with the fish. The only downside was the length of the film. It sucks shelling put twenty bucks(thats what I paid for it at best buy) for a 40 min movie, but if you are looking for a quality 3D movie, then its worth it
B006GWO5NE|5|Works great
B0015RFCZ0|5|All sound good movie. Can be shown anywhere. Feel good ending.
B00AIBZJS4|4|This Bluray Disc is Region Free, but the DVD copy is Region A/1.  I don't know why Amazon.US will not put this information on their web site. I am in New Zealand where our region is B/2,and the Bluray Disc plays perfectly alright, and as I have said the DVD copy is region A/1 so you would need a multi DVD player for the DVD. I found out this product information through HD Movie Source where it says US Manufactured Disc, Region A B C.

B0027BOL4G|5|We all think our food comes from large green farms where cows happily moo and chew grass in the fields and pigs and chickens forage in the high grass. WRONG. This documentary shows how our food is really mass produced and has become a mechanized industry based on profit, not nutrition. Animals are kept in horrible conditions, fed rbgh growth hormone and antibiotics in their GMO corn, milk cows are forced to produce more milk causing mastitis which puts pus in the milk (which is allowed at &#34;acceptable levels&#34;) and how animals are turned into food. It also shows how crops are genetically modified (GMO) and sold to us to eat when there have been studies that show that they cause cancer, birth defects, disease, etc. This is a very eye opening documentary. Watch and learn and become proactive. Tell Monsanto and the food industry that we don't want GMOs in our meat or produce. Know what you are eating. Cancer rates and autism cases have skyrocketed in the last 10 years. Why? Could it be all the unsafe, unhealthy additives (chemicals) they are putting in our food? The food we are feeding our children? Knowledge is power people!

B009HUB40Y|5|Alertness and speed required ! Great graphics, good explanation of various enhancements. Sure requires focus and planning.. I enjoy it til I run out of lives..
B00FZM8Z7I|4|The movie was pretty good, but not stellar. I'm kind of a Kristen Bell fan so it was fun to hear her sing. She's also really funny.<br />For as much as I love Wicked, Idina's part didn't thrill me. But Olaf stole the show by far!<br />The 3D was nice but I was hoping for more out of the screen stuff after I saw someone's comment that said &#34;it's snowing in my family room&#34;

B000009ED0|5|When Kid Rock showed up on the MTV radar in early 1998, plenty of people didn't know what to think. Is he rock? Country? Metal? Rap?<br />Yes! He's every one of those things plus more. Kid Rock and the Twisted Brown Trucker Band weave a half dozen musical gendre's into an excellent package. Citing everyone from Metallica, NWA, and Hank Williams as major influences, Kid Rock is at times obscene, and at times heart-wretching. <br />Every track on the CD is a winner, but here is the best of the best.<br />Bawitdaba: 9/10  This song is a huge, powerful, arena ANTHEM!!! Probably Kid's most recognizable song, it has pointless lyrics and a heavy, shout along chorus.<br />Cowboy: 8/10  A laid back, western flavored song. Funny video.<br />I Am The Bullgod: 9/10  This was the first single, it's catchy and fun, but like most of Kid Rocks songs, is just one long rant about himself.<br />Devil Without A Cause: 9/10  Pretty much just a rap song with a heavy chorus, I love the intro. Kid Rocks sidekick Joe C. co-stars on this one.<br />Wasting Time: 8/10  A good song, just something to kick back too.<br />F*ck Off!: 8/10 A very hard rap metal track, filled with curses, and co-starring the best rapper out there, Kid Rocks friend from Detroit, Eminem!<br />Only God Knows Why: 10/10  Best track on the CD, a heart warming power ballet. Something Kid Rock tried to do eight times on his next full length disc, \\"Cocky\\"<br />All in all, this is a tough CD to top, hope Kid Rocks 3rd CD can do better than the second.
0470449748|4|This is the real Holy Grail of GMAT. Even if you are not a fan of official books, you must have this one.  Not many questions are challenging for a 700+ score and you should get a different book to help teach the concepts. Some of the Math instructions simply have example problems. I'd rather learn the \\"why\\" over learning the \\"how\\".  GMAC offers online courses (some free) which use this book as well. So it is a must-have for studying.   I've only been studying for a little over a week, but so far I am happy.  Overall a good book, but not something you can rely on solely.
B00005OCMR|5|Back in its time in the mid 19880s this film was awsome one of the most comnfiscated and most expensive Disney Movie every made. Today it's even better a classic film. Before the release of Chrnonicles Narnina and newer Disney films. When and ex computer executive tries to hack into the computer to prove that his boss stole credits for video games that he designed, he is thrown into and adventure that rivals that of the Digmom movie.

B008KW43TE|2|I really cant see what all the hype is about with Frank Ocean. This cd was not at all what I expect and to me it really wasnt all that good. Of course they were songs on here that I could listen to over and over but as a whole I really wished I wouldnt have wasted my money.
B00FAPF5U0|4|I love this game its very addicting.  I'm so glad they made it for my kindle.  Now I can play on my phone and my kindle.

B000002UDB|5|This album rocked and roll, I tell you what.  It echoed the Sgt. Pepper album, but it wasn't as strong as Pepper was.  Some of the song just dragged on.  I couldn't dig it.  Sgt. only had one that dragged on (Within  you Without you).  I rank it 3 place in my polls of the Beatles albums  (Sgt. Pepper, White Album)
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game reminds me of the old Atari game forever. I enjoyed this game so much. Super addicting. My favorite character is the snail! What's yours?
B005ZOBNOI|4|Bring the tissues!
B004YEJGEO|4|i tried this game. i like the concept but seems like the controls are abit off. i would touch dead center in the circle of the item and instead moving in place it would spin. idk if thats just how it is on my phone or not but thats what happened. 5 star for concept,minus one for that. as for the people that paid....i guess you rated your stupidity but i think you rated too high. and to those that said charge more, dont be stupid telling someone to charge more is like telling the gas company to charge $10 instead of $4. these are hard times
B002KQ6BT6|5|If you're just looking for entertainment, this is the best you can get. Won't get you thinking though
B004H4XDBI|5|Read this book. It's great for teens and adults. Can't wait for the movie to come out.  I fell in love.

B000SEFNMS|4|I've been a fan for some time of Krakauer's writing and was eager to read this prior to the movie coming out. Like Krakauer's other books, this details a life on the fringes; the primary difference I see though is in this Krakauer seems to almost be rooting for his subject. A fun read, however tragic, that taps into the side of us that longs to be free, and the unfortunate short-sightedness that we sometimes fall to while chasing our dreams.
1451636016|5|In the time you're spending reading these reviews you could be reading the free first chapter and you would already know for yourself how good this new book really is.
B0017SWPXY|5|I was hesitant to read this because I didn't want to get sucked into another Marley & Me sob story, but this book is different. It's sweet, witty, and touching with an ending that is happy and beautiful. I admit that I skipped over the more detailed racing descriptions because...well, I just don't care about that, but the main story was great. I recommend this book to people all of the time now.

B00DJFIMW6|5|I first thought this was a game for just kids, But call me a big kid cause I  can't won't stop
B003XF1XOQ|5|Really held my interest. I will read them all again. Love the movies too!  Held pretty true to the books.
1594202842|4|First off, I have to praise Amy Chua for having written this book and publishing it to the world! Because as a Chinese (American) myself, heck we sure like to keep all these parenting stuff a secret. Why? Well, for one thing...we just don't share a lot. We're a tight lip culture.    This is not a book about how to raise YOUR kids. Read it with a light heart!    This book is about her experiences raising two kiddos and sustaining a family. Thru triuphs and tribulations, she explored the ideal but tough ways to raise both her kids the traditional Chinese way. It's not a brag book (although I felt so at the first couple of chapters). I think Chua has a lot to brag about having come so far and having achieved so much..but it was not handed to her. So, she wants the same for her kids. Is that bad? No! But read on because everything in life doesn't always happen as planned.    Many of my friends who were also born to immigrant Chinese parents are outrageously successful as doctors, lawyers, etc...if I were them, I'd brag. You started at ground zero and despite soooo many hurdles were able to be successful! But more importantly, we want this for our kids, too. We want them to succeed but more importantly to have more than any means to take care of themselves. And we naturally teach them what our parents have taught us, That's not wrong, right? How many Chinese kids are at top rated schools in the US. I know that a local, prestigious high school in SF actually raised their testing scores for Chinese kids admission only to create a diverse multi-racial environment. There were just too many Chinese kids in the school. But, how do they do it? Why is it that Chinese families are churning out more academically advanced kids?      Anyways, I'd recommend this book because it would be a great topic for book clubs, parenting forums, friends and family, plus...your children. I think Amy opened the door for Asians in America with her writing this. We're always the model minority ... but ever think where that stemmed from?
B00DRPVE3M|5|I love uno. This is working well on my kindle fire HD. I like interactive games. It's easy play and seems pretty reasonable to play without paying if you only use it a few rounds a day. Commercials are annoying, but hey it's free.

B000W7JWUA|5|My family purchased this a while back and we play it religiously.  When I went off to college at the Naval Academy, I could think of no better gift for my sponsor family/host family than this gift.  Hope to get many more great hours out of this game.

0446567337|1|Okay for all of you who say you \\"don't want to spoil the book\\" for others, the title already tells you what's going to happen. A \\"Dear John\\" letter is how people refer to a letter that someone writes to break up with someone!  If you love someone the way John and Savannah did WHY would you choose to marry someone else? And you choose the cowardly way to tell him through a letter?  John derserved better than that.  Also, just because John was in the army does not mean you can't get married!  I married my husband when he was in the Army.  Duh!  Also, did anyone else notice that Mr. Sparks repeated verbatim phrases from The Notebook????  i.e. She asks \\"What do you remember the most? his answer \\"All of it.\\"  I KNOW that Allie asked the same question of Noah.  That's it, let's just regurgitate what worked the first time.      I was thrilled that John did not end up with Savannah.  In my mind, John learned what unconditional love was from his relationship with Savannah, but he went on to love another who was much better suited for him and much more deserving of his love.  Thanks Savannah!    I will not be reading anymore of Nicholas Sparks books!  Yuck!
B003IKMR0U|5|This is an easy, fun game that both my 7 year-old and my husband & I enjoy.  The premise is basic, and it's quick/easy to learn.  And it's not as scary or morbid as the packaging suggests.  We often include it in our Family Game Nights because it can go quickly, and is fun to play more than once in a row.  A great addition to your game collection!
B0031YJFCQ|3|Harder to read than the first two. I LOVED the story but got tired of the insane amount if background that was given about minor char... it slowed down the story.
B005HSG3TC|5|Love the cover. Sturdy, but not too bulky and hard. Will use it everyday. Good value. It was a great gift.
0307352153|5|Haven't been impacted this strongly by a book in a long time. Learned so much about myself -- things that have baffled me all my life. I now know better about the WHY, and also how I can channel some of my traits and strengths and not feel guilty when I want to leave a social setting, for example, and just be alone. If it's true that one-third to one-half of us are really introverts, I completely agree with the comment that for at least half of us, this book should be required reading. Or at least watch Susan Cain's TED Talk about it on YouTube.
B000002GB9|5|One of their best
B00004W3L3|5|\\"Misplaced Childhood\\" is Marillion's third album, originally released in 1985. It's a concept album, and every track is special, I think.    Marillion are a neo-prog rock band, one of the 1980s groups who were really inspired by the sounds of classic progressive rock. Their sound is probably closest to \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\" era Genesis, I think. \\"Lord of the Backstage\\" on Misplaced Childhood sounds a little like a cheerier \\"Lost in NYC\\", for instance. The production though, is understandably more 1980s though. Marillion's lead singer, Fish, sounds a lot like Peter Gabriel in his angrier, charged moments, actually. It's not like the similarity comes out of impersonation, well I don't think so. Fish is definitely singing from the heart, and the tone of his voice seems to come pretty natural to him. He's Scottish, and during the spoken word parts of the album (like the start of \\"Bitter Suite\\") you can hear his accent. When he starts singing again though his accent quickly disappears. The contrast is a little weird, but it doesn't really matter.    The album is one continuous piece of music. That's not to say it's on long song. It's more like the tracks change in time with the rhythm, if that makes sense, so as one song ends, you are thrown into the next one on the next beat. While a couple of tracks (\\"Psuedo Silk Kimono\\",\\"Blind Curve\\",etc) work best in the context of the album, most of the tracks make good stand alone tunes. \\"Kayleigh\\" was actually a hit single in England, in fact, while the name Kayleigh went on to be really popular in Britain thanks to this song. I looked on Marillion's myspace site, and there are lots of girls named Kayleigh wanting to be their friend. Kind of funny.    There's a couple of themes running through this concept album. There's the breakup of Fish's longtime girlfriend and his desire to write a song for her, there's the haunting presence of a child-like figure, and the intense experience of life on the road and in the public eye. In \\"Childhood's End\\", one of my favorite tracks, Fish (or the character he portrays) realizes that all the joys of childhood are still there in his heart, and no breakup or touring is going to steal it from him if he doesn't want it to. He says to himself, regarding his ex, \\"she's got to carry on with her life/and you've got to carry on with yours\\", then with the final song \\"White Feather\\" encourages the listener, more or less, to be true to themselves. I'm not sure if this was how the concept was meant to be, but that's what I get out of it.    The booklet of the remaster's fairly good. It contains liner notes by Mark Wilkinson (who drew the cover of the album) describing the making of both the album and of the cover. There are also lyrics, and pictures of the sleeves of the singles, which go along with the themes of both the album and the cover artwork.    Overall, it's a great concept album, a great 1980s group, and a good addition to any prog rock collection. A lot of progressive rock fans, when suggesting Marillion albums to newcomers, often say \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\", their first album. Though there's some great tunes on that album, I'd say this one would be a little better to start with. It was for me, for quite a few reasons. Every track is quality, the lyrics are particularly thoughtful, and it contains Marillion's biggest hit. Definitely worth a listen. Recommended.

B0041T52S6|2|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />For those who have been trying to figure out which media influenced the scenarists of 'Scott Pilgrim', how about MTV, old 80s video games, comic books and Quentin Tarrantino? There's one other that may only occur to the older population watching this film: Batman, the 60s TV show. Remember all the zany titles which would appear whenever something dramatic happened (titles such as \\"Sock!\\", \\"Pow!\\", \\"Bong!\\")? A similar technique is employed here with Scott Pilgrim but the titles are often inserted for a more farcical comic book effect (for example, when a phone rings, the title \\"ring\\" zips across the screen). One or two word titles are also utilized to describe each character (so if the narrator mentions someone is 'clueless', it's also mentioned again as a title description). 'Pilgrim' wins points for its original visual style, featuring nifty camera work and spectacular special effects which often makes one feel as if one is inside of a crazy video game.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Pilgrim's story is as bland as the title character. Michael Cera (playing another geeky role) is awful as a 22 year old garage band musician who first dates a perky high school student (\\"Knives Chau\\") but then dumps her for the more mysterious Ramona Flowers (winningly played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Cera's Pilgrim can do nothing more than act like a love sick puppy dog opposite the much more aggressive Flowers from beginning to end.<br /><br />In real life, the enigmatic Flowers would never go for the wimpy Pilgrim who always seems to be kow-towing to her during their many platonic interactions. Somehow, Flowers decides to give Pilgrim a second chance after he defeats her 7th ex-boyfriend Gideon (Pilgrim's ex-bands' new sponsor) in a long-winded fight scene (Flowers is not really 'attracted' to boyfriend #7; actually, he's planted a micro-chip in her brain causing her to fall for him!).<br /><br />That's basically the crux of the Pilgrim plot--our 'hero' must go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation. The seven confrontations (which include a woman, one of Ramona's bi-flings) are nothing more than a device to stage a series of silly fight scenes reminiscent of Tarrantino's stylized sword fights in \\"Kill Bill\\". None of it makes any sense, especially when perky and cute Knives attacks Ramona out of jealousy over her relationship with Pilgrim. Should I also mention that Pilgrim is stabbed to death, goes to limbo but discovers he has an \\"extra life\\" that enables him to return to earth so he can do battle with Gideon all over again.<br /><br />None of the supporting players exhibit any charm. Pilgrim's gay roommate, for example, puts Pilgrim down when he advises Knives not to get involved with him during their first meet up. And then there's Pilgrim's drummer and ex-girlfriend Kim Pine; why exactly does she have a dour expression on her face throughout the film? There's also little humor in the film--one attempt (if you can call it that) occurs with Ramona's third ex, Todd; he's stymied when he's stripped of his 'vegan psychic' powers by the 'vegan police' who have discovered that he's been putting half and half (non-vegan milk substitute) in his coffee.<br /><br />In the end, one can only conclude that 'Pilgrim' is a pointless endeavor. Should we regard 'Pilgrim' as an honorable character after he engages in these violent confrontations with a group of one-dimensional, comic book villains? Even worse is how emasculated Pilgrim comes off as he is led around on a leash by a much more hip Ramona. This is a film strictly for teenagers. Its failure to appeal to an older, more sophisticated crowd spelled doom at the box office in the American market.go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation.

B000063JZQ|5|This movie is pretty on-point to the play.  My students enjoyed it, and the odd bits of nudity (child bathing, witches) were contextual, not sexual.
B00003CXN4|2|I hate to pan this one, because this country desparately needs a scathing denouncement of the war on drugs that will bypass the politicians, and get into the mainstream consciousness. Unfortunately, Traffic isn't it. In a frantic effort to pack the entire tragic tapestry of the drug war into a two hour movie, Traffic accomplishes absolutely nothing. Most of the movie's content seems to be drawn from a collage of real life events over past years. I recall many actual news stories which are very similar to the plot points of of this movie. All of the drug war players are here. The junkie, the dealer, the cop, the corrupt officials, the honest but naive drug warriors. But the topic is so large, and the time so limited, they're like the chorus from a classical Greek play. They take the stage, deliver the lines which represent their point of view, and dutifully troop off. A long novel might have done justice to this story. But in a feature length movie, it's nothing more than cliched, inflammatory stereotypes and ham fisted preaching. In addition, the movie is intentionally shot in an off-color, jerking &quot;point of view&quot; style that's not much more graceful than the efforts of an amateur with a camcorder. I suppose this was meant to lend a tense &quot;you are there&quot; kind of feel. The only tension I felt was between my temples.
B000JK8OYU|5|Really good album. I saw the show at Vegas and wanted the album. If anyone happens to go to Vegas I recommend seeing the show.
B000929AJQ|2|I honestly wasnt expecting much from \\"with teeth\\" after hearing rumors and specualation, and quite frankly what could you really follow up a masterpeice like \\"the fragile\\" with?  Well I didnt get much either.  This album has some serious flaws glaring on its slick surface.  The 3 and a half minute pop ditties on this record dont fit anywhere into the NIN we all know and love.  Honestly its like Trent died and they got some look alike to make another album unbeknownst to his fans. I see a trend coming,...that being a bunch of bad albums from this once shining light in music. NIN fans will defend this album to the hilt but of course thats there right.  If you like it for what it is fine but DO NOT expect anything approaching a masterpiece.  Maybe Its time for TR to hang up the black clothing and computers and call it a day...........
B004RJMUJO|4|It was fun to try and beat 7year old's score. I think that it could use some more levels. Cause she was board after a few turns.
B00K0MM4AM|4|Would you enter a car with Scarlett Johansson ?  Most men and a few women would.  And that little journey will take you to a trance induced place.  I loved the handling of this movie and it's exotic location enhanced by the accents of the denizens making them as &#34;other&#34; as it is for Scarlett.  It is a thriller in that it invokes the uncertainty of outcome .  Most eerie storytelling, not your obvious gothic.  Try it and stick with it.
B006IGZWB2|5|One of the best movies of this century. An honest depiction of African American maids in the 60's. Historically accurate and a great watch.
B007PTJOV0|4|this is a nice game but it is almost the same thing as Mario but I still like it and its not boring
B0089EHWQE|5|I can't say enough about this book - I so enjoyed it that I hated t to end!<br />The writer kept me hoping it might end differently.
B00881VLCE|5|Gorgeous photos that take you all over the world and let you experience things hitherto only witnessed in the imagination.
B00DMCV7K0|4|I enjoyed it - and the fact that it was loosely based on actual people makes it all the more compelling.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5|If you don't like Bruno mars, you are from mars, easy one of the best singers to grace the music industry, great great great CD!!
158270208X|5|It's more like a journal for me. It really has the look and feel of a book of magical secrets. Childish I know, if it should be altered at all it only should be adding additional pages.
B000O8OTNC|5|Light, compact, with great sharpener qualities.
B005URRCNQ|5|Ok
0805047905|4|Outr son really enjoys the story's and most of all the pictures, he is now dictating to us his questions and answers, we are all happy.
0007466064|5|Well, what can I say? I've read all books in the saga and even saw 2 HBO serials, which are based on this epic and very well done. I love this saga and my only concern is that this books contain too many secondary characters  and as result it's not easy to follow the events. Still I was very happy that two important women: Lady knight and Lady Catelyn are still alive despite their wounds and hopefully will get some peace which both of them need. Very interesting that kind princess who was able to raise the dragons can't govern her kingdom the way she wants to, despite her popularity and loyal servants. Her Right needs Might, but she can't obtain the<br />powerful friends, because she can't compromise her principals... I am rooting also for John Snow and his two sisters to get back their kingdom and join their younger brothers and mother. Waiting for the next book with a passion!
B00004ZAV3|4|Yet ANOTHER Beatles collection, this time of their &quot;number ones&quot; (that explains all the media genuflecting that took place in November).  Still, for introducing the Fab Four to BSB/Britney/'N Sync lovin' young'uns. &quot;1&quot; can't be beat.  Diehards are no doubt squabbling over the selection of songs, but the collection, which starts with the nursery rhyme cadences of &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; and finishes up with the gorgeous &quot;The Long And Winding Road,&quot; will have kids questioning their parents (and in my case, a Gen-X'er questioning her Baby Boomer husband) about the impact John, Paul, George and Ringo had on modern pop.  All of these songs are familiar singalongs, and the sound quality will have casual fans enjoying new nuances to old favorites--and maybe exploring the Beatles' catalog a bit further.
B0086700CM|5|Addictive very addictive I enjoy this game. I find myself playing it a lot and for long periods. its a must have!
1559942401|5|Owl At Home is the only Owl book that Lobel produced.  Composed of five delightful tales, children will be delighted at the antics of owl and his misunderstandings!<br />In the story, The Guest, Owl invites winter into his home with all of her fury!  Snow is everywhere and his pea soup becomes frozen.  Shooing winter out the door, winter closes the door with a bang and Owl settles down once his fire is lit and warmth seeps back into this home.  His soup thaws and Owl is once again contented!<br />Strange Bumps is hysterical as Owl tries to figure out why there are two bumps at the end of his bed, under his covers!  Owls gyrations under the bed and under the covers are guaranteed to bring many laughs!  Owl cannot figure out where they came from or why they will not leave.  He finally settles into his easy chair in front of the fire to get a good nights sleep!<br />Tear-Water Tea is delightful as we see Owl cooking is favorite tear-water tea with his own tears.  He thinks of all the sad things he can, such as mornings nobody saw because everybody was sleeping and pencils that are too short to use.  Filling up his kettle with his tears, he is ready to enjoy his favorite tea!  A tad bit salty for me though.<br />Upstairs and Downstairs depicts Owl running up and down his stairs to check on how the upstairs is doing and how the downstairs is doing.  Owl does this all day long and into the evening and he discovers how tired he is and he cannot be in two places at once!<br />Owl and the Moon is a cute tale of Owl befriending the Moon.  Owl knows that the Moon cannot fit through his door, and it saddens him that the Moon, his friend, cannot come into his house.  Getting ready for bed, Owl notices that Moon is shining outside and has indeed followed him home.  Going to sleep, Owl is no longer sad, as his friend is right outside his door.<br />Another wonderful Lobel, which is sure to delight and please readers young and old alike!  I wish that Lobel had written more books on Owl!!more books on Owl!!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great twists and turns!!!<br />I just kept reading to find out &#34; who did it&#34;.
B0018QQQK8|4|I'm not usually much of a love story person but I have to say, this book was AWESOME!!!  I could not put it down.
B008UCJ7KO|1|This book was very disappointing considering it is from an established author with a publisher. This is something I would expect to pay $.99 for from a self published author. Not only was the book expensive but it was complete crap! I cannot believe a successful, established and anticipated author would put their name to this garbage. Below are just a few reasons why but I could have gone on for pages!<br /><br />After three books we all get it, E + G have great sex, so why keep dragging it out. Yeah, it's a romance so I expect some sex but really the first half of the book was nothing but sex, there was no story or plot development at all.<br /><br />Then, once you finally get to some plot it was all over the place. She introduced way too many story lines that are completely irrelevant. Not that I don't care about the other characters but the main focus of the novel should be E + G and she really loses sight of that in this book. There wasn't much in this story that added to Eva and Gideon's relationship and what little there was was horribly done. The whole second half of the book was about everyone else's drama. No one cares about Corinne. That was the worst filler possible and shouldn't have been in there at all. SPOILER: Why would they have the whole part of him getting arrested only to have him fly to Cali to save her from a sex tape scandal? SO STUPID!<br /><br />Did anyone else get tired of the constant \\"I love you\\", \\"You're mine\\", \\"I need you crap\\"?? I mean we get it!! He killed for her, I think he has established he loves you, Eva. Sylvia turned her into such a desperate and needy character which she was a little before but it  was way worse in this book.<br /><br />I'm sad to be giving it one star because I was expecting something epic but this was a complete and total fail!
B006LSZECO|4|Interesting read about 2 people who need each other in a dark way.  Do they love each other . . . I think not!  I need to follow up with a wholesome family novel to lighten the mood after reading this book..
B00005JO9J|5|I love the first season. It's the beginning of it all. It's great to go back and see them all before their lives changed at Seattle Grace. I love their energy and enthusiasm.
B004SOR4H6|3|Hoped to find out info on season 6 and what direction they may take the show and the main characters. How it goes will decide for me as to whether I go or stay as a viewer.
B008FSCNTK|4|Missed this when it was released. Enjoyed the entire songbook
B0071XO8RA|5|I rarely write reviews, although I appreciate the time others spend giving me good insights into their book lists, but I had to add to the chorus about WOOL.  I was a bit skeptical about a self-published book but downloaded it because of the enthusiastic reviews.  It's a great sci-fi, dystopian future read with strong, multi-faceted characters and a surprising plot.  Much more than I expected!  If it was self-published because the standard publishing houses weren't interested, this will be their loss.  Hugh Howey's going to go a long way with this one!  And I'll be checking Amazon's list for his other work.
034580404X|1|If this trilogy were meant to be a serious work of fiction, written to portray life inside a dangerous relationship, and how to come out of it healthy and intact, I could overlook the terrible writing style, but it isn't. This story is intended to glorify mental, emotional and physical abuse.  Anastasia Steele is a 22 year old virgin who is days away from graduating from college when she meets Christian Gray.  Ana has a weak personality and serious self esteem issues and absolutely no serviceable life skills.  In spite of being a fourth year English literature major on the cusp of college graduation, she doesn't own a computer, an ipod or even have an e-mail account, and, apparently, she has never had a real boyfriend. I'm not sure how an English Lit major made it through four years of college without having a computer or an e-mail account, but that's our girl.  Then....She meets Christian Gray, a \\"self made bazillionaire who is only a few years older than she is. Mr. Gray is quite proud of the fact that he has gotten where he is financially by being a bastard...an overbearing, controlling bastard.  Christian is instantly attracted to this lovely young thing who thinks she is mousy and unattractive.  His control freak radar goes berserk, and he instantly zeroes in on his target.  Since Ana is such an innocent little lamb, she is obviously too naive to see that she is about to be led to slaughter. Naturally, because she has absolutely no self esteem, she is flattered by this handsome, rich and powerful man's attention.  Although she is wise enough to know that something about the way he stalks her is a bit off, she is, none the less flattered by the attention that she doesn't think she is worthy of...  Aaawww.....isn't that cute? No, it's not cute. It's sad. It is also hokey and unbelievable, but it's still sad.  FIRST: HE STALKS HER: How romantic is it that he shows up at her place of employment (a hardware store that is only a three hour drive from where he lives),he shows up at the bar where she is having drinks with friends, he shows up at her mothers house, he even direct deposits money into her checking account....all without ever being given any information or without being told where any of these places are, or, for that matter, that she would even be at any of these places. This man even buys the company that she eventually goes to work for so that he can control her every move. (remember that she has, at no time, provided any information to him telling him where she lives, banks, works or dines, yet he knows everything there is to know about her, and every move she makes. He accesses her checking account? Romantic? No. He is a stalker. Stalking is illegal, not romantic.  THEN HE THREATENS HER: Isn't it sexy how he tells her that he wants to beat her so badly that she won't be able to sit for a week? Why does he want to beat her so severely? Because she went out for drinks with her friends..keep in mind, these two are not even dating at this point. He does actually beat her with a belt because she \\"defied him\\", and he tells her, frequently, that he wants to hurt her. He does frequently hurt her, because she does so many things to make him angry, that he honestly believes he has the right to punish her. This behavior is not sexy. It is abusive and it is illegal, not sexy.  AND HE CONTROLS HER. Isn't it sweet how he is continuously badgering her to become his submissive? He really want's her to sign his \\"contract\\" that pretty much states that he is in total control. That she has no rights and her needs and feelings don't count.  She even has to get his permission to get out of the \\"contract\\" should she sign it.  A contract that says that he is legally allowed to do whatever he chooses to her, and she is not allowed to tell anyone, for fear of severe punishment. He tells her that she is not allowed to talk to her friends about their relationship, that she is not allowed to visit her mother, This isn't sweet and endearing. It is frightening.  BUT MOSTLY, HE ABUSES HER. Bruises are a sure sign of true love, right?  This man deliberately hurts her during her first sexual encounter, telling her that he wants her to hurt so that she will remember that she belongs to him. He beats her with a belt. He gets his pleasure from causing her pain. He has to be in control. He has to own her. This is not a healthy loving relationship. It is abusive and it is illegal.  Sure he stalks her, belittles her, rapes her, abuses her, and hurts her, and she knows that maybe this isn't normal behavior, but she also knows that he really does love her. How does she know this? Because he buys her things, that's how. He buys her an expensive book (just to show you that I know more about you than you expect) an Apple computer that hasn't even been released yet (because I AM that powerful that I can get Apple to sell it to me first, right). He gives her a fancy cell phone (all the better to track every move you make my dear), he upgrades her seat to first class (I know you didn't tell me you were going away. After all, I said NO when you first mentioned that you would like to visit your mom, didn't I? But hey...it's First Class, right? See...I know everything you do)  He sells her car and buys her a new one (No, I didn't ask if you wanted a new car, or even what color you like, but remember, what you want or need doesn't matter. It's all about ME, remember? ) Heck...he even though she never told him where she would be working, or what her job would be, he still manages to buy the company she works for so that she can become an editor, fresh out of college.  (No, you didn't study journalism, you studied English literature, but what the heck. You work for me now)  Through many great stretches of the imagination, Anastasia and Christian end up married. They have a few kids and live happily ever after...at least till one of the kids defies him and he beats the child unconscious and breaks Ana's nose when she gets inthe way, trying to stop him...  No...that isn't the way the story ends, but it is the way real life ends with a man who has an emotional and mental disorder as severe as Christian Gray has.  BUT WAIT!  We all know that women who are treated with no respect, women who are stalked, beaten, belittled and abused always live happily ever after, right?  That is the message these books send to the hapless reader.  My fear is that somewhere along the way a sweet young lady will read this stuff and think that just because her boyfriend has knocked out a tooth or two doesn't mean that he is a bad guy, it just means that he really really loves her and just doesn't know how to handle his intense feelings of love for her. Maybe having a baby will make things all better. Maybe if I stop being so stupid and doing things to make him angry. Maybe if I love him enough he will change. Maybe....  It's a frightening thought, but it is the message this book presents.  The 50 Shades trilogy is a work of fiction.  It is not a well written work of fiction nor does it have a single literary redeeming feature. The story glorifies dominance, intimidation and abuse, and it does not, in any way give the reader an accurate depiction of the way a \\"healthy\\" BDSM relationship really works.  A realistic BDSM love story could be a truly sensuous story, if told properly...but this...not so much.  E L James obviously knows nothing about abusive relationships. Perhaps she should have Googled mental abuse, physical abuse, stalking, sexual abuse and most importantly, BDSM, just once, and taken a few notes. Maybe, if she had any idea how to tell the behavior patterns apart, she would have been able to write a book that was a lot more entertaining and a whole lot less disturbing.  I have to confess, I didn't buy these books for my reading pleasure. I own a bookstore and I wanted to know why every woman in town wanted to, no, they NEEDED to read all three of these books. I didn't read these books because I enjoyed the story. I didn't read these books because I found them sensuous, sexy or exciting. I read them because I was curious. My curiosity has not been satisfied, because now I am curious about why any woman with an ounce of self esteem could possible enjoy reading a story about a young lady who is so misguided and abused.  Perhaps my view of these books is tainted due partly to the fact that I lived through an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. I felt trapped and saw submission as the only way out....until I got lucky, and he left.  Wouldn't it be nice if the popularity of these books is an indication that twisted, abusive relationships like Christian and Anastasia's are rare, and that is why so many normal, healthy, intelligent women could read these books and not be bothered by the underlying message of abuse that these books give the reader. I would like to hope so.  Wouldn't it be nice if 50% of the proceeds from the upcoming film would go to women's shelters to help educate women on how to avoid becoming involved in, and how to safely and successfully end these dangerous, abusive relationships.
B00BIPCY14|5|Loveee this show!
B00F91RYL8|4|A highly entertaining movie that will have your heart stopping every few minutes. The action gets started immediately, and a couple times you actually think Pitt's character won't make it. It's fun to see the hero win because he's observant and has great analytical skills, and not because he's violent or aggressive.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is so fun very good characters and also a fun game to sit down and enjoy we think that this game was created excellent I give these people props for this subway surf aka so awesome and sweet.
B004JHYRDQ|5|Much like first book but excellent murder mystery.  Worth the read.
0783226551|5|it's a different movie. in a way you can see it as a drama, but definetly is an horror movie.<br />the movie belongs to De Niro, eventhough  Nolte, Lange and Lewis were great too.<br />but Max is a living devil in a human  form.  i don't recall characters like this, not supernatural but with  infinite power to hurt.<br />i read he lost the oscar to Anthony Hopkins for  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;.<br />well, that's something  else.<br />physicall/mind games vs. mind games/physicall.<br />really, does  anybody really matters?
B00L436E7A|4|Nice game.  Good graphics and fun challenges.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Excellent!
B00A9C3RB8|5|Exceptional acting by a incredible cast, and such a touching and heart warming story. Many I believe (especially 30 somethings plus, who have ever had a case of the doldrums in their marriage, or more significant relationship issues).
B009K52HN4|5|Love micheal Myers.  And of course the whole entire cast. Another one for jamie lee Curtis and janet Leigh. Cant forget llcool james.
B009UX2YAC|5|Awesome Addiction...can't get enough of this game. I have family and friends playing against one another (fun) Great game !!!!
B00KW1TGDE|1|purchased these lights less than 8 months ago.  Already 4 out of 5 bulbs have stopped working.  High price to pay for energy efficiency.  It would have been cheaper to use regular bulbs.  Not sure if it's the company or LED lighting is just not there yet.  To expensive of an investment to make on something that fails so easily.
B00594XOZU|5|A+++++++
B00AE9UYJ4|5|It is a great game. It scared me but it's fun . It is the best slender I have ever gotten. I Love this game !!!
B00004RFG0|5|One of the few movies that improve with age.  I loved it when it first came out and I'm buying it again to keep and never resell.  I'm surprised you don't hear more about this movie as it appeared right before the outbreak (like a rash or virus) of TV reality shows so it has a new relevance now.  But Truman is about more than just that--it is about what everybody's life is becoming.  And best of all it shows that Jim Carrey had the potential, sadly wasted, of becoming a fine actor under the control of a director the caliber of Peter Weir.  I can watch this movie or and over--and frequently do!
B003L16FAE|4|Tremendous. Arnold and his team of private commandos go on what they think is a rescue mission only to learn they are being hunted by a being from the stars. Turns out they need to rescue themselves!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Good Book
080011194X|2|Clearly, the world needs more cynics. Did, or does, Larry Flynt really care about the First Amendment? You bet, but only because it lets him make a livelihood selling pornographic magazines that also attack minorities and  gays. I can't wait for the Hollywood movie that portrays Charles Manson as  a kind-hearted performance artist who only wanted to use human blood and  entrails as a medium.
B00MIA0L9U|4|Another good quality sounding CD from the Foo Fighters. However, my problems with the cd is not the music but rather the length of it----only 8 songs. You just start getting into it and it's over. I really did not want to buy an EP with two bonus tracks----that's what it feels like anyway.
B00DR0PDNE|5|The chromecast really works and I have no problems with them.It works with my labtop, tablet, and smartphone.
B00C7EGV5U|4|A  very well told story of a time and a people whose life was severely affected by the introduction of religion.
0316204366|4|David and Goliath builds on Gladwell's previous works like Blink and Tipping Point. It follows the theme of unintended and unexpected consequences. It gives great real-world examples of how perceived and real weaknesses can be turned into strengths in unexpected ways. The opening analysis and explanation of the classic David and Goliath battle begins to get you thinking in new ways and by the end you'll be find yourself looking for way to implement your own full court press and battle your own giants.
B00BSBR9N6|4|The Rosie Project was a light-hearted, entertaining summer read. Don is a fascinating character who is lovable in spite of his quirks. You can't help but love Rosie.  A great storyline and easy read.
B00GAVJ77K|5|Helped with my kindle a lot better than another thing I had.
B002UBRFDC|5|I first read this book in 1980 (I believe) Today (2015) I decided to reread this book. What can I ay except &#34;Mercy&#34; I could see the vivid colors and the intense bushido of its Samurai. Blood, love, lust, cowardice and intense rivalries. Clavell brings these characters to life. A very good and entertaining read.
B000XUBFE2|4|EXCELLENT book, but this is not a book you want to read for true enjoyment.  It is a tough and sad book to read.  It hits the heart in more than one way.<br /><br />The story line that Markus Zusak is trying to achieve really makes its marks.  It opens your eyes and your heart goes out on every page you read!!<br /><br />Excellent book!!!!
B0056JJXOO|1|I am a classroom teacher and noticed some reviews mentioned a nude scene.  Wasn't this made in the sixties?  Are the reviews referring to the updated version? Does anybody have any idea where the scene is located?  I was planning on show it ASAP and haven't had a chance to watch the whole movie.
0767803434|4|That line itself is the most classic line of all from this smash hit! Harrison Ford plays the president who after making it clear to the world he will never negotiate with terrorists falls victim to a terrorists hijack of Air Force One! The president is pressed to the ultimate limit when his wife and daughter are held hostage by a Russian goon (Played so deliciously by Gary Oldman)! With the fates of the world &amp; his family both hanging in balance, it up to the president to kick some butt. Although the dialog &amp; action is 100% macho, some of the CGI effects for Air Force One leave much to be desired. When you see the end of the movie, you'll know what I mean! Still it has heart and attitude which makes it out to be a true action classic!
B0000TB03W|5|Wow!!  A great performance!  Gets your blood pumping!  Makes you want to dance and sing along with her!  I like the way she and her band get along on stage.  They're fun to watch!
B0097GVJWQ|5|I have played a few mystery games on my fire and so far this one is the best. Can not wait for part 2. Great job!!!
B00CKOYVG8|4|great games...I love to play the game when I have a work break
B0013ND36G|5|Great addition to the ongoing saga.  New twists with killer special effects make it a must watch and leave s you wanting even more!
B007J4T2G8|5|I love this book. There is nothing else like it. Adults testing the limits of their sexual relationship. Very smart book.
B00633W614|5|I could not get to the next chapter soon enough.  The characters are believable and each one's 'story' propels the reader to learn what comes next.  While I was rooting for Harry and Emma to reunite there was enough doubt laid that I was never sure.  The ending caught me off guard.  At first I thought it was too abrupt then then realized it could not have been more perfect.  I look forward to my next Archer read!  Jean
B00S24RT3C|5|Sufjan has thrilled us before with tales and fables of places where he has lived, this time the stories are far more personal. Heartfelt compositions detailing his relationship with his recently departed mother who battled mental illness throughout her life. It's beautiful stuff from one of the most talented songwriters of his generation. On early listens, there are many standout moments, but 'Should Have Known Better' stands shoulder to shoulder with his very best work. If you were moved by 'Casimir Pulaski Day' and 'To be Alone with You', you'll find much to love here.
B00003CWLF|5|Masterfully done another very good movie.
B0071XO8RA|5|I really enjoyed this. Makes you think. I could have kept on reading about Silo 17 and I will check out some of the authors other work.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Great action flick
B00B0LPWU6|3|Was an ok movie, but it was one I would rent and not buy. Would not care to see it again.
0061906220|4|The three year old boy I bought this book for loved it. It goes best with the video on the internet that includes the catchy music of the story. It's a great message for all of us!
B000002H2H|4|I just started my collection of Metallica and this is the first CD I got.  It is awsome!  &quot;For Whom The Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade To Black&quot; are my favorite songs.  I also realy like &quot;Ride The  Lightning&quot; and &quot;Creeping Death&quot;.  However, I am not the  biggest fan of &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; and I can't stand  &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot;.  &quot;Fade To Black&quot; has the best  guitar sounds I have ever heard.  &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot;is great  all around.  &quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; has little in the way of a  steady beat and &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; has bad lyrics and  generally a bad melody to put them in.  Those two are the only songs I  don't like.  I still recomend this CD to anyone who likes Metallica.  Its  one of the best.
B00B2V66VS|4|It's a lot of fun and works very well. Haven't experienced any glitches and I've had it for over a year.
0307277453|5|To understand biology, you must understand evolution. This book is absolutely the place to start when you're trying to educate people. It's incredibly accurate, informative and well-written and it explains why YOU exist. Evolution isn't some interesting thing that happened a long time ago, or that happens to insects and amphibians, evolution is YOUR history. Every single part of the human body came from a predecessor. Evolution has no end, we will (if we're lucky) be intermediate fossils someday. Everything is more magical when you understand it. When you actually open the black box and find out where you came from, you can never go back. Every answer generates so many more questions, it propels your mind to find out more. Aside from the necessity and fun of learning your own origins, this book is a fantastic compendium of all information regarding our direct ancestry. Normally, when explaining human evolution, I have to refer to books on genetics, books on the first tetrapods, books on the first fish, books on the first mammals, etc. I was thrilled when this book came out because finally I had all the necessities in one single source that I could direct people to. Neil Shubin has formally compiled all the information that I USED TO have to bring out from many different sources, making the whole education process easier. At times the book can be difficult, but only because certain concepts are, by their very nature, difficult. But I promise you he has explained these concepts in the clearest way possible, and the best method is to read the book cover to cover, then go back and reread the parts that were a little tough. If that doesn't take care of it, just use basic textbooks to refresh your knowledge of genetics or whatever it may be. I don't think that's necessary though, I think this book is readable by ANYONE, even if you don't use biological terminology in your daily life. As I said, I bought this book for pretty much everyone I know that didn't already have it. A lot of people I know already had it, and it is required reading for many classes at my university. My dad bought multiple copies (because people were asking him if they could borrow his) and he's not the only one of my acquaintances to end up buying more copies and passing it on. I'm actually on my second copy because my first one got really beat up thanks to being read too often and taken on too many road trips. Okay my review is too long so I'll stop. BUY THIS BOOK!.

B0064MPXFA|5|I just couldn't stop watching this series.  23 shows.  I ate them like a box of chocolates. No commercials! Yes!
B00FAX6XQC|5|Awesome game good graphics and excellent weapons looking forward to more challenges

B0012GMZMW|5|I had this one when it was first released and saw Journey with Steve Augeri. One year later, this CD disappeared along with a lot of my other stuff, if you get my drift. Not wanting to be reminded of this, I never bothered to replace it until now. What was my inspiration to replace it? Steve Augeri will be performing near my area in a few weeks, so I checked out those old sound clips. My reaction was that this was some damn good music and I should just forget about the past and replace it. The mail lady dropped it off on my front step a little while ago while I stayed home to avoid icy roads. This puppy rocks for the most part and is very upbeat. The only cut that I don't like is the mushy Loved By You, but the other 14 songs deserve my high rating.<br /><br />It is also good to note than I am in the 75% group of reviewers who rated this better than 3 stars. I was never one who liked Steve Perry, having been a fan of Journey before he even joined. So, I have no basis to compare him to Steve Perry. However, I have seen Journey with Steve Augeri and their current lead Arnel Pineda. I will take the stage presence of Steve Augeri any day over Arnel, who uses gimmicks like running through the floor of the arena and high-fiving as many of the fans as possible. Any idiot can do a cheap shot like that, but Steve Augeri has a truly awesome stage presence. Many compared him to Steve Perry, but I have no basis for comparing that. It is unfortuante that vocal chord problems caused Mr. Augeri's gradual departure. The follow-up full length CD to this one was called Generations and also has Mr. Augeri on it. The band experimented with all members being featured on lead vocals, which did not work. However, that &#34;experiment&#34; may have been to cover for Steve's vocal chord problems. Hopefully, Journey will bring Mr. Augeri back. Both Augeri and Pineda sound great in the studio, but Augeri's stage presence wins hands down. Journey is best enjoyed in a large arena!
B00VMQK37Q|5|Fantastic set! Love JT!
B007J4T2G8|5|I love this book and cannot wait to see where the next two books take Christian and Anastasia!  It's a must read and your husbands/boyfriends will appreciate it as well. ;)
B00FAX6XQC|4|I think this a really great game and enjoy it everywhere I bring my kindle. My dad likes it just as well as I do. But sometimes it is a bit laggy. Even though once I start playing it I have a great time.
B006PHD0RW|1|It sucks
1594135851|4|Well written - story plot moves with some twists & turns. Wasn't too impressed that they ended up back in the arena; almost as if the author thought \\"hey, it worked so well in book two, let's have another go at it here!\\"  But it contained a surprise that was worth the read. Overall, great series.
B00L9B7IKE|5|I couldn't put it down. If you liked Gone Girl you will love it. It is a great read. ☺️
B00QW8TYWO|5|Fun game.  Kills time
B0089LOG02|5|I couldn't put it down.  Makes you want more!  The connection between the main characters, although more than 70 years apart in age, is so deep.
B004XJRQUQ|5|It is the best book ever it is so awesome that I read it 9 times and no skipping pages
B0076794IO|4|What started out as a seemingly predictable story just kept getting more complex with all the layers of secrets. It kept me thinking and made this an enjoyable read.
0060930349|5|I've now read this and Schweikart's Patriot's History of the US.  It was inevitable as I read that I would compare the two. They are in many ways very similar.  I enjoyed Schweikart and felt it was very easy to read.  At the beginning I struggled with Johnson.  I was reading 50 - 100 pages at a clip in Schweikart where at the beginning of Johnson I was struggling to get through 20 at a time.  I'm not sure why that was... but as I got further into the book it got easier.  It's 976 pages, so it's a fairly long book, but having finished it I am glad I read it.  It is different than Patriot's History, but I don't see that as a good thing or a bad thing.  As a side note, I found it interesting that Paul Johnson (author) is British.  I found it interesting to see an Englishman's thoughts on our progress and that he seemed positive about a great deal of the things we have done, even things that were counter to England's interests.  On the whole a good book, well worth my efforts in reading.  Hope you enjoy as well.
B003F3FJQO|3|I really liked the Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials were good... but where is the author going with this?  After two books, I'm still confused as to why these kids are being put through these Varibles.  Yes, I understand their world is crumbling around them and they may be its only saviors... but why a maze?  Why do they need to run through a city to get to a safe haven by a certain time?  Hopefully the third book will explain everything.
B002QE3CTY|5|This book is grate it has every thing from adventure to determination to team work I would recommend this book to a mature teen who can deal with reading about death
B000058T5E|4|Once again Mr.Beck has left me totally blown away by his guitar work! He simply knows no bounds and shows his range of abilities.If one compares the thrashy &quot;Earthquake&quot;,the bluesy &quot;Rollin' And Tumblin'&quot; and the delicate &quot;Nadia&quot; you could conclude that this man can execute any guitar style he chooses, as well as inventing new ones. What 'da Vinci' is to art, this man is to the guitar... This album kicks! If you like the guitar's of :Zappa, Vai, Moore, Satch...Check this out!
B00HV8TN7K|3|If you are a sailor it's hard to watch without criticism. Redford does a good job of portraying an old man. The setting and environmental elements are good. The Technical is terrible, obviously written by someone with almost no sailing experience.
B000PHX4VA|5|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. I LOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEE THE POLICE .
B00H48ES7C|5|Have always loved this game and have it on my desktop,laptop and now android. And will add it to the kindle I hope<br />to get soon!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Best series available...if Julian (writer) would just let us keep some of the characters a little longer before killing them off!
B00FAPF5U0|5|this game is so cool I don't know what to say.  o well I will just say that this game is amazing and so cool it blows you away.
B002MQYOFW|4|Gets kinda boreing but it gets better.when I read this I felt picturing the people from the movies.I will be reading catching fire.
B009ZQC7MY|5|EXCELLENT SERIES!!!!
B0039YZPZ4|5|Hard for me not to love a movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it. As always, he delivers. This is a fun romp.
B0097EWK3A|5|Solve the mystery by going to different location within the town<br />and gathering the items needed to move to the next clue.
B00BMVTS1S|5|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was very well done, great visuals, scripting was well thought out and moved along, and the script was full of adventure and true to the original book. The visuals were seamless from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. All and all it was excellent. Looking forward to the next three installments of Peter Jackson.
B000ATQYT2|5|great product, great price, fast delivery.
B0091XRL0E|3|When I saw the trailer for this I thought it would be fun, Claymation which I have liked since it first came out... I guess I was hoping for something a little bit better...
B00AFROVQC|4|It's very good story, though I do think more could have happened in this book .I will be getting the second book,I'll really like to know more about Thor and Erec,Whats with the Queen anyway?
B00BWBHIUG|5|Great graphics and love that I don't have to worry about opening up an app full of floating fish... be prepared to spend hours harvesting algae and sand dollars!
B009ZQC7MY|5|I now know what all the talk of this series is about!!  Love every moment of the stories!  Highly recommend.
B00B0D29E6|4|This album is most likely a must own for any deep purple fan since it has their biggest hit \\"smoke on the water\\".
B00459GJUM|4|Cancelled too early.<br /><br />This show does have some flaws and slow points, but the characters are good and were really getting interesting when the show was cancelled.<br /><br />Hopefully someday it gets renewed.
B00DVPN30A|5|I don't know if Amos Lee can top this album but I am looking forward to seeing if he can because I want more, more, more from him.  Loved this album and it's right up there neck and neck with Mission Bell.  Soulful lyrics (which I do wish were included) and great musicians backing him up.  Wonderful!  It's my new go-to CD in my car.
B00OMKEK64|5|Every bit as good as the Three Tenors, the Texas Tenors, Michael Crawford, Forte, and/or Michael Buble. If you enjoy soundtrack music/songs sung by talented young men, this is the CD for you.  I like to listen to it to relax.  No wonder Collator won Britain's Got Talent last year.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazing book. Couldn't put it down. Made me cry at the end. I would read this again! Love this book...
B005GFPZYK|2|I enjoyed the story of Chris Kyle's life.  His acts of valor in the war were inspiring.  I gained a further appreciation for those who serve our country.  For various reasons, I was frequently reminded that the author is a Navy SEAL, not an literature major.  Because of his writing style, I can not give this book a high rating.
B0044ZQ8QC|5|Nice collection of the works of a classic Italian baroque composer.  If you don't own any recordings of Corelli's music...get some.
0140177396|5|This is one of my all-time favorite books! John Steinbeck had created a wonderful and haunting story about various Western farmers. Loneliness is the major theme in this novel. Steinbeck captures the true essence of what it's like to be sad and unfulfilled. And the friendship between George and Lennie is both funny and poignant. It was especially touching when George decides that he can no longer protect Lennie from the horrible things that he hadn't intended to do. Who can resist a novel with such strong message and symbolism? This is one of the best pieces of literature ever -- a true American classic!
630463949X|5|Be wary listening to the criticisms of the sound quality on this DVD. The Dance is the best-sounding concert recording I've heard. The sound is artificially surround distributed, which may be what the critics are  whining about, but personally I think it's better because the band sounds  much closer than other DVD's and you can hear each instrument including the  maracas and tamborines crisply and clearly.<br />Notice that the criticisms  ALWAYS compare to only 2 DVD's: Eagles and James Taylor. These are  apparenty the Holy Grails but if you don't have DTS, you're not one of the  few Taylor fans out there, or you want more than 2 DVD's on your shelf, try  the Dance. Unless you're an &quot;audiophile&quot; who MUST use vacuum-tube  monoblocks for each channel and triple shielded super-conducting speaker  cable or else your ears feel pain, I think you'll like it.
B0091REZMW|3|Trying to figure out .Two days and still do not know how it works. Anyone can you  help me  on it
B004SJ3BCI|5|I do not know why people would give this game one star. I have it in my kindle fire for free.  everybody in my family is addicted to it, and it is great for ten year olds like me!  please! play! this!  game!!!!!
B00L9B7IKE|2|This is a dismal story of sad alcoholism which was contributed to by a narsistic husband, making our 'author' turn inward. Finding vicarious family by looking out the train window, while actually pretending to go to &#34;work&#34; was depressing.<br />Although the ending revealed justification for this decline, the whole thing was dismal and lacked the spark that a heroine should convey.<br /><br />Would not recommend it unless you want to feel better about yourself since you are not her.
B005PK57IK|5|Current binge watching nominee. Once we get thru Season 5, we'll head over to latest release of House of Cards.
B008XG1X18|4|i love this app... especially compared to the previous pinterest app i had on my kindle fire. it is sooo user friendly and easy to move around in. the only problem is that every now and then it takes a long time to load when i first start it up. a few times it wouldn't even load at all and I had to force close. other than those small issues I am very pleased with this app.
B004SJ3AXI|5|I think it's awesome that Rovio Entertainment created the original Angry Birds.  But now that the Seasons are here,  well it's even better!! I highly recommend this new style to Angry Birds lovers. If you don't like Angry Birds I wouldn't play it, unless you like making fun of games you don't like.
B0064X7FVE|3|This app is amazing, I mean before they created a new version which I hate .why I hate it: 1. No refresh button 2. It's definitely hard to work with.But there is something I really enjoyed I can look at the 10 day forecast for the next day and it gives me the hour with the temp. Where you couldn't do that in the old version . So that's why I  gave it 3 stars.
B00E8KLWB4|4|hard  but  fun
B004SJ3BCI|5|My wife and I really love to play it, keeps us busy for hours. Great graphics and fun to play Highly recommended for all!
B005XQLBU4|3|What can i say...its the classic missile defense game.
B00K25GL7Y|1|Tried downloading this app via Goole play as well an cannot even get it to load. Wiped Sony Tablet S to install as only app on device with no success. At least it is afree app and all I've lost is time. Guess Wizards of the Coast will only be getting money from me via my local card shop.
140120841X|5|V for Vendetta is a classic in his medium (graphic novels). It's subversive and entertaining at the same time. If you love reading and visual arts and literature that makes you think, this book is a must-have classic. The paper is soft and the size is quite good. I'm nearsighted and I didn't find any difficult to read (I tried reading on my iPad and I couldn't because the letters were too small). It's a good edition.
B00KW282MO|5|One of the best suspense action movies we've seen in awhile.  The suspect won't be anyone you think it is!
B00IU0M85C|5|A bit dark at times, but very good and entertaining. A new approach to the subject of clones. An outstanding performance by the main character.
B008JFUO4U|5|Good flick
B005779X4U|4|This is a very nice and resistant trash can. The can for regular trash is a little small, and we have to empty it every 1 or 2 days (for a family of 4), but this is not not a big deal. We empty the recycle can every day but I think that depends on how serious you are about recycling. It blocks and isolates odors as it advertises and the silent close lid works perfect! Another very nice feature is the little red switch on the right side that prevents the lid to close without stepping the pedal while you're taking out the trash. Fingerprint proofing is not as good as they advertise, but overall I give it a 4 star.
B000R3NNDQ|5|Kotter has an amazing knack for simplifying concepts so that we can put them to work in our lives right away. His eight steps are not just for penguins! We can use them in every endeavor which involves change. In fact, in every change someone has gone ahead with these steps to make it happen. Why not you?
0375869026|5|Excellent
B00FATEJYE|5|Great game but I wish some of the characters where cheaper but I love this gameplay I have recommended to everyone I know because is that good why can I get some reward for getting more people to play it but besides that am ok with what I have
1476770387|4|Stephen King has repeatedly lamented the fact that so many people tell him their favorite book of his, more often than not, is something from the 1970s or ’80s, like The Stand or The Shining or Misery. He’ll say something like, “It’s a little disappointing to discover so many people find your best work to be many decades past.” But I happen to feel he’s done some of his absolute finest writing in the last ten years or so! He’s my favorite author, and influenced me to become a novelist rather than a sports writer (starting at the tender age of 12—after I first read The Shining). I adore books from throughout his entire 40-plus-year publishing career.<br /><br />In any case . . . perhaps because of the near-fatal collision between his body and a speeding van in 1999, or maybe because he felt a kind of liberation after finally completing his enormously complex and nuanced masterwork—the seven-book Dark Tower series—I truly feel he’s produced some of his most beautiful and literarily relevant works in the latter stages of his writing life. Stuff like Lisey’s Story, 11/22/63, Under the Dome (my personal all-time favorite), and Full Dark, No Stars. And his newest offering, Revival (released just a couple weeks ago on November 11), is an entirely respectable overall addition to the fantastic groove he’s managed—some might say miraculously—to carve into his path the last decade.<br /><br />Revival focuses on the intersecting lives of its two main characters. Jamie Morton spends most of his life as a kind of bohemian rock guitarist and a heroin addict. Reverend Charles Jacobs, Jamie’s childhood pastor, experiences an appallingly traumatic event; he then delivers a “Terrible Sermon” denouncing god and religion. Jacobs goes on to devote his life to studying and experimenting with electricity, striving for his ultimate goal of harnessing the “secret electricity,” which would create unspeakable power and danger. The plot is engaging and kept me on my toes. I found the romantic subplot beautiful, sweet, and surprising. King very accurately portrayed a multitude of things: the horrors of addiction, music’s power to bring people together, the clear evidence against a loving god, and how religion-based charlatans can use faith as a weapon to take advantage of the sick and/or vulnerable and/or gullible. My only real problem with Revival was I thought its climactic scene fell flat. That it suffered from a lack of the imaginative voltage King pumped into the rest of the novel. Even so, it was a worthwhile read. It’s far superior to Mr. Mercedes, his previous clunker of a novel, and the electric energy of Revival makes me even more disappointed that he’s turning the former into a trilogy.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Love all the music!
B005LAIGFU|1|This is a film in the \\"monster baby\\" genre. These films typically provide a means by which people can express politically incorrect attitudes toward children and parenthood in a situation contrived to allow it. The film stacks the deck about as far as it can by making the child (Kevin) an irredeemable monster on a path toward monsterhood from birth. The greater his monsterhood, the greater the contrived excessess of his mother the film can wallow in.  The fatal problem of the film is that it mixes a whole kitchen sink of general psychological baggage about parenting up with the problems of having been the parent of a child who has committed a horrible act. Doing either one of these subjects in isolation would have been good. Doing them both together is not so good. And not so good in particular because the one (his being a monster) allows the other (the psychological aspect) to go off without any bounds at all. Of course ultimately horror makes money and serious films dont.  The film is also full of rather heavy handed symbolism. Subtile it is not. Red. Red. Red. Red....  The film is about as nihilist as them come. Guilt and shame in fatal doses covers everything. No shades of grey anywhere. There is also more than a bit of rather mindless man-hatred lurking in the background. Its difficult to know how to look at some of this. Are her memories a real view of what happened or are they the product of revisionism based on guilt?  In the end, its all so emotionally overheated and manipulative that its difficult to take anything serious away from it. It seems mostly an excuse to drown the viewer in negative emotions for a couple hours.
B00005JLYW|5|To all those people who gave this film a thumbs down i have one word to describe you............BORES! This isn't a film concerned over plot but what it is concerned with is entertaining the viewer which I think is the point of movies today dont you?<BR>Drew,Lucy and Cameron seem like they are having so much fun making this film and this adds to the flick itself. The Special effects are A+ grade and the camera moves swiftly and smoothly through the films many amazing setpieces especially the breathtaking final rooftop scene where the angels battle it out with the sizzling Demi Moore.<BR>Finally I urge all you Ker-azzy internet buyers out there to purchase this film and see for yourself if you like /love/hate this film.
B00DGNO3WE|5|Loved it.......super cast...sweet story....well acted.....highly recommend it!  Bonus of good music and sweet relationships....well worth your time...Enjoy it as I did...
6300214354|5|This first film of Val Kilmer is definitely his funniest.  He did a great acting job and kept the movie going.  This is a movie that I had to watch more then once to get all the jokes. I reccomend this to anyone who likes spoofs or just plain comedies.
B008KS4DR0|5|Awesome
B007PS0DTI|5|This movie was as great as the others were. A lot of surprises along the way. Looking forward to the next one in the series. If there is to be one, that is. I'm hoping.
B0089EHWQE|5|I would recommend this book to everyone. I absolutely loved it and I would consider it one of my top 5 all time favorite books. It is written in a way that is absolutely captivating and full of compassion. I also read The Last Letter From Your Lover. That was a great book as well!
B00COGY2P2|4|I know, I know its bad casting.  Tom Cruise should not be Jack Reacher.  The books are much, much better.  Plus much more.  But I gave 4 stars.  Because despite what we know from the books, the movie can stand on its on and with out all the posturing and tech stuff we normally see in Tom Cruise action film.  It is worth a look.  especially for prime members.
B00HV8TN7K|2|Depressing and slow
B00E5N8E6K|5|I live in Vegas and was lucky enough to see Def Leppard do this show.  We were up in the rafters and the sound was not that great at the Hard Rock.  However on the video the sound is awsome and the band sounds better than they did 25 years ago.  The show was very slick and polished and brought back memories of teenage years listening to Hysteria.  Also the preshow / opening act also Def Leppard was great.  This concert was a blast to go to but I prefer the video the sound is better and seeing it in on my tv is way better than seeing it from the rafters.
0451419243|4|I had read the first in the trilogy and high expectation for book 2. It caught me up just as quickly and carried me along. If you liked/loved the first, you will equally enjoy the second.
B00BAXFECK|5|This is such a well written story.  In an extraordinary manner, It covers of lot of territory of a young man growing up. I needed to resort to my dictionary a number of times, which to me is a plus. It is unusually descriptive of a piece of art.
B00866JLEG|5|I usually do not like love stories as they often seem to lack any substance.  For some reason this really touched me.  The characters are flawed but redeemable and ultimately do the right thing.  Who knew Zac Efron would turn out to be such a good actor.  I hope we get to see more of him.
B000063DHK|5|Best sound, best stage, excellent band, excellent special effects, superb production. This is the best live album you will ever hear, period.
B004LV32JU|4|This is something you listen to and start to think joining a big circle pit in a live gig of Sylosis. The guitar riffs are the spot here and the mixing of time during drumming/bass make the music more complex but still catchy and with great heavy punch.
B007IE4DSG|5|sounds like you are in the room with Mr. Harrison as he is speaking and singing to GOD. A must for any acoustic guitar player and for anyone who wants to hear some basic spiritual songs.
B00J3AW23G|4|I am sure having a lot of fun with it. Kind of soothing to play. Not difficult at least at the lower levels. I recommend Pipe puzzle for anyone.
B00LDNE3FG|5|I love this game my friend showed it to me and now I am addicted!!!!!!!<br />Great for kids and adults !!!!  LOL
0804139024|5|Curse you Andy Weir. Seriously. Your fault: I hardly slept last night. I could not—could not!—put your book down. It was too good.<br /><br />I loved Chris Hadfield’s ASTRONAUT’S GUIDE TO LIFE ON EARTH, and when a commander of the International Space Station praises a book for “fascinating technical accuracy”, it makes my internal ears perk up. My interest is piqued. Then, the author of WOOL (who sold like a billion copies of his independently published work before getting professionally bound) said, “The best book I've read in ages. Clear your schedule before you crack the seal.” I should have listened. Nope. And there went my night.<br /><br />Here’s the mix: science and galley humor. With one of the best opening lines ever (censors prevent me from posting it; look it up on Amazon’s preview) and with the stranded astronaut/science guy trying to survive in his “Little Hab on the Prairie”—I’m slayed. Mark Waney, the protagonist, says, “I suppose I’ll think of something. Or die.” And so while he’s recording his journal entries, the earth is watching in fascination and desperate hope.<br /><br />Incredible would not be the right word for this. If Tom Hank’s Castaway Island was located on Mars and MacGyver was sent as the strandee, then this is what you get. Take a bunch of science—engineering, botany, chemistry (explosive at times)—and tie it together with math, and holy cow! Trust me, even if you aren’t scientific by nature, this is written in an exciting manner that zips by. Did I mention hard to put down?<br /><br />Despite the sagacious humor, science, and adventure, I like the encompassing lesson: “every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out.”<br /><br />Thanks to Crown and Random House for sending me this book to review—it was awesome! And I don’t say that lightly. I received this book for free from Blogging for Books for this review.
0061537969|5|Great Story.  Very entertaining and you don't have to like racing to love this book.  A MUST READ!
B002IFT1ZA|5|In short this series is one of the best things I have seen on TV ever. Right from the word go, I was transported to Westeros and lead through a complex web of stories.  The production values were incredible, the sets and landscapes and costumes were beyond incredible. Some of the cutaways were just amazing, seeing into the kitchen between two important scenes just made everything seem so real. MAGICAL!  The performances were all amazing too, I believed every character and felt every interaction and motivation.  The scripts were incredible and each episode well paced and packed full of amazing content.  There was no other way to tell this epic story, HBO have done an amazing job, and as a fan of the book I feel even better knowing the author (Martin) was heavilly involved and consulted quite closely with the entire team involved.  Buy it and support this AMAZING show.
0439023521|5|Ok, so I freely admit that  didn't even know this book existed until the Hunger Games Movie was released and I went to see it. This book has a lot of themes in the perfect blend and was a lot more explanatory than the movie was. If you enjoy the movie, get the book,  It will clarify small things that are seen in the movie but may not be entirelly understood until you read the book.
B000JMKTLO|4|It kept me interested. The length of the book was just right. Good twists in the end that I didn't see coming
B00006I53S|5|i purchased one of these a couple of years ago and was very pleased with it.  my son bought his wife a newer model rebel, so i bought this lens for her for christmas.  she loves it as well, says it takes much better pictures than the stock lens that came with her camera and she loves the zoom.
B0011B5QZQ|5|An incredibly well written episode that inspired powerful emotions for characters we have become emotionally invested in.  Well done Chris!
0545615402|4|this was a gift for my granddaughter, who is a big Harry potter fan...It was the highlight of her Christmas...
B000FCK42M|5|A great, amazing book about the War on Drugs from the perspective of a huge cast on both sides of the war.  Art Keller, a lone DEA agent, wants to stop the drug trafficking on U.S. borders, but everyone, including his allies want to stop him.  Lots of action and mayhem erupt in his struggle and he has a difficult time trusting anyone. Now Don Winslow has followed up the intrigue and blood sport with The Cartel, mirroring the continuing war we all unknowingly face each and every day!

B00881VLCE|5|this app is great it keeps my kids entertained for at least an hour or more I love it!!!!!! i have a kindle fire and the app works great on it.
B00HGJ18C2|4|wish those ads didn't come between each game
0930289234|5|This is a good book.  Most people say that.  What works best at the heart of this book is how labor intensive it is.  It would be nice to see this kind of treatment turned onto say the XMen.
B00JORDEJ4|5|I love this show! The storyline and acting is superb! My favorite characters are all of them, especially Mr. and Mrs. Bates! They are so cute together. I'm going to hate to see it end after the 6th season.
B009ZQJ0ME|3|High tech CG and Matrix-like messages.  You have to just kick back and appreciate the action and fight scenes even if they are far fetched.
B0008G2P22|5|Fast shipping<br />Excellent product!<br />Thanks!!!!
B0019IB0II|5|Excellent book. The first thing that you want to know when this happens to a loved one, is what they are thinking and feeling. This book helps you to see more and to understand.
B00000DFRS|2|I have been a fan of Whitney Houston ever since her debut album back in the early 1980's.  The first time I heard her sing, I knew that God had truly blessed her with the most powerful and magical voice.  I have  purchased every soundtrack that has come out with her  and was amazed and  moved to tears at times at the sheer power and emotion she fueled into  every song.  Obviously I was very eager to hear her 1st non-soundtrack  album in 8 years.  Arista records proclaimed it was, &quot;Whitney like  you've never heard her before&quot;!   They were RIGHT about that. I could  not believe my ears upon hearing the 1st track, then each subsequent one to  follow.  There was none of the Whitney magic on this CD.  I could not feel  any emotion for these songs, with the only exceptions being &quot;Until You  Come Back&quot;, which is a beautiful ballad where Whitney does manage to  squeak out the one high note and the very end of the song,  and &quot;When  You Believe&quot;.  For the people who will say that Whitney has gone into  uncharted territory and is expanding musically, I say fine. My problem is  that the years of smoking, drinking and emotional turmoil have ravaged Ms.  Houston's voice.  The magic is no longer there.  I enjoyed, &quot;I Was  Made To Love Him&quot;, but any singer could have done this track.  The  most ridiculous song was &quot;In My Business&quot;, written by Missy  &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliot who proclaims the word &quot;hore&quot; in  the songs a couple of times.  I am truly disappointed in &quot;My Love Is  Your Love&quot;, and felt that Whitney could have given her fans a much  better production.  There was none of Ms. Houston's signature style and  vocal acrobats that her fans have become accustomed to.  I never want to  hear Whitney like this again Arista!!!!!
B0001ENY6M|5|I was excited hearing ancient Azerbaijani instrument duduk in the Passion of Christ. <br />    I hope people in the US will hear more Azeri music in the future and not only duduk performance.<br />    Indeed, Azerbaijan(ancient Albania) is arguably the first christian country in the world. I don't know if John Debney knew this, but it is certainly a very interesting coincidence.<br />    I recommend everyone to listen.
B0092MKFIY|5|Fabulous download with great quality and clarity! Also was at a great price, get this album before people start discovering this band and they jack the price up!
B002RVZV9K|5|I absolutely love Led Zeppelin best band to walk the earth IMO. So needless to say it was a complete thrill to see Jimmy on the big screen. Like someone else had mentioned when we went to the theatre to see it, when it was over no one wanted to get up it was so riveting. It is a fantastic documentary but having Jimmy in it made it all that much better. He is so elegant & humble even though he is a guitar genius!

B001Q8PC8A|4|A mate bought this movie around last night. I watched it without knowing anything about it.<br />I liked it a lot. Scirpt was tight, Very nice Editing-Smooth moves whilst all the clues were presented without knowing on first watch.<br />Al Pacino Particularly shines. 30 years of repiticious police work for the NYPD shows through.<br />It's worth a second look which for me means its Good, DeNiro was Deniro but his character does change, in a clever way.
B004GJDQT8|1|There's just no need for such broad permissions.

B000003TAB|5|This album never got as much recognition as Nevermind or In Utero, but it can compete with both albums. There are a lot of great songs and it is an important contribution from Nirvana's short but revolutionary career.
0061906220|5|We saw this book at our local library.  The cover enticed my 4 year old, so we brought it home.  The story is simple and cute, the illustrations are great. We can't wait for another Pete The Cat story! Both the 4 year old and 6 year old loved it.
B007MDB71O|4|This movie is a good mix of future, past, and great effects. I thought the plot was good and the story line was fun.  The characters were good and interesting.  It left you wanting more when it's over.
B00B7Y0206|2|Is no like is Better in other devices no
B00I8H7APK|5|Great romantic comedy/ drama. Includes time travel, romance, coming-of-age, and relationships. Wonderful cinematography and location scenery. Nice story and character development.
B00EMXBDMA|2|The concept is interesting, but the writer is kind of sophomoric in his comedy, it was distracting to me throughout the book.

0385535147|5|Bought this as a gift for a Grisham fan, who hasn't put it down since it got here. Says he loves the book.
B008JFUPK8|5|Thought the movie was a great start to hopefully a strong franchise. I'm one of those people who didn't really appreciate Batman Begins until I loved The Dark Knight. I think most people will feel the same about this movie, on its own it won't break records but I believe that it sets a great tone for the Man of Steel in future films and I look forward to seeing what they do with the character! I would recommend it.
B00LXLM05I|5|so much fun
B000028U0Y|5|Johny was a dark soul who was beautiful. He can find a way to make anyine smile and forget about where they are in life and how bad it might be. He reaches out to you with a smile and a silly joke or too & even in prison, you realize that life is not so bad.
B00013F38K|4|The quality of the set is good compared to my vhs tapes copied from tv, but I wish they had removed the scratches and other imperfections that are evident. I would have preferred dual-layer dvd's rather than flippers, also.<br />I often wondered why the producers didn't use Bruce Lee for the main role. If, however, Caine is supposed to be half Chinese, it is clear why Bruce Lee wasn't used for the part. It is often difficult to discern a half asian individual from any dark-haired, dark-eyed caucasian (I know, I live with some)(They should have darkened Carradine's hair and eyes -- or at least his eyes when he was bald). It's pretty humorous when all the old west cowboys immediately notice that Caine \\"has some yellow blood\\". <br />After listening to the creators talk about why Lee wasn't used (\\"I just couldn't understand the guy\\"), I have to agree. Just listen to his line \\"I wee wo mon\\" (I will old man) in Enter the Dragon and imagine listening to this week after week. Don't get me wrong, I love Bruce Lee's movies, but I love them for the action, not the clearly delivered dialogue and philosophy. His son, Brandon, would have been perfect for the role, however.<br />Anyway, If you liked the original series and are not a rabid videophile, you will probably like the dvd set also. It would have been better if they provided the original full screen AND the wide screen version. Maybe they'll come out with the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" in a year or so. Even my kids like the old series, and why not? They were raised on the Care Bears; not that much different than Kung Fu, in philosophy anyway!
B003FC1752|1|After watching the original Poseidon Adventure I rolled this into my queue mainly out of curiosity of how Hollywood would goose the effects and story telling.<br /><br />Poseidon goes belly up in all ways - characters (vapid - you could care less about anyone), story (tension less), and EFX are phoned in. How can you blow the lead in of the oncoming wave? Ask Wolfgang Petersen who's obviously in it for a massive payday.
6302891272|4|This was a very interesting way of representing Shakespeare's Macbeth.<BR>Before I saw it I was skeptical that Shakespeare in any other language than English would be lacking. <BR>I think that Kurosawa makes up for the lack of rich Shakespearean language with all kinds of interesting cinematic touches, such as the eerie white makeup he uses for the witch(es) and ghost(s). I also liked the camera angles used, even though many of the cuts were held too long. <BR>Even though the overall plot was similar to Shakespeare's Macbeth there were one or two things that I feel made it a completely different story. Macbeth's motivation to kill the king was very different in Kurosawa's version. I think the fact that Washizu (Macbeth) tells his army about the witch(es) radically changes the overall ending.
B002PEP4SC|4|Pretty fair read. Not as good as a Robert B Parker novel but still entertaining. I recommend it.
B0001HAISG|4|Ultimately, PJ Hogan's Peter Pan is a success. <br /> <br />There is one patch about half an hour in, shortly after the arrival in Neverland, when the film is not quite happy with itself: It becomes far too cute and saccharine for its own good; the makers can't seem to make up their mind whether they're pitching for a jolly fun, old-fashioned entertainment or a run-of-the-mill kiddies' blockbuster; but thankfully, things improve, and the film moves at a suitable pace towards a thrilling climax. <br /> <br />Jason Isaacs is in excellent form as both Mr Darling and the dastardly Captain Hook, and I also enjoyed British comedy stalwart Richard Briers as Smee. As Peter, Jeremy Sumpter has the facial features to be cheekily good-looking without becoming too cutesy, and his performance strikes a nice balance between charm and stubbornness. <br /> <br />The special effects belong to the eighties -- I got the impression they threw away the budget on the crocodile and only later remembered they had other setpieces to fund -- but the whole thing is generally good fun, with enjoyable characterizations and a delightfully old-fashioned feel, even if it sometimes comes across as a little twee. <br /> <br />The poignancy with which the themes of childhood and growing up are dealt with gives it the edge over other versions I have seen, including Disney's memorable 1953 animation.
B0054JZC6E|3|good app, but kinda difficult games. Wish you knew what the games were about before you buy them. :) Good for passing time!
B00EL8I8IS|2|Bad movie, plot is very thin. This is all zombies dumb!

B000002B35|5|WOW!!! This Album sounds AMAZING!!! I'm not a big fan of live album's but PULSE just blew me away. The cover is one of my favorite's, you could spend an hour just looking at the cover art. I was also stunned hearing Dark Side Of The Moon in it's entirety. Pink does such a great job, David Gilmore and Tim Renwick have such an awsome chemistry, the two different styles of lead guitar playing sound's fabulous, Tim's slightly more technical and Dave's got a way of making three note's sound like there from heaven, nobody does it better, a tie, maby Jeff Beck? David Gilmore's voice is wonderful and Richard Wright sounds great to, the backup girl's are perfect like always, bass playing, technical and tastfull element's tight as ever with a healthy nick mason behind the kit. I also want to give plenty of cretit to the gentleman playing percussion and sax, just an all out incredible effert on PINK FLOYD'S part. I think I listen to PULSE more than any of the studio album's, it's that GOOD, no it's that GREAT!!
B00EOARZ4G|4|Good story line.  The method of linking past and present is a little confusing at times but overall works well.
B00B4VI8MQ|5|This is the best game I have played for a while. T he hidden object part is wonderful. please G5 more like this!

B00CNQ7HAU|3|I have read almost all of John Grishams novels and normally find them absorbing reads,where you don't know whats coming next.<br /><br />Sycamore row is not one of his best. I still read it but found it to be a bit slow and predictable. I knew the ending about a third of the way into the book. I flicked over a few filler pages especially during the trial where there was a degree of repetition about what had previously been written. I still read it but was glad i was reading a library version. I would have been disappointed if I had paid good money for it.
B00JV5POOM|5|If it is possible to wear out a digital album, I would have worn out this one. After months of play, it continues to improve with each listen. All of the accolades, best of lists, over the moon reviews, etc still do not do this album justice.
0385532458|3|I am not a hardcore Grisham fan, but I have enjoyed several of his books in the past. This collection of short stories has a common thread that ties them all together - they all occur in Ford County, a small rural community in Tennessee. Each story takes a \\"Grisham\\" turn (for the worse for the characters). Average reading.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Awesome awesome awesome!!!  I was blown away by the great writing. I could hardly put it down. Thanks for a great read!
B00000JMP9|2|The singing of the two principles (especially Fassbaender) is good and the film looks pretty. But the director compresses the performance to feature film length by deleting every scene that does not involve the two principal singers. This is not a performance of \\"Werther\\"; it is a disk of highlights.

B00L9B7IKE|5|A little bit of the Gone Girl feel - but a great piece of mystery, with a healthy side-dose of the dangers  of solving problems  in gin and tonic.  The dialogue and descriptions were both imaginative and believable ( none of the &#34;no one talks like that&#34; feeling  or how many ways can you say &#34;cloudy&#34;).
B00127RAJY|5|Love it!  This workout kicks butt and definitely gets results, and all within 20 minutes.  You will work hard, but can't beat it!
B00006690H|4|this is a good cd, i'll admit. but if you really want it, buy the explicit version. i bought the clean verson (thats all my parents will let me listen to) and it sounds horrable. even though all the songs are good, theres like 20 bleeps a song. its enough to drive you crazy. the \\"without me\\" song is the only one that sounds good. .... don't buy the clean one unless your easily offended, or thats all your parents will let you have.
B005GY0Y8S|5|I have to admit that when I started this book I was a little unsure about whether or not I would like it.  The story just started without much character description as if I should know who these people were. After the first few chapters I thought &#34;Oh what the heck, I'll keep reading anyway.&#34;  and then POW! my attention was caught and it stayed there until the very last page.  a must read for mystery readers.
B00QRCYLYG|5|This is a fun monster fighting game
B0038M2AZA|5|This is a WONDERFUL true story of a very special lady.  We've bought more than just one of these DVDs and given them to friends who, like us, didn't know very much about autism.  Claire Danes does a superb job portraying Dr. Grandin.... Just an excellent work.  (Thank you for fast service as well....)
B0015DROBO|2|I really hate to leave such a low-starred rating for a book, but oh, dear. I bought the Kindle version and when I saw that family tree at the beginning, my heart sank. When books need organization charts for the characters, it usually means there will be too many to keep track of, hence the chart. But (and this is a technical issue) it was so tiny on my Kindle I couldn't read it no matter how fiddled with the display. In any event, I soldiered on. I was somewhat intrigued at the beginning, and I did find Lisbeth interesting.<br /><br />Sure enough, I lost track of all the characters mentioned, some who didn't matter to the plot and never appeared onstage. But all those pages and pages of pointless activity. It was like watching a surveillance video of people with very dull lives, interrupted by moments of violence, sex, and animal abuse. By the time I'd made my way to the revelation of the villain--whose personal history seemed kind of over the top to me--I didn't care. If one compares said villain with Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, this guy is pretty mundane.<br /><br />But as to my title--wow, I've never read about people drinking so much coffee in my life! And I live in the Pacific Northwest where coffee is like mother's milk to some.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe the movie is better and moves faster, but reading the book was just a slog.
B00985E3UG|5|Very informative and persuasive. The author did a great job researching the marketing techniques of major corporations and was very thorough
B0066WJLU6|1|Didn't order
B00B2V66VS|5|The best game I have ever played. I love this game it is so amazing. I definitely recommend this game.
0307593312|2|Rather bland and pointless book. The main female character is unbelievable; a beautiful, intelligent, young Japanese woman with an avid interest in guns, sex with strangers and middle-aged, balding men (in your dreams Mr. Murakami!). Insipid male character Tengo has no desire to improve his dreary life. Fixation on breasts, sex with minors, and more breasts. I read the book right through to the end assuming that all the loose ends would be tied up and the questions left hanging would be answered but, unfortunately, that was not the case. I still have no idea what the book was about.

B004ZY0VHY|5|It was definitely a page turner.I couldn't put it down. The only bad part was that I guessed the ending about 1/3 of the way into the book.

B001UTW7QU|5|I highly recommend this series for science fiction fans.  This show is about &#34;fringe&#34; science, which is science that is &#34;out there&#34; but is possibly something we could be using very soon.  The action is good, and the actors are good, and the characters have an interesting relationship with each other.
B00JFBCDD2|4|If Amazon allowed for a more nuanced rating system with the ability to give half stars, then I would have given this release three and a half stars. The reason I went ahead and rounded up instead of down is because my love of R.E.M. was born out of one of these unplugged tracks. I know I was familiar with 'Losing My Religion' at the time, but it was only when I saw the performance of the song from the 2001 broadcast that it truly resonated with me and I had to hear it again. So I distinctly remember downloading the studio version off of Kazaa, falling in love with it, and moving on to other songs in the R.E.M. songbook.<br /><br />Both of these sets are really entertaining listens. Multiple people have voiced the opinion in their review that one set easily trumps the other, namely that the one from 1991 is better than the one from 2001, but I think that people only have that perception because of the song selection. The quality of the song performances themselves are actually much more consistent in the 2001 set, but I like the track-list from the 1991 set much better; as do many others, I suspect, which explains the claims of the superiority of the 1991 performance. From my point of view, it's actually the 1991 set that contains all the performance flaws found in this release. As someone else has already mentioned, those background vocals on 'Perfect Circle' are an atrocity. Everywhere else the harmonies and background vocals are terrific, but in this particular song someone is clearly singing outside of their designated vocal register, and it makes for quite the cringe-worthy listen. Someone also pointed to the whistling on 'Endgame' as being irritating. I see why they would say that, but to my ears, only half of the whistling parts sounded off. When the whistling was used as backing for the scat-type vocals, it sounded good to me, but during the whistling parts without the vocals, it definitely sounded like the right execution wasn't there--the proper notes weren't being hit and not enough air was moving through the lips. It didn't completely ruin the whole song for me, though, like on 'Perfect Circle.'<br /><br />Ultimately, there's a lot to like here, but it's mostly for those who have more than just a passing knowledge of the R.E.M. catalog. If you're just a casual fan who likes some of the better known singles, then this release isn't for you; or even if you're a casual fan who wants to get better acquainted with the band, this release still isn't really for you (there's better albums to start with than this one). But if you are already familiar with the band, then I imagine most fans will notch this up as an enjoyable listen. There's so much variety in the song selection--with tracks taken from ten different studio albums, along with b-sides and non-album tracks--meaning you might not like absolutely everything, but you're almost guaranteed to love something. I loved most of it, but what I really loved is that this is essentially a live album that doesn't have any of the attributes I normally find annoying when it comes to live records: namely, there aren't any audience members screaming or whistling mid-song, and there aren't any songs where people start clapping along (which is usually made all the more irritating because not everyone is on-beat).
B009GEBBNQ|5|Avengers are always great.
B006GWO5NE|3|This product was recommended by an Amazon customer service person to fix a charging problem for a kindle fire.  It will charge the kindle, but the problem still exist.  If when plugged in, I set the kindle on the end, with the kindle weight on the cord connection, it charges.  Otherwise, it's will sometimes charge & sometimes will not.  It seems there is a loose connection in the receptable on the kindle.
B000002L9J|5|While it is true that the Smiths were primarily a singles band, &quot;The Queeen is Dead&quot; is a rare example of an album almost completetly perfected. When one looks backs the 80s there simply isn't another album as cohesive as this one.<br />The chemistry between Morrissey and Marr was at its' zenith during the recording of this album. Their songwriting collaborations were the most poignant of their career; songs like 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out,' 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' and 'The Boy with a Thorn in His Side' are among the most well written songs of the entire decade.<br />This album, however, is not flawless. 'Frankly Mr. Shankly' and 'Some Girls' are not mere drivel, but at the same time they do not live up to the standard achieved by the other eight tracks on the album.<br />That all being said, this is a brilliant album with some great melodies and very witty lyrics. Above all though, one can't really appreciate the face of modern British music without hearing this album...several times....
B007SYWFRM|5|very well done my kids love it.. hell even I like it<br />keep up the good work ... I'm looking forward to future games
B009C7ZQM4|5|Helps keep my kindle fine in great shape. It was running a little slow and after running clean master it was so much better.
B003O86FMW|5|It was a great book from start to finish leaving me wanting the answers.<br />I give it a five out of five.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I really like this book. It was fun to have the first-hand account of the three main female characters and piece together the story. I know a few people have said that the story was predictable, and it was a bit, but the fun (for me at least) was how the story began to reveal itself. I was able to figure some things out toward the end of the book (I don't want to give anything away) but the author still threw in some small plot details and surprises to keep me interested. I would recommend it to anyone AND if you like narration option like I do, the three women who do it are very good.
B00NM7K7NI|4|The movie, in and of itself had a few issues, but overall it stayed faithful to the ideal of Godzilla movies. The scale, the special effects, landscape, and two or three massive monsters throwing each other around made for an interesting Godzilla movie.
B00RHYBCN6|5|love it
B00IGVJGYQ|5|Spiderman is a favorite movie and watching it in Blu-ray makes it better.  When it became available, my son was thrilled and it was an easy gift for me.
B009JBZH54|5|is very good, come 5 albums, two movies in Full HD, 2 discs of content, and that the description of the car designs of all of the above films, everything is very well detailed, and comes a disc with the movie Batman begins, along with the content of the movie, in addition the book also comes with the best pictures from the movies, and the presentation is perfect!
B00FAX6XQC|5|Great game. Good controls and it's addicting. It will keep me occupied in my spare time. Only downside so far is that it drains battery fairly quickly.
0740748475|5|I got this collection for my husband who has almost all Calvin and Hobbes comics memorized, but he still had a wonderful time reading them over again. Beatufully put together with author commentary and all. Will be good fun for years.

0765325950|4|If you're already a WoT fan:<br />Read this. Sanderson wraps everything up as Jordan intended and does it at a good pace. If you've waited over a decade for the series to finally be over, pour yourself a nice drink. It's finally done. Also, read the last bit of this review.<br /><br />If you're considering getting into it (or getting someone else into it):<br />WoT is a truly epic series, with a story affected by millenia of lore, filled with a multitude of characters undergoing great change and maturation, and wonderful battles with attention to detail as well as tactical creativity. The series gets a little sluggish towards the end (especially in book 11 - the last one Jordan wrote as he was facing the end of his life), but I implore you to trudge onward as it's a very satisfying and epic read as Sanderson picks up the pace upon taking over and finishes the series out gracefully.<br /><br />Both:<br />Some people will complain about the ending, I'm sure. In my opinion, it was an okay ending. Not great, not bad, just okay. Perhaps it's just hard to wrap up such an amazing and epic story and leave readers both feeling satisfied and not sad the our heroes' journeys have ended. This, along with some slow points in the series in general, is why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5.
B007NU54H4|5|My 10 year old daughter has to whole series.  As a result, I have watched them all with her.  Must admit that this is the best of the series. Great story line,  Excellent quality. Very happy with this purchase.
B0007VNGX0|2|The chorus goes \\"Have you met writer/director Paul WS Anderson? He's the biggest hack in the whole wide world, if there ever was a hack, he'd be the biggest hack, he's a big fat big fat stupid hack! Hack hack hack hack hack hack he's a stupid hack!\\" Well you get the idea.<br /><br /> REA was supposed to be the film that addressed the problems of the ill fated poorly received original RE movie, and while this film is significantly better it still falls flat on its face, and completely lacks the artistic integrity of the game on which it is based.<br /><br /> Jill Valentine, and Nemesis, and a couple others FINALLY appear in an RE movie. That's where the good news ends, however, as the film once again forces this useless Alice character into a spotlight that belonged to Jill, Chris, Leon, and Claire. The movie forces itself into the already complex plot of RE Nemesis (PS1, GCN, DC, PC). Sadly it negates the fantastic frantic storyline of the source material and instead focuses on two moody women who would never get dates in real life because their attitudes make them completely unattractive. Jill and Alice were both written as though they were the same character, and both were played out like they would get into a serious cat fight at the drop of a hat. I didn't buy that Jill would rescue Alice at the end because I never got the impression that they were getting along. But its hard to get along with yourself, really... these two were identical in attitude, tone (which was just awful) and even their posture! Not only that, but Jill in the movie was NOT the Jill from the game. They may have put her in the same costume, gave her the same name, but the way Jill came across in the movie is completely different from her superior video game counter part.<br /><br /> What it boils down to is this, game fans want to see the story of their favorite games brought to the big screen true to form. We never asked for Alice, we don't want Alice, drop kick Alice! Let's make the next one based on the magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script. PWS Anderson is the biggest hack in Hollywood and people need to stop giving that guy projects. He ruins everything he touches. This one's not even worth playing MST3K to.he magnificent RE4, let's get good actors in there, and let's get a writer that can actually write instead of just hack his way through a script.

B005EVVESM|5|The tunes move making this great dance music. But frankly they lessened the quality of their primiere cut, \\"Moves Like Jaggar, by bringing Christina Aguillera in for a cameo. I like her as a solo artist but the song would have been fine without her.
B0058D77S2|1|not for me
B0000584V3|5|What more can I say that has not already been said about this album?  It is pure genius.  This album is a definite must for any true metal fan who really appreciates diversity, great musicianship (especially on the part of Mikael Akerfeldt) progressive and melodic playing and a good blend of hard and soft passages.  Opeth is unlike any other band and believe me, after you listen to their music, you will be hooked like everyone else.  This band has it all.  You will find yourself buying all of their albums after this one.
B004J4WKTW|5|Magical. Stunning. Mesmerizing. Simply enchanting.
B000R7GKQE|5|Came in the mail quickly and in new fantastic shape! I am excited to watch it!
B00AW57L96|5|I love her books! Right until the last page, there are twists and turns which will keep you guessing. A great read.
B000F3A7LE|5|That this was re-released is to me a great gift. This album changed my life, as I was following Robert Fripp and his career after King Crimson disbanded in 1974 or 1975. I was desperately trying to find out what he was up to at that time. In 1979, after reading a story in a magazine that he had been \\"digging ditches\\" somewhere in England, and studying the work of J.G. Bennett, G.I.Gurdjieff and others, I was so intrigued I checked into these authors written work. Then, during his Frippertronics tour in 1979, I was able to see him perform live in a small record store in Atlanta. Back to the \\"product\\", sorry...the album is a wonderful composite and indication of what and where Robert and some of his collegues were \\"at\\" in their music, and their inner lives, and so much more. On the albums in this limited edition of \\"Exposure\\", are the First Edition, remastered 24 bit and sounding crisper and finer than ever. We hear the likes of Robert throughout with his unique and wonderous sounds he makes with his guitars and his modified tape decks. Also appearing on the album are the exquisite talents of Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall, Peter Hamill of \\"Van der Graf Generator\\", Tony Levin, Terre Roche, and many others including excerpts of recordings of talks given by J.G. Bennett which are very instructive and compelling. The second disc is the Third Edition, with bonus tracks. Very Exciting stuff to listen to, and to \\"be\\" with. Highly recommended for Fripp fans and anyone seeking music and media that inspires the seeker of meaning in Life.
B001CD6MA6|4|VERY COLORFUL MOVIE. If you liked speed racer cartoons as a kid, this is a great adult remake for you and your kids.  It received poor reviews in the cinema, but there is no accounting for taste. I did not watch speed racer as a kid, nor did I go to the movie theater with my husband, son and his 18yo friends, but they loved it, as does my teenage daughter and her friends.  So I bought 2, one for her to take to college and one for our home library.
B007XKEY6Q|5|This is my favorite game. After you play for awhile some of the words get repeated but it's a light fun way to play a game at your leisure with people you know.

B000GIXEIG|2|Beowulf, is a heroic epic poem which has been orally transmitted through the ages finally written down by monks and retold again and again for its memorable battles and beloved heroes. Both Christians and Pagans alike have found in its 3,182 lines something to relate to and believe in, and many 9th graders have dreaded the pop quizzes it has generated for years.<br /><br />This movie \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is just one In a long line of interpretations (there is an animated version in the same style as the Polar Express coming out in 2007) It stars Gerard Butler (Phantom of the Opera, Tomb Raider, 300) Stellan Skarsgard (Ronin, Amistad, Good Will Hunting) Tony Curran (Underworld 2, The Good German) and Sarah Polley (Dawn of the Dead, The Sweet Hereafter)<br /><br />The movie starts out with King Hrothgar (Skarsgard) killing a troll for reasons unknown and leaving the trolls hairy little boy to live. The little boy chops his fathers head off , Mrs Vorhees style, and basically lives in a cave with it , sorta like Tom Hanks and the Volleyball in Castaway. A grown Grendel then waits till the good King erects a massive beer hall and then proceeds to massacre all the warriors and eat them. In the Poem, Grendel decides to kill them because they are just making too much noise and he was a hideous outcast who basically wasn't invited to the party. This is where the film starts taking on a story of its own, completely deviating from the historical poem entirely. Beowulf (Butler), who lives in Geatland, comes to King Hrothgars aide with a handful of braided warriors.<br /><br />The king feigns cluelessness as to why Grendel is eating a Dane Buffet, so Beowulf turns to the local witch/wench. Selma (Polley) is an affront to the Beowulf legend, first of all Polley decides not to even have an accent, instead using her Canadian one. She can see your future death, she has red nappy hair, and she looks like she doesn't want to be there, Secondly there was no woman like her in the poem what so ever. Did they really need a love interest? She admits to being a prostitute, she can understand Grendels language of grunts, and she obviously thinks Beowulf is hot. Grendel doesn't want to kill Beowulf, because he hasn't been harmed by him and BW wants to know why he wants to hurt the King and his subjects, the king however will offer up no explanation. A Geat warrior (Curran) stomps on Grendels daddys head and then he gets peeved, comes to get him and ends up losing his arm (Just like in the Poem) and dies from the wound. Beowulf and his Peeps are then set upon by Grendels Mother. She is a sea hag; with some serious calve muscles, and Beowulf ends up killing her in her lair. There he finds a child guarding Grendels body, which we find out is Grendels child by Selma, they had a nice romantic grunting minute together years back. Beowulf honors Grendel as a warrior, gets his own time with Selma because who hasn't?, and leaves, which basically confused the crud out of me.<br /><br />There is much more to the movie I realize, but why tell this tale and completely make up 99% of it to suite your needs? It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good either. Between Selma's Non accent and Grendel feeling randy it lost its heroic beautiful meaning. Gerard Butler is an amazing actor, but he gets glossed over by badly choreographed fights, and a plotline so wierd it felt like a terrible SciFi channel mess. Don't bother buying or renting this if you have any appreciation for the original.the poem what so ever. Did they really need a love interest?

0553278223|4|Here is one of the highest examples of the sci-fi genre.  Social commentary on the human race in the form of fiction about made-up beings from another planet.  This is an almost flawless demonstration of the art form.  Dated, but that only makes it more charming.  Bradbury's Martians are superior to men (more sensitive, more warrior-like, more artistic, more philosophical, more cultured, more advanced, more intelligent) while at the same time not possessing any attributes that are not common to men (see the foregoing list).  The synopsis is: humans repeatedly attempt to colonize Mars, only to be initially frustrated by successful defenses by the Martians.  The Martians use telepathic mind games, old-fashioned gunfighting, and plain ol' marital jealousy to delay the inevitable for a few years.  But we keep coming, and we turn the New World into a interplanetary suburb in short order.  Eventually, after we've ruined Mars (like, goes this story line, the white man ruins everything), we answer the call to return to an Earth devasted by the stereotypical total nuclear (or \\"atomic\\") war.  But this synopsis is like summarizing 'Gone With The Wind' as a Civil War book.  Great one, not to be missed.
B007P06DOK|5|Words cannot adequately describe the emotions that come forth in the CD as the people of South Africa struggle to survive in so many ways.  His respect and genuine empathy for the music, the culture and the people of South Africa comes through like in ways that are indescribably.  This CD should be required listening in all music classes in all schools across America!!!!!
B0097HSS4M|5|Better than any other editor! It is definitely worth the money! I have been looking for a photo editor for so long and I finally found one!
B006885FZI|4|If you like WWII era movies and mini series you will certainly enjoy this wonderful series by HBO.  In the same quality of Band of Brothers.  The actors are certainly likable but I found myself liking The Band of Brothers more.  I watch the Band of Brothers at least once each year.  I have watched this series only twice.  It is worth watching.
B00EHMFC78|4|Well written book but too long.
B007Z9QP3K|5|Das Boot is a long film but to capture the boring time in war it has to be.  The action scenes are really gut twisters.  It is funny that you get favorites among the crew.  I do not know of a better submarine movie.
B003TT2X72|5|Classic movie in gr8 quality Blu-ray!
B000FC1HBY|5|Love it!
B004GJDQT8|5|Very good
B0074VA2T2|4|My 3 year old really likes this app. I wish that the levels would progressively get hard by itself. You currently have to change difficulties by hand. Not a big problem, but I have to switch the levels after a while to keep my son's attention.
B00005JMCN|4|Good story, but the language was a little strong in some parts. I even bought this one for my son-in-law, who loves movies about horses.
B00J1IQUYM|4|It was a unique combination of post apocalyptic and flashbacks of characters. I am not sure what I expected, but this was overall a pleasant read.
B009LDXQGW|5|This Trilogy is just awesome! I def love it! I downloaded the three albums a year ago maybe when they had it on his page for free and decided to buy it because I need to keep it in my music library!
B00BPDR3F6|5|I could not put this book down. Elizabeth Gilbert's writing is a pleasure to dive into. The subject matter is fascinating , loved the story. Another home run for Elizabeth Gilbert.
B00M7URUUE|2|Skipable
B006ICGH56|5|Fantastic acting, quality writing, sumptuous cinematography, memorable period and original music; how can you not recommend the movie that has everything?
B0009P5YXO|5|This is great i love just popping out my screwdriver and just pointing it at things, its great to write hidden messages and just reveling it to people a definite gift to any Whovian
B000005H7D|5|Every serious jazz collection should have this disc. One of his own favourites. Buy This!!!
B00005B36H|5|Incredible.  I listened to the whole thing last night at midnight when I bought it.  It just keeps getting better and better.
B000063DFN|4|plays well . Little &#34;rougher &#34;than described , but still happy with purchase.

B0064MPXFA|4|If you missed the series, and want something relatively interesting, but light, this is a good view. The script, and the acting are entertaining.
B00000IQW5|5|I have \\"always\\" loved this movie and couldn't find it in stores.  So....went to Amazon to find it so I could have my own copy.  Thanks for offering this.
B004FOA84A|4|This game is relatively challenging. Graphics are well done. The only downside is it's too short. Wish there was another game that takes up where this one leaves off.
B003TOPQI0|5|Great movie. One of my all-time favorites to watch. Brad Pitt is a great actor in this movie and he does a great job speaking pigeon.
0375842209|5|It is a rare thing for me to be compulsive about a book; a book that, when you are not actively reading it, occupys your mind, where you can't wait for a free moment to return to the story.  _The Book Thief_ did this to me.  The characters were compelling, the writing was beautiful, the story had me mesmerized, and the narrator, well, the narrator had my complete and rapt attention.<br /><br />_The Book Theif_ is about the four years of young Lisel Meminger's life between childhood and adulthood.  It is also about her growing up in Nazi Germany, witnessing the evil perpetrated during that time and learning about right and wrong.  Narrated by Death, (an interesting choice, I thought, although certainly a neutral observer), the broader philosophical issues of morality and guilt are addressed:  is it moral to steal books?  food?  Jews?  Should one feel guilty for these acts?  For becoming (or not becoming) apart of the Nazi machine?  Should one feel guilty for surviving these horrible times?  Deep questions, to be sure; Zusak, however, is a brilliant enough writer to ask these questions subtly.<br /><br />On the topic of the brilliance of the writing - Zusak's writing is powerful and beautiful.  Its been a long, long time since I outright bawled reading a novel.  I did so with _The Book Thief_.  I was literally emotionally wrung out at the completion of the story.  This book without doubt warrants five stars.  Suitable for young adults?  As with so many things, it depends on the young adult; still, an exceptional read with my highest recommendation.
B00U7VDC7A|4|Fun game. Easy
B00994WQ78|5|This was my first time seeing this movie. After all these years, Spaceballs is Still funny. So funny and so very relevant. Mel Brooks never disappoints
B008Y5NGG8|5|Loved this movie.  Superb acting.  Did it want it to end!!!
B001MYIXAC|5|One of THE best vampire movies ever!  Loved it!  In the top 100 list of Horror Movies!  I highly recommend it:)
B005MLOKXA|5|My wife and I had never watched this series, but heard so many good things about it from friends that we decided to give it a try.  We started with season 1 and are now in the middle of season 2 with no plans to stop until we are caught up.  This is a great show and we really enjoy the recurring characters.  We also enjoy the absence of commercials, making each episode under 43 minutes.  Julianna Margulies is outstanding.  Highly recommended.
B0002XH9Z4|5|never in history has there been an entertainer with the stage presence the, ora the MAGIC that Michael has... forget anything you've heard, forget the tabloid junk that people toss back and forth about Michael before anything else he is and always will remain to be the KING OF POP.. a legend in music dance and entertainment Michael is one of the most influential artist of the century..  In my eyes he will always be the greatest entertainer of all time.. with his magical, performing talent he mesmerizes you in his dancing and special effects,  His performance of human nature and man in the mirror nearly drives me insane!.. with this dvd it is proven yet again why Michael is an icon, a legend and the one and only KING OF POP! <br />Get your copy if anything for the DVD, as well as some great un released material....
B003OF3R0S|4|I really like this album!
B000WC39SG|5|Updated version of many before this story  It does have funny moments serious and moments This was a good movie to watch more than once
B009PU2KIQ|4|Gary Clark Jr. is a triple threat. He's an exceptional lyricist, great guitar player, and a very good singer. I really like this Texas rock album although I am magnetized to The Life every time I listen. Overall, this album is great, very well put together and very professionally made. Get the deluxe version, the ending song culminates it all and is very beautiful. Overall, Gary Clark Jr. has created something very special and this is definitely in my top 5 albums for 2012.
B002SSUQFG|5|This watch is smaller than I expected, despite all the review saying so.  However, my favorite size is around 38mm, so this is close!  This is an understated watch, not flashy or showy.  It's a watch that does what it is designed to do, and does it well.<br /><br />I've had it on my wrist for two weeks now and it hasn't gained or lost a second.  I'm not joking.  I set it the day after i received it and managed to get it pretty much spot on (second hand is 8 seconds fast) and it hasn't changed at all in two weeks.  I was surprised and perhaps I was lucky enough to get a great copy.<br /><br />I don't have much experience, but the lume on this is outstanding.  It's easy to read in the middle of the night when I get up to use the bathroom.  My wife even noticed in the middle of the night and asked me the next morning if my watch was glowing!<br /><br />This is my first automatic and I can't complain.  If you have smaller wrists or like a more classic proportion for your watch this is a nice way to go for a low cost.<br /><br />I have no complaints, at all.  That is rare.  I'm a pretty picky guy!
B0014U4X3U|5|I have given this to one of my grandchildren -- unfortunately before I could figure out how to use the Paperwhite.
0425263908|4|Bared to you was a good book and very similar to fifty shades of grey, so if you liked 50 shades i'd recommend it... however, bared to you became a bit repetitive on certain areas.. i think Sylvia was so focused on the exotic sexual relationship between Gideon and Eva that she missed a lot of detail and story itself.. the book goes - random writing, sex sex sex sex, random, sex sex, random, sex sex sex.. i mean, the first couple of times its fun but then it becomes too common that i kinda just skipped over it and since there was a lot of it, i skipped more pages than i would have liked to. The story of how they met and Eva's past and a sneak peak of Gideon's was good and if she would have added of that to the book i would have liked it more. She didn't reveal all of Gideon's past which is why i'd be willing to read the second but i hope the second involves more of a story than just sex writing. But overall, i don't regret reading it and i would recommend it
B008RJFRTK|3|useful
B00HV2KPNW|5|Captivating plot, funny, and great soundtrack! We had to buy it because the kids want to watch it over and over again.
B0019T9FL6|5|I love this CD. I have waited a long time for her debut. I like that she has something to appeal to all genres: Soul, R&B, Gospel, Rap, etc. There is a song for everyone, sung by an absolutely powerful voice. My favorites are Spotlight, Giving Myself, You Pulled Me Through, Go Away, I'm His Only Woman and Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There. And I disagree with the comment that said Pocketbook was unnecessary. It was a funny song. I totally got the song. But to each their own! I think Clive Davis did a phenomenal job with this CD and he definitely had the talent to make it work. Jennifer, you are a God given talent. Prayers to you and her family! The storm is here now for you but it won't last always.
B002SAUCBC|5|This is an interesting and captivating story set in an alternate universe America. The military seems to hold a lot of power, the economic health of the country is poor and crowds of people find a sick pleasure in watching (and betting money on) 100 teenage boys walk for hundreds of miles under the threat of death.<br /><br />Very well done book as always by Stephen King.
B00F0LV22E|3|A bit long winded and drawn out  .... Took some time to finish this story because of this. Wasn't compelled to read on ... However hate not finishing a story so read to completion, but dragged my heels :)
B001ANSS5K|5|Green is amazing.<br />He knows exactly what to say to make your heart feel like it'll explode out of your chest.
B00CL6HGIK|2|The story line was hard to follow. I think this is a great book that I never read.But as a movie, it is too short to cover the material. The plot twists and mix ups were covered too quickly, and they're important. The acting was great the actors did well but they jjust didn't get enough time to develop the story better.
B00902S0IS|5|I originally saw Forbidden Planet when it was released in the mid 1950's. It was the Star Wars of its era and nothing came close until Stanley Kubrick's 2001 in the late 60's. The science fiction was excellent for the time and the movie's premise still holds today - we all have our secret (and sometimes not so secret) &#34;ID&#34;. In other words, all of us as humans have a Self centered Independent Nature (SIN). As the movie says, &#34;That's why we have rules and religion&#34; (to attempt to keep things in check and under control). This is a thinking person's film while also being entertaining and visually stunning. The special effects still hold their own as does the electronic music - a first in the 50s. Well worth watching. Yes, some of the plot is silly and juvenile but the underlying theme of the effect human nature has on our choices and actions is accurate and insightful. I own the video as well.
030745455X|5|loved this book.  second in the trilogy, but soon as i finished it i had to read the third book it left you in an exciting place.  this author can really spin a plot. be prepared to want to read these three books in one sitting.
B004XWMXW4|5|If one cello is great, the two cellos has to be twice as good, but it is even better than that. Get ready to sit back and have your ears tingle to the great strings. Don't pass this one up.
B00E8KLWB4|5|This game is by far one of the best hidden object games I have played recently. It is fun and interactive as well as entertaining.
B00H5KRPD8|5|Seriously creepy but very good
B009WO7NQO|5|Super graphics, good sound, lotes of challanges. Getting bonuses and star fighters is really cool. not sure how the bonus planets works but I'll figure it out.<br />jim
B008NEMPTO|2|This movie is a mess.  I'm not sure if this film had any plot or story to it, just an instructional film on how to slice and dice vampires, or zombies, or whatever they are!  Conventional vampires with their tried and true foils they are not, but blood thirsty zombies that Abe Lincoln cuts down with his trusty axe.  Tim Burtons continual use of slow motion cuts during action sequences begins to get boring and quite annoying very quickly, and the color of the whole film seems to be washed out, almost as though it was shot in a Sepia tone.  The only thing I found good about the film was the 3D imagery, whether it was shown on a 3D television or viewed through the 3D Video Wizard.  If you like blood, gore and severed heads, this film is for you!
B000002KHF|5|Bought this CD solely for the song \\"Brand New Day\\".  Absolutely love the entire CD.  Great music, and brings  back many memories.  Highly recommend it.
B00B5HQLMI|4|Very good continuation of the Bond series. Though it was a bit tedious a times. The villan was certainly unique and his endeavors as well. Knowing the outcome would be predictable, Bond wins!, made the process seem slightly tedious. The loss of M was unavoidable due to the post release pub. It was still,however, saddening.
B00PTB7B34|5|Very good game
B00005JL0I|1|This alleged spoof of Bond films is outright stuporous.  Absolutely nothing works here.  I found my attention waning while watching this film and having to pinch myself to stay awake.  I think I drew blood.  There are wall-to-wall \\"gags\\" here and none of them are funny.  It took five count 'em five directors and three screenwriters to concoct this abomination and it shows.  There is no fluency in the direction and the story is downright incoherent.  The film's few saving graces is that David Niven and Peter Sellers escape with their reputations intact.  There's a pretty good Bacharach-David score here but too bad it's not in the service of a better picture.  Ian Fleming must be rolling in his grave.
B005FDW7AI|5|Love this movie. Possibly my favorite movie as a child and still a top as an adult. I could barely watch the shirley temple one. This version is so much better.
B0069G5Z9K|5|omg best game ever! there is nice action fifteenth stones and of course fun. if I were you GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005LAII0S|3|Good movie, but subtract 2 stars because digital copy is not compatible with ultraviolet (probably worthless for non-apple-TV folks).
B007JUWM64|4|I really enjoyed this movie. It was action-packed and fun. If I would've known it was this good, I would've seen it at the movies first.
B005CA4SJW|5|Merry Christmas to me! Big fan (although senior female) of Walking Dead and was surprised and very happy when sons gave me this.
B008JFUQ3O|5|Best Despicable movie yet!  Hoping for a sequel!
B00UENHBAU|5|it is so good I have been waiting night 4 is pretty hard but still fun though so you should buy it if you are a gnat fan
0345350499|5|I was engrossed with this book but I noticed an underlying thread to it that disturbed me. This book is supposed to be the Arthurian legend written in the women's point of view. Despite the message that religious bias is not good, the hidden message is that the men in this book seemed to be far better at judging reality than the women. The women in this book manipulate and contrive in sometimes nasty and petty ways to try to keep the \\"old Goddess religion\\" as the main religion. They refuse to see that the tide is turning and that changes have come to their land. The men characters are more realistic and practical. Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote the men as being more astute about how their world was changing and how to adapt to those changes.     In this way, I have to say this book is not feminist at all. The women seem all too petty, too willing to resort to squabbling over the men and very unwilling to be practical about the changes they are experiencing. I would guess that MZB had a subconscious dislike of women because of how childish and foolish she portrays them.     If this is truly how women really think, is it any wonder we have been maligned by men for centuries? This book has some beautiful parts, but the underlying threads of stupid unaware women, who are totally engrossed in their mean fights over the men in the story, made it unpalatable at times.     Alas, Mists is a book about a LEGEND.  Legends are NOT truth, they are stories about things that may have a small grain of truth in them, but that get embellished many times over the centuries. That means Mallory, Monmouth, Stewart, Bede, Eschenbach, all wrote STORIES, not truths. There is no primary source for the Arthurian legends, the closest we have was written in the 9th (or 11th century,) 400 (or 600) years later, by a monk named Nennius.  Even his works are not considered proof because they are not primary sources.     Mists Of Avalon is  only one more in a long line of Arthurian Myth/Cycle/Legend books with the new twist of telling the story from both the women's and some Pagans' points of view.      I couldn't put it down, and it did make me want to do research into the NeoPagan religions.  Not recommended for younger kids, there's some violence, rape, graphic sexual scenes, and some parts can seem anti-religious. Enthralling read, but keep in mind, it isn't real, there are no records of how Pagans really acted back then and the hidden messages about stupid women are in there.
B00IK590UI|4|I actually liked this film, the action was pretty solid and inventive, sex were great. As for the social commentary its a bit different from the original. The first film was a biting  commentary on 80s excess, corruption and what it means to be human, this film was actually about the illusion of freedom and security. I wish the film were alot longer so it can delve deeper into the topic. Plus i wish many of the more interesting characters had more screen time to expand themselves.<br /><br />Good flick none the less.
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Great book. Not what you would expect at all! I can't wait to read the rest of her books.
B0026BD2GK|5|Thanks, it is a good condition.
B00QROH0QK|5|Good movie.
B00F522C7C|4|We got this because it's a good movie and all.  It's nice that it came with the digital copy so I don't have to get the dvd all the time, and having the dvd is good when the internet is out or if we are traveling.
B00DVKOYBM|5|I've played a lot of pool game online and on arcade games but this 8 ball pool is truly the best that I came across. If your the type that enjoys playing pool then your gonna absolutely love this game!!!

B0047Y0FGY|5|Being a commuter for my job, I enjoy audio books.  I listened to Tina read this book.  It was SO funny that once I had to turn it off for a few minutes because I was just laughing way to hard to drive.<br /><br />I haven't enjoyed a book this laugh-out-loud funny in years.  Thank you, Tina Fey.  Just this week I practiced the \\"Irish Good-night\\" with some friends who wouldn't leave........still laughing!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Good movie
B009UNGYHG|1|Do not buy this case to charge your headset!!!!  I wish I could return it!!!!  No matter how hard I try, I can never figure out when I put the headset in the box if it is charging or not as the light system that they use to let you know if it is charging of blinking lights is poor in design.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many times I have put the headset in the box to charge thinking that it is charging only to find out that it did not charge the headset.<br /><br />This is not like Plantronics products!! The headset is the best and I love it with the exception that they left the micro charge for a proprietary charge port held on by a magnet.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you buy the cord charger instead that works perfectly all the time and you can see the charging light on the headset itself (when in the case you cannot).
1781161313|3|I very much appreciated the depth of the written presentation. My biggest complaint is the many juvenile photos and artwork (sketches really).
B00KGRGJAC|5|I read the book many years ago and did not know about this movie until a recent comparison someone made in a review of a different movie. I quickly did a search and had to watch this very well done movie.  You get a real view of life in Russia, the difficulties that the detectives must deal with, the lack of tools, lack of technology, and red tape is almost shocking.  I am glad that (for the most part), most of the violent acts are left to your imagination, from the autopsies performed you already know what terrible acts have taken place, no need to see it painfully acted out, I don't have the stomach for that, they do give enough glimpses to drive home the brutality. The relationship building between the forensic specialist turned lead detective and his commanding officer is key to finally apprehending the serial killer.  The Lead detective gains the respect of the field detectives and a real Team emerges.  But it all takes years and many young lives before the serial killer is captured,  the film does a great job of keeping you immersed as the Lead detective desperately attempts to bring some outside knowledge to the team, even profiling by bringing in a psychiatrist to the case, is a historical event at this period in Russia.
B00000K0DQ|5|Acting is good. Lots of good actors in this. Can keep your attention no problem. Worth owning. Glad I bought it.
B00J9IH1RO|3|Wanted Skype on the kindle, and this came up first, it is not Skype, but just a way to pay for public wifi, so not what I wanted....I think it could be clearer!<br />Needless to say the Skype for android does not work on the new kindles, as they are too customized, but that is another issue.
B00L9B7IKE|3|This book was a book club read and most of our members did not like the book at all.  I, on the other hand, thought that the writer did an awesome job of being in the heads of all these dysfunctional characters. It was difficult in the beginning to figure out what the relationship was of all the characters, and the timeframe jumping was confusing to many of our readers.  After much discussion about the dark side of the book, we were left with one unanswered question.  Did Anna or Rachael ever reveal to the police who killed Megan or was the crime left unsolved?  The last 100 pages were the best part of the book.  I would compare this book to Gone Girl which I enjoyed equally.
B004K4AVAG|3|I'm a Lady Gaga fan but wasn't that thrilled with this CD as I was her first CD - however for those die-hard fans, still recommend adding this to your collection
B002RVCD6O|1|I kept thinking it would get better.     No, it was a complete waste of the 2 dollar fee to view it.    The movie had no point, a thin plot, the only thing that happened of any import was at the end.    Don't waste your time, don't buy this turkey, pretend it never happened.
B00E72OKAS|5|Great game very addicting
B005FITIDC|5|An excellent movie. well scripted and believable. What an awesome story about a man who wanted to make a difference. well portrayed by Gerard Butler showing his huge acting skills range. It is sad that man is so inhuman to children. A story that needed to be told.
B006GWO5NE|5|The charger worked  better than anything I have used to date. The device exceded my expectation. Thank you amazon.<br />Ted Wold
B009UX2YAC|5|This is a really great game for all ages, very fun and enjoyable. This is a bright and colourful interpretation of term or run it offers much more skill and technical capability but is much more fun! I would definitely recommend this product, it is highly addictive and ful  of fun features which make this game fun and enjoyable. The graphics are to an extremely high quality and there is lots of colour. This is definitely an app to download!
B000UX6THK|5|The remastered video and audio are excellent, the menus are well-done, but most of all, the content is wonderful. Watching these discs reminded me of why I loved this show so much when it was originally on the air. It is too bad it only ran for two seasons.
B00EXTQV70|3|A strange, interesting, and intriguing, stream of conscious tale of a man's search for meaning in his life and meaning in the death of his father. After someone seems to take over his internet life, a dentist, who easily falls in love with the families of the women he dates, searches for meaning in his own life, his Red Sox superstitions, and his desire to find his place in the world. He tries to figure out what his spiritual beliefs are, why they are, and he tries to make sense of the spirituality and religious beliefs of the people around him.
1439156816|5|More than I expected! Love that 2 books in 1, personal story with style guide! I was always scared of Stephen King, this book gave me a different understanding of the man and his work!
B007KOYEOC|3|This book is OK, but not as good as the first two. It gets boring from time to time and very predictable.
B003M6EAXM|5|I didn't want to get into this show when it first aired because I thought the concept was hackneyed and that the plot would move at a snail's pace, given that each hour represented only one hour in a given day.  My father tried to get me to watch it because he loved it and that was another reason I was suspect of it.<br /><br />I'm glad I finally took the plunge.  24 is an engaging thriller of a show with plenty of surprises.  I am almost all the way through with season 8, just in time for 24 to return to television in May.
B00K7C17QW|5|Awesome game! Slow because I don't purchase things, but it is fun!
B00003CXFV|4|Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), a hard-working single mother, manages to get hired as a lawyer's assistant and ends up spearheading a multi-million-dollar civil suit against PG&E.  Though not in the same league as a great film like the similarly-themed \\"Silkwood,\\" I found this to be an entertaining and satisfying tale of the little guy triumphing against the system.  Roberts is very good as a tough, tired, disappointed woman who flaunts what she sees as her only asset--her physical beauty.  Albert Finney fleshes out the underwritten role of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry.  The character of George, however, is a misstep.  He is some kind of working woman's fantasy man--a tough, good-looking biker who is also sensitive, domestic, and good with kids.  He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.  Aaron Eckhardt never really figures out what to do with the part.  Nevertheless, it's an entertaining film.
B008GXHOFW|5|This is a cool game I think all ages kids elders and adults should give this game a try the free roam is super amazing I hope you enjoy this game
0345535529|5|Addictive to son who reads voraciously! Came in perfect shape
B003EYVXTQ|5|Jennifer Lawrence is the best film actress to come along in a generation.  Never saw her work until Silver Lining Playbook, then went back and watched Hunger Games and this one.  All I can say is -- wow!
B00H7MW3HC|5|There is not one song that I didn't love. This is a CD you will play over and over. A Thousand Years (love it!) is not on it but is on Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn 2 which I purchased also.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun and addictive.
B0094LUFY2|4|Zoe Saldana is really fantastic in this film! This is an intense movie, but one that will surely entertain you.
B00005JPUN|2|2 stars because I save 1 star for films that are absolutely horrible and this film is not quite that bad [but almost].I have not seen the original, but the first paragraph in the February 15 review by David Jenkins sums up THIS film very succinctly.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Works great!!
B009UX2YAC|4|the game its incredible good but i lose my advance twice except for the high score I never recover the progress
B00000IQBM|5|wonderfully directed, acted, and written, the shining is a true masterpiece in film. it is one of the few films that can be scary yet not lame. the only thing that could have made it better would be if stephen  king actually assisted in writing the screenplay. the movie is far from the  book yet it still possesses a certain magnificence. people, quit whining  about the DVD's change to 4:3 because THAT WAS THE WAY KUBRICK WANTED IT.  the only sad thing about this is that kubrick died before we could get the  original ending to the film. but still, it is a classic
B00L9B7IKE|4|I stayed interested enough to finish, but it was kind of depressing.
B00KZ6WRAA|4|Nice app and good synchronization of chat between Facebook app and this one.
B00005R5G9|4|the quality of dvd is good. and played successfully . this film is unvailable in australia, i have been trying and searching for   manniquin 2 , can you help or source it out
0596805888|3|There is some good information about the science of cooking in this book, but you have to do a bit of searching to find it. It would be a better book if it were shorter and better organized. If I had it to do over again, I would have bought a different book on the subject.
015603252X|5|A modern classic. A history lesson, a love story to the past, a travelogue of the 20th century diaspora. Even if you aren't Jewish or interested in Israel, this book will hook you in, and you will be (well, not Jewish, but...).
B000J3OTSM|5|Movie is Awesome:) Channing off the wall Dancer, as well as Hot;)
B000VBJEFK|5|This is a must buy for anyone with a Blu-Ray player. Great flick, but add in amazing picture quality and fantastic surround sound. The features are really cool to play around with. Great for all ages.
B000002B35|5|Yet, I'll give it a go. I bought the CDs mainly due to the performance of Comfortably Numb (which is absolutely the best guitar solo ever!) but it is so much more than just one song. Especially Disc 2(from Dark Side Of The Moon). A must buy. David Gilmour has created a real masterpiece. It really is indescribable. Next, I'm definitely getting hold of the DVD.
B003P2WO5E|4|***NO SPOILERS***<br /><br />The Way of Kings was an outstanding novel and a great introduction to an intricately crafted world. The story was terrific, the pacing excellent. Even the interludes (which I normally hate in a book) were timed right and added to the story without bogging it down.<br /><br />I cruised through this 1000 page novel actually wanting more to read. As I neared the end I began to realize that I would miss this world and these characters until the release of the next volume.<br /><br />I do have a couple points of contention (which is why no 5 star review).<br /><br />1. Too often Sanderson would incorporate comedy by means of twisted grammar. An example was a joke about insult and \\"in slut\\". While this might read well it tends to ruin immersion and makes the reader focus on the author as if he is nodding and winking at you, \\"see what I did there?\\".<br /><br />2. A character in the story (Wit)told the main character (Kalidan) to do something which seemed pretty important. The issue was never addressed again and it was almost as if Sanderson forgot to include the resolution of that conversation. In a novel this dense I can understand how it may have turned up missing but it was a nagging issue that I couldn't fully get over.<br /><br />All in all amazing book that marks the rise of the new Epic Fantasy master. Bravo Brandon!
B00008PW3Q|4|Their last really great album was Tango in the Night, which was imo one of their very best albums ever. While Say you Will is not near that masterpiece, it is a nice comeback album. It does maintain that classic Fleetwood Mac Feeling, but it does feel a bit more like seperate efforts by Nicks and Buckingham, and personally I`m belonging to the Nicks base, and in this case, I found myself rooting more for Nicks songs, making the album a little bit black and white. Thats not saying Buckingham`s songs are bad, not at all. While \\"Whats the World coming too\\" is a bit too cliched in its musical build, \\"Murrow turning over in his grave\\" is interesting enough. The Typical voice of Nicks is instantly recognized in Illume, but it seems more like a pre \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" song than a Fleetwood Mac, and thats what I think is the problem with this album. The songs are all nice, but none feel really Fleetwood Mac with influences by Nicks and Buckingham, but the other way around, they feel like seperate songs by Nicks and Buckingham, with elements of Fleetwood Mac.   Nicks does have the upper hand though, as more of her songs and mood feels like Fleetwood Mac, something that is really evident in \\"Thrown Down\\", a superb song, and it could easily have been on the \\"Tango in the Night\\" album.  In a possible attempt to capture that old good feeling from Tango in the Night, Buckingham serves the song \\"Miranda\\" which has an opening about identical to \\"Big Love\\", except that \\"Miranda\\" comes off as a really boring song, and once you are aware of the similarities, it only becomes worse compared to the classic. However, on the next song, \\"Red Rover\\", Buckingham does it better, and I like the song even though it sounds a bit strange to put it that way. Original at least, I`ll give him that.     \\"Say you will\\" is the next song, penned by Nicks. Classic Nicks, less classic Fleetwood Mac, still a good song, with a nice chorus(How can you expect less from her). \\"Peacekeeper\\", the next song byBuckingham, is also good, but unlike Nicks, he doesnt manage to get the choruses right, and they end up feeling a little bit cliched(With that I mean, all the chords comes where you suspect, there are no real hooks or uniqueness to it). \\"Come\\" starts interesting. It is a bit haunting, with its almost ripple-like sound(You gotta hear it to understand), but it takes off with a strange and messy middlepart that ruins the song before going back to the strange and hypnotic mood. Still, Thumbs up.   \\"Smile at you\\" by Nicks is way too much typical Nicks and way too little Fleetwood Mac, and its not very good Nicks either unfortunately.    However...The next song: \\"Running Through the Garden\\" is the star of the Show. Might not be Fleetwood Mac stuff, but its Nicks at the top of her game, doing what she does best. Creating biting and sharp lyrics, wrapped with a superb and catchy melody, with Nicks lovely voice on top of it all. If this cd was the only way I could have gotten this song, and even if it had nothing more on it, I`d still pay double up just to get it. No wonder why we love Nicks.    Stepping down a few notches is done with \\"Silver Girl\\" by Nicks. A relaxed hybrid between Nicks and Fleetwood Mac, its a nice song, while not special. \\"Steal your Heart Away\\" is a decent song by Buckingham, but honestly, I think he is a bit too sweet in this song, but he makes up for it with \\"Bleed to Love Her\\", a nice song. Going back to Nicks, with \\"Everybody Finds out\\" and \\"Destiny Rules\\". The first one is not really good, and could have been left out for all I cared, and the same goes for the second, where she uses the worse style of her vocals, and the song is just not any good.     For the two last songs, there can be no doubt. Buckingham`s \\"Say Goodbye\\" and Nicks \\"Goodbye Baby\\" in an all last attempt to win the hearts. Nicks crushes Buckingham so hard that its almost painful. While \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is not as beautiful as her \\"When I see her Again\\", its still one of the very best songs on this album. I swear, if Nicks wrote a stripped down album consisting of songs like this, it would be one of the most beautiful albums ever, something Goodbye Baby prooves.     To sum it all up, I recommend this album. As long as you dont expect the good old Fleetwood Mac sound, and that you can accept the two quite different styles scattered around on this album, you will most likely enjoy this album. There are songs here that can be heard over and over, and songs that just is skipped, and after a few rounds you should have been able to pinpoint a 5-8 songs you want to listen to over and over, while the rest is just okay. Still, Fleetwood Mac is Fleetwood Mac, no matter how much Buckingham or Nicks individualize it, and it IS a good album.
B000092ZYX|5|Radiohead is good because no one else could ever be like them. If you can find one group that comes even close to their style please enlighten me. If you followed radiohead from their start till now each album has been distinct and well orchestrated to an extent like no other band. I will admit it would take a certain person to like radiohead. Unfortunately those people seem to be far and few between. But for us who love radiohead they are seen as a gift to music and an inspiration that will never die. Get HAIL TO THE THIEF AND NEVER WILL YOU BE DISSATISFIED WITH MUSIC AGAIN.

0545101417|4|This is a very entertaining book.  It follows on Susan Collins' first book and picks up right where the first book left off.  It is as much fun the first book, The Hunger Games.  I had the audio version and listened to it during a 15 hour drive.  It kept me interested for the entire drive.
B00BHMF578|4|Great telling of a suspenseful story.
0439023491|5|This book holds it's own as a follow up to The Hunger Games.  Amazing story for any age.  Fantastic characters old and new!  I have yet to meet a person who doesn't love it.  My daughter (14) & I have read it multiple times and love it.  I have suggested this series to over 30 people from 12-65 years old and have never heard anything but rave reviews.  Leaves you on pins & needles for the 3rd book!
B000FZETIO|5|great movie  great music
B00DPM7RJW|5|I love Ridge and Sydney! This is my favorite book from Colleen Hoover and I loved all the others too!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I picked up this book because I hate seeing movies that have become books without reading it first. Honestly this is not really my genre but I couldn't put it down. John Green does such a good job making you fall in love with the characters from the start. It's heartbreaking and wonderful and I highly recommend.
B00009N83Y|4|Not one of Clint's better films, but kind of fun taken for what it is. Rare to find as a DVD.

0439023513|5|Every once in a while you read a book that leaves you feeling like a better person for having read the book. I feel that way about Mockingjay.<br /><br />In the third and final book of The Hunger Games Trilogy the story centers around what happens after the Collapse of District 12 and the war that has begun in the Districts of Panem. Katniss has been rescued from the Second Hunger Games arena but Peeta was not as lucky and instead was captured by the capitol.<br /><br />Mockingjay follows the story of Katniss coming to terms with the new role of Mockinjay that has been thrust upon her, the challenges of living in a war torn world, and trying to understand her conflicting feelings for both Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />If you loved the first two Hunger Games books this is the grand Finale you've been waiting for. While I will say that I loved the story I must admit the ending was very dark and that bothered me. In Katniss's world that has been full of so much sorrow and loss I really wanted an ending I could walk away from feeling all warm and fuzzy. This ending did not offer that and even if it had it would not have been The Hunger Games series I have come to love.

B00D6BN9NK|3|It was just ok.  I kinda wished that I had the time back from watching it.  It wasn't funny and the action scenes were boring.
B00000IAU3|4|Like most, my first experience with Dido came as a result of the non-stop radio play &quot;Here With Me&quot; received.  As with many overplayed radio hits, I chalked the song and artist up as being one-hit wonders and wondered myself when I would get a break from this record.  Then fate intervened and I for some reason ended up buying No Angel.  Fate can be a good friend at times! This is truly a masterful CD.  Overall, the CD doesn't offer a lot of variety in musical disposition or attitude (it's a LOT of scorned lover music), but Dido plays her tune well.  <br />Radio overplay aside, &quot;Here With Me&quot; really is an outstanding song.  Other favorites on the CD include &quot;Don't Think of Me,&quot; &quot;All You Want,&quot; &quot;Thank You,&quot; and &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;  A jammin' CD, in my eyes, in one that can pack at least five amazing tunes--Dido does this and more.  The jewel in this CDs crown is &quot;All You Want.&quot;  The track spins a tale of a lover scorned by a cheatering man, but still trying to get him back.  However, the true beauty of the song is found when the last chorus section is broken up a bit by a change in the refrain (from &quot;All you want is right here in this room&quot; to &quot;All you want is right there in THAT room).  Okay--so I'm a sucker for well crafted lyrics, but the actual music is more than easy on the ears too.<br />Musically, I think her greatest risk, which also proved to be her biggest pay-off, is found in her final bonus track: &quot;Take My Hand.&quot;  This song is a mix of Rave, House, Chick Music, and intense feeling.  Be sure to hear this in the bars soon, and maybe even on the radio.  Overall, her sound is an amalgam of Fiona, Portishead, Sara McClaughlin, and [I hate to go here, but...] Jewel.  I cringe a bit in making comparisons, because their is something truly unique about her style.  In summation, it's more than worth a listen.  I have personally known NOBODY who has purchased this CD and been sorry about it.  I know I wasn't.
B005T87QCI|5|My 6 year old loves this! It has different levels of difficulty for all ages. Completely worth the money! He can't put the game down!

B000002JK2|5|Although more famous for rock operas, sarcastic sixties singles and smashing guitars, this fairly subdued LP is one of the more durable projects from Townshend's tumultuous career.  To begin with, it's not only Pete's triumph, for Ronnie Lane's songs are easily the equal to those of his temporary partner, and a good showcase for that understated and underrated songwriter who contributed many fine items to the catalogue of his raucous band of previous employ, The Faces.    Released in 1977, the opening year for punk in Great Britain, and doubly ironic in that it was not only a quiet album by members of two very loud bands, but a quiet album by members of two of the few 'old fart bands' still held in esteem by the punks.    In fact, this album shows again how much of the attack of even the hardest rock bands of the 1960s and 1970s was merely souped-up folk and blues music, and how much the punks missed by negating all the bluesy, funk and groove elements in rock and roll, at least until the Clash released London Calling, and Paul Weller quit The Jam to do Motown and Burt Bacharach.  \\"Street in the City,\\" \\"Misunderstood,\\" and \\"My Baby Gives It Away\\" are among the best songs Townshend would write in that entire decade, and Lane's \\"Annie\\" can stand with anything to come from the pen of those mining the vein the British retro-folk-rock uncovered in the wake of Fairport Convention's experimentation.  Both singer-songwriters shine on these inspired detours into older forms, and guests Eric Clapton (doesn't he guest on half the albums made in England during that time?), the late John Entwistle, and Charlie Watts lend their estimable talents to the project.    The mastering on this compact disc is fairly poor, however, and the cover is that of the budget reissue rather than the original from 1977.  Other albums from Townshend's back catalogue have seen better treatment than this overlooked gem; hopefully with the announced remastering project of Townshend solo albums for 2006, these oversights will be corrected, restoring dignity to this marvelous record.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Another pageturner by Grisham. A second one that I recall the character of Jake Brigance, a young, somewhat idealistic attorney that has a knack for winning cases. This is a couple of years after his first win and every bit as controversial. The characters are likeable and well developed, except for the opposing side(booo!).
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Geometry dash is a addictive game to where people want to keep playing it
B002W1UEW4|5|It was very well put together. The only thing I didn't like was cobra's costume at the end of the movie.
0783240287|5|Donny Osmond is absolutely fantastic as Joseph and  his voice has never been better!  My granddaughters so loved this DVD that I bought one for each of them for Christmas and they were thrilled with it.  It's a musical that I can watch over and over again.
B00005JKNF|3|Robert Altman must have woke up one morning and turned the tv to public television. On the tv there may have been a little show known as \\"Mystery\\" or \\"Poirot\\". As he sat there staring into the tube, enjoying the show, he probably said something like this: \\"I wanna make one of those.\\" And thus, \\"Gosford Park\\" was born.<br />Of course there were other inspirations for Gosford Park, probably an entire list of them, but it felt like a late night episode of \\"Father Cadfiel\\". Not that that's bad, but if a decent murder mystery / cast rich film can recieve awards, shouldn't we consider the lesser? Gosford Park is a good movie, a really good one. But, If you don't have interest in period films, or have problem's with quick, overlapping and sometimes unintelligable dialogue (sub-t are helpful) then don't see it. The British accent's neither help nor hinder the problem.<br />(If you have a surround sound set-up, listen out for the cigarette effect that takes place in left speaker, when the inspector first goes into the kitchen with the servants. It is a nice touch.)<br />Maggie Smith is always good in whatever she does, and transend's what could have been a drab character creating some nifty moments. You can tell she had fun with the material. The most interesting character was the Inspector, who's detatched effort's made me sit up in my seat. His performance reminded me of something Orson Welles would do if he were living today in his prime. Ryan Phillippe seemed out of place, but its good to see that he's branching out of the \\"Teen flick\\" category, and took a great step by participating. Freddy Prinze should follow his example (unfortunately he has been tackled to continue in the next two Scooby-poo sequels).<br />As a fan of period film's, I liked Gosford Park, but if I were just an everyday movie goer who had low tolerance for quick dialogue and spent my life avoiding shows like \\"Mystery\\", then you may want to miss it. ~s.a.o.s.~
B00B6QXN56|5|This is my first Joe Banamassa Cd. WOW; are they all this good? I have been meaning to check out his music for quite some time now. But when I saw that he recourded an acoustic set in the Vienna Opera House I knew he had to be someone very special so I ordered the set.  FANTASTIC CD! This man can play!  Now I have to have more of his music. Three more this week and they just keep on satisfying my love of the blues. If you want to hear the blues at their finest pick up a Joe Banamassa Cd.  You wont be disappointed I promis.
B00AREIAI8|5|game fun for both me and my 5 year old we work together to keep our horses happy. it is a great game. we love it<br />graphics are very good
B0002Y4TM4|5|I've been a captivated Marillion fan since I heard 'Seasons End' all those years ago. For me they've never made a less than brilliant album in their long career, including pre Hogarth albums. In short, I agree with everything manuel Hernandez wrote in the previous review about this album but would like to add that if you are enthralled by this album as I am, you need to get the 'MARBLES ON THE ROAD' DVD as well. The live performance from Steve Hogarth adds a depth of emotion, drama and humour that you can't get from the CD alone.
B00OKYQZDI|4|Fun
B00DHQHAH0|5|This is one of the best shows on TV these days. Definitely recommend to others as I loved this show.
B00HV2KPNW|3|My daughter loves it and it reminds me more of the older Disney movies, which I like...in my opinion, Disney movies as of the last decade have become a bit formulaic, this was a good departure. Nice story, good execution and very memorable songs for the girls.
B00000GAIW|5|If I had only 10 rock CDs in my collection, this would be one of them. <br /> <br />Most people are familiar with \\"Locomotive Breath\\" - a excellent cut on this CD - and if that song strikes your fancy, then you'll love this CD. <br /> <br />Musically,  the songs are masterpieces with lyrics that explore topics rarely discussed in modern music.  This CD sounds as refreshing, current, and contagious as it did when it was released about 30 years back. <br /> <br />The world would be a poorer place had this CD never been created.
B00SXK8R6S|5|Beautiful filming. Wonderful story. Jamie Fraser is a namesake.
B009UX2YAC|5|Awesome game! I would recommend this game
B000BOH8XW|4|I never liked Shakira a whole lot. I found her annoying and cheesy. When, Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 came out, i found \\"La Tortura\\" annoying too and i dismissed her again. But then, I heard \\"Don't Bother\\" from Oral Fixation Vol. 2. I fell in love with it. After my love for \\"Don't Bother\\" I decided to download a couple other songs from the CD on Limewire to see if it was worth buying. I tried \\"Animal City\\", \\"Timor\\", and \\"How Do You Do\\" and loved them all. Finally, I bought the CD. I won't lie. I was somewhat dissapointed with the other songs besides the ones I'd already heard. But overtime i ended up liking almost all the songs and it's still a very good effort.    1) How Do You Do 10/10 very weird beginning, but great start  2) Don't Bother 10/10 love the lyrics and is very catchy.  3) Illegal 9/10 a little slow, but still worth some listens  4) The Day And Time 10/10 grew on me, now i love it  5) Animal City 10/10 awesome lyrics, one of my faves, catchy  6) Dreams For Plans 10/10 took a while, but now i love it  7) Hey You 10/10 love the beginning a LOT. good verse & chorus.  8) Your Embrace 7.5/10 nice lyrics, but easy to forget   9) Costume Makes The Clown 7/10 my least favorite, hate the lyrics  10)Something 10/10 so nice and simple. love love love the chorus  11)Timor 10/10 one of my faves, great lyrics, amazing overall    shown in a few songs, Oral Fixation vol. 2 has some weak spots, but the best songs hold it all together.
B001DLWEYK|4|Saucy!  It has some hints of the first movie woven throughout....at first it seems a little cheezy, but give it 20 mins and you will be totally into this film.  The lead actor has some moves!  Worth the watch....total chic flick!  I would watch again.
B006BGZJJ4|5|After not using my Kindle for some time, I found that the cord sheath was crumbling when I did finally take it out to use.  A call to Amazon, Kindle customer service, resulted in the cord being replaced as No Charge.  This cord is much better material and works fine.  Fast service.
B000099T2L|5|Its Beyonce so what else needs to be said? That girl will get you moving.  I put this album on when in the kitchen fixing dinner or cleaning up afterwards and the lively beats make the time spent speed by. If you're a Beyonce fan, this is a nice CD to add to your collection.
B00E3UN44W|5|This was a present for my sister, who lives at Reston VA.  The logistics of getting something like this to her in time for her birthday don't bear thinking about  -  good job, Amazon!
B007XKEY6Q|3|This game has the potential to be extremely amusing, that is, as long the person you are playing actually wants to play the game...Sometimes when people don't know what to do, instead of sucking it up and taking a point loss for not being able to effectively draw the item they selected they simply write out the word then send it to you for you to solve....Not sure who is the bigger jerk on that one, them for taking the cheaters way out or you for sticking it to them and refusing to enter the correct answer or refusing to solve. This game is definitely better on larger devices like Kindles and those mammoth smart phones, preferably the ones that come with stylus'. I haven't tried playing on my iphone yet, but something tells me it's like asking for eye-strain so I haven't tried. Three stars because some people are point mongers and don't want to lose.
B002N2LEVM|5|awesome.rate 5, glued to my seat. constant change, related to real life with gov't and people. #illuminati #gov't sucks #american beliefs
B00F3WO0NS|5|Inlove
B00BEIYMTW|3|Not as good as the car series but young kids still liked it.
B00000JH09|5|This is simply one of the best hardcore albums ever. This group got me interested in the whole hard rock scene. Ever since i picked this album up 2 years ago, i couldn't get enough of them. The guitars on this album are great and the vocals are also equally excellent. Every song on here is awesome especially &quot;Sugar&quot;(a personal favorite), &quot;War?&quot;, and &quot;Spiders&quot;. All in all this album is one of the best.
1580176941|5|I bake sugar cookies as a hobby, on many holidays & occasions. I've recently been asked to bake cookies as party favors & things. I am in no way shape or form a professional, but it is indeed something I'm passionate about. The recipe I use is right from this book. Though the book only contains four recipes, they are all equally delicious! The book is mostly baking & decorating tips, all of which I've found incredibly useful. I get amazing reviews on my cookies every time!<br /><br />The only tip I can suggest to you is not about the book itself, but your baking procedure. If you're making rolled sugar cookies with cookie cutters, I use about a half a cup to a cup less of flour than the recipe calls for (depending on if I'm doubling or even tripling the recipe). If you're like me, when you roll the cookies, you use TONS of flour. If you cut some out of the recipe, it doesn't take away from the cookies when you add more flour when rolling. The dough also doesn't get as flaky as quickly by doing this.<br /><br />Happy baking! :)
B00A66A3XW|2|First season of Revenge was just spectacular! It kept me wanting more and always ended each episode with a semi-believable twist so that I couldn't wait to power through the next episode. In that way it reminded me of the first season of Prison Break where you just can't stop watching. Emily was fueled by such a sense of wanting revenge and trying to meet her plans all while feeling emotions for those people that could end up casualties. Season two does not have the fierceness of season one. In fact, it just feels like a soap opera badly acted. I had been telling my husband to watch this show for months now and he came in while I was watching an episode of season two and he actually laughed out loud. He said it looked terrible and I had to admit, with pregnant Amanda falling off the staircase at Grayson manner and all the other ridiculous plot twists in that episode, it was every bit as farfetched and cheesy as the old 90's Melrose Place episodes. I am going to give it a few more episodes but I may just check out of this season if it doesn't redeem itself. I still love Emily and I am still rooting for Jack who is the only believable character at this point. However, Nolan and Victory's acting is over-the-top this season and don't even get me started on Aiden. I am just hoping that it picks ups soon.
B009HV2JT8|2|It starts out entertaining but quickly becomes quite boring. Needs more vampires and less politics. More action would have made a much better movie.
