6305263248|5.0|So what if the plot is a bit thin!  If you appreciate a good car chase, this is it!  Right up alongside Bullitt and Gone in 60 Seconds.  Put your brain in neutral and your excitement potential in overdrive and enjoy.   Don't forget the popcorn and a liquid....
B000001FS3|5.0|From the moment this album was released, most listeners wondered if the Irish band would abandon themselves in the commercial sound of the late 80's.  However, by walking a narrow line between the open sound of  &quot;arena rock&quot; in songs like &quot;Where the Streets Have No  Name&quot; and &quot;In God's Country&quot; and the quiet, poignant sounds  of &quot;With or Without You&quot; and &quot;Running To Stand Still&quot;   the group created one of the greatest testaments to the influences of  American music while remembering their Celtic background.  The real  treasure of this album is in the fact that no matter how many times you  hear this sweeping and stirring album, you find something new-a different  way of feeling the music. The work as a whole even holds up in the later  stages of the album, in little played but magnificent songs such as  &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;.  A poetic  work in lyrics and in music. This album will stand as a monument for bands  looking to combine the physical and spiritual for years to come.
0440234743|4.0|Ive been waiting for the paperback of Grisham's The Testament for quite some time.  Adding to this suspense was the plot of the story which was well written.  Whats disappointing was the ending of the book.  As if  Rachel just passed away like that without being reunited with the real  world.  I was hoping for a reunion of sorts that will change Nate for  good... but Grisham's not cheesy enough to do that!  Great book thou did  not meet my expectations to be rated 5 star...a 4 star will do!
B00001OH1S|4.0|As everyone else has said this CD is too short.  But not only that, the score's tracks (5-12) are too short too.  The bright, uplifting and confident music by Bill Conti is featured in glimpsingly short tracks.  You  don't want it to finish!  You want it to go on.  Even track 8, which is a  lovely jazzy track, is short by jazz standards.  Its theme could have been  developed for five minutes more!  What a treat that would have been.<br />This  is the reason why I gave the CD 4 stars.<br />(Can anyone recommend Bill Conti  CDs, by the way?)
0515127485|3.0|A lively thriller that I found I couldn't put down. Not great literature but well-written and well-constructed enough to keep you reading long after bed-time. Very well-researched too with everything smacking of realism.
B00001QGPS|5.0|YO, IT'S ASSASSIN FROM DEATHSQUAD AND &quot;BLACKOUT!&quot; WAS THE BEST RAP ALBUM IN 1999. I PLAYED THIS CD SO MANY TIMES AND IT HASN'T GROWN OLD YET. THE PRODUCTION IS HOT TO DEF AND THE LYRICS ARE VERY SHARP AND OFTEN  HILARIOUS. THE BEST TRACKS ARE &quot;BLACKOUT!&quot;, &quot;Y.O.U.&quot;,  &quot;TEAR IT OFF&quot;, &quot;DA ROCKWILDER&quot;, &quot;MAAD CREW&quot;,  AND THE BEST METHOD MAN  RED MAN TRACK EVER, &quot;FIRE INNA HOLE&quot;. OH  MAN, ONLY CUSS WORDS CAN DESCRIBE HOW INCREDIBLE THIS ALBUM IS.
6303212263|5.0|From the comic book stands of the pre-war 1930s and 40s, to the big screen of the post-watergate 1970s, the Man of Steel does it again.    Superman sours over the City of Metropolis and defeats the evil plans of Lex Luthor.  And along the way captures the heart of America all over again in this  cinematic display of special effects, action, and an excellent performace  by Christopher Reeve. To the young who haven't seen this movie-see it.  Those those of us who saw at the theater-see it again, and watch the Last  Son of Krypton be, not just a hero, but what he said he was in the  Movie...&quot;A Friend&quot;
B00002MZ2C|4.0|YO, IT'S ASSASSIN FROM DEATHSQUAD AND IN A COUNTRY WHERE MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE IGNORANCES AND INTELLIGENCE OF DONKEY KONG, RATM COMES TO AWAKEN AND EXPAND THE MINDS OF YOUTHS WHO USUALLY WOULD LISTEN TO &quot;COWBOY&quot;,  WATCH ECW, AND PLAY NASCAR ON THEIR PLAYSTATIONS THAN DO SOMETHING WITH  THEIR MINDS. FROM &quot;TESTIFY&quot; TO &quot;BORN AS GHOSTS&quot; RATM  LITES THE FIRE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DECIEVED BY THE ILLUSIONS OF THE  GOVERNMENT. I REALLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM, AND WHEN YOU PLAY IT ON  YOUR STEREO, INSTEAD OF BOBBIN YA HEAD, TAKE OUT SOME TIME TO LISTEN TO THE  LYRICS OF ZACH DE LA ROCHA,YOU JUST MIGHT GAIN SOMETHING.
068484267X|5.0|I am the daughter of an Irish-American who was born in the U.S. during the mid-twenties.  Admittedly, I read this book because it was a best-seller, but after reading just the first paragraph, I knew I had to read it.  Not  only did this book give me some insight into the reality of poverty (from  which I've been spared, thank God), but it gave me a great understanding of  my father.  I brought up and read various passages from the book to my  father and he couldn't have agreed more whole-heartedly. Besides enjoying  the biography itself, I enjoyed Mr. McCourt's writing style.  I've never  come across such a way of writing; it was quite intriguing. I disagree with  the 3-star reviewer about the lack of thought on McCourt's part as a  teenager.  When a person grows up in a certain milieu, why should one  question it?  As was stated in the book, one just didn't ask questions of  ANYONE that wasn't a peer.  Nowadays, we offer greater diversity in schools  and a chance for questions by all students, so we see the disparity very  clearly, almost painfully.  I haven't read 'Tis yet, but I am sure Mr.  McCourt will be sharing his thoughts one life and how it can be different.
6305171769|4.0|I found this movie to be more of a novelty item to the original's greatness. I think Steve Miner could have used more gore (i.e. F-13 2 &amp; 3) and maybe they should have changed the plot to have Myers on his old  stomping grounds. Anyway, it was pretty cool, LL Cool J as fun laughing at,  but why didn't Michael choke his annoying a@@ like he did to the guy in  Part I? Maybe then I would give this five stars. H20 just makes the  original look even better.
6300268470|4.0|John Wayne was offered the starring role in &quot;High Noon&quot; before Gary Cooper and turned it down flat. He disliked the script because he thought it was &quot;unAmerican.&quot; A sheriff in his time of need is abandoned by everyone? The Duke hated it.<br />&quot;Rio Bravo&quot; is the Duke's version of &quot;High Noon.&quot; Here the sheriff, played by a terrific Dean Martin, gets help from every direction- the Duke, the codger- Walter Brennan, and the kid- Ricky Nelson. In &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; people stick together for what is right. It's John Wayne's version of America.

0393965953|5.0|This book is not for everyone (as the next two reviews clearly demonstrate).  I first read Vanity Fair in junior high, and at the time I probably would have agreed with the comments of the next two reviews:  Vanity Fair seemed slow and plodding, confusing and contradictory.  When I  recently reread Vanity Fair, I could scarcely believe that this brilliant,  ironic, hilarious, and incisive romp was the same book as the dull tome I  had remembered.  In retrospect I realized why my perspective had changed:  in junior high I had read the book superficially and found the plot and  characters lacking enough excitement to hold my interest; now I realized  that the most captivating action was taking place outside the plot in the  interaction between the reader and the most important person in the novel:  the narrator.  I, like many readers, completely missed this deeper level of  meaning the first time around.  Thus, to recommend this novel to the  unsophiscated, inexperienced reader (such as I had been) would be futile.   It takes a keen sense of irony and certain degree of insight into the  workings of life and literature to recognize the narrator's vital role and  to appreciate this novel in its fullest sense.  This book is not an easy  read: it forces the reader to confront many difficult moral questions and  provides no easy answers.  But for those who can handle ambiguity and can  detect subtle, yet &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny humor Vanity Fair is  not only a necessary read, but an enjoyable one.<br />(Note: Buy this edition  of Vanity Fair.  The illustrations which Thackery drew for this novel  greatly enhance the text, and the Norton edition reproduces all of them.   In addition, the criticisms which are included make for a thought-provoking  read and may help clarify your opinion of the novel).
B000002LRX|5.0|I've been a Faith No More fan for almost a year now and they are definetaly one of the top ten on my list.  This album, in my opinion, is one of the greatest albums of all time.  Seriously!  A lot of people would  have to agree with me.  'Angel Dust' is one of the most addictive albums  I've listened to along with Black Sabbath - 'Master of Reality' and Ozzy  Osbourne - 'No More Tears'.  There are various emotions in 'Angel Dust'  like anger, happiness, sadness, and at some points, fear.  Any fan of metal  must have Faith No More 'Angel Dust' in their collection.  It's too bad the  band is broken up.
6301796535|3.0|I've seen better movies before (like Planet of the Apes, for example) but this movie was pretty interesting. The movie has a great cast with strong characters. My personal favorite is Francine, Vivian's (Julia Roberts)  street smart older sister whose dream in life is to be a ballerina. The  musical numbers from the film are great, particularly the duet between Kit  and Vivian.
B00000JMOF|5.0|This presentation of the classic James Whale 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is the most perfect representation of this fine film, even beating out the nearly perfect laser disk presentation of  several years back.  The documentary on the making of Frankenstein by David  Skal, master horror historian, is worth the price of the DVD alone.  Not  only is the movie represented with crystal clarity, but the art gallery and  commentary add to this great product.  A must have for film fans and  monster buffs.
B000031WD9|4.0|The movie is only funny using the original dialogues, the German translation is horrible
B00000J5Z6|5.0|Sublime!  If there is anyone who wants to hear creditable interpretations of Bob's music, then this is the cd to buy. The piano sweetly plays Bob's melodies as the musicians effortlessly switch between reggae and jazz; and  the reggae sections will give you a very close feel to what the originals  are like. Monty's choice of songs is also good (let's face it there are are  a lot of songs to choose from) -  from songs that first brought Bob to  international prominence(No Woman No Cry, Natty Dread) to later  favourites(Jamming, Could You Be Loved), and to include my all time fave  Crisis is just unerring. Forget other tributes that are on offer - this is  the best!
0380796090|5.0|I could not put this fun book down! It really made me laugh and I loved the story. Good Read!
B000002JNN|3.0|This is the typical ACDC of the '90's, not too bad, but not very good either.  This CD to be fair probably deserves 2.5 stars - it's that mediocre.  The band just cannot live up to Back in Black and Highway to  Hell. Kinda boring really, with dumb lyrics, but boring ACDC is better than  most of the garbage out there nowadays.  Buy it on sale, and don't expect  anything too great.
0064407667|5.0|Once I was reading The Bad Beginning on the bus and my friend read one page of it and loved it. Then another friend read a page and loved it now there fighting over who gets to read it. It's very unexpected and very adventurous. It keeps me up at night wondering what's going to happen next  it was so exciting! I think it's just as good as Harry Potter if not  better!  It's very adventurous and dareing it's one of the best books I've  ever read!
0671027344|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got confused.  Truly this book should be required reading for everyone who has attended highschool or will be attending.  Everyone will relate to one or more experiences that Charlie  has in this story, if it be the untimely passing of a friend, a clueless  parent, or just plain old teenaged drugs, sex, and rock and roll, you will  love this book.  If you loved &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; you will love this  book.  If you loved the &quot;Chicken Soup For The Soul&quot; series, you  will love this book.
0767802659|5.0|This movie is one the best movies I've ever seen with aliens being the main topic! The visual effects of this movie are unbelievable! They are so clear and colorful on DVD! This movie should of one the 1997 Academy Award  for best visual effects! This movie is full of action, a little bit of  drama, and has the imagination of what the future holds for Earth!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I found Dido's &quot;No Angel&quot; to be a great album, not because she is like every other signing female out there, but because she throws a lot of emotion into her music (unlike Natalie Merchant's dreary  &quot;singing&quot;). A must for those who want a female with the voice and  the emotional punch
0312199066|2.0|I bought this book after viewing the segment in HBO's series regarding the U.S's race to the moon featuring Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt.  Their segment regarding the final voyage to the moon was lively and enlightening.   I thought the book would feature that mission.  WRONG.<br />The book had its  interesting insights, but was far less riveting than Michael Collins' or  Jim Lovell's books on similar subject matter.  Cernan focuses far too much  on himself (from birth through present day) and takes some potshots at  colleagues that seem less illustrative than they are mean-spirited and  self-serving.<br />The mission of Apollo 17 is almost an afterthought in this  book.  How disappointing; if the book had probed the fascinatingly  successful mission in-depth and brought the differences between Cernan, the  astronaut and Schmitt, the scientist, to light in as positive and engaging  a manner as was demonstrated in the HBO special, this could have been a  winner.<br />It's not even close.  Don't bother with this one.
630463949X|3.0|Did monkeys play with the post audio production on the DVD
0789423952|4.0|I consider this book a &quot;must have&quot;. It is compact (travels well) and is very well illustrated. The instructions are very easy to follow. Anyone who camps, hikes or sails should have a copy. Makes a great gift (e.g. Christmas stocking stuffer).
B00003CXAQ|5.0|A marvelous film,  filled with adrenaline inducing action sequences and great performances make this the best of the three Indiana Jones films. (we'll see how the 4th one measures up in about 7 years)<br />    The story,  pitting Indy against a cult in India, is not as violent or racsist as many  say it is.  It is a backdrop, against which Speilberg and Lucas display  their collective genius.  Harrison Ford depicts Indy the best in this  installment and Kate Capshaw offers a funny, yet ultimately strong heroine.   The score by John Williams is the best of HIS carreer.               There  are of course debits, such as the out of place feeling when viewed allong  with the other two films.  The special effects are not up to par for ILM,  and the addition of Indy's sidekick, Shortround, is cheap (considering he  is not seen in any of the other films).<br />       All in all though, it is  the best of this fabulous series and entertains me after countless  viewings.
B000001K2V|5.0|There are a number of sets of the Mozart sonatas which are so fine as to be considered &quot;classics&quot; in their own right; Uchida's lovely version on Philips being one that springs to mind; there are a few others  of equal stature.  But none surpasses and very few ever come near to  equalling this exquisite set.  Walter Klien is not as well known as Brendel  or Kovacevich or their peers but his realization of Mozart's sonatas is, in  a word, perfection.  And this second volume is every bit the equal of the  first.  From the haunting loveliness and uncluttered simplicity of the  Andante grazioso of the A Major Sonata, K. 331, to its justly famous (and  really fun!) &quot;Alla Turca&quot; rondo finale, and all the other  wonderful pieces that follow, listening to this recording is a blissful and  humanizing experience-- it's music that sinks deep into one's soul, that  feeds it, and which becomes only more wonderful with repeated listening.   Klien's playing is flawless:  perfectly modulated, embracing sentiment  without a trace of sentimentality, able to be pretty without preciosity;  and the Vox recording is splendid, the piano tone rich, with perfect  balance between deep bass and bright, clean treble.  And the  piece-de-resistance is that it comes at the very lowest price:  you can buy  both volumes for less than a single volume of the other sets and get what  is arguably the finest recording in the bargain -- with change left over!  An essential part of every music lover's collection, and one that will  bring hours of unalloyed fulfilment.  The Penguin Guide awarded the Klien  set a Rosette (its &quot;academy award&quot;) and I heartily agree!
B000002GVZ|5.0|Carly Simon is an outstanding performer.  The music on this CD is well worth owning.  I bought it as a gift for my wife and she also loves it.  We are both into music from the 60s and 70s so this CD was right up our alley.   A must have for all the baby boomers out there.
0060977493|1.0|I found this book to be of no redeeming literary value what-so-ever.  No plot existed, the characters were lifeless. Also the literary style does not lend itself to a full length novel, only at best a short story.  This  book stirred no feelings of interest anywhere in me.
B000000W5N|5.0|This album has the full range of the music that made the Stones the world's greatest rock band.  Brown Sugar is the classic, but Can't You Hear Me Knocking ties with Satisfaction and the live version of Midnight Rambler  as the Stones' best song.  This hard rocking song starts out with Richards'  wailing, snarling guitars, but smoothly transforms into one of the finest  jazz pieces ever recorded for its second three minutes.  This album  combines rock, blues, country and soul and does it right.
B000005JAX|5.0|Martin Gore is an artistic god. This is one of the best excerpts of music that my ears have had the fortune to enjoy. The album is haunting and beautiful throughout; the cold black waters of the river Styx roil in one  track (spare instrumentation blended in such a way that the sound  complements and contrasts--raw and alive! The music writhes!) and in the  next Martin's voice soars like a bird of light. The content is very  diverse.<br />This album is Martin Gore. You must know Depeche Mode if you  have arrived at Counterfeit, and if DM's music reaches deep inside of you,  then I am confident this will too, b/c in both musics shine the soul of  Martin Gore. Gore's interpretations of his favorite songs are so brilliant  that I was shocked (and initially disappointed) that he did not write them  himself. On second thought however, I realized that he did. There were  basic tunes pre-set, but the songs on Counterfeit are Martin's!<br />If you  like Gore's voice, which I think is one of the most fabulous voices  (unmatched in sinuous power), you may become addicted to this 25 minute  exposition of musical perfection.<br />The only fault in the album is its  brevity!
B00000JCB2|1.0|Nothing new to be learned here, except how to use the F-Word in new and exciting ways.  Limp Bizkit uses profanity artfully, and without merit.  Intellectually speaking, were at ground zero here.  What message are they are trying to get across?  &quot;Break Stuff&quot; insited riots at  Woodstock.  Great music guys, it's really inspiring.  You have to ask  yourself, what is the end result here?  What can you get accomplished by  listening to Limp Bizkit?  I'm assuming it's great music to do drugs to.   So you can just tune out and hate EVERYTHING, YEEAH!  Let's go out and  Break Stuff!  There is no redemption in this music.  And i'm not saying go  out and listen to Christian music either.  There is sooo much other music  out there that is artfully constructed, brilliantly written, poetic,  romantic, inspiring, sophisticated and timeless.  Limp Bizkit's  &quot;Significant Other&quot; or any of their other garbage (which i'm  assuming is nothing more than a replicant of this) is none of the above  mentioned.  This music is not a derivitive of  the punk movement either.  The early eighties were a different time and the  social climate was abhorently different than now.  They had a genuine  feeling behind their music.  That was real angst.
B000002H4Q|5.0|I will be simple.<br />Kiss Me is a superb work of art. It is incredibly rich, lush, deep, raw, refined, heavy, ethereal, divine, and animal.<br />It is the Cure's most diverse album, and along w/ Disintegration is probably  their best (but WISH and Faith are ground-breaking, incredible too).<br />This  is an awesome record--over 70 mins in length--from one of history's  greatest bands. It is edible again and again and can satisfy any mood such  is the range of emotional exploration.<br />If you want to begin constructing  a quality music library, then buy the following albums from my two favorite  bands: Black Celebration, 101, Violator (Depeche Mode); and of course,  Disintegration, Wish, and Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me (The Cure).  Fabulous.<br />Why are there so few pioneers, bands of true uniqueness and  quality, in today's popular music? I'll tell you: b/c of pure f'n  commercialism! Corporate fabricated bands are aired on corporate media  outlets to a corporatized society. Life stinks eh? My redolent garden, my  retreat, is in the music of bands like the Cure, DM, OMD, and 2 music  goddesses, Loreena McKennitt and Enya....
0156528207|4.0|After reading &quot;The Little Prince&quot;, I was reminded of how all adults must never lose sight of their inner child.  It is a story about a pilot who is stranded in the desert and encounters the Little Prince.  This Little Prince teaches the adult about the meaning of life, and gives the  reader a youthful perspective on life.  This heart warming story of  friendship touched me, and it made me evaluate what is important to me.  I  recommend this novel to anyone searching for clarity in his hectic life.
0684872153|5.0|Deciding that I wanted to read this book before seeing the movie, I'm so glad I did.  I couldn't put this book down.  It's so unbelievably depressing and sad, yet you will find yourself laughing as you read what  Frank is thinking as a young boy living life in proverty.  It's amazing to  me to think of how these drunk fathers could watch their children starve to  death, simply because they couldn't resist the drink.  This book is a real  triumph, and left me with that sense of hope, that if Frank McCourt could  get through that, you can get through anything.
0553328255|5.0|Of course it's good, it's Sherlock Holmes. This edition of the stories is particularly nice because it's not a cumbersome hardback behemoth of a book. It's portable.  Sherlock Holmes is the greatest detective of all time. The stories are fast-paced, interesting, and at times humorous. Like  any other collection of stories it's got a couple ones that aren't as good  as the others, but in such a large collection, it's easy to overlook those.  Holmes is an extremely fascinating character, and you will never tire of  reading about him. Doyle's writing is no where near as boring as other  Victorian writers.   Forget all those goofy Basil Rathbone films and  charicatures of a man in an ulster and deerstalker. This is the real thing.
B00003CX95|5.0|BraveHeart was amazing, awesome, inspirational, and all the other words that can describe this wonderful and powerful movie. It has love, drama, action, comedy and sex all together in one great adventure filled true  story about William Wallace. To miss this, would be a big mistake.
B000002U84|5.0|Duran Duran's \\"Rio\\" is unequivocally the perfect pop album, perhaps the band's best effort ever. It's largely defined by its atmospheric keyboard sound, which provides an aura of mysteriousness and sometimes foreboding. As was typical with pop music from its era, \\"Rio\\" contains pristine '80s  production and mixing by producer Colin Thurston, but it's important to note that every song here is a potential hit, radio-friendly to the max, with lyrics that go from lightweight to soul searching. Often, Simon LeBon portrays himself in an almost sympathetically light, despite his outward vanity. He has a way of getting down about himself, acting tired and pleading, while his voice ranges from low and droning to piercingly high-pitched. LeBon is a good singer, but when his voice is double-tracked on some tunes the results are positively awesome. Lyrically, \\"Rio\\" is more astute and mature than one might expect from five English pretty boys plastered all over MTV and in their 20s. There's defiance (\\"My Own Way,\\" \\"Hold Back the Rain\\"), romance (\\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\"), a questioning of personal faith (\\"New Religion\\") and elegance and gloomy mysteriousness (\\"The Chauffer\\").<br /><br />Oh, and we can't forget about the mega hits like \\"Rio\\" and \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" both of which still get played on modern-rock radio stations across the country today. Overall, this album is splattered with big, arena-ready choruses, ambient and mysterious synth sounds by Nick Rhodes, chunky bass lines by rocker-at-heart John Taylor, and precision percussion throughout.<br /><br />The one-night-stand love song is surprisingly tender (\\"Save a Prayer\\"), while other songs are filled with bravado and gusto, sounding distressed in the the grand choruses. Most interesting is the dark and foreboding \\"The Chauffer,\\" which demonstrates Duran Duran's tendancy to go from heroic to tragic from song to song, always remaing ready for big-time radio airplay. No one should miss this early-'80s classic.
0767802470|5.0|This is a great film and the remastering is the best I have seen so far. This movie was based upon actual events and that makes the film even more breathtaking. The Dolby Digital (5.1) English format is dubbed but this is  not distracting when watching it. If you love great war movies, you're  missing out if you don't give this one a chance!
6301871952|5.0|OK, for all you poeple who think this movie was supposed to be scarry, well it wasn't. The 1st one wasn't even scarry(they started singing Snow White in the movie teather, and you call that scarry). This movie was great  and one of my favs. if you havent already saw this, see it.
B00003XB8K|3.0|In my opinion...any albums after the first will never compare...on every album released after the first...there has only been one or two good singles worth listening to...the rest of the tracks dragged on...as for the  their newest.. track 3 w/ the girl from the group Olive doin vocals  definately delivers...as well as the beats hittin in track two...if u  notice...they use snippets from the first album in the background  throughout this one....sorry guys...u left me hangin wanting a lil bit more  than u delivered....
0312965788|5.0|Most people will read this book and be engrossed by the wonderful characters and happenings in its pages.  However, it should not be overlooked that James Herriott is one of the best storytellers ever to take up a pen.<br />If one looks closely at the progression of the narrative in  each story, the simple-yet-satisfying dialogue and the very rich prose that  is amazingly easy to digest it's clear that James Herriott has a  distinctive literary style that appeals to the senses and the mind as well  as the heart.
B000002UAU|2.0|I love the Beatles.  I'll start with that.  And for years, I would mindlessly agree with those who said that &quot;Pepper&quot; was their greatest record, without really giving it much thought.  But in recent  years, I've noticed that while I've had most of the Beatles catalog for  about 10 years now, Sgt. Pepper is without a doubt the one I listen to the  least.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I listened to it at all.  I  just never seem to want to hear those songs.  Most of them sound boring and  dated, and many suffer from being so catchy, that after enough exposure,  you just get plain sick of it.  It just sounds like one big experiment that  didn't really work.  I read a review here saying that one of the reasons  it's so great is because it was the first album to print song titles on the  sleeve.  So what!   Maybe I'll put out the first album ever to be dubbed  and mixed entirely by a family of monkeys.  Will that make it great?   The  songs just aren't there.  I find myself going back consistently to the  White Album, Revolver, Rubber Soul, Abbey Road, and even Let it Be.  The  Beatles were at their best when they were just simply trying to make music,  not trying to out-do some other band or make some grandiose statement and  change everything as we know it.

6303430570|5.0|Word of mouth &amp; personal expierience made me want to see this movie.And when I did,it left an indelible mark.Grant,Clerks will have you rolling from beginning to end(such   phrases as Chewlies  Gum,37,____mopper,Berzerker,shoe polish,&amp; salsa shark bring to mind  this film),but it's a look at Gen X 20-somethings in the 90's.The bad  job,the stagnation,&amp; the indecisiveness of life at that age.Brian  O'Halloran plays Dante Hicks,the convienience store jocky with all the  whiny&quot;I HATE MY LIFE BUT DON&quot;T WANT TO CHANGE IT&quot;attitude I  hear among Gen-Xer's.But Jeff Anderson plays Randell Graves ,the video  store clerk and the ultimate slacker.He hates his job,not his  life.Disregard his responsibility to his job 'cos he knows it's a dead end  and there is something better.After a day when Dante is conned and  complaining about working on his day off(as well as other bizarre  circumstances)Randell sets Dante straight telling him that he overdramatise  things to make his life seem more interesting than what it is.Kevin Smith  is a genius.Even though his movies fall on the wayside  sometimes(Mallrats,Dogma),his skewed vision has brought him a  following.Legend has it that he sold his comic book collection to finance  Clerks.It shows he sacrificed something he loved for something his fans  will embrace &amp; love for many moons to come
B000001Y42|1.0|I despised this album. It's absolutely horrible. The misogynist garbage that spews from Fred Durst's mouth is insulting,pointless,and just plain stupid. I would compare his song writing &quot;skills&quot; to those of a  cranky ten year old who thinks he's all grown up.The music,if you can call  it that, is just boring,annoying noise. If their &quot;music&quot; is so  great then my father's bodily noises could easily win a Grammy.
0783229100|5.0|If you like to feel like you just beat the system, you'll love The Sting.  The combination of swanky style, ragtime, and oneupsmanship makes this movie one the all time great comedy/dramas.
0517122707|5.0|If you love intelligent humor that holds something new at each reading then you MUST NOT PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY. Quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read. Brimming with oddball characters of every  description and scenarios beyond belief this book is the Mona Lisa of  humorous literature. Uproarously hilarious! The tragedy is that Mr. Toole's  literary career was cut short by his untimely death.
B000003N89|5.0|This CD is outstanding. Paul Keller on bass is without a doubt the best bassist around today!  It is money well spent if you buy this CD.  Diana shines brightly with her fantasic singing and piano playing. I highly  recommend his CD to anyone.
B000002BBY|5.0|The best music form the uk is definately oasis.  they just cant be beat!  Good lyrics, good music, good musicians, and all-around the best rock and roll that is out lately.  The album Whats the story(Morning glory) is a  must have for anyone who is a music fan!
B000002HJR|5.0|one of my favorite albums.  Almost every song is good.  Not as heavy as pantera (or as noisy) but still good.  If you like this you may also like Corrosion of Conformity.  I'm amazed this album isn't more well-known.
B000002KHF|5.0|Does ANYONE know why this classic, and Astral Weeks, maybe Morrison best works, have not gotten the remastering treatment? <br />How frustrating!
B000002GGO|5.0|I have a decent chunk of Simple Minds Cd's,and this one floored me like no other. Similarly produced and sounding as U2's Unforgettable Fire,except more intense. Some absolute classic songs like &quot;Speed Your Love To  Me&quot; (my fav Simple Minds tune now),&quot;Book of Brilliant  Things&quot;,&quot;Up On the Catwalk&quot; and &quot;C Moon Cry Like a  Baby&quot;. The only so so song is &quot;White Hot Day&quot;.BUY THIS!
0679746048|5.0|I first heard about this book a year ago, when a friend told me to read it. I had been deeply depressed for some time, and this book just saved my life. It really spoke to me. Susanna seemed to be feeling everything I was and I came out with a deeper understanding of my illness. The movie was so  faithful to the book, and I have to thank Winona Ryder for that. This book  was so incredible, I read it straight through in about 2 hours. You must  read it!
014130541X|5.0|A great story about Frankenstein!<br />I found it very interesting and easy to understand. It kept my interest and I felt compassion for Frankenstein.  He did not asked to be created by Victor, but Victor wanted to come up with  a new creation to man-kind.  Then after Victor created this monster, he  finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. &quot;That is what got me  hooked&quot;  Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and  the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked.  This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat  something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could  seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as  your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even  Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness.  Thank you. Joe Reaves.
B000002U9Y|5.0|I consider this to be a first, (in a sense) for PF, because it's the first time they weren't artistically dominated by Syd.  Roger Waters steps in and absolutely shines with his eerily haunting &quot;Set the Controls&quot; and  &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot;.  Wright contributes as well with the  pleasant &quot;Remember A Day&quot; and &quot;Seesaw&quot;, but it was  clear from the outset that Waters was going to mold the band in his image.   I believe it is essential to listen to pre &quot;Dark Side&quot; PF to  fully appreciate the growth of this amazing band.
B00001QGPS|4.0|This is one hell of an album. There are a lot of good songs but the cd is very unbalanced. A few songs are straight skip throughs but &quot;Da Rockwilder&quot; has the best beat of any sond in the world!  The lyrics  just blow your mind and you cant help but rap along.
B00000JZIK|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. First the plots never stops twisting and turning. At the end it takes some time for you to figure it all out. Those are the kinds of movies that should be  issued to crummy no talent writers. And it has one of the best lines in it.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is one hell of an album. Of the 19 songs (in/outros dont count niether do intermissions) 16 are head bobing good. The best are 3,4,6,10,11,13,19 and 22
B000002UWL|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys are at their best on Behavior, which ranks as not only their best album, but I would argue one of the best albums ever.  From the incredible &quot;Being Boring&quot; to the truth of &quot;End of the  World&quot;, Neil and Chris write and sing about love and opportunities  lost. They have never been better. While their other albums have some great  moments on them, no other album is so complete. Even after listening to it  for almost 10 years now, the songs and feelings they evoke feel as new as  the day I first bought it.  Incredible.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I'ved just purchased the DVD of this movie even it is the NTSC version, I loved the improved &quot;Dolby Digital 5.1&quot; soundtrack. I am wondering why everyone is &quot;oohing &amp; ahhing&quot; about the Special Edition  as if it was just released. It has been available on VHS here in Australia  since the cinema release of Alien 3 (about 1993). Classic movie, is my  favourite with Starship Troopers.
1573226521|1.0|I had heard good things about &quot;The Beach&quot; from someone, so I went out and bought it.  I am still trying to figure out what was suppose to make this a good read.  I forced myself to read the entire book, hoping  it would get better and it didn't.  The storyline had potential but it went  no where.  People have compared this to the great classic &quot;Lord of the  Flies&quot; well, think again...this book doesn't deserve to be in the same  category.  What I find very amusing is that the movie &quot;The Beach&quot;  is going to be released in February.  Everytime I see I movie based on a  book, I always say the book was better.  In this case--I sure hope the  movie is better or it will open and close on the first weekend.
B0000024K1|5.0|this IS the best rap/hip-hop album of all time and neither genre has been the same since.  hard rhymes with a message over funky drum beats and dead-on samples.  but not only did this album make a huge impact on rap and  hip-hop,  but it really helped shape modern electronic music as well.   everyone from Fatboy Slim to the Chemical Brothers have tipped their hats  to this record.  i even saw Beck in concert and his DJ spun some of  \\"It Takes A Nation..\\" just before the encore.   the success of  this album is not measured by total record sales, but by the respect it's  gained from other musicians and the incalculable impact that it's had on  the music world since it's release.   do i even need to tell that  you've got to buy this album?  \\"power of the people,  say!\\"
0684872153|5.0|How can one possible descibe this Memoir? It's laugh out loud funny, tragic, frustrating, shake your fist maddening, and completely engrossing.  I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  The fact that the author actually lived this tale challenges you to find something to honestly complain about in  your own life.  I am reading the continuation of the story,  &quot;Tis'&quot; and find it just as enjoyable, and have just received A  MONK SWIMMING by Mr.McCourts brother Malachy as a gift, which I'll read  next.<br />There is nothing better than a good story, and the fact the stories  are true to life, makes this book, and it's continuation, some of the best  reading I've experienced.
B000002LGQ|5.0|As Rolling Stone magazine said when it was released, Like A Prayer is &quot;...as close to art as pop music gets&quot;. That sums up this incredible album. This really is as good as it gets. Every one of the 11  tracks on this CD is a gem. It even contains my favourite song of all time,  the gorgeous &quot;Oh Father&quot;. Other highlights are &quot;Pray For  Spanish Eyes&quot;, &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;  and of course, the awesome title track.<br />I really cannot explain in a mere  review how good this album is. If you are a fan of strong, melodic pop, but  also need a bit more substance than other artists can deliver, then this is  the one for you. It's undoubtedly Madonna's finest album(Yes, even better  than Ray Of Light! ) and I can't recommend it highly enough.
6305609691|4.0|While this film is pretty unrealistic in terms of true military facts, it is a good flick that is worth buying.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This is what it's all about. Two great guitarists, each with sincere respect for one another, and a truckload of perfectly delivered rhythm &amp; blues. Songs like Matchbox and Don't Lie To Me will get you  shakin'  'n bakin', even if you're listening to it at work. The excellent mixture of  material  spotlights the great guitar work of SRV and the &quot;let's get  down to biznez&quot; attitute of Albert King, making this cd an instant  classic. Throw a party and let this play all night long for a real  boogeying time. True R&amp;B. Every time I listen to this, makes me wish  I'd seen Stevie more than once.
0767802659|5.0|I would suggest this movie to anyone.  While the movie does not follow the book, it still is a great movie (none of the Heinlein books that were made into movies followed the book...look at &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;).   As someone in the military, I thought that while the tactics didn't follow  current doctrine, the philosophy and training I could relate to.  The love  and self-sacrifice each soldier showed for each other is another thing that  also made this movie one that was near and dear to my heart.  I definantly  think this movie is one that is worth buying and would suggest this movie  to anyone who loves Sci-Fi or War movies (this book was actually required  reading for my ROTC class when I was in college).
6301868684|5.0|Jennifer Jason Leigh in the most demanding role of her life. Intense, seedy as hell, and yes, disturbing, Last Exit will make you want to take the fastest way out of Brooklyn. Director Uli Edel creates this nightmarish  borough perfectly. May freak-out viewers who aren't familiar with this  flick from a decade ago.
6305627401|2.0|I have watched South Park for several years now and maybe I expected too much of the movie.  I found it a waste of my money and had I the choice on whether to buy it again, I definantly would not have wasted my money on  buying it and would have just rented the movie.  There were parts that were  funny, but for the most part, I found it just stupid.
B0000027RL|5.0|TEN is without A doubt the best album released in the 90's, and one of the best albums of all time.From the opening of &quot;ONCE&quot; to the end of &quot;RELEASE&quot; the music grabs you and takes you for an amazing ride.  One of the all time classics. If only the band would tour more often.
B00003XB8K|2.0|I am the biggest Enigma fan out there. The first album was pure genuis! It rocked the world with a new sound that was so refreshing. The second album is a part II of the first! New songs still capturing that enigmatic  magic.BOTH ALBUMS ARE BRILLIANT!  Those are my favorite albums!  Then  came album #3 Which to me is a whole new chapter altogether. Still a good  album with a different kind of magic happening. Quite Enjoyable.<br />When I  heard this new album, I couldn't wait to listen to it with much  anticipation. I was so in shock, that my soul was not moved at the  slightest! There's way to much going on in the tracks! It is to busy with  proceessed noise. It is way over processed!   You can't even sing any  of these songs. They don't stick in your head. It is smothered with over  loaded technology. WHERE IS THAT ENIGMATIC MAGIC!  Because it sure ain't  on this album. Im so sad. ENIGMA RULES!  But not with this album! In the  eyes of my truth, You Lost The Magic!<br />Music is all about moving the  soul!<br />Enigma 1 and 2 get 20 STARS Enigma 3 gets 5 Stars This album really  deserves 1 Star... I'll be nice.
B0000009OP|5.0|The music is like a chocolate cake so dark you think it is black, and a coffee stained denim pant leg that smells of smoke from a dozen bar nights. Get some of this music soon and feel the low-down lively wave that was  Morphine.
0671502336|5.0|A fantastic novel that I read long ago, actually better now that I am a little older.  Recounting the misadventures of a flight squadron and its hero/fool Yossarian.  Heller makes it clear that everything has a catch, in this tale of damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Each character is in a  situation that is result of counteracting forces rather than free will.   Hard to put down and sad when it finally ends.  I highly recommend Catch  22.
B000002UB6|3.0|Well, how shocking.  The last album the Beatles released was the one that had all but died stillborn two years previous.  Nasty ol' Phil Spector doctored up some half-finished tunes and made himself a fortune on the  Beatles' moldering carcass...Whatever.  I'll take it over any of their  other late 60's opuses any day. Behold, the Beatles had some verve left!  Some spunk! Some pure blues-centered energy, and you can feel it.  Even the  ballads have more pathos: &quot;Two of Us&quot; is a charmer, &quot;Across  the Universe&quot; has a sweet melancholy, and the title song, well, 'nuff  said. And shocker of shockers, the Fab Four remembered how to rock:  &quot;Get Back&quot; is a great, gritty, sloppy,  hey-remember-when-this-was-supposed-to-be-fun song. &quot;I Me Mine&quot;  isn't great, and &quot;the Long and Winding Road&quot; is pretty annoying,  but hey, it's not an exact science, kids.  And sure, you wonder what made  them cut and print &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, but at least it's short (Number  9...Number 9...Number 9)<br />In a nutshell, hate Phil Spector all you want,  this album still isn't as overproduced as &quot;Sgt. Pepper's.&quot;
B00000295Y|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite next to Ice Cube.  This albam reminds me of 93 hang out with friends and cranking this albam up.  With great classics like I Want To Get High, Aint Going Out Like That, Insane in the  Membrane, Lick A Shot, and my all time fav Hits From The Bong.  A must get  for any fan.  I think this rap group desevers more attention.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana changed music as we know it.<br />Now that I said that, I want to get on to the songs before I talk about Cobain as a guitarist/songwriter.<br />01-Smells Like Teen Spirit: This, as you should  know, is a very good and well written song, with lots of genuine anger and  energy. <br />02-In Bloom: A very good song as well, with funny lyrics and a  nice bassline as well. This song is easy listening for grunge and punk  fans, I liked it upon first listen.<br />03-Come As You Are: Another radio hit  from this album, with trippy music and lyrics; really psychedelic and cool,  I found myself listening to this song over and over. Among the best lyrics  Cobain has ever written.<br />04-Breed: An absolute joy to hear, I just cannot  get enough of this song. The verses are so so, but the chorus absolutely  ROCKS.<br />05-Lithium: The third radio hit from this album, with good lyrics  and sounds just like your average grunge hit...sounds a lot like those  posers Bush.<br />06-Polly: A nice acoustic balance, easy listening even for  those who do not like Grunge; Cobain's voice is perfect in this one,  too.<br />07-Territorial Pissings: IMO the best song on the album, it  literally JUMPS out at you and speeds up more and more until the final  crash. Though the song is short, the lyrics are great and the music is  heavy as hell.<br />08-Drain You: My second favorite from this album, a bit  more tame but no less Nirvana than any of their other stuff, nothing bad  here at all.<br />09-Longe Act: A very good alternative hit and the FOURTH  radio hit from this album, the lyrics are excellent and it is as catchy as  any pop song.<br />10-Stay Away: A good song, but the album's only weak point.  Even though it is a good song, it simply cannot hold up to the other  ones.<br />11-On a Plain: A narcissistic song by Cobain that is as catchy as  any of their stuff, and rocks all the way. Definately a high point, no  question.<br />12-Something in the Way: The work of a true poet, really an  incredible ballad...Cobain's voice needed a bit of work on it, but it's  still great.<br />13-Hidden Song: An ANGRY song by the Nirv and IMO is  excellent to jam to.<br />Overall, this album is damn near perfect. <br />Now  onto Cobain...he may not have been the GREATEST guitarist ever, but at  least he played solos (even with their simplicity) as opposed to a group  like Korn, who relies on power chords. Cobain is a good singer for a grunge  band, too. No, he wasnt the greatest, but he was very good.<br />Another  standout is David Grohi, one of the best drummers in the past 20 years. He  can REALLY play well, even if he does overdo somethings sometimes. He  deserves a lot of credit for the songs being so good.
B000021XR5|4.0|I'm a huge STP fan so I was initially disappointed with No. 4.  However, the more I listened to it, the better it got.  The songs reflect his fight to live and stay clean and his sorrow and anger for losing his lover.  The  music in &quot;I Got You&quot; is a great catchy tune and  &quot;Atlanta&quot; is the most beautiful song they've done to date.  It's  so grand.  The music is very very strong; however, it lyrically is a little  weak.  Scotts creative writing of lyrics may have been clouded by  everything that's gone on in his life.  If you're a true STP fan, get it.   Nobody sings like Scott Weiland.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|This has to be in the DVD collection of every DVD lover. I have not seen a more visually spectacular DVD. The audio composition played back in 5.1 is also a delight, blending seamlessly into a real feast for the senses.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Eden is a wonderful CD! It is by far the best of Sarah Brightman! I recommend this CD to anyone that appreciates beautiful music. My favorite song, I think, is track 16, &quot;The Last Words You Said&quot;. I was kind  of disappointed when I purchased Dive, but this is wonderful! If you aren't  a fan of Brightman's,  you will be as soon as you hear this. It is one of  the best CD's I have ever purchased, and you will feel the same!
B000002J09|4.0|Anyone ever notice the general trend in customer reviews around here?  First off you got the vast majority: 5 stars, &quot;GREATEST ______ EVER&quot; titles, and reviews that read something like this: &quot;_____  rules!  They are the best!  Ever song on this album is the best thing ever  recorded and is another tribute to the genius of this band that  single-handedly saved civilization!&quot;  Then, a very small percentage of  very annoyed naysayers who all seem to be saying: &quot;This mindless hacks  have no talent whatsoever.  I cannot believe you morons submit yourselves  to this overplayed schlock, they pale in comparison to The  Beatles/Stones/Floyd/Nirvana, and your mother was a hamster, and your  father smelt of elderberries.&quot;  Hey folks, there's plenty of stars  between one and five, use them.<br />As for Zoso? Oh, this is one of my  desert-island albums. Blues pumped to epic proportions.  I can't hear the  guitar duel between Page &amp; Jones on &quot;Rock n' Roll&quot; without  chills down my spine.  Good stuff!
B00002R0MC|5.0|I THOUGHT THAT THE BOX SET WAS FANTASTIC!  I LISTENED TO THE BOX SET AND I DIDN'T WANT TO TURN IT OFF
B00003XB8K|3.0|After seeing all of the glowing reviews of this CD I made sure to listen to it a few more times, but I still don't think it is as good as the Enigma's previous works.  It is definitely a good CD, and has some great  tracks, but some of the vocals just don't appeal to me.  <br />The liberal use  of the Carmina Burana throughout the CD was a surprise.  At first I thought  it was a bit too much, but after a few more listens I really enjoyed it and  found that it was integrated well (and interestingly in some cases) with  the other music.<br />For the diehard Enigma fan I think this is a worthwhile  purchase, but new Enigma listeners should try some of their previous CDs  first.
0780619668|1.0|After sitting through this egregious, overblown catastrophe of a movie, I didn't just want a refund of the buck I spent to rent it ... I wanted the hour and a half of my life back!<br />You watch the credits at the end of this  movie and see all those little names scrolling by ... hundreds of people  involved in this movie at one stage or another ... didn't at least *one* of  these folks have the guts to say &quot;Uh, this movie really sucks, let's  fix it?&quot; before it got released and foisted on the rest of us?  What  were they *thinking*!   <br />The story has a lot of potential, there are cool  costuming effects galore and some good acting talent here, but the net  effect is a barely intelligible mishmash -- I can't figure out if this is  supposed to be a straight-up scifi/horror movie or just campy parody.  I  get the impression that the scenes that *explained* most of this stuff were  left on the cutting room floor.  If we'd actually gotten enough background  detail to give a rat's behind (uh, no pun intended) about any of these  characters, especially the hybrid animal/people, it could've been a really  interesting movie.  Even if they'd fleshed out the scientific and logistic  aspects of Dr. Moreau's work enough to make it borderline plausible, that  would've helped.  But noooo ... the entire thing just degenerates to the  hyena-guy-goes-berzerk-and-commandeers-Jeep pyrotechnics-fest at the end.   Yeah, right. <br />I think the saddest part is the waste of talent here.  It  was truly creepy watching the hulking, freakish Marlon Brando mugging and  panting through this role.  Ironically, I'd just watched &quot;A Streetcar  Named Desire&quot; a few nights before I caught this flick.  Shudder.  I  watched him in this with the same morbid, repelled feeling I had watching  Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in &quot;Baby Jane&quot;.  Val Kilmer at  least seemed to be enjoying himself, and yes, his Brando impersonation was  funny.  Mostly I just feel sorry for Fairuza Balk -- she needs to get a  better agent!
0783217048|5.0|This movie is one of those rare perfect films. Casting is brilliant (especially Stockard Channing, who only gets better and better as the years go by--and she was always totally incapable of less than a fantastic  performance). The general plotline of the movie is congenial, and the  themes are fulfilling.<br />In essence, the movie deals with the healing of  &quot;broken people.&quot; (For other such films, see such gems as  &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot;)  The unlikely angels? Three drag queens from New York City. The vehicle?  Their car breaks down in a red-neck hamlet. Unlikely hijinks and dangerous  confrontations lead to a thoroughly satisfying finale.<br />And Julie Newmar  was never better!

B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love these guys, and this album is even better than the first! Full of so many wonderful inspiring songs that just make me feel so good. :) I highly recommend it!
0679746048|5.0|This is the greatest book written on mental health and mental hospitals. If you've been in a hospital you will totaly relate.Susanna Keysen puts every aspect of hospital life and &quot;menatal Illness&quot; into this  book. Any one who is looking to reminise and find out what happens after  the hospital READ THIS BOOK!
6305531412|5.0|Simply stated, the movie is WONDERFUL. It gives us our only glimpse, ever, of Donald and Daffy together! It provides a (rather bumblingly) heroic rabbit lead! It is a fine mix of live action and animation! It is a great  detective film! It has everything needed in a great movie: drama, suspense,  sexy heroines, loathsome villains, cuteness, wit, etc. A MUST SEE! A MUST  BUY! <br />The movie is particularly noteworthy for two reasons: it marks a  fine collaboration between Warner Brothers and Disney Studios (and thus the  interactions of their characters), and it has a flawless combination of  live action and animation, and uses this very well. It still holds up even  with the sophistication of effects in more recent movies.
B00000J8EK|4.0|I think it's too bad that customers buy a new album, like Surrender, and expect it to be another Dig Your Own Hole, and trash it if it's not.  I take my hat off to the boys for trying something new rather than stay with  the same old Block Rockin' Beats routine.  I enjoy &quot;Hey Boy&quot;  because it seems more sarcastic than egotistical (their references to  'superstar DJs' and the cheerful 'here we go!'.. sounds like they are  making fun of the hype rather than basking in it) I also enjoyed the retro  80s flavor of music:response.  My favorite song on this album is Got  Glint?... it's a simple song but there's something fresh about it and the  80s flavor about it really appeals to me. Some of the melodies in this  album also have a nice eastern ring to it that is subtle but refreshing.   Someone who prefers the older chemical brothers might come away  dissappointed but if you're willing to listen to something new and  different, give this one a try! P.S. See them live if you can.  They are  wonderful and the concert's what got me into them!
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|well this is a great movie that makes you think that what if that was possible and what if we were just dreaming like slaves
0684800713|4.0|I'll admit it. I HATED Hemingway after the mandatory &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot; in high school, but when I saw this book, I had to give it a try, even if Hemingway was the author and I wasn't dissapointed. It isn't a plot filled with action or intrigue, but it is complex and fascinating in how it  describes the personal relaitonships of the  impotent protagonist Jake, his  less than innocent love Brett, and the annoying tag-along Robert Cohn along  with a slew of others that reminds me so much of the high school &quot;in  crowd&quot; I started casting the characters with people I knew. It isn't a  book for everybody, in fact, unless you like working to understand meaning  in a book this isn't the one for you. However if you're looking for more  than a casual read you won't be dissapointed. This is one of his very best.
0440234743|5.0|I needed something quickly to read for a trip and decided on The Testament by John Grisham.  I had read some of his other works (ie. A Time To Kill) and had been fascinated with his style of storytelling.  Even on  distasteful topics Grisham has a way of really getting the reader involved  as evidenced in A Time To Kill.  The Testament is no exception.   Troy  Phelan really had a unique way of sending a message to his vulture-like  relatives.  It was if I were there watching the entire scene.  I was as  shocked as everyone in the room.  I believe that I even gasped!  Grisham's  descriptive ability is astounding!      It only gets better.  The troubled  Nate is sent on his mission and endures the seemingly impossible to  accomplish the same.  I should have realized it wouldn't turn out the way  it seemed it would.  It was a great, if unexpected, ending though.  Who  said stories should have happy endings and what would that have been  exactly?  Maybe it was a happy ending after all.   It was sad in parts,  evil in parts, and very interesting always.  I enjoyed The Testament and am  eagerly awaiting his next book's arrival.
6302798450|5.0|How did such a hilarious movie end up in horror?, Don't ask me but Army of Darkness is really one to see
0783225857|1.0|This movie stunk I had to watch it in school. Talk about a bad movie i would only buy it if someone paid me twice it's value to.
6303212263|5.0|This film is an absolute classic.  I have never in my life seen such a film which had an impact on me like this film.  This is by no means a children's film, now as I am in my 20s I appreciate this film for what it  was a piece of cinema genus.  It is a shame that a lot of countries round  the world did not see the 3 hr 8 min cut of the film that was shown in KCOP  in 1994
6305657947|1.0|I was really surprised at the positive reviews for this movie.  Considering the trailers and the actors I was expecting a treat.  Instead, there was only a vague nausea and a deep dissapointment.  Universally, the  characters were so unbelievably stupid that all the beauty and grace and  costuming in the world could not salvage this film.<br />The entire plot  hinged on all involved characters doing exactly the stupidest possible  thing, even if it was a matter of seconds after saying &quot;That would be  stupid.&quot;  I am kind of happy with the fairy-tale ending.  By breeding  with each other it is unlikely the children will be smart enough to survive  to adulthood.  The idiocy could die out in one generation.  In a movie  universe...
6305161976|5.0|If you love Bogie you will love this movie. The most romantic love story. I don't know how many times I've seen the movie and everytime I see I love it more. To me, Bogart is my favorite.
0930289234|5.0|On the surface it's another well-written graphic novel with a dark feel about it. Then you delve deeper. The deeper you go the more you realise that this is a dig at society. Hero's are outlaws and criminals and the world is a mess and the people who could save us have their own problems.  The great American graphic novel... by an Englishman, now that's irony. If  this book were a song it would be Street Spirit (Fade out) by Radiohead...  beautiful, dark but with an edge of hope. Read it and realise how life  could be... IMmERse yOUr SOuL iN LOvE...
B000002JPA|2.0|Dream Theater are without doubt a fine and talented group of musicians and certainly do justice to the \\"progressive metal genre\\". I have only heard 'Falling into Infinity' and 'Images and Words' and my opinion may appear to be slightly ignorant, but I can't help but hear poorly inspired bits of Metallica, Van Halen, Joe Satriani, Faith No More, and to a lesser degree Rush, Saga and even Pink Floyd with the intro to \\"Metropolis\\".<br /><br /> I think it's fine to be influenced by these artists and there may be more that I have not picked up on, but I bought these two CDs on recommendation by a friend and am sad to say it's not what I expected.<br /><br />I guess after 20+ years of listening to bands like Yes, Rush, King Crimson, Saga, Primus, Zappa & most recently Porcupine Tree I was expecting colours and textures in the soundscapes, memorable melodies, conciseness, originality and innovation in the music. What you get is annoying keyboard runs with over drawn staccato and syncopation in the movements.<br /><br />I don't mind a bit of SELF INDULGENCE but tone it down a little, give it a groove & make it exciting to listen to.<br /><br />Dream Theater may be a powerhouse of musicianship especially with Mike Portnay and John Petrucci and whilst some parts of this album grew on me, there are just too many bland metal guitar riffs and hair metal vocals that makes it too BORING & inconsistent to fully enjoy.<br /><br />Other highlights for me included \\"Another Day\\", \\"Surrounded\\" and \\"Wait for Sleep\\" . 'Images and Words'has a great production sound with lots of dynamics in it's instrumentation but offers nothing new except for individuality from mainstream metal.
B000007OY0|5.0|Shaw Shank Redemtion, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.  Some critics complain that the 142 minute movie is too long or predictable but I think that watching this memorable  movie is worth every minute of running time.  The story is truly inspiring  and unforgettable.  The casting, music, cinematography and script create a  story that nearly anyone can appreciate.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|After having seen the theatrical release and VHS numerous times, I was pretty anxious to get the DVD transfer.  I was not disappointed, they added quite a few new scenes here and there and if you've seen the movie before  you'll really appreciate what they add to the film.  This being my favorite  movie, I'd say the DVD cut only adds to an already great movie and is  highly recommended whether you've seen the film yet or not.
6300216039|5.0|Zeffirelli's interpretation of Romeo and Juliette, is the perfect conversion from the 16th century Globe, to the to the twentyeth century wide screen. It is true to our own expectation of video entertainment and  at the same time captures the love of language and drama that is  representative of the early London stage. It is that classic video, that  you will want to re-watch, year after year.
B0000062FL|5.0|Abraxas is what great music is all about. The songs segue beautifully from one to another and each is a true work of art. The live bonus tracks are pretty nifty too. Hopefully Santana's newest album (which is only about  half good) will direct younger listeners towards this 1970 masterpiece.
B00000JLEP|3.0|I own two recordings: the Ashkenazy and Ugorski. Both are good performances and I cannot say I prefer one to the other. <br />The Ugorski is a more brisk and technically brilliant performance. DG has produced a very nice sounding album, the quality of which certainly exceeds that of the Ashkenazy performance. The CSO has quite a reputation and I won't bother with further praise here. <br />Ashkenazy's somewhat slower tempi and more liberal rubatos yield a more romantic and less technically precise and rigid performance. The Ugorski, in some ways, lacks the strength of the former. Either performance is an excellent addition to one's collection.
0679420401|4.0|Although I have reviewed dozens of books, this is the first time I have felt speechless.  It is not because I do not have anything to say, rather, it is because the book is so deep and complex and evokes so many feelings that I do not even know where to begin.  I guess I'll begin by saying  Steinbeck's ability to illustrate a book with just words is phenomenal.  The imagery in The Grapes of Wrath is so enjoyable.  Steinbeck describes  every detail perfectly.  You will actually be able to feel the hunger  pangs, sense the heat of the desert sun on the back of your neck, and feel  the hurt of death and loss.  It is truly incredible.<br /> I really enjoyed  all of the characters.  I felt they were all well developed and had  distinct personalities.  Ma was tough, but always on the brink of being  broken.  She was like a teeter-totter - the slightest weight would send her  to a breakdown.  Tom was sensible and always under control. The two little  ones, Ruthie and Winfield, were cute. I liked how they always repeated what  they heard the adults say --- even if it didn't make sense!  My favorite  character though, was Casey the preacher.  He really had a lot of insight  to life.  I liked they way he was always \\"thinking\\".<br /> For me, the only  downfall of the book was trying to understand and endure the sandwiched  descriptive chapters where no one in particular was speaking.  These are  the chapters in which other reviewers complain that Steinbeck should have  used quotation marks.  I really struggled with these.  I know they were  there for a purpose and housed a lot of symbolism; I guess that's why I was  so frustrated.  I wanted to experience those chapters the way Steinbeck had  intended, but I found it very difficult.  The good thing is that these odd  chapters are very short (only a few pages) and they fall every other one.  The \\"meat\\" of the book, (the long chapters) is where you'll get your  enjoyment.  Because of this, I am only going to give the book 4 stars;  however, this is even a struggle for me, because in a way, I really feel  the book deserves 5.stars;  however, this is even a struggle for me, because in a way, I really feel  the book deserves 5.
B000000993|5.0|TOOL has proven themselves to be giants of hard rock, and this album is the one with which they proved this. From beginning to end (69 tracks!) it is a powerful, emotionally driven album. Maynard James Keenan writes the  most intense lyrics out there, and sings them equally as powerfully. If you  need any further proof as to TOOL's music being as good as I say, listen to  the sample of Sober. Sober is one of the greatest hard rock/metal songs  ever performed. It is the perfect testament to TOOL's greatness.
0899663036|4.0|When I was eleven years old I first began reading this wonderful novel. It tells the story of a poor young girl named Francie Nolan who lives in Brooklyn in the earliest years of the Twentieth Century. No work of fiction  before or since has to me so captured the wondering observations of a child  who lives his life in emotional isolation. The shabby, mean, and colorless  streets and tenements of Williamsburg are to Francie a playground of  colors, mysteries, and adventures.  Francie bears a passionate love for her  hopeless, drunken, dreaming father. In contrast, she struggles to love her  practical, hardened, and unsentimental mother. This conflict leads to a  climax that forces Francie to achieve a balance between the dreams of her  father and the practicality of her mother. If you enjoy fiction that allows  you to see the world through a child's eyes, this one's for you.
B00003XACV|5.0|American Beauty is my all-time favorite movie. It is not only incredibly profound, but it's also very funny. The soundtrack brings back all the emotions the movie evokes-discovery, love, sadness. From Lester pumping  iron, to a bag blowing in the wind, to a rose being cut. The score isn't  very long, but each song is a wonder. I highly recommend it.
6303022901|5.0|This is really a wonderful movie... I highly recommend it... I am still waiting for it to come out on DVD, why it hasn't yet is beyond me. This is a wonderful story about family history and culture. All around a great  movie!
0441172717|5.0|Forget the dreck that comes afterwards, forget David Lynch's bizarre film adaptation - Frank Herbert's original &quot;Dune&quot; has few peers in terms of mind-bending, wholly original science-fiction.  I can't think of many other authors who have created such complete, fully realized worlds as  the universe that Herbert's characters inhabit.  Tolkein's Middle-Earth  springs to mind, and the Land of Oz...but that's about it.   &quot;Dune&quot; borrows merrily from mythology, fairy tales, the Bible,  and many other sources - and yet remains a truly original creation.  For my  money, the single best sci-fi novel ever.
0684872153|5.0|I don't know why, but I really thought this was a great book.  It was sad, witty, easy to get through, fun at times, and also very depressing.  It tells a great story, and that story is made even better by the simple fact  that its true.  I don't know what else to say.  It's just a good book.  I  hope that the movie does the book justice.
1559409010|3.0|The film is an undeniable classic and the commentaries, deleted scenes and 50 minute documentary on the Criterion version are very good.  However, the negative used to transfer this film to DVD is scratchy and the DVD really  suffers from it.  Lines (some of them really bad) are evident in most  brightly lit scenes and the sky in the opening of the movie is riddled with  imperfections.  This is probably the best print available and Terry Jones,  the Director, has approved the transfer but compared to every other DVD  I've bought this one is a big visual disappointment and is certainly not  'beautiful' as Criterion would have you believe.<br />Also, the BBC recently  conducted a Monty Python night and there were interviews etc. with the  Python's that could have been licensed for this disc.  This certainly isn't  a 'definitive' version and if you've got it on VHS then buy it for the  extra's alone... a great film, but why use such a bad print?
B000001ESP|5.0|Any RUSH fan knows that there was never a trio of talent more gifted than Alex, Geddy and Neil.  These men redefined music in the 1980's, creating a unique sound with every instrument, including voice.  This CD is a good  starter for new fans, as it contains great examples of this band's genius.  TOM SAWYER, a huge commercial hit, is memorable, as is the instrumental  YYZ.  You will also like challenging yourself to remembering all the words  to Red Barchetta.  Having seen this Canadian band no fewer than six times  live in concert, I can honestly say RUSH is the eptiome of rock talent,  right next to Queen and Genesis.
B00003XB8K|4.0|I love Engima. Not always sure why since the sound is so different than what I normally listen to. This latest CD was bought without hearing any tracks based on the greatness of the prior CDs. Since I got it I just let  in play in my car CD player over and over and over again. It is wonderful!
B00000K19E|5.0|Yes, that's right. It's destined to become a sci-fi classic along with Bladerunner and 2001. What can be said that hasn't already been said a million times. Sorry Lucas, this is the One. Finally an intelligent, well  written, action packed movie that gives the sci-fi genre a fresh face of  action, style and maturity. The raw, pure energy that this movie delivers  leaves you gasping for breath. The movie has to be seen several times to be  fully appreciated. Simply mindblowing. Oh, by the way... My personal  favourite scene is the one where agent Smith is telling Morpheus what  mankind reminds him of. It struck me how true it is.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've never heard Radiohead before...don't what the lyrics are...don't really give a damn.  All I know is that the textures and the harmonic approach on this CD enveloped me and transported me to another planet.  A  wonderfully fresh approach to good ol' rock and roll....<br />Awesome!
B000002MP2|5.0|Green Day music kicks. This is their best CD and a must buy. Any punk rock fan isn't supposed to live without this or Nimrod. The last track, FOD, is purely amazing. If you're a Green Day fan be sure to check out Nirvana and  Creed as well. If you like this Cd e-mail me and tell me about it
0553328255|5.0|I'm sure you've read enough about how spectacular and fun the book is, so I'll try to stick with the little things that make the book so appealing.  While the 4 novels become a bit long, and the short stories just a tad  predictable, there are so many barely noticeable features that make ACD  such an outstanding author.  He creates full characters in a matter of  paragraphs (for example, Prof. Moriarity is mentioned in only one story,  yet he seems like such a complete and important character).  Several times,  Watson, the narrator, mentions cases that he cannot disclose to the public.   It seems like nothing but it makes Watson seem both more credible and more  real.  I guess I'm just rambling now.  Buy this book, you'll be thrilled.
6300248569|5.0|If you want a Pride and Prejudice movie that actually follows the novel, the BBC production is by far the best and most accurate.  <br />Some will recommend A&amp;E's version...I can't help but wonder if Jane rolled over  in her grave to see Colin Firth, playing Mr. Darcy, jumping in the lake.   Mr. Darcy jumping in a lake!  It's unthinkable!  Some say David Rintoul was  stiff and arrogant...He played the part perfectly.<br />If you like Jane  Austen's stories to be portrayed as they were written, then try this movie.

B000031WD9|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for the unrated version to be better than the rated version - I was wrong.  Be prepared to laugh you head off.  About a couple of high school teens attempting to lose their virginity.   Extrememly funny
0441003257|5.0|this is the funniest book i've read in a long time. despite religious overtones, the text never gets too into it. the plot isn't confusing, but it is complex and appeals to intellect. the characters are interesting and well-developed and the horsemen are just perfect. i recommend this to  anyone who would like to laugh. also, some great quotes about God and  people in general.
B000002IGP|4.0|When I was 14, I saw Warren DeMartini jump from a dirty attic onto an elegant dinner scene in the video for Round and Round. Without hesitation, I bought Out Of The Cellar and a guitar. Both worthy investments. Though  this is the only good Ratt cd, quite good compared to Dokken, Poison and  other 80s lite-metal bands, this was the catalyst for the great pleasure of  playing guitar, which I still crank on 16 years later.
6302548195|3.0|I've been told that the reason you can't find this video is that Arnold Schwarzenegger bought the rights and took it off the market because it has a scene with Arnold smoking a joint.  Can any of you that have this movie  confirm this?  I saw it a long time ago and remember it being entertaining  but nothing really great.
B00000064E|5.0|Words fail. If you've got this far, buy this. One click. Do it now. It's the best folk album ever made.  And if you think you don't like folk music, buy this and discover you were mistaken...
B00003XB8K|4.0|The Screen Behind The Mirror came as a surprise to me because Michael Cretu had claimed to never again do another Enigma Album. The 4th album will at first take you by surprise because it is a little different than  his last three recordings. It is a lot more energetic and aggressive. At  first listen I didn't like it, but it began to grow on me. The album  doesn't have a good flow of continuity between songs as his previous  recordings have. At times, it almost feels as though he was even struggling  to try and make it stand out from previous recordings, and as a result, it  feels a little reckless when you listen to it. Not a lot of good samples on  this one as with previous albums. But it definatly has more agressive drum  beats! Look at this album as a turning point for Enigma.  I believe Michael  was paving the way for something new and different for the Enigma series of  recordings. If you liked all of the other Enigma Recordings, then you will  Definatly like this one!
B00002Z88D|4.0|This double CD set is awesome.  I originally bought it for my husband for Christmas and I have since taken it over! I bring it in the car with me to listen on the way to work and then I bring it into work to play on my PC!   Buy this CD and turn it up!
0964385619|5.0|This is likely the best non-fiction book I have read.  Of course, it requires an open and receptive mind, but the financial education is worth its weight in gold.  If you have had generations of paycheck-to-paycheck  income, you absolutely must read this book.  You will understand what you  knew all along, but were afraid to live it.
B000002LQR|5.0|this is a must have.  flea's base will blow the listener away.  it's a funky album man.  it's awesome.  this is the funkiest album ever.  funky like fishbone.
0312853238|5.0|Many had recommended me the reading of this book. Fortunately no one had told me anything about its contents. As I was reading the book I was becoming stuck to the story. However the best was still to come. How could I imagine that it was all to be sort it out as it is described? Naturally,  after reading Ender's Game I couldn't help reading the rest of the saga  (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide and Children of the Mind). I was not  disappointed at all either. One could separate the first book (Ender's  Game) from the rest but reading those other books not only adds more  information about Ender's Game but also creates new worlds and stories  which complete the whole four-books story.
6305609691|5.0|In my opinion, one of the greatest films ever.  A truely enthralling look at a war that was never completely understood.  A story of five men finding true horror in the Vietnamese jungle. As they search for Colonel Walter  Kurtz they find themselves in the most chaotic and unbelievable situations.    As if being warned off by the ghosts of the jungle through situations  seemingly out of the Twilight Zone, they press on.  They find themselves in  a war of pure carnage, a sureal place where soldiers are worshiped like the  nights of the round table, and war is not war, but a game. A game with  intangable costs; lives, sanity, and manhood.  Slowly as they make their  way to Kurtz they become entangled in a realm not of this world. A realm  where man's suffering plays second fiddle to one mans God like stature.  A  world where there will be a second comming,  a greater God,  someone who  can take Kurtz' place.  In a way Kurtz wishes his own demise.  He longs for  his suffering to end.  When it does we are left wondering, who took his  place.  This film is not for the faint of heart.  It is full of grafic  violence towards not only man but also animal.  The most shocking scene of  the movie is when Kurtz is killed.  At the same time there is a water  buffalo sacrificed by decapitation.  In 1979 they didn't have CGI, so you  can bet that that was as real as it gets.
6304602979|3.0|I'm a fan of Tarantino for the simple fact that he's never denied being a theif.  He's just the best theif there is, currently.  This updated version of Terrence Mallick's wonderful &quot;Badlands&quot; brings back many  elements of the original (mainly the music and voice-overs) but pressents  them so obviously that you'd have to be stupid to think Tony Scott or  Tarantino were trying to pull it off as their own.  Whether you want to  call it hommage, rip-off, or borrowed, it works in this film and made it  that much more enjoyable.
B00001QEE8|5.0|It's brilliant! A film with characters and songs you will never forget! A superb introduction for any child to Kipling's classic!
6302798450|5.0|This is definitely the best movie of all time, but what stinks is no one has any idea what the crud it is.  No one needs to have heard of it or have seen it to buy it.  I bought a few copies of this movie since it was so  great.  I look at the vodeos as more of a collector's piece than a video.   Everytime I get together with my friends we watch this movie and they love  it.  Bruce Campbell is hilarious, this movie isn't even scary at all, it's  more funny than scary.  But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you tape this off of the  sci-fi channel or usa or something.  The television version is much better,  there are extra scenes and some words are voiced-over.  I really recommend  you at least see this movie if you like cheaply made movies.  I still can't  determine if this movie was meant to be funny or not!
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie was pretty much over all one of the best movies I have ever seen. It had computer graphics that were great, Keanu Reeves and Laurince Fishborne were great. After all, this movie was abit confusing at first,  you will understand it once you've watched it anough , which I'm sure you  won't get tired of,. It's not only a movie about guns and the end of the  world, it's also a type of a love story between two characters. I founthis  movie enjoyable and ESPECIALLY ACTION PACKED!  I hope you enjoy it!
B0000029DD|5.0|i first became aware of jeff buckley when i saw the video for the song 'grace'.  it was a song unlike anything i had ever heard before, or have heard since.  it was one of those rare musical moments......being  &quot;blown away&quot; by a song.<br />how wonderful, too, that the rest of  the disc holds up to the promise of that first song.  shiver-inducing music  doesn't come along often...... i can't recommend an album more than i do  this one.

B00000ADG2|5.0|I think that this CD was great. From one minute Lauryn makes her voice sound like an angel and to the next her voice sounds like she has a lot of emotion in her. The songs that I really love are &quot;Ex-Facter&quot;,  &quot;When it hurts so bad&quot;, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;- her  duet with D'Angelo, and &quot;Can't take my eyes off of you&quot;. I think  that when you buy the CD, you'll love every song on the CD like I do. I got  this CD two months after it came out, and I'm still listening to it every  day. If you love Lauryn from the Fugees, then you'll love her here. You  won't regret buying this CD.

The  variety is what I think is the best thing about CAKE, and especially this,  which is there second album. The have a bit of folk (Stickshifts and Safety  Belts), Italian (Perhaps), rock, and alternative. If you love a great mix  of music buy this CD. I now have all three CAKE albums and I bought them  because of this!
0671510991|5.0|Dr. Kissinger has written a marvelous book that  takes a reader on an enlightening path through history.  Beginning with the Peace of Westphalia (the advent of international relations), the author uses his keen sense of  perception to analyze the actions of world leaders and explain how those  actions shaped the further development of the international system.  He  masterfully shows how the experiences of previous generations influenced  the diplomacy of the current generation.<br />The most interesting part of the  book is when Dr. Kissinger details the international system since the  United States entered into global politics.  He argues that the unique  American political development correlated into a diplomatic style unlike  the world had ever seen.  American diplomacy was based upon democratic  ideals that rejected states acting for individual gain.  Instead Americans  believed that the expansion of democratic ideals to all people would result  in a natural state of harmony among nations.  With this basis, Kissinger  outlines 20th century history showing how American idealism helped and  hindered in different situations.<br />Dr. Kissinger draws extensively on his  personal experience in the field, providing a more complete picture for the  reader.  The author's style is easy to read and captivating without  excessive detail and theory.  A must read for any serious student of  international politics and history, and an enlightening read for others  with an interest in global relations.
0671510991|3.0|Doctor Henry Kissinger, the controversial American political character, establishes an easy to understand, opininiated descrpition of world diplomacy over the last century and a half.  It's a little long, and I beiieve it's very redundant.  It's not a book to carefully read, but a  brisk skimming will allow you go gain the knowledge that this book offers.   A glossary would of helped.  The maps and pictures are nice.  Mike Stanton  would be proud as Henry K displays his no nonsense attitude!  Anyway, if  you are taking a high school or college world history class, be sure to  pick up a copy.  It'll take long to read but it's worth it.   It's not written to CLEARLY, I wouldn't reccomend it to my  family and friends, but to my peer students.  29.  21.
B000002I4S|5.0|Far be it from me to try to expound on the prior reviews, which were obviously written by students of the genre.  But I was simply a dabbler in jazz, checking out only &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (my first real jazz  purchase)before I bought this LP.  I was hooked on jazz after this one (and  Thelonious Monk, Genius of Modern Music Vol. II).  From the dizzying title  track to the touching &quot;Naima,&quot; this LP captures the methodical  madness that is John Coltrane.  <br />I have not bought much jazz in the last  few years because I'm STILL trying to figure out the few albums I have,  including this one.  But this LP makes jazz both fun and fascinating and  takes away the intimidation factor that may exist for newcomers.  If you  are new to jazz, buy this album and your love for the art will only  increase.   Also check out Blue Train and Crescent.
B0000020C4|5.0|Reading the other reviews I just can't understand so much cheer about everyone and not about Colm Wilkinson. Yes, Michael Ball is excellent, also Fantine, Javert and so, but what about that powerful but  relatively-old-aged voice we hear in 2 4 6 0 1! , and the absolutely  masterful performance of bring him home?. When I heard Gary Morris playing  that part in some other recording it seemed to me horrible, and now Colm  gives me my revenge. The only ones I don't like are Mr. Thenardier and  Michael Maguire for he's not powerful enough from my point of view. Also  some of the secondary actors are not at the level of, for example, the  symphonic recording. Great, although.
0451452739|5.0|2001: A Space Odyssey was everything a great science fiction novel should be.  The day I started to read this book I found it so engrossing that I finished it the same day! The book does a magnificant job of rendering detailed images to us in mankinds' quest to reach intelligent life. The  book touches on so many powerful themes, like man vs. machine, the struggle  for survival, and humanity's rise to the space age that one can't help but  think about these issues in a whole new light after finishing this great  novel.<br />The addicting storyline, along with its pleasant, easy-to-read  style will help make this book a favorite of everyone's who can get their  hands on it!  <br />My personal thanks to Arthur C. Clarke for creating a  literary masterpiece that will stand for all of time!
B000002U9W|3.0|The first Pink Floyd I ever heard was &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast,&quot; the last track on this album. It was 1971, and with certain illicit substances and headphones, need I say more? I was hooked.  But I can also understand why some are ungrokked by this album. The title  piece meanders all over the place, even though there are some cool moments  within it. David Gilmour's &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is Ray Davies with an  overdose of the cutes, &quot;If&quot; by Roger Waters is super-gloomy and  stodgy, even by his standards, and only &quot;1968&quot; by Richard Wright  really works as a &quot;song&quot; song. But &quot;Alan&quot; continues to  this day to be fun to listen to, so I'm glad I have my CD copy. Just  wouldn't play it as often as PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN----or WISH YOU WERE  HERE, for that matter.
6304613199|3.0|well we waited 4 years to see more dinos and speilberg loads this film up with them . it has plenty of action for action fans. what is missing is the wonder and awe and the breathtaking brilliance of the original.  the  characters in this one are down right dull and ignorant.the story hardly  follows chrichton's exciting book at all,and the originals cast of sam  neill and laura dern are indeed missed.instead they are replaced with a  bunch of morons. sure kids will love it because of all the dino action, but  if you love the first jp you will not love this one....it is worth the  money to watch it but theres no way its as enjoyable as the first. the  raptor scene close to the end is really good,however..it really keeps you  on the edge of your seat. but the film has horrible dialogue and it seems  as if it was made for younger kids, unlike the first one.except this one is  more violent.sure there is more dino action in this one, but tons of action  can make a movie dumb,as where the original jp relied on suspense and  wonder as we saw the dinosaurs return for the first time in years.we were  all captivated and stunned as these creatures graced the screen like never  before.thats what made the original so great,the beauty and wonder of it  all. this one seems to just have a bunch of dinos running around eating  people. but it is a good film.
6302814782|5.0|This is a very cool film and it's considered a teen horror flick. I enjoyed this movie very much and the acting was good. Corey Feldman was in so many good films like FRIDAY THE 13TH 4-5, THE GOONIES etc... I particually liked the soundtrack to THE LOST BOYS, as I soon went out and bought it. Amazingly however when I bought THE LOST BOYS, I got the special edition complete with photo cards from the film and the  original trailer. Thats a bargain.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This album presents Bowie as a sort of a combination of The Thin White Duke, Major Tom, and Ziggy Stardust, all rolled into one.  It features Robert Fripp and Carlos Alomar, who provide a nice contrast of the starkly  intense and calmly smooth guitar styles.  Intense, smooth, and musical all  in one, this is Bowie at his best.
6304813759|2.0|This comedy (so it's called) became a big hit in 1997 and it seemed everyone loved it. However upon buying it on video I found it to be  completely dull. Ok odd parts were funny, but it was'nt the funniest film  ever, and it's beyond a joke to call it Britains best comedy. I can't see  how Americans could like it because the characters talk in a northern  accent.
B00001OH7X|5.0|Until OUTSIDE, this was the best of the Eno-Bowie collaborations.  It features the ever-smooth Carlos Alomar and Adrian Belew, who gives that slightly deranged edge to the guitar.  Unlike LOW and HEROES it doesn't go  ambient on the back side, and retains it's edge throughout.
6301562143|5.0|I have always loved this film and the joker (Nicholson) is the best villian. I loved the dark, gothic sinister version that Tim Burton made, he brought Batman back to life. The sequels were a bit poor, but this is the  best and to me the only Batman film worth buying.
6300216802|2.0|Astonished humans watch as three Klingon battle cruisers are destroyed in a huge cloud which is on a direct course to Earth.  And so James T.Kirk and crew are sent to deal with the threat.<br />Unfortunately, for most of this  film very little happens.  It seems to be aimed more at '2001' fans than  'Star Trek' fans.  The characters are rarely allowed to show character and  some of the dialogue is pretty stupid ('it disappeared down what they used  to call a black hole').  Who exactly talks like that?<br />Good special  effects and a wonderfully atmospheric score save this film from being a  one-star.  Thank goodness the makers of Star Trek 2 onwards knew what the  series was supposed to be about.
6303418287|3.0|This is a fairly good attempt at re-creating a timeless horror classic. Branagh did well and his version is quite mature if what a little boring. After viewing it once I don't think its a film that I could be bothered to  watch again, instead it's covered in dust on my video shelf. As a horror  fan, I can't denie that this is still good with a good host of British  actors. Robert De Niro was pretty good as the monster but the make up of  the monster did not have much to offer, horror wise, but then like I said,  this is a film for mature horror fans.
0140072187|5.0|Robert Mason, the author of this book, tells a chilling story with treasured words and experiences about the Vietnam war.  He was an expert helicoptor pilot in the middle of a hell called the Vietnam war.   This  should be a must-read for all generations today.    WHEN WILL A SCREENPLAY  BE WRITTEN AND THE MOVIE MADE?     As a teenager (female) of the 70's, I  learned a life lesson about the war through Mason's visions and  experiences.  Mason is a great writer with a  razor-sharp memory, a keen  insight to mankind and a wonderful soul.   I highly recommend this book to  everyone.   It will take your breath away.  This is definitely on my  &quot;top ten&quot; book list.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|I love The Offspring, don't get me wrong. But some of the songs, and especially the pictures inside the case, really creep me out. Although, not completely freaky, it also has some great hits such as Pretty Fly and Get a  Job. It is a moderate album with good beats, sort of depressing lyrics, for  an all around okay CD.
0385421982|5.0|I actually found this book very intriguing because of it's witty dialect and the author's acutley sharp descriptive gift. I give it three thumbs up but since I only have two, we can imagine the third one. Thank you.
B0000067X1|5.0|I honestly think that this is some of the greatest ever recorded music. Ok, admittedly the song-writing isn't great, but to criticize that would be to miss the point slightly. The fact is, these men had no pretence to being  songwriters. Instead, they concentrated on rhythm, texture and electronics,  and, in doing so, re-invented their instruments. Tago Mago is their best  album. It opens with Paperhouse, which sounds pretty unremarkable to start  with. That is until they descend into an unstoppable, primal rhythm, which  maintains its intensity for the duration of the track. Mushroom is the  shortest track and strangely eerie, but again has some impressive drumming.  Then you get possibly the funkiest 25 minutes of music ever. Oh Yeah, uses  a wonderful cyclic groove as the base for some inventive experimentation  with backwards sounds and some great guitar imrovisation. The centre piece,  however, is Halleluhwah. Incredibly, the band manage to create an even more  complex and funky groove than on Oh Yeah, and stretch it out for far longer  and include all manner of sounds and effects (including what sounds like a  modern drum'n'bass rhythm on drum machine) to ensure that it sounds like  nothing ever before or since. This track can either be soothingly hypnotic  or funky depending on mood. From there on, Can move into altogether more  sinister areas. Aumgn is extraordinary. Mainly electronic, Damo Suzuki  seems to be trying to exorcize demons through religious chanting while the  band create a claustrophobic atmosphere with very little use of  recognisable sounds. It climaxes with an ear-bending tribal dance rhythm  and Suzuki's unholy shreeking. Peking O takes music far past the normal  boundaries of taste. Suzuki chatters unintelligably as though a thousand  demons are trying to speak through him at once. The fact that the only  words you can make out are &quot;gonna kill you, gonna kill you!&quot; adds  to the uncomfortable atmosphere. The track finishes off with a throbbing  groove which seems to have been beamed in from outer space, and sounds  unlike anything that has been created even today. It is a good track even  though people will hate how it makes them uneasy. I don't understand that  attitude, when horror films, which are made for the sole purpose of scaring  people, are accepted as good. Why can't the same apply to music? Anyway, to  calm you down, the album ends with the very chilled Bring me coffee or tea.  Slightly oriental, it is exactly the sort of track you would want to listen  to after being subjected to the madness of the previous 2 tracks. The track  is eventually drowned out by what has made this such a brilliant album in  the first place: the rhythm section. So there you have it, my thoughts on  this album. You may very well disagree with everything that i have said,  and i'll just tell you fine, stick to your travis and stereophonics etc.  But for ingenuity, humour, energy and dynamics, this band cannot be  touched.
B000020617|4.0|since bob mould and paul westerberg both threw up their hands and gave up trying to make high-octane pop-flavored rock and roll, someone had to fill the void. who'd a thunk it'd be dave grohl? this is the Sugar album Mould  always wanted to make. it's a hook and great riff-laden jamboree. buy it,  turn your brain off, turn the volume up and thank god it's still only rock  and roll.
6303168507|5.0|What a great movie this was. One tends to forget that this film surpasses the 3-hour mark, because it moves so easily and quickly. The shocking imagery of the cruelty and ruthlessness of the Germans is like a slap in  the face, and that is exactly what Spielberg wants, and achieves. This by  no means is a film to see and re-see. Once is enough, because the images  stay in the back of your mind. It is a beautifully made and shocking film,  with excellent performances from all.
0767830520|5.0|This movie is cinematicaly brilliant. Deniro at his very best.The screenplay by Paul Schrader is incredible and possibly one of the best in film history. Buy this now and your life will forever be changed.
B000001EQT|5.0|What a gaggle of sleazy, lewd, arrogant rock'n'roll.  I LOVE IT!  The incomparable Marc Bolan picked up where he left off with the landmark Electric Warrior, cranked up the Marshals even higher, injected his most  unabashedly raunchy lyrics (&quot;Gonna give up all my load/And go 'ooo  yeah'&quot;) and the result once again is an all-time classic.<br />Like only  the great albums, every track shines - and I mean EVERY SINGLE ONE.  Bolan  showed that he could rock with the big boys on heavy guitar jaunts like  'Chariot Choogle' and the terrific bonus track, 'Cadillac'.   T.Rex's  '50s-flavored jams never sparkled more than on The Slider's two major hits,  the Chuck Berry-ish 'Telegram Sam' and the trashy glam of 'Metal Guru'.    The ballads are some of Bolan's most poignant, including the deeply  introspective 'Spaceball Ricochet' (&quot;With my Les Paul/I know I'm  small/But I enjoy living/Anyway&quot;).   And then there are gems that defy  classification.  The slow groove of the title track (a personal fave) is as  infectious as the Plague.  And the melancholy 'Ballrooms of Mars' is just  outstanding - who other than Bolan could shout &quot;ROCK! &quot; as he  launches into a lilting guitar solo without sounding trite?  <br />The Slider  stands tall alongside Electric Warrior as the enduring monument of a great  pop music genius.  Will America ever appreciate this rare talent?  If Bowie  can have his revival, surely there is room for a little Marc.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is the way clerks was at sundance and should have stayed, maybe.  I agree with most critics that it was a good idea that Kevin cut the last original scene and left Dante alive(because rumor has it Clerks 2 is on its  way).  When you watch this cut with the superior sound and widescreen  format, you really feel like you are back in theatre watching Clerks for  the first time again.  After you watch it, you have the chance to go back  and view the indie-film Shakespeare explain his work and progress bit by  bit.  This is one of those must haves for anyone who has ever loved a Kevin  Smith film or just worked in a gas station or video store.
B00003TL18|2.0|When I look at all of the reissues from Orbison Records a sense of deja vu hits me. The Beatles original record company was VeeJay which had US license to the tracks on the UK Please Please Me album. That was released  in 1963 as Introducing the Beatles. When Capitol became the Beatles new US  label, Vee Jay then repackaged the same tracks with different titles (The  Beatles vs. The Four Seasons, etc.) Then Capitol bought them out (issuing   11 of them on The Early Beatles album in 1965) meaning Vee Jay was soon to  bite the dust. <br />With Roy Orbison, all of his early Sun songs are on  Rhino, his Monument songs are on Sony, and his Monument remakes, and 80's  and 90's songs are on Orbison Records.<br />Which means that O.R. has no  choice but to package, repackage, issue, reissue the same repertoire over  and over.<br />Case in point: this CD. This is now the third time it has made  an appearance. It was released around the time of the airing of the  concert. Then it was released in 1997. Now it is rehashed yet again in 2000  with only one bonus track. Had they put that track on three years ago,  there would have been no reason to release this special edition. But see,  you wouldn't have had the privilege of buying it twice!<br />Oh, and just to  further illustrate O.R.'s tactics, witness the numerous greatest hits CDs  all containing the unoriginal, remade versions of his classic Monument  songs!

B000021Y74|2.0|My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the  characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running  scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin  with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!
6305426651|5.0|Maybe I'm losing it, but this film inspired me to go outside and be helpful to EVERYONE I meet or know. It may sound cheesy to people who have not seen this movie, but pick one person out of a group who has seen this  movie, and he or she's attitude to life would have changed, they might not  admit it, but their life would have changed, if only a little bit. How many  films could be powerful enough to influence this? Think back and count.  There have been masterpieces in the past, but film, I believe, was not  created to be mastered or perfected, but to affect others, to change  attitudes. This film is a real example of that. I'm sure you all know the  simple story, so see this film if you haven't seen it, see it again if you  have, don't let the hype and people's occasionally misleading opinions ruin  it for you.
B00000K19E|5.0|I was amazed by this special effects mega-movie but I knew that if I could get my computer jaded son to like it, this would be the ultimate stamp of approval. He LOVED it! The computer related stuff was so far removed from  anything he could identify that it didn't distract him from the movie  itself. He now even sports a Matrix screen saver on his computer. I highly  recommend this &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; story.
6303481272|5.0|In order to tell you how good it is, let me tell you my viewing experience ...<br />I had followed anime from the 60's thru the 80's as a kid, and in the 90's I rediscovered it with this movie.  When I began my rediscovery I sat  thru the beginning of this film with skepticism(not from hype, just from  the cliche it exuded on first appearance).  I sat thru a 10 minute gore  fest of blood and mutilated bodies decimated by mysterious superpowerful  ancient ninja in a tribal feud during Japan's unification period 400 years  ago.  Soon, I was witnessing a dismal rape slowly unfold ... I gave the  movie 2 minutes on my watch and I was ejecting.  Suddenly, the whole  depressing story which lead me in via a thread of characters each being  killed so you follow another until their demise became a story of three  lone wolves uniting vicariously to defeat a menacing power which could  throw Japan back into the dark ages.  The story which almost had me  disgusted to the point of rejection turned into an affirmation of man  overcoming his past mistakes and failures against all odds.  This movie  kept me on the edge the whole time.  Every character seemed fragile and yet  powerful.  It makes a moral statement, and in the end covers all the bases  of  classic literature.  On top of this, put in brilliantly directed  animation, art and design.  Every character is unique and unforgettable.  A  must for EVERY action film fan or comic book fan.  This is definiely one of  the finest movies ever made, period.  Puts Disney to shame.  Very adult,  very skillful, very thoughtfully put together.  To this day I haven't seen  a finer anime movie, and am hard pressed to find many modern movies of this  genre that can compete with this cult classic.  I rank it up there with  Casablanca, M, Red, Citizen Kane and Evil Dead II.
0780624890|2.0|Well, this one didn't quite work out, did it? This modern spin on vampires has a few nice touches (like the beginning 'blood rave') but never engages the viewer. Some of the story is rather shoddy, and Stephen Dorff as a bad  guy? Please...However, if you're looking for mindless entertainment, you  won't go wrong with this, with some well choreographed fights and the  requisite amount of blood. If you're tempted by all the extras on this New  Line disc though, think again. They look good, but are VERY dull - only one  of the four rather lenghthy featurettes is of any interest, containing an  alternate ending and a deleted scene, and the isolated score is something  no-one ever listens to anyway, leaving a very good trailer which captures  the type of film that Blade is nicely (and sounds great when really loud)  and a vaguely interesting commentary, with some nice insights from Snipes.  Yes, the sound is good and it's nicely mastered, but there's nothing  special here. Even the animated menus, whilst at first impressive, begin to  annoy after a while. One for fans of gory action films only (and oh look,  here comes the sequel...)
6305627401|4.0|As an avid South Park fan I was delighted to finally get the opportunity to watch Trey Parker and Matt Stone unleashed, and boy were they ever.  Still containing all of the south park rugged and raunchy humor with the  extra bonus of not having regular television guidelines to follow.  I mean  c'mon.  Where else are you going to find Satan and Sadaam Hussein in bed  together, &quot;fooling around&quot;  if you wanna call it.  If you like  South Park and it's humor, you will like this movie.  Otherwise if you do  not have experience watching SP, then this movie might be a bad  introduction to one of the funniest TV shows around.  My only quarrel with  this movie, is the musical aspect of it.  I thought some were hilarious but  some songs were just drawn out and a momentum killer.
B00001PE4D|3.0|This 'update' of Dangerous Liaisons starts out as an enjoyably amoral, seductive film, with a campy performance from the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar. However, it then bottles out completely and delivers a  studio-friendly ending which just doesn't fit in. There's no denying that  this film is 'sexy', and it draws you in quite nicely to the world that the  characters inhabit, with Ryan Phillipe's brand of rather charmless acting  actually working in this. Of the current trend of teen movies, this is  certainly one of the best, but as I say, some people might not enjoy the  ending which completely changes the message of the movie. The commentary is  quite hectic, with so many people contributing, but the deleted scenes are  interesting with a director's introduction for each one. However, the  'featurettes' are very dull  and not as good as they sound. An entertaining  film which never quite delivers the ending it needs, and doesn't reward  repeat viewing.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is to easy to review.  Quite Possibly one of the finest films of the '90's.  All around solid acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead to all of the other supporting characters,  Heck, even the  young kid from Ally Macbeal did a good job.  There just aren't many movies  out there where absolutely nothing exciting can happen and yet be so  exciting and intriguing to watch.  Bravo.
0792839730|1.0|I couldn't wait to get A Bridge Too Far on DVD, but the quality of the DVD is so low that I couldn't stand to watch more than the first 20 minutes. The sound is extremely poor and video is so much digital noise that it's  unwatchable. I would recommend A Bridge Too Far to anyone, but on VHS, not  this DVD. I'm going to give the disc away and return to the tape version
630562285X|1.0|I am personally considering suing twentieth century fox so they can give me my 2 hours back for watching that.  2 reasons this movie even got one star:  1-Cathrine Zeta Jones slinking through those lasers 2-There wasn't  an option for 0 stars.  As much as I respect Connery's ability to command a  powerful role and performance, even he fluttered through this wasate of  time.  I am sure that the screen writer is unemployed unless the WB channel  or UPN needs a miniseries.  It just seemed like it was never going to end.
B000002KHY|5.0|As a 14 year old boy, i am expected to listen to Lymp Bizcuit and the terrible music produced today.  What a refreshing type of music James Taylor has created; like no other type around, JT's music provides a  soothing sound everytime I listen to it.  When I'm down it cheers me up.   When im too excited it calms me down. It is the greatest CD ever created.  With great hits such as &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot;, &quot;How Sweet It  Is(To Be Loved By You)&quot;, &quot;Carolina On My Mind&quot;, and  &quot;Fire and Rain&quot;, James Taylor's Greatest Hits is a must for  anyone.
0808514121|5.0|It was gewtting towards the end of my senior year in high school. My teacher assighed this very thick book to read.Her reason, she said, was this is the only book that a student with senioritis would take to the  beach. I quickly agreed with her. I just always wanted to know what the  dominatrix Cathy/Kate was going to do next. But the other characters are  just as fascinating. Cal and Aron are as different as night and day. Tom  and Dessie Hamilton are brother and sister who are toucingly close. To make  a long story short, this is a book that I would definitely recommend to  anyone
6305657947|5.0|The movie can be truly appreciated as a comic relief in a world where power and money corrupts, but in this movie, presented as a humorous and charming chase between a thief and an investigator.<br />There is perhaps no  point to the movie, but that is overshadowed by the excellent humanistic  story line.  It truly reflects the genius of the writers behind the scene,  and I personally thought it was wonderful.<br />I know people who liked it,  and I know people who didn't like it so much, but since this is my take, I  enjoyed the movie.  A lot.<br />If you are spontaneous, and enjoys a  challenging sport, I think you will find The Thomas Crown Affair a  delightful movie to keep.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I am a college student in a place where there is no rock music on the radio.  My sister gave me S&amp;M for Christmas, which has kept me satisfied because I have always liked Metallica's songs and lyrics. While I  was listening, I was so moved by the power that the symphony adds to the  already potent mixture of James Hetfield's voice and the instruments of the  band backing him up, I was tempted to go out and buy a copy for all of my  friends that share similar taste.  The music is so intense that I recommend  this album to anyone who likes hard rock, classical, or both.  Even if one  doesn't listen to this type of music usually, it is a very enjoyable  experience.
B000002J09|5.0|Yes Stairway to Heaven is THE GREATEST song of all time.  Yet don't overlook the rest of the album. Every song on this album is a classic.  If you like this check out Page &amp; Plant's most recent effort Walking Into  Clarksdale as well.
6305627401|5.0|I think this film is a must-see, must-buy. They way it deals with all kinds of today's issues so well really should be credited. The DVD isn't exactly up to scratch though. The sound quality is poor and it has no extra  features to speak of besides 3 trailors. I think they really could have  done a lot with the extra features. But don't hold that against the fab  movie
B000002VFW|5.0|This is one of the albums that are hard to come by. Lisa's debut album shows that she can write and sing equally well and it shows on the album's highlights, &quot;All Around The World&quot; and &quot;This Is The Right  Time&quot;. Other standout tunes here are &quot;You Can't Deny It&quot; and  &quot;Poison&quot;. This is that kind of music that brings in a relaxed  feeling. Other artists have tried to emulate her but she stands alone. I  highly recommend this fabulous album. Even ten years after it debut, it  still is a good listen. Highly Recommended
B00000DGUG|1.0|What an incredible disappointment!  While I can be happy for the incredibly talented Ms. Morissette's gaining spiritual enlightenment in India, it's effect on her music has been entirely negative.  Among a  personal group of musician friends, I rated her first album as best of the  year when it was released.  This second album, full of attempts to get her  message down people's throats through sheer force of volume and her already  proved (on JLP) raw power, was the biggest mistake in LP purchases I've  EVER made -- oh that I would have listened to it first instead of  pre-ordering it on the strengths of Jagged Little Pill alone....
B000002A33|5.0|This album, along with Nirvana's NEVERMIND, Pearl Jam's TEN, and Soundgarden's SUPERUNKNOWN, is one of the best albums to come out of the Seattle music scene.  It is a shame that this album never was as successful  as these three albums because it is just as good as they are, if not  better.  It's hard to say which song is the best since there really isn't a  bad one on the whole album, but the melodic &quot;Sworn and Broken&quot; is  probably the most memorable.  Other contenders would be &quot;All I  Know&quot;, &quot;Dying Days&quot;, &quot;Make My Mind&quot;, and  &quot;Traveler&quot;.  The worst song on the album, &quot;Dime  Western&quot;, is much better than the singles new bands are putting out  today.  Hopefully Screaming Trees will come out with a new album soon, but  in the meantime, I'd recommend that any rock fan to go buy this album.  It  is worth the money.
0399215921|5.0|My daugther received this book when she was 1 and loved it from the start..We never got through the story itself...we just went through and did all the animal noises. Now my daughter is 4 and now she reads the book to  me. My son is now 16 months and it's the first book he's been interested  in. Again, we don't get through the story, just the animal noises, but,  similar to his sister, I'm sure we'll graduate to actually reading the  story. If you get this book, you won't be dissapointed.
B000031XCR|4.0|In particular I love the song &quot;That's the way it is&quot;...it shows some feelings that we all know: love,loneliness...it's so romantic and truly that noone can say the contrary. I hope you all will buy this record  very soon to feel good as I felt.
B0000027RL|5.0|It's a shame they're not the same way now, as I wish they would do similar material. The Pearl Jam today is no longer Pearl Jam; it's a wannabe folk band that likes to collaborate with other artists. The Pearl Jam back in  91/92, however, were an excellent hard rock band which essentially opened  the scene for 90s alternative rock (and alternative metal). What was so  great about the album? Well, each track told a story. Not in a spoken-word  way, in a &quot;Van Morrison way&quot; with guitar riffs and deft bass work  in the background.  Their live shows were pretty cool, too.(At this point,  they're all pretty old, but they could always make a comeback!) You won't  think I'm being absurd by saying that THIS album is to rock music what The  Godfather is to motion pictures.
B000001G89|1.0|I bought this a number of years ago and was terribly disappointed.  Carmen requires fire and passion, and Berganza gives a carefully controlled and passionless rendering of the fiery heroine.  Other singers are fine; I love  Cortrubas's somewhat rough but expressive voice, and Domingo and Milnes are  always fine.  I'd say try the old recording with Regina Reznick if you  really want a classic, or try to find one with Elena Obratzova --sensuality  personified!
B00000K2SE|5.0|This is one of those rare movies which special effects actually made it what it is.It is a very watchable and interesting action adventure,scifi production.Almost constant action will keep one from falling asleep durning  it.I was most impressed by the performance of Carrie-Ann Moss whom i could  not recall seeing in much of anything before this movie.My favorite scene  is at the very beginning where the agent is asking the Police why they  disobeyed orders and sent officers in to get her before they arrived.The  police officer said &quot;I think my men can handle one little girl&quot;  and the agent replied &quot;your men are already dead&quot;.I am not  usually overly impressed with alot of the special effects used in movies  today because they detract from the actors and the overall production  value.However i am going to make an exception in this case.I was so  impressed i am ordering the directors cut ,widescreen version.
630460291X|1.0|My reveiw is not about the movie itself.  The DVD is a flipper.  After watching the movie most of the way through it you have to get up and flip the disk over to see the rest of the movie.  dont waste your money on this  one until they re-release it dual layered.
B000002TWN|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am a fan of true hip hop music.  As such, I don't put much stock into R&amp;B.  I pretty much think that it sucks.  I love D'Angelo's &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot;  Although he's classified as an  R&amp;B artist, D'Angelo is really a hip hop artist who happens to be a  singer instead of an emcee.  He covers a wide range of topics and does so  with intellegence, humor and wit.
0451196716|5.0|This has got to be one of the most disturbing Stephen King books - or any book for that matter. Its story plot is genius! He puts you RIGHT THERE with the walkers - my favorite was McVries. It's mind boggling and defintely not a story to be forgotten soon...at all.
0375707972|1.0|I did not care for this book in the least.  First off, I felt that it read at a High School level and was in no way interesting to the adult reader.  Schlink begins The Reader in mid-story.  We have no background or character  development.  One day Michael Berg, the main character, is sick in bed and  the next he is having sex with a woman twice his age.  Then we turn the  page and she is a Nazi war criminal.  As Schlink takes us down this some  what interesring story line he still forgets to develop the characters.   Why should we care what happens to Hanna?  Schlink did not reach me on a  moral or philosophical level, he could not even reach me on an erotic  level.  All in all, this Reader was a let down and I would not recommend it  to anyone.
B0000214F3|1.0|This is definitely the worst film Anthony Hoplins and Brad Pitt have ever done. The most contrived, stiff, pretentious film I ever saw. Yes, I sat through the 3 hours. Terribly cliched dialogue, and the daughter cries crocodile tears through the whole film.  Brad Pitt's character is Mr. Death, and the film asks you to relate to and empathize with Mr. Death and asks you for tears during the Spielbergian violin well ups. Every tape of this film should be burned.
B00002E285|5.0|I must say from the start I am a big fan of Pink Floyd but to see this video, you don't have to be.  I was estatic when I heard that after 1 too many years of torment they have re-released The Wall.  This video has some  of the most incredible animation that I have been exposed to and when it is  paired with the music of Pink Floyd and a great scattered storyline, it  makes to be one of the most interesting, original piece of art I have ever  seen on film. If you took the time to read these reviews I think your mind  might already be made up so prepare yourself for an experience you'll never  forget.
B000002C1X|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant albums I've ever listened to. Roger Waters is a genius. This album is a true Masterpiece.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I have always found Moby to be less than excellent.  Occasionally I would hear a track of his that was worthwhile, but overall I was unimpressed until &quot;Play.&quot;  Ironically, I was indifferent to the first single  &quot;Bodyrock&quot; which I thought was boring.  I still skip it more  often than not.  &quot;Machete&quot; is sorta tired as well.  (Oddly  enough, these are the only two tracks a fellow listener liked.  Apparently,  he and I stand on opposite sides of the spectrum.)  As for the rest of the  CD, I think it's really beautiful.  The idea of sampling blues and gospel  seems hackneyed originally but I find it to be very moving.  &quot;Find my  baby&quot; is extremely cool.  &quot;Why does my heart....&quot; might make  you misty.  &quot;Natural blues&quot; is incredible as well.  Each song is  pretty damn good.  It'll grow on you.
B000002699|5.0|In A Silent Way is a remarkable album because it is a new vocal language in Jazz music. While the structures of these compositions are not a departure from their hard bop and be-bop predecessors, they present a new  sound and voice in jazz music. I do not possess the musical expertise to  explain to you the theoretical merits of this album, but I will allow my  own subjective aesthetic response attempt to explain what makes this album  so unusual. The multi-layered synthesizers provide a texture which Jazz  music had not experienced to this point. The further Davis went in his  fusion experiments, the more important this textured sound became, this is  very apparent in Pangea for example. However, at this point in Jazz music  this had not been attempted. Electric music was new, Davis had introduced  Jazz to electric instruments on Miles In The Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro.  However, In A Silent Way is something beyond these two records. I think the  difference is in the musical analogue. What I mean by this is that the  sounds you hear are hardly staccato, but compose a certain humming sound,  reminsicent of Mingus but different in their almost meditational/dirge like  sound. If you don't follow me, I suggest listening to Indian music and  Mongolian throat chanting, in those styles you hear the elongated hums you  find in this record. Another reference I recommend is the song  &quot;East-West&quot; on the Butterfield Blues Band album of the same name.   In A Silent Way rhythms are layered and provide an almost tangible blanket  which covers the remarkably intricate playing of the soloists, Wayne  Shorter and John MacLaughlin for example. You obtain a heightened sense of  the subtlety and dexterity of these lighter and airy lines: note Shorter's  saxophone solo on the composition &quot;In A Silent Way/It's About That  Time.&quot; He plays in a grove which weaves in and out of the textures of  the synthesizers.  When you listen you will become acutely aware of the  myriad voices of this album which produce an astonishing final product, one  which seems far beyond the many minute parts and intricate facades of the  individual instruments. This album is a stratling event, one which can  hardly begin to be touched in a short, 1,000 word review. I hope I have  shed some light on the subject.
1573226521|4.0|While The Beach may start out slow, the pace speeds up when things start to get intense in Alex Garland's mythical island paradise.  Perhaps the best thing in this book is Richard, the main character.  He sees a dead man  that we meet in the first chapter, watches as people get more primal and  agitated by each other, and have to stand by as a predicatably violent  climax looms closer.  He is by far the most interesting thing in this book.   This is a very adult book with lots of adult language, nudity, sex,  violence and blood, and tons of marijuana smoking.  Apparently, the only  thing to do in paradise is get stoned.  The writing is fluid and  well-paced.  Despite the books shortcomings, this is a very good character  study and Lord of the Flies take-off.  This is definitly a one-night read.
B000002BBY|5.0|Beh...  il miglior CD di sempre, quindi una scelta obbligata per ciascun amante della buona musica! NOn ascoltate chi lo ha valutato sotto le 5 stelle... non capisce niente!
B000000OSE|5.0|This cd is a Guns n' Roses classic. There is such a variety of music. You have the hard rock Guns n' Roses and you have the ballads such as &quot;November Rain&quot;. This song is so great and I put it up there with  the greatest songs of all time. &quot;Coma&quot; is another favorite of  mine on this cd. Other good songs are &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;,  &quot;Dont Cry&quot;, and &quot;Dust in Bones&quot;.
B000006Z0T|1.0|Yeah well, I put this cassette on by deck and start to run it. It begins with crushing riffs that break through the air. This band really kicks forward! But, after  20 seconds, UDO DIRKSCHNEIDER starts to sings ( oh  God, please no! ), and my whole world collapses! If this isn't a conflict,  what is then? The guitar and the music itself crushes through my  consciousness, but this horrible noise of inferno, which they claim to be  his vocalscore just drops me from my cloud. I'm sorry, but vocals DO change  music, as I now have to confess.
6303430570|5.0|This movie became one of my all-time, favorites in 1994 and I always recommend it to anyone looking for a movie. It was fresh in 1994 and it still is as funny and fresh in 2000. The line &quot;I'm not even supposed  to be here today&quot; is one of those memorable lines that anyone who's  seen the movie can recognize the minute they hear it.
B0000012Y1|4.0|I'm always of the view that this is a grossly under-rated and neglected recording. Kubelik's conducting is, by any standard, masterful - the tempi are always well-chosen, the tension never sags and the build-up to the  great climaxes are both natural and inexorable. He is keenly aware of the  structure and beauties of the score and is able to convey them to the full.  The performance of the orchestra is excellent and the choral support is  also fine. The chief vocal glory of the set lies in Gundula Janowitz's  Elsa. Her singing is of instrumental purity and her phrasing impeccable. If  she's dramatically a bit on the cool side, her's is certainly one the best  sung Elsa ever. James King copes well with the vocal demands of the title  role but his voice is, as always, a bit monotonous. Gwyneth Jones is a  squally Ortrud but her vocal characterisation is quite marvellous - her  calls to Elsa in Act II can chill one to the marrow. Thomas Stewart is a  competent Telramund who copes valiantly with this actually very demanding  part and Karl Ridderbusch makes a solid and majestic King Henry. The  smaller roles are generally cast from strength. It's indeed a fine  performance that one shouldn't miss, in particular as the set is in  mid-price.
B00000K19E|5.0|The hollow book, which hid illegal sony minidiscs in an earlyscene, is labelled &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;.  If you wantto learn what &quot;The Matrix&quot; represents, read this book.  It's not easy reading, and is translated from French (post-modern thought). <br />(exerpt) &quot;Such is simulation, insofar as it is opposed to representation.  Representation stems from the principle of the equivalence of the sign and of the real (even if this equivalence is utopian, it is a fundamental axiom).  Simulation, on the contrary, stems from the utopia of the principle of equivalence, from the radical negation of the sign as value, from the sign as the reversion and death sentence of every reference.  Whereas representation attempts to absorb simulation by interpreting it as a false representation, simulation envelops the whole edifice of representation itself as a simulacrum. &quot; (p.6, Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard)
B000001GBJ|3.0|At first listening, I liked this CD quite a lot. Upon repeated listenings, however, I found it to be repetitive and uninspiring. It is good background music, but it is as if each track has a 'movie soundtrack' soundbyte theme  to it. Good only if you really like New Age style music.
0783225970|3.0|First, this is the greatest film, known to man, al pacino's strongest role,and charactor, aside from carlito, in carlito's way, another film i'd recomend, anyways, this film, is amazing, the extras are great, but  universal, did a horrible job with the picture quality, get the widescreen  edition, on v.h.s. for the best picture, it's THX, this transfer is  sorry,and it brings tears to my eyes, I got dvd, so I could see pacino,  light the screen on fire,and this, sadly I can't recomend this version,  because pacino needs to be seen, in a digitial transfer, this has alot of  artifacts in the picture, be aware if you purchase, but I can't say it's  horrible either, your decision, but this is the movie, to see it was the  movie of the millenium, right alonside carlito's way, if you wan't to see  some films, that will make you love, film,and life itself, these are it.
B0000067X1|5.0|This is Can at the peak of their powers, starting into a trilogy of releases that, for most, define the Can sound. The entire first half is just a total attack, with Damo now comfortably in his role as the voice of  Can. A very rough, raw sound prevails throughout, one that wouldn't pop up  again for perhaps 20 years or more in rock records. The havoc continues  right through total flip-outs like 'Mushroom' and 'Oh Yeah', and into the  marathon 'Hallelujah'. Then part two...originally record two when this was  on vinyl...revs up with the incantory creepiness and noisefestivity of  'Augmn', and just keeps right on attacking with 'Peking O'. Finally, 'Bring  Me Coffee or Tea' intervenes to wrest the controls away from these crazed  musicians. Those who consider themselves 'alt' should be required to own  this record. This is the one, folks, that everyone from Public Image Ltd.  thru Sonic Youth to Labradford, everywhere in between, and still going  seems to have gotten more than a scrap of ideas off of. Possibly one of the  most essential things out of Europe, rock-wise, of all time.
B000031WD9|5.0|This film is great.These are real people we went to highschool with. Not caricatures.Lots of laughs.I fell of my chair when the girl told the last&quot; When I was at band camp&quot; story !

B000002L1L|5.0|The classic mkII is back here with a new set of powerful tracks. The sound on this album is somewhat a mix between Perfect Strangers and Blue Light. As it turned out later, this would become the final work of their classic  lineup.
0060900075|4.0|Huxley's now classic book which gave inspiration to the rock group, is curious in that you are reading the explorations of one mans mind on mescaline. However, I cant say I found it the most exciting book I have  ever read. This book certainly has its place in ones philosophy library,  perhaps psychology as well. Popular with those who like to experiement with  mind drugs as well.

B00000AF95|4.0|I consider myself born into the 2nd phase of Kiss music.  Born in the mid 70's, Alive, Destroyer,and Love Gun were already considered old.  Heaven's on Fire was the first Kiss song I ever heard, and at the age of 8, I was  hooked.  Obviously I am older now and can compare Animalize to the 70's.   First, all Kiss music rules but I think that if you want something a little  off the same old, buy Animalize.  Don't compare it to a different style of  rock music.  Mark St. Johns and Eric Carr blow away the limited talent of  Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.  Kiss didn't need make-up to sell millions of  copies of Animalize. Listen for yourself.  Worth the money!
0767822900|5.0|In a day and age when adults are stealing kids' innocence by producing movies that are dark and often disturbing (see the mixed reviews of the animated &quot;Madeline in Paris&quot;), this is a refreshing delight.  No,  it's not for adults, it's for kids, so the Hollywood reviewers need to let  the kids decide if it has merit!    My 3 daughters LOVE IT!  My four year  old watches it regularly, and I can actually listen to it in the background  without getting tired of it!
0425152251|5.0|Now I say it's &quot;Not just 'Sophies World'&quot; mainly because reading this beautiful book is like entering another world of intrigue and beauty.   Don't fear that it is only for aspiring philosophers....just fear that by  the end of the book you a true believer that ANYTHING is possible!    'Sophies World' is written through the eyes of a child....who expereince  some weird and wonderful things!  Please forgive me that I am not writing  any intracies down.  I read the book 3 years ago, so detials are a little  fuzzy...but the main thing is that I still recommend it to people who I  think are open to something a little different....People who are willing to  think outside of the circle and are willing to allow Gaarders descriptive  words capture their imagination... Allow &quot;Sophies World&quot;.....to  become your world for a while!
0800141660|3.0|I love Sense &amp; Sensibility, so much so I have worn out my VHS copy.  So I was thrilled to get the DVD version - UNTIL I WATCHED IT.  The &quot;widescreen anamorphic&quot; format is very distorted. The full  width  is there but they force the height to fill the screen, thus unnaturally  &quot;stretching&quot; the actors. Wait for a letterbox version before  buying the dvd.
630305904X|4.0|I find it continually annoying that people, and especially reviewers, make the cardinal error of comparing films with the books they are made from. Doing this is rather like comparing a poem about a tree to the tree itself.  The tree is simply the inspiration.  A poem is not meant to be a literal  representation of its inspiration.<br /><br />Orlando The film is a separate entity from Orlando the book and should be viewed as such. In my humble opinion, if one sees this film with out bias or a prior notion of what it should be, one invariably sees it for the lovely jewel that it is; not without flaw but beautiful and engaging just the same.
0060977493|4.0|The language and dialogue of this book is beautiful. The metaphors are wonderful. I loved reading this book--up until the broken the &quot;love laws.&quot; At first, I thought I hated what happened. But now (a day or two later), I feel manipulated. I'm going to reread and let the quality of  the writing outweigh the weird end (which it does).
0792833236|5.0|Even though I found &quot;GoodFellas&quot; to be a better film, Martin Scorsese hit his peak in 1980 with &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, a very true to life story of Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro in his finest performance). The  opening scene shows a middle aged LaMotta rehearsing lines for a show he  will perform later in the night.  All of a sudden a much younger LaMotta is  in the ring.  The film deals with how LaMotta's jelousy, violent temper,  and sexual frustrations and how his only punishment is when he takes a  beating in the ring which he brings on himself.  It also explains how his  behavoir helped to ruin his life and his career.  Joe Pesci gives a stellar  performance as Jake's brother Joey as does Cathy Moriarty as Jakes' wife.   The boxing scenes are extroidinary and very brutal.  The oscar winning  editing is some of the best.  Why Scorsese lost the directing Oscar to  Robert Redford is crazy and confusing.  And why the film lost best picture  to &quot;Ordinary People&quot; is rediculous.  &quot;Raging Bull&quot; is a  true classic of acting, directing, scripting, and all other good things  that come in a movie.  A flawless film.  Don't miss it.
B000023VR6|4.0|I think this CD is very good because it has alot of great rappers on it, such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem,and Mc Ren. Because of all the great rappers the CD is non stop hiphop and I would recomend this CD to anyone  Who likes rap, also it is your money well spent.
B000002JK2|5.0|This would be ex-Faces Ronnie Lane's next-to-last record. [He would release only one more solo album, 1979's See Me, before multiple sclerosis no longer  permitted him to record.]  Together with Pete Townshend they  create a memorable album.<br />Rough Mix kicks off with the most Who-like of  the albums tracks--&quot;My Baby Gives It Away,&quot; which is propelled by  the drumming of Stones' drummer Charlie Watts.  Townshend's vocal  performance is fine, but he doesn't have the instensity that Roger Daltry  could have added to the song.<br />Only two other tracks rock as hard as the  opening track.  The instrumental &quot;Rough Mix,&quot; which features Eric  Clapton's lead guitar and the organ work of John &quot;Rabbit&quot;  Bundrick, who would go on to tour with the Who in 1979.  The other is  Ronnie Lane's &quot;Catmelody,&quot; a jumping number featuring Stones  sideman Ian Stewart on piano.<br />The rest of the album is a mostly accoustic  affair. One of the album's standout tracks is Lane's absolutely gorgeous  &quot;Annie,&quot; which features his former Slim Chance members Graham  Lyle on guitar and Benny Gallagher on accordian.  Equally lovely is Lane's  &quot;April Fool&quot; with Clapton on Dobro. Townshend also turns in one  of his prettiest melodies and excellent acoustic guitar playing with  &quot;Keep Me Turning.&quot;<br />Only the string-laden &quot;Street in the  City&quot; seems out of place on this disc, and at over six minutes is too  long.<br />The album closes, however, with the melancholy &quot;Heart to Hang  on To&quot; with Lane and Townshend sharing vocal chores, and the Don  Williams country classic &quot;Till the Rivers All Run Dry.&quot;<br />This is  one of Townsend's strongest non-Who projects and Lane's contributions are  stunning. If you enjoy either of these artists you will enjoy this  collaboration.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000001EL7|5.0|After having 23 years of critiquing KISS for myself, and always looking forward to newer material, I must say this is a definate must-own CD for the die-hard original-KISS fan like myself.  It's the last cohesive studio  effort by the fab-four, and one that holds it's own through every new CD  that has ever been made through this very day; thereby, it attains classic  status.  This is classic KISS, now with Ace on vocals--SHOCK ME rocks! Ace  has been a quiet force in guiding the KISS sound since their first  self-titled album; but now instead of writing songs for the others to sing,  he takes the vocal helm with SHOCK ME; SHOCK ME would not have gone over  the top if another member sang it, it is ACE's singing that boosts this  debut to the outer limits! All the other songs have a place on this  CD...they are your great, basic rockin' KISS tunes that have a hint of  cheese (goofiness) in them that endear them to our hearts.  KISS will  always be the hottest band in the world--this album is what took them to  their soared heights of popularity back in 1977, and it is what keeps them  at that exact same heights to this very day!  CHEERS!
1885283148|5.0|Without doubt this is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read in my life.  Mike Collins is an exceptional writer who brings to life the excitement of his Gemini 10 and Apollo 11 missions.  The author tells the  story like it was and tells it with candor and frankness.  In reading the  book, I often felt like I was a part of the Apollo 11 adventure.  Some  previous reviewers have commented on the fact that Mr. Collins sometimes  lets his ego show through in his book! Who cares!  Who among us would not  be bursting at the seams with pride if we had been lucky enough to say that  we had been to the moon? One of the best things about this book is that the  reader realizes the sacrifices these wonderful astronauts made.  Today we  often complain of long work hours, but look what these astronauts went  through almost everyday.  Flying T-38's to contracting plants all over the  country or spending countless hours lying on their back in the spacecraft  simulators.  Consider that along with trying to juggle having a family and  being harangued by the press all the time and not to mention autograph  seekers.  The job might seem glamorous, but it was tough.  While the  astronauts are are people just like us, they do deserve all the credit in  the world for risking their lives on a daily basis.  They are heroes and  Mike Collins is one of them.  All in all, this book is truly fascinating.   No matter how often this story is told and retold, it never gets old.  The  great achievment of the 20th century is the moon landing and Mike Collins  was part of it.  &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot; certainly represents the  best in space exploration literature as evidenced by continual strong sales  even though it was published in 1974.  If you care anything about the early  space program and the Apollo 11 moon landing, look no further than  &quot;Carrying the Fire&quot;.  You will love it.  Thank you Mr. Collins  for this wonderful book.
B000001EKX|5.0|This is one of the GREATEST CDs ever made...that's the only statement that needs to be made.  Despite the remaster being unable to attain the crystal-clear sound of a new production, the quality of the music  overshadows any question of CD quality.  This is KISS at their best: nice,  basic, tight hard rockin' music.  Each and every song has found a place at  their concerts from any era (even the Unplugged sessions).  This is a  cassette that I've owned since my parents bought it for me (at my request)  when I was 9 years old; and now I'm the proud owner of the CD which will  carry through the rest of my life.  If you like rock at all, this is THE  one studio album that should be in your collection...and it's  bargain-priced, so what have you got to lose?
B000021XS0|5.0|Wow!  I am 38 and don't say wow anymore but wow!  I sat through the whole new Dream Theater &quot;Scenes From a Memory&quot; last night and read the lyrics as it played.  All 77+ minutes.  I would say it ranks up there with  the great concept CD's like Camel's The Snow Goose, Pink Floyd's The Wall,  and Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick.<br />I don't know of anything else like it  in the metal-prog world.  Maybe IQ's Subterrania or to a small degree Rush  2112.  But it has enough slow parts to keep the metal from overwhelming.   There are so many subtle touches.  An introduction by a therapist, acoustic  guitars, the sitar and piano, a short bit of ragtime, a play on Roger  Waters I think from the Wall, female background vocals, several ballads  with great James Labrie vocals, background sound effects.  Even the liner  notes contain an old newspaper clipping of the event and a suicide note.  <br />Hope many of you out there give this one a try.  I think it is very  worthy.  Time will tell how much of a masterpiece it truly is.
B000002NIW|2.0|Chino has an awesome voice, but this CD is lacking something that the first one had.  &quot;My Own Summer&quot; is the best song, and is on the MATRIX soundtrack, which is a whole lot better than this CD.  Like I said,  this CD is good, but if you want te real deftones buy the first one
B000009VOL|5.0|I just recently became a fan of Cat Power. I love this cd. I have played it so many times Im afraid it is worn out. I am a little surprised by some of the negative reviews this cd has received. I think a few people need to  listen to this cd again. I found it haunting and it has me transfixed.
6305078564|5.0|It has it all, drama, romance, and comedy. One of the outstanding British mini-series of all time. The scenery both inside and out is fantastic. The acting is superb. It is interesting that although it is a romantic comedy,  there is a tension building to many small climaxes and then to one  fantastic ending that anyone who loves the British genre will enjoy.
B000002AP1|3.0|This remix is so distorted that it is difficult to listen at even moderate volume, and the material cries out for a good cranking.   In the liner notes, Iggy even states that he insisted on  pushing every meter deep into the red.  Get a clue, Iggy.  Those meters are  there for a reason.  I give it 3 stars on the strength of the material.   Too bad the mix isn't better quality.  A missed opportunity.
078322804X|5.0|-Excelent sound and music -Lots of added scenes (some good some bad)<br />-this DVD had an excelent behind the scenes that  was very interesting -excelent DVD for an excelent movie
6300181553|4.0|Holiday Inn is a great movie for holidays, especially Christmas, and quite fun and cheerful.  It's also a movie with a lot of internal contrasts.  <br />Portions of Holiday are quite sophisticated and surprisingly modern; the  self-referential movie subplot is nicely tongue-in-cheek and wouldn't look  at all out of place in a modern film.  <br />Quite a lot of it is naive and  highly sentimental, particularly the love triangle and the traditional  holidays.  Astaire and Crosby almost make you believe in chivalry.  And  Bing Crosby singing White Christmas is enough to give anyone a memory  transfusion - you'll find yourself remembering idyllic Christmases past.   Even if they didn't actually happen.  Even if you don't actually celebrate  Christmas.  <br />And, of course, one part of is totally enmeshed in the nasty  political and moral sensibilities of its time.  That would be the treatment  of the blacks in this movie, with a special emphasis on the song for  Lincoln's Birthday.  This is the part of the film that requires a step back  and a very deep breath.  Yes, it's horribly insulting and rather degrading;  there are lines that will make anyone born after 1950 squirm with  discomfort.  It's also very typical of the time in which the movie was  made.  If you aren't capable of accepting that, you will hate this movie.   Don't bother with it.<br />On the other hand, if you're willing to forgive the  past its faults, this is a really sweet movie - with just enough wit to  guard against total sugar overdose.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I suppose it could have been much, much worse. Given enough money, Hollywood producers tend to believe that big bucks equals big movie  equals big payoff - wrong, in too many counts to recall. The thing is, Armageddon  is definetely, not a bad movie. Is stretches plausible fiction to the edge,  rips it apart, chews on it for a while and then spits it out matter-of-fact  way, everybody-will-believe-this style.It's not deep as the rather  underrated Deep Impact, which belies a story, a purpose and 3  dimensionality to the plot - for once, America stands defeated - other than  Mars Attacks! it's largely unprecedented in box office blockbusters! Back  to the movie, it's wonderfully scripted, tightly following the best  Hollywood has to offer, the soundtrack is rather excellent and image  quality, specially in this DVD outing is superb. Bruce Willis plays  himself, as usual, the quiet, sarcastic, my-way-or-the-highway type, and  pulls it off with the usual savvy. Will Patton is underused but still  manages to impress by his serenity, Buscemi goes bonkers (again) Liv Tyler  goes for the attitude-child approach and nearly falls flat in  her(admittedly pretty) face, Ben Affleck is the I'm-so-cute-you'll-puke  rebel, vaguely remembering his lines, but pulling his act together in the  last 15 minutes. It's not Capra, Hudson, DeMille or Spielberg, it's not  Cameron or Tarentino (or Rodriguez, for that matter), but it is a splendid  way to spend a couple of hours, surrounded by Dolby Digital sound, facing a  50 inch screen, with some popcorns and some lovely company. It's what  movies should be (chewing gum), and not films (food for the brain). Enjoy,  live the moments, cherrish the feelings and sensory overload, forget the  inconsistences and plot-nots, then go on living. If you want something to  chew on for quite some time to come, try &quot;Deep Impact&quot; - less  spectacular, but far better actorship and plot.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher really strikes gold with this terrific CD of dance tracks, great pop melodies and production values while singing gorgeously.  She has never sounded better -- powerful, sultry and engaging.  I have listedned to this  CD daily it seems for the past year.  It's very infectious.  I highly  recommend it! Best tracks are &quot;Believe&quot;, Love Is The  Groove&quot;, Taxi, Taxi&quot; and &quot;Dov'e L'Amore&quot;.
0783221487|4.0|Dune the movie is an outstanding translation of Herbert's *very* original novel.  If you read the book (and I HIGHLY recommend doing this before you see the movie) you'll find that the fusion of gothic and sci-fi story  elements are well represented.  But, be aware that Dune is a complex story,  with at least six interweaving plot elements and the movie will likely be  incomprehensible if this is all you see.  And so I give the movie 4 stars  because it is such a literal translation of the book that it needs some  explanation to the lay moviegoer.  Get the expanded version if possible!
B00003XB8K|5.0|&quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; was definitely worth the wait!  Each and every song on this album is a true enigmatic experience.  I place this album right up there next to MCMXC a.D.  I love it  more that the  previous two.  All Enigma fans will be greatly satisfied and if you are not  familiar with the music, buy this cd, turn off the lights, lay down on your  bed and listen to it with your headphones on....the experience will take  you away!
1573226521|5.0|This is truly the best book I have ever read. It captures the imagination and throughout leaves you constantly craving more of the story.<br />Particularly in the character of Richard, Garland has pefectly  drawn out very convincing thoughts of how he acesses various problems he  encounters and how he tackels social situations. Thoughts which would cross  all of our minds in these situations.<br />However having seen a trailer for  the film version, staring Leonardo di Caprio, I already belive the film  will be a dissappointment. In about a minute of film the number of changes  I saw to the story were enormous. None of which seemed to have been for the  better, and all of which seemed to take something away from the story.<br />I  found that some quite significant and symbolic moments in the plot had been  completly changed.<br />Whatever you do, read the book before you see the  film. This is a brilliantly original first novel by Alex Garland - well  worth a read!

6302054982|5.0|This movie is a truly powerful mobster movie.  It is a hardcore action movie with all of the greatest features of a mafia movie.  It is the second greatest gangster movie of all time, behind the rather large shadow of The  Godfather.  Joe Pesci is definitly the motivating comedic force behind this  awesome movie, while DeNiro and Liota offer some great action scenes.  I  think it has a better story behind it than the Godfather did.
0788805843|3.0|this was a great movie but the accuracy is what makes this movie not so good! There were a lot of things that werent true in the plot! the music was great but they need to correct the problems with the accuracy! like  hades wasnt evil and hera wasnt the mom...

B000002UAX|5.0|Well, what else can be said about the greatest band this universe has seen and will ever see. It is incredible that even 30 years after their untimely break-up, the Beatles are still selling classic albums to old and  especially new fans. But it doesnt surprise me because they're the tops.  This is the perfect album for anyone who just generally appreciates good  music,(melody, harmony, rhythm, etc.). This awesome double album (CD) has  just about every style you could imagine, from country to hard rock, and  orchestral numbers to gentle ballads. So I highly recommend that if you are  a fan of music, you need to get this masterpiece (all Beatles albums are  excellent, too). Oh, and to those Beatle-bashers who wrote earlier on this  review list. Just because the Stones, or whoever you deem worthy enough to  out-do the Beatles, are your favourite, please remember that in polls  taken, 99.9% of music lovers enjoy the Beatles for their pure genious in  music, and jealousy will get you nowhere, so stop whining about every other  band (and/or) artist that you think are better, because lets just face  it-Beatles are and always will be the cream of the crop!
6305064490|5.0|This is without any doubt a superb classic. Jimmy Stewart &amp; Donna Reed outstanding.  The only fault I have is that most people think you only watch it around Christmastime.  Sure, the snow scene is significant, but  this is an excellent portrayal of the potential value of each person's life  and can be watched anytime during the year.

B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's debut album &quot;No Angel&quot; is definitely the best music purchase that I made in 1999.  A friend recommended the album to me after she heard &quot;Here with Me&quot; on the radio in California.  I am a big  Sarah McLachlan fan, and this album does have some of Sarah's vibe.  Still,  I think it is original in its own right.  I love the way that Dido combines  real instrumentation with ambient and electronic sounds.  I kid you  not...there is not a bad song on this entire album, and everyone I know  that has heard it has loved it.  Although some of the percussion has a  trip-hoppy feel, the melodies are lovely, and Dido's voice is full of  emotion.  It kinda reminds me of a mix of Sarah McLachlan, Sade, Caroline  Lavelle, Mono, and Morcheeba.  Congrats to Dido on a superior debut album.   I just can't wait for more music from her.
0767903811|1.0|Seems a rehash of his &quot;Notes from a Big Country&quot; book which came out the same year. The main difference appears to be the cover! I would rate that one 4 stars. I am giving this one just one star and that is for  the new cover. If you have read Big Country, save your money.
0792833686|5.0|This movie is an absolute joy, and words can not be said that will do it justice.  Many comments here, however, have complained that it was not presented in widescreen.  To put it simply, this is NOT a widescreen movie  and it should NEVER be presented that way.  The same goes for &quot;Gone  With The Wind,&quot; &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; &quot;Casablanca,&quot;  Citizen Kane&quot; and thousands of other titles.  When these movies on  presented on television, they are presented full-screen (no letterboxing)  because that's the way they were made.  To present them widescreen would be  like presenting a widescreen movie in pan &amp; scan.  So please, let's all  be careful before we scream and shout that a movie wasn't presented in  widescreen.  Not all movies were made in that format.  Most pre-1955  movies, in fact, were made to perfectly fit the television screen.  So if  you think you're missing something by watching a full-screen version of  &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; you're wrong.  If you watched a widescreen  version of it, THEN you would be missing something.
B000002A46|4.0|One of the best Christmas CDs one could load into his player
B00001ODHL|5.0|What a great DVD! This DVD has so many features its unbelievable.  Lets start out with it being digitaly remastered by THX.  The picture and sound are so crisp and clean its unreal. It also features the original widescreen  aspect which looks great.  And oh yeah, did I mention it comes with the  original directors cut which is 15min longer than the theatrical cut ? Only  downside of the the new scenes in the directors cut is that they are not  DVD quality, they are very dark and moody.  Also included is a making of  featurette which is very interesting to see with all the behind the scenes.  There is also commentary by Bruce, and Sam.  Which is very fun to listen  to. Also included are 4 deleted scenes including a alternate begining.  And  there is an alternare ending on the first disc. And so much more. Pick one  of these babys up if you can find one...Groovy

0684874350|4.0|Frank McCourt's book Angela's Ashes was a MEMOIR. It was intended to be a truthful and vivid account of his REAL life. I thought it was wonderful, and I learned a lot about what life was like for indigent families in Ireland. Yes, the scenes were graphic and tragedies seemed endless, but it  was VERY well-written. I think a lot of people didn't like the book, either  because they were expecting a delicate, sugar-coated tale of his childhood  or simply because the story forced them to evaluate how many things they  took for granted in their own childhood. Guilt can be a terrible  thing...Also, how can anyone say that there was too much sadness?  This is  an ACTUAL account of someone's life. I applaud Mr. McCourt at having shared  his pain with his readers. For all of those who did not like this book,  next time, pick up one of those predictable romance novels from the grocery  store; leave the emotional truths and real-life stories to the rest of us.

B000002O51|5.0|I've had this disc for several years and I keep coming back to it. After having gone through all the phases and listened to all the genres, from Metallica and Slayer through Bob Marley, Garth Brooks, Kitaro, and Kenny G  to Bach and Beethoven, this disc keeps finding its way out of the big box  and into the CD player. There are very few discs on which EVERY song is  listenable (especially after several years), but this is one of them. Well  deserving of every last star.
0684874350|4.0|This memoir by Frank McCourt 's Irish childhood has been praised to the sky. Not only has it won major acclaim, but everyone I know has loved it.  I can see why.  It has great characters and tears at your heartstrings.  You'd have to be made of stone to not relate to the sad and impoverished  childhood of the author, and his matter-of-fact courage acceptance of  it.<br />The one word that stands out when I think about this book is  &quot;food&quot;, or lack thereof.  It's surprising this man is still alive  and kicking at the age of 68 when I read about his childhood diet.  Mostly  small pieces of bread and tea and sugar water for babies' bottles.  He  yearns for an egg as if it is the most precious thing in the world.  And  when there is nothing else, he licks the grease off the newspapers that  have wrapped fish and chips.<br />The family lives on the dole.  The father is  a drunk.  And yet I can't hate the father.  He comes across as a man with a  problem who loves his family even though every penny he has goes to  &quot;the drink&quot;.  There's lack of clothing, unheated living spaces,  cruel relatives, illness, and the death of little children.  All is sad.  And very moving,  And real.<br />I think of my own childhood.  More food than  I could eat.  Electricity. Plumbing. A warm house.  A father who supported  the family.  A mother who wasn't worn out from hunger and overwork.  There's a lot to be thankful for.<br />It's a good book.  I have to recommend  it.  And yet it took me over a week to read because every time I picked it  up I kept falling asleep.<br />I read a lot of books.  Some of them pull me  right in and I can't put it down till I finish it.  That's rare though.  I'll abandon others after the first few pages.  Mostly I generally look  forward to reading what I've selected though.  I didn't look forward to  reading this and found it a chore to finish.<br />Perhaps I had heard too many  rave reviews and expected more.  Maybe it is as simple as that.  There's a  certain thrill about discovering a book on my own which was missing.  However, it seems I'm the only one in the whole world who felt that way.  Do read it for yourself though.  It's certainly worthwhile.that.  There's a  certain thrill about discovering a book on my own which was missing.   However, it seems I'm the only one in the whole world who felt that way.

B00000IO4J|1.0|Robert Rodriguez proved with &quot;El Mariachi&quot; and some of his other films that he is indeed a talented director, but what made him think that &quot;The Faculty&quot;, this Body Snatchers rip-off for Generation Me, was going to work? The special effects are cheesy, the story is cliche-ridden,  and the only real redeeming element is that the teenagers in this movie  (who are mostly played by 20 year old actors, I might add) actually seem  like realistic teenagers. Poor Rodriguez, I hope he fares better with his  next movie.
6301969588|5.0|I enjoy this movie everytime I see it, which is about six times now.  The people in the Carnival are a treat to see and it has an involved plot line.  The revenge of the &quot;freaks&quot; in the end make the movie a true  winner in my eyes....
B00001ZULV|4.0|I had been looking forward to buying this CD for about a month before it was released, and I was not disappointed with it's included material in almost every way. You see, I'm mostly a fan of both Phil Collins' and Peter  Gabriel's SOLO music in general, as I have Collins'  &quot;12&quot;ers&quot;, &quot;Serious Hits...Live!&quot; and his recent  &quot;...Hits&quot;, as well as Gabriel's &quot;So&quot;, &quot;Shaking The  Tree-Sixteen Golden Greats&quot; and &quot;Us&quot;. So when I bought this  collection of almost all Phil Collins-era Genesis songs, I was very pleased  with the song selection. My song-by-song overview: 1. Turn It On Again-From  1980's &quot;Duke&quot;, I hadn't heard this one before, but I grew to like  it quickly. 2. Invisible Touch-I had always liked this one. 3. Mama-I  didn't care for it's style of slow rythm. 4. Land Of Confusion-When I first  heard this one, I confused it with &quot;Heat on the Street&quot;, one of  Phil's solo efforts from &quot;But Seriously...&quot;, and I enjoyed it's  rock beat. 5. I Can't Dance-The trio's sense of humor is showcased, but  this one I only sort of like a little. 6. Follow You, Follow Me-From '78's  &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot;, one of my favorites! 7. Hold On My  Heart-A slow ballad from 1992's &quot;We Can't Dance&quot;, is my absolute  least favorite on this CD, which really should have been replaced with  &quot;Never A Time&quot; instead, to me, that has the right style of a good  slow song. 8. Abacab-From 1981, I also had not heard this one before, it  took a few times hearing it to grow on me, and to like it a little more. 9.  I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)-The only song included from the  &quot;Peter Gabriel As The Lead Singer Era&quot;, is to me, almost as bad  as &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot;. Like I said, I prefer Gabriel's solo  material. 10. No Son of Mine-A hit from the summer of 1993, this tune has a  depressing theme, but not too bad of a rock rythm. 11. Tonight, Tonight,  Tonight-Yes, former reviewers, I know that this is the &quot;Radio  Edit&quot; version, and not in it's entirety like from &quot;Invisible  Touch&quot;, but for what it's worth, this is still one of the best  &quot;Phil Collins Era&quot; songs. 12. In Too Deep-One of the better slow  ballads from Genesis, or from any adult-contemporary band played on the  radio in the '80's. 13. Congo-Now, people, it is here where I find this  album's major weakness. Taken from 1997's &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;  with the band's new lead singer Ray Wilson, after Phil decided to leave for  good after recording &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot;, his 1996 solo  effort. I can't even comment on the considerable mediocrity of this tune's  sound, and on the decision to include it on this legendary bands  &quot;Hits&quot; collection. Next, please... 14. Jesus He Knows Me-Once  again, some tongue-in cheek humor is incorporated, with the theme perhaps  striking a nerve with religious and business individuals in general the  world over. 15. That's All-From 1983, it has a fairly decent sound. Not one  of my true favorites, however... 16. Misunderstanding-When I learned that  this song would be included, I was very happy indeed. Easily one of the  very best Genesis songs (with Phil Collins) ranking up there with  &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; and &quot;Tonight&quot; X 3. 17. Throwing  It All Away-Like &quot;That's All&quot;, a pretty fair effort. Not really  that bad, I guess. 18. The Carpet Crawlers 1999-As I am not too familar  with &quot;Gabriel Genesis Era&quot; I have never heard the original, as  well as old-time classics like &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;  or &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot;. But I do like the fact that,  with this, it's Collins and Gabriel together! What more could a casual or  hardcore Genesis listener ask for? Well now, all in all, this CD is  excellent, for the type of person who grew up hearing many Sung-By-Collins  songs on the radio, asI did. My four-star rating, and not five, is only  because they should have included &quot;Never A Time&quot; instead of  &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot;. I still have &quot;We Can't Dance&quot; to be  able to hear that one. So now, you can be your own judge of all these songs  for yourself, of course, but I will always treasure this gem of a  &quot;Hits Collection&quot;! Thank you, I'm outta here!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This is a pretty sweet CD. Some of it gets a little tiring after a while, but there is always a song to suit my mood. The best tracks are Just Like This, Break Stuff, I'm Broke, and Trust?.
B000005S0V|5.0|I purchased this double album in Germany in 1997 after learning that it was an import. My aunt and uncle living there also own this, which they enjoy almost as much as me, since I have more free time to be able to play  my music more. This is truly &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot; for  Elton John lovers, as it includes the best from almost all of his 1970's  and '80's albums, with only three notable exceptions. I feel that  &quot;Elderberry Wine&quot;, &quot;Levon&quot;, and &quot;Club At The End  Of The Street&quot; should also have been included, as the Jon Bon Jovi  version of &quot;Levon&quot; from the &quot;Two Rooms&quot; compilation  pales in comparison. Anyway, my absolute favorites in this collection would  have to be Elton's version of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;,  &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; (a little strange for an Englishman to  sing about American patriotism), &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Don't Go  Breaking My Heart&quot;, his 1976 #1 hit, &quot;I Guess That's Why They  Call It The Blues&quot;, &quot;I'm Still Standing&quot; (also included on  the now out-of-print 1994 compilation &quot;Earthrise-The Rainforset  Album&quot;, If you can find a copy, I highly recommend it),  &quot;Passengers&quot;, &quot;I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That&quot;,  and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. I feel Sir Elton was at his &quot;Very  Best&quot; in the '70's and '80's, while the majority of his '90's material  has not been up to former standards, with the exception of &quot;Simple  Life&quot; and maybe the two from &quot;The Lion King&quot; and the 1997  &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot; remake. All in all, this is definetly the  album to get if one has a liking for Mr. Dwight's true classics. I may need  to buy a new one, as this current copy is worn down by the many times I've  heard it. So, find one and buy it, for the good times to be remembered!

Cindy shows you exactly what to do and goes at a pace that the &quot;totally unfit&quot; can handle.  Radu  seems to want to go faster but Cindy stays at a great pace and the reps are  in a count to where you dont have to do all but as many as you feel you can  do.  I definately recommend this video for all work out types.  If you  havent ever worked its great! And for those a little more advanced than the  rest of us, it lets you do more and harder exercised later in the tape.

B000005E3K|5.0|I bought this CD, because it is fairly cheap, and because it also has Ave Verum. I really enjoyed how well this conductor worked the vocal (and instrumental) parts together. That alone is worth the price of this recording. Also, the whole requiem fits together well. It makes you want to  listen to all of the CD, not just one song. The most important thing for me  is that the sound quality is really good. It is not only that it was a good  studio digital recording. The performers themselves are exellent. This CD  is well worth the price.
078322608X|4.0|I had forgotten just how much I liked this film until I got this DVD. There are just so many things going on in it that I think you have to see it several times. I really liked the whole \\"I'm cured I'm no longer insane I can stay here\\" aspect. Bruce Willis & Brad Pitt do fine work, and while some may find Pitt's acting a bit over the top, he seems in touch with the character. The DVD extras are nice too especially Gilliam's comentary which adds to the film. Willis is just plain excellent. I would not hesitate to recommend this to someone who likes the 6th Sense.

Peck has had the unique priviledge of observing and learning from his patients. Dr. Peck  has offered to share his opportunities and wisdom by writing this book. I'd  tried to read this book numerous times, it wasn't until I reached a  crossroads in my own life that I was truly able to read the book -- and  then I plowed through it in a week.   <br />One tip - don't just read the  parts you think you want (i.e. LOVE) -- the book's wisdom lies in how all  the pieces fit together...<br />Dr. Peck - thanks!
6304044836|4.0|Like most people, remakes of classic films usually leave me cold.  There have been notable exceptions such as 1992's &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; and this charming update of the Audrey Hepburn original.  I  am as big an Audrey Hepburn fan as anyone; but the original  &quot;Sabrina&quot; was not one of her better films.  Humphrey Bogart was  woefully miscast and looks extremely unhappy throughout that film.  If  someone thinks there is a lack of chemistry between Ford and Ormond, then I  would like to hear what someone would call the chemistry between Bogart and  Hepburn.  Icy?  Non-existant?  Bogart's offscreen relationship with Hepburn  was cordial, at best. In fact, he questioned her acting ability, saying  something to the effect that she was a nice enough girl as long as one  enjoyed re-shooting the same scenes over and over.<br />That friction  translated onscreen and the result was the original &quot;Sabrina,&quot; a  romantic comedy which was not particularly romantic and one of the few  light comedies that included an attempted suicide scene.  As a romantic  comedy, the 1995 remake is superior.  No, it's not Oscar material.  It's  lightweight fluff, but extremely well done lightweight fluff.  The cast is  good.  The story is cleverly updated for modern audiences.  The direction  is fairly even paced.  The crux of the entire film, though, hinges on the  romantic chemistry between the two leads.  Does it work?<br />The story of  bachelor-for-life Linus finding love without expecting it with the  beautiful and charming Sabrina would not work without that chemistry.   Personally, I believe the chemistry between Ford and Ormond is good enough  to make the story believable.  Good enough is far better than the  non-existant chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn.  Maybe Ford is too old.   Maybe Ormond relies too much on her doe-eyed beauty than her acting range.   Yet it worked for me.  I am quite moved when the very hurt and confused  Sabrina is confronted by the lovelorn Linus at film's end.  The romance  works and that is why this remake is superior to the original.

6300215717|5.0|Before I saw this film, my opinion of Audrey Hepburn was that she was just &quot;the other Hepburn.&quot; That opinion changed when I saw Audrey's face when she wakes up in Gregory Peck's bed.  Kate who?  &quot;Roman  Holiday&quot; made me a huge Audrey Hepburn fan and I have since watched  virtually every one of her movies.  &quot;Roman Holiday,&quot; though,  still remains my favorite.<br />On a side note, I recently watched a film from  1943 called &quot;Princess O'Rourke&quot; and its similarity to &quot;Roman  Holiday&quot; is eerie.  That film stars Olivia de Haviland as a princess  who escapes from her confined life and falls in love with a common  American.  Unlike &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, that film cops out in the end  with the customary, but rather unbelievable, happy ending and I think that  is why that film has been relativily forgotten.  It was the combination of  Audrey Hepburn's and Gregory Peck's (miscast my foot!) performances and the  poignant, bittersweet ending that made &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; an  unforgetable classic.
B000002J1O|5.0|'Selling England'represents the top of Genesis production. It's the most creative, enjoyable and mature album. Yes, 'The Lamb' is a masterpiece, but probably it has to be cosidered the first Peter Gabriel's solo album. After  this, after Gabriel's departure, the Genesis showed againg their strong  creativity with 'Thrick of the tail', but then diverted to more easy  sounds. 'Selling England' represents the climax of all the progressive era.  After this album no other band could create anything better. And still  today,after all these years,  I feel shivers down my spine listening to the  intro of 'Dancing with the Moonlight Knigth'. Try it.

0767819543|5.0|It may not be well known in the moviegoers' world that besides the parts of main actors and director the producer is a very important person, too. In this case, as in many other gems of the movie world, Arthur Cohn from  Basel/Switzerland, is the man &quot;behind&quot; and forcing these  projects. Did you know that Arthur Cohn has received more Academy Awards  (Oscars) than any other producer and has also his own star of fame on the  Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles? And besides: he is not American, he is  Swiss. &quot;Central Station&quot; is most certainly another milestone of  loveable masterpieces Mr. Cohn produced. The actors are wonderfully great.  The plot looks almost like coming from an old Cassavetes movie (yes, the  one with Gena Rowland and the kid running away from criminals), yet it is a  Brazil road movie of its very own. It is so good to watch such movies from  time to time, between all these bang bang megamillion &quot;box office  hits&quot;. Go on, Arthur!
B000009EUM|5.0|The best a-ha album by far. Every track is pure synthpop heaven. Morten's falsetto is untouchable and soars over the electronic instrumentation with such emotion. &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; and &quot;I've Been Losing  You&quot; will tug at the heart while &quot;Cry Wolf,&quot; &quot;Scoundrel  Days&quot; and &quot;Looking For The Whales&quot; will make you dance.  Eventually the band became more guitar oriented and Morten's voice  deepened. If you enjoyed the first album, you will love Scoundrel Days.
B00002E23H|1.0|because this was just a waste of time. Elvira please take note, this ones for your show. I agree with the one reviewer who said they felt they lowered their IQ by watching this nonsense. Anyone that could say something  good about any part of this film must be extremely easy to entertain. On a  positive note, if you find anyone who enjoyed this film, you can take their  opinions as a contrary indicator.. .  Now if only the sharks escaped then  went up the L.A. river and ate the producers and actors of this film by  snatching  them from their cars as they commuted to work. That would be  just as easy to believe as the rest of it. Extremely bad acting on all  accounts.
0790736039|3.0|The movie was suspenseful, but it didn't startle or frighten me.  I liked the scene in the Chinese restaurant as well as the clown.  If this had been an actual movie instead of a miniseries, it would've been much better.  That's my opinion, anyway.
6305546797|5.0|Halloween has always been my favorite horror movie and one of my top 5 favorites of all movies.  Ever since I saw it on tv when I was 5, the theme music, the doctored up Shatner mask, and the voice of Dr. Loomis (Donald  Pleasance) has brought back some wonderful and very horrifying memories.  I  have bought it on vhs twice and watched the laser disc at a friend's house  but nothing compares to the Restored THX certified DVD edition.  The  picture is so clean, that the only thing that reminds you that the movie  was made in 1978 is the clothes and hair styles.  The second disc (which is  not easy to obtain since it was only released on a limited basis) is the TV  version with a couple scenes thrown in that are not in the theatrical  release.  Since the first time I watched this movie was on TV and I have a  tape of it, I am used to these scenes and they are nothing new, but they  kind of add a bit to the story (the whole sister element).  The only thing  I would have liked to have seen was a commentary by John Carpender, Jamie  Lee Curtis, and Deborah Hill (Which the Criterion Laser Disc has).  Still I  recommend this version over that one any day.  _
0679409920|5.0|This book presents a very believable portrait of espionage during the cold war. No guns, no gadgets, no glamour. Just a drab monotonous life infused with constant paranoia and ending in tragedy.  Quite a contrast to Our Man In Havana, although the main characters share much of the same insecurities  (as most Greene characters seem to).  The hero is a completely sympathetic  character who loves his wife and child and hates the cruelty that the world  has shown his wife and will surely show his child.  And although he has  become jaded and old he idealistically decides to punish the West for its  racism by spying for the East (ironic considering the level of racism in  the East). In the end he looses what he had, he looses what he loved, and  he gains nothing. This was the first Graham Greene novel that I read, in  high school, 15 years ago. It hooked me and I have read most of his other  works since then.  Many other authors have created stupid banal characters  living the seedy life, but only Greene (in my limited reading) has created  human, complex, intelligent characters.....living the seedy life.
B000001ELB|5.0|Before Kiss split up to record their solo albums, Neil Bogart decided to release a greatest hits package, with some remixes and a new version of &quot;Strutter&quot;, to keep the fans happy.This album is a definitive  overview of Kiss up to that point in time.The remixed versions of  &quot;Calling Doctor Love&quot;,&quot;Hard Luck  Woman&quot;,&quot;She&quot;,&quot;Black Diamond&quot; and  &quot;Firehouse&quot; are all great; even &quot;Strutter '78&quot; is  bearable.My only complaint is that they did not include &quot;Shock  Me&quot; and &quot;Shout It Out Loud'.This is a better greatest hits  package than SMASHES, THRASHES,AND HITS and there is not one duff track on  it.
6305165912|4.0|Stories about kidnappings must be an obsession of Joel and Ethan Coen. In &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, the victim is Bunny Lebowski and Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski (no relation) is given the task to deliver the ransom to the  kidnappers. This ransom is paid by Bunny's husband Jeff Lebowski (again, no  relation) and of course it takes a while before it reaches its  destination.<br />This absurd plot just functions as a device to stage a  series of funny scenes. &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is very often  extremely silly but nearly always on target. The casting of the movie is  absolutely marvelous. Jeff Bridges is sensationel as 'The Dude', as is John  Goodman as Walter, the guy who thinks he's always right, though he's always  wrong. The supporting actors all have their moments, too. Only Steve  Buscemi isn't given the opportunity to show his skills.<br />My main criticism  is that the film is a little to long. The last half hour doesn't have the  relentless pace and gag density that the rest of the picture has. One could  also complain that the film has no substance whatsoever. But then again  there are comedies that may transport substancial material and forget being  funny, which a comedy must be before it can be anything else. &quot;The Big  Lebowski&quot; obviously knows that.
B000002LLC|5.0|I agree with most of the other reviews. This album is one of Madonna's most underated and overlooked, yet it's probably her best(along with &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;). Her voice sounds absolutely incredible on  tracks like &quot;More&quot;, &quot;What Can You Lose&quot; and  &quot;Sooner Or Later&quot;, and she displays her unmatched versatility by  reminding us of her &quot;helium-voiced&quot; past with the fun tracks  &quot;I'm Going Bananas&quot; and &quot;Cry Baby&quot;. But really, check  out &quot;More&quot; to hear an incredibly impressive vocal from Madonna.  She sings this one flawlessly, and it's a tough song to sing! There isn't  one bad song on this album, every single track is a gem. Also impressive is  the way &quot;Vogue&quot; is seemlessly appended to the album, by  immediatley following the dance track, &quot;Now I'm Following You Part  II&quot;. I don't think I need tell anyone how great &quot;Vogue&quot; is,  do I?<br />To sum up, buy &quot;I'm Breathless&quot; if you want to hear  Madonna's finest vocal moment(Yes, even more impressive than her  &quot;Evita&quot; vocals in my opinion), and some very, very classy songs.

B000002LEE|5.0|Two bands from the late 80's were of great importance, one being Jane's Addiction. For comparing which  album was best though may be confusing since live bootleg tapes circa '88 were being circulated containing most of  their work which was later released.The other band of notoriety was the  Pixies. And both delivered incredible performances.
B00001U0DP|4.0|If you are the type of person who at the end of a movie can reflect for days on the scenes that you saw ... then buy this movie. <br />This is a good movie but to get the complete story  I recommend to watch the movie more  than once. There are many suttle things that are important to the story and  are missed easily.<br />Half of the movie is comedy the other half is drama.  Worth buying ..!
078322947X|5.0|I've seen this great film on the big screen three times and was blown away each time. Excellent cinematography, intense characters, and dismal settings catapult you into the the story for one hell of a ride. This looks  and feels like a documentary, making it a real nail-biter. The eerie and  haunting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is so trippy, years ago I would've  freaked out!. If you know someone with a huge tv screen have a Sorcerer  party. Definitely at the top of my dvd collection!
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is the best U2 recording ever! The finest ballads and the stongest anthems are in it. &quot;One&quot; is, at the same time, a love-and-betryal song, and an emotional cry against AIDS. &quot;So  cruel&quot;, &quot;Who's gonna ride your wild horses&quot; and &quot;Ultra  violet&quot; are, in fact, the passion of four irishmen through lyrics and  music. &quot;Mysterious ways', &quot;Even better than the real thing&quot;  and &quot;The fly&quot; show us that the power of a good guitar-bass-drums  sound is never gone. And &quot;Tryin' to throw your arms around the  world&quot; gives us hope and stregth enough to keep doing it. Believe me:  I know U2 from A to Z and I can tell you: this is a masterpiece!
079073382X|5.0|It's amazing how close I was to passing by this movie at Blockbuster. It was a treacherous day, and I needed a good movie, and I stumbled, almost literally, upon &quot;Before Sunrise.&quot; Besides the fact that I am in  love with Ethan Hawke, I found the small blurb on the back of the cover  interesting, so I rented it.<br />I am going to agree with everyone and say  that this is one of the most underrated, and unnoticed movies there is out  there. I have never before heard of this movie, but it is amazing. The  actors, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are so natural you begin to wonder if  there was a script for them to memorize at all. It seemed like the director  just placed the two of them in Vienna, and then followed them around with a  camera crew all day and recorded their every thoughts. The acting is  flawless, and you almost begin to wonder if the two young actors had an off  screen thing going. Their chemistry on screen was so...wow. I don't think  people in real life have such great chemistry! <br />This movie with only two  cast members is beautiful. The script is pure genious(although I still  refuse to believe the two actors even follwed a script). It is a movie that  has not Hollywood-ized the plot, it wasn't sugarcoated, it was just  perfect...

Out of all the books we read, this made the most impression on me because of the reflections on modern society.<br />Whether you agree or disagree, think it's  fiction or fact, one thing is sure.  This book makes you wonder where our  planet is headed and what can we do about it.  <br />Sentences would leap off  the page to me and I found myself bringing that one particular thought up  for conversation at our family dinners or in conversation with  others.<br />This book definitely gets an A+ from me.

May I, at the very least, offer you my humble opinion of this  work? I will start by saying that NOTHING can make you smarter, wiser, more  astute, or more creative... There is not a teacher nor an author that will  transform you into a &quot;million seller&quot;.  However, there MAY be a  work that can HELP you to unlock the &quot;closed doors&quot; of your mind.    I bought this to help me overcome &quot;writer's block.&quot;  I learned  that I block my own life in various ways that have NOTHING to do with my  craft. This work means absolutely NOTHING if you already know everything.

0767019954|5.0|Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is such a sprawling, grand example of the Victorian novel that any mere two-hour movie adaptation will be forced to leave out crucial elements.  As it is, this six-hour BBC film version  emits certain items (Jos Sedley's ultimate fate, the James Crawley  episode), but is remarkably faithful to its source.  Indeed, a television  mini-series is the best way to adapt such a work, allowing the story to  unfold and the viewer to become involved with the various  characters.<br />This production is fantastic, with beautiful costumes,  excellent performances, and a fine script.  Chief among its attractions is  Natasha Little in the key role of Becky Sharp.  Miss Little is not only  luminously beautiful, but manages to arouse our sympathies toward a  virtually unsympathetic character.  Special mention must also go to Jeremy  Swift, whose portrayal of bumbling Jos Sedley is a delight.  Miriam  Margolyes (always wonderful) and Eleanor Bron appear in secondary roles.   The rest of the cast is well-chosen and all play their parts with  conviction.<br />The greatest hurdle a filmed version of &quot;Vanity  Fair&quot; faces is how to convey the many shifts of tone which Thackeray  goes through in the novel.  This problem has been solved by use of an  unusual score, which draws from such diverse sources as military marching  bands, Strauss waltzes (wrong for the period but who cares?), and a bit of  Kurt Weill.  Murray Gold's score never lets us forget that we are in the  world of Thackeray's biting satire, and not Jane Austen's more delicate  world of comedy-of-manners.<br />All told, it will take a long time before  this film treatment is bettered.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This work represents all that the people of the world must do.To comunicate with each other!  And what SRV,and Albert King done is really that! And what comunication!  Perfectly in all the ways,this moments  are rare,full of intensity feelings.....Really a gift to all of  bluesfans!  If you want to begin to listen blues music,this record  &quot;in session&quot; is a great step!It reveals the linkage between  traditional electric Chicago blues of Albert,and the modern spicy player of  the new blueblood SRV!  I really agreed about the information that Albert  was always at B.B. shadow.I love B.B.'s music but definitely Albert's music  and his way to play are most sensual,intense.....really a joyfull music!
B00003XB8K|3.0|Not exactly an Enigma album, but certainly a showcase for Michael Cretu's talent, &quot;Screen Behind The Mirror&quot;, is a romp through a drab electronic landscape, falling far short of what one might have expected  from Enigma (barring Le Roi Est Mort).  Obviously a fortune was spent on  gaining the rights for Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, as it appears in  no less than 4 tracks on the album; one totally gratuitously, and a second  time entirely unnecessarily.  It bogs down the otherwise redeeming  &quot;Gravity of Love&quot;, shifting focus from the mercifully  un-distorted sound of Sandra Cretu.  (One track is also a shameless rehash  of almost the entire first album)   Cretu, however, insists on flanging and  distorting almost every other bit of vocal talent in each track, ultimately  degrading the sound to high-pitched, echoed &quot;blahs&quot;.  Good luck  drawing anything out of the lyrics.   There seems to be little soul to this  album, although the cover art is littered with self-actualizing  admonishments.  It's good background music, but it isn't quite worth  listening intently to.  This latest release falls a distant second to a hot  cup of tea and an Anne Rice novel.<br />Bottom line:  If you like Enigma, buy  it, you'll probably like it anyways.  If you've never heard them before,  start with &quot;MCMXC a.D.&quot;
B00001QGPR|2.0|As long as masterpieces like &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; are available, there's absolutely no reason for buying this plastic and commercial album. Many songs are just empty, flat-sounding pop fluff. After  his more experimental mid-'90s work, this is a sort of sellout and probably  a blatant stab at the record charts all around the world. Many people claim  this to be &quot;fabulous art&quot; because it's Bowie. O.k., it's Bowie,  but this album is among his weakest.

0440234743|5.0|At the conclusion of the first chapter, I knew this old man and disliked him intensely.  Grisham paints a portrait of a mean, disillusioned and vengeful father/grandfather who is determined to control his family's lives even after his death.  As the story unfolds, I found myself identifying  with the insecurities and self-doubt of the protagonist, a recovering  alcohlic/drug user lawyer who is sent on an impossible mission to find the  sole heir in the Brazilian jungles.  You'll find yourself rooting for his  success and sympathizing with his failures along the verdant, flooded,  overgrown way.  I wanted this lawyer and the heir to become a couple and  live hapilly every after, but in usual Grisham style we are denied a simple  easily foreseen conclusion.  I was surprised and saddened by the end of the  book, but here was real life the way it happens to all of us.  Can't wait  for the next Grisham publication.

0671015206|5.0|Coming from a wealthy family, I found the authors' findings so accurate.  I was born and raised in Asia, but moved to the US many years ago. My father --back in my home country--is a highly successful businessman. He  has very little education due to  limited resources; however, he built his  own business (from the ground up), where everyone in our family works for.  It's so amazing that what the authors found as characteristics of the rich  in the US also apply to those in the opposite side of the world. Everyone  in my family is frugal, very frugal. When I was a kid, I was always taught  to save, save and save. My parents did not buy luxuries. I never realized  how much of their lifestyle and esp. their attitudes toward money I  absorbed from them until I grew up and looked back. Since I was a kid,  people always said I was frugal (with a sneering tone).  I can confirm one  rule that was mentioned in the book as how the rich raised their kids:  &quot;Never tell children that their parents are wealthy.&quot; I never  realized how affluent my family (or at least my  parents were) until I was  13 or 14 because we normally didn't even think about luxury and everyone  was always told not to spend too much and to take good care of one's  belongings so that they lasted for a long time. My father is very strict  and he instilled in all of us high discipline.  It is very true that  children of the affluent who rely on their parents' finances are  controlled.  The money does not come with no string attached. Actually it  comes with a thick tie on it. How accurate the statement, &quot;Nothing is  free.&quot; is applied esp. in this situation.<br />In all, I think the rich,  no matter what part of the world they came from, all share the same values  that make them rich. I truly enjoy reading The Millionaire Next Door. In  several ways it makes me more fully understand myself and my family.
0553573403|5.0|George R.R. Martin weaves a gritty realistic world wherein characters and events take on a vivid life in the readers imagination. I espescially love the way Martin continually surprises me. All too often I read supposedly acclaimed novels wherein the author keeps telegraphing the unfolding of the  plot to the reader. Not so, Martin! Time and again I was shocked by the  fate Martin had in store for characters he made me care about. This is  truly a novel to get lost in.... you won't want to put it down. One walk  through the eery crypts under Winterfell, or perhaps a drink with a certain  cunning yet misshapen dwarf, and you will be hooked on this series.
0767836286|3.0|this movie presents alot of interesting ideas. about how the fbi may make mistakes of judgement and why it is benifical for a goverment to quickly wrap up a bombing and to blame one man. for me this is the big appeal of  the film. the acting is pretty good overall. jeff bridges jumps from one  extreme to another but time robbins and joan cussak are very good. the  ending is what everyone is talking about. all i can say on that is to watch  it yourself. everyone veiws it differently and it is important to see it it  for yourself.
0790720434|5.0|When writing or directing a children's film, far too often people find it necessary to dumb down work in order to cater to a young audience. Fortunately this is not the case with The Secret Garden, a film in which  the story it presents is well crafted and intelligent, and appealing to  both young and old audiences. In many ways the production could have gone  dreadfully wrong. One can see where in the hands of a less talented writer  or director the story could have become melodramatic, overly sentimental,  or comical, yet The Secret Garden is a beautifully executed picture that  rings true as a result of its naturalistic storytelling. Much of this is  due to the credit of its fine cast. Frequently, child actors are employed  to act &quot;cute&quot; onscreen, but there is not a young actor in this  movie who does not give a performance of great depth. In fact, it can  easily be argued that each one of these children exhibit greater skill than  many adults currently working in the realm of cinema. But what is at the  heart of The Secret Garden is a beautiful lyrical story about love,  childhood, growth, and healing. There are moments in the film that are so  genuinely touching the viewer's heart almost stops. Such is the case of the  scene in which the bedridden Collin is escorted outside of his house and  his eyes open to see spread before him his mother's beautiful garden. No  line of dialogue is necessary, for the happiness and peace that appears on  Collin's face speakvolumes in regard to his character. The film's ending  emotion is so rich and moving that it is impossible for the filmgoer to sit  untouched. This story is an absolute delight, and should be a must for  everyone! 10/10
6300185249|5.0|I don't care what this movie is based on, or if it is an inferior attempt at that movie. I think this is worthy in its own right. <br />As a matter of fact, I have quite personal reasons for appreciating this film. Some twelve  years ago, we actually went through an experience just like this one. True  enough, we never had to buy the house froma lady who dissolved in a flood  of tears while explaining how you know someone for twenty five years... And  then the Israeli secret service arrive.. It wasn't exactly like that. What  happened to us was that the house was discovered to have had dry rot - in  England this is the worst of bad news. Hanks discovers not just this, but  an impossible multiplication of similar things. Impossible - no. Once you  have experienced anything like this, you know just how terribly easy it all  is to slide into the money pit. (&quot;Mozart is dead, his troubles are  over, help ME!&quot;)<br />The character who is the conductor is completely  plausible (I know exactly who the real life character is), and the  characters who come to fix the house are.. priceless.<br />If you don't  believe this can really happen, you go, have two kids, find a house in  Farnborough and invite fate. In our case, the contractors didn't quite have  the style of the one's in the film (&quot;Quick. Write me a cheque before I  come to my senses&quot;). The ones I had to deal with, it must be said,  sadly, did not play Italian opera in their sports cars at 92 dB. <br />I love  the way this movie had of making my wife and I laugh ourseleves stupid. It  really helped us cope with a humourless situation in real life, and I  salute Tom Hanks, who makes a fool of himself so well, and has probably  smoothed away so much real hurt in the real world. What a lovely man!<br />If  you need any more convincing, skip to the last bit, where Tom and his  beloved are regularly trading insults, being spied on by the builders, and  finally decide to split just when the house is complete...  If you want a  squishy soft ending, this is it.<br />Of course, the whole thing is manifestly  absurd, and bears no resemblence to real life.
B00003ETJQ|5.0|Unless you are either in a coma or are dead this movie will move you.  It brought me to tears the first time I saw it.  It shows you a side of civilization that is so beautiful and a side that is so rancid.  This movie  is a must see for people of all ages.

0767825411|5.0|This Movie rules. If you havent seen this, see it, because its a great family film and belive me the kids will love it. And everyone loves the Stay Puft MarshmellowMan, and slimer. It's about 3 scientists who get  kicked out of a university and go into buisness for themselves, and blah  blah blah, just take my word for it and watch the movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER MADE!STARTS WITH THE GREAT ONCE,FOLLOWED BY THE AWESOME EVEN FLOW,THEN THE EPIC ALIVE,THEN A FAST PACED WHY GO,THEN THE HEARTFULL BLACK,THEN THEY GO ON TO THEIR BIGGEST US  HIT JEREMY,THEN THE AWESOME SONG OCEANS,THEN IT GOSE TO THE BEST SONG ON  THE CD AND PROBABLY EVER PorcH,THEN THE SLOW BUT GREAT GARDEN,THEN COMES  THE WEIRD AND WILD DEEP,THEN THEY FINISH IT OFF WITH THE RYTHMIC SOUND OF  RELEASE.I MEAN WHAT ELSE COULD YOU ASK FOR HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU LISTEN  TO A CD AND YOU LOVED EVERY SONG?WELL WITH PEARL JAM IT HAPPENS EVERY  TIME,WELL IN MY OPINION ANYWAYS.
B000007ODM|4.0|This is an exciting recording, because it is so different. It blends the traditional with something akin to Gregorian Chant in a modern context. It has a gutteral feel to it and ones response is immediate.
B00000F1D3|5.0|She's a key player in the generation that created the &quot;cool&quot;  kids today think is their own. She's done it all along the way and always stayed right on top of what was hot...whether what was &quot;hot&quot; was  new or not. Limited voice? Plastic bodied? Too old?  I bought my first Cher  song in 1965 and my most current in 2000. She sounds as powerful and fun as  she did 35 years ago. Let's see how many of you are still buying Celine and  Fastball and any Britney NEW RELEASES in 2035. Take a look at any photos of  Sonny and Cher circa 1966 and tell me what cool looks like in 2000. To  trash this incredible force as dated is like calling electricity a quaint  idea. Like any great artist, she owes us nothing but gives us her all  anyway.Thanks for this latest gift Cher!
B000006OBQ|5.0|Which is where you'll feel like you're sitting watching Francis Albert in his prime, struttin' his stuff in Vegas circa 1966.  This was definitely his town.  But forget about the image, this is a collection of great songs  that capture the essence of a generation, a way of thinking that is since  long gone.  Frank, with all of his devil-may-care attitude delivers these  songs with such style and swagger that it is hard not to conjure up images  of all the Vegas hijinks of the Rat Pack.  From the time Bobby Goulet  introduces the &quot;Man and His Music&quot; and as Count Basie's band  rolls out with all the subtlety of an avalanche you are about to be  transported.  Listen to the camaraderie between Frank and the Count as they  frolic through &quot;I've Got A Crush On You&quot; or the fervent pace of  &quot;Get Me To The Church&quot;  with Sinatra himself getting lost in the  moment repeating &quot;ding-dong, ding-dong ding-dong&quot; after the music  stops then telling his audience &quot;I think I made the point!&quot;.   You'll hear the consummate performer working his audience through the  high's and low's of the show and taking them at his pace.  As for the  monologue, which is in excess of 10 minutes, hey, what the hell, it's  Frank.  This is a great disc for anyone to have and a must for any Sinatra  fan.  Black Tie (Optional).
6305165912|5.0|I loved every line, every actor, every moment in this film!  John Goodman's Walter character had me rolling on the floor! I am becoming a big fan of the Coen Brother's work after seeing &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;,  &quot;Fargo&quot; and now this one! I recommend this one highly! But beware  if you are one of those weaklings who turn green whenever your virgin ears  hear a curse word or two.
B0000027RL|5.0|The first album for the band sounds in a perfect way. For me this is the best from Pearl Jam.
0964385619|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone over the age of 15.  I wish that I would have had this information, strategy and approach to $$ back them....no time like the present to change.<br />Reading this well written  book has change how I look at $.  As a result of reading this book I have  developed a solid strategy and now feel that I'm well on the way to  escaping the rat race.<br />Thank you Robert for writing this book and sharing  your knowledge with the rest of us.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Let me tell you, Significant Other has some great songs on it. From the slow rock songs like &quot;re-arranged&quot;, to &quot;no sex&quot;, &quot;nobody like you&quot;, &quot;don't go off wandering&quot;. Then you  got some great mosh pit songs like &quot;nookie&quot;, &quot;break  stuff&quot;, &quot;I'm broke&quot; &quot;show me what you got&quot;. And  some other great songs like &quot;just like this&quot;, &quot;I'm  broke&quot; &quot;a lesson learned&quot;, and &quot;9 teen 90 nine&quot;   Overall Limp Bizkit is pretty good. They're not as good as Metallica, or  The Smashing Pumkins, but they're still pretty good. The only problem with  Limp Bizkit is when they SELL OUT. Like putting the song &quot;nookie&quot;  on the NOW 3 CD with other bands like The Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears,  and such...  Other than that Limp Bizkit's pretty good.    Have a nice day!
B00002E23H|3.0|Scientists experiment on increasing the brain size of sharks in the hope of extracting a substance that will help cure Alzheimer's disease; but the experiment has a nasty side effect:  it creates &quot;smart sharks&quot;  who know they are being experimented on (I assume), break loose, and then  take no prisoners!  Some genuine jolts, as when Samuel Jackson's character  becomes fish food. <br />This movie is not JAWS, relying more on graphic  violence and spectacular special effects than genuine suspense build-up,  and it has other faults which I won't repeat in detail because other  reviewers have described them more than adequately (how do those massive  sharks get through those tiny doors, anyway?).  The blood, severed limbs,  etc., spill sufficiently freely that I can't recommend this to anyone with  a weak stomach--and I don't see how shark attacks four, five, six and seven  add that much to what happened with attacks one, two, and three.  <br />But  there is something going on here which justifies our not just dismissing  this as one more bad gorefest.  Our moviemakers are continuing to serve up  variants on Frankenstein's monster, one of the most powerful and longest  running tendencies in the science fiction of the last century.  Think about  it.  Humans try out some half-baked, poorly thought out bit of  technological gimmickry involving tampering with life--under the assumption  that science and technology can &quot;fix&quot; everything--and then the  law of unintended consequences takes over.  Once you overlook the flaws  (which aren't that obvious on the first viewing), you realize that what  makes this subgenre frightening is not the creatures but what they say  about us.  We don't have the control over Mother Nature that we think we  do. <br />So perhaps the JAWS comparison is a little misguided.  Not a perfect  movie by any means (hence the three stars), but worth checking out if  you've a strong enough stomach.  (Radically shortened and cleaned up, it  would have made a good OUTER LIMITS episode.)<br />On a lighter note, fans of  LL Cool J won't go away disappointed! The Preacher does rock!
0140434259|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them.  Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to  experience every word.  Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to  re-read it again.  It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking  in todays books.  Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart  woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but  became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and  Elinor.  Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays  love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love  you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection.
B000005EJL|3.0|Maybe rather than expecting &quot;Take The Long Way Home: Revisted&quot;, it should be remembered that only one of the two former leaders is still around--the guy who wrote and sang &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;. Rick  Davies is more in the mode of Walter Becker than his former partner Roger  Hodgson. The marvel of the old Supertramp was that two such men could work  together at all. Meanwhile, while Davies isn't doing &quot;real  Supertramp&quot;, what he is doing might well be just as important. Steely  Dan and the Doobie Brothers are no more, and their former leadership aren't  exactly flooding us with stuff. Donald Fagen has done just two albums in  more than a decade, Becker just one, and Michael McDonald is into soft rock  these days. Anyone who feels that this disc doesn't belong on the same  shelf as &quot;Breakfast In America&quot;--hey, move it to where you keep  &quot;Katy Lied&quot; and &quot;Aja&quot;. Think of this album in terms of  what it is instead of what it isn't.
B000002OG5|5.0|very solid disc.the music captures the many complex moments of the film.it brings so much more texture to the film.this is one of the few films ever made that you can watch the film and listen to the music at the same  time.pure genius.
B00003XB8K|2.0|I have enjoyed all the previous enigma albums thus far, except this one.  It is both 'unoriginal' and recycled music, which has lead me to believe that maybe enigma has gotten lazy in their old age.
B000002H97|5.0|I first heared some songs off this album with friends and when I went out and bought it, I have never regretted it. I would recemmend this album to be the first of your Metallica's collection, since I know you will just  have to buy all of their albums after hearing this one.  This is a good  album just before they came out with Load and went from  the &quot; old  Metallica&quot; to the &quot;new Metallica&quot;. I would get this album  first and just keep on listening to the thrashing drumns of Lars, the deep  voice of James and the giutars. Definitly go buy it, now.
0446310786|5.0|Scout is just a normal girl living in a sleepy southern town, until her lawyer father takes the case of a black man accused of rape, and her life is thrown into turmoil. Compassionate and exiting, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird explores human behavior; kindness and cruelty, innocence and  guilt, love and hatred, humor and sorrow. This novel gave me a better  insight to prejudice and life in the south during that era, and left a  lasting impact I will never forget.
0385484518|4.0|Liked this book, but I enjoyed more a book called: PERAMBULATIONS by CS BACK. PERAMBULATIONS was more down to Earth and honest....Spiritual too!
B000002P5R|5.0|I love this record.  Despite the songs being in various stages of completion, many of these tracks are brilliant.  Freedom, Ezy Rider, and Dolly Dagger are a few of the standouts.<br />I'm a guitar player and let me  just point out that Jimi was using multi-tracking techniques that were far  beyond most of his contemporaries.  His playing and ideas were so much more  advanced than any 60's rocker.  Many of the more completed songs feature  some interesting harmonies with several guitars. Just check out Ezy  Rider.<br />If you read the liner notes carefully, many of the tunes that  simply started out as 12 bar blues jams morphed into songs with completely  different rhythm structures and chord changes.  Jimi was a very hard  working musician, pushing his as well as popular music's boundaries.  These  tracks, along with his other albums, prove that this was  a musician who  was continuing to evolve his playing style.  He was only getting better!  Most players are still trying to catch up with<br />this talented man 30 years  after he passed on.<br />This album is in constant rotation on my CD player.   It's funky, earthy, spiritual, rocking,  and downright kick booty.
B000009ED0|1.0|his lack of talent and trailor park metality make his work more fit for Jerry than for a musical challenge.he is talentless pure garbage the kind of stuff that is overly promoted today.what a true no-talent bum.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|hello!  would someone please keep this woman from singing!  do not buy this cd, the songs are so cheesey and the singing is so awful.  jennifer can't hold a note, has no range.  every song is sung in the same monotone  key.  but the worst part is when she tries to hit a high note.....my dog  sounds better than her.  in the future i won't buy anymore of her cd's.
B000005DQR|5.0|i was never aware that it was possible to create music with this much emotion without playing most of the instruments.  i am just listening to this for the first time, and i am blown away
068484267X|4.0|Delightfully rich memoir of Ireland......I just read a memoir called PERAMBULATIONS by CS BACK which reminded me of this book,,,,except PERAMBULATIONS is more descriptive and I could identify with it as an  American male.
0767802772|4.0|What are the critics thinking?  That's what I would like to know.  This was a great movie; no it wouldn't win any Oscars because of its simplicity, but sometimes the simpler things are the best.  What a great story line for  people with different cultures to view.  I would recommend this movie to  anyone who wants to see a good, romantic, funny movie.
B000002U82|5.0|The best way to describe this album is to say that Roger Waters and co.  managed to condense the universe into a record.  Turn this on, turn of the lights, and wisk away to the land of Pink Floyd.  You WILL find yourself in  a semi-consious state by the fourth song, and this album isn't even their  best (the WALL).  It just goes to show you what a band Pink Floyd was.   Even better than (dare I say) the beatles!
0394810112|4.0|Title: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory    Author: Roahl Dahl<br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a story about how Charlie and his grandfather get to go to the Chocolate Factory. The Chocolate Factory is made of Wonka Bars with a Golden Ticket inside. If you opened a candy bar and it had a Golden Ticket inside, you could go on a tour of the Chocolate Factory. Charlie really wanted to go on a tour of the Chocolate Factory. He bought  many candy bars. Charlie won the last Golden Ticket. Charlie is bringing  his Grandfather to the Chocolate Factory. I think this story is good  because they get to go float around in space and do all this cool stuff. I  also like this book because I like those little Umpa Lumpas because they  did some cool stuff on that island. I think this is the best book I have  ever read in my life. This book was very creative in some  ways.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is Marion Zimmer Bradley's tome of the Arthurian time as told through the women of the time.  It is also about the struggle of a people during a time of religious upheaval and change.  The author is able  to so entwine you into the happenings and entrance you with the characters,  it is hard to remember reality while reading.  This is fiction, but done so  well, you almost wish it were true.  Though the women are strong, they also  have weaknesses, making them all the more human and believable.  A  wonderful book for Pagans and a great read for anyone wanting a unique  point of view on the Arthurian legends.  I found it hard to put down and  long after I was finished, it lingered in my mind like some long forgotten  memory....touching the edges of my mind and making me see my own life  differently.  A very powerful book!
B000002N25|5.0|I still remember the day back in 1996 when I was driving my car and listening to the radio, when a new song started to play. From the very first guitar picks, I said to myself: &quot;That´s Mark Knopfler!&quot;.  The music was &quot;Don´t You Get It&quot;, one of the fourteen tracks  displayed in Golden Heart. His re-MARK-able style had done it again. I am a  big fan of Knopfler´s music, from the early Dire Straits songs to his  brilliant solo works, but this is not a album only for his fans - it is for  all who love music. Four years on and it´s still hard to say which is the  best song of it !<br />Say no more, my best ever album.
0684874350|5.0|I am usually a mystery/thriller reader but this one caught my eye.  Once I started reading it, though, I thought this was a really depressing book.  I kept on reading, and thinking what I would do if I was so desperate. And I kept on reading.  I continued to think how horrible it must have been to  live in such poverty and ignorance and though the book was really making me  feel sad, I had to keep on reading.  It is a testimony to the human spirit  and to know that no matter what the odds, a person can make it.  I am  starting the sequel &quot;Tis&quot; tonight.  I applaud Mr Frank McCourt  for this wonderful, albeit sad, story.  I can't wait to start  &quot;Tis&quot;.
1559408758|4.0|Spinal Tap is a certified cult classic. like the Blues Brothers, Animal House, etc. Comedies like these can never die and it is foolish for the movie to be unavailable to consumers.
0671578278|5.0|This book was a wonderful follow-up to Komarr.  Miles' character continues to develop, as do the other characters.  I was very pleasantly suprised by the humor, and stayed up far later than I should have reading it, trying to  muffle my laughter so as not to wake anyone else up.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|I'm a Hong Kong Chinese, this story is one of the best. (it's a required text in Chinese language course for all Form 3 students here). Disney does a good job in bring this to the screen. However, I must say in general the  drawing of Mulan pale in comparison with Prince of Egypt, Anatasia. it's  just too 2-D. I think Disney must work harder before its position in  cartoon making get replaced.
B000002MTU|5.0|I still remember back in 1996 when I bought this album and put it in my cd player: I was really angry... because from track 10 on the CD was damaged and I couldn´t play it till the end. It took me some days to get another  disc and go on listening to the others tracks of this wonderful album. Oh,  and with exception of two of the sixteen tracks, it´s a live recording,  without overdubs - Great!<br />Clapton plays Dixon, Muddy, Carr, Boyd, Freddy,  among others - It´s a fine tribute to some who set a way for the blues. As  a fan of Clapton and a fan of the blues, that´s an essential recording.
B00000AFGM|4.0|Elvis is Dead; Run DMC are past their prime; so all hail to Brian Warner, aka Marilyn Manson, aka Mr. Depravity, aka The King (and Queen) of Rock at this, the beginning of a new millenium.<br />Seriously, this is one terrificly  entertaining record by one of rock's most interesting people. Here, Manson  cops an early 70s, glam vibe and makes it all his own, using it to fuel  some very well crafted, hook filled, songs. The outrages and shock values,  as well as the sick humor, of his earlier records are there, but here the  alienation is a bit tempered by a more relaxed overall tone.<br />Anyway,  just listen to a tune like &quot;The Dope Show&quot; or &quot;New  Model,&quot; and if they doesn't give you a bit of a buzz, or get you  dancing around the room, you probably shouldn't call yourself a rock and  roll fan.
B0000021RB|5.0|This is my first Chicago CD and I believe it is by far my most favorite. The horn line's funky licks accentuate the rest of the band's smooth grooves - all coming together into great music that you can't help but bob  your head to... Enchanting Wizard of Rhythm gives it an A+.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the most awesome movie ever.  Unbelievable effects and fabulous storyline.  It was a workout for my brain!
0679745203|5.0|To be absolutely honest, I read &quot;The English Patient&quot; about two years before the film came out and swept the awards.  Had I not read the book, I would have liked the movie just the same (after all, it is a pretty  awesome movie).  Both the book and the movie enhances and deepens the  meaning of the other, in a way.  Michael Ondaatje's prose is vague and  harrowing, yet when all becomes clear, the words are like deep gashes on  clear glass.  It does not seem to have much of a plot, but it's the way he  adds emotion, reason, and consequence to it that makes it so gripping.  The  movie is this poetry on screen, but it simplifies the characters and the  plot in order to get through to us (if it were exactly the same as the  book, we'd probably have no idea what they were talking about), and it  works.  Both work brilliantly in its own way, but my personal preference  would be the book--its raw emotionalism and power always strikes me.
B000002J1I|4.0|Man, there's a lot of Tormato bashing going on. Let's open 'er up and see what's inside.<br />Future Times and Rejoice--a really great song. I agree with the person who extolled the thirty seconds (including the supposed  rip-off of Kashmir) between a) and b). The harmonized bass sounds great  throughout. A ton of restrained power on this song. Don't Kill the  Whale--the dud of the album. A really dated song. Madrigal--pleasant, with  a cool final thirty seconds between Howe and Wakeman. Release,  Release--cool intro, cool ending, dreary middle part. Arriving UFO--damn  all of you who don't like this song. Howe's guitar sound is the freakiest  thing he's come up with. Wakeman jams over Squire's steady 8's. This is a  really great, underrated song. Circus of Heaven--Another wrongly-bashed  song. Anderson is in great voice, and the words are cool. The slow-down  part before &quot;Ouside great animals&quot; thru the end is very subtle;  the very simple rising synth line before the fade out chords is sublime.  Onward--I think I am alone in saying that this one is way overrated. I  can't make it thru without skipping to the next song, which is... On the  Silent Wings of Freedom--what a great opening, really restrained. Dig the  cool up-down sliding bass just before the lyric enters. The big mistake  happens at the questionably abrupt change just before &quot;Where we are  coming from&quot;...who's idea was that? But the song recovers shortly, and  the final thirty seconds are bizarre in a cool way, the ending  snappy.<br />The recording quality is a real bummer. I wish they'd dredge up  the tapes and have another go at it. Anyway, I've heard Starship Troopers  so many times I can't stand it. It's nice to listen (and relisten, a lot)  to a diverse, creative, and often funky Yes album like Tormato.<br />Who cares  what the cover looks like?
0679416781|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time, even though I found it frustrating the first time through.  I kept wondering &quot;where are we now?  what's going on?&quot; and re-reading passages to pick up the thread of the plot.  The second time through, with a grasp of where the book was  headed, I was able to enjoy the sheer beauty of the book's mood and  atmosphere.  I would advise first time readers to savor the book, and not  worry about the sense of drifting among plot lines - the book will take you  with it.  I have noticed in conversations with people about &quot;The  English Patient&quot; that there are those who like the book, and those who  like the movie.  The movie has a much more traditional narrative flow.  It  took two readings for me to understand that the book has to be read like  poetry.
B000031XCR|5.0|I loved the album so much that I couldn't stop listening to it!  I hope when Celine comes back her new album will be great also.
0441172717|5.0|In short:  An amazing and timeless book, still as wonderful today as it was when first published.  Everyone should read this book.
B00003XB8K|5.0|From start to finish Cretu has again matched and exceeded my expectations.  This work is a soundtrack to an unknown myth told in distant dreams.  His ever growing palate of exotic sounds has again broken upon the edges of a  bold curiosity and fused across 11 tracks where he masks heavily the  sources of intrigue that have given those of us that have come to  appreciate his work another reason to desire and obtain it.  Screen Behind  the Mirror is excellent.  Much to my surprise, Cretu worked &quot;O  Fortuna&quot; into his mixtures giving the entire CD a powerful backbone.   Even for those few who are visually particular about an album's full design  won't be let down.  The cover is an appropriate derision of the work: the  image of a woman wearing a mask that pulls us into the awareness of a  distant place, the harshness of beauty and the sorrows that capture us.   Overall this entire project is a valuable addition to his ongoing works of  meditative rhythm.  It is another escape altogether.
6303575617|5.0|I enjoyed the video greatly. Cory shows you how to lift weights the right way to keep your form when doing lifts. She explains everything in a straight forward easy way. This video would be great for anyone starting  and not knowing the first thing about proper weight training. I would  recommed this to any woman no matter what age. I'm 47 weight training  made  me stronger and it didnt hurt my golf game either.
0385484518|4.0|I usually eschew &quot;inspirational&quot; best-sellers, but  I read this one because I have a beloved relative with ALS and wanted to understand what she's going through.  The deepening relationship between the two men  as Morrie's condition worsens is touching, as is the transformation in  Mitch's consciousness.  However, I felt the book was nowhere near the  &quot;complete Morrie&quot;:  being a consummate teacher, he set Mitch a  limited assignment that he knew he could handle, but the deeper thinking  behind Morrie's aphorisms remains unsaid.  It's a good story (about Mitch),  well written, and worth reading, but I'm looking forward to &quot;Morrie in  His Own Words&quot; for what Morrie was really about.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I've been hooked since the first day I brought my copy of &quot;Piano Man&quot; home from the record store. Since then I've watched him mature into the talented performer that he has become. This two disc set defines a  great portion of his career, from his self proclaimed stories to his tounge  in cheeck pop classics. If you've been a fan as long as I have you've  probably got all the vinyl too, but you'll appreciate Billy's music much  more once you experience it on these discs, no excuses, get out there and  pick this up!
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is an extremely well recorded album by the chili peppers.  The guitar work and the vocals are great!  EVERY song on this CD is very fun to listen to.  I highly recommend this album to anyone that wants a good rock album.
0385255853|5.0|I have found these books to be wonderful stories! I was hooked when I first opened &quot;Outlander.&quot; I find Claire's modern day sense of humor in rather barbaric (to her way of thinking) situations refreshing, as well as her intelligence. How many other authors would have thought to have her bring penicillin to the 18th century, or better still, try to invent it in the 18th century? Jamie is, what can I say, completely wonderful. Stubborn, yes, macho, true, yet lovable and so compatible with Claire.<BR>I couldn't put any of these books down once I had started them. I have them all in hardback and prominently displayed on my bookshelf with the &quot;Outlandish Companion.&quot; I even persuaded my grandmother to read them, and she loved them!<BR>I have to wholeheartedly recommend these books to any reader of historical fiction. You really feel like these characters could have existed, and that you are actually looking at life much the way it was in the 18th century. Keep up the good work, Ms. Gabaldon; I am eagerly awaiting the next book(s) in the series!
B000002KCV|3.0|I bought this CD on recommendation from a big Neil Young fan.I was told that this was his best album so I had to give it a try. Infact although there are some good songs on it (namely comes a time and look out for my  love) , the class of Old Man, Harvest, I believe in you (just to name a  few) isn't there. If this had been his first album I would probably have  rated it higher but I suppose following Goldrush and Harvest is impossible.
0833500651|5.0|After reading about 1/2 of the 170+ comments on this book i see two types, those who soaked in Pirsig's point of view, and those who read it specifically for the philosophical (or is it psychological) worth. The former were tromendously satisfied and the latter were not so. <br />      After reading the book two and a half times (first as required reading in a  Psychology course) i felt it necissary to expound my views on it. The first  time through i was reading for content and answers for quiz material - i  truly missed the spirit of the book, the underlying truth that was  presented by a confused and enlightened man. Once the pressure was over, i  read it as Phaedrus would have - line by line. I started mulling over the  unknowns and unanswerables that were presented and i found that the voice  of the book was the voice of my proverbial soul - i had believed what the  book presented before i read it which is just as confusing and bewildering  as my mind and the world. It made me understand that truth is not always  rational, what is rational is not always right, and what is right not  always the truth. <br />    The crux, I believe, is that this book is meant  for those who are seeking something more, and those who are forced into  reading it, or read it merely because it was suggested will not truly get  out of it what is intended - a bit of enlightenment that proves how  unenlightened our world and ourselves are.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I have been a director of classical orchestra for nearly 55 years now here in Eastern Europe, and I must say that in all my years and all the experiments in fusion I have seen, I have never heard anything quite like  this.  Heavy metal is not me, mind you.  I have never liked it generally  and I never will.  However, James Hetfield along with the rest of the  members of Metallica and the San Francisco Orchestra pulled off a haunting  display of melody, harmony, strings, and metal.  It is the only  &quot;metal&quot; CD I own.  To all music lovers out there, I'm 78 years  old and I have recently found myself reciting lyrics, along with harmonies,  of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;The Things that Should Not  Be&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.  Not all old men are  crazy.  Just some are Metallica fans, that's all.
6301963717|5.0|Why does it seem that EVERY actor in this movie was absolutely brilliant in playing their parts?  Normally, you only see 2 or 3 or at most a handful of brilliant actors that stand out in any one movie.  Is it because the  movie had such a great script?  Is it because the directors did such a good  job?  etc.  etc...  or is it because all the actors really excelled in  their acting ability in this movie?  I can't tell.
B000005RHR|5.0|This collection of tracks from the early stages of Richard James's career and experiments fits not exactly into the sphere of 'ambient', as in Brian Eno, but 'ambient techno'. And in there, this release is one of the  defining documents. Essential. Lush atmospherics + beats dominate here, and  provide an experience that's as welcome in a chill-space as in one's own  headphones. There are no duff tracks on this one, although those expecting  the harder RDJ sound (see Caustic Window, or much of the recent Aphex  material) probably will get thrown somewhat by the inviting feel of this  album. But I doubt they'll be disappointed, honestly. My only regret here  is that James doesn't pay much attention to this musical territory these  days; his current work could benefit from revisiting these efforts, I  think.
B000002GOZ|5.0|this album, by far has got to bethe best.  Ifound it very emotional at times as the music was so beautiful especially in I'm ready.  The Irish flute was a brilliant concept and the listening to him live just really  makes you wonder in awe and think this is what real music is.  I was  impressed at how he played the songs in differnt way shedding a different  light and conveying more intimate emotions with each song.  This artist is  certainly one to see live as it is well worth it as the atmosphere and live  pwerformance is catched perfectly on this album.  Defintly well worth  buying.
B000005S37|5.0|Music is not always pretty. This certainly isn't. Done partly as a way to get revenge on RCA for botching his marketing, &quot;MMM&quot; actually derives from goings-on in the NYC art scene that paralleled the beginning  of the Velvet Underground, most notably the work of LaMonte Young and his  Theatre of Eternal Music. John Cale worked with Young in the early 60s, and  many of the performances done with this group were also a dense,  impenetrable, loud harmonic din. Cale later brought many ideas from this  ensemble into the Velvets, and this is where Reed definitely ran into them.  For those who just know rock, this release is an unlistenable mess. But if  your horizons extend into industrial, experimental, electroacoustic, and/or  New Music, &quot;MMM&quot; makes perfect sense and is a seminally-important  recording. It predates the 'beginning' of industrial music, supposedly by  Throbbing Gristle in the UK, by a year or so, and the sound which Reed puts  across here definitely became part of that vocabulary. And anyone who's  heard Sonic Youth at their most experimental, or the work of Glenn Branca  or Rhys Chatham, will pick up the connections here. Yes...it _is_ ugly  noise, spread across a whole CD (or originally, 2 LPs, with a lock-groove  at the very end...but it is _very important_ ugly noise.
B000031EGV|1.0|Movie is fine BUT DVD says Dolby 5.1 there is no rear channel information... May be great on VHS but not worth it for a good home theather setup.
B000002HIK|3.0|This release is the first full-length followup after the slagging Richard James got from some sectors of the rave scene for his brilliant 'Selected Ambient Works II'. And as such, it feels unfocussed, the tracks often lead  nowhere, and a good bit of the atmosphere here is designed (seemingly) to  annoy, particularly the high-pitched tone throughout 'Ventolin'. Only 'Icct  Hedral' and 'Alberto Balsam' really connected with me; the rest of what's  here seems merely tossed together, belying a certain tone of sarcasm and  cynicism hiding behind both the album's title and the leering, grinning  illo of RDJ on the cover. There's better out there...
B00000JCB2|3.0|OK, I understand we all have bills to pay but come on.  This CD has a couple good songs which are the real Limp Bizkit.  Other than that, MTV did a number on these guys which one might refer to as &quot;Selling Out  Big&quot;.  Like I said, I understand the financial burden of playing for  small clubs, but don't sell out, then try to act so suprised by the  reaction from your &quot;real fans&quot;.
B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed's never been one to deal with the easy issues, to be sure. But on &quot;Berlin&quot;, Lou opens up emotional wounds that pain the psyche just as deeply as the similarly-difficult &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;  assaults the ears. But where &quot;MMM&quot; is just an assault on ones'  hearing, this release assaults your soul. Trent Reznor thinks he's dark.  The darkness of Lou Reed's &quot;Berlin&quot; makes him sound like Barry  Manilow, while engaging in none of the aural histrionics we associate with  'dark' these days. Like Bertold Brecht at his peak, grappling with the  moral decay and degradation of the human spirit, this record tears at you  in ways you never knew you could be torn. Keep the lithium handy...
B000002BUY|5.0|i bought this cd and it is cool. the two songs that i like the most are redefine and idiot box. buy this cd if you like jimmie's chicken shack or orange 9mm.
0452273331|4.0|Amazing how most reviews either award five or one star.  Its been five years since I read The Fountainhead as a senior in high school.  Like many other impressionable youths, I was lured hook-line-and-sinker into her  simplistic world of Roarks and Keatings.  Of course, her philosophy, in its  uncompromising form, is unworkable (indeed undesirable) in the real world.   But that by no means suggests that we should discard it entirely. Rand has  a lot to say about the strength and nobility of the human spirit and the  independence of the human mind.  The world would be a better (and more  interesting) place were more people to follow some of her initiatives.  Of  course, her novel was meant as thinly-veiled philosophical propaganda.  For  that very reason, it is presented as black-and-white, like a checklist of  rules for a happy life.  To follow her philosophy blindly would be silly  and immature.  Philosophy exists only in the human mind.  When one tries to  apply it to real life, the smart person will always do so with a grain of  salt. <br />When it comes down to it, Rand wrote an important book, developed  original characters, and a told strong, compelling story.  Whether or not  one agrees with her philosophy, these are good enough reasons to award it  at least four stars.
B00000099Y|1.0|I am an avid fan of the hardcore music genre and though i usually stay away from Cd's with explicit lyrics, everyone told me to give this a try cause it was &quot;a wonderful and beautiful piece of hardcore music.&quot;   I am not impressed in the least.  What I found was music so watered-down  and sterile that it had to be saturated with profanity to create the shock  and turn the heads that the sloppy guitar riffs and drumming that would  make AC/DC look like jazz fusion would not.  It makes me sick that the mass  market embraces such an utter lack of musical ability and profanity.  If  this band only made an album every 5 years, like they have been, I would  not be upset in the least.  Pass this one up and spend your time reading or  listening to real music.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is one of the best cds I've gotten.  Savage Garden is one of my favorite groups and I love ALL the songs.  I've seen the music video for the song, I KNEW I LOVED YOU  and Darren is CUTE!   So just don't sit  there, go out and buy this cd.  You'll regret it if you don't.
0767802659|1.0|I have never seen a major film with worse acting. Denise Richards is another Hollywood tart with no talent. The lead actor Casper Von Airhead another no talent. What is there to reccomend? Cool bugs

B00000K19E|5.0|This DVD is genious.  To get to watch this movie in three different ways is awesome.  First watch it normally.  Then follow the white rabbit and probably the most ingenious thing is to watch the movie with only the sound  track. WOW!  The only thing missing is a version that fits normal tv  screens.  It only plays in the widescreen format.
B000023VTQ|5.0|In a scene in which mega-star Anna Scott (Roberts) shows up at her date's family function, one guest, upon being introduced, gushes that she had always thought that she and Anna could be best friends. It occurred to me  that -- probably -- a lot of people say something similar to Julia Roberts.  Her screen persona is so engaging that one can imagine a relationship  between her and &quot;ordinary&quot; folks.<br />But this movie is also a Hugh  Grant vehicle and he holds it together well, from start to finish.       <br />Not to be overlooked is the wonderful group of wacky friends. Rather  like the group in Four Weddings and a Funeral, each makes a unique  contribution to the story.  <br />Charming and delightful. Really.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Bought it. Love it. Thundercrack is a lost gem. Some of the music is messy and unpolished and that's it's charm. If you love Bruce, really love the guy's music, you'll excuse the naysayers for not &quot;getting it.&quot;  Any real fan will accept this on all terms. Wish now I had purchased it the  day it came out. &quot;Let's go!&quot;
0679777547|3.0|I started out loving this book.  It had intrique, interesting characters, exciting locations, and a promising plot.  I even enjoyed the literary references.  Somewhere near the middle of the book I began to tire of it  all.  Yes, you can feel very clever when you know all the references.   Nonetheless, I still think that a book has to have a compelling plot to  deserve more than three stars.  This book started with a lot of potential  and ended as just an average book.
0553296981|4.0|Title-The Diary of Anne Frank Author-Anne Frank<br />  I liked this book because it was interesting.  This book was about Anne living in a warehouse almost all her life, which would be 13 years. She had one sister named Margaret.  My favorite part in this book is when the cat was there and  they were hiding out and, the cat made a noise while someone was down  stairs and they all got scared and froze.  My least favorite part was in  the beginning when they were just talking and getting to know each other.  I would recommend this book to kids 4th grade and up, because you can  learn a lot about the holocaust and what Jewish people went through during  this time.  Jessica Knight
6304765789|5.0|The Game is one of the most watched video I watch.  I pratically have it memorized.  I think the plots and twist are great.  I wish there was a real CRS.  Micheal Douglas plays Nicholas Van Orten very good and dynamic.  The  way it end is interesting when Christine ask him he wants to join her for  coffee at the airport he looks around him and it ends.
0140072187|5.0|I first read this book while in the Army in 1984, serving as an Air Traffic Controller.  It was surreal to read such a riveting account of Viet Nam while occasionally hearing Huey Helecopters flying around the area.  It is true to form for the Army experience.  Mason's explinations of how  helecopters' fly and the tactics he was taugh are excellent.  I have read  this book 5 or 6 times now.  It will make you laugh and it will cause you  to reflect.  It will also give you a sense of what it must have been like  in Viet Nam during the war.  It did so for me.  I have the upmost respect  for Mr. Mason.  His follow-up book, Chickenhawk II is excellent also and  begins where the first one leaves off.
B000002U9W|5.0|Do you love Pink Floyd? Tired of turning on the radio and hearing the same old stuff from them? You know, The Wall, Dark Side of the moon and Wish you Were Here? Well, you are in for a treat. Sit back relax and enjoy that  which is Atom Heart Mother. No, it is not radio friendly, no it is not  mainstream. But what it IS is mind blowing thought provoking rock at its  best and most creative. The opening, Atom heart mother,is brilliant with  it's orchestration and over dubs, and all the way through to the end and  Alan's Psychedelic breakfast the album fuses one extreme to the other.  True, it MAY take more than one listening to to get into what the album is  about and to appreciate what Floyd was doing, but when you do get 'into' it  you will not turn back. No, breast milky and funky dung will never be heard  on the radio, but all the better for us who are sick of The Wall and DSOTM.  See, unfortunately this album was eclipsed by the great sucess of Darkside.  Ah, such is fate.
0440234743|5.0|John Grisham picks you up and takes you with him on this spellbinding trip.  A fantasy trip into vast wealth, greed, human transformation, spiritualism, fear and grief. I didn't want it to end. Another winner for  John Grisham!
0385491026|5.0|I feel old knowing that Cat's Eye is required reading for high school students and a bit jealous. This is my favorite novel. What cinches it for me is not the story &quot;line,&quot; but the careful choice of words, and use of metaphor. Few get it so right. I am pleased as punch over and over  reading what comes forth from Margaret Atwood's deft brain. Example: During  one Thanksgiving dinner the young
0553210246|1.0|&quot;The Story of a Man of Character&quot; as described by Thomas Hardy is somewhat flaccidly applied to this novel.  In fact, a better description of this novel comes from a colleague of mine, Professor Neale Scott of the  Baltimore University, who remarked &quot;I realise now I had mistaken the  dullness of Henchard's character for the dullness of the whole  novel.&quot;. Ultimately, Prof. Scott is quite accurate in his assessment  of the text.  The characters bumble around, waiting for circumstance to  attach itself to their groins, and do very little of plausible importance  at all.  Henchard himself is, without doubt, one of the most irritating  characters to be placed in 'classic' fiction, and one can't help but wish  that the death of our tragic hero had happened an awful lot sooner, such as  before the novel started. The character of Elizabeth-Jane, wonderfully  parodied by Helli Kitchin, of the Moscow State University, is so blase  towards her constantly changing parenthood that it completely ruins any  sense of empathy that the audience may have for her.  The least convincing  Scotsman ever can also be found in this text, in the form of Donald  Farfrae, and I am inclined to agree with Dr Daniel Greenfeld, whose thesis,  &quot;Hardy makes the heart grow colder&quot;, points out that the author  would not know a Scotsman if one jumped up and bit him, a way that most of  us admittedly meet them. To sum up - I discourage my students from reading  this shambolic text.  Avoid this novel like the plague - it is so soggy,  you couldn't even burn it to stay warm.  Attempt, perhaps, to read  something a little more plausible with something other that a praetorian  wanderer and an intransigent hay-trusser to tantalise the imagination,  something that the author was obviously lacking - Wessex indeed.

I am pleased as punch over and over  reading what comes forth from Margaret Atwood's deft brain. Example: During  one Thanksgiving dinner the young Elaine is watching and listening to an  adult conversation concerning the turkey's ability to fly having been bred  out of it's body in favour of easier containment issues and larger, jucier  portions of meat. It occurs to Elaine that she is &quot;eating lost  flight.&quot; If that kind of realization doesn't appeal to you, as  metaphor, you might not like this novel.
B00000JZC4|5.0|After &quot;Hey Man Nice Shot&quot; came out and faded away, I was afraid that we'd never hear from Filter again. Luckily, I was wrong. Four years later, they've come out with an album that's every bit as good as you could  hope it would be. <br />Richard Patrick's vocals are just as wrenching and  delightfully gravelly as they were last time around; he goes from his  trademark screech to a sweet little croon in the space of a few seconds in  &quot;Sand.&quot; And &quot;Miss Blue&quot; is FANTASTIC. Any girl who's  ever dumped somebody or anybody who's ever been dumped by a girl will be  able to identify with this song.<br />I bought this album a week ago and I've  probably listened to it all the way through at least three times every day  since. HIGHLY recommended.
0790736918|5.0|So much has been written about &quot;The Searchers&quot; over the last 25 years or so (since it was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by the film community) that writing any more praises almost sounds like empty babbling.  My only  suggestion to those who have seen it only once, whether they liked it or  not, is to see it again--and again.  This is an extraordinarily complex  film, and with repeated viewing more and more reveals itself to the modern  viewer who is often unaccustomed to visual storytelling by a master like  John Ford, who did his screenwriting with the camera.  I say this in  particular for people like the gentleman who wrote previously saying that  he did not see any of the characters change during the film.  Especially  with respect to John Wayne's character, watch his actions, expressions and  movements in isolation from the words he says.  His character certainly  does change, enormously.  One only has to pay attention.
B000001E29|5.0|i have to admit that it took several listening to actually enjoy this cd, but such effort was well rewarded.  more and more i listened to the album, it becomes more and more amazing.  tom is a hopeless romantic covered in  strange sounds and low fidelity.  however, because of the ugly cover, the  gem inside shines much more bright.  for example, the screeching sound of  saw-violin on &quot;November&quot; is very haunting(almost irritatingly so)  at the first few listenings, but after a while, a listener gets to hear  desperations, longing, yearning and much more in it, in the most Romantic  way.
0395389496|5.0|I think this book is very nice. I think you should read it!
B000002GYG|5.0|i am a huge tom waits fan, and i love his late (weird) stuff as much as his early ones.  but, if i have to take only one tom waits cd to a deserted island, this would be it.   let's face it, tom is a very cheesy man.  for  example, lsiten to &quot;big joe and phantom 309.&quot;  the song  practically drips chees all over your stereo.  however, whenever i listen  to this song, tear drops gather up in my eyes.   lastly, what a band!  even  if tom were not part of this recording (although it would be a big  diminishment), the band alone would be worth listening to.
0679436391|5.0|I think this is one of the best books about Christmas. In this book Ebenezer Scrooge meets ghosts. These ghosts help to teach him about life. I would recommend this book to you.
0792842073|2.0|Because it's about death penalty, nun and savagery, it MUST make you think and it MUST be an intelligent movie ?  No way. Both characters are hateful and very badly defined (you don't actually know why the nun fancies Penn so  much and vice versa). Since the beginning of the movie, Sarandon's  character does nothing but laugh at all that Penn says while crying buckets  in front of the victims' parents. The ending is 300% American in its  exaggeration.
0679436391|5.0|I think this was a really good book because Scrooge met four ghosts. They were the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, Christmas Future, and his dead friend Jacob Marley. Mr. Scrooge is the main character of the  story. He is really mean! For example, when he was walking through town,  people would avoid him as much as possible. Even dogs would avoid him. As  Scrooge met the ghosts, one by one, he slowly saw his bad side and changed  his life forever (for the good). You should read this book every Christmas  to help you remember what Christmas is all about.
0385484518|5.0|I am reading Morrie finally after requesting it from Interlibrary Loan a long time ago!  It came to me finally - on a Tuesday!  I agree with the masses that it is a most wonderful book in it's simplicity!  What I found the most interesting and which also brought a smile to my face were the  negative responses!  There will always be someone to point out the weakest  link!  Always someone to bring you down!  Amazing!  This book has the most  simplest premise - Love - and still there are people that will fight it!  I  see how Jesus could have been brought down!  But you know - I found that  these very comments &quot;the book was so short&quot; or &quot;he's getting  rich off Morrie&quot; or &quot;it's so expensive&quot; or &quot;it's so  banal&quot; - very challenging remarks and exact a very passonate response  from me!  <br />You know I have been noticing lately that really how long does  it take for something to say that all that really counts is Love - but  maybe some people need for it to be said in a very complex way to be  believed and who cares where the money goes - did it touch your heart and  awaken your soul and make it nod - Yes!  But you know I didn't buy the book  - I got it from a library.  But now I am certain that I am going to buy it  and have it in my library at home and I am going to request it for the  college library where I work.  So everyone keep up all the various comments  - I get great passion either way no matter what is said 'cause all I really  hear is my heart =&gt;  What a great message - like I said - in it's  simplicity.
0679436391|5.0|This is a very creative story. I think Charles Dickens was trying to say, through this story, that Christmas is not a Bah Humbug. Everyone should be kind to each other. This is my favorite Christmas story.
0671576089|3.0|I liked this book fairly well.  I think that it was depressing, but if his life was derpressing, then he should portray it honestly.  I saw that some reviews said there was no misery in Limerick, because of the strong sense of community there.  I say that if he was miserable then there was misery.   Also, I notice on many of the reviews that are negative, even if its an  honest representation of the book, most people find it unhelpful.  It's the  same for other books.  Why is this?
0553278398|4.0|Considering how bad most prequels are, &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; is a pleasant surprise. I'm in the process of re-reading Foundation for the first time since high school and these books have aged very well. Prelude  contains material on the background of Hari Seldon and psychohistory, as  well as a rich and complicated view of a political world (Trantor). I'm not  sure how much of my enjoyment is fueled by knowing the later history of the  series, so I don't think that this is the best book to read first if you've  never read the Foundation books before.
0671015206|3.0|The writing is dry, sometimes difficult, and the charts and tables nearly impossible to understand. Practical advice is nowhere to be found. Yet everyone who isn't a millionaire and never believed they could be should read this book. I grew up in a working class home, often feeling inferior  to those who had more than me. Now I find out that my background can  actually tip the scales of wealth in my favor. It's good, too, to see in  print evidence that many of the people I'm trying to keep up with on the  way to the bank probably didn't earn their status the way I've had to; it  was given to them instead. Highly motivating.
B000002U82|5.0|This was the second Pink Floyd album I bought. The first one was &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; which I'd already fallen in love with. I didn't believe that  the same group could make another album just as great,  but I was wrong. Completely wrong. This is in three words a fantastic  album. My personal favourites are &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot; and  &quot;Money&quot; but all the songs are pure genious. This is the CD that  once and for all made me a Pink Floyd fan and it's much better than  everybody says it is.
630451087X|5.0|As the years pass I find myself increasingly less impressed by television and cinema.  Too simple.  They cater to the masses, but the masses do not want to think they want to be entertained.  Not so with David Lynch.  There  are few directors, producers, writers, etc. who I know I can count on to  provide thinking entertainment .  With Lost Highway I have been given  something to think about in order to understand.  I am constantly surprised  to discover so many people refusing to recognize greatness simply because  they do not understand it.  I love being forced to bushwack my way through  symbolism and metaphor to find the jewel of truth and/or meaning.  It makes  undertanding that much more fascinating and enjoyable.  In order to 'get'  Lost Highway you have to love working things out and even be willing to let  some things go (i.e. the impossible chronology of the film).   Undertstanding the director is helpful; a part of what makes David lynch so  intersting is that he utilizes bad scripting and acting for specific  purposes in his films.  Intelligently directed, written, edited, scored,  lighted, and acted, Lost Highway is nothing short of brilliant.
B000002WUD|5.0|In his final years-the 1970's-Elvis Presley made the best music of his career. He was no longer intent on capturing the teen market (the '50's) or lost in a muddled movie career where music was an afterthought (the '60's)  but making the music he  really loved and reflected the maturity of his  age. He always made awesome  music, but there was something special about  his 1969-1977 work that stands out. While his great 1969 Memphis work isn't  here, it's more than enough to hear obscure singles, forgotten album tracks  and amazing  unreleased recordings. I can recommend this 5-cd box set very  highly.
B0000042MY|5.0|This is the best soundtrack that I have ever listened to.  Even after eight years it is fresh and haunting every time I listen to it.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The guitar tones and drum tones are the best ever. The sound of this record is often imitated but never duplicated, not by a longshot. Billy Corgan is truly a musical genius, this album deserves better than the  &quot;alternative&quot; label it has been given. It is an essential  recording for anyone who has ears.
B000001Y42|5.0|Three Dollar Bill, Y'all puts Significant Other to shame.  I don't understand why the latter was endorsed so much.  There are few albums I can listen to continuously, and Three Dollar Bill, Y'all is one of them.  It is  more representative of Limp Bizkit's raw sound and talent; plus it's a lot  more intimate and less commercial.  Why it's remained so obscure is beyond  me.
B000000WA4|5.0|When i first heard the pumpkins were doing this record, i wondered if they would be able to come up with enough consistent material to fill 2 disks in one outing. Upon buying the record the day it came out, it made me believe  they could do anything...at the end of the sessions for mcis, they had  worked on over 100 songs for the record, most of them being of course  totally awesome, some never seeing the light of day (as is customary with  any pumpkins record).the pumpkins could have put out like 30 albums full of  rock and roll riff based songs based on what they did in these sessions but  Corgan obviously didnt want to do that, and it is strange, especially  considering how many albums they sold with mcis.but all in all it proves  that if you have talent and you work hard, you can achieve success on your  own terms without giving in to what the powers that be want you to do, it  is life affirming, looks for the positive side of the difficulty of life in  general...the music is so astonishing..no other band could have the depth  and talent to put songs like &quot;1979&quot; and &quot;tales of a scorched  earth&quot; back to back, and make them fit...the only other band who has  done work that even begins to rival the pumpkins is the beatles. this is  sacred plastic.
B00001R3GI|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece.  No other album captures the true essence of rhythm and blues like this one.  I feel rejunevated when I listen to Exile!  Unlike Sticky Fingers (which is a great collection of catchy songs and  some of my favorites like Dead Flowers, Sister Morphine, and Moonlight  Mile), this album is a single entity. I highly recommend devoting 70  minutes or so to listen to the entire album.  By the way, the remaster is  fabulous...excellent sound quality!
0945001193|2.0|Mein kampf roughly translated means my struggle. but how can a man who knows only hatered know anything about a struggle. in this in depth review of his life events he trys to portray his life as one of many inner tormoils. in the 600 or so pages he explicitly made his views known about  the jewish community. not being jewish i read this book with an open mind  and a huge curiosity about a book that has caused so much trouble. this  book however should NOT be read by anyone who i sthe least bit sensitive to  the subject matter portrayed. Hitler sees &quot;jewism&quot; as a plauge  and he thinks and feels its the jews that bring his country down. His own  inner stuggle comes to light in comments he makes such as &quot; i free the  world of all that is jewish so that i do the work of the almighty&quot;.  His fears are well shown as well as his insecurities. i would recomend this  book to anyone whith an open mind to just how sick our society has become.
B00000ILE7|3.0|Uneven episode in the ALIEN saga and perhaps the worst. However the accting is okay and the film is alright, but it seems far too dull and will prove dissapointing and boring for some.
0805209999|4.0|The Trial is a book that draws you into its sea of words and never lets you rise back up to the surface.  Once immersed in its content, you do not want to place it back down until you have finished it.  &quot;The  Trial,&quot; is about man enslaved trying to become truly free.  It is  about the cruelty of life and man's failure in trying to find some  importance, some meaning, some salvation that is inaccessible in the  physical world.
6304618344|5.0|There is absolutely no complaint from me about this well performed film. Superb acting, excellent plot and good actors. Face/off is one of the best action/thrillers ever!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have not seen the English version for this movie (only the Japanese one, and I don't speak the language) but it was still an EXCALLENT film! OK, the animation wasn't as &quot;smooth flowing&quot; as it could have been, but  the extreme attention to detail more than made up for that. The visuals  were AMAZING! It was so well done that I could understand what was  happening and even get into the film without knowing what was actually  being said. The ecxellent music and sound effects also helped me in this.  The charecters were well designed, too (especially San, the Forest God, and  the wolves).
078062369X|5.0|Blade is a very good film, with lots of gore and good plot. A sequel is inevitable.
B00000490M|5.0|the movie was great. i have to say that i really loved the cobra kai's. they were my favorite. i thought that bobby was the best(Ron Thomas). and if you are reading this write me! but otherwise it was a really cool,  interesting movie.
B00000JGEH|4.0|The first Terminator is not as good as the epic sequel that was made some years later. The plot is simple and this is still a fan fave and a cult sci-fi film.
6304994540|5.0|This movie is both hilarious and profound!  The complex relationship between the laidback Dude and the excitabe Walter is wonderfully cast and acted.  John Tuturro as Jesus is brilliant, Juliane Moore is cooly sexy;  the plot is goofy. The soundtrack is delightful.  I have never watched a  video over and over the way I have this one.  It's funny on so many levels,  and in spite of large doses of &quot;black&quot; humor and abundant  &quot;cussing&quot;, it's a very positive film.  The Dude abides.
6300213005|4.0|This is a pretty good film and when I first saw it, the scene where Emil gets toxic waste covered on him was pretty scary, as we watched him horribly melt away then get splattered. Robocop is often considered a joke,  but this film is quite powerful, in violence especially.
0060977493|4.0|The power behind Roy's exquisit rhythm is massive, and her ability to manipulate the sound of words is itself a pure stroke of genius.  Even if this book is not blessed with a strong storyline, the beauty of the language is certainly adequate for any thoughtful reader.  A story of  forbidden identities, God of Small Things tells a bittersweet tale of two  fraternal twins: Etha and Rahel.  Through the clear eyes of these children  with vague sense of themselves, Roy captures an India finally free from  Britain's rule.  There remains a English shadow in their universe, however,  as Etha and Rahel, along w/ their Rhodes scholar uncle, violin-playing  grandma, ex-nun babygrandma, and their beautiful beautiful mother, Ammu  strive to mend the shapeless hole in their universe.  Things indeed change  in a day as Etha and Rahel's English cousin is found dead...<br />Taking place  on the threshold of revolution, and staggering in the midst of the angry  waves as a nation cries out for change, God of Small Things does a fabulous  job patching together tiny fragments of a long forgotten dream in the  hearts of two children, whose lives are changed forever by one fateful day.   This is a romance of Ammu and the man &quot;her children love by  day&quot;, a coming-of age tale of twins that are forced to become unique,  and at last, a tragedy of the spirit of a country pushed towards brutality  and vengeance by the same force that brought about the so-called progress.
0780620003|4.0|Amazing special F/X in this brilliant sci-fi/fantasy flick. In the style of BATMAN we have a glorified hero battling evil, but don't be confused as SPAWN is from hell, but he soon realises he must choose good. I can see  this as being classed as a cult film.
B000002HMH|4.0|ok people stop bashing metallica for changing their music.....there is nothing wrong with this cd....which i thoroughly enjoyed. sure its not as good as the black album but metallica is still heavy and this cd is a  little darker and meaner than some of their previous work. until it  sleeps,king nothing,hero of the day , bleeding me are very good songs.i  think its good metallics changed directiomn in their music a little and if  u r a really big metallica fan u wont notice the change that much.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I had a small preview of the album prior to it's release and as usual, I was truely amazed. I like how each song can take many twists. It's hard to not like Michael Cretus music but then again, every one has their own taste in music. I've played this CD for many people who don't know who Enigma is, and in every case, there has been a 100% immediate attraction to the music.  I for one believe that this is one of the best albums to date and would  DEFINATELY recommend buying it.
B000002HRE|5.0|ok who says metallica isnt as heavy as they used to be? listen to fuel and memory remains and u will think differently ..they are 2 of metallicas heaviest songs and 2 of their best! THIS CD IS BETTER  THAN LOAD WHICH WAS  AWESOME.UNFORGIVEN2 ISNT AS GOOD AS ORIGINAL BUT IS STILL INCREDIBLY  AWESOME.SLITHER , CARPE DIEM BABY, BAD SEED, AND WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE  ARE ALSO BIG WINNERS. THIS FEATURES SOME OF THEIR BEST LYRICAL AND GUITAR  WORK.IN MYOPINION ONLY THE BLACK ALBUM WINS OVER THIS ONE. BUY IT!
0679745203|5.0|Michael Ondaatje has the touch. Like a painter, he brushes the landscape of war-ravished scenes into our mind. He dabs into his watercolors and paints such unforgetable characters as Hana and Carravaggio and the  kipper--and, with a truly genius stroke of person, the Patient himself. A  masterful work.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|I was surprised at the variety and inventiveness of all the songs on their self-titled cd, finding each song to have a special something that clicked and found a nitch.  This album isn't quite like that.  It has beautifully  written songs and is carefully and wonderfully arranged, but only perhaps  three or four songs really stand out as being &quot;different&quot;  (Affirmation, Chained to you, The animal song, Gunning down romance.).  The  rest of the songs are absolutely beautiful (I knew i loved you and Hold me  are breathtaking) and worth listening to, but they don't stand out.  I do  like this whole cd, save two songs (You can still be free and Two beds and  a coffee machine), and would recommend it highly.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I think that Savage Garden have really good music because there not like all those other boy bands and they don't promote violence, but the things that you should enjoy in life.
B0000025BL|5.0|This is one of Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman's best and all the others, who say it is not and gave it 1 star, should explain it. What's more, look at the other reviews and see that almost everybody gave it 5 stars ,so who  like it, will read those ones with 5 stars. Buy This CD if you can and if  you like Meat Loaf or Jim Steinman's other works. You'll like this one too.
0684872153|2.0|Frank McCourt's writing style is fantastic, but the content of Angela's Ashes leaves much to be desired.  I like a book that teaches moral integrity, that shows that man or woman can overcome the filth of everyday  life.  This book did not meet that criteria.
B000000WF9|5.0|after seeing the film and bumping to this soundtrack by accident the music immediately brought back to my mind the feelings in the film. this soundtrack is very beautiful, longing. very strong music.
B00000K0DT|5.0|WOW! This has to be one of the best films ever to be made.  The plot, the characters, the acting.  All superb. If you haven't seen it yet then why not? Are you mad? Kevin Spacey once again proves how talented he is and is  well supported by the cast.  A tight script and a quality plot keep you on  edge throughout.  To say too much would spoil the film.  Just buy it, sit  back and enjoy a cinematic masterpiece.
0385493800|3.0|I have read other books from John Grisham and have been a great experience, &quot;The Testament&quot; is another good one. When I bought it I thought that the story was going to be about the misfortune of Troy Phelan, but as you keep on reading you find that it goes far beyond it, is  about giving a lesson to his &quot;loved&quot; family, and finding the  person or heir who is not interested in her fathers money. I liked it very  much, but would have liked even more if it had been focused a little more  on Phelans story, and a little less on searching for Rachel Lane in the  Pantanal.
B00000IBRX|1.0|Painfully boring!  Ten minutes into this movie and I could care less where Robin's character was, what he did, where he went, what he thought! Boring! Boring! Boring!
B000000WA4|5.0|This is one of the greatest cd's of all time. Bar none. Smashing Pumpkins are no dought THE band of the 90's. Nobody with the exception of Radiohead has come out with consistantly terrific cd's. And Mellon Collie is no  exception. Its a grand, epic CD, that is very musically diverse. It will  please both bangers, and soft music lovers. The best hard songs are  &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;An Ode To no one&quot;, and &quot;Where boys fear  to tread&quot;. There are also touching ballads like &quot;Cupid de  Locke&quot;, and &quot;Lily my one and only&quot;. In one word I would  describe this album as &quot;Flawless&quot;.
B000001085|5.0|This is a sort of best-of live featuring Deep Purple tracks, solo stuff, and one song from Hughes/Thrall. Backed by a hard rock band of Northern European  session men, here Hughes is in fine form, playing songs you know with  conviction. He doesn't quite out-yowl Ian Gillan and the Robert Plant  wannabe photo on the back cover is a bit much, but this is GREAT live rock  and roll.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I've gone through the 300 and something reviews down here and I've been struck by the fact that many reviewers regard a symphony orchestra like a group of people who can only play gentle and soft things....a violin can  have a gentle sound and the whole string section can blow you out of your  seat if written in a particular way....it's just too simplistic and way  stupid to think just because an orchestra is an orchestra that it has no  guts or ability to play harsh....and this album proves it...Now, the way we  listen to this album has nothing to do with the way it might have sounded  in the hall and even better...on stage! Michael Kamen and the band must  have had the heck of a astounding sound where they where playing, with no  mixes and the full orchestra playing loud and clear....If you don't believe  me that an orchestra can blow you right of your socks, listen to  Stravinsky's The Rite Of Spring, some parts of this work are so violent,  full of rage and harsh that it would take four bands like Metallica to  match the force of this sound. On the other side, the idea is splendid and  works...definitely! Lars,James, Kirk and Jason's music has never sounded so  complete even though I understand that some fans might prefer the  non-symphonic versions...Still the work of orchestration and conducting  done by Michael Kamen here is outstanding and the band seems to be really  giving the best of themselves...Everyone seems to be living an  extraordinary experience and it shows!  I know that the blending of two  separate worlds like HM and an orchestra might scare some and ispire them  rejection but the result here is mind-blowing...be open-minded and give it  a try.  The liner notes by Michael Kamen are great and make you understand  even better this unique event. Anyway, far better than any previous merging  of an orchestra with a rock or HM band done in the last 30 years...
0688156819|5.0|I have always admired the on-screen work of Tim Burton but had not known about his literary endeavours.  When I was given this book as a present I did not expect much of it even though the title intrigued me and front cover art work was bizarre.  I found this to be a collection of surreal  accounts of abnormal children but still able to touch and allow the reader  to endear to these beastly freaks of nature.  The darkness in these stories  are reminiscent of much of Burton's film work and the artwork is almost as  powerful as the stories themselves.  This book works on every possible  level as it is simple yet sinister enough to be potent.  A definite  must-read for all those with a slightly twisted outlook on the world!
0060920084|1.0|What boring, superficial stuff! I could pick up better and more interesting and funnier impressions of a place by driving through it at sixty miles an hour than this deadbeat can by hanging around for a week!
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, in my opinion, is the epitome of a love story.  I found myself in complete suspense to find out if darcy and elizabeth got together.  Jane Austen combines 19th century wit with romance to create a  book that you just can't put down.  Elizabeth Bennet is a heroine that  cannot be forgotten; her wit and sense are apparent throughout the whole  story.  Darcy is a mysteriously romantic character who, despite his cutting  remarks, remains irrestistable.  The reading itself can be a little  uneventful sometimes, but Jane Austen saves it with a sarcastic comment  from Mr. Bennet, or a witty remark from Elizabeth.  This is my favorite  book ever and i recommend it to anybody who can appreciate the 1800s style  of writing.
B000035Z2L|5.0|I liked this movie cuz it was some what true about us teens and was update to date.  It was hillarious and had some good actresses and actors which always helps.  I think it was a all around good movie.  It good and all  teens should see it!
B000002TYK|4.0|There Is Nothing Left To Lose is a CD that turns out a mixed bag at some points while shining at others.  Dave Grohl's voice never gets old, and he really excels during tracks like Learn To Fly, Generator, and Aurora.  Some  of the harder rocking songs tend to blend together after a while, but the  slower songs more than make up for that.  Those are the tracks that you can  listen to for hours.  It's definitely a step in the right direction for the  band.  Keep puttin' out great music!
B000002J1S|5.0|I remember in high school hearing a list of all the books we should read if we want to be thought of as well-read. Well, if there were such a list for music, this would be on it. This album was influential to many other  bands of the time, and is still discussed passionately in USEnet newsgroups  today. <BR><BR> This album tells the story of Rael, a young gang member in  New York City who finds himself taken to a horrific dreamscape, and his  attempts to get home. The story is hard to follow through just the music,  but the liner notes tell the whole story in prose. The story itself is  confusing and surreal, and can be interpreted in many ways. There are  religious undertones throughout, elements of death, humor, symbolism and  allegory, and the feeling of a driving need to get home. Some interpret the  story as a dream, others say Rael dies in the beginning of the story, and  the album tells the story of his soul's quest for ascension. <BR><BR> It's  strange to review an album and not talk that much about the music as such.  But the music integrates so well with the story, you forget it's only a  rock album, and feel catapulted into the dreamscape with Rael in his quest  to find his way home. It draws you in, pitches your emotions haphazardly  along the way, and leaves you hungry for more. It was the band's best work  at the time, and in many ways, they've still not surpassed it.<BR><BR> It  is unfortunate that Peter Gabriel left the group after this album, but at  the same time, I don't know how they could possibly follow it up  successfully. If you do like this album, however, an 80s band called  Marillion sound a good deal like old Genesis, at least in their early  albums (Script for a Jester's Tear, Fugazi, Misplaced Childhood, Clutching  at Straws). In some ways, they picked up this style when Genesis left it  off to go on to other things.<BR><BR> I recommend this album for anyone who  wants more from music than just dancing.

0782008119|5.0|Hype proved to be an excellent documentary covering the essential grunge bands The musicians were interesting and had a sense of humor. Some of them, such as Eddie Vedder had worth while takes on stardom and the role  money and commerce play in it. This movie created the perfect atmosphere  surronding the northwest rock explosion. It also introduced viewers to some  excellent, underrated bands who never hit the mainstream. A definate must  have.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Roberto Benigni was fabulous and the movie had excellent backgrounds. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it or not, because it was in Italian, but once you  start reading you will think they are talking English. I recommend you see  this movie in Italian. This is a really great movie, and it is worth your  money to go out and buy it on DVD or VHS. If you don't believe me, then  check out the oscars they won for Best Actor and Best Forign Picture. I  laughed and I cried. No doubt in my mine would I hesitate to buy this movie  at all.
6301562925|5.0|Halloween 5 is the BEST Halloween film EVER!It was a little bit scary,little bit gore,and a little bit funny.<br />This movie is BETTER than Halloween 4,6,and H20.It shows how he became evil but Halloween 6 tells how he became evil.<br />And for ,probaly,the first time it shows Michael Myers  unmasked!<br />If your a Halloween fan GET this movie!It's TWO thumbs up!5  STARS!And it deserve to win a ACADEMY AWARD!<br />Get it or he will get  REVENGE on YOU!
B000021Y77|5.0|This is one of the best films I have seen in a great long while.  The cinematography is groundbreaking, the storyline is impossible to predict, and the sidelines to the story are great - both the bedroom conversations  that describe Manni's true feelings toward his girlfriend, and thoughts  about death, and the 10-second flashes into the lives of side characters  and how those lives are affected by the decisions the main characters take.   I suppose I would like this film less if I didn't also like techno, but  even if you don't, this movie has just so much to offer, and is so  amazingly different than the formula movies, that you have to see it.  I'm  one of those bastards in the movie theatre who tends to know what's about  to happen before it actually does, and I almost spoke aloud, &quot;For  crying out loud, it's only 20 minutes into the movie.  It's not like the  main character's going to die.&quot;  WRONG!  The plot twists are  impossible to imagine before you see it.  (And I'm not giving anything  away, eitehr)  Final note: My cousins visisted me (in San Francisco) from  Germany, and said it was the best German film they had ever seen.  That  they ended up seeing it in America, in German with English subtitles, made  it a bit surreal for them.  But still, an outstanding film all the way  around.  I can't wait for more movies by this director.
1567406831|1.0|Aside from being poorly written and full of trite examples and anecdotes, this book will not change your life.  The advice on how to live is so old and over used it might have well been dispensed from a five year old.   People turn to this book in order to give meaning and significance to their  lives.  Yet, the keys to a happy and rewarding life can not be found in  best-selling pseudo-self help books.  I advice starting somewhere a little  more intellectually stimulating, but then again it is probably easier just  to turn on the TV.
B000002UCQ|4.0|Well, the album is quite OK, though the instrumentals at the end are totally useless. But am I the only one on the Web who noticed that in &quot;Isn't it a pity&quot;'s fade, a minor variation of the tag theme from  &quot;hey jude&quot; could be heard quite clearly?
B00002Z88D|5.0|This CD was a great work by Metallica. I enjoyed it very much. If you are a Metallica fan, buy it now. The best song is probably &quot;For whom the Bell Tolls&quot; The crowd sounds so excited all throughout the concert.  Great stuff!

0783228317|5.0|Whilst the pro-drug stance of 'Fear and Loathing' may not be everybody's cup of tea (their loss, I confess), it is nonetheless a brilliantly entertaining, terrifying experience. I read the book after watching the  film and that did little to diminish my respect for Terry Gilliams  adaption. In fact, upon further contemplation I would say that it hightened  my appreciation for Gilliam by his razor-sharp focus and almost  word-for-word adaption. In short, visuals are fab, story is sharp and  fast-paced, acting fits the bill and they do find the American Dream. In  fact, I'd argue that they are the American Dream, but watch for yourself  and decide
B000002UZ4|5.0|The very first PSB CD I bought, and also my fave. It's got all the hits (West End Girls, Opportunities, Suburbia, Heart, Love Comes Quickly, Always On My Mind, DJ Culture, It's A Sin..) and it nicely showcases PSB's great  musical talents. <br />It's definitely one of the best CDs ever released, and  it's a superb introductory CD for new PSB fans. <br />Buy it! I'm totally SURE  you'll love it!
0684833395|4.0|Recently, I decided to abandon my Crichton, Clancy, and Rice books to begin more \\"serious\\" reading.  &quot;Catch-22&quot; was my first foray into the heavy artillery.  What a refreshing change!  Although it took a few chapters to really get a feel for the rhythm of the book, I was instantly  hooked.  The atmosphere, the dialogue, the humor...head and shoulders above  anything else I've read.<br />It all revolves around Yossarian, a character  that wasn't very likeable for a good chunk of the novel.  As the story  unfolded, he evolved from a coward, to a pitiable product of a  dysfunctional environment, to a beacon of strength and sanity in an insane  world.<br />Heller's dry, satirical style was perfect for delivering this  great story full of quirky, all-too-real characters.
B000024QML|5.0|Totally AWESOME CD with great lyrics and great music (wonderful happy dance pop and with a few (i think) latin tunes), it's probably one of the best PSB albums so far! Every single song is great, especially Go West,  Different Point of View and Dreaming of the Queen. A MUST BUY!  (The hot  pink doesn't exactly look very pretty among a mostly staid black and white  CD collection though..but then PSB's always uniquely different) Also look  out for the hidden track after Go West!
6305657947|4.0|I enojoyed this DVD very much.  The plot is one of a kind.  Though Rene Russo is getting old, and the DVD contains few special features, I recomend this DVD strongly.
B000002B35|5.0|I will probably review disc 1 later, but for now, let me set the record straight about disc 2: these are some killer live versions of great Pink Floyd songs, and don't let anyone else on this page tell you otherwise.  Gilmour sang the original versions of these songs like some young, uptight  British kid, but on Pulse his voice is more manly and gravelly, but at the  same time more fluid, and alltogether more forceful. The only aspect of the  songs that doesn't quite hit par is the synthesizers, but I guess its kind  of hard to get a really great stereo mix from a live show. Speaking of  which, I wish I was there when this was recorded, and if you listen to it  you will too.
0062502182|5.0|This work is a masterpeice!  Coelho is a genius in which he expresses the idea of following your dreams.  This book teaches you to follow the omens, to just look at the little things in life that come along.  One little  thing could lead to one enormous thing.  When I read this book, I copied  down all of the quotes and lines that just hit me in the heart.  In the end  I just yelled, &quot;YES!&quot;  Coelho has been blessed, for he has  changes the lives of millions of people in just 167 pages.  I recommend  this book to anyone looking for &quot;the&quot; answer! Thanks!
B000005H7D|5.0|This Coltrane disc is one that can be listened to intensely for the purpose of gleening musical gems to give your consciousness a nice sparkle to last well past the end of the recording.  As well, this can be put in  the background and just let the osmosis that in all of Coltrane's great  works just kind of permeate into your day.  It's almost like some of  Coltrane's flesh comes through his horn.  This one is even for people who  don't care for pure Jazz because is stands to test of accesibility over and  over.<br />No matter how many times I hear it, I still enjoy it and hear  something else that makes me smile.
0385015364|5.0|My initial reaction about halfway through the first chapter was, &quot;This man thinks way too much.&quot;<br />The depth to which Chesterton attacks the most mundane of topics is staggering.  Who ever considered the  &quot;rightness&quot; of fairy tales, and the &quot;wrongness&quot; of  everyday life to such a degree?  (in the Ethics of Elfland)<br />This is the  perfect precursor to Bloom's &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;,  because Chesterton here exposes for us the philosophical background of the  problems of Post-Modern thought which Bloom describes.  Another  complimentary book would be Ravi Zacharias's &quot;Deliver Us from  Evil&quot;.

B0000028RR|5.0|i sat down and listend to rage against the machines first album. the way Zach De La Rocha expresses his political veiws is outstanding.  tom morello adds somthing that no other guitar player can do.  there is no band today  that can be compared to rage against the machine.
6305268843|5.0|If you are a romantic, you will adore this movie. I never saw or heard of Stephen Dillane before but,( where has he been hiding?) I believe any female will fall in love with him. This movie kept my attention from the  moment it started until it ended. I saw it three times, and I also ordered  it from Amazon.com.Can't wait to see it again, again and again. Hope you  enjoy it as much as I did.
0380973464|5.0|It's got everything, and the kitchen sink.  As for loose ends, a careful reading of the scene when Enoch Root is shot will reveal that his death was faked.  The ending is of course simply setting the stage for the next  volume in the series, so if you're looking for a punch line you'll be  disappointed. This novel is a 900 page cornucopia of history, philosophy,  conspiracy theories, cryptography, etc., etc.  If you're ready to sit down  to a 10 course gourmet feast of ideas and new perspectives, give it a try.  If you are simply hungry for a Whopper and want a cheap, slick and quick  read with a slam-bang ending that goes in the can when you're done, stick  with Grisham or Clancy.
B000006OAM|5.0|Merchant returned to true form with this album.  I for one did not care for the midle of the road pop tunes on her debut disc, Tigerlily, and was genuinely impressed by her sophomore effort.Ophelia is a model album, and  although it does delve into dark and somewhat contemplative thought, it's  soul is spirit-lifting.  From the haunting and all-encompassing title track  to the eerily anachronistic remake of an 1887 song (When they ring the  Golden Bells), Natalie is at home in the material.Unfortunately for  Merchant, her chief single from this album was the throwaway pop track  &quot;Kind and Generous.&quot;  The far superior single &quot;Break Your  Heart&quot; was largely ignored, and it is a pity for it had lush trumpets,  beautiful rhythums, and Merchant's warbling voice to ease between the  notes.  Flip in this CD for an evening of enjoyment!While it admittedly can  be less than inspiring at times, Ophelia is a maserfully crafted album.
6303212263|5.0|I should point out that this review is for the wide screen version of the video which I managed to track down a few years ago. If ever a film was deserving of a remastered DVD transfer this is it - current rumours have an  DVD ETA for end of year 2000.<br />From the rousing opening credits which  features, in my humble opinion, the best movie theme ever written - sorry  Mr. Lucas, but I'm afraid Mr. Williams out-scored himself for this one -  through to it's cliffhanging climax this motion picture has it all. Great  cinematography, superb performances - special mention must go to  Christopher Reeve who played both roles to perfection -, a top notch script  courtesy of Mario 'Godfather' Puzo and confident direction from the, at  times uneven, Richard 'The Omen/Lethal Weapon 1/2/3/4' Donner. The special  effects have stood the test of time very well indeed and, despite some  dodgy blue-screen work, you WILL believe a man can fly. In fact if you  compare the flying sequences from this movie to the subsequent sequels you  will notice a dramatic deterioration from 1st to 4th - this in itself is a  testament to the amount of work put into the original.<br />So there you have  it, whether you are a sceptical first-time viewer, a fan of the whole  Superman mythology or just an ardent movie lover this is one film that more  than holds it's own against today's inferior plagiarists. <br />Sit back and  enjoy. Then later, as you drift off to sleep, prepare to don those tights  and take off.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's probably pointless to argue which album is the greatest in the history of rock and roll -- that's largely a matter of subjective opinion.  But &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a true masterpiece, an album on which the  Beatles managed the almost-impossible feat of being both experimental and  accessible.  Many albums from the late 60s, even great ones, sound dated  today.  But after 30 years, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; still sounds fresh and  innovative.  Indeed, to my ears it's more sophisticated, more mature and  more complex than almost anything on today's Top 40 radio.  Although  &quot;Let It Be&quot; was the last official Beatles release (not counting  the &quot;Anthology&quot; CDs in the 90s), &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was the  last one the group recorded, and it was a beautiful, dignified note upon  which to end their brilliant career.
B000002L7R|5.0|This CD has my favorite Prince song of all time, RASPBERRY BERET. When I first got this CD, I thought it was uneven, but now I love every song. The whole album is very melodic, with lush arrangements that have lots of  violins and synthesizers. Of course there's lots of Prince's trademark  funky drum sound too. The Revolution had a lot to do with the classy,  melodic sounds of this album, and it is a shame that Wendy &amp; Lisa never  got more credit, since they contributed so much to Prince's music. The most  beautiful moment in the whole album comes during the long intro to  &quot;Condition of the Heart&quot;, the piano solo is just unforgettable.  This album has a certain magic to it that I've never heard anywhere else.  Give it time to grow on you, &quot;The reward is great for those who want 2  go...&quot;
B000002A3T|5.0|This CD is my favorite.  It's for anyone who likes the latter floyd stuff.  Gilmour is great w/ the lyrics and anyone who can't fully appreciate this work shouldn't call themself a floydian fan.  The best songs on this album  are LOST FOR WORDS and WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME.  I think this album was  Gilmour's, Wright's, and Mason's greatest work ever.  If you love beautiful  lyrics, guitar, and drums (Mason never gets the credit he deserves)you have  to buy this album.
B00000K19E|5.0|To preface this review...I am not much of an action fan, and CERTAINLY not a sci-fi fan.  It just isn't my choice of genre.  So, when everyone praised this movie and all of its special effects, I was skeptical. I have to  admit, though, the special effects blew me away from beginning to end, and  the plot was surprisingly good too. I first saw this movie on VHS and  immediately wanted it on DVD...the DVD definitely adds a lot of dimensions  that you can't get the full effect of on VHS. I highly recommend this film  for everyone, not just for sci-fi or action fanatics.
0375707972|1.0|I hate it when I waste my money on a book that  I can't even finish because it is so bad.
B000009QO6|5.0|Ex-Misfits lead singer Danzig, comes back from the grave with his first solo record. Danzig, attemps to do a &quot;metal&quot; album, which doesn't even sounds like a metal album. It's more of a gothic/pop-metal album. Ok,  it has some metal influence on it. But the point is, this album rocks. It's  catchy and dark too, what else could you ask for in a album. Danzig still  has that Misfits touch to it by bringning gothic to the pop world. Best  songs off this 1988 album are &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Am I Demon&quot;  and &quot;She Rides&quot;. Classic 80's album to own.
B00000IOSU|5.0|As much as I want to not sound like a crazed fan, I can't help but think Sarah McLachlan is possibly the best singer I've ever heard. I didn't catch on too quickly, it wasn't until this album I ever even heard of her, but  when I did I became an instant fan. Her voice singing ability are  absolutely captivating and her songs are just as powerful in melody,  message, and soul. The best thing I can say is probably the fact these days  if I hear a song by Sarah McLachlan, even if it's new and I'm not familiar  with it, I instantly recognise it's her, and can't stop listening til the  song is over. I can not recommend this album enough.
068484267X|5.0|This book is so moving that I could only read a little at a time.  I finally obtained the Audio version and found it to be more sorrowful but so very beautiful.  I am no hungry for Irish History and I would like Frank  McCourt to recomment a place for me to start.   Barbara Stevenson
B00000JZC4|5.0|This is the essential CD to own. Never have I been more impressed with the content of each and every song a group puts out. If you buy it for &quot;Take a picture&quot;, great, but get ready to be blown away. Richard  Patrick seems to touch every emotion from a loathing love to forgiveness  with his lyrics. I swear it is the best 12 bucks you'll ever spend...
B00000JGHM|5.0|Michael Mann has constructed a masterpiece of a cops-and robbers movie in a genre that so often receives the slam-bang approach.  While being a little concerned that the movie would be a repeat of his handling of the  novel \\"Red Dragon\\"  - that became the movie \\"Manhunter\\", or a big screen  \\"Miami Vice\\", nothing could be further from the truth.  Mann skillfully  brings out first rate performances from the lead players: The master thief  of De Niro juxtaposed with Pacino's workaholic cop is a masterstroke of  casting that works so well.  Pacino is delightfully over the top in his  portrayal of the dedicated, sacrifice-everything police professional  determined to stop the equally professional  \\"crew\\" headed by De Niro.  The  crew is wonderfully played by Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore, with Sizemore in  particular giving one of his finest screen performances as the  action-seeking professional crook who could, financially, walk away from  the life of crime that serves to fuel his adrenaline glands as much as his  bank balance.<br />Robert De Niro is outstanding in his portrayal of Neil, the  time-served thief: A man determined never to go back behind bars, yet  unable or unwilling to pursue any other way of life. The meeting of De Niro  and Pacino in the coffee shop scene is a cornerstone to the explosive  action sequences that climax with the final bank heist.  This has to be one  of the all-time greatest actions sequences ever filmed and is a set piece  of the movie that will become, undoubtedly, a benchmark for other action  movie directors.  It out does the car/train chase scene from \\"The French  Connection!\\" Top marks to Mann for the tight and well-edited screenplay and  direction, leaving you wanting more even at the end of three hours.  Well  worth the money!
B00002E285|4.0|I am an ardent follower of Pink Floyd and recently  purchased the VHS re-release. Although the movie is just as good as I remembered it, contrary to what you see above, the VHS edition is NOT in wide screen format. There  are very few added scenes, but nevertheless it is a very enjoyable and  well-done movie.
B000009QPG|1.0|Ok, lets supoose Slayer is a good metal band. Why the singer cant sing at all? WHy Hanneman and King (ercognized by their own fans) cant make a good solo at all? WHy Dave Lombardo left the band? THis is garbage.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Hedwig is the first theatre piece to seamlessly blend authentic rock and roll and drama. Everyone I know who has listened to the music becomes seriously hooked on it, and I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to be  moved, inspired, and hear some great songs.
B000001C6M|1.0|SLayer appeared in the musical scenario along with Metallica, Mercyful fate and others. The success of Metallica shows who was the best musicians. Slayer is satisfied with playing disguised as radicals. At least they dont  write lyrics like &quot;Necrophilaic&quot; anymore...
B000002UKS|5.0|All the other albums by the Foo Fighters stink, but this one is exceptional. You should particulary listen to Hey Johnny Park, Monkey Wrench, Enough Space, and Doll. The guitar is GOOD, and when he says that  &quot;One in Ten&quot; part in Monkey Wrench, he really strains his voice!  On the negative side, however, this CD doesn't meet up to your expectations  for very long. But it is DEFINETLEY worth the money!
B00000DR8R|5.0|Rattlesnakes is a nearly perfect pop album.   In the late 1980s, the time for singer/songwriters seemed past.  But Rattlesnakes showed that lyrically creative material set to jaunty pop tunes still resonated.  Whether it is a  woman sharing with us the profound pick-up line &quot;do you want to go to  heaven, or would you rather not be saved?&quot; or the ironic refrain of  being &quot;four flights up&quot; and still feeling like &quot;I'm  underground&quot;,  the lyrics transport us to places we often search out,  and rarely hear memorialized in song.  The Commotions provide a folk pop  backing which is gentle and yet derived from the &quot;rock&quot; tradition  much more than the soul or slick pop that would characterize some later  Cole work.  Cole's voice is expressive--alternatively exuberant, gentle or  tinged with despair.  With a dozen years' hindsight, we wish that Lloyd  Cole's muse and the corporations for which he recorded had continued him  down this path, and deflected him from some of the more &quot;hip&quot; and  commercial paths he later tried to tread.  Still, this is a great work of  understated beauty.  This album anticipates Duncan Sheik quite a bit, and  yet is in some ways more boisterous and witty than Mr. Sheik's excellent  first album (which it may well have influenced).  If you do not have this  one, I strongly urge you to buy it.
0767840135|5.0|I have seen 2 Cirque du Soleil shows live, and video does not do Cirque du Soleil justice.  There is so much to see in the real show that you feel much more part of the show as the action is going on around you.  There is  so much to see in the live show that you walk out of the show barely  remembering half of what you saw, but knowing that it was all spectacular  and unbelievable.  Because of the nature of the show, seeing it on DVD is a  far cry from watching it live, but it is still worth the price of the DVD.   Even watching the DVD will cause your jaw to drop to the floor.  Well worth  the money and you can watch it over and over to remember how spectacular it  all is.  The DVD does seem to leave out parts of the show, but I think it  is mainly the clowns, and they do some things that would spoil the live  show for you if you saw it on video first.
B000007MVX|5.0|Passion Play reminds me of Stairway to Heaven in the sense that it start out really softly and keeps on building until at the end it goes back to soft.  I got this cd about two weeks ago and I cannot stop playing it.  It  is 45 minutes long, but it does not seem like that.  I feel like I am  watching an adventure movie as I go through it.  Jethro Tull is at their  best during Passion Play.  Ian Anderson is an amazing flute player.  I have  thirteen of their cd's and I don't think I have heard Ian play the flute  any better than in this album.  This 45 minute piece is rock and roll,  jazz, blues, and poetry in one.  If you love music get this cd.  Great  lyrics!  I think the critics must have been on drugs when they reviewed  this album.  I just listened to the entire thing thru and I am 16 minutes  into it again.  If fact I have it on repeat.  Just buy it!  I recommend  starting with Living in the Past or Original Masters.  Then get Songs from  the Wood, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Passion Play, etc.  Have fun  listening!
B0000009SI|5.0|Love him or hate him, there is no denying that Frank Zappa produced some of the most interesting and musical recordings in  Rock.  Apostrophe(') is quite possibly one of Franks finest.  The album opens with &quot;Don't Eat  The Yellow Snow/Nanook Rubs  it&quot;.  The titles are separated on the  jacket, with different times listed for each, but in typical Zappa style  there is no dead air  between any of the tracks.  This CD leans less toward  the protracted jazz/rockish type of song writing of the mothers and leans   more toward the more  compact rock/pop song writing that characterized his  later recordings.  The disc continues on with  &quot;St. Alfonzo's Pancake  Breakfast,&quot; which melts into &quot;Father O'Blivion.&quot;  One can't  help  but wonder where his inspiration came from for any of his music, and  this is no exception.  Then again, with song writing this  brilliant, who  cares?  The music is funky enough to make you tap your foot, with hooks the  will have you humming all day at  work.  Your going to want to run home and  listen to this cd all the time.  Words can't really do the music justice,  but if you  could imagine blues and funk mixed with jazz and given a good  stiff does of sometimes brash irony, you'd begin to get an  understanding.   Of course Zappa is constantly experimenting with sounds and arrangements,  and this disc is no exception.   Unlike some of his other recordings,  however, he seems to sticks a little closer to a more traditional vein.   Well...traditional for him, anyhow. The CD continues on with  &quot;Cosmic  Debris,&quot; a short, funny, R&amp;B inspired tune about a &quot;mystery  man&quot; that is classic Zappa.The album continues with  &quot;Excentrifugal Forz,&quot; &quot;Apostrophe,&quot; a nearly 6 minute  instrumental that reeks of early 70's funk, the Bluesy &quot;Uncle  Remis,&quot; and ends with the classic jam song &quot;Stink-Foot.&quot;   All of the tunes are tight and well written with superb musicianship and  some really fine guitar work - something that Frank doesn't often get  enough recognition for. This is the kind of CD you can listen over and over  again and hear something  new every time.  As you might expect, its laced  with irony and sexual innuendo - adult material and definitely something  you shouldn't play around young children.  Probably all of Zappa's work  could be described as brilliant, but   Apostrophe(') hits the nail square  on the head.  It's definitely worth the price of admission - and then some.
B0000025SB|5.0|Dark Side is the greatest CD ever.  The Final Cut is the 2nd greatest.  It's that simple!
B00000IPAX|5.0|&quot;What's my age again&quot; and &quot;all the small things&quot; are two of the best songs to come out last year and the vidoes are great too.  Some reveiwers say Blink 182 is punk, others say they're pop, others say  mainstream rock...who gives a F**k! I like bands that make good MUSIC,  period.  I don't care what &quot;style&quot; they are.  True music lovers  don't care either.  Stop trying to pin labels on these guys and just enjoy  this CD.
B000000WA4|5.0|Ever heard about the fist, which when opened up, reveals a live butterfly inside. Hard and tough on the outside, but soft and gentle inside. That's what this album is like. It is filled with little gems, that grab you, one  by one. Each song grows on you as you listen to it more and more. And trust  me, you will listen again and again... Billy's vocals swirl around the  music screaming now, and then whispering softly. This album encompasses  such a wide range of musical styles that it is quite difficult to classify.  But then, why bother with labels, after all, these are the Smashing  Pumpkins!
B000031XCR|5.0|I like the music of Celine Dion. I have several of her CDs in my collection, but when I bought this one I really wanted to have a collection of her best songs. The CD &quot;All The Way...A Decade of Song&quot; has a  very good quality of sound and a compilation of one of her best songs. An  amazon CD. I think everybody would love this CD.
6304240554|4.0|&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is the only movie that I have seen in recent years which genuinely frightened me. My brother and I rented it on a Friday and started it late at night. We decided to watch the rest of it the next  day. But, I won't forget watching the first part: the fear that thousands  of zombies are going to rush out of somewhere and outnumber the heroes. Or  that a ton of zombies will leap out from around a corner. The story  concerns two SWAT cops, a TV news producer, and her boyfriend -- the TV  station's news helicopter pilot -- getting out of Philadelphia when dead  bodies turn into zombies and start killing the living. This film is  atmospheric and claustrophobic. And Romero's idea of using a shopping mall  as the setting of the core of the story was a true stroke of genius --  where better to confront the human condition of materialism, selfishness,  and a whole ton of nasty zombies? The film was made in the late 1970's for  a slim $1.5 million. But, it was put to good use -- showing that Romero  knew how to stretch a dollar, making it go a long way. My only complaint  about the movie is the gore, which is actually what the film is most famous  for. These scenes come at the beginning and end of the film. (The end is  where the zombies feasting on live humans kicks into SERIOUS overload)  These scenes show too much and go on far too long, but I guess Romero  wanted to show just how threatening the zombies could really be. Too bad  he's not doing that &quot;Resident Evil&quot; movie. But, that's okay.  Stick with this film. It's the real thing (no pun intended).
B00000K2SC|5.0|The matrix is a wonderfully crafted movie with eye-pleasing special effects and an engaging storyline.  I loved this movie and so far I have seen it four times.  Everytime I have watched it i've noticed or learned  something new.  Lawrence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves are phenomenal.

B00000JXV7|2.0|this movie is a triumph of cliche: the plot is one you've seen so many times before that you can't believe anyone would flog it one more time(a road/buddie movie where the leads are of opposite temperament and gender,  and end up (surprise! ) entangled). the characters are similarly  stereotyped: the blonde-next-door sweetheart, the befuddled, bewildered,  stodgy male, the whore with the heart of gold who sets him free (to return  to his sweetheart as a wiser and deeper man). the dialogue,the  situations,the plot twists, are all so predictably stale that you're not  sure if you've wandered into some three-digit channel at 3am. the basic  fallacy behind this movie is the &quot;what do you do with a dead  horse?&quot; answer: &quot;pump him up with air and he'll float.&quot;
B000000H3Z|5.0|totally awesome cd here.Great songs beneath the remains,mass hynosis,hungry,and lobotomy .along with the bonus tracks makes this  a high quality cd .Fast heavy and totally headbanging fun .get this is mandatory  that sepultura fans have it as well as metal fans in general its just that  good a cd.

B00000JCB2|1.0|Its amazing how many people enjoy this cd.. but its obvous to me that those people are nothing but sheep that are blindedly led by the record companies and radio stations and such.... limp bizkit is the most overrated  group there is and they're pointless lyrics which are nothing but rhymes  which have no meaning or history behind them... The only reason this cd  gets 1 star is cuz their best song &quot;rearranged&quot; is the only song  where fred durst isn't whining like a little school girl.. I think sarah  mclaughlin said it best when she said &quot;limp bizkit fans are young  males who get everything in life and for some reason still have a reason to  be angry&quot; which was incidented by the riots and woodstock.. i will be  surprised if limp bizkit lasts another year if they keep churning out the  useless gibberish like their past 2 albums.
B00000705Z|4.0|I bought this limited double edition in Germany, which includes a disc of 7 remixes, definetly being the kind of disc that incorporates the proper and true style of remix that is dance-club worthy, as opposed to the bunk  from the horrible &quot;Disco 2&quot;. Anyway, this album includes the  singles &quot;Single&quot;, ;-), &quot;Se a Vida e (That's The Way Life  Is)&quot;, &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot;, and &quot;Before&quot;. My  favorite tunes off of this un-widely received, underrated album are  &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, &quot;Up Against It&quot;, &quot;To Step  Aside&quot; (For the life of me, I can't figure out WHAT those children are  trying to sing about), and the disco-pop ballad &quot;Saturday Night  Forever&quot;. And now for the remixes, in which I am very particular in  choosing, I only like &quot;A Red Letter Day&quot; (having spooky backwards  lyrics, the B-side remix &quot;The Boy Who Couldn't Keep His Clothes  On&quot; (I haven't heard the original version of this interesting B-Side),  and especially &quot;Discoteca&quot;, which REALLY picks up speed near the  end, closing out this album quite nicely. Even though others gave this a  negative review, I think this double version is the one to have, as it will  grow on the Disco-Dance-Pop fan in time, one just has to give it a chance.  Get it today!
B000021Y74|3.0|Not as good as I'd been told, but innovative and interesting, and kept my interest.
B000002U9K|4.0|This being the Boys' 1985 debut, it started off a legendary string of British Disco-Dance-Pop hits, one after another. It includes the singles &quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;Opportunities (Let's Make Lots Of  Money)&quot;, &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot;, and &quot;Surburbia&quot;. In  my opinion, however, the underrated &quot;Two Divided By Zero&quot;,  &quot;I Want A Lover&quot;, and &quot;Why Don't We Live Together&quot;  should have been singles also, or better yet, instead of the aforementioned  titles. For the mid-'80's, this CD stands out as a decent effort from these  two music geniuses, as well as being quite photogenic, as evidenced in the  lack of song information in the liner notes, instead including numerous  photographs of this London duo. Buy it today!
B000002MZ6|5.0|I've listened to Mike Oldfield for 20 years and I was still not ready for this.  It's been a month now and I'm still smiling at all the little things I hear that make this CD so good it's scarey.  I just ordered 3 more  copies.  It's the best thing I could ever give my friends.  I just don't  know how he did it!  Sit down and listen and you'll be headed for a really  beautiful place.  Once you get there you'll never want to go back.  The  next thing you know you'll be smiling too.  Trust me.
B000002UZ4|5.0|This was my first Pet Shop Boys album, and about six months after listening to all of it's singles from 1985-1991, I decided I wanted more. So I proceeded to purchase all of their original material that I could  find, including the import versions of &quot;Nightlife&quot;'s three  singles with the mutimedia video sections. I had only known of &quot;West  End Girls&quot; and &quot;So Hard&quot;, a top single from 1990, before I  became hooked on almost everything PSB-related. I especially like the  inclusion of the singles new to this album, which are, the remake of U2's  &quot;Where The Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You), the  noteworthy-for-the-times &quot;DJ Culture, and the catchy &quot;Was It  Worth It?&quot; I like every one of the included songs (except for  &quot;Jealousy&quot;, it being the wrong kind of slow ballad), admittedly  some being slightly edited for album space. Four Number Ones's, people,  what other British group out there can include that on a singles collection  album? Bottom Line, here it is, get it today, maybe even two, for your  ultimate appreciation!
B00000JMQD|5.0|The best thing about this film in my opinion is the music score,most notably the scene where Dorothy is in the attic in Mombi's castle and she is forlorn,and the closing credits music.I have searched for years after  repeat hirings at my video store and found it at a video warehouse and  grabbed it!Does anyone else have a strange sentimental connection with this  mega film?
B000002UTK|3.0|I rate this lower than other PSB albums because of having too few songs, not because of the time span (it's almost an hour). This includes the singles &quot;Left To My Own Devices&quot;, &quot;Domino Dancing&quot;, a  weird mixture of a cross between yet another No. 1 &quot;Always On My  Mind&quot; and something called &quot;In My House&quot; (it being just a  remix-y addition to the middle of the single itself that appeared on  &quot;Discography&quot;), and the original version of the excellent  &quot;It's Alright&quot;, which I believe was recently used in a car  commercial. The alternate, but still great version of this connection with  fellow pop group Sterling Void is on &quot;Discography&quot; as well. This  also has a different version of the B-side &quot;I Want A Dog&quot;, the  more superior-sounding of which is featured on the double collection  &quot;Alternative&quot;. Anyway, not a bad job from the Boys, I still think  one should look to &quot;Discography&quot; for more quality material. Fair  and so-so.
B00001SIES|5.0|What do you get when you cross the voice of Thom from Radiohead with the deep, sometimes haunting songwriting of Nirvana? Muse. This CD is an incredible CD from start to finish. There is a feel of Radiohead in their  music, but they're not over-run by it, they make their own distinctive  sound. From the acoustic Unintended to the latin guitar on Muscle Museum,  this is probably my favorite CD and I recommend it to anyone that wants to  hear a fabulously done cd.
B000001ESF|4.0|I bought this album (the original, non-remastered version, actually) in a small trading-post style shop in northern Maine for 3 dollars. And it was one of the best deals in music that I've gotten in quite a long while. I  especially appreciate the presence of the full whole entire studio version  of the classic &quot;2112&quot; epic, as well as the studio version of  &quot;A Passage To Bangkok&quot;, which I feel is better than the obscure  live version off of the &quot;Chronicles&quot; collection. I admit that I  haven't heard the other four songs yet, but I will perhaps try to run this  album in it's entirety real soon. Anyway, for fans of cool classic rock,  get this CD, you'll enjoy it for sure!
6304196938|5.0|This movie is suprising because if you expected the &quot;39 Steps&quot; type of movie because it's Hitchcock you won't know what hit you.  The Humor is added just by the twitch of Cary Grant's eyebrows and his deadpan  approach. Casting was perfect here, because without Grant, it would just be  another &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot; movie.  On the entire list of top  100 movies of the century I think this was well deserving of every vote it  got.  When you watch it, look for the many movies that have drawn from it's  Themes and even copied the dialogue.
B000002UWL|5.0|This CD, bringing the Dance-Pop Duo into the '90's, includes only three singles, the full whole entire &quot;Being Boring&quot;, &quot;So Hard&quot;, and the sappy, mediocre &quot;Jealousy&quot;. I feel that the  non-singles are what makes this album truly great, with the underrated  titles &quot;This Must Be The Place I Waited Years To Leave&quot;, the  decent slow-dance ballad &quot;To Face The Truth&quot;, the catchy  &quot;How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously?&quot;, &quot;My October  Symphony&quot;, and &quot;The End Of The World&quot; all being tragically  overlooked. I feel that this is my favorite of the &quot;regular&quot;  albums by the Boys from the '80's, with &quot;Nightlife&quot; being my  favorite from the '90's. Buy this great album today!
B000003BEV|5.0|The Sgt. Pepper argument is moot anyway, because anybody who knows anything about 60's music knows that Paul McCartney has repeatedly admitted that he and John Lennon got the idea for Sgt. from listening to the Beach  Boys' PET SOUNDS. Sgt. Pepper went on to inspire this Stones album, which  inspired the Monkees to do HEAD, which inspired the Bee Gees to record  ODESSA, and so on and so on and so on.... Don't miss this album...it is  truly one of the Rolling Stones' finest.
B000002UD7|4.0|This album, I think, includes a good number of very listenable synth-based dance-pop, some more low-key than others, but still nice to hear a few times over again. It includes the singles &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve  This?&quot; with the late Dusty Springfield, &quot;Rent&quot; (a slightly  different version), then on &quot;Discography&quot;, their number one  &quot;It's A Sin&quot;, and a completely different,  not-as-good-as-the-one-from-&quot;Discography&quot; version of  &quot;Heart&quot;, yet another No. 1 hit. The underrated &quot;One More  Chance&quot;, &quot;Shopping&quot;, Hit Music&quot;, &quot;I Want To Wake  Up&quot;, and &quot;King's Cross&quot;, could also, or should have been  singles as well, I feel. A great dance album (in some parts), buy it today!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album is still a delight to listen to over 20 years after its release.  It's combining of musical genres along with its decidedly punk attitude make it the pinnacle of a great career.  The line in &quot;London  Calling&quot; says it best: &quot;Phony Beatlemania has bitten the  dust.&quot;  I believe The Clash were the opposite of the Beatles in that  the hysteria surrounding them was in their music, not in the audience.   They were the best in their field and this album proved it.  From  exquisitely done reggae on &quot;Rudie Can't Fail&quot; to painfully sweet  jazz on &quot;Jimmy Jazz,&quot; the Clash showed themselves as musical  chameleons, whose every skin was more beautiful than the previous one.  The  chemistry between the voices and guitar playing of Mick Jones and Joe  Strummer is a thing of legend, and with good reason.  The intensity of the  band was so great, that in the early-80's when they were poised to be the  biggest rock group in the world, they exploded instead, making theirs one  of the truly great rock stories.  This album is a must-have for anyone who  professes to understand punk, and even rock music for that matter.
B000024QML|4.0|I now know that this excellent Pet Shop Boys album has recently been re-released, but I own and am now reviewing the original version in the Lego-like bright orange case, unfortunatly, I was not able to acquire the  limited-edition companion &quot;Relentless&quot; which includes six extra  new songs that I have only been able to read about so far. Why, I wonder,  wasn't &quot;Relentless&quot; also reissued and re-released with  &quot;Very&quot;? Hopefully someday it will be available again. Anyway,  back to this current album's material. It includes the singles &quot;Can  You Forgive Her?&quot;, &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Mad&quot;, and the  Village People cover &quot;Go West&quot;, which I like a lot better. This  isn't the '70's anymore, remember that! Also, tune in after &quot;Go  West&quot; ends, about half a minute later, a short, sweet, and sung by the  keyboard-genius Chris Lowe bit is heard, which could easily be called  &quot;I Believe In Ecstacy&quot;. My favorite's on this CD would have to be  &quot;I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind Of Thing&quot;, &quot;Dreaming Of  The Queen&quot;, &quot;One And One Make Five&quot;, and &quot;One In A  Million&quot;. Rolling Stone Magazine was correct in calling this one of  the &quot;Essential Recordings of The '90's&quot;. I fully agree. Buy it  today, it's best recommended for dance-club playings!
B00000J7J4|5.0|An excellent CD!  I enjoy this CD immensely. Great collaborations with such artists as Rob Thomas, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, and so on.  A personal favorite of mine is &quot;Maria, Maria&quot;.  This CD is well  worth every penny.  Who could deny that Carlos Santana is one of the  greatest guitar players of all time?  Here's proof.
B00000K19E|5.0|Yes, the story has holes...good heavens, does it have holes.I'll contribute one among many here: blocking out the sun would, uh,pretty much kill off all life on Earth, artificial or otherwise.  I would say ESPECIALLY otherwise.  :) <br />But anyway...violations of even the simplest principles of thermodynamics and physics aside, this movie is startlingly enjoyable.  Absolutely wonderful special effects, a fantastic cyberpunk atmosphere, and a nice enough story if you're willing to shut down a section of brain or two in order to allow the needed amounts of suspension of disbelief to kick in.  It also doesn't hurt that Carrie-Anne Moss is absolutely stunning...it's hard to imagine a better, more heart-stopping actress for the role of Trinity.<br />All in all, a fun ride, especially on DVD.
B000002H97|5.0|The first song I ever heard by Metallica was  &quot; Nothing Else Matters &quot;, I can say that I was honetly hooked by the song the second I heard it.   The Black Album is superb, from songs like The Unforgiven to Nothing  Else Matters to Wherever I May Roam, Enter Sandman and  Sad But True this  album displays the raw genius that Metallica has. If you can listen to  Nothing Else Matters and not feel some of the pain that the band is  expressing over the death of former Bassist Cliff Burton than you aren't  really listening to the song.  The song is beautiful and from that hammers  right into Of Wolf and Man.  This album shows Metallica's innovative  signature sound and intensity while also displaying that for all their  ferocity they can write a ballad as well, if not better than anyone else.   If you are a Metallica fan and for some reason don't own this album it is a  must have.
6305627401|2.0|Definitely over the top...too much so.  Watching this silly movie feels more like watching a couple of immature kids wreaking an equally immature form of vengeance once given the smallest ability to do so.  The swearing  and off-color humor is so overdone that it borders on ridiculous, and it  doesn't have to offend your sensibilities for you to think so.  I agree  with an earlier review; I think the twins have run out of steam, and more  specifically, out of things to say.  This movie seemed to be an  hour-and-a-half snub at the ratings boards.  <br />And I have to say that the  music is nothing special either, unless you're into novelty/off-color  songs.  <br />This is a pretty silly movie that, while it does still display  some of the subtle, witty social commentary I used to enjoy in the tv show,  still buries itself with its own attempts at shock value.  Disappointing  overall.
630516889X|5.0|Predator is definetly one of the most enjoyable sci-fi action movies of all time.  It came out before everyone turned to the cheap thrills that freak you out the first time and leave you bored the next (since you  already know what's going to happen.)  It's just all out fire power,  explosions, action, and of course, Schwarzenegger.  Who could ask for more?  Well, a couple things maybe.  Besides the amazing sound, I think the  picture could have been cleared up just a hair.  It's like a 4.5 out of 5.   Even though 4.5 is awesome, that 0.5 difference is still noticable.  Plus  there's no fun features except a trailor.  A DVD isn't just to watch a  movie, it's to totally enhance it!  If you spend $10.00 more an a DVD,  there should always be something a little extra. Other than that, don't  even think about holding back and not buying this title.  It would be your  loss.
B000031WD8|2.0|Another one of thoose movies that have the same dumb teen plot.But more graphic   it reminds you of cant hardly wait' shes all that' fast times at ridgemont high ' its funny in some parts  but   at the end you wonder what was the whole point of the movie anyway.                                           if u are in to premarital sex  teen drinking and masturbation, you will love this low life film .  stupid movie
B00000DG1R|4.0|Anyone in their mid-twenties and older has to acknowledge Duran Duran as having *some* kind of influence on society; an icon of the glitzy 1980's.  If you listened to Duran Duran, you were already cool.This CD puts 19 songs  together that we all remember, such as &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot;,  &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Notorious&quot; and, of course, &quot;The  Reflex&quot;.  There is a style about Duran Duran that is memorable, and  even though one could think that a lot of their songs were mere fluff in a  big-haired, flashy era, they not only sang, but shaped the culture of the  day. (just think: you had to have heard some of these songs played at your  junior high or high school dances in the gymnasium!)If you fall into the  aforementioned age group, I feel that you'd have to listen to this CD, if  for nothing else, for the nostalgia.
0671027344|5.0|my friend lent me borrow &quot;perks of being a wallflower&quot; and told me that it was extreamly boring and wasn't her taste. well, i read the book and it wowed me. Charile is a great character and I could kinda relate to him. I go into a bookstore, look for the book, buy it, and carry it  everywhere with me. I bring that book everywhere. It's such a great book  about sex, rocky horror picture show, high school, friends, etc. It's truly  my favorite books of all time.
0425129586|3.0|Agatha Christie's &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is excellent. It is pure Christie mysteries: suspicion falling on everyone in turn, suspense, twisted plot and intrigue. It is ruined if it is given away, so read for  yourself!
B00000DMJF|5.0|After much thinking, I believe the White Album is the Beatles greatest moment. It has a mysterious sense to it especially Long Long Long and Revolution 9 which I love. Sounds great as usual with George Martin as  producer.
630575067X|5.0|After almost a year of anxiously waiting, Star Wars:  Episode 1 hit home video.  Although the majority of critics gave mixed reviews, The Phantom Menace was welcomed tremendously well, with box-office grossings of over  $500,000,000.  I can guarentee that this site will soon be filled with  &quot;I hate Jar-Jar&quot; reviews.  Although he did supply the movie with  comic relief, I don't think he fit in with the sci-fi genre.  Which brings  me to the only thing I didnt like about the movie:  It was too  child-orientatated, but I guess that was what George Lucas might have been  aiming for.  The special effects were mind-blowing, and the action scenes  were breath-taking.  It was well worth the wait.  All the actors did a  superb performance as well.  All Star Wars fans will adore this whole movie  (except for Jar-Jar Binks possibly).  Can't wait for Episode 2(and no,  Leonardo DiCaprio is NOT going to be Anakin Skywalker).
044651652X|1.0|Robert J Waller botched his opportunity to make &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; an interesting novel. The book contains fascinating themes of  conflict including the struggle of choosing between passion and loyalty, and the difficulty of coming to terms with a mother's secret love  affair. Unfortunately, rather than exploring these themes, Waller makes  them the vehicle for a cardboard love story.<br />The hero, Robert Kinkaid  might have been believable if Waller had endowed him with human qualities.  Instead, Waller portrays him as a middle-aged superman: lover, artist,  pacifist yet war hero, impoverished, yet glamorous, lovable but  unavailable. His discourse is sometimes witty and often cheesy, but never  quite believable. I know that Waller wanted to make Kinkaid engaging and  appealing, but the resulting character is a two dimensional fantasy.<br />The  Heroine Francesca is a bit more believable when she expresses her erotic  feelings for Kinkaid and works through the dilemma over whether to run away  with him or to dutifully remain with her husband. Unfortunately, Waller  renders her character meaningless with vapid remarks about how Kinkaid  should go on without her because she'll only cramp his style. The  condescending manner in which she posthumously explains her love affair to  her children comes across as artificial, and insulting.<br />I think the film  version of &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; starring Clint Eastwood  and Meryl Streep succeeds where the book fails. Contrary to the book,  Francesca angrily accuses Kinkaid of being selfish and egotistical-a flaw  which he admits. Her objection and his subsequent admission provide the  relationship with more dramatic tension and make it more believable. The  fact that Kinkaid has his flaws makes him more believable and more  appealing. Instead of  being  insipid characters that introduce the story,  Francesca's children experience emotional conflict and character  development of their own. The revelation of their mother's infidelity comes  when each of them is experiencing a crisis in their lives. At first, the  shock and shame of their mother's affair adds to their troubles. But slowly  they come to terms with her affair and subsequently derive the courage and  inspiration from it needed to repair their own lives.<br />I might not have  given &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; a second thought and certainly  would not have wasted time reviewing it if the film version had not  revealed its failed potential to be a decent novel.
B00000099Y|4.0|If I could, I would put the first paragraph of this review with every album entry I see on amazon.com. Hey, music fans and others who appreciate art, at least TRY to behold all creative works on their own terms, whether  you think it's a piece of art or a piece of s**t. No, perhaps its not a  good idea to listen to Beethoven's Ninth or Metallica's Master of Puppets  just before listening to Tool's AEnima - or maybe for some people, it's a  great idea - the point is that, if one approaches a creative work expecting  it to sound or look like something else, 90% of the time one will be sorely  disappointed. Advice to others reading reviews: be wary of the extremes. If  someone says &quot;this is the greatest album ever made,&quot; don't put  too much credence in it; if someone rips an album, ask yourself why they  REALLY had such an aversion to it! - and if someone says &quot;this is not  real music,&quot; you can probably throw out that review for its snobbery!  Another thing that gets tiresome while reading reviews is when people  criticize music for its simplicity. Simplicity, in and of itself, is not a  valid reason to criticize something any more than complexity alone is a  valid reason to praise it.  <br />Hey, &quot;music fan from Texas:&quot; could  you try to be just a little less opinionated? One could easily say that  your strong aversion to this album is a damn good reason to check it out. I  did not approach this album as a Tool fan: in fact, after being a late '70s  and early 80s headbanger (Blue Oyster Cult, Accept, Riot, Iron Maiden,  Scorpions, early fan of Metallica, etc.) I have been mostly away from rock  &amp;roll for about fifteen years, exploring mainly classical and world  music. Then, one day, I heard the haunting strains of &quot;46&amp;2&quot;  on the radio, and later, the brutal frankness of &quot;AEnima&quot; (to  which I would think most people who've spent any time in LA could relate),  and was blown away by the raw power of this music. Istill love my  classical and world music collection, but now it feels like I've made  something of a homecoming to rock&amp;roll, and it's encouraging to see  that the &quot;heavy end&quot; of rock which (except for Metallica and  precious few others) appeared to be going nowhere fast back in the mid-80s,  actually was going somewhere, after all. I'm not a big fan of profanity in  music, either, but, taken objectively, words are sounds, and if  &quot;explicit lyrics&quot; add expression to music, then what the  hell/heck? Whether they ADD anything to the music or not is up to the  individual listener, but to dismiss music outright because it includes  profanity seems a  bit narrow- minded. Yes, every once in a while I catch  myself listening to a piece of music, and thinking, &quot;this is  music?&quot; - but really who's to say which sounds constitute music and  which don't? Apologies for my verbosity. Bottom line: Joe Bob says check  AEnima out!
B0000047EC|5.0|Pat Metheny and Charlie Haden are apparently close neighbours, well, that much is now obvious. These two masterful musicians have become one in a most wonderful way, so close that they're almost the same person.<br />The  recording has an earthy, very &quot;real&quot; sound to it, Metheny is  sitting over there, Haden just over there, and you're alone with them,  listening to these two masters entertain you. It is an intimate record, to  be listened to when you're feeling extremely comfortable for it to achieve  its maximum effect.<br />The melodies and chord choices are superlative,  generally I know where they're going to take the tune, but when they make  different choices I realise why they're in the league that they are. The  results can haunt me, lift me, leave me wondering just how they could have  made that melodic line so perfect.<br />It is not at all provocative, it  doesn't jarr the senses in any way. It soothes and relaxes as it passes by.  If there has to be any criticism of the record it cannot be directed at the  musicianship, which is of the highest order. A number of similar-sounding  tracks can eventually coalesce in the memory, and that is a problem here,  there are peaks of pleasure and plains of placidity, but they're subtle,  and the musical landscape ends up looking rather like the sumptuous cover  art.<br />The only recording niggle I might direct at the recording is that  some of Pat's more percussive acoustic notes come awfully close to  distorting the recording on a couple of tracks. Depending upon my mood  these sometimes enhance that &quot;two masters in your living room&quot;  effect, and at other times I'll feel that they're intrusive.<br />As soon as I  bought this album and found such beauty I passed on a recommendation to a  friend with similarly avant-garde tastes in other areas (I regularly listen  to Bill Nelson, David Torn, Fripp, Russell Mills, Allan Holdsworth etc but  appreciate Metheny's tremendous musicality nonetheless).My friend was  immediately captured by the same spell. In the years we've known each other  he's never used the word &quot;beautiful&quot; to describe any music he's  ever talked about, except for &quot;Missouri sky ...&quot;.
B00000JMQC|5.0|I caught this movie on the Disney Channel and it really freaked me out. I was thinking it was going to be on the lines of the original but this is a grand example of how the times have changed. An extremely dark film, actually feels more socially realistic than the classic original. Return to  Oz felt like a post-apocolyptic Oz movie. The incredibly freaky atmosphere  made me cringe with excitement. However, the ending left me a gritty  feeling in my mouth. I wish there was a sequel!
B00000255X|5.0|This album has two ingredients all the other Dylan albums lack: Emmylou Harris singing back-up vocals and Scarlet Rivera playing the violin. I love all of Dylan's albums, but this is my favorite of all time, mainly b/c the  addition of emmylou and scarlet make this so much different (but still as  good) than his other albums. The songs have a melancholic sound that isn't  duplicated this well on any of the others. This album has another unique  feature, Dylan co-wrote some songs with famed writer Jaques Levy. One thing  that will catch your ear is that Emmylou's vocals give the songs haunting  overtones. Add in the violin and its just an amazing sound. The songs I  like the best are &quot;hurricane,&quot; which is a great upbeat story  song, &quot;One more Cup of Coffee,&quot; and &quot;Oh Sister&quot; both  which are slower and eerie. Also &quot;Joey&quot; an 11 minute ballad about  mobster Joey Gallo's death. And it ends with &quot;Sara&quot; which he  wrote for his wife (ex?).  I didn't know what to expect when I bought this  CD, but I was in no way disappointed.
6303674984|5.0|The Gettysburg Collector's Set<BR> Gettysburg Is By Far The Best Movie That I Have Ever Seen. It Is Quite A Lengthy Movie But It Is An Excellent One. <BR> An All-Star Cast And Superb Re-Enacment Make This Movie A Must  See For Anyone Interested In The Civil War, Or Just Looking For A Nice Long  Movie.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This movie is for those who are romantic at heart.  It begins with somewhat of a domestic tragedy.  Kate played by Ryan was devasted when her fiance left her for a French goddess.  In a desperate attempt she flies to France in the hope of saving her love life.  While waiting to take off she  meet Luc and....you must watch the movie to find out.  In Paris everyone  falls in love...and you will too with this movie. French Kiss is a fun  movie to be watched with the one you love.  You will not be disappointed,  the scene of Paris and the French country side is beautiful.  Further  more...the music from this movie is great.  What are you waiting for go out  and buy yourself a copy, grab your loved one and watch this great film.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|When I first heard RATM, I thought they were a joke.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for political messages in a song, but the way their old lyrics read like articles from the back of a bad socialist internet 'zine made me  snicker a little.<br />This album is different. The band has really grown up.   They've learned how to couch their message in metaphore instead of  bludgeoning you over the head with it.<br />Plus they totally rock, which is  always nice.
B00000IPAX|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time.  Blink combines the vocal and instrumental harmony of well-written music with witty lyrics and a heavy sound.  Catchy tunes that you will love to learn to play or just sing  along.  THIS IS AN AWESOME ALBUM.  It is one of the few cds that I put in  and listen to end to end because there are no bad songs on it.  It has a  good mix of styles, all with the same Blink 182 sound from the older  favorites like Dude Ranch.  Even though you can get some of the songs on  MP3s, this album is still worth buying.  You will never stop listening to  it.
6301966015|5.0|I was a college freshman in '66 when I saw Blow Up, so I didn't agonize over whether it was art -- I immediately got a 35 mm camera and white jeans a la David Hemmings.  The movie portrays the intrusion of grim reality (a  murder) into the chic cocoon of Carnaby-era swinging London.   &quot;Something is happening and you don't know what it is...&quot; could  be applied to the confused hip protagonist as well as to the square  &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; of Dylan's song.  In this country, war, riots,  assassinations, and Altamont were about to intrude on the equally  self-referential and escapist world of the &quot;Woodstock nation,&quot;  leaving Blow Up as a beautiful memento of a more naive and innocent (if no  less deluded) time and place.
0793927501|5.0|Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin in an rugged, outdoorsy, life lesson learning film.  Need we say anymore?
B0000060NA|5.0|This album contains consistently the greatest music ever put to record. I'm not going to wax lyrical about this albums huge influence on all music since its release, I'm not going to discuss its merits relative to  Innervisions and Talking Book (the two other essential albums), all this  and more you should already know. All I want to say is that I can't believe  there are reviews here which give this album anything less than five stars.  Take no notice. Every single track is vital to the album, vital to you, and  vital to the history of popular music. Incidentally, the last few minutes  of 'Isn't she lovely' contain the most perfect instrumental solo ever  recorded - up there with Lee Morgan's trumpet solo on Moanin'. Anyway,  that's all. If you haven't heard this album, your ears are being wasted and  should be donated to someone deserving immediately. Change your life - buy  this.
0345350499|3.0|This book was disappointing to me. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in, but I was expecting transcendent literature and I got only a fairly entertaining fantasy tale. I think the author tried to cover too  large a scope; as soon as you got interested in someone's story it was over  and on to the next person. I found the characters somewhat fake too; some  of them were one-dimensional and others were too abruptly transitioned  between attitudes/behavior to be believable. There was a ton of telling in  this book and not enough showing. The plot was moving, though confusing at  times, and there were moments when I seemed to glimpse the idea of the  larger destiny unfolding against the character's wills. But the writing was  repetitive (how many times do we have to hear over and over again, \\"There  were so few left who had been together when we were young?\\"), the excessive  foreshadowing ruined much of the suspense for me (though perhaps most  readers would already be familiar with the Arthurian legends and suspense  would not be an issue), and the ending seemed to be a forced show of  hopefulness when the events as told were just plain tragic, in my mind, or  would be tragic if I had been made to care for the characters more.
B000002U82|1.0|This album is musically inane, boring and void of all interest for any but the most drugged out and vacuous of listeners. Please don't just kow tow to the ignorant masses who have been inculcated with the opinions of those  evil beings who think this poor display of non-music passes for anything  remotely near a classic. shameful. avoid this one.
B000020617|5.0|This CD is an amazing piece of work. The Foo Fighters are the best band to come out of the 90's since the Smashing Pumpkins. Dave Grohl is a musical genius. Those fools who keep comparing Foo to Nirvana need to stop doing  so, because there is no comparison. Cobain should never have led Nirvana.  Grohl has much more talent and could have made Nirvana not only the  marketable band it was, but a respectable one as well.
B000001FJV|5.0|James Brown - Godfather of Soul. What are they talking about? It should be: Godfather of FUNK! And this album is not only one of the most important in the history of music, but, unlike many so called 'important' albums, it  is actually fabulous to listen to and to groove to. Make it funky. Buy this  album. Invite your friends. Hell, invite your enemies too...
B00003003R|3.0|To quickly sum it up, this is great cd BUT, the only good songs are on Appetite For Destuction (the 1st cd) which you can get for 10 bux!  That cd is a five!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Oh yeah, what an album. No CD collection is really a collection without this album. If you don't own this then it means you have no regard for our musical culture, our heritage, or even for music itself. Songwriting has  never come so naturally direct from the soul - a natural woman indeed.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I first heard this when I was at my friends house and I just loved it. I then went to the store and I picked it up. This cd combines cool lyrics and heavy sounds. They sound nothing like Korn either. Corey is a good singer  who is full of rage which makes for a good album. Every track is hard and  it seems to get harder as the album progresses. If you like hard music than  this is definitely one to get!
6302038308|3.0|This one ind of scared me a little the first time i watched it. But now when i am down and need a good laugh i watch this movie.
079073639X|5.0|I don't know why everybody rated this movie so low. I'm a big SciFi fan, and I thought that a combination of great acting, moderately good special affects, and an excellent mystery plot that keeps you suspense till the end  was great.  Recommend it to anyone. See it once at least.
6302798450|3.0|Well this is not what i call a horror movie. I do like it alot but it's just not horror.
B000002C1X|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd album by far. Most people name Dark Side of the Moon as the best Pink Floyd album, but I strongly prefer this one.<br />This album is an incredible recording of a band which is at its  absolute peak in terms of musical perfection.  There don't seem to be any  moments in this ambitious album where the &quot;wrong choice&quot; was made  in regard to a note, a choice of instrument, etc.  Absolute melancholy  bliss.
0929541057|5.0|I loved this book! The symbolism Thurber uses is beyond what most could imagine.  I feel most everyone who reads this book will be able to identify with one or more of the characters.  We are all guilty of daydreaming at  one time or another and this book is a wonderful illustration of that.  I  also thought this would be a book most have never heard of, but to my  surprise the most important person of all (DonQ) knew all about it.
B000031WD9|3.0|Yes, the movie is funny and has some hilarious scenes. And yes, it could become the 90's version of Porky's. This could be a new brat pack generation too. But why should I buy this special unrated edition if the  extra stuff is barely noticeable? I feel that what I paid was too much. Go  for the normal edition and you'll laugh all the same.
B000002B7O|4.0|The first one('Blizzard')was great,but this is a work of poetry,intense,haunting,dark,and better than anything Danzig could ever hope to put out.This is the true follow-up to Black  Sabbath's'Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath'and'Sabotage'.The line-up for this one is  superb,while Ozzy provided some of his best vocals since'Paranoid'.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was great.  I read it about 10 times since March of last year, and I've never got sick of it yet.  Charlie's struggle with drugs sex and passivity is something that can really hit home with a lot of people.  Stephen Chbosky's work evoked all emotions, I laughed, I  cried, and I sat in shock.  I highly recommend this book to everyone,  especially &quot;wallflowers&quot;
B0000057C5|5.0|the verv popular german band rammstein appels to the younger generation with there german lyrics there most recent recording of a preformance in berlin with a full house but if you aren&quot;t fimillar with rammsteins  music dont start with the live album get stein such. out of there 12 songs  the most popular is du hast meaning (you hate)most people think this is a  bad song knowing that Eric harris and Dillon klebolt listened to this,in my  opinion this is not a bad song and this music does not influence vilance  and it is a good door to hard rokk and I recomend it.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Having first bought the LP of London Calling back in '80 and then purchased the significantly inferior sony/epic CD around '90, I'm happy to report that epic has manufactured a recording in '00 that is worthy of the  music it captures. The depth of sound and its clarity are much cleaner than  the original CD. Also epic has reproduced the artwork from the original LP.  Good job.
B0000028P8|5.0|Mariah Carey, with her softspoken voice and her strong-singing character, always manages to come out ahead.  This CD has been out for years, yet it still follows the times.  I love every song on here better than the  recorded versions.  She is always so much better in person.  This CD proves  it.  She talks to her audience and blends well with her background singers.   All in all, this is a CD that all Mariah Carey fans cannot live without.
6303020089|5.0|The last person summed it up well when called this movie the best ever.  I've seen a lot of excellent action/suspense/thriller movies, but this one takes the cake.  No matter how many times I see it, I still love it more  than any other movie.  Ford is an awesome actor, and he plays this role so  well.  But the way Jones plays his character brings so much to the movie,  that it would not be as good if anyone else would have portrayed the part.  If anyone out there hasn't seen this movie, they are definitely missing  something great.  I would rate it more stars if I could.
B000001FT7|5.0|Welcome to the Canteen shows the work in progress tour, that would later record &quot;Low Spark&quot; and &quot;Shoot Out&quot; albums. But unlike the lame subsequent tours for those albums as evidenced by the sleep and snore induced &quot;On the Road&quot; concerts(whether or not you have the original or expanded versions), this is truly the best of thier live efforts.<br /> Always an unsure band from its conception, Traffic suffered from a here again-gone tommorrow guitarist that would seem to jeopardize the bands efforts on the road up this particular concert/document which was a one-off affair.<br /> Earlier live concert documents of the early original band(Mason, Wood, Winwood, Capaldi) suffer miserably from the absence of Mason. This offering has a good song selection with the inclusion of Dear Mr. Fantasy, unfortunately the Spencer Davis Group songs are out of place.
B000007MVM|5.0|Needless to say something else..
B0000062GK|5.0|This really is Joe's best album. I think this CD is a must for any fan of guitar music and rock music in general. The best thing about albums like these are that even people like me who don't play the guitar can still be  amazed by the sheer technical wizadry and musical brilliance of Joe  Satriani. Keep rocking Joe....you simply are the best guitarist around no  matter what everybody else has to say.
B000006NPY|4.0|Since the days of Gish,I've always had a love/hate thing with The Pumpkins.My biggest gripes are a)the lyric try too hard to sound relevent &amp; clever all at once&amp; b)Uncle Fester..er I mean Billy Corgan  nasally whiny vocals.Since Adore is a more introspective ,quiet album  ,those two points come front &amp; center.With previous albums,it was easy  to overlook both due to the fact their signature buzzsaw guitars &amp;  crafty hooks prevail.But with this album,many of the lyrics just don't do  justice for these beautifully arranged songs.On To Sheila the scattered  words mar a very beautiful acoustic ballad,and Pistol Pete &amp; Dusty  sounds like vault material from Tumbleweed Connection.But what Corgan lacks  in words he makes up for it in his composition &amp; production  genius.Theres no denying the man's talent.The music he visualise in his  head ,onto our digitally encoded piece of aluminum is amazing.He can write  hard rock &amp; pretty ballads with a sense of balance according to each  songs needs,and that what makes Adore such a beautifully crafted album.It  seem that he has  more clarity in expressing himself in his music than his  lyrics.
6305609691|4.0|I gave my widescreen VHS copy away and bought this disc. It was clearly the right decision. I can't imagine anyone regretting the purchase of this DVD.<br />This disc's picture quality and sound demonstrate what ought to be  done, but usually isn't, to some of the older classic movies now appearing  on DVD. Sound has been remastered into full Dolby Digital. Picture quality  is so fine it's difficult to believe that this could have been better  experienced in the theater.<br />The obvious companion piece to this is the  documentary of the making of the film by Coppola's wife, &quot;Hearts of  Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse&quot;. If you haven't seen that, you  need to. It's a fascinating piece even if you haven't seen Apocalypse  Now.<br />There are a couple of goodies on the disc, including an alternate  stand-alone ending of the airstrike coming in on the Kurtz temple and some  excerpts from the original theatrical program, but this is nothing compared  to all the goodies you can get by watching Hearts of Darkness. <br />Knowing  about all that extra information and some deleted scenes shown in Hearts of  Darkness, I wonder why some of that material (indeed, why not put the whole  documentary on the disc, or make it purchasable as a double set?) wasn't  included on this disc. For that reason, I refrain from a fifth  star.<br />Quality of the movie itself and quality of the transfer to DVD are  surely five stars, however. Perfect.<br />On a completely irrelevant side  note, it would be nice if Coppola pulled a George Lucas on this film and  rereleased it with some digital enhancements, such as the addition of the  extra choppers he wanted in the chopper attack scene and a redoing of some  of the awful artificial shadowing on Brando's face in the ending scenes.  (Hell, you could even give Brando the body he should have had, looking like  the kickass soldier he was written to be instead of an indulgently fat  actor.)
B000006YMN|4.0|&quot;I Stand Alone,&quot;  recorded by Swedish-born Agnetha Faltskog, formerly of ABBA, and produced by American artist Peter Cetera, has to be THE best post-ABBA solo release in my opinion.  All the cuts are beautiful.   Agnetha really poors her heart and soul into each one.  My only complaint  might be that in places, it is rather over-produced, or a little too  &quot;slick&quot;  for lack of a better word.  On songs like &quot;Love In  A World Gone Mad,&quot;  which is ok, Agnetha nearly gets drowned out on  the chorus by the background singers.  &quot;We Got A Way,&quot;  the token  hard rocker, which is pure California (the album was recorded in Malibu)  all the way, is rather guitar-laden.  And I mean heavily!  However, all  that aside, &quot;The Last Time,&quot;  &quot;Little White Secrets,&quot;   &quot;I Wasn't the One,&quot; which is a duet with Peter Cetera, &quot;Love  In A World Gone Mad,&quot;  &quot;We Got A Way,&quot; &quot;I Stand  Alone,&quot; and &quot;Are You Gonna Throw It All Away,&quot;  sound very  heartfelt.  I could do without &quot;Maybe It Was Magic,&quot; &quot;Let It  Shine,&quot; and &quot;If You Need Somebody Tonight,&quot;  but I don't  like ballads all that well.  If you like soft stuff you'll love these three  tracks. Overall, you should buy this album, because it's probably any of  the best of the post-ABBA releases any of the artists of the group have  released in about 17 years.  A true must-buy!
0684872153|2.0|This opinion is evidently heretical. I must admit to being only 150 pages into the book and am weary of reading how Dad spent the family's dole money in the pub (which has happened about 20 times so far)while his children  starve and die of pneumonia. The portrait of Irish poverty is gripping but  degrading in its constancy and pervasiveness.  Enough is enough!  The style  is flowing (storytelling style, not, great literature) and had the book  been written by anyone else, I wouldn't have slogged through the Limmerick  mud even this far.
B0000025BL|1.0|Wherever I go I run into two kinds of people.  Those who know very little about music who love this album, and those who know quite a bit and despise this album with every fiber of their being.<br />There's a reason for this.   This album is junk.  Tedious beyond belief, and capable of inducing a  monumental amount of eye rolling.  Sure it was a huge seller 20 years ago,  but so was &quot;Grease,&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and a host  of other bad albums.  Then again, no one has ever gone broke  underestimating the taste of the American public.
6305127689|2.0|4:3 ratio screen is very good transfer. However, wide-screen isn't really wide screen. it's a 4:3 screen chopped off from top and bottom. in other word, instead of having a whole theatrical picture, what you get is picture  that's been chopped up both vertical and horizontally. what we are seeing  is only 1/3 of what's filmed, which is even smaller than 4:3. somebody  cheated big time from paramount. setup menu is false leading. I want to see  entire wing span on F-14!  It does make huge difference on impact in  fighting scene.   movie this good must be done right. and while at it, make  it a anamorphic enhanced.
068484267X|5.0|I never wanted the book to end.  After I had finished it, I ran to buy the sequel 'Tis.
6305750750|2.0|I gotta come right out and say it: Jar Jar ruined the whole movie.  The long stretches of exposition, the sluggish pace of the movie (really, this is the slowest and least captivating of the star wars films), the  &quot;cute kid&quot;, the blatantly &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;  Chinese-archetype aliens, and unbelievably CHEESY revelation that &quot;the  Force&quot; is genetic... All of these things I could have dealt with and  had a good enough time for my money (and patience in line), but every time  that-frog thing is in the movie (and that's a lot!) I was just shaking my  head in disbelief.  Why? Why does it have to be this way?  The good things:  Ewan McGregor was an awesome young Obi-Wan, Liam Neeson carried himself as  always with dignity-even when pretending to scold a stupid Roger Rabbit  wannabe, and the fight with Darth Maul at the end has to be the best reason  to watch.  So all in all, I'm still looking forward to the next movie, but  this definitly is not going to be as worn out as my tape of the original  Star Wars, if I even decide to get it at all.  Sorry, kids.
0783235666|5.0|Although I don't think that The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film, it is probably my favourite of his movies.  I've seen the trailer for the film, and it's very humourous, and obviously Hitchcock wanted to have a lot  of fun with his audience.  The trailer suggests that the birds attack as a  response to all that man has done to them over the years.  It's an  interesting idea, especially since the reason for the attacks is omitted in  the film, which is one of the things that I like about it.  I like the way  the film looks at the reaction of people to bizarre events, especially as  some of the townspeople connect the arrival of the birds with the arrival  of Tippi Hedren as though she somehow brought this on them.  I didn't even  notice that there wasn't a musical soundtrack the first time I saw the  film, because the sounds of the birds attacking amidst the silence is  really effective.  The performers are good, especially Suzanne Pleshette,  and although I don't think Tippi Hedren was the greatest actress to appear  before a camera, I think she's better than most people give her credit for,  especially considering that the actors are secondary to all that is  happening in the film.  She looks great, and projects a certain detached  coolness, which is appropriate for the character.  The special effects are  good (condsidering the time), and the tension slowly builds with each  attack.  I particularly like the scene where Tippi Hedren waits outside the  schoolhouse, and the birds slowly gather behind her without her knowledge.   For me, this is a fun movie to watch, well made and very effective for its  purpose.  I've seen a lot of other suspense and horror films and they  generally don't stay with me.  But I have to admit that there have been a  few times when I have gone by a large group of birds perched somewhere, and  I've flashbacked to this movie and walked a little faster!

B000002OX7|5.0|I bought this album last March or April, and I've not onceregretted buying it. Every song on the album is a gem, cleanly cut andpolished. Sure, some songs get on my nerves (This Song is Over, Getting in Tune), but that is NOT to say that they are bad in musicianship.<br />This album contains many of The Who's best known songs, such as Won't Get Fooled Again, and Baba O'Riley, and I believe it sounds like their darkest album (overall, of course.) <br />The songs are well balanced on this album. You've got your hard rock anthems (Baba O'Riley, Won't Get Fooled Again, I Don't Even Know Myself,) you've got your minor, acoustic/rock pieces (Bargain, Behind Blue Eyes,) and so on, and so on.<br />With over eighty reviews and a perfect five star average, you know this album has got to be good.  If you're new to The Who, this AND Live at Leeds should definitely be your first purchases.<br />I feel this is their best album, and is definitely my favorite studio album by The Who. It's Part I of the great 1971 trilogy (Three classic milestone albums were released in 1971 - Led Zeppelin IV, Sticky Fingers, and Who's Next), and this is my favorite of those three. Part II would have to be Sticky Fingers, with the mighty Zeppelin ranking in at number three (Hey, it was a great album, but it's not THAT good, and it's a TAD too overrated)<br />Overall: Simply a great album with songs that never tire out as you listen to them over and over again END
0140189378|2.0|This had to have been the dullest book I have ever read.  I waited through out the whole novel for something to happen!  All it consisted of was some man leading a boring life.  Yeah I know it was called SEIZE THE DAY but  really, do we need to be put through the agony of hearing of someone else's  continuous problems that were all self inflicted?
0517543052|5.0|I first encountered this book when I was leading a very &quot;sixties-ish&quot; lifestyle. Good gosh! Every brown, full-capp'd page was a revelation! Needless to say it opened my eyes (and they're still  open). I'm going to buy and read this book again; so, this glowing review  is based on a reading of nearly twenty (sigh!) years ago. I'm sure I'll  still love it, though.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I am so glad to see the re-release of this set.  I already own it, but plan to buy another just so that I won't have to be without it when mine is scratched or broken from overuse.  This set spans all eras of Marley and  his different music styles.  There are too many songs to list, and every  week I have a new favorite of the four CD's.  I still listen almost  everyday and I have had the set for about five years.  It never grows old.
0195102681|5.0|Yes, there is a lot of math in Mas-Collel's book. so what ? Math is a language that everyone should be able to understand.  If you dont like the book, that's ok. But be sure you understood all the book before writing a  review.
0786860707|5.0|Equivalent to a Holy relic, this masterpiece of a book has inspired me, not only to appreciate Disney's work, but also the animators and animation in general. If you are considering entering the animation field, in  particular working for Disney, then by all means purchase this book and  read it thouroughly. 2 of the Old Nine Men, Ollie Johnston and Frank  Thomas, wrote this book sometime in the early eighties. I read this in the  early nineties. I was such a good read it amazed. Not only what they were  writing about, but how good the writing was. It was humerous, witty,  profound and informative in such a way that is easy to retain the knowledge  which I found immediately applicable. By far the one book that has stood  the test of time beyond all of Disney's &quot;The Art of (Insert Movie  Here)&quot; books. Thomas and Johnston give step by step process of how  Disney complete a picture from the inception of the first idea to the  finalized product on Sunset Boulevard at the El Capitan. I cannot comment  on this book enough and cannot reccomend this book highly enough. Five  stars is the max, but I can say, of all the books I have read, no other  book has inspired me more in my readings, and no other book I treasure more  than this one. I say, the earlier edition of this book may have better  prints and color, but its not the pictures that matter completely (however  nice they are), its what the animators pass on to another animator.  Inspiration for motivation and creativity.

0790734249|5.0|To those who criticize this movie for not staying true to the original screenplay or the actors lack of authentic accents, I say, take it for what it's worth...and it's worth a bundle!  I'll never forget what cinematic  experience this was to see in a large-screen theater with great sound.  At  the time, I thought it was the greatest movie I'd ever seen.  There's no  way that the small screen can match that, but all the strengths are still  there: great acting, great period detail (except for the accents), a GREAT  soundtrack, and how about the opera scenes!   I'm not an opera fan, but I  think if I could see one in person staged like that I certainly would be.   Perhaps the strongest part of the movie is the contrasting lives of the two  main characters, and the poignancy of Salieri's torment with his own  mediocraty when he compares himself to Mozart.  It' something that I'm sure  that many of us mediocre souls have struggled with, so there is a strong  identification with this tragic character. Ironies and poignancy abound,  and combine with the music to paint a masterpiece of cinema.  I don't own a  lot of movies, but I wouldn't want to be without this.

B000023VTQ|1.0|If you took all of the dirty jokes out of this stupid movie it would be ten minutes long.  This is a disgusting, and lame movie.  Who would run into a mega-movie star and spill orange juice all over her and then say  &quot;it was surreal&quot;.  There was probably four funny parts that I  remember and the rest was sick (underline the word &quot;sick&quot;  please).  Hugh Grant is a drip, and Julia Roberts has a lot of talent which  was completely wasted.  I would have minused it 10, but the computer  wouldn't let me!

630575067X|1.0|The movie had nice special effects, there I said it. But the rest of this was an insult, fart jokes, stupid characters, lame plot points, bad bad bad acting, and overall just a horrible script.  The direction of this movie  was a joke, obviously they shot a couple takes then assumed the special  effects would distract the audience from this ungodly mess.
068484267X|5.0|This book teaches you that you really have it better than you think that you do. Just imagine if you had to live like that. Most of us have never had to live with a brother or sister dying let alone three. How many of us  in this country have had to go with out food or live in one room? How many  have had to go without shoe to wear to or had to make sure that there were  no fleas in our bed? There have not been as man of us begging so that our  kids can have something to eat or shoes on their feet or a bed to sleep in.  This bool helps you to really see what we have and how lucky we are that we  live in a warm house, with shoes on our feet, food in our belly, and  healthy and happy kids at our feet. Also this book gives me more  appriciation for my mother and everything that she did for us. Frank's  mother did somethings for them,but, other things that should have been done  she never did. She relied on the kinds of strangers a little TOO much. The  things that she did with her cousin is outragous. There is nothing that  would cause me to do that. I would rather cut my arm off, than have to  sleep with someone, let alone a cousin of mine, to keep a roof over my kids  head. I would have found another way to live.

0899661270|5.0|This book has been described as one of the greatest Regency romances of all time. It subtly and with cracking good humour subverts all the expectations of the genre with a great deal more subtlety, humour and  cunning than most deliberate parodies. Heyer builds up her usual cast of  powerful and memorable characters - no two-dimensional characters for  her!<br />She gives us a vain and slightly selfish, yet also totally generous  and completely charming heroine, who you cannot dislike; a delightful,  stammering and ineffectual dandy who turns out to have gumption beneath his  affectations, his lovely, silly sister with no fashion sense, but a great  deal of kindness, a wicked rake who yet fascinates and interests us - a  cast literally of dozens of characters, all of whom are distinctively  portrayed.<br />There are no less than four romantic plots in this book,  interthreaded and interwoven out of each other with exquisite grace -  (hence the title - &quot;Cotillion&quot; - basically a gay little dance).  In less skilled hands this book would have become heavy-handed and  ponderous, exquisitely tactless. In Heyer's hands the book is light and  flowing, fluently written, complicated and yet not at all hard to follow.  It is a book for the fan of Heyer, and is best read after you have  cultivated a familarity with Heyer's traditional Regencies - for example,  Regency Buck. She subtly and wickedly subverts traditions she herself  established.<br />You'll laugh, you'll cry, your emotions will all be twanged  one by one. It is a very fine book. A very fine book indeed. I won't tell  you who the hero is, because it would ruin the book for you - but you won't  be disappointed. Cotillion is a happy book, written by Heyer at the very  height of her powers. It is not just a Regency Romance. It is a novel about  history - Heyer's Regency novels have, collectively, been described as the  most important set of books about the Regency middle and upper class  lifestyle ever to bewritten. It is a novel about real people. It is also a  novel about the Regency Romance. And it is also a seriously comic novel.  Read it. Preferably after you have read several others of her Regency  Romances (I recommend Regency Buck, Sylvester, Faro's Daughter, and The  Corinthian as the best examples of Heyer's traditional Regency - that she  subtly teased in this book), so you have the right expectations.
B000002UAU|5.0|First of all, the Rolling Stones are not better than the Beatles. But the Beatles are not better than the Stones either. So don't think you are right when you tell people who the best band in the world is... If you want to  argue, go ahead. But they each had their own style and it would be  pointless to try and compare these two groups. I hope this clears up the  matter. Oh yeah, this is the greatest Beatles album ever...
0800116917|5.0|I will see this movie any time, any place. It simply has all the elements of GREAT moviemaking - a superb cast, especially Anthony Quinn as the indomitable Aouda; all the visuals you could ever dream of; a story worth  telling; top-drawer scriptwriting and dialogue (many of the lines are part  of my vocabulary, e.g. &quot;My name is for my friends&quot; or  &quot;Lawrence, you must eat&quot; and on and on); characters that come  alive on the screen as people you can and want to care about.  And all the  elements are &quot;cooked&quot; like a sumptous meal into a utterly  brilliant film. The viewer is transported to the time and place of WWI  Arabia completely. To me, a great movie must make me want to wish that I  was there, not in the movie, but in the time and place of the movie. And  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; succeeds like very, very few others.  &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is the very definition of &quot;Epic&quot;,  with the feel of life, not mustiness.
6305177473|5.0|The Hayley Mills' version was one of my all-time favorite movies...and then I saw the new &quot;Parent Trap.&quot;  I love this movie!  From the opening scene with Annie and Martin (that handshake!) to the romantic  ending...sigh...it doesn't get any better than this movie.  Lindsay Lohan  is brillant as Annie James/Hallie Parker.  I loved Natasha Richardson as  Elizabeth James.  The scene were mother and daughter see each other for the  first time when &quot;Annie&quot; returns home from camp is haunting (I cry  - it reminds me of the late Princess of Wales and how much she loved her  boys.).  I love the Abbey Road scene and the photography session at the  salon.  Dennis Quaid is great as Nick Parker.  Elaine Hendrix is   wonderfully wicked...and Joanna Barnes as her mother - what great casting!   The hiking scenes were hysterical.  I can watch this movie over and over.   AND the soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks ever.  I love all  the songs.  Everyone loves The Parent Trap.

B00000DLVA|3.0|I listed to this after seeing that it was on Roswell, hoping it would contain the theme song (actuall, what I was looking for was the chorus to &quot;Here With Me&quot; by Dido).  Overall, it projects a very minimal  tone, with the artistic and computer-generated photography.  It also  contributes to that by having the lyrics written is small print at the  bottom of white pages in the second half of the liner notes, which may  either be seen as contributing towards that tone, or just making them hard  to read.  The disk itself is white, and contains only for words on its  face, also to this.  The music was very interesting to me, as previously I  had only heard baroque, classical, and romantic styles.  It was difficult  to listen to at the beginning because of the percussion, but after  listening to &quot;Explode,&quot; where the addressee dies at the end,  quite moved me.  I also realised that the way Nina, with no formal music  training, was the focal point, also contributed to its minimalism.  It is  very artistic but somewhat tiresome, as much of the strength comes from the  fact that Peter (composer) is a genius.  Good, but &quot;Life&quot; was  much better.
6305750750|4.0|The most anticipated (if not quite the best) movie of 1999 appears at last in your living room.  This crisp, vibrant reproduction, of what George Lucas would ideally have us all watching in the cinema is a great technical feat, and possibly the most colorful movie ever to appear on your little TV  set.<br />The digital production means that colors are so vibrant that the  galaxy we are transported to seems almost surreal at times, even on the  small screen.  Add that to sounds that we have all become familiar with  over the past 20 years (the laser blasts, R2D2, lines such as &quot;I have  a bad feeling about this...&quot;) and you have an audio visual experience  that is anything but a passive one.  The small screen version thankfully  does not show up the 'effects' to be just that, as with Titanic.<br />Somewhat  sadly, the storyline and particularly characterisation lacks a little, but  the familiarity with certain characters helps many fill in the blanks - it  is certainly a worthy introduction to Star Wars for a whole new generation  who instead of growing up with Air Hockey and Pong, grew up with Zelda and  Mario.
B00003003R|4.0|Guns 'N Roses Live Era 87-93 is probably the best sounding live album I've heard since Iron Maiden's live album (can't recall the title but it was recorded on a 48 track or some other ridiculously good equipment). This  sounds really amazing to have been recorded live. All the songs on the  albums are really good (well except it's so easy - I hate that song). The  only real mistake was not putting The Civil War and putting on November  Rain. That song is good but not really a good representation of Guns 'N  Roses. Overrall a pretty good album but it would be nice if it were a  little cheaper and had a few more songs (even though it is like 2 hours  long) plus it would've been nice if the booklet A)was longer - a lot longer  and B)talked about the music or Guns 'N Roses or performing live. It  doesn't.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Having grown up with most of these songs, I could not pass this one up. The songs on this disc are timeless, catchy and for me, some bring back memories. In the part of &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; where Phil sings  &quot;and the sound of your laughter...&quot; my memory inserts the  giggling of the creatures that was audible in the video.<br />This disc does  suffer from two *huge* omissions- &quot;No Reply At All&quot; and  &quot;Paperlate&quot; are not on it, presumably saved for a &quot;greatest  hits 2.&quot; The song by the new singer (&quot;Congo&quot;) is totally  unnecessary. Does it even deserve the label &quot;hit?&quot;
0440234743|1.0|I am disappointed that John Grisham could keep me so captivated with others like &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; and leave me so uninterested with this one.  Has he given up?  No suspense...no character development...YUCK!
B00000JL86|4.0|This movie has a lot going for it, Superb animation, memorable songs, the characters on the whole are very likable, though a couple of improvements could have been made. Starting with Anastasia herself. Who seemed a bit too  self centered for my tastes. Which is pretty common with female characters  in most animated films, but she in particular seems to be driven ONLY by  her own needs. Wanting to know about her past and finding her family is  fine, but it would have been nice if she had be shown to express concern  for, or helping out someone else during the course of the movie.  To this  day I still think the most enduring female character in an animated movie  has to be Mrs. Frisby from The Secret of Nimh. A character motivated not by  finding Prince Charming, but who's strife and hidden courage comes from  trying to save the life of her child. A character you truly feel for. I  really wish more characters could be written like that.<br />It would have  also been better to see more of why Rasputin hated the Romanovs so much,  which BTW makes you wonder, if he was out to obliterate the Romanovs  completely why didn't he go after the Grandmother, wasn't she one too?<br />I  do believe Anastasia is a really good film, if not perfect, and I recommend  seeing it. And after you do, check out The Secret of Nimh, which I think is  Don Bluth's BEST animated film!
B00000IL1K|5.0|WOW! I ordered this CD after viewing the PBS special &quot;EDEN&quot; filmed in South Africa. I was messmerized by the program and had no choice but to follow up. What an eclectic assortment by this waifish voice. There  were probably only two of the sixteen selections which did not lift me off  the ground. Unlike commercial endeavors like her &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber  Collection&quot;, this album is an absolutely artistic masterpiece!
0780623134|5.0|This is a movie you won't forget it for your whole life. Don't see it if you're afraid of remembering it forever. It is such film which recovers viewers' faith towards Hollywood.
B000001OAA|5.0|Supervixen kicks the album off perfectly, as time goes by you are taken to even greater levels and then gently released with Milk. From former to latter there is nothing but gold on this album. The music is performed with  great energy, the vocals are delivered beautifully from the luscious Miss  Manson, even the order of the tracks was well thought out.<br />If you're  looking for something to wear-out your music system then they don't come  much better than this.

006016848X|4.0|The first time I started reading this book.. I didn't like it and didn't finish it..<br />I started reading it again one-year later.. I finished it today and I think it's a good book.. Although it may not apply for all men  and women  but it helped me understand lots of things I didn't see before..   Especially the parts on how do men show their love and I really think its  True..<br />Read with a partner, I believe would be a very good way for better  communication between you two, also between you and other friends or family  members that you care about...<br />It's also fun to read.. and makes you  laugh  when you imagine the conversations or put yourself as part of them!
0880381736|5.0|Well I guess to actualy rate Dragons of Autumn Twighlight. You would need first to finish the cronicles and then rate them all because not only one is good enough. You have to read them all. They all rule, together, but  seperate their missing something.
B000031WD9|5.0|I liked this movie, because it depicts the life of real lifeteens in real life situations. It shows that some teens are perverted,and they get everything they want. The movie is funny and you can't get any raunchier than this!
0062502182|5.0|This book should be read by teenagers who are about to venture out on their own.  I stopped frequently to contemplate the passages that I had read and read them again and again. This book taught me that life is really  a journey and it is also what you make of it.  Follow your dreams/goals and  hold on to hope.  The results may amaze you. The Alchemist is the BEST book  that I have read in the past 10 years!
0062502182|5.0|This book is one of the best and greatest books I have ever read.. NO! It's the BEST!<br />It's a book that touches and moves your heart, and leaves you determined to do the best you can to make your dreams come true..<br />It  makes your heart scream: &quot; Ohhh yes I will follow my heart, follow my  dreams&quot;! <br />Actually I don't know how to describe how I feel about  this book!  The best I can say is..                  I LOVE IT! <br />Thanks  to my dearest friend who told me about it..
B00001ZUGJ|4.0|Not only is the matrix one of the bestaction movies of all time.  But this dvd is loaded with all kinds of cool stuff.  There is an actual screensaver of the matrix for those of you with a pc-dvd.  The digital sound is  neccesary for this one.  If you don't have surround sound GET IT!
B00003BE32|5.0|I thought the mixing of an symphony orcestra and heavy metal rock was impossible to mix and make it sound good, boy was I wrong, this is one of the most amazing concerts (instrumentally)that I have ever seen. I really  like their new song, No leaf clover, IT ROCKS !

I felt like there were some parts missing, there  were things I didn't understand...<br />The book is not really special if you  would talk about a very good and wise writer such as Paulo..<br /> I would  suggest &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; &amp; &quot;Veronika Decides To  Die&quot;.. ofcourse after you read the &quot;Alchemist&quot;
B000031WD9|5.0|this movie is great. It is so funny i laughed so hard this movie is alot of what you didn't see in the theaters there is only a few extra seconds of the pie part and the girl part and book part and sex part this is a perfect  movie for anyone over 17
6300181456|5.0|Sure it's silly...sure it's long...but this is a great movie.  I've loved this movie for years.    Julie Andrews is hysterical in her attempts to be a &quot;modern&quot;, especially when trying to find the right boss to  marry.  Mary Tyler Moore is the best as the rich girl trying to make it in  the real world (taxis don't take checks?)  Come on, how can you not love a  movie about white slavery in the '20s with singing and dancing!   This  movie really is a guilty pleasure.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Generally I hate to hear men sing (I know that kind of limits my musical options), but I actually like this album. It has a lot of pretty songs. I really like &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; and &quot;Chained To You.&quot;  It is very well put together. I like it much better than their first album  (though it was good too). Do yourself a favor and check this one out. A+
B000023VTQ|4.0|Notting hill was funny very funny a must for Hugh Grant and julia roberts fans. but sometimes it got boring in some bits.
B000002N3J|5.0|I really love this cd. It is full of Madonna's greatest hits. We all love her dance music, so sometimes we forget how great her ballads are. This collection gives us all a chance to listen to an album completely devoted  to her greatest ballads ever.  I also loved the newer songs that can be  found nowhere else (like You'll See and One More Chance). A+
B00000768B|2.0|To put it bluntly the worst songs ever made by ABBA are in this album but since this album has 12 songs to choose from there are still hints of future success of the group. At the time known as Agnetha Bjorn Benny And  Frida the group messed around with different techniques to find the perfect  sound for the group. Although not found in this album there are a few songs  such as :RING RING , ANOTHER TOWN ANOTHER TRAIN AND NINA PRETTY BALLERINA  show that this rookie group could go far if they worked more on their  melody. This is a reasonable beginning but not too flash. Definately not a  very good ABBA album but still they were only just starting out and the  albums after that pretty much showed how well they could be. Die hard fans  will love it but the rest of us stick to greatest hits albums to get the  better of the songs on this album.
B000001FYL|3.0|Jon tried to do something different on this one, and recruited some outstanding musicians, like bass player Randy Jackson. But the result is disappointing, because it lacks force and the song are all alike.
B00000I950|4.0|This is ABBA's major addition to the disco madness of the late 1970's. In addition some of their best songs came from this album. Songs such as VOLEZ VOUS , IF IT WASN'T FOR THE NIGHTS , AS GOOD AS NEW and THE KING HAS LOST  HIS CROWN are four perfect examples of ABBA disco but some of the lyrics in  this album are terribly childish and are not the best effort bjorn or benny  acheived. Songs like DOES YOUR MOTHER KNOW , and LOVERS are two such  examples but in any case they make it up with great music so as to turn  mediocre lyrics into an enjoyable song. Great album and a great effort

6304341849|5.0|My story is much similar to that of Mark from San Diego. It was &quot;Maurice&quot; that was the reason for me to become aware of the fact how the power of motion picture is above every limit. Back in 1991, when I  was an university student, I suffered from the total identification crisis,  spending long sleepless nights dealing with the suicidal thoughts and the  question who and what am I... like Maurice, who found himself trapped in  his own gayness, trying to find the answer on that eternal question: why  me!  I had terrible doubts in accepting myself as one of &quot;them&quot;,  just the thought of admiting my own homosexuality frightened me to death.  Then, suddenly, like a gift from heaven, this film was shown on TV on a  cold, january evening. After those two hours of watching it, I realised my  life will never be the same again. &quot;Maurice&quot; threw me into a  whirl of feelings, but in a way, I felt reliefed. No more pretending.  Today, ten years after, I am proud to be gay, living with my friend and all  those uncertainties, surmises and questions remained on the pages of my  diary...<br />I have &quot;Maurice&quot; on tape and watch it every now and  then. It still has a strong effect on me, even I know every dialogue in it  by heart. I watched another ecranisations like &quot;A room with a  view&quot; and &quot;Howard's end&quot;, but the both acts of James Wilby  and Hugh Grant are so persuadive here that this is almost an paradox,  having in mind that Grant is a straight male-sex symbol. The word that  comes to my mind first when mentioning &quot;Maurice&quot;, is  beautifulness. Maybe this was the reason it affected me in that way -  homosexual love is presented as something beautiful, romantic,  non-stereotypic, longing and truthfull. Another subject, strongly presented  here, is sacrifice of Maurice, who subordinated all his career and needs  just to be with a love he met in Alec Scudder. The end of the film is not a  real end but just a beginning of viewer's interpretation and his explaining  of question whether their love has made it through. It is left for him to  decide what happened after. I'd point out that &quot;Maurice&quot;, even  acting like some kind of a fairy tale, represents all types of man  approaching his own homosexuality and this hasn't changed a bit over the  history. Clive's tightness into straight-acting world and common-sense  lifestyle is just another sight of those gays who rather choose to get  married and therefore ruin the life of another woman who, in this kind of  relationship, can't be nothing but victim, trying to hide from the rest of  the world, but as for Clive, this turns out to be just a short-termed  solution. I have a strong sense that at the final scenes when Clive replays  all his tender moments with Maurice when they were together at Cambridge,  he is thinking: you can fool with the rest of the world, but you just can't  fool yourself. Then, Maurice, who decided to live the way that will make  him happy, no matter what the British Class system might think - it is a  step someone can take now a days, prepared to struggle and fight with a  confinement and intolerance of the straight-majority. It is true that being  gay is no more being considered as an illness or blasphemy, but things  haven't changed that much as they seemed to.<br />If you like  &quot;Maurice&quot;, then you're going to like the book, too. I suggest you  read it. It is one of the best descriptions on gay love I've ever read,  especially when you have in mind this novel was written in 1910 when noone  even dared to think about writing and mention this theme in a literature. I  only feel sorry that this review is limited to 1,000 of words, as here is  so much more to tell about... A great movie!
0790729989|3.0|I love the movie.  This article has nothing to do with that.  The makers of this DVD should be ashamed of themselves.  Only half the movie comes on each side, meaning that during the movie, you have to get up and flip the  disc.  That is just plain unacceptable.  A DVD holds 4.5-4.7 GB per side.   Long movies like Pulp Fiction have room so it is hard to believe that  Se7en, clocking in at at a measly 127 minutes has to be double sided.  Also  the widescreen VHS edition of Se7en contains a mini commentary and the  theatrical trailer.  It is a shame that the DVD contains neither.  This is  an awfully planned DVD, but salvages some merit in the fact that I still  like the movie enough to buy it.
0385486804|3.0|For some reason, our history books laud the explorers of the 19th century whereas the modern media classifies such similiar spirited folks as incomprehensible nomads.  A college boy renounces law school, a house in the burbs and a guaranteed beemer for what?  Berries in Alaska.  Freak, for  sure.  John Krakauer's chronicle of Chris McCandless' sojourn into  America's western wilderness digs deeper into the psyche of a modern age  explorer.  Kraukauer is not any less intrigued just because the geographers  have already named the northwest territories.  Instead, the author looks at  some individuals, both past and present, who long to discover the beauty of  nature that surrounds us.  The main problem with his subject however, is  McCandless' isolation.  History has etched romantic images of our great  explorers of the past.  We see them as social heroes who dared to cross  vast seas to find a better life.  Marred by this historical indoctrination,  we cant help but view McCandless as an aberration, as a disgruntled teen  who is looking for an escape versus a new frontier.  The novel reads very  easily quoting the classic words America's most famous naturalist writers.   I applaud his interest in this unique young man who, unfortunately, didnt  quite pack well enough for the great white north.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is definitely Enigma's best CD since their debut MCMXC AD (&quot;1990 AD&quot;) album.  While not nearly as meditative as that album, &quot;Screen&quot;'s songs all fit together better than the  wildly-fluctuating &quot;Cross of Changes&quot; and &quot;Le Roi Est Mort,  Vive le Roi&quot; (&quot;The King is Dead, Long Live the King&quot;),  making an excellent cohesive package (though still far below the standards  set by &quot;MCMXC&quot;).  This is a great album on its own, but we're  still waiting for a true sequel to &quot;MCMXC&quot;.
B000002OZY|5.0|This cd is unbelievable. My feeling is that you get more out of the album if you listen to it as a whole.  Listening to the story unfold is an amazing experience that I think anyone can appretiate.  Even if you don't  like  The Who, I think this is a piece of music that everyone should try at  least once.  The instrumentals of Keith, Pete, and John mixed with  Daltrey's vocals make for an &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;

B000002B49|2.0|I bought this thinking it would be along the line s of Delerium and Enigma. It's okay on the whole, but the ethnic singing is far too over the top. One track sounds like Nat King Cole gone wrong and others sound like  any old pigmy off the street has been hired to sing to a good backing  track. As a result it sounds like Paul Simon's African work, after 20  pints.<br />Track 2 is the best, but it's a shame the ethnic vocal parts are  timed to badly.<br />Get Karma by Delerium - it's 5 times better, but note  it's not as heavily Africa/Ethnic based.
0451191153|5.0|I stayed awake for 24 hours to finish The Fountainhead and will agree - it's one of the most powerful novels written in the 20th century. (And I speak as an Oxford MA Hons in English Lit, if that's worth anything, which I doubt.)<br />However, Rand was a deeply mixed up gal. She worships rapists.  (*All* the heroes in her novels are rapists - look carefully!) <br />She'd have swooned at Saddam Hussain's feet. (He is, after all, by her definitions a man of integrity, naked strength and moral courage - true to himself. Just as a hyena is true to itself.)<br />Rand's favourite characters are, as has been said elsewhere, psychopaths.<br />Her female protagonists in The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are, frankly, insane. Just as, I suspect, Rand was.<br />Look more closely at her 'philosophy', expressed in her non-fiction works, and it disintegrates into a babble of circular logic.
B00002E233|3.0|This is a fun movie. I really enjoyed watching it and the special effects are great. DVD definately brings out the best in the film. <br />This is a great movie to watch when you aren't looking for anything too  serious.<br />Although I am dissapointed that they didn't put LL Cool J's  video on the DVD aswell. In this digital age and with the extra options  they put on DVD disks you'd think they would use it for a better  interactive experience for the viewer.

B00000G6QK|5.0|I had this album on plastic but due to a miss-hap, I've spent the past 15+ years hit'n every record store /garage sale looking for this dyn-no-mite !  record. If you want to know what fusion is about, you must get this  disk. Cobham kicks a whole in your speakers and registers a 4.5 on the  earth quake meter!

B000006OBQ|5.0|Calling all Sinatraphiles....this is the one to have. A live show that puts you where you've always dreamed of being. With the backing of the amazing Count Basie and the production of Quincy Jones, how could you go  wrong? From the opening of COME FLY WITH ME to the energetic GET ME TO THE  CHURCH ON TIME this cd is essential Sinatra and simply amazing. This  version of I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN is the definitive version of the  Sinatra classic. With that song alone this cd is worth the price of  admission! The set is varied between high energy songs and soft ballads  which makes it even more of a value. Forget that Sinatra is slightly passed  &quot;his prime&quot; at the time at time of this recording....sit back,  sip your JD, and enjoy the ride!
B00000K3G8|5.0|I remember the first time I heard Talking Heads' version of Take Me To The River.  Thus began a long love affair with this band.<br />The newly remastered version of Stop Making Sense is an instant classic.  From  Byrne's entrance with a &quot;boombox&quot; and a guitar to the symphonic  climax of the aforementioned dip in the water, the band is visibly in its  prime.  The picture is as clear and crisp as Byrne's larger than life suit  in Girlfriend Is Better (I purchased the DVD too). The sound of each  individual instrument and voice is just incredible. Tracks 5-9 are a  seamless adventure through some of the band's best music.  By far my  favorite song on the whole cd is track 7, Life During Wartime.  If you buy  only one cd this whole year. . .buy this cd.  It makes sense to say there  will never, and I mean never be another band like this. . .and you can take  that to the River!<br />Chris B.

0684872153|5.0|From the moment I opened this book until the moment I closed 'Tis', the sequel, I was utterly compelled by Frank Mc Court's incredible honesty and writing. He writes not only about the events of his poverty-stricken Irish  childhood without over-emotionalising, but forces every one of us to  re-examine our own lives, and wonder: what's it all about? This book is NOT  depressing, it is enlightening, inspirational, moving. If you haven't read  it yet, I urge you - this book  will challenge, motivate and alter your  perspective on life. Get it, read it - and then prepare to go straight out  and buy the sequel!
B00003000M|3.0|The idea of this project was smart, however, it was not done with any kind of respect for bob's work. Bob Marley was not only an execellent vocalist, but he could play the guitar very well. Stephan Marley knocked off the  intrumental tracks on these and replaced them with a more &quot;urban&quot;  feel. Also, on the track Jammin with Mc Lyte, Ms. Lyte makes a reference to  Allah, to my knowledge, Bob Marley was a rastifarian
067101756X|4.0|THE DAY AFTER ROSWELL is the first `UFO book' I've ever bothered to read. I guess I'd never  really looked upon the whole `UFO thing' as being all that book-worthy. Granted, I've always seen the subject as an interesting  one. Let's face it, thousands of sane, credible people have seen things in  the skies that were more than `probably just Venus', but with the very  nature of a UFO being `unidentified', any book on the subject would have to  bring a uniquely informed writer to the table to keep it from being just  another speculative exercise on a highly speculative subject. Which brings  us to the author, Col. Philip J. Corso. Say what you want about the subject  matter of the book, or the tale the good Col. is telling, at least in Col.  Corso, the story is coming from a qualified source. A person who would have  known.<br />So what exactly is the story? Well, it isn't the `UFO agenda'  smoking gun the title had me expecting. In fact, it isn't at all what I  expected. Whereas I thought the book might be about actual  `EBE's'(extraterrestrial biological entities), where they may have come  from or what they might be doing here, the book hardly touches on any of  that. What it does touch on is how Col. Corso, from his post within the  Army's Research &amp; Development program in the early 1960's, went about  farming out bits and pieces of technology from a crashed spacecraft found  near Roswell in 1947, into ongoing Defense Department development programs.   As he tells his story, it was put upon him not only to think up different  weapons  applications for each little piece of crash wreckage he had at his  disposal, but to also put them in the hands of the right contractor,  working on the right projects, while at the same time not letting anyone  know where the technology was coming from. Nor could he let any of the  competing branches of the military know what he was up to. And it's here,  on this level, as the tale of a mild mannered military bureaucrat workingagainst the tense, cloak and dagger backdrop of the cold war, that THE DAY  AFTER ROSWELL ultimately worked for me. Basically the story of an ordinary  man put into an extraordinary situation. <br />I did have trouble with a  number of things in the book. Like the chance meeting Corso had with his  own destiny back at Fort Riley, or the lack of action taken on the `nut  file' by his predecessors at R &amp; D in the 13 years prior to his  arrival. And I must say, his account of his involvement in the Cuban  Missile Crisis left me feeling like I was watching a Commander McBragg  cartoon, yet none of these little problem points really affected the core  point of the book. On the overall, I still came away from it with the  feeling of. . . . . oh, I don't know . . . . . let's just call it -  plausible plausibility. And for a story as way out there as this one,  that's not too bad.<br />Is it the truth? Who knows. But one thing is for  sure, something strange did crash outside of Roswell New Mexico in 1947,  and it sure as hell wasn't a weather balloon.
B00000K2SE|5.0|The effects, the acting, and the storyline were more than exceptional.  Even though there aren't many movies with this kind of quality to compare to... I still think that this movie is an instant Sci-Fi classic.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is different from the last 3 albums, but it's great. All of the tracks are shorter than usual but are all well mixed. If you find yourself getting bored listening to this album at first, you've gotten too used their past albums. It's definitely as good as all other albums Enigma's released!

B000023VR6|5.0|With all the hilarious mis-matched interludes &amp; Dre's unbeatable flows, this CD never lacks energy.  The guest spotlights, including the likes of Eminem, Snoop, &amp; Mary J. Blige are also well-helmed.  A  must-buy in a somewhat lackluster year for big-name, oversampled rap  albums.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt has such an intrinsic writing style, that progresses as he ages throughout the book.  He takes situations and stories that would normally bring you to tears, and he leaves you laughing at the irony and  the matter of circumstance.  This book takes you back to your own childhood  and our mentality that was once innocent, but somehow becomes enhanced with  impurity and self-righteousness. Ancestry is such a gift that can only be  best explained by the people that struggled to get to where they are today.   Frank McCourt's story is a wonderful memoir that inspires its readers to  create their own destiny and work to achieve the goals we set.
B000009ED0|3.0|Although Kid Rock isn't deserving of his Best New Artist Grammy nomination, he sure knows how to make a mindless party album.  &quot;Wasting Time&quot; is the core of the fun--mixing booze &amp; weed  with a bouncy Fleetwood Mac sample.  The other radio hits have become  anthems--including &quot;God Only Knows Why&quot; which adds a much-needed  emotional layer to the album.

6304504012|4.0|Boy do people miss the point on this movie. You can't present a movie like a broadway show. Everytime this has been attemped, historically, the results are bad, most adaptions of famous shows are only OK at best, some  are awful.   The medium is totally different, the demands are different,  the singing is different, the acting style is different. Yes, the shows  usually are &quot;better&quot;, in a sense,  that's how it was originally  written, as a stage play. You have got to really change things to make a  successful movie. <br />So how good an ADAPTION is this?  Very good indeed.  The story was changed to very effectively fit the medium. Madonna stretched  herself unbelievably to do this role, and I think she did very well. You  may quite validly prefer the stage version of Evita (I like both), but its  almost like apples and oranges. As good as Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin  were, they would, if they played it the same way anyway, come off mannered  and absurd in a movie context. All the conventions of the stage would be  laughable. (unless it was simply, of course, an actual filmed stage  production). On the other hand, Madonna and Banderas are not nearly strong  and polished enough for a stage. Most of the changes (a few I don't  understand), make a lot of sense, when you consider how a movie has to  flow. <br />As for this movie not being deep or historical, its a musical for  Pete's sake, not &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; I don't know enough about  Eva Peron to really say, but I don't see how you could present a real  historical drama in a musical context. I think the problem is people don't  like or understand opera, which this essentially is. Most of the great  operas have ludicrous story lines! Also if you are going to go in knowing  you &quot;hate&quot; musicals, &quot;hate&quot; Madonna, then fine, this is  not to your taste. Banderas is not a polished singer, but his rough edged  singing is very appealing and effective in this context. <br />Thecinematography, costumes are outstanding, and serve the story well. Only as  the dying Evita, do I find Madonna not very believable. I think Evita is  thrilling, its one of my favorite movies of recent years.<br />I love the show  Evita, and I love this too, but in a very different way.
B000002H72|5.0|What can you say about the Pixies.  While they were together they were one of the most overlooked and underrated acts you could find.  This album is, I think the perfect example of The Pixies at their best.  Their songs are  at once atonal and melodic.  This band has been described as Nirvana before  Kurt Cobain figured out what he was doing.  In all honesty, that is not  such a leap.  There are a lot of style simialarities in song construction  and chord progression.  Some of the best tracks on Doolittle include Mr  Grieves, La La Love You (with a Morrisey cameo for any Smiths fans out  there), and my favorite Gouge Away.  These three really dont do the album  justice.  This is a complete record from start to finish.  If you are a fan  of one of the countless bands influenced by the Pixies, or of one of the  Solo Projects that Kim Deal or Black Francis (Frank Black) have put out,  this is the Pixies album to start out with.
6304698542|5.0|I have little to add to the above. I am glad that nearly everyone agrees this is one of the century's classic movies, musical or otherwise.  I might say this is one of the rare cases where the movie version is far superior  to the stage show. (Caberet, the show, is pretty hoaky by comparison).

A true classic.  Enthusiastically  recommended.
0783113145|5.0|The first time I ever saw A Bronx Tale I fell in love with it.  It quickly became my favorite movie of all time.  I go to West Virginia University and I made almost my entire floor watch it and all of them thanked me and said  that it was one their favorites as well.  De Niro proves that he can play  more than a tough guy in this movie.  I find myself reciting lines from  this movie very often.  I cannot wait to get it back from my friend to  watch it again.  Take an Italian's word for it, if you buy this movie, you  will not be disappointed.
6301161572|5.0|I got this copy of &quot;Il dissoluto punuto,&quot; ossai &quot;Il Don Giovanni&quot; for Christmas.  This was my first opera, and I am astounded.  I'm hooked on this style of entertainment, now.  Kiri Te Kanawa and  Ruggero Raimondi are the perfect opera performers to introduce you to  opera.  They both have wonderful voices and can act like nobody's business.  Enough about the main performers.    When I got this, I was expecting it to  be a film of a stage performance..  and that's not at all what it was.   These &quot;opera films&quot; are absolutely wonderful.  Kind of unusual  and take a bit to get used to, but are very nice.  Excellent film.  Great  performance of the scene that made me want the opera (Don Giovanni, a cena  teco).  I love the happy, bouncy quality of the marriage party, where we  first meet Masetto and his wife.  It's so Mozart!  I never really  understood the purpose of the valet in black. (O.o).  Mozart can be so  intriguing...  he was my favorite composer to begin with, and this only  increased it. Great opera to be your first.  I strongly recommend it.
B00003BDXG|4.0|Great film that shows us how we are only a part of nature and how society defines and views murder as some ultimate evil and not a part of us as humans.

Columbine being on all news  networks for weeks) and not caring about those involved and those left  behind.  Excellent, excellent film!
0800177177|4.0|I will start off by saying that Bram Stoker's Book DRACULA is amazing. It is easily one of the best books ever written. Coppola's film is NOT Stoker's novel, but it is the closest compared to other Dracula films. It  has a good cast, and Gary Oldman is magnificent as the Count. I especially  liked Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing.<br /> The film lacked in some areas where  other parts are dazzling. This is considered horror, but I can't say it is.  It seems more dramatic than horror. The special effects are good (except  for the blue flame part) and it has plenty of blood for you sicko fans  going for gore. Overrall, good, probably the best adaption of DRACULA to  date. But I do wish Coppola just called it &quot;Dracula&quot;, because  putting Bram Stoker's name on it is false advertising.

0517591812|4.0|This is a big, sprawling, initially intimidating (mainly because of its heft) but ultimately rewarding read -- a journey that follows several British families, from all walks of life, through 2,000 years of London's  history.  You'll start with the Druids and Caesar's crossing of the Thames,  and finish with The Blitz and a bit of modern arachaeology.  In between,  you'll watch history come to life (each chapter revolves around a major  event in British history), with the usual artistic embellishments expected  of historical fiction.  But it's all in the name of good fun, so don't be a  stickler -- sure, modern-day English didn't come out of the mouths of the  Tudors, but who cares?  Rutherford is, for the most part, faithful to  reporting events As They Really Happened and to Life As It Really Was.<br />While it's the Ducket/Doggett/DuQuette family that serves as the focus  of the book (keep looking for those folks with the webbed fingers and the  shock of white hair as you read), it's the City of London itself (and,  arguably, its architecture) which is the book's real showpiece.  Be  prepared to stick an extra bookmark at the front of the book where the maps  are, because you're going to need it.  If there was a Roman road leading  out a City gate, Rutherford has marked it in the text and you're going to  walk down it eventually, so get your bearings early.  The cast of  characters also grows exponentially through the years, as family trees are  wont to do, so keep the page of the family trees marked as well.<br />This  isn't a novel (as the cover proclaims) so much as it is a series of  vignettes linked by a constant (and consistent) narrative and cast of  characters, and Rutherford makes the most of it.  There's some  laugh-out-loud bawdiness in here, a dash of The Classic Chase (a la  Keystone Kops), a bit of high drama, a few nods to Shakespeare, and even a  bit of the Prince and the Pauper.  Rutherford makes good use of his time,  but there ARE instances when things seem to get wrapped up rather too  quickly and too neatly in order to clear the way for the next  chapter.<br />The middle sections of the book seem to move the fastest, which  makes sense, given the historical period this portion of the book covers --  the Glorious Revolution, the Civil War, the War of the Roses, and a peek at  a Henry VIII who's the biggest skunk you'll ever see this side of Richard  III.<br />There's also some real beauty in here, and Rutherford doesn't  skimp on the details of British life and living that really make the  book  come alive.<br />It's going to take some time to get through, and you WILL  find yourself thumbing back and forth between chapters, maps, and family  trees to keep everything sorted out, but it's well worth it.  Set aside a  week or so, put aside nitpickiness, and just enjoy watching Rutherford go  to work.hen things seem to get wrapped up rather too  quickly and too neatly in order to clear the way for the next  chapter.<br />The middle sections of the book seem to move the fastest, which  makes sense, given the historical period this portion of the book covers --  the Glorious Revolution, the Civil War, the War of the Roses, and a peek at  a Henry VIII who's the biggest skunk you'll ever see this side of Richard  III.  <br />There's also some real beauty in here, and Rutherford doesn't  skimp on the details of British life and living that really make the  book  come alive.<br />It's going to take some time to get through, and you WILL  find yourself thumbing back and forth between chapters, maps, and family  trees to keep everything sorted out, but it's well worth it.

0345423496|4.0|Many will read this book and decide that it was an appauling conclusion to the series - resolving nothing after all that time. They would be wrong. 2001 showed the begining of the Aliens experiments, 2010 showed the  continuation of those experiments, 2061 showed the failure of a particular  experiment, and 3001 shows the conclusion of their experiment.  There is a  tremendous amount of technological extrapolation and so many philosophical  musings that one cannot walk away from the book without thinking about the  concepts and issues presented. All of Arthur C. Clarke's novel have a kind  of open-ended conclusion to them and this one is no different. In reality,  the story never ends. Arthur sticks around long enough to make the point  and then leaves one to imagined the possible future that awaits us.  Note  that those of a profoundly religous nature may feel offended by some of the  issues raised (that the word 'God' is a taboo in the future), but this  amazing work certainly provides food for thought.

I had a terrible headache for a week after hearing that one.  However the Live Album was  great but it was rather sad that it only had 4 songs on it.  And when you  buy the CD version of it, it comes with a sweet poster, I liked it so much  that I hung it on my wall. Of course I didn't just get it for a poster but  you have been warned about Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered  Together in a cave and Grooving With a Pict.

A lot of other bombed  songs like Nookie and No Sex really makes this album junk.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is byfar the best book I've ever read.  It's so good I read it twice.  I loved it because Charlie reminded me so much of myself.  I know how it feels to be so wound up in crazy thoughts that you lose control of everything and try to hang on but after a while, you can't do it anymore.  I also like the way Charlie thinks.  I love the  way he questions.  A lot of 16 year olds I know don't do that.  They take  things the way they are and live with it.  Charlie always asked  &quot;Why?&quot;  And that's alright with me because you find out things  that way, I guess.  All in all, I loved this story.  It was very different  from everything else I read.  I'm definitely buying my own copy.

She asked me if I was going to attend her show at the Troubadour  later that night and I was fortunate enough to get tickets from the radio  station to attend the sold out show.  Her performance was eclectic and  powerful.  Her music consisted of electrical vibes with flavor of African  conga drums (for 'Slide' and 'Isobel').  I was in awe with her performance.  Although all her songs are amazing, my favorite is 'Honestly OK'.  To have  an opportunity to meet and talk to this talented and kind singer made be  very fortunate person.

B000002UAI|5.0|In America, the tracks on &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; were released primarily on two Capitol LPs, &quot;Beatles '65&quot; and &quot;Beatles VI&quot;.  The record companies or the Beatles themselves have not allowed,  at least for now, American fans to have the albums they grew up with in the  1960's on the CD format, instead providing the early albums only in their  British formats.  Considering the impact and remuneration the Capitol  American LPs had on America and for the Beatles, it's really a shame you  can't buy Meet the Beatles, The Beatles Second Album, Beatles 65, The Early  Beatles, The Beatles Story, Beatles VI, etc. on CD in America.  Even more  disappointing is that the early British albums are only available in  MONOPHONIC on CD, while the LPs had been released in both mono and true  stereo.  I have a copy of &quot;Beatles for Sale&quot; in stereo and it is  fantastic.  The album is filled with great songs and performances such as  &quot;Rock and Roll Music,&quot; &quot;Eight Days a Week,&quot; &quot;No  Reply,&quot; and &quot;Kansas City&quot;; even more great covers such as  &quot;Words of Love,&quot; &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby&quot;,  &quot;Honey Don't&quot;; and a few average songs such as &quot;Mr.  Moonlight&quot; and &quot;What You're Doing.&quot;  Side Two of Beatles for  Sale (on CD, this would start with &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;) is  especially enjoyable.  I think the problem with Beatles for Sale is the  order of the songs.  &quot;No Reply&quot; is a great song, but not really  the best song to open the album.  &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; might  have been a more appropriate lead-off track, and &quot;Leave My Kitten  Alone&quot; which was left unreleased for 30 years, should have been  included somewhere in the song selection.  I love this album, and suggest  others try switching around the song lineup on their CD players to see how  it completely changes the impact of the album.  Capitol did the same thing  when they tinkered with these songs and put them out on the American LPs,  perhaps not successfully either.  But it would be nice for American fans to  be able to buy the albums we actually grew up with on CD.

B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles, in Abbey Road, do extremely creative chord progression, the likes of which are rare.  The weave three or more themes throughout seven songs (tracks 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16) and yet make them sound completely  different.  They introduce songs in major keys with minor introductions  (track 8).  Simply changing a drum line completely changes the tone of a  refrain after it is heard once (track 6).  This music is much more  important than just &quot;it's a good rock song.&quot;  In an age of  mundane, monotonous music, it is always good to go back to an albumm with  innovation.  There is no &quot;filler&quot; in this work.  This is an  example of popular music actually having merit.  Leonard Bernstein's  program for children reccomended that children listen to the Beatles.   Musicians almost universally recognise the merit of this band.
0553213105|3.0|An Ok book for anyone who's into that sort of thing i suppose but come on, it isn't very believable in some places. Take for instance the supposed intelligence of one Elizabeth Bennet who is initially so incredibly blinded  by her own prejudice that she cannot see Mr. Darcy for who he really is. Am  i the only person who thinks that were Elizabeth so intelligent then she  must be able to look at things from both sides of the coin as the saying  goes. To be honest with you for it's time it is an excellent Romance novel  but it's just the niggling little things like that that kinda make you  think that had more thought gone into it it could have been so much  better...
1573226521|1.0|I found this book really boring.  The storyline is nothing much.  The main character irritates me because I feel that the author tries so hard to create him to be 'cool' which in real life would turn out to be a really  sad man if he really has that kind of personality.  The story drags on and  makes big deals about unimportant things.  I think many people like this  book because of the 'Paradise Island' which the author has described in the  book - no work, free food, free dope, swimming all day, party all night  etc. That's about it.

This is one of the creepy, scariest flicks I have ever seen gore or not. It was way ahead of  it's time for the effects but even that is not where the element of fear  comes from. I saw it when it first came out and it is still as scary today.  If you like real goosebump raising, prickly scalp, is someone watching me,  &quot;Hitchcockian&quot; fear don't pass this one up!

From the very moving and emotional &quot;Gravity of love&quot; to the pulsating rythems of &quot;Push the Limits&quot; &amp; &quot;Modern Crusader&quot;, Cretu leaves you breathless  and pushing replay! The whole cd is nicely tied together with a simular  theme you'll hear from time to time. It's truely a groundbreaking musical  experience. Those of you stuck on &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; Get over it! Yes  it was a nice work, but really, you seem so set and closed minded that you  can't enjoy &quot;fresh, new&quot; work. I know Cretu doesn't want to  rehash and stick to the same thing. He wants to venture out into new  teritory and explore what he can offer. That's being a true artist! I  should know, I am one. Enjoy!
0446525537|5.0|I was so saddened by this book in a wonderful way.  I think how simple life must have been when controlled by the heart - not computers, video games and so on.  I think this was such a well written story that I felt  the pain and yet also felt the dedication and committment that was in both  hearts as they grew and experienced so many things.  In a way it makes me  feel I really missed out on something by not being a part of the slower  paced people - before all of this modernism.  I loved this book and because  I read it will now try to slow down and totally enjoy, soak in and  appreciate much more of what goes on around me.

6305263299|5.0|Finally, Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of F.W. Murnau's silent classic is available on video and DVD in the U.S..  It is a beautiful film full of otherworldly imagery and poetic nuance.  Klaus Kinski is, at once, hideous  and pitiful as the vampire Count.  Isabella Adjani brings both a convincing  depth and strength to the role of Lucy, a performance that rivals that of  Kinski's.  Their clash of wills fuels this somber meditation on death,  decay, and despair and keeps the viewer riveted despite the languid pace.   This film functions like a nightmare which makes it that much scarier.   Those who like to have their horror spoon-fed to them would do well to  avoid this film at all costs.  For everyone else, Werner Herzog has crafted  an exceptional film that is as challenging as it is entertaining.
0792842723|3.0|Not a bad movie. The special effects and story are okay, and it is a good first effort at the bond role by Brosnan. One of the few flaws of the movies was the traditional BMW, which was hardly shown off by Bond (this  was heavily made up for it Tomorrow Never Dies). Another disappointment was  that there were only two Bond girls, and he only slept with one of them.  All in all not a bad movie, and it is worth watching.

0783225733|5.0|If you can buy only one DVD this year, &quot;Apollo 13&quot; should be your choice.<br />Despite the fact that a vast number of the audience knows the outcome of this movie before it even begins, the film is an excellent  example of suspense-building artistry and movie-making craft.  Director Ron  Howard, an amazing cast and an incredible crew (with superb digital work by  Digital Domain), have created a work of art that will glue you to your  chair, make you laugh, make you cry, and convince you that, yes, the  geeky-looking guy with a pocket protector and horn-rimmed glasses may  indeed be a &quot;steely-eyed missile man&quot; or better yet... a true  hero.<br />The special effects in this movie must be mentioned, yet it is  difficult to know how to express just how awesome they are. They are  perfection, to put it simply.  Not overdone or intrusive, but still  beautifully executed and seamlessly integrated into the story.  One other  note: I watched &quot;Apollo 13&quot; all the way through twice (on VHS)  without ever even wondering how they managed the weightlessness.  The  effects are *that* good and the story is *that* compelling.<br />If the  incredible story, flawless cinematography and special effects, beautiful  score and awesome cast aren't enough (and they are for me!), the extras on  the DVD version make this a must-have for every DVD owner.  With two  full-length audio commentary tracks (one by director Ron Howard, the other  by Marilyn and Jim Lovell), and an hour-long documentary detailing not only  the making of the movie, but interviews with the real Apollo 13 crew and  mission controllers, plus extra production notes (and the usual trailer),  there are easily 7 hours of entertainment on this one DVD.  <br />For those  who remember the agony of awaiting their return as well as those to whom  this story is brand new, there is something for everyone in this love  letter to the Apollo program and to the heroic men for whom the entire  world stopped some 30 years ago.
B00000064G|5.0|What a disgrace that such a passionate and powerful album would have one its songs bastardized by being used to sell a car.  Whoever is responsible for this should be ashamed of themselves.  STOP THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF  ART!  We are not free from the mind pollution of our commodity and  consumption obsessed culture.  Demand space free of advertisments before  there is none left.
B00000K19E|5.0|With hundreds and thousands of reviews here (which I haven't read), there's not much I can add. But here goes:<br />This movie is a great action adventure, with great action sequences, and some very imaginative images  (and mediocre acting, but hey, who cares). It might not make complete sense  (wouldn't it have been less troublesome for the machines to harness nuclear  power?), but then, what other movie does? It's just very cool.<br />The DVD  complements this beautiful movie with great production values. You get the  best scenes running at the beginning of the movie, and in the background  behind the menu. The transitions are very nice, without taking too much  time. The behind-the-scenes feature is pretty fascinating. The commentary  track is nice, and does give some more insight into the movie, but is not  that exciting. The music track is great. It's amazing to hear the music  without the actor voices or effects. It's just so cool, and I wish that  more movies would do this. There's also an exciting feature called  &quot;follow the white rabbit&quot;, where a rabbit supposedly appears on  the screen and you can then select it and see special things. I didn't see  it at work due to the software player I use (and I had a bit of trouble  with the other features, too).<br />You also get some PC stuff, including a  storyboard and some articles. The features didn't seem to fit that well  with my screen resolution of 1280x1024, and are not terribly exciting, but  the storyboard is nice.<br />All in all, this is a great movie and a very nice  DVD, a recommended addition to any home DVD library.
0767836286|2.0|If you are a Tim Robbins or Joan Cusack fan you'll enjoy their work, because they are very good.  If you are Jeff Bridges fan I think you'll be disappointed because he's awful.  The overwhelming impression he leaves is  that he spends the whole movie screaming his lines or crying....he doesn't  of course, but watching him go through this movie is torture.  It's  impossible to understand how the director couldn't see that the performance  was horrible.<br />The plot is highly contrived.  One can only assume that  Jeff Bridge's character must not have a clue about the subject matter that  he teaches because everything catches him by surprise.  That would be more  believeable if the main character wasn't supposed to have spent  considerable time studying this stuff.  But then given the plot all  semblance of logic and reason is thrown out the window about 10 minutes  into the movie.  The movie veers from creating a subversive, paranoid  vision of suburbia to a car chase laden, fight scene action movie.  And the  &quot;punch in the gut ending&quot; plays out in ridiculous fashion as it's  only patently obvious what's happening and yet no one takes any action.   Two stars for Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack and the first half of the movie.
6302000823|5.0|When this film debuted at Cannes, it received a standing ovation.  Once you've seen it, you'll know why.  It simply doesn't get any better than this.  Three cheers for Toto and Fredo!
0375707972|5.0|Der Roman &quot;der Vorleser &quot; von Bernhard Schlink ist einfach Super!  I absolutely loved Schlink's novel &quot;The Reader&quot;... I had picked up the German Edition of this novel in Germany this summer, and  finally got around to reading it.  I couldn't put it down and read it in  four hours.  I haven't read the English translation, so I cannot judge the  version that others have written reviews about on this site, but the German  novel is the best thing I have read since Patrick Suskind's &quot;The  Perfume&quot; a few years ago. It is extremely thought provoking and makes  one seriously think about love, relationships, guilt, responsibility,shame  etc.
B000002H33|5.0|If Black Sabbath were the Old Testament of the Heavy Metal Bible, then MetallicA were the New Testament.  The guitar work is similar to Sabbath, utilizing slow, down-tuned hooks &amp; riffs along with chunky power chord  structures, while also borrowing from such bands as Diamond Head, Venom,  &amp; other such European bands.  This is a must own.

B00003BDXG|1.0|Phew! This is one graphic and disturbing movie.  I'm just thankful that I only paid two bucks for the rental and didn't waste more money on it.  See it once, make sure it's your kind of movie before you even consider buying  it.  Natural Born Killers is definitely not in my taste.  Take this with a  grain of salt as I'm not a big Oliver Stone fan to begin with, and  Tarantino is pretty much hit or miss with me.
B00000IHHM|5.0|I was first introduced to the music by my daughter, Jessica Grov, who was cast as Fleur de Lys, and is alternating as Esmeralda in the Las Vegas production which opened on January 21, 2000. I am an opera and classical  music lover, and felt that this &quot;type&quot; of music certainly is not  for me. Then I went to see the opening performance in Las Vegas last week,  and went back FIVE more times. If I did not have to return home, I would  have stayed to watch several more performances. Since returning to  Columbus, Ohio, I have not stopped playing the exquisite live recording of  the French cast. From the haunting opening number extolling &quot;The Age  of the Cathedrals&quot;, to Esmeralda's lovely melodious lines, the  beautiful duets and ensemble pieces such as &quot;Belle&quot; (is there a  song ever written more beautiful than this?) to the lovely duet between  Esmeralda and Fleur de Lys, all the songs by the gifted composer, Richard  Cocciante are without exception outstanding, even, no, PARTICULARLY to an  opera snob like myself.  I was driving to work this morning and was  listening to the beautiful, heartbreaking final song, Quasimodo's soaring  plea as Esmeralda's spirit takes flight. I cried so hard, I lost my contact  lens.  If you love opera, if you love rock, if you love pop, if you love  music... buy this CD even if you, like me, do not understand French. Then  go to Las Vegas to see the English version so handsomely translated by Will  Jennings (&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; - The Titanic), and so admirably  performed by an outstanding US cast. And see if you don't go back for more,  and more. And then listen to the CD again!
0767821769|4.0|Stepmom is a true feel-good drama. It isn't a serious family tearjerker like Kramer vs. Kramer or Ordinary People, but an inspirational story for people who have been involved in divorces or family splitups. I must admit,  the film had hardly any realism, but I think that wasn't a factor in making  this film. The acting is the main part of the success. Roberts holds her  own against Sarandon (in a role seemingly written to win an Oscar) and  proves she is an actress with a capable range. Also there is much  inspiration glowing from the film. That is very good to see in a movie with  0 realism. So rent this movie if you wanna feel good and sad at the same  time.
031286504X|5.0|This novel, although short, is absolutely outstanding.<br />While this book is advertised as one of the best vampire novels of all time, it is really not about the vampires at all, but about a man.  This is the story of what  one man can endure, what his limits are, how much he can accept, and what  will happen when he goes too far.<br />Yes, there are vampires in the book,  and yes, he does hunt them by day, but it's not an action story; the  suspense is more pyschological. This is also one of the more different  vampire books you will ever read.<br />Somewhat short and written precisely,  words are not wasted here, and the beauty and simplicity of the language is  part of the appeal that this book holds.  Robert Neville is an amazingly  real character, and the ending of this book is perfect.  While I have not  yet read the multiple other stories by Matheson in this volume, I Am Legend  alone is worth the cover price.
630512762X|5.0|there's a 100% action movie and that's between a human in good and evil. I love john woo movie a lot and I seen his movie from hong kon to new york and that's no way you can find his personal stylier.And The Martix must  learn from his.      I will see im-2 3 times,so what do you think
B000023VTQ|5.0|Whether or not you're a Julia Roberts fan, you'll have to appreciate her ability, in this film to portray a superstar close to her real-life situation.  She is charming and funny in this movie, but has a mean streak  that probably is not too far off from reality.  Hugh Grant plays the  perfect low-self-esteemed Englishman who doesn't look for love with a  moviestar yet is unable to detatch himself from her once he's there.  The  supporting cast members, especially Grant's roommate Spike, keep you  laughing throughout and keep the quiet and even-keeled Grant interesting.   It's the kind of movie that depicts something we all, in some small way,  would like to have happen to us with our favorite actor.
B000002WYT|5.0|another superb album with another hit song.With Crash(into me)leading the way it no suprise that  this album would be a must for any serious fan. there are some great songs other than crash, such as tripping billies,to  much,#41,and so much to say.the only question now is when will there be a  greatest hits album.
0345350499|5.0|This book kept me glued to its pages.  It reads beautifully, it flows and you just want to inhale it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I was blown away by the quality of this album.  On this one the Chili Peppers toned down their funky side and the results are spectacular.  There are still some funky songs, mind you, but the mellow ones are best: Scar  Tissue, Otherside, Californication and Road Trippin are simply beautiful.   Each this member of this band has a unique talent for what they do, and  when they come together the results are amazing.  If you're like me, and  enjoyed past Chili Peppers songs like My Friends or Under the Bridge, but  felt less good about the funk, then do yourself a favor and buy this album  at once.
B0000062GE|5.0|I bought this title from Columbia House as Explicit, but they sent me edited.  It just didn't sound right bleeping out words that weave the songs togheter, so I bought the parental version.  Boy I love this CD.  It really  sounds like Filter's new stuff, and Chris Hall's wailing vocal on 'haunting  me' sounds like Richard Patrick's on Filter's 'I'm Not the Only One' It is  better thanfilter for two reasons:1. The CD is much longer, and 2. the  songs are faster and more emotional. Awesome and Weird in its own way.

B000002UAR|5.0|I can see why many critics say this album is better than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The sequence of the songs, the wonderful originality and creativity heard for the first time is quite a nice experience on  headphones and with a reefer. It's always fun to listen to and you can  never get tired of it once you can sing it in your sleep.

B000002UAU|5.0|If only you could rate albums on a scale of 1 to 10. This album would be an 11. I admit I only got it last year, yet I have listened to it well over 100 times, I can safely say. Start to finish, of course. I don't know what  it is, but the songs all sound fresh and new every time. I realise there  may be a time when I get tired of it, and if that day ever comes, I can say  that the hours I spent listening to this album were the best hours of my  life (except maybe the hours spent with my hand. Heh Heh). Long live Sgt.  Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
0783216084|5.0|Few movies have been able to capture the audience's attention with such a simple opening scene. The brilliant combination of surrealistic lighting, the twilight becoming dawn, and especially and PRIMARILY one extremely  haunting theme song ensure that Speilberg and co. have your undivided  attention. Jaws capitalised on something that our generation has sadly  become desensitised to: the feeling of fear. We've seen it all, whether it  be slashers gutting their screaming victims, hideous monsters on deserted  spaceships etc. But Jaws takes that which we can conceive as very real, the  Great White Shark and makes the audience feel that this could really happen  to you. The movie's buildup is fantastic and the climax is simply  unforgettable. The sheer malevolence with which Scheider delivers his coup  de grace in the face of an unblinking monster is definitely one of the  greatest cinematic sequences ever captured on celluloid. A must see for all  those who are WILLING to put themselves in the place of the three men on  the ship and realise along with them, that they are not necessarily the  most ruthless and remorseless beings out there in the wide open sea.
B000002UAX|5.0|This could very well be The Beatles' greatest achievement (aside Side 2 of Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper); a sprawling, visceral album. Sure it's chockful of fillers, but the fillers are all milked of their potential.  Isn't that what's really important?
B000002UB3|5.0|Could it be true? Just listen to Side 2 and tell me that those 20 or so minutes of music aren't one of the most gorgeous, fascinating and exhilirating you've ever heard. I dare you!
B000003TAR|5.0|It may sound atrocious at first listen, but by the third one, it'll be a classic and a cherised part of your collection. I didn't like it too much at first, but it grew on my like a rash. Brutal, uncompromising, and  absolutely beautiful. Long live Kurt Cobain!
0782008372|2.0|Well, I watched the DVD. Everyone was right (sigh). The video is so bad, it's literally unbelievable.  You spend more time looking at the grains and pixels than the movie, it's that distracting. Very awful transfer, the  story is good as it always was, but it is a waste of money.
0767808460|4.0|This is a really good movie, with a really good cast. Worth seeing only for the scene where Deborah Kerr finds out David Niven is cheating on her. Her reaction is priceless, and shows you what a wonderful actress she is.  Why four starts then? It is rather stagy at times. Other than that, it's a  good movie to pass an afternoon with.
B00003CXA6|5.0|An absolutely magnificent, historically accurate description of the the pivotal battle of the 19th (and, ultimately, the 20th) century. Yeah, I know, some would say it's purely nationalistic hubris to describe an 1863  battle in North America as THE pivotal battle of two centuries, but that's  how the &quot;mop flops.&quot; On Gettysburg's outcome depended the future  of the United (or dis-United) States.  Its outcome decided whether one  nation (the US), or two (the US and the CSA), would determine the course of  the next century.  Had the North lost, Great Britain and France (and,  perhaps, Germany) would have won. I'm no Ted Turner fan, but my hat's off  to him (in this instance).  Much pressure was put upon him to shorten the  movie, and he nobly resisted.  Result: a masterpiece which ranks with The  Ten Commandments, or The Greatest Story Ever Told. In this  &quot;enlightened&quot; (aka cynical) era, when it's difficult to imagine  laying down one's life for an idea, this faithful depiction of the  realities of combat (which only those who've heard a shot &quot;fired in  anger&quot; can truly appreciate) is much needed.<br />One piece of  advice...demand the director's cut in a DVD release. There's a lot of  excellent supplementary information in it that's missing from the truncated  early edition.  Settle only for the best.  Also...read &quot;The Killer  Angels&quot;.
B00002MZ12|5.0|I never really liked Alanis. All my friends would go crazy about her, sing her songs over and over untill i was ready to smack them. One night, not too long ago, I was flipping through channels and I got to mtv. Suddenly i  heard this voice, so honest and so pure, and i stopped to listen. I knew it  was Alanis, but i listened anyway. Somethin about this song was so true to  me, that in the middle I just started crying. It's so beautifull the way  she stands emotionally naked in front of an audience and simply says,  &quot;Here I am.&quot; I bought the cd and have been listening to it  non-stop. It's just so gentle and kind, it feels like home to me. Buy it,  it's amazing.
B000009VOL|4.0|I first heard of this album from a friend. He said he liked the way she sounded, so I took his judgement call and went with it.  She's good and creepy sounding. Reminds me of 2 o'clock in the morning in front of an open window, and some of the songs I make.  While it's missing something I cant  put my finger on, song #4 melts me..I can imagine that her next album will  truly startle me.
6303534422|5.0|I watched &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; tonight when I was babysitting.  The kids loved it and I enjoyed it too.  This movie contains enough of the little things to be appealing to children of all ages...including  teens...like me.  I don't think I've seen a better Disney movie.  This one  has to be my faveorite.  The music was good for people of all ages and I  have been searching the internet for the soundtrack.  It's not every day  that you see a teenager rave about PG movie.  Excellent Job Disney!
0783222955|5.0|I am a professor emeritus at a university in eastern Australia. I have taught this book in my class for over 15 years. Each time I see the movie, I am reminded of how this book echoed through the minds of readers and  publishers when it was published in 1960. Then, something magical happened.  A movie. This movie steals the very heart and soul of every human being  that watches it. I can still see the moist eyes and cheeks of my students  as they exit my classes. This movie is a timeless classic that will never  die. Please, make yourself feel good, and purchase this movie- or even rent  it for a night. You will never forget it. Gregory Peck crowns himself king  of the era.
B000000H3W|5.0|This band was the first in their genre to make a major-label album, titled &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; (another great album). Although this album (&quot;Arise&quot;) is a little dated, it's really way ahead of its time.  Sepultura are pretty well-known now, but when I first heard this album they  were almost unknown, and even at that time they pretty much buried  everything else out there. No wonder the folks at Epic Records took a  chance on them... This album is their best, in my humble opinion. It works  because there's a thread of similarity between the songs that's really  noticable even on first listen. Beautifully produced, this album also  happens to contain the first hints of the trademark tribal stuff which  became so prevalent on later efforts, which were not always successful  experiments. It's kind of sad that they later became so impressed with  Korn's production... they really had a sound of their own before  &quot;Roots&quot;.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Don't be upset that Santana changed his style: it's actually not that drastic of a change in my opinion. If Jimmi Hendrix were still around, he would indubitably have changed his style a bit to accomodate the younger  crowds. Carlos plays the guitar excellently, and he still makes you feel  something. Most artists could not still do that kind of work from the 60's  to the year 2000.

B0000019PA|5.0|Reviewer: ... it's a shame that some people actually gave this art a poor review. We may have all read The Diary of Anne Frank when we were in the 6th grade, but that's simply because it was  written by a child, making it an easy read. It is a truly powerful book  which explores the mind of a oddly mature and gifted teenager put into a  trying situation. You simply have to be an idiot to call it childish, or  'infantile'. This is a timeless and ageless book, one that anyone with a  heart and a brain can feel. Her entries are engaging. Reading them makes  you feel as trapped and terrified as she who wrote it. Jeff Magnum felt it,  and his yearnings are expressed in a good number of the songs on this  album. (not all of the songs deal with WWII)... Maybe &quot;A Music  Fan&quot; from GA should truly listen to or read the lyrics in these songs.  I went through the lyrics and gave it an intent listen, and I found one  question posed throughout the length of the album; &quot;...And will she  remember me 50 years later...&quot; that is it. The lyrics, including the  one quoted, help explore her emotions, and more importantly, the  songwriter's. I got news for you - this music isn't for me, you or any of  us - we listen but it isn't written to give us a better understanding, or  more insight into Anne Frank's diary. we can read the book and see for  ourselves. this is more a reflection of Jeff's emotions blurted out and  caught on tape. the overactive mind has to vent, i know how he feels. so  don't look for her feelings, look for his... Jeff Magnum has truly touched  upon an original and provocative sound, and has proven himself to be an  astounding songwriter. &quot;A Music Fan&quot; goes on to comment on the  music as poorly performed and poorly recorded... the quality of the  recording itself is not top quality. this is not the mainstream. unless you  are independantly wealthy, or have been around for a long time, it's not  possible for a songwriter to keep his integrity and make a top quality  recording. and even with second grade equipment, I only found one part on  the entire recoding that was flawed- Magnums voice seems to breach the  volume limit during &quot;Two-Headed Boy Pt.1&quot;. as for 'poorly  performed', I have not seen any evidence of this...maybe &quot;A Music  Fan&quot; thinks he can play a three-part harmony *perfectly in tune* on a  &quot;singing saw&quot;, as as done on &quot;Aeroplane...&quot;. If you  think Jeff Magnum can't sing, then I don't know what to tell you, maybe  you're deaf, or maybe you don't realize the lengths to which he pushes his  voice - successfully. What the few, and yet irritating detractors can't  see, is that they bought a cd that they are not ready for. They can't get  past what's shockingly new, what's inherrently emotive and what's truly  provacative about this album.
B000002A73|5.0|The &quot;older&quot; fans of Pink Floyd will recognise this as another masterpiece.<br />Roger, once again, taps far deeper into the thoughts of the listener's mind than many previous albums.  ATD is not only another  statement against the 'futility of war' etc., but also questions ones'  values and morals more seriously that any of the works of his or 'Floyds.   <br />The lyrics are rather lengthy, but compliment the everchanging shift of  music tense between the sad+passive to the angry+loud.  The music itself is  nothing short of excellent, &quot;technically perfect&quot; if you will.   Absolutely lovely guitar and harmonies.<br />Roger Waters' Amused To Death is  probably best listened to with lights down low.  It is only then you may  possibly be awakened by your sleeping thoughts he echoes in his lyrics.

B000002U8A|4.0|The members of Duran Duran were likely feeling their oates by 1983. Chorus heavy with Simon LeBon's voice double-tracked during the most urgent moments, these perky tracks are the summit of prolific creativity within a three-year period by Duran Duran. \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" could be viewed as the third record in a trilogy of Duran Duran's first three nine-song albums. Although \\"Ragged\\" might not match \\"Rio's\\" classic tunes, it boasts some premium pop songs with real earnestness in the vocals and lyrics. Even the non-hits on this album come off as completely radio-ready. As for the songs that did make it to the masses via radio, \\"The Reflex,\\" \\"New Moon on Monday\\" and \\"Union of the Snake\\" are all well-known and were some of the last string of mega-hits by Duran Duran during this great era for the band.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise about Duran Duran is how their lively songs often contain morose lyrics despite the band's outwardly gregarious  image; within the songs are weighty personal issues. Take, for instance, \\"Shadows on Your Side,\\" where LeBon sings, \\"Scandal in white on a tangled vine/With everybody to say you're having the/Time of your life, when your life is on the slide.\\" LeBon shows his vocal range, too, on such great tunes as \\"New Moon on Monday\\" and \\"Of Crime and Passion,\\" from a classy-sounding baritone to high-pitched but nicely controlled levels.<br /><br />The last two tracks on this record break up the lively vibe of the previous seven ones. \\"Tiger Tiger\\" is a leisurely, exotic-sounding instrumental, while \\"The Seventh Stranger,\\" with its morose, longing lyrics and beautiful sound, comes of as a genuine tearjerker. Overall, there's just lots of tangents and bridges within these songs that make them very memorable, even after the first listen.<br /><br />If \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" has any faults, it might be that the songs come off as too tightly formulated and aiming to please. Still, this was a great release by Duran Duran before the classic five-member lineup disintegrated and everyone went their own way.an Duran before the classic five-member lineup disintegrated and everyone went their own way.
B0000041LL|5.0|This recording of the string quartets is easily the greatest complete recording.  The tone production, unity and profound interpretations yield a quartet which is second to none in Beethoven performance.  If you had this  recording, Brendel's complete piano sonatas and Kleiber's 5th and 7th  Symphonies you could throw out all your other recordings.
0060920386|5.0|A wonderful display of liquidity and executive brass
B0000041Q3|5.0|Quite simply this is an outstanding recording of Turandot despite Sutherland.  While she is up to the task, she does not shine like the rest of the production.  Pavarotti is at his best in this role - it is his and  no-one else's.  Caballe is totally perfect as Liu.  Mehta controlls the  orchestra brilliantly - huge brass where necessary, but supreme containment  enables the singers to be heard with utmost clarity even in the quieter  moments.  Ignore those who cite Sutherland's &quot;inability to sing the  role&quot;: this performance - as a whole - cannot be topped.
B00000JBCP|5.0|Hola mi nombre es Juan y como puedes ver soy uno mas de los fanaticos del fabuloso grupo MANA. Para mi su ultimo disco Mtv Unplugged es uno de los mejores discos que e escuchado en estos ultimos dias y como pueden checar  las canciones nuevas no nuevas pero cantadas en ese genero si lo son, yo  pienso que esas canciones son bien compuestas al genero de rock/pop y  especialmente MANA el number one in USA in rock, es como un relampago  fuerte el nuevo disco porque hiso gritar a todos y cantar sus canciones. Yo  me despido en caso  de que alguien lea mi opinion acerca de MANA escribeme  un e-mail a juanruelas@juno.com
0790734850|3.0|I was told by my friends this movie is even better than Chinatown, but I was disappointed. Not that the movie is bad, but it's just beyond compare to Chinatown. LA Confidential is just like one episode from 'the untoucheables', while Chinatown carries much deeper meanings to Power,  Corruption &amp; Evil, not your usual gangster/cops movie. If you have not  seen Chinatown, rent or buy one. You won't regret it.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album is equally spectacular to her first album, but she is more grown up now.  Anyone who has ever been scorned by a man or anyone, will love Alanis, especially Supposed Former Infactuation Junkie.
B000000I0Q|5.0|The best Hackett cd and one of the best 20 progressive albums ever made
068484267X|5.0|I must say, that Ive never read through a book in two weeks. Esp. not if it was in English (as I am german). But this book makes reading a mania. You want to know how the story is continuing. What will happen with Franks  father? Will he give up drinking? What about Franks family? Who will  survive? How do they develop? Sometimes I had to laugh so much over the  story but afterwards I had to be ashamed of myself that I laughed because  you dont know if you cry on the misery or you laugh about the thougts of a  little boy. Though sometimes the language has an accent it is easy to read.  Great, fascinating, wonderful, 1a!  Cant wait to read `Tis.
6305627347|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant and subversive comedies in years, with a level of wit and chutzpah that is rarely seen in the homogenized, boring world of American theatres.  The obscenity is unrelenting, and it makes  one's jaw hit the floor, but nothing in today's cinema can rival the  farting tapdance of Terrence and Phillip.  Also a wonderful modern day  version of the musicals of the silver screen, and a scathingly funny  indictment of the hypocrisy of Hollywood.  Don't miss it.
B000002IST|2.0|Okay I KNOW I'm gonna get a lot of &quot;not helpful&quot; votes on this one, but let me just say that &quot;I Can't Dance&quot; is the only song ever made that can make me actually physically ill while I'm listening to  it. It's THAT bad! How this album sold a million copies the same year as  the Replacements broke up due to &quot;lack of popularity&quot; is one of  the gravest injustices in rock n roll.
6305657939|3.0|OK, it's not art - although it does involve the theft of art (and it's important not to get the two things confused) but it is fun and a pure vehicle for Yuppie escapism - Thomas Crown on a $100K cat boat, Thomas  Crown in a glider, on the golf course, on a beautiful island, having sex  with wild abandon ... and on some days, when you're not reading Socrates  &amp; Plato, that's not only enough, it's just what you need.  I pride  myself on not being an intellectual lightweight (most days) but I liked it  and I'll buy the video when the price drops out of the stratosphere.
B00000IGGA|3.0|I love Tom Waits, but it's frustrating that he's become something of a sacred cow among rock critics, much like Neal Young of late.  This is not a great album by any stretch.  Those that say this is a retread are right.   All of these musical ideas have already been explored, if not mastered  utterly, on earlier albums, most notably Bone Machine, Rain Dogs and Small  Change.  For the most part, these songs are inferior to similar songs on  other albums.  I like &quot;Big in Japan.&quot;  I like &quot;Black Market  Baby.&quot;  But &quot;Lowside of the Road&quot; is &quot;Gun Street  Girl.&quot;  &quot;Get Behind the Mule&quot; is &quot;Murder in the Red  Barn.&quot; &quot;What's He Building in There&quot; is &quot;The Ocean  Doesn't Want Me.&quot;  &quot;Hold On&quot; is &quot;Who Are You.&quot;   &quot;Chocolate Jesus&quot; is &quot;Jesus Gonna Be Here.&quot;  &quot;The  House Where Nobody Lives&quot; is plain awful.  Are the songs good?   Mostly, but the album is too long.  New ground is broken, but barely.  It  simply does not deserve the acclaim it's been receiving from the music  press.
630575067X|5.0|I've watch all the Star Wars movies, and not one has grabbed me and taken me for such a thrill ride as Phantom Menace! This movie is filled with action and many twists and turns, and after the 2 hours you'll be begging  for more!  Liam Nieson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman do a wonderful  job as Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Queen Amidala. This is a definate must have  for any Star Wars fan, as this is the best Star Wars feature to date! Also  recommended would be the Phantom Menace video game for either PC or PSX,  also available on Amazon.com!
B000002UA5|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums for many years.  I finally had to get the disc.  I had forgotten how incredible Pink Floyd sounds on headphones until I listened to this album again.  I can see how many people  might not properly appreciate the studio disc but I have to say that I  bought this album the first time, and this time too, for &quot;Several  Species of small furry animals...&quot;  It has to be experienced.  Music,  for me, takes my mind off the present and takes me on a tour of the mind or  soul of the artist(s) and this disc excels at that task.  I could never  limit myself to one Pink Floyd album but if I could only have two, it would  be this and &quot;Animals&quot;
0812589041|5.0|This is quite easily the best book I've ever read.  The combination of an interesting look into an advanced civilization with the deeply philosophical undertones that Card adds is simply amazing.  Having a degree  in philosophy I often find that many books that have a philosophical  element are shallow and not worth my attention but I love this book more  than any other book I've ever read and every time I finish it I want to  start climbing mountatins.  It encourages you to go out there and face the  world.  A truly momentous and empowering work of art.
1559408898|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen.  Although violent, there is an underlying thread that runs throughout the movie. This movie satires big business, and the excess of the mid-80's. The special effects, and the  robots(ED 209 and the RoboCop suit) still are visually appealing in 2000.    What makes this addition so great is the running comentary of the writers  and director.  I have watched this movie many times, but the extras that  come with this version made this viewing as enjoyable as the first time!
0792839846|5.0|I don't care what AFI says this movie wins for me because it not only has all the artistic merit of most of the other movies in the running but it also appeals to a much wider audience than Citizen Kane and the like could  ever hope to.  If you've never seen this movie before you'll be amazed how  many of the movies you've seen are derived from Casablanca.  If you have  seen it this is a great edition and the interviews and discussions that  have been added are very interesting.

0385493800|1.0|Contrasting to the books written before by John Grisham (I read them all), this book is of such a poor quality, i.e. lack of plot, lack of suspension, lack of thrill and lack of vivid characters.  I definitely think the media  has built up too much expectations for readers prior to the publication of  the book.  It does not derserve.  Sadly, it seems to me that the book was  written in a such rush, with no literacy values.  it is a pure commercial  book, meant to make a quick buck, rather than to entertain readers.  I was  very disappointed and will have a second thought on whether or not to  buy/read his next book.
B000002BUY|5.0|This CD is awesome.  If you definetly love Limb Bizkit, Slipknot, Korn, or any other heavy band(Deftones), buy this CD.  It stays good all the way through, and the one song that doesn't have any lyrics is really messed up,  but still sounds cool.  Buy this CD!
0790731894|5.0|We see a lot of movies. I was beginning to lose faith in my movie picking abilities because rarely do I see anything that truly engrosses me. Until this movie. This movie, on DVD is great. The visual is fantastic and the  sound, oh my God, the sound. The ending, unlike other movies, doesnt  undermine the rest of the film but truly provides an amazing climax. I  rented it tonight but will buy it tomorrow.  I loved it and applauded at  the ending.
B00000IPAX|5.0|i love this cd it is 1 of the best i have ever listened to. It is surely a must have to our cd selection.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Absoutley brilliant album by the band that never sold out. Strummer and the boys deliver the album of their lives which in my opinion easily beats Never Mind The ........ by The Sex Pistols. The music is superbly  innovative and the lyrics are incredible. London Calling is simply an album  you must own.
B000031XCR|2.0|I love Celine Dion but All the Way was a dissapointment. I expected more from her. I love Because You Loved Me and Thats The Way It Is but thats about it. Celine should use her voice in more pop songs. The opera is  wearing off a bit. Too bad Celine! I'll wait for you to release your next  album and then we'll see!
B000002UAX|4.0|The White Album is a very good record by a very good (if sometimes overated) band. Songs like Back In The U.S.S.R, Helter Skelter &amp; Rocky Racoon are really good. But songs like I`m So Tired &amp; Birthday are a  bit lackluster. But then there is Revolution 9 which is incredibly  influential and superbly put together. Overall a good album but not as good  as its reputation.
B0000203Y5|5.0|If you buy this video and put it on while getting ready to go out. Fastfoward to &quot;Quarto de Tula&quot; and you will be the life of the party. I guarantee it.
B000002AS3|5.0|This stunning album is up there with The Manics,  The Stone Roses, Belle &amp; Sebastian and Super Furry Animals as one of the 90`s greatest debuts. The albums 2 standout tracks are the thunderously brilliant Cigarettes  &amp; Alcohol and the beautiful Live Forever. In England Definitly Maybe  and Whats The Story (Morning Glory) were the albums which defind a  generation. If you were a teenager in the 90`s you will never forget this  album.
B000009ED0|1.0|Wow, after lsitening to this album is: how on earth did a guy like this (ie unoriginal hick-hopper) manage to sell so many albums?  Luck can be a pretty crazy thing sometimes.
6300214826|5.0|This film is just the greatest film I have ever seen in my life. The further down the river they go the more followers Kurtz has, which can be said of so many great minds that go over the edge(Nick Drake, Richey  Edwards, J.D. Salinger, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Stanley Kubrick). The  acting from Sheen and Brando will probably never be bettered.
B00003CWPR|3.0|Did I watch a different movie than everybody else? Yes, Tom Cruise was great in it and I'd say so was Nicole Kidman. But the story doesn't hold a candle to some of his other masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove or 2001). Some  person said there were a lot of climactic scenes, but that person probably  read Ebert's review that each scene had an arc of its own. Seen at its  whole, it's an interesting movie about how easy it is to get into adultery  or sexual perversion, while celebrating marriage! Weird. Good movie, but  would I watch it again? No. Now, if you want to watch a movie for its  brilliance over and over again, watch Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.
B00000JFSL|5.0|This album is amazing, pure and simple.  From unbelievably tight rhythm playing, to fluid solos and wickedly fast runs.  Check out Circles - it starts off with a moody atmospheric chorused and delayed beginning, going  into double-time wah-inflected runs, and Van Halen type tapping, then, just  as calmly, back to the rhythm guitar again.  For sensitive phrasing, and  oh-so-perfect notes, listen to Always...All I can say is wow.  The gold CD  actually improves the recording quality noticably - I own both the original  and gold, and have noticed it.  BUY THIS CD!
044100590X|1.0|I read the thing back in 1972 and thought it overblown.  But I was just a kid.  Will the ensuing 28 years improve it?  If not I'll read a Robert Heinlein novel to get back on track.
068484267X|5.0|I loved this book. It was really sad and funny at the same time. It really shows the poverty and strife of the people in Ireland, and I recommend it to anyone. I can't wait for the next to come out in paperback.
0380804557|1.0|I read Neverwhere and loved it.  It's on my list of favorite books and looked forward to Stardust. What a disappointment.  It's all fluff and no body.  The characters were boring and I didn't really care what happened to  them. I read halfway through the book and put it away. I enjoy fantasy but  this was sad.  It's as if he tried to write A Princess Bride but fell far  short.  Write a continuation of Neverwhere and please don't try to do a  fairytale again.
B000002KIE|5.0|Quite simply, this is best punk album I can think of.  Anyone who even vaguely listens to punk *must* own this album in one form or another.  If you don't, just buy it.  &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; is a bitter look at  the 70s UK.  &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot; defined punk as we know it.  The  other songa are just awesome as well.
630305904X|2.0|ORLANDO is not the best movie I have seen, but it does have a small spice to it. Spectacular backgrounds, and sets lighten this semi-period piece up. This movie has some dull moments, and also goofy moments with Tilda Swinton  looking at the camera, talking to the audience. The transformation from a  man to a woman is un-discussed, making it alittle hard for the viewer to  know why he or she did it. This movie was different, I will tell you that.  Billy Zane's character (even though getting second most attention in  advertising, and in the credits) is only on the screen for about ten  minutes, has probably about 8 lines. I do not recomend this movie to be  purchased, though if your a fan of such film noir -- DIG IN.
B00000JCB2|4.0|MY FAV IS BREAK STUFF. GIMME SOMETHING TO BREAK.  THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT FOR STARS IS BECAUSE OF N TO GETHER NOW. I HATE RAP!
B0000060LT|5.0|A wonderful album. I'd never heard the Dirty Three before, now I'm wondering where I've been all these years. If you've ever been in the middle of nowhere in a crowd of people, in the middle of the night, in the  wilderness of your mind, or alone in a sea of conformity, this album's for  you. Ocean Songs is ultimate alienation, despair, hope-- all drifting, of a  piece. The sound of the group is impressive in itself, the textures, tones,  spacing, hollow yet full-bodied, symphonic yet intimate, close and far  away, all mixed to perpetual, aural aching. The album is blue and bright,  and might change your life.
B00000K19E|5.0|Since I was lucky enough to watch the DVD with surround sound (my first ever DVD!) I had the full effects and advantages of all the fancy technology...totally unique and amazing!  I really enjoyed the added  features of the DVD, including actor profiles and how the effects were  done.  A visual feast for anyone, especially those who enjoy sci-fi or  futuristic drama.  Although like most these days, this movie has enough  people getting blown away by big automatic weapons to last for me for a  millennium, the other details were just so amazing that I was able to look  beyond that for once.  I liked the fact that Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss),  was a strong woman but still had a very compassionate and vulnerable side.   Of course, Keanu Reeves is very easy to look at and was good in the  character of Neo.  This is one of the few movies I want to watch several  times over. And the ending leaves you desperately wanting more...hurry up  with those sequels Larry and Andy!
0517122707|1.0|I'm surprised anyone would publish such moronic work It's a stupid inane story about an obnoxious, arrogant 30 year old fat slob who lives with  his ignorant dimwit mother. OK, but they didn't do anything! I mean, what was  the  point. It's suppose to be funny (so say the majority below) but is  only disgustingly  retarded &amp; brainless, witless drivel.   What a waste  of trees and every thing else.
B0000027I6|5.0|ROGER WATERS IS A ARTISTIC GENIUS. THIS IS HIS BEST SOLO ALBUM, I OWN ALL THREE AND IS ON PAR WITH THE OLD FLOYD ALBUMS, I ALSO HAVE ALL OF THOSE. AND IT IS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN THE NEW FLOYD CDS. WHAT GOD WANTS, AND THE  BRAVERY OF BEING OUT OF RANGE ARE THE BEST SONGS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.  ALL FLOYD FANS AND ROGER FANS SHOULD BUY THIS CD. IT IS ONLY BEAT OUT OF  BEING THE GREATEST CD EVER BY THE WALL. FORGETT SYD BARRETT ROGER WATERS IS  THE REAL CRAZY DIMOND. SHINE ON ROGER!
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is the best Blink 182 has ever made.  I mean no matter how many times I hear it, it seems like it never gets old.  Plus I love every track on the CD.  This CD is also Enhanced.  I say buy it!   The money you have  to pay is well spent!  :)
6300246876|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! was historically accurate in every aspect but the death toll.  The attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;A day that will live in infamy&quot; (FDR), cost America 2,400 men.  The movie depicted the  American government ignoring the many warning signs that were seen.  It  also depicted the true surprise of the Japanese attack on the American  Pacific forces in Pearl Harbor.  This is a must for anyone who loves  history.
B00002MZ12|5.0|When I first heard Alanis, it was sort of a revelation. Even though I am a man, turning the things around, I may identify. Jagged Little Pill was great, and she plays here in UNPLUGGED the best songs of this records, and  also the best songs of SUPOSSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. Yes, maybe is  too soon, but when you hear it you prove that theres nothing wrong with an  advanced attempt. Combining the great lyrics with the best musical  arrangements, Alanis and David Campbell created an album that sticks in  your mind. The best songs are definetly These R the Thoughts and Uninvited.  But Head Over Feet surely overpass the studio version. Adding a great  cover- Polices King of Pain - She makes a version even better than the  Polices song. Yes! Believe me! . And How can you forget The great string  arrangement of You Oughta Know. Is simply better than any song Ive ever  heard with orchrestations. So, If you want a great collection of her songs  (only the best) you can buy this record.
6304698798|5.0|The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly, never looked or sounded better than it does now! The trio of Clint Eastwood (the good), the late Lee Van Cleef (the bad), and Eli Wallach (the ugly) are so believable its scary. The best  of the spaghetti westerns, it is given new life and new sound on DVD. The  picture is brighter and the music more pronounced, check out Tuco's  (Wallach) famous scene running thru the cemetary at the end while  &quot;Ectasy of Gold&quot; is playing, the music is actually bone chilling.  The movie is long (3 hours), however it would have been awesome if the 7  ommitted scenes were inserted in their proper place and not just where you  view them seperately. A couple are not very important (extra footage of  Tuco goofing with Blondie in the desert, extra dialogue at the bridge  scene), but a couple are neat and important (Angel Eyes visits a  Confederate camp looking for info, extra dialogue which is funny between  Tuco and Blondie on the stage coach before they are captured, etc.) The  bonus scenes make this a must-buy DVD for those who have the VHS version.  Not perfect, it should be complete with all the scenes a couple of other  reviewers mention inserted in their proper place. But, still an outstanding  movie with Eli Wallach (Tuco) and his comedy adding an element missing in  the first 2 spaghetti westerns!
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissettes big comercial triumph with this record is the last thing you should care about. You have to focus on the lirycs and the music, forgetting all that junk of selling. Starting with &quot;All I really  Want&quot;, a raw, honest song, this album promises to be a big one.  Following this song, is the popular &quot;You oughta know&quot;, even  though this is the song that made her famous, is not the best from the  record. The best one is without a doubt HAND IN MY POCKET with a great  style, a flexible music and a great poem that is its lirics, this song  really is the best. So, you will notice when you hear this record that Im  right. And is the second best album, because only SUPOSSED FORMER  INFATUATION JUNKIE, her third album is better.
B00000J7S8|4.0|I heard Diana Krall for the first time not to long ago on The Conan O'brien show singing East of the Sun I knew immediately that I had to buy that album.  After looking all over I was unable to find it and was about  to give up when I figured I might as well look under Jazz and there it was.   I enjoy all kinds of music but traditionally I am biased against anything  labeled as Jazz (thanks to kenny-g).  Diana has a beautiful voice and her  music is a big change of pace for me, thanks to her I will look at the  genre in a different light now.

B00003CXCK|5.0|The story line is well known. (WWII-Nazi Germany-the &quot;Final Solution&quot;) What is not so talked about is how tastefully this movie is done. How it tugs at the heart strings, how, even though the subject matter  of the movie is also well known, (the Holocaust) the ending is brought to  you in such a way as to cause you to cry for joy as you witness Osker  Schlinder's transformation. It is not an overly religious movie in that any  one of any faith can enjoy it. This movie is a wonder for all time.
0451160916|1.0|I used to read King to be popular as every9one else was... this, Cujo, and the Stand ruined him. I am quite anti-King because of it. There are quite a few better authors (including my two favorites, Clive Barker and Brian  Lumley) and this book can not measure up to any of their work. normally I  haeva  feeling of satisfaction when i finish a book. I was bored when i  finished this one.
B000031XCR|4.0|Ok I have to admit, there's a whole lot more to Celine than Titanic. And was I ever surprised.<br />You gotta hand it to her. the woman never used her skin to sell albums, but only pure, raw determination with her voice.  That's commendable. She's the last of the &quot;real singers&quot; in our  generation. She really has the discipline of the old school, and the smarts  of the new school of pop artists. <br />That's what you think of when you  think of Celine Dion. The voice. <br />I really heard her songs for the first  time and I have a new respect for her. I didn't know her songs were so  incredible. The huge thunderous voice in a size 1 dress. Isn't that a  paradox? :)But she knows when to go understated too, like in &quot;I'm Your  Angel&quot;. That song is pure genious. I liked the Shanis Twain hook-up in  &quot;If Walls Could Talk&quot; and &quot;Live&quot;, the english version  of the musical, Notre Dame. <br />I loved all her 7 new songs, especially  That's the Way it Is. It's almost like two albums in one.- greatest hits  plus a whole other 7 new songs.That was generous of her.
B000009ED0|5.0|When I frist saw Kid Rock, I said &quot;he's a loser&quot; but when i heard Devi Without A Cause i said &quot;he's a winner&quot; He has such a tight band and most times the lyrics are pretty cool. My favorite song is  Devil W Out A Cause. Great Effort and CD. Yeah Baby!   WOW!
B00000JY1X|5.0|After about 3 months of owning this set I can say I am still impressed and bewildered by the scope and depth of the work. It just keeps finding it's way back into my CD players. In the car, at the office, the  portable...these 3 discs are mainstays in my listening. There is something  for everyone and some really brilliant songs lurk among the 69. Merritt has  a gift and you should hear what he does with it!
0393317552|4.0|The reader from Boston who advises us not to 'read too much into' this book has it right.  I think those who are convinced that genes and racial factors have resulted in modern disparities in wealth and 'advancement' of  the civilizations of earth will find a demon lurking between the lines of  the book.  Those who can read with a more open mind will find the book an  accessible, thought-provoking work that displays a broad (though not always  deep) understanding of many factors which have played roles in humankind's  development.<br />It's interesting to read the reviews submitted by the former  kind of reader, most of whom seem convinced that white northern peoples and  societies are the product of superior genes.  It's surprising that many of  them, on the vanguard of the evolution of human intellect, make egregious  spelling and grammatical errors in their reviews!
6301955293|5.0|Viewing &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; is like making a quantum leap to a small southern town in the early 1950s.  I don't believe I have seen another movie which evokes such a distinct sense of time and place.   Although I was not alive in the 1950s, I have heard relatives discuss what  it was like to live in a small southern town in the 1950s, and I am  impressed by how much of what I've been told is reflected in this film. For  example, the makers of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; clearly conveyed  the importance of the local movie theater as a place for entertainment at a  time when many people did not yet own a television.  Also, the music played  on radios and record players throughout the movie seems very authentic  (with the poorer people listening to Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell, and  the wealthier people listening to Tony Bennett and Frankie Laine).     <br />I  don't want to give the impression that &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; is  a two-hour version of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show.&quot;  These characters  seem like real people rather than the romanticized versions of 1950s  small-town people we see on TV sitcoms (not that I have anything against  Andy and Barney).  The characters in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; have  visible weaknesses as well as strengths.  Furthermore, loneliness,  aimlessness, and selfishness are the most pervasive topics dealt with in  this movie, so don't rent it expecting the feel-good movie of 1971.<br />And  yet, in spite of the sobering themes, I have to admit that &quot;The Last  Picture Show&quot; does put me in a good mood.  It is always a joy to  witness convincing dialog, acting, and setting combined in a memorable and  thought-provoking story!  I strongly recommend &quot;The Last Picture  Show.&quot;

0805062971|5.0|This book was quite possibly the best I've ever read. I am a sophmore in high school and haven't read anything that made me want to finish a book in over 2 years. I got fight club at nine A.M and finished it within i hours.  The book was like the  movie but more graphic and with the writters use of  imagery. I couldn't put it down. If you haven't  seen the movie go out and  buy the book and see the movie. This morning I ordered the other books by  Chuck Palahniuk and ordered the movie as soon is it comes out in april.
B00000FZ1V|4.0|Ghostbusters is a really good fun film.  Reitman brought the best out of the Aykroyd and Murray combination, the latter barely utttering a serious line in the entire film.  Ramis is also good as the straight man of the  three, while Weaver gets a totally serious role as their first customer.   This all-star cast also includes great performances from both Rick Moranis  and Annie Potts.  By the way look out for the scene when Moranis throws a  party, he improvised a speech that lasts several minutes which is  hilarious!   <br />The concepts of this film are silly in the extreme, but  somehow during the film they seem almost believable.  This is a film that  you can show the whole family and please all.  Overall this is an Eighties  classic with Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd at their very best, a must see for  all comedy fans.<br />Translation to DVD is superb with both picture and sound  quality at its best.  I saw the region 2 edition which has (I think) a  different commentary which was both interesting and fun to listen to, so I  expect the commentary on the US release is even better (it normally  is).<br />Watch this film!
0553062182|5.0|There are not many books I bother to read over, but I come back to this book at least once a month for advice, encouragement and to better understand myself. As a teenager, I feel that the author did not explain  and elaborate enough about these extremely difficult and significant years.  Also, a subject on which the author claims she could write a book-she does  not even write half a page! But all in all,this book is wonderful to give  highly sensitive people a whole new vantage point on themselves. ---If you  are a highly sensitive teenage girl (15-17 years old)please write me-I  would love to compare experiences and share advice!
0783229100|4.0|Superb performances by three great actors (Robert Shaw, Robert Redford and Paul Newman). A great plot. An excellent musical score.<br />This film grips you from start to finish as one of the all time greats.  The plot centres  around a young con-artist who wants revenge following the murder of his  mentor, friend and partner.  With help from a big player who was also a  former associate of the deceased he sets up an elaborate sting for the man  responsible.<br />The plot twists are great with a cameo sub-plot between  Redford and Durning that entwines beautifully with the main story.  As  previously mentioned the musical score is wonderful, a re-working of Scott  Joplin's Entertainer that really captures the mood of the film.<br />This film  was made to do one thing: entertain, and it does exactly that.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Adia sounds great with it's harmonies and the whole album is just a greatest hits of Sarah's but it's totally worth it.  The reason for this is because the songs don't totally sound the same as they would on the  original CD's.  The songs are totally great and you wouldn't have to buy  the other CDs to get all the songs...if you love Sarah go out and get this  thing today..don't wait..she's worth it.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I've always been impressed by the variety of music that comes from Savage Garden. At least based on their radio singles, every song has a unique feel to it, and were it not for Darren's standout voice, one might even think  each song was performed by completely different bands. The same cannot be  said for this entire CD, but there is still a nice mix of upbeat and slower  songs. I always think it's a big plus when a band writes their own songs,  and none of these appear to have suffered from the pitfalls of trying too  hard to rhyme in the right place, and many of them really do inspire you to  think a little. Or at least ponder just about everything in life (i.e. the  song, Affirmations). One other note...don't be fooled by the apparent  &quot;boy band&quot; style in I Knew I Loved You. While I personally think  this is still leagues above any boy band song, it's got the same kind of  feel to it, and it's really not typical of any of their other songs.
B0000004V2|5.0|I am one of those people who likes music that is not very popular. A lot of people will get turned off by a band just because they have never heard or have never heard anything by them. I suggest that you should listen and  explore your outer reaches of your musical tastes. <br />I think this is one  of those albums. People I now think that just because they have never heard  of the Stone Roses means they were not a good band. This is a awesome band  and yes they were not ever really in the mainstream but at least they have  musical talent. This is one of my favorite albums. I like almost every song  on it it.<br />So to the people who do not like the Stone Roses because they  have never heard of them I say you do not know what you are missing.
0340738448|3.0|Sometimes, I just don't get British humor. My English relatives love the jokes of their countryman -- sometimes I simply don't get it. But, the jokes here are universal. There are many scenes which are made up of very embarrassing, but very funny, everyday scenarios. The story is about Travel  bookstore ownder William Thacker, played by Hugh Grant, who lives in  London, England's posh, expensive, and very high class Notting Hill  district. One day, he meets and falls in love with lovely American actress  Anna Scott, in one of the best scenes of the film. (It involves a cup of  orange juice, apricots soaked in honey, and &quot;raisins&quot; -- remember  that word for one of the film's BEST lines!<br />And Richard Curtis knows how  to write dialogue -- this man can think up some really funny one-liners!  Some of the supporting characters were off-the-wall (but not written  spaztically -- a good thing). If you enjoyed the movie, check it out. It's  worth the cash.
B00000DMJF|3.0|Here's the thing, the so-called &quot;White Album&quot; contains some very fine songs.  What come to  mind are:  &quot;While my guitar . . .&quot; &quot;USSR&quot;, &amp; &quot;Revolution&quot; are at the top of the list.   Other good songs include &quot;Birthday&quot; &quot;Don't Pass Me By&quot;  &quot;Blackbird&quot; &amp; &quot;Sexy Sadie.&quot;  The problem is the  number of throwaways -- &quot;I'm So Tired&quot; &amp; &quot;Rev #9&quot;  for sure.  Also questionable (I realize the hubris of questioning the  Beatles here) are &quot;Ob-Li-Da&quot; (which Lennon hated) &amp;  &quot;Helter Skelter.&quot;<br />IF this was a single album -- 10-12 songs --  it'd have been as good as &quot;Let it Be&quot; (which also has some  holes).  As it is, this ranks near the lower 1/4 of the Beatles material  (which would be better than most bands for sure).<br />If you have the main  classics then buy it -- but not for $31.00
6303477259|5.0|This is some of the best footage you'll find of a live concert. The camera angles and video editing are great and the lighting is superb. No dark shadows or slow-motion strobes as you'll find in so many other concert  videos which consider only the live audience's perspective. The close-ups  of Gilmour on his Strat playing \\"Time\\" and \\"Coming Back to Life\\" are alone  worth the price of the video. As an amateur guitarist and long-time Floyd  fan, I've always argued that when considering both creativity and dexterity  on the six string, Gilmour leaves all others in the dust. If you're a fan  of The Pink Floyd or just appreciate great guitar, this is a must-have.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I received this cd yesterday and haven't stopped listening to it since.  I was blown away by the tracks that Ruth Ann from olive appeared on, especially 'gravity of love'.  That song seems to be on repeat alot.  The  album is alot faster tempo than I would have expected, but nonetheless I  would rate this worth the wait...almost as good as MCMXC.  If you have all  4 albums, play them in order for a real treat.
B000002LSV|4.0|I had never been much of a fan of this Texan group before, previously well-known for boogieing with the best of them, rock-music-wise. I had only heard &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; and the original version of  &quot;Legs&quot; on the radio. And that was before I finally rented and  watched the &quot;Back To The Future&quot; movie trilogy, and saw this  funky trio as the band in 1885 Hill Valley in the third. And I absoutely  LOVED the sound of &quot;Doubleback&quot; off of it's soundtrack. So, about  a year later, I found this collection in my local used-music store, and  snapped it up. Reading the rather self-serving liner notes, I was skeptical  of the down-south blues-band sound at first, but after about two or three  listens, I was truly a real fan for sure. My favorites from this CD besides  the aforementioned three would have to be &quot;Gimme All Your  Lovin'&quot;, &quot;Pearl Necklace&quot;, the sung-by-Dusty Hill-remake of  &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; (very funky), &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot;,  and &quot;Planet Of Women&quot;. The remaining rest are all right too, I  suppose. Anyway, I am indeed aware that this material only goes up to 1992,  and I haven't heard any of the songs from &quot;Antenna&quot;,   &quot;Rhythmeen&quot;, or from the apparently dissapointing  &quot;XXX&quot;, according to recent customer reviews. So, for the  earlier-era (mostly from the '80's) sound of ZZ Top, pick this compilation  up today, these three certainly at one time had a sound all their own!  Quite cool, indeed!
B000031XCR|5.0|You know every once in a while a cd comes out that you really want to buy, but you only know one song on the track, and thats makes you hold off on buying it. When I finally went to the mall to buy it, still felling like I  was wasting my money, I looked at the list of other songs, and it made me  think,&quot; oh this has to be mine&quot;!And when that scort of thing  happens to you, you can only think, &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;!
630575067X|2.0|Nowhere near as good as the original trilogy, The Phantom Menace is only about special effects.  The &quot;force&quot; stuff gets too weird, maybe even blasphemous.  Jar Jar and others are obvious racial stereotypes which  some will find offensive.  The only reason to buy this movie is so you can  enjoy the state-of-the-art *digital* effects at home.  However, you cannot  enjoy them in the inferior and outdated VHS format.  Wait for the DVD.
B00003A9QL|5.0|I have been a fan of Metallica for a few years (even though I don't generally like &quot;Metal&quot;) and involved in classical music all my life.  I never thought I could get goosebumps listening to Metallica, but  this CD has done it.  Kamen does an excellent job arranging every single  piece.  It's NOT Metallica vs. the Orchestra... rather, each ensemble adds  power to the other.  If you're not sure about this CD, consider this:  I  heard from someone who plays with the Symphony that some of the orchestra  members were not looking forward to this concert at all!  But afterward,  they all had to admit they loved it.  If Metallica can change the minds of  stuffy classical-music people, it can change yours!  Buy this CD regardless  of what kind of music you like.
B000002H33|4.0|I have been regarded to this album by a co-worker, I had got it from my girlfriend on my half-birthday. I do like all of the songs altough it did take me awhile to actual do so. I would also like to comment on the title  track's actual meaning, it is all about what an addiction to a drug would  do to the user. In fact the song has a lyric chop your breakfast on a  mirror, signafying the use of cocaine. With all that the album is about it  is the greatest of the albums created by the original members.
6305076626|5.0|This movie was so cool.  I wouldn't recomend it for children because there is nued people in it and alot of people in drag.  But it was so funny, I recomend it if you can find it.
B000000ORE|5.0|the title says it all. each song has its own sound ,chemisrty to it. &quot;lady luck' is my favorite cause of its attitude and chorus. everysong leaves you breathless &quot;yesterdaze is gone&quot; is like so turbulent  watch out !  any fan of metal ,blues metal, hell rock n' roll get it  now!
0782008372|2.0|I was really amazed that a THX certified DVD could  have as bad picture quality as this movie. It is totally grainy throughout + it is non-anamorphic. There is no way I'm buying this version, perhaps if they  remaster it.
6305657939|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  It was witty and clever and totally adult.  Rene Russo was fun and Pierce Brosnan was up for the game.  With so many videos that are predictable and mundane, it's nice to see one with a spunky  sense of humor and a good dose of fun.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|As a Phil Collins fan for many years, I was really glad to see a compilation of hits that included many of the songs I have loved for a long time.  To just mention a few tunes, one of my favorites of all time,  &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, is on this CD, and if you have never heard  the song, the CD is worth buying for this song alone.  No wonder it was  nominated for an Academy Award as part of the soundtrack for the movie  bearing its title.  &quot;Against All Odds&quot; is a song that certainly  makes you feel something, and his voice stirs deep emotion, at least in me.   Another of my favorites, &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, is a fast-paced hit that  makes the best of a combination of Phil Collins and Phil Bailey on vocals.   Definitely a likable hit.  The passionate &quot;Separate Lives&quot; is  also a duet, a beautiful one, and one of the reasons I truly love this CD.   If you turn up the volume when Phil comes on the radio, you can bet that  you will covet this CD full of hits.  &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; is one  reason to turn up the volume, with its smashing drum beats and the sultry,  almost angry, lilt in Phil's vocals.  Upbeat hits like &quot;Two  Hearts&quot;,&quot;Can't Hurry Love&quot; and &quot;Dance into the  Light&quot; really throw an added spark into the mix.  Phil's remake of  Cindy Lauper's &quot;True Colors&quot; is well done and of course what Phil  Collins hits CD would be complete without the catchy &quot;Sussudio&quot;.   Songs like &quot;Groovy Kind of Love&quot;, &quot;I Wish it Would Rain  Down&quot;, &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, &quot;One More Night&quot; and  &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; round out this album.   Many of the songs included on the CD were favorites of mine that I hadn't  heard in a long time and hearing them again was truly great.  A must-have  CD for any Collins or Genesis fan.  It earns every one of the five stars I  gave it.
B0000041DZ|5.0|Brendel is not the flashiest of pianists: generally, he eschews bombast. There are those who will prefer a greater sense of physical excitement, especially in movements like the finale of the Hammerklavier Sonata (Op. 106). But there is never any exaggeration, or excessive underlining of points: one gets the feeling listening to these that there is no-one standing between yourself and the music. <br />The piano sound is, generally, very successfully captured, and Brendel's tone and clarity of line are exquisite. He gives the early sonatas their proper weight (listen, for instance, to the tragic intensity of the slow movement of Op. 10 No. 3); gives an absolutely sensational performance of - amongst others - the Pastoral Sonata (Op. 28); and as for those visionary late sonatas... there are several great recordings of these, but none more satisfying than these.<br />The liner notes, incidentally, are by the distinguished Beethoven scholar William Kinderman, and are excellent. If I were forced to live with only one item from my CD collection, this box would be it.
B000009PNY|4.0|Failure's take on &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; is worth the price of the CD on its own.  The rest of it is far from disappointing as well.
6303168507|5.0|It is important to remember that Schindler's List is a film designed to help pay homage to those who sufferred.  It was also intended to be a living reminder of the death and destruction that humans are capapble of incurring on one another.  Is the fact that it is spoken in English really  all that big of a deal?  The symbolism of the black and white has been  completely missed.  It allows us to see the detachment felt by the Nazi  soldiers as they slaughtered the masses.  However, in the presence of The  Girl in the Red Coat, Schindler himself is reminded all to much about the  world around him.  In response to those who claim Spielberg made this film  for the awards so due to him:  You are wrong.  If that was the case then he  would not be working on a project to preserve the memories of Jewish  survivors or have made Saving Private Ryan...another film about World War  II.  He wouldn't need to simply because he already had his ideas.  I feel  it is an important film that should be shown through the generations in  schools across the country.  former student
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of the truly rare films that works brilliantly on every possible level. As a satire, it delves deep into the heart of society, and illuminates the strong undertones of resentment, despair and desire that  flourish beneath glossy facade of American life. It displays the reasons  why so many lives unfold without any happiness, because people choose to  live without going after their dreams and ambitions. On the other side  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is also a modern tragedy, a story of one man's  search for identity and freedom, and the way he profoundly impacts the  people around him. The film slowly unravels the masks people where, and  explores the moral obscurity and emotional chaos they could plunge into  when they decide of follow their heart instead of their conscience. Kevin  Spacey is phenomenal as Lester Burnham, his performance is 100% worthy of  an Oscar. Alan Ball's script never ceases to amaze me, it's abundance of  shrewd observations and insights is something to marvel at. Visually, the  film is stunning, it's imagery is nothing short of cinematic poetry, you  will find yourself in awe in every frame, every moment. &quot;American  Beauty&quot; never shies away from reality, no matter how sad, and in the  end, you will find yourself looking at the things that surround you with a  whole new outlook. This is a truly remarkable film, one of the decade's  best.
0590353403|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly.I thought it was very exciting when H agrid came to get Harry from the Dursleys.This book had  a great plot and good characterization.I highly reccomend it.
6303921248|5.0|Of all of the recent Jane Austen adaptations, this is simply the best.  Wonderful scenery and costumes, and a thrilling story line filled with surprises. Once you begin watching, you won't want to stop until it is  finished!
6305750750|2.0|This movie is the first of the star wars movies. It more family friendly and it has the annoying person Jar Jar BInks(who I would love to kill or get out of the movie! Jar JAr is just extra stuff and comedic relief. Other  than it OK just I wish they would of developed the story and Darth Maul  ! Darth Maul is one of the lamest villians of last summer! Now please hurry  up George Lucas and start putting your movies on DVD! But if you decide not  fine, just expect to lose millions of millions of dollars in this new  format superior to VHS tapes!
B000003S5H|3.0|I definitely don't understand.  There are many, MANY wizened, sophisticated techno music fans who love to sneer in superior fashion when confronted with dance music that in any way, shape, or form can be judged  &quot;cheezy.&quot;  Yet a lot of these same self-styled cutting-edge  sophisticates just melt at the very mention of the French duo, Air.  This  cd is &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;mellow,&quot; but definitely reeks of  pop/schlock/sentimentalism. &quot;Kelly Watch the Stars?&quot;  Are you  kidding? Where's the great appeal?  This stuff is cotton candy for the ears  and mind, but little more.  Go to the chillout room and enjoy, folks.
B0000060AK|5.0|I first heard this recording in LA on the Friday night radio opera program.  I have seldom, if ever, heard such a perfect performance.  All of the singers' voices are perfectly suited to their roles, never shunning the  trills or the sixteenth notes---the orchestra and direction are  magnificent.<br />Make no mistake--this is no Messiah.  It has the lyricism,  passion and thrilling appogiaturas of the grandest of operas.  It is  currently my favorite recording (disc 2 in particular---Anne Sophie is  incomparable in her rendition of &quot;Scherza infida.&quot;)  If more than  a five-star rating were possible, this recording deserves the highest. A  somewhat expensive three-disc set, but worth it.
0812550757|5.0|This book is incredible. It starts 3000 years where Ender's Game left off. Constant plots twists and an unknowning of what will happen keeps you reading till the very end. You don't even have to read Ender's Game to  understand. It works perfectly well by itself. I give this book my highest  recommendation.
B00003CWPR|2.0|I'd hoped that the DVD would be the international cut, or (better yet) would take advantage of the ability of the DVD format to allow the user to select alternate edits.  That way we could see the film as Kubrick  intended.  But no, apparently we just get the same censored version that  played in US theaters, while the rest of the world gets Kubrick's original  version.<br />So despite it being a great film, I can't really give the US  release of the DVD (or VHS) a great rating.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Whether or not you like a \\"Best Of\\" is also dependent on whether or not you like the artist - so, if you doesn't like Phil Collins radio-pop-songs (\\"One More Night\\", \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" etc.) this certainly isn't the record to buy! If you, however, know only a couple of the songs, and like those, you can be sure: You will probably like all those songs.<br />\\"Hits\\" is a great collection of Phil's songs, because it includes a lot of songs not from his ordinary albums (\\"Against All Odds\\", \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"Easy Lover\\", \\"Separate Lifes\\" from movies and more), which makes it worth the money, even if you have his albums.<br />All the hits included on this album deserves to be there, but there are some missing tracks. Of course, the CD can only have so many minutes, but still, \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" should not be let out - this is a REAL classic of Phil! Disappointing. Instead, a new and somewhat boring track (\\"True Coulors\\") has been included, which I don't think was necesary to get the fans to buy this album. Other missing hits are \\"Do You Remember\\" and \\"Everyday\\", but that's O.K. - there isn't space on the CD, and a double-CD would be overrated.<br />Still, the masterpieces included are: \\"Against All Odds\\", \\"Dance Into The Light\\", \\"Both Sides\\", \\"Susudio\\", \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", \\"One More Night\\", \\"Separate Lives\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" ... so there's no doubt that this is an excellent collection of fantastic songs.<br />A must for everyone who likes Phil Collins voice.
0790737973|2.0|They killed Sphere.<br />They took the book's Lemmish metaphysics and slowly destroyed them. They ate away at the constant suspense. They bombarded the premise. They annihilated a masterpiece.<br />What appears to have happened is  that the someone tried to make Sphere the book into a slasher movie, a la  Scream. The book gnaws at the reader's mind while he tries to comprehend  what exactly is it that the alien Sphere does, while the characters are  killed one by one by their minds' creations. In the film, what sems to  happen is the characters trying to find out how to get rid of the Sphere.  Every second I expected them to pull guns and begin a shootout, or perhaps  calling 911, or something equally absurd.<br />However good is the quality of  the acting (not very), however good are the effects (too little of them to  combat the film's other flaws), however good are the sets (oblivious - I  constantly felt like the characters were sitting in a submerged tub some 5  feet below the surface), the producer's interpretation of the book outright  nukes the quality.
0870119435|5.0|I have read Norwegian Wood few years ago and I still take the book and turn the pages to enjoy its passages occationaly. The main character &quot;Watanabe&quot; gradually falls in love with his dead best friend's  girl friend &quot;Naoko&quot; while having an awkaward time with her.  Eventually, she suffers from some kind of mental problem and commites  suicide.  By the time, however, Watanabe is about to fall in love with  another girl &quot;Midori&quot; seriously. Watanabe is the narrater of this  story.  He descrives complicated movements of his own emotions extreamly  honestly insted of intense love affiars. He also pays close attention to  slight, ordinary and realistic incidents around him calmly. All of those  somewhat appeals to me very much. I have never read a book like this  before. This story is little sad but somehow heals my heart a lot.
0060920084|3.0|This book was ok, I finished it, i laughed a bit, but it was ENTIRELY TOO REPETITIVE. If you want to read a better, and funnier Bryson book try A Walk in The Woods.
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|I do not know what I can add that has not already been said about this movie -- it is great.  Heck, when I found out this movie was coming out on DVD back in September I went and bought a DVD player and full surround  sound system.  <br />The story is very good -- even though ideas and themes in  the movie are borrowed from many sources, the execution of the story is  enticing and refreshing.  The action sequences are top-notch and are  matched to a quality soundtrack.  The special effects are not only great,  but they do not steal from they show -- they only enhance the story.<br />The  combination of story, action, and FX make this film fun to watch over and  over -- it never seems to get boring.  This is a classic and Cyberpunk at  its best.
B000002I8D|2.0|&quot;Face Value&quot; isn't bad, I guess, but it most certainly isn't my taste. I absolutely love &quot;No Jacket...&quot; and a lot of Phil's later hits, but when I heard this, I was really disappointed. I wont say it's  bad, I just want to warn everyone who likes Phil's later (more mainstream  pop) songs, that they should listen to this before they buy it.
0792835077|4.0|The quote is from my local Channel Eight news, and it refers to the WCW training camp, but I find it to suit Westworld pretty well. The film's plot features a super-amusement park for the super rich (somewhat Jurassic Park  style - and, as &quot;thecynicalcritic&quot; noted below, the Simpsons HAVE  done a parody of BOTH films within the same episode...hectic) where the  visitors can participate in realistic combat by destroying the character  robots, which get repaired and put back into service every night. You can  imagine the sort of events that can ensue when (if) those robots go  &quot;berserk&quot;. As said above, hectic.<br />The acting is tight and the  sets are quite high-quality, but, again, the film's greatest asset is the  amazing script.
0670880728|2.0|An amusing read. Just check your feminist principles at the door first. Bridget is incredibly shallow. Just about the point I work up some sympathy for her, she dissolves into complete vapidness. (The whole bit about  enjoying the drama of her friend's imagined death? Or her mother's criminal  escapades? Please.) And the end is farcical. And Mark Darcy is, yes, the  knight in shining armor... Also, I don't care how many lottery tickets she  buys, but the device has to be consistent. Okay, all that said, it does  have some funny bits. It's sort of brain candy. The pleasures you get from  this are the same derived from reading People magazine. Fluffy confection.  Not literature.
0688170528|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read.  I finished it three days ago and I am still thinking about it.  It captivates you so much and you feel exactly what the characters are feeling.  I was so shooken up by the  various turning points in the story that I literally found myself shaking.
B00000K19E|5.0|I don't have any comments about this movie to add to the reviwer comments, but I want to say that this great action adventure moive became the best DVD item in my DVD library.
6303942830|5.0|Ever since the first night I saw this film, it has become one of my favourites. Last of the Mohicans is one of those rare pictures that causes the viewer to understand why the film industry came about. It really is the  passion, the excitement, the emotion that today we call the movies.        Daniel Day Lewis is superb in this film. He brings a raw intensity to the  screen that touches the viewer, and keeps them caring. A real feat in  movies today.      Michael Mann's direction is close to perfect. The end  sequence - a montage with no words, or wild screaming, no exploding  cars...just the shocking finality of a knife's point, above the sweeping  score. Indeed, it is the music that is the real star. One of the few  soundtracks that really gets the heart pounding - it stirs the blood and  almost haunts you.       The acting, the dialogue, the direction, the  music, the beautiful cinematography - all these are essential to a great  film. The Last of the Mohicans has them in abundance.<br />  The Academy  frequently overlook the classics, the movies that are remembered for years  to come. This is one of them. One of the greatest...ever.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Celine, in English, can be corny, nasal, and overdramatic.  However, when singing in her native French, the nasal-sounding voice seems to work well with French sounds, and the corniness becomes heartfelt emotion.   Jean-jacques is a terrific composer.  I'm a student of French, and what I  loved about this CD was that i was able to understand the majority of the  songs.  Some songs (je chanterai) seems almost reminiscent of mid-80's  Mariah carey, but other songs (Papillion, En Attendant Ses Pas) are  gorgeous.  &quot;En Attendant&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all  time.
B0000028RR|5.0|When I first heard this album back in 1993, I just did not like it. Repeating the same lyric over and over at the end of each song in every song, and not at all enjoyable listening. But over the years this record  has grown on me considerably. Now viewed as kick-starting the rap-rock  fusion, it cannot be understated just how important RATM have become. Every  song on the fierce debut is focused and undiluted by commercialism.  Bombtrack is a seriously rockin' track as is Bullet In The Head. This is  still the best RATM release, although I still love the other two albums.
B00000DFRS|5.0|What can I say....the girl can blow!Everything this girl puts her hands on turns gold.From track to the last song is amazing.Whitney girl you deserve a Grammy for this.Keep on keeping on.
0380729407|5.0|This book was awesome. It caotures youth and innocence with simple words and phrases. I've always enjoyes Bradbury's works and this was no exception. This book is worth the trouble of reading. It's fast-paces  (unlike what others have said about), easy to read, fun, and almost scary  in a rather peculiar way. I was reading this book every time I had a  chance. Young or old, read this book to relive memories past and present.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is the best action movie I've ever seen.  I've never been a big fan of techno music before, but it is used so effectively in this movie that I found myself drawn to the soundtrack afterward.  If you can appreciate  cinematography like a fast-paced music video, you will absolutely love this  film - guaranteed.
0790743132|5.0|Casablanca is the kind of movie that people are talking about when they use the phrase &quot;classic movies&quot;.  What makes it so classic?  For starters, there is such a well constructed script, full of memorable  dialogue and scenes, which is all the more impressive given the chaos under  which it seems to have been written (I've read the writers didn't even know  how they were going to end it and that it changed on almost a daily basis).   Then there is Humphrey Bogart, the epitome of &quot;coolness&quot; as  Rick, the cynical, detached night club owner.  There's Claude Rains, witty,  charming, and sly as the chief of police, in a perfect performance.   There's a great supporting cast, including Sydney Greenstreet and Peter  Lorre.  There's a terrific musical score, as well as fine direction (in a  style that you wouldn't expect from Michael Curtiz).  If anyone considers  themselves a fan of movies, this film is required viewing.
B000002C25|3.0|Released at the height of Oasis-mania, `Be Here Now' proved to be something of a disappointment. The album sounds like a bunch of left over songs put together to please the fans hungry for anything Oasis-related,  which went on to sell by the truck load regardless of the quality. First  single `D'You Know What I Mean' is a standard Oasis song with the band  believing their own invincibility with the line \\"All my people right here  right now, d'you know what I mean\\". Next track `My Big Mouth' is a rocking  song from the `Definitely Maybe' period but `Magic Pie' has Noel Gallagher  sounding too close to The Beatles for comfort. The stand-out track `Fade  In-Out' is what Oasis should be doing more often than average Indie songs  like the singles `Stand By Me' and `All Around The World' (which again  sounds like The Beatles `Hey Jude' towards the end). The other highlight is  `It's Gettin' Better (Man! )', which despite the uninspiring song title has  a memorable chorus. `Be Here Now' marked 1997 as the year Oasis came down  to Earth as their creative juices began drying up, showing a band with one  trick up their sleeve. `Definitely Maybe' was a landmark album that was  fresh back in 1994, but today this kind of music sounds tired and  unoriginal next to the emergence of the current \\"brit-rock\\" revival.

B00000INEX|5.0|This is one of the best investments I've made so far.  Since my 3 month old daughter began watching the TV I figured she should watch something useful. This video is it. She loves all the colorful pictures and enjoys  seeing the shots of the two girls.  I don't even mind watching it with her.   The music is great and my daughter seems to like it to.  I can't wait to  get Baby Einstein and Baby Mozart also!
B000002LSV|5.0|You must get this CD.  Don't think, just buy
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten became the biggest selling grunge album due to being accessible and containing eleven consistently brilliant tracks. Undoubtfully the first half contains the best and most popular songs with `Alive', `Even Flow' and  `Jeremy' cited as key tracks to the album's success. Dig deeper and other  examples of Pearl Jam's classic rock can be found - `Porch' along with the  stirring `Deep' contributing to an album best consumed as a whole. `Black'  has become the burner of Ten, not a standout at first but over time turning  into the centrepiece and most enduring cut. `Release Me' begs to become an  anthem for a lost generation and `Why Go' storms off the blocks faster than  any other song on the album. Always perceived second best to Nirvana, Pearl  Jam are more than just a Grunge band and should be separate from the scene,  instead a modern day Led Zeppelin or REM for the alternative fans.
B000002URV|3.0|Not only the most publicly received of Enigma's albums but also the one of best quality. Some very good dance music (slow style) ,however by the end of the album the whole concept has grow a little thin, there being little  variation throughout. Still, a decent effort. Worth having.
0380018179|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;The thorn birds&quot; for the 4th time (twice in Russian and twice in English), my eyes are still full of tears...  The story of Meggie is so incredible and SO sad at the same time.  She is  such a strong woman, I don't think I can ever be like her. This book always  makes me think about my life and people I love.  I highly recommend  &quot;The thorn birds&quot; for anyone who's looking for a good book to  read.   .
6302256615|5.0|&quot;Little Hand Says it's time to rock and roll&quot; just one of the quotes from this movie that make it a non stop action with a very good plot and everything an action bank robbery movie could need. could have used a  little better work on the ending and i would have made it ALOT longer but i  guess it's an action movie so it can't be that long... to some this movie  up it is a non stop action thiller with great robbery scenes and a very  weird ending
B00002Z88D|5.0|This CD makes my skin crawl (in a pleasant way). These guys are absolute geniuses to come up with this- everyone who's reading this has their own favorite Metallica song, imagine hearing it in a new and exciting way.   Very impressive work.  I highly recommend this CD.
630512065X|4.0|Over all, I loved it. I just wish that all of the words and songs could have made it on the tape in their entirety, but alas what can I say, 2 hours just isn't enough! In this video production of Cats, Ken Page (from  the Broadway soundtrack) and Elaine Paige and Susan Jane Tanner (from the  London soundtrack) reprise their roles as Deuteronomy, Grizabella and  Jellylorum (respectfully) (there may be others but these are the only  soundtracks I got :) ). It is very close to the stage production that came  through Wichita a few years back and blends the style from the Broadway and  some of the lyrics from the London productions into one. I like the fact  that you can tell it was done in a theater it gives the show character. The  sound and performance is excellent. I personally think that the video  sounds better than either soundtrack. The performers do a great job of  portraying their cat's character and they don't go too fast on &quot;The  Naming of Cats&quot; and &quot;The Jellicle Ball&quot;.  All the songs were  done at just the right speed and Veerle Casteleyn who plays Jemima  accompanies Grizabella with a beautiful soprano voice on &quot;Memory&quot;  and Grizabella sings with more feeling than is conveyed on the soundtracks.  The performance was done on stage but not in front of an audience so  there's not any applauding during the show. It does not contain  &quot;Growltiger's Last Stand&quot; but includes for the first time, to my  knowledge, &quot;The Pekes and The Pollicles&quot; (aka &quot;The Great  Rumpas Cat Song&quot;) which does not occur on the available soundtracks,  but was in the stage production.
6305513406|5.0|This is the first DVD that i ever bought and I am glad that I did!  It is wonderful!  The picture quality is so clear that it hurt my eyes!   Can't wait for the DVD releases of all 79 plus The Next Generation, Deep Space  Nine and Voyager!
6302548195|5.0|This unreal piece of film plays with the mind, you are captured in awe of the work ethic of the man with the greatest physique of the century.  Your eyes will open wide when you see how large his body can become when  stressed to the limits and beyond.  I have been fortunate enough to live  with a guy who owns a copy and we have seen it many times.  With each  viewing, the mind is still amazed at what this man was able to accomplish,  and it is funny too!  Five stars, without a doubt.

0792151712|5.0|This movie is fascinating, one of the best movies of all time.  The movie TITANIC will definitely go down in history like Gone With The Wind!  I'm a teenage girl, but HONESTLY, it's not just because of Leonardo DiCaprio that  made me love this movie.  The movie is just FASCINATING!  Anyway, even my  parents think this movie is a great!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO OWN A  COPY OF THIS VIDEO, BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY --  TRULY UNSINKABLE!
B00000J7RZ|3.0|THIS CD IS VERY CURRENT WITH TODAY'S MUSIC TRENDS AND I AGREE WITH A PREVIOUS REVIEWER, ALL THE DANCE MUSIC IS REALLY GREAT,BUT SHE WILL DEFINITELY NEVER(UNLESS SHE GETS SOME VOCAL TRAINING) WIN ANY AWARDS FOR  HER VOICE. I THINK JENNIFER SHOULD STICK TO R&amp;B,LATIN, AND DANCE  TRACKS.
0060920432|2.0|Flow is an ecstatic state that occurs when according to Dr. C. you are really, really paying attention to some creative or demanding act. And all credit to Dr. C. for brining our attention to flow and how it influences peoples lives. But there is a teensy little problem. Dr. C. tell us what  other people tell him 'flow' feels like, but in 300 pages, he never tells  us what flow is. This is sort of like reading a book on headaches by  Dostoevsky or some existentialist philosopher. You may get the feel of what  headaches are like, but to know the physiology of headaches, a better  choice would be to rely on DrKoop. Same thing unfortunately with Dr. C.  Instead of a scientific analysis of flow that brings in the latest research  on cognitive science or neuroscience, Dr. C. ladles on the metaphors like a  never ending fountain of curdled verbal gravy. Thus flow &quot;transports  one into a new reality&quot;, represents an &quot;ordering of  consciousness&quot;, or represents some &quot;undreamed of state of  consciousness&quot;. Hmm, may I have some psychic fries with all this  psychic goodness?<br />So Dr. C's book gets two stars for literature, but  flunks out as science. Indeed, the latest research in neuroscience has  demonstrated that the brain releases the neuromodulator dopamine whenever  attention shifts from one salient precept to another. Whenever attention  shifts a lot, as when we encounter something challenging, creative, or very  interesting, a lot of dopamine is produced. Since dopamine is the pleasure  chemical in the brain, as well as is responsible for drug induced highs, it  stands to reason that flow is no more than a natural drug high that keeps  us riveted on important thoughts. So flow is important, but is hardly best  understood by the half baked Jungian analysis that Dr. C. cooks up.<br />For a  better insight on how you too can make 300+ page books by weaving together  meaningless metaphors, I would refer the reader to George Lakoff's superb  book &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh&quot;. For a better understanding about  the emotions that may underlie flow, I also recommend Antonio Damasio's  book &quot;Descartes Error...&quot;; and for those of you who would like to  get a better idea about how flow like processes may arise from the brain,  Donahoe and Palmer's book &quot;Learning and Complex Behavior&quot; is  heartily recommended.

B000002MG1|5.0|I've been an REM fan for years, but I just rediscovered this CD a few weeks ago and I can't stop listening to it. For me, REM achieves one of their greatest moments in the last two songs on this CD. Nightswimming and  Find the River flow together perfectly. I put those two songs (always  together) on almost every mixed tape I create. I would say that the one low  point on this album is Man on the Moon -- a song which receives a great  deal of praise. Still, there are many songs on this album which are  marvelous beyond words...

6305205620|5.0|Wow.  I'm usually not at a loss for words, but this DVD blew me away.  The first time I watched it, I felt like I was in the Snake Pit screaming along with thousands of die-hard fans like myself.  The sound, the visuals, the  band--everything was done exceptionally.  Metallica proves that they are  the best touring band around.  Their raw sound and power is captured on  this DVD, and it is a more intense cerebral experience than a mere studio  recording can provide you with.  METALLICA FANS REJOICE--THERE IS A GOD,  AND HE HAS GIVEN US &quot;CUNNING STUNTS!&quot;
630575067X|1.0|1 Star? That's right. 1 Star. This movie can't be shown the way it needs to be shown on VHS format. Lucas is just trying pinch every last little dollar out his loyal audience. This movie should be on DVD. VHS can't do it  justice. It's a shame Lucas isn't on the DVD bandwagon because a many of  his fans watch the Star Wars movies because they want to enjoy the art of  it. I'll not spoil a good movie with a VHS viewing just to turn around and  buy it a year later on DVD.<br />1 - Star. for a poor choice. 1 - Star for  trying to get one up on the fans.

6305750750|4.0|Although I don't share the &quot;this movie sucks&quot; opinion that others share, I must say &quot;Episode 1&quot; lived up to my expectations of a movie coming out of my favorite triology of films in the history of  filmmaking.<br />Well what can I say, its got the reflecting light of the  original trilogy, its got fun and fast action scenes. Killer special  effects. But the character development is a lil poor (but what does that  matter anyway). Overall, a fun entertaining experience as long as people  stop comparing it to the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; and the better  sci-fi release in 1999 &quot;The Matrix&quot;.
B000002VMD|1.0|i don't know what was worse the film or the soundtrack? lets get the facts out Whitney can sing but she more often than not favors run of the mill material.Babyface is the most important Writer&amp;Producer over the past  decade.but this sappy material is way overblown.
B000002LND|5.0|Contains all of her hits from the 80s. Too bad &quot;Who's That Girl&quot; and &quot;Dress You Up&quot; weren't encapsulated, that would've made it off the meters! Nevertheless, it's a fun album, great to dance to, ride out  to, or listen to at the computer in your resident discman (or CD-rom, if  you're so inclined). The song that struck a chord with me on this album is  &quot;Justify My Love&quot; that song is bangin' and is sort of like a  leeway into the overt sexualness that would overcome her in the early- to  mid-90s. Masterful album. Recommended (as well as &quot;Something To  Remember&quot;).
0780625854|1.0|Demi Moore can't act.this film does her no justice and is about as believable as Burt Reynolds's hair.what a waste of film.
0060254920|5.0|I loved this book!  My son brought it home from the school library when he was in grade school back in the 1980's.  He just loved it and wanted me to read it to him over and over again.  He was a very active little boy and was always getting into trouble.  My nephew is now 4 years old and the same  way.  We call him our wild child.  I had been looking for this book for the  past two years and was so thrilled to finally find it at Amazon.com!  I'm  sending it to my nephew for his fourth birthday.  The story is about a  little boy who gets sent to his room for misbehaving.  While being  punished, he goes into an imaginative world of his own where the wild  things are!  It is a delightful story with lots of action.  As an adult in  my forties, I still love to read it over and over again.
6304618344|4.0|John Woo does a good job of Directing this film.Nicolas Cage does a good job without over acting like he sometimes does.as for Travolta this is his best comeback film.the other ones he just walked thru.he actually acts in  this one.him&amp;cage have good chemistry thru out.very interesting film.
068815333X|5.0|This is the first Dennis Lehane book that I have read and I consider myself in for more  great reading. His characters jump out of the pages and the story line never fails to hold your interest. I am going to the  bookstore right now to purchase some of his former novels.  I would highly  recommend this book to anyone!
6300214540|1.0|i wanna give 1&amp; half stars but that system isn't available.anyway this film is pretty brain-dead and catchy with all kinds of cliches.Tom Cruise: when i see him i see Money but no talent at all.he is able to sell anything  and he did with this film.very 80's catchy soundtrack&amp;some stunts with  some locker room humor that worked well in 86 but hasn't aged that  well.Kelly MCGillis is okay.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This album is sensational!It has a variety of beats lyrics and I believe this is the heart of a good album!
6301966988|2.0|this film is very average.the story takes on more than it has answers for.it hasn't aged well at all.Demi Moore&amp;Patrick Swayze have no real Chemistry.also Demi is a weak actress&amp;Swayze is a Average actor at  best.Whoopi Goldberg gets a Toekn Appearence&amp;Award for this so/so film.
630420065X|2.0|Mission Impossible the movie has nothing in common with the classic series from the 1960's.  As noted in many of the reviews, the film is impossible to understand in that there doesn't seem to be a coherent plot line.  The  element of suspense is forced here.  Granted, the TV series depended on a  sudden twist (as well as the obligatory commercial break) to maintain  suspense.  A one-hour series is invariablly difficult to transfer to the  big screen, but at least the TV series had some sense of coherency that was  lacking in the movie. Also, Mr. Phelps' transformation from good guy in the  series to villian in the film is too hard to believe (and for fans of MI, a  major disappointment). Now are the CIA the bad guys and are the good guys  really good here?  And I find it hard to believe that Jim Phelps could  knock off all the members of his team single-handedly.  <br />Great special  effects and sound do not a good movie make and Tom Cruise is back to his  'Top Gun' days here when nobody took him as a serious actor (I still don't  consider him a serious actor-and that includes 'Jerry MacGuire&quot;).  So  there's going to be a sequel and John Woo's directing?  Hopefully he can do  a better job similar to his Hong Kong movies, which show a grittiness and  realism that is so lacking in this film, but I'm not holding out much hope  given the quality of this film.  What if Tom Cruise bites the dust in the  new movie?  Now that would be the perfect plot twist. <br />One question  though, who's going to be the leader of the IMF?  Are they going to haul  out Dan Briggs out of retirement?  And if MI2 is as big a bomb as the first  movie, are the people involved going to disavow it?  And is the only reason  a sequel is being made because somebody 'showed the money' to the  principals?
6302250277|5.0|this film really works because the two Women have chemistry.this film has been very influential.i've seen other films take bits from it music videos have used parts as well.Susan Sarandon&amp;Geena Davis are solid.as is the  very Overrated Brad Pitt.this is the only film that he has done worth  seeing.
B00000016Q|4.0|I first picked this LP up back in 81 just after McCartney II came out and Columbia records reissued it on LP. I was not very impressed. I listed to it every now and then and found myself starting to like some of songs that  at first I considered boring.  I just replaced the Columbia LP due to the  demise of my record player with the EMI CD and listened to it for the first  time in years. Wow, what a great record, very personal, raw, and telling of  the current state of mind that Paul was in. Perhaps John and George started  their Post Beatle career with better releases, but any fan of the Beatles  will see the quality of the songs and understand it in the context it  should be taken in. Paul doing it all with some vocal help from Linda,  having fun, and releasing a few songs that to this day hold up as well as  any Beatle tunes.
B000002URV|2.0|i heard all the hype about this disc and i checked it out.it's okay nothing ground breaking.sadness was alright but i didn't get what all the fuss was all about.
0780619951|1.0|This film is unintentionally the funniest thing I have seen ever. As a musician I found the piano playing scenes so disturbing I thought I was going mad when I saw it. The onlt thing worse than Brando's hammy acting is  Kilmer. Watch Thewlis, he knows this is bad and is scared out of his wits.  Avoid like &quot;Venom.&quot;
B000002MFE|1.0|tears in heaven was touching.but the way he did the rest of his material is really wack.he went hardcore mainstream.i've always felt that he was overrated.a good guitar player but by no means on the same page as  Hendrix,Page,B.B. King etc..and that singing is way off key.
B000002MY3|3.0|Not one of the best CDs I've ever owned.  I bought it for the songs of hers on the radio.  However, thoughs were the only songs I liked - I found the others to be fillers.  Even so, there are many good songs on the  album.<br />My favorites are &quot;Hand in my Pocket&quot;, &quot;Head Over  Feet&quot;, and &quot;Ironic&quot;.  Listsening to her lesser known songs,  &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;Mary Jane&quot;, pritty much explains why  they are lesser known.<br />Some people say that Alanis Morrisette is a  &quot;whiny&quot; artist, I'd have to say that I agree, but &quot;Jagged  Little Pill&quot; is still a good CD.
0783227272|1.0|Steven Speielberg is a very talent film-maker but he sinks on this film.i'm wanting Morgan Freeman's character&amp;Dijimon Hounsou charater to have more pressence but not here.they have no voice.but the characters of  Anthony Hopkins&amp;Matthew Mcconaughey have to save the day.typical of  Hollywood.always have to smooth things out when something serious is going  on and the voice that needs to be heard is silent or forced to be Soft.it's  a crying shame.every voice deserves to be heard.
0684803356|5.0|For Whom the Bells Tolls is quite possibly one of the most beautiful books ever written.  After reading Clancy and Grisham for a while, I decided to move on to a classic.  This perfectly quenched my desire.  This is the tale  of an American who fights in the Spanish Civil War.  Love and War are both  perfectly captured in this book.  I have never read such a  &quot;smart&quot; book that looks into one of the character's mind.  I  highly recommend it.
0553573403|5.0|One of the best all time fantasies read.  Don't read as much now (age 34) as I did when I was younger - it takes an exceptional book to capture my attention with all the demands of family, business &amp; life - and this  one did.  Can't wait to read the next (and this is now rare).<br />Excellent  characterization with a breadth of personalities, complex multi-level  imaginative  plot.
B0000021RL|5.0|As an ex-brass musician, I always appreciated Chicago for their blend of jazz, rock and plain old musical skill.<br />In the boxed set, this was considered their &quot;jazz&quot; album.  It is challenging to listen to,  few pop ballads, the 1st half is almost all instrumental.  It is also a  fascinating listen.<br />For non-instrumental songs, three of Chicago's best  are here, Call on Me, Byblos with its wistful lyric, and Happy Man, my  favorite Chicago song (danced to it at my wedding)<br />Over the years, my  tastes have moved more towards jazz, because rock musicians embrace  ignorance.  Chicago VII is evidence to the contrary, that skilled musicians  who care about playing well, can play rock.
630575067X|4.0|Okay..lets get this out of the way right now...this movie did not live up to the hype...I was a *little* disappointed, to say the least....to compare this movie to the originals is a bit unfair, but the movie still didn't  strike me the way I thought it would...whoever put the trailer together for  the movie is a genius, because there's not much more substance to the movie  than was in those 2 minutes....there were too many flaws in the movie, and  I think George is getting away from the elements that made the Original  Trilogy so popular....this one was SO overdone---from the annoying  characters (Jar-Jar, you know I'm talking about you, pal!), to the goofy  underwater seen that was totally out of place, to that ridiculous battle  between the Gungans and the Droids (hello....can you say &quot;Ewok  Battle&quot;?)  The diologue was terrible...the plot was pretty bad (for a  Star Wars movie)...oh yeah, and the kid who played Anakin (who in their  right mind cast him? ) seriously needs to run into oncoming traffic (well,  that was bad...but you get the point)...anyways, for a true Star Wars  flick...this died on impact....HOWEVER, I gave this film 4 stars....because  in itself, it IS a pretty good movie! The special effects are  breath-taking, worth watching for them alone...and it also is good movie to  buy because, although I kinda had a bitter-sweet taste from it...I was  fascinated by it at the same time...it's a movie you can watch over and  over and over and not get &lt;too&gt; tired of....
6305428220|3.0|Not as much 'gloop' as Dusk until Dawn but with the same tongue in cheek style as Scream 2 this film is as enjoyable as it is predicatble. Yes we know that the kids will win in the end (Scooby-do style), yes we know who  the monster is but the story still grips as much as it borrows its ideas  from other movies. We have the walking head from The Thing (albeit this one  is prettier), the band up loser/mixed-up kids from ... er ... all movies  with loser/mixed-up kids in them and the is she/isn't she from ... you know  the movie! This film has style, it does not take itself seriously, has some  bits that will make you jump and other moments that will make you laugh. So  if you find something odd on your local football field, leave it alone! (Oh  and watch out for people standing out in the rain!)
B000001E21|4.0|On the surface, this album sounds subpar: A bunch of old b-sides, one-offs, 10-year old songs that didn't make the cut, and peiced-together arrangements.  Only Def Leppard can turn these ingredients into one of  their best works.<br />  This is the album hard-Leppard fans have been waiting  for since Pyromania; one that rocks the hell out without massive 'A Night  At the Opera'-ish overdubbing.  Songs like Ring of Fire, Fractured Love,  and Action obliterate most of the hits from Hysteria and Adrenalize.  The  ballads are hardly as generic as 'Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad',  either.  <br />  Leppard cleared the decks for this album and did a damn good  job of it.  It's only shortcoming is the inclusion of electric versions of  Miss You in a Heartbeat and Two Steps Behind.  These could've been scrapped  in favor of B-sides from On Through the Night or High n Dry.  As is,  Retroactive will satisfy even people who don't like Leppard.
6304504012|5.0|Madonna did a wonderful job portraying Eva Peron. A lot of people seem to diss Madonna's acting ability (though I've never been able to see why). How can anyone say that she is not a good actress? My God, her whole public  life is performance art! No one could have done this movie as well as she  did; she and the real Eva must have been kindred spirits. I can't wait  until Madonna shows the world that she is still a great actress with the  release of Next Best Thing.
B000002GJ7|4.0|In every era of music, there's those bands that just have talent coming out their orifices, yet somehow slip through the cracks of the mainstream audience.  Extreme is this era's underrated wonder.  Sadly they are  categorized by their two mainstream hits (from this album) 'More than  Words' and 'Hole Hearted'.  While they're both great songs, lord, there's  so much more to this band.<br />  From the power-chord kickoff of Decadent  Dance, the listener knows that their proverbial a**es are about to be  kicked for an hour.  Aside from the occasional ballad, this album rocks out  without a shred of filler.  Cherone finally settles into a comfortable  Freddie Mercury-ish vocal style that suits him and the music perfectly.   Nuno's guitar playing is kicked into high octane from their debut album,  it's more well-timed, restrained, yet way out of the league of 95% of the  musical population.  The rhythm section is at their best on this recording,  as well.<br />  This album's only shortcoming is that it loses it's momentum  towards the end.  Suzi (Wants her all day What?) seems to be a filler song,  and 'When I First Kissed You', while certainly loungey, loose, and  different, won't appeal to everyone.  It picks up again with Nuno's  blistering 'Flight of the Wounded Bumblebee' guitar interlude, and the  final three songs are more masterpeices.  <br />  Pornograffiti is the album  to start with when looking into this sadly overlooked group.  Their best  was yet to come, though.
1559409010|5.0|The greatest satire ever told is now even better. Wow! Dig the exuastive audio commentary!  Great!  Get it. Now.
B000002G0P|4.0|Picture this: A few politically-orientated rockers, a few more soul-searching ballads and pop diddys, an orchestra, one of the most talented guitarists of our time, and the technical cohesivness to blend all  these elements together.  This is III Sides to Every Story, the best work  of a damn good, yet oft-overlooked band Extreme.<br />  Warheads, Color Me  Blind, Peacemaker Die, Rest in Peace.  Full-throttle political rockers such  as these make up the 'Yours' section.   Stop the World, Our Father, God  isn't Dead, Don't Leave me Alone.  These introspective tunes round out the  'Mine' section.   Everything Under The Sun, however, will simply blow your  mind.  A mini-rock opera in itself, this orchestra-backed, half-hour, 3  part opus comprises 'The Truth', the final side of the story.<br />  And there  you have it.  Extreme all but abandons the funk-metal that made  Pornograffiti such a success and instead attacks every other style  possible, sometimes with mixed results but always done with masterful  effort.  Listened to in it's entireity, this album is simply amazing, taken  in bits and peices, it's pretty uneven, as most concept albums are.  The  sound is a nice mix of thrash and pomp, but the production, which sometimes  falls flat (the vocals are tragically undermixed) keeps this album from  being a total masterpeice.  <br />   III Sides is Extreme's best work, but  only listen to it with an open mind.  And do yourself a favor, if you have  the option, get the cassette.  The CD omits one song worth hearing 'Don't  Leave Me Alone'.
B000003Z4C|4.0|Solid, quality Nick Cave. Not a bad place to start if you're not overly familiar with him; it is a good representation of his general style and sound, and contains some real classics (Loverman and Red Right Hand are  essential NC songs.) Not my favorite Nick Cave disc, but a recommendable  one most certainly. Much more polished than earlier discs like From Her to  Eternity and Your Funeral My Trial, more accessible, but still quite dark  and over-the-top, unlike his recent, more mellow work on the Boatman's  Call.
047158651X|5.0|I love this book. it's filled with lots of useful information. I'm a biology student. This book is definitely written with the chemistry student in mind but I found it a useful companion to the Stryer biochemistry book.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|I agree that this is Rage's best album lyrically to date.  However, the music and rythms don't hold a candle to Evil Empire or even the first album (what is that one called anyway? with the monks burning themselves) The  rythms are moody, often mushy and don't seem to flow very well at times.  Still, if Guerilla Radio dosen't make you get up and jump and scream then  there is no cure for you my friend.
0380804557|5.0|The wonderful thing about Neil Gaiman is how he can work in the world of faery without overly softening the sharp edges or glossing over the dark parts. His land beyond the wall is not only the home of flowers made of  crystal and little people, it's the place on the edge of the map where the  monsters dwell.<br />Tristan Thorn is an excellent hero in the classic mode--  belonging neither in one world or the other, he does his best to navigate  through both. Although I have to admit to a certain disappointment that we  didn't see a direct follow-up to Neverwhere, this is a very strong and very  entertaining book.
6305126062|1.0|This movie will insult your intelligence.  My husband and I had to keep pausing it to comment on how ridiculous certain scenes were.  We don't have much time to sit down and watch a movie, so we hate to waste it on  something so silly.  We kept waiting for the story to come back to THE  HORSE (judging by the title of the movie, we thought that was the main  storyline), but it got so sidetracked by stuff that was just too  unbelievable to swallow. I'm so glad that we checked this out at the  library instead of RENTING it at the video store!  I hate paying good money  to watch something that irritates me.
6305263248|2.0|I think it's a nice movie if you like car chase and shooting. I personaly like a nice sorry as well.
0440219078|2.0|The begining was cool and creative, but once Jonas becomes the reciever the book is too slow repetive. And oh yeah, the ending was horrible. Also it is to easy to guess what &quot;release&quot; is.
B0000203Y5|5.0|A beautiful picture - for people who love people and music! I found myself completely transported by this film. Don't miss it.
0805017445|5.0|Brown Bear, Brown Bear by Bill Martin Jr. and illustrated by Eric Carle is a classic book for young readers.  The REPETITIVE (not rhyming) text is what makes the book easy for little ones to memorize.  The book introduces  the very young to animal names and color words.  The simple, REPETITIVE  text encourages even the youngest of readers to chime in.  An excellent  choice and a must have in your child's library.
068484267X|5.0|Last August I bought &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; with the intention of reading it at a later date because I had a library book.  That night I left the library book in the kitchen and was too lazy to retrieve it, so I took  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; off my shelf.  There was no question of leaving  it anywhere because I couldn't put it down.  Even if you don't enjoy  memoirs, don't discout this one!  It reads like a novel.
6304795254|4.0|After watching Seven - I expected to see a less of a Hollywood ending to this one. A well done visually movie with good acting had a bad Happy ending twist that could have been easally avoided.
B00000JL86|3.0|This was a very great animated film, but why wasn't it released in it's original widescreen 2.35:1 format?  It does state right on the disc that it's in widescreen, but it is not.  If it was indeed in widescreen, I would  have rated it four stars.  The only flaw I saw in the film itself is that  the antagonist's character really isn't focused on enough to become truly  fearful.
630157401X|5.0|&quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; is one of my favourite action films of all time. It has action by the bucketful, plenty of suspense and Harrison Ford is on top form. In this adventure Indy goes  out  to retrieve the Holy Grail. On the trail he finds his father (played by  Sean Connery) and finds out the Nazis are looking for the Grail as well....  Last Crusade is definitely better than IC and the Temple of Doom and holds  a candle to the excellent &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Theres also  a bit of comedy as well: Indy kills about 6 soldiers with one bullet on top  of a tank and constantly argues with his dad! I recommend this to anyone  who likes action films.
B00000AFDW|5.0|This CD was a joyful time for me, since it was Kiss's first all-new recording since their reunion. It contains some very good material that I knew Kiss could play. It's in between my other two favorite Kiss albums  (Love Gun and Creatures Of The Night) in its intensity. I do highly  recommend it.
0792110188|5.0|El Dorado is most likely the best John Wayne movie along with The Searchers and Stagecoach. If you are looking for a movie filled with action and adventure, this is it!
B000001EL7|4.0|This album is one of my most favorite earlier Kiss albums. It is a great example of the music that they were playing back then - not quite really rockin' stuff, but still very satisfying. It also contains Ace's first lead  vocal in the form of &quot;Shock Me&quot;. <br />P.S. If you're a Kiss fan,  also consider Creatures Of The Night and Psycho-Circus.
0684843749|5.0|From the seven times Mr. Olympia  Arnold Schwarezenegger the greatest bodybuilder of all time and the ultimate self-made man comes a book that teaches the mind to control the body.  Whether you are a beginner, medium  or even advanced bodybuilder seeing the secrets behind the success of the  world champ make you get pumped and work hard in the gym.  What most people  don't realize is though this book is for steroids-users you can still  adjust the schedules for your own needs as a natural bodybuilder.  Arnold  teaches you how to USE YOUR BRAIN WHEN YOU TRAIN.  I'm a natural  bodybuilder and I follow Arnold's principles and training but this does not  mean that I have to train EXACTLY like him.  For example if Arnold does 25  sets for a triceps workout.  If you don't use steroids you don't have to do  that.  14 sets is more than enough.  Because steroids boost up the energy  by 50% (depends on how intense your workout is) or more you should realize  that if 25 sets are archived by steroids (50% boost up) then half of that  is the maximum that can be achievedd naturally.  That also applies to how  many times you train, how many body parts you train a day, how much protein  intake (steroids uses more protein), and how long you train (most people  spend hours on TV , can't you spend an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes  training?), ....etc.  And the foolish saying that he has the best genetics  that is why it worked for him is wrong.  Because logically Arnold is not  the only gifted bodybuilder with good genetics in the world.  I've seen  many many bodybuilders with great genetics but they don't know how to take  advantage of it.  Look at bodybuilding magazines and you will understand  what I mean.  Every bodybuilder talks about training but it is rare that  someone talks about training the mind (which is the key to start  bodybuilding) like Arnold does to help you achieve your goals in  bodybuilding or in others.  This is doesn't mean that the Encyclopedia  doesn't have very few mistakes but nobody is perfect!   I recommand this  book for everyone in the world of bodybuilding.  It has the principles and  the technical side of it.
6305648522|5.0|I must have watched this movie more than 20 times. I just did, again, with the newly released DVD version. After 11 years since the first release of this master piece, it is still the number 1 film of all times on my list if  I have to rate it; albeit it is unable to be rated by human languages. You  watch and feel it using your heart. Since then my life has been guided by  Alfredo's last words to Toto so much. &quot;Whatever you do in the future,  Love it, just like the way you love the projector booth when you were a  kid.&quot; &quot;I don't want to hear you talk, I want to hea people talk  about you.&quot; The friendship, the love, the memory, .., this movie is  truly a message from God. If you have not seen this movie, I'd say you have  never understood the power of a movie. Check it out, and it'll change your  life.
0783226845|5.0|Ok...think AL Pacino at his best. Multiply it by like 10,000 and you have his acting performance. The scene where he tries to commit suicide still gives me goosebumps.<br />Add to that, great supporting acting, a fantastic  script which is quite funny at times and very moving also and you have  yourself a superb film.<br />Go get it.
B000002IZ4|5.0|This Cd is excellent.Trust me give it a try I still think Tiny Music is better then this though.
B000021XS0|5.0|The most amazing, mind-blowing, gut-wrenching record I have ever listened to!  This album defines the word perfect. In every sense this album is perfect. Since buying it two months ago it has never left the cd player.  Rock on guys!  You dont just make music to bang to but also musig for the  soul.
B0000062FL|5.0|This album, along with the first and third Santana albums, is Carlos at his best. I consider this original line up of Santana's band to be the best. Songs like &quot;Incident at Neshabur&quot; and &quot;Se A Cabo&quot;  burn with a firey Latin intensity. There is GREAT singing and Hammond organ  playing from Gregg Rolie on just about every song. Another highlight is  &quot;Hope You're Feeling Better&quot;, a more &quot;straight-ahead&quot;  rocker-less &quot;Latin-sounding&quot; than most Santana songs. Also, the  live bonus tracks are a real treat. The remastered sound quality is  PRISTINE on the studio tracks- a real treat to hear that great Santana  percussion so crystal-clear. While you listen to this album, marvel over  how each song has such a &quot;live&quot; feel to it, not the sterility of  many studio albums. It almost sounds as if the band is plugged in and  playing live at your house! I can't recommend this highly enough-as well as  Santana I and III. Do yourself a favor and get them ALL!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|As far as trilogies go, none have ever gone to the excessive levels than the Evil Dead series. By combining grotesque horror and comedy Sam Raimi and resident funny man Bruce Campbell brought to the screen cult classics  that never seemed to pale with each sequel. With AOD Sam has taken the much  more humourous side of things and come up with a brilliantly funny film  that sticks it to the medieval aqges whilst holding onto those trademark  stopmotin special effects that we come to know and love. This film is great  if you're in dire need of a good laugh! Watch it, you'll love it!
0792157850|2.0|<br />Jones is back, grosser than ever, but not better than he was in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. Indy's new adventure is to find three rocks and keep his heart inside his chest cavity. Oh, yeah, don't eat too many of the bugs. <br />TEMPLE OF DOOM misses  the mark. It wanders away from what Indiana Jones should be doing, fighting  Nazis and using his brain to piece together ancient puzzles and find buries  treasure.<br />The value here is that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas will learn  what they did wrong for the next Indy adventure.
0385486804|5.0|&quot;Into the Wild&quot; is a beautifully written account of one man's short, but intense life.  Chris McCandless has risen to almost cult-like status as some kind of new-age folk hero for unintentionally orchestrating  the bizarre circumstances surrounding his demise.  After all, if he hadn't  died, it's very unlikely that we'd know anything about him.  Whether or not  he deserves all the attention for his fatal stunt is not the point, as Jon  Krakauer's excellently researched account makes no attempt to portray  McCandless as anything other than what he was: a reckless, vagrant drifter  who's arrogance, immaturity, and lofty ideals, finally killed him.  That's  not to say that he doesn't treat McCandless with an enormous amount of  respect and sympathy -- he does.  He just sticks to the facts, pretty much,  and the results are perfect, just so. The book is very difficult to put  down from the first page -- a real grabber.  It can be easily read in a  day.  Krakauer's investigation into the McCandless mystery left few stones  unturned.  We meet all sorts of colorful folks who knew the young man on  his wanderings over the American west.  All have significant stories to  tell, and through them, for the most part, we learn what kind of man Chris  McCandless was.  We learn much about his ideology; his hopes and dreams,  and unfortunately, his extreme foolhardiness.  By gauging what we learn  about McCandless against what we know about ourselves, a portrait of him  emerges which is startling in its clarity.  The mystery is solved, but the  enigma of Chris McCandless remains.  The book will haunt the reader long  after it's finished.  Krakauer is to be commended for a fine account, very  well told.
B00000255X|5.0|I think that this is the best cd by Bob. I love the song Isis, and Sara. The whole cd is awesome. Bob is the greatest. He has defenitly made his place in music history. I think that he shows us that with this cd.
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn is a magically beautiful tale. I love the way Beagle writes...smooth flowing narration in a calm tone, dotted with poetic and beautiful descriptions throughout. It's just pure fantasy. The ending is a  bit sad though.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|people may think it is not the best cd and don't think it matters well yes it does it does to me this is by far the best and you should go out and buy it now.
0425170349|3.0|I've been an acolyte of Tom Clancy since he was still selling insurance. My uncle, a Navy Sea Systems guy, got me _The Hunt For Red October_ when it was still a hardback you had to get from the Naval Institute Press  directly, OK? But if the badly ghostwritten and error-laden drivel of  _OpCenter_ and his other little &quot;series books&quot; weren't proof that  fame has finally ground the cutting edge off of the poet-laureate of  America's warrior class, he manages to come up with a goofy, convoluted  porker of a book like _Rainbow Six_.<br />OK, a multinational spec-ops unit  would be a nice idea, but he had to put Jack Ryan in the White House to  make it even vaguely plausible. Unfortunately for the bookish Clancy, this  is NOT the sort of warfare that you can get out of _Jane's_ or a couple VIP  tours at Quantico or Fort Bragg, and it just falls flat. You get the  impression this one was done just to pay his alimony (Wanda still around or  no?) or pay off his part of the Baltimore Orioles. Most of the new  characters (can't badmouth Clark or Chavez, I've been through too much with  both...) have all the life of the _Rainbow Six_ computer game and there are  technical goofs and factual errors he would NOT have made when research was  still his religion. This is the only pure-Clancy novel I finished at 0200,  nine hours after I bought it, and asked myself &quot;I stayed up all night  for THIS?&quot;<br />I await his next one, in hopes the once-Master will  redeem himself. Meanwhile, check out Steven Hunter's _Point of Impact_.
6303433766|4.0|Heavenly Creatures is not really the kind of movie you could ever really admit to loving as it's sick consepts barely leave you with any grip on reality - similar to the feeling one gets after such movies as Schindlers  List.  However while Kate was as convincing in her rols as ever, I would  like to see a sequal...  Surely after all these years in the real world the  two friends/lovers would be permitted to reunite!   I am aware that it was  part of their contract but surely it could be reviewed.  I believe Heavenly  creatures was a love story - Romeo killed for his love and we call it the  essence of romance so why don't we consider this the epitimy of love and  friendship?
B00000IPAX|5.0|Enema of the State is probably the best damn Blink-182 album yet!   My favorite songs are Don't Leave Me, The Party Song, and Whats my age again?   If you don't have any Blink-182 recordings then you  should get this one!
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird tells a wonderful and compelling story about the characters.  Beyond the story, however, the true value of the book lies in its moral framework.  Atticus Finch serves as a model for human decency and  dignity in a world that far too often lacks these traits.  By looking for  the inherently good qualities within even the poorest or socially  marginalized of his clients, Atticus Finch personifies the true goal of his  profession, which is to provide each person with equal standing and dignity  before a jury of his peers.
B000009CEM|3.0|If he didn't try to sing in this album, I might give it four stars. But.....we just aren't that lucky now are we? Do us all a favor. scream and growl about social supression all you want....but leave the vocals to  someone with....well.... a voice. Thats all I ask.
B000002UB6|4.0|Now I am not the biggest Beatle fan on the plannet.  I like their music but I like other bands somewhat more.  However the Fab Four NEVER, EVER made a mis-step when they were together.  For a record that was their last  release, the sound is pretty damn raw and honest.  The songs from The Two  Of Us to Get Back are all fairly good although none of them would rank  among my top 20 Beatle Songs of all time.  Catchy yes, worth buying,  absolutely, but this release is a little short of classic status and  certainly not the 99th best record of the Millenium as other voters may  think.

6304698658|5.0|Generations of my family have loved this movie. At Christmastime, my father used to sit down everyone who walked through our door to watch this movie. My brother would always get teary during the scene where Clark is  stuck in the attic watching old home movies. Now I have the DVD copy, my  little 4 year old son has just discovered it and thinks it very funny. The  quality of the DVD picture is spectacular. Although I have seen this movie  too many times to count, I have never seen the picture so clear and  sharp.The wonderful thing about the DVD is that I can never wear out  another copy of this movie!
B00002E233|1.0|The reason why Jaws was a cinimatic masterpeice is the simple fact that there was a powerful suspense to Jaws.But not just that you had to have patience to watch it because Steven  Speilberg made you wait as long as he wanted you to to see the shark.Now here we are a quarter of a century later  some mediocre director want's to try his hand at making his own  Jaws.Instead of a penumatic shark movie magic has replaced it with digital  effects to make well more violent scenes. Yes they still had to make there  own sharks but a lot more relistic with todays advances in robotics and  animatronics.<br />    Our story begins with a woman telling her boss that she  may have a cure to alzhimers , the answer lies in a sharks brain not just  any sharks bio and genetically alterd sharks.<br />        Then we go to a  huge biological labratory it's purpose to genetically breed sharks to get ,  a chemical from the sharks brain to cure alzhimers .Succesufully we see  that the scientist in this<br />movie actually achive it from these 50 foot  man made mosters.This is a great start to a movie that could have been  good.As Deep Blue  Sea sadly turns into a pathetic gore fest the next  hour of the movie is pointless and just trying to get cheap imitation Jaws thrills from the audience. It's a good thing that when people watch  this when they have Dvd because people will want to slow his death down  with slow motion incredible and pathetically fast.Saffron Burrow's and LL  COOL J are the only things that make this movie worth  seeing , they act  suprisingly good for such a poor and down right horrid script and terrible  movie.<br />     The little Hbo docudrama is far more entertaining then the  movie it self and the DVD is impressive.But all in all Renny Harlin should  go back to film school if he thinks his film is a Jaws for the 90's and  learn something from a very good masterpeice director like speilberg.This  film stinks you just get it any better then Jaws.
B0000025D0|5.0|Commercially, Darkness was a disappointment after Born to Run. Listening to the pain on this disc, that's not surprising. These aren't the good-time sing-alongs radio listeners were looking for. All of these songs are in  shadow and like the best of his later material have the sting of dustbowl  folk and urban blues. They're frayed black &amp; white snapshots compared  to the technicolor of much of Born to Run. Here, the rockers (Badlands,  Adam Raised A Cain, Promised Land, Prove It All Night) have a shoulder  hugging urgency that imply that this car might be heading for a wreck. But  the wheels always stay on the road and avoid total despair. With songs like  &quot;Racing in the Streets&quot;, &quot;Something in the Night&quot;, and,  especially &quot;Factory&quot;, Springsteen was sculpting his former  romantic imagery into a raw, minimalist updating of the American ballad  form of Woody Guthrie (a style he'd later perfect on Nebraska). Clumsy  though this disc is at times (Springsteen has always apparently hated its  over-production)- it is for me his seminal album because it shows an artist  fighting commercial whim with an eye on something grander: a musical vision  of the &quot;runaway American Dream&quot; that understood that traveling  all night through darkness is the only way to get to the dawn.
B000009ED0|5.0|I think Kid Rock is the best they have out there.  He knows how to have a good time and how to keep the family values in tact.  He loves his son and I love his music.  I think that is is totally sweet that he wrote  &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot;  for his son.  I actually read a review that  he walked into the room and his son was listening to this song and crying.   I think he is great to his son and his loving and loyal fans.
0790739909|5.0|When me and my boyfriend saw this film for the first time, we were both gob-smacked.  Before seeing it, we assumed that we were in love as deep as is possible - but that was soon proved to be wrong!  This film is for  anyone who has ever been in love, is in love, or has ever wondered what  love is.   I can assure that if you are a compassionate person, it will  take your breath away! Needless to say . . . we are now engaged!  Enjoy,  but remember the hankies!
0385334206|4.0|Vonnegut, justly nicknamed one of the greatest satirists of the time, is truely magnificent in this book. 'Breakfast' proves to be a terrifyingly accurate description of society while at the same time is so obscure and  comical... I enjoyed his style very much, especially towards the end of  this book when Vonnegut introduced himself into the story. Anyone can  benefit from reading this.
B0000035E7|5.0|This album rocks!  The lyrics bring me back to my adolescence, especially Mr. Moustache!  It's what rock started out being, rebellious, angry, a little bit perverse, and sometimes scraping the edge of sanity.  There's  more poetry in this album than much of what has come since, and more than  what most of their peers were doing at the time.  Get it, and give it a  chance.  You'll play it over and over and over and over and over.....
0790729350|3.0|I found the audio/video quality to be pretty good.  Kudos to the engineers.  However, there was si much more to Woodstock that I had hoped to find on this dvd that I cannot offer high marks for content.  Too many  important performances were omitted.  CS&amp;N was abbreviated, Santana was  shorted.....you get the pic.  Too much relatively worhtless documentary  style footage and woefully short on concert footage.  There has to be an  alternative.  Can't some studio put up the cash to get better/more complete  footage of this historic musical event.  The cameras were there - where's  the footage?
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a great album.  I really believe it was the pinnacle of Nirvana's career, capturing the real personality of the band which, among other things, was a combination of raw passion, humour, despondency, and anger.   The moods explored on this album are wide ranging.  The musicianship is  wonderful, especially the drums, which absolutely rock with incredible feel  for the music.  Get it!  And forget that lame comparison below to  Soundgarden.  Nirvana were doing their own thing from the beginning.
6305609721|4.0|STIV remains the most likable and entertaining of the now over 20-year movie franchise.  The characters are to the point now where they are very endearing and Leonard Nimoy really proves himself to be an impressive  director.  Add this one to your DVD collection even if you're not a big  Star Trek fan.  You definitely won't be sorry.
B00000IPAX|3.0|When I first heard blink182, it was the song dammit and I was hooked.  Every song on Dude Ranch was good and I enjoyed listening to it.  When I heard about Enema of the State, I was happy and was excited to get the new  CD.  The song &quot;whats my age again&quot; was good on the radio and i  bought the CD immediatly.  It was pretty good.  But then I heard the song  M&amp;M's from Chesire Cat and my whole view changed.  They are more of a  pop band than punk now.  They all are stuck up.  They even have a link to  be on TRL on their webpage.  This made me VERY angry that such a great band  was trying to be trendy.   But they are still funny, immiture, witty, and  great mucisians and the music on the CD is still good, just not as good as  the older stuff.
079213690X|3.0|This film has its shares of ups and downs.  On the upside, the scenery is gorgeous and the music score by James Horner adds greatly to the emotional feel.  On the downside, Braveheart is too long and too violent.  Do all  period epics nowadays need to show every little graphic detail (severed  heads, arms, legs, etc.)? Performances also ran hot and cold.  Mel is OK  when he's not making noisy speeches, but it is Sophie Morceau who really  steals the film. She's an excellent actress. As far as its Academy Award  victory for Best Picture goes, Apollo 13, Babe, and Sense &amp; Sensibility  were more deserving.  Braveheart is a very big and picturesque movie, but  its brutality and Gibson's smug performance will prevent this from ever  ranking alongside Ben-Hur, Bridge on the River Kwai, and others as a great  epic film.
B000031XCR|5.0|A superior pop collection, and &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot; may be her best single ever
0792156684|3.0|With its magnificent production design and beautiful music score, its hard not to be entertained by this mammothly expensive film.  But isn't 11 Academy Awards and comparisons to Gone with the Wind going a little (no pun  intended) overboard? If you really want to see a powerful and  heart-wrenching movie on DVD about this tragic event, pick up the  British-made A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.  It's much better scripted and directed.
B000021Y74|5.0|The same characters the same setting the same time frame.  One decision by Lola.  Who lives? Who dies? Very Cool Movie.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|This has to be the worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. If there was an option to take away stars, I would give this movie a negative rating.  I am embarassed for all the people that were involved this movie,  including the guy that brought the crew donuts in the morning.  Please  refrain from purchasing this movie. The money saved can be sent to a more  meaningful cause like hiring a lawyer to sue the producer of the movie, for  making us watch this drivel.  You get the idea.
0060977493|3.0|I agree that Roy's use of language is magical, poetic, etc., but I just didn't like the book.  I read the whole book, and while at times I enjoyed the poetry in her writing, I thought the story was dark and disturbing.   And, I can't help but mention this, she included so many discriptions of  bodily secretions that I became nauseated.

0812550757|5.0|How does he do it?   How does he, time after time, produce these ineffable, incomparable novels?  Orson Scott Card has outdone himself with Speaker for the Dead, and puts to shame all other authors who try to hold a  candle to his gargantuan sun.  The world that Ender finds himself in,  completely different from Ender's Game, is the result of the change and  societal development of 3000 years.  Here, the setting is so completely  incongruous and different from Ender's Game's setting that you wonder--is  Ender really in this new setting?  Does he belong there?  But then you  realize that it is 3000 years later, and the conceivable world has changed.   Here, Ender finds himself on Lustania, and meets characters there that  will imprint themselves on the reader's mind so powerfully that they will  never depart.  It was interesting to see Ender grown up, and involved with  the adult world now.  Always, always, as a reader, I was thinking about  Ender's own past, and how this made him function in this new setting.   Here, in this new setting, the plot is so entertaining and complex that you  are simply astounded.  You are immediately hooked!  This is, no doubt, one  of the best science fiction novels that I have ever read, and without  dispute one of the best science fiction novels ever written.
6304342160|5.0|The chemistry between Gina Gershon &amp; Jennifer Tilly is scintillating. This is a not to miss film for viewers who dig strong, sexy women, explicit gay female sex and seedy misadventure. True to life, no one is a &quot;good  guy&quot; in this movie. One major disappointment: abruptly, after the  initial erotically charged scenes between the women, the plot abandonned  the intimate relationship for mafia misadventure for the rest of the movie!  A better choice would have been to continue to combine the two. This shift  left me  very disappointed. Nevertheless, Bound is decidedly one of my  favorites in the Lesbian genre, right behind &quot;When Night Is  Falling&quot;.  I only wish there was a director's cut or at least a  &quot;making of Bound&quot; trailer.
0441172717|5.0|I always knew that Dune was one of the milestones in the genre, the seminal masterwork that influenced many other writers and visionaries.  Herbert's well-known opus has transcended all of my expectations.  Not only  are the settings and extraneous issues impeccably detailed and complex, the  main protagonists go through an exasperating character development.  Paul,  Jessica, Halleck, and Hawat are completely different people by the end of  the book.
B000023VR6|5.0|Out of all the tracks, there's about 4 that are weak. Dre got it all: beats, rhymes, music, everything. With this album, I don't think anybody will be forgetting about Dre. If you think this CD is wack, you must be  crackhead. This is a must buy album. Listen to this before any other album,  you will be more than satisfied.
1558216847|5.0|The story is unforgettable. Made me appreciate even more how much we take for granted. An unexpected benefit, cold weather doesn't bother me anymore. I hope my children will read it.
6304913176|5.0|When I heard what the movie was about, I figured that all it was was another  boring and icky movie that I wouldnt like....Well 1 night I was watching Showtime and the movie was just starting. I watched it.  I  laughed,screamed, and even cryed,you know when Diz died(Dina Meyer). I  couldnt believe how much I loved the movie and that is why I gave it 5  stars.
0451526295|3.0|This is my least favorite of Jane Austen's novels.  I am glad that I read it of course and I would be tempted to pick it up someday again and see if I think differently of it.  It's strange because you never fully connect or  actually like the heroine.  It's the only book I've ever read where I was  hoping the main male character ended up with the heroine's competition!  Likeable book, unlikeable heroine would be my way of summing it up.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I had to have this CD, being a die hard fan of Enigma, but I must say it does not deliver where the last albums have. E1 was a masterpiece, E2 and E3 were beautiful soundscapes, but E4 is missing something. You can easily  hear the techno influence here, but I wish Cretu would stay behind the  console and away from the mic.  The oversampling of O Fortuna was also  dissapointing. Gravity of Love has to be the standout track, a stunning  blend of vocals, synth and drums, but still reminicent of Return to  Innocence from E2. A bit overproduced, but still a must have for true  &quot;Enigmatics&quot;.
0553213342|4.0|Out of all of Austen's heroine's these two sisters were my favorites, particularily Marianne.  I liked this book a lot and swooned as Marianne did over Willoughby!  A wonderful classic and most definitely worth  reading.

B000009EAD|5.0|This CD is a lot like the old Iron Maiden CD's.  The lyrics are very dark and deep, and go perfect with the music.  Something Wicked is a perfect CD for anyone looking for some good metal.
0140434135|4.0|I found this novel Jane Austen's most amusing.  Catherine Morland is her youngest heroine and her innocence and large imagination land her in situations Lizzy Bennett or Anne Elliott would never tread.  It's fun,  clever and witty!  Very enjoyable!
B000009VOL|5.0|I was extremely sceptical to listen to this record.  It was a suggestion from an ex-girfriend, and I really didn't want to like it.  I reluctantly popped a copy of Moon Pix into my car stereo and gave it a shot.  From the  opening 'paul revere' drum loop to the last breath of chan marshall's  voice, i was hooked.  This record is simply one of the most honest and  remarkable independent releases of the nineties.  When I say honest, I mean  it.  There's an authenticity in miss marshall's music that can be found on  very few records of the same musical nature.  Moon Pix is not a stunning  technological breakthrough, nor does it make any profound musical  revelations;  What it does do is allow the listener to be fully absorbed  and entranced by probably one of the most beautiful voices I have ever  heard.  Honesty...let's explore this idea.  Critics could (and do) write  this record off as a girl trying too hard to 'sound' honest.  What I don't  understand is the reasoning these critics use.  Here is a songwriter  pouring her emotions into the public's ears with everything she can give,  and its passed off as 'trying too hard'?  Give me a break.  That's exactly  what makes this record so perfect.  Chan's ability to craft these tunes  with as much emotion as I've ever heard is not just unique in these  musically apocalyptic times, but is so important.  So 'boo-hoo' to you  closed minded music fascists.  Try writing a song with only two chords and  make it as beautiful as a chopin piano concerto.  This album made me second  guess my leaving my ex...  Man it has to be good!
0553213105|5.0|This was the first of Austen's novels that I read and what a great introduction to this famous author!  This book was so charming and funny it was hard to put down and so easy to read!  Elizabeth Bennett is a wonderful  heroine.  Many of the scenes left me laughing outloud!  Mrs. Bennett and  Mr. Collins still bring a grin to my face when I think of their antics!
6302293553|5.0|This film was made with a very low budget,and on only a few weeks.It`s still one of the funniest films ever made,and great entertainment,and as the Pythons humor is timeless,this film still can make people die of  laughter.The only sour note is the ending,so bad and so anticlimactic that  you wanna die.
0553212737|4.0|Emma is a wonderful story.  It's a timeless story and worth reading.  Very light and amusing.
0792842723|3.0|This film has many different components.Some work,some don`t.First:The soundtrack is horrible.Second:Brosnan doesn`t give a perfect performance,but he is great,and has a lot of screen presence.Bean is one of  the better Bond-villains,but the plot is absurd.How did 006 and Ouromov set  up 006 death?That`s never explained.<br />Janssen deserves credit for giving a  great performance,she overplays her role in a wonderful way.
B000002UB3|5.0|It seems pretty stupid praising an album that is already considered one the greatest rock albums of all time, but it is. O.k, maybe a few songs from the first half of the album could be given a miss, but the second half  is absoulutely breathtaking. Don't listen to the 'Stones'fans on here that  dismiss this album, this is a masterpiece, and if songs like 'Maxwell's  Silver Hammer and 'I Want You' are your only reasons for hating it, then  thats a pretty lame excuse. How could anyone possibly give this album one  star when it has long been considered one of the greatest albums of all  time? All I am saying is, if you're new to the Beatles, or would like to  get interested in them, then I would highly recommend it.  Don't listen to  all those goons on here that slag it off.
B000031WD9|5.0|Just as the box-office bomb PCU was an attempt to revisit 'Animal House', the box-office hit American Pie tired to bring an update to the hit 'Porky's.  It far exceeded the laughter quotient for any teen-age comedy  I've ever seen.  With witty writing, superb acting (from Eugene Levy, of  all people), perfect comedic timing, and enough realism to hit home,  American Pie is a must for any collection.  It may strike some as a bit  raunchy and risque, but just tuck that moral outrage in your back pocket  and let loose with a few belly laughs.  Trust me, you'll enjoy yourself  immensely.

B0000399WI|5.0|Stephen King's novels and novellas have a bad rap of not transferring from page to picture with any sense of story or entertainment.  If there was to be a movie to break this 'mold', the Shawshank Redemption is it.  Tim  Robbins animates Andy Dufrense almost exactly as I recall him from King's  story, and Morgan Freeman is as powerful as ever as Red.  The acting and  directing surpassed the writing.  Once I saw this film, I find I prefer it  over the book.  Drama at its finest!
6300214826|5.0|This movie is full of shocking images. You can tell that this movie was made by Francis Ford Coppola. He should have gotten the Oscar for best director. Martin Sheen gave his best performance ever, Robert Duvall was  great, and Marlon Brando was haunting! Be ready for one of the greatest  assults ever filmed! A great film with a great journey into darkness!  Grade:A

B000006GDB|5.0|This film is too often overshadowed by its predecessor, Suspiria.  That's unfortunate because, in many ways, Inferno is the superior of the two.  It unfolds like a nightmare.  We are drawn in to dark recesses where evil  awaits with outstretched arms.  Logic breaks apart as the dream takes hold.   We are left with unfathomable images of an increasingly alarming nature.   Terror knows no bounds and no place is safe.  The final revelation is  thankfully unexplained, leaving the viewer to make up his/her own mind  about what it all means.  This is a macabre jem that deserves to be seen.   Forget the latest dreck that is seeping out of Hollywood.  Inferno is ten  times better!
B000001A3R|5.0|All Kyuss albums are amazing.  This album is increadible.  Every part, the vocals, the bass, the drums, and the guitar are the work of musical genius.  I've heard they're music called a few completely different things, but I'd  say they're heavy rock tuned down a bunch of steps.  That's about it.  This  is one of those albums that is worth buying just for the first song alone.   Buy a bunch of Kyuss stuff starting with this one.
1572522232|4.0|Though admittedly lax in the logic department, this film by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento is still a stylishly ghoulish treat.  The bizarre sets and brilliant, almost lurid, color schemes(utilizing Technicolor's  &quot;Matrix&quot; system)combine to create a strange netherworld of  supernatural menace and imminent doom.  Immensely adding to the viewer's  unease is the booming score by Goblin.  A diabolical concoction consisting  of many different styles, the music acts as the final catalyst in the  audience's free-fall into unimaginable terror.  Intensely savage,  flamboyantly artistic and unforgettably terrifying, Suspiria is definately  a classic splatter film.
B0000399WI|5.0|i had one of the best moment of my life in front of the sceen thanks to this monument of art great acting great story nothing else to say just pure pleasure
0140072187|5.0|Read this when first published.  Having been in the same situations ('68 - '69, 214 CAB), was impressed with the accuracy and realism portrayed.  Now out: &quot;Dustoff: The Memoir of an Army Aviator&quot; by Michael J.  Novosel.  Written in his own hand and as good as Mason's book.
0792839676|3.0|I read the novel and then watch the movie.  I realized that you can not put everything in a movie. Their were many key scene's left out of this movie it doesn't show any of the destruction that was down to the town.   Sue Snell was not at the prom but she was at home according to the book.  The P.E. teacher seem in the book to feel sorry for Carrie the entire movie  unlike was shown in the movie. Carrie mother died in the book by Carrie  stoping her heart.  Also Carrie father died the movie says he ran off with  a woman. Carrie died in front of a bar and was found by Sue Snell.  Known  of the investagation was shown to try explain what happen either. I think  if you just watch the movie with out reading the book you say its a ok  movie. I think they rewrote  the movie because they didn't have enough  money and try to set up some sort of sequel.  Because if you went by the  book their be know sequel.
B00003XB8K|4.0|I agree with a previous reviewer who commented that this latest Enigma project left the listener wanting more. It is the final track Silence Must Be Heard, with vocals by Ruth-Ann from Olive, that reminds me of working  out before going to bed; It leaves you in overdrive with nowhere to go.  Screen Behind the Mirror is definitely miles away from the last Enigma  album ( Le Roi Es Mort, Vive Le Roi ! )which was weak. Screen has more bass  and driving percussion as well as a handful of&quot;up-tempoed&quot; songs  or instrumentals. The reason why some may have found the tracks a bit busy  with sound and samples is because if one listens to the tracks with vocals,  the vocals are faint and sort of blended in with some type of electronic  synth-vocalizer. Also, singer Andru Donalds' voice is somewhat similar to  Michael Cretu's. The vocals are used mainly as part of the instrumentation(  with exception of Gravity of Love and Silence...) and not at the foreground  such as the two previous Enigma albums. Yes, there are samples and familiar  sounds from the first two Enigma c.d.s but no Gregorian chanting (shucks).  Also, for the listener who has heard Ruth Ann Boyle sing before with her  group Olive, it is evident why Cretu chose her for some of the vocals; Her  own group has that slight hip-hop or trip hop feel to it with an edge of  ambience or techno. Ruth Ann's vocals have been compared to as a cross  between Sophie B. Hawkins and Sade; throaty( not in the Stevie Nicks sense)  yet soulful.<br />The #1 complaint is the absence of vocals by Louisa  &quot;This Is the Voice of Enigma&quot; Stanley replaced by another woman  with a less effective and passionate tone. Stanley's was very seductively  soothing and convincing.  The #2 complaint is not allowing or having Sandra  Cretu do any lead vocals (actual singing--not whispering or breathing) on  any one of the tracks as rumored earlier on from other entertainment media  sources. Sandra's vocal abilities have made her a great sensation back in  Europe. For anyone who has not purchased her import c.d.s, they should give  her a try.<br />So, the question is, &quot;Does Enigma/Cretu have a  hit?&quot;--ABSOLUTELY ! However, it remains to be seen if it lives up to  or surpasses Enigma's debut from 1990 . Only the charts and masses will  tell...
B000009QOC|5.0|I love this album! Every song is great and especially Tired of being alive! This album shows that Glenn can sing to any kind of music... punk, rock, metal, pop, you name it! He is absolutely the best singer in the  world! His talent i BIG! Buy this album now! You wont be dissapointed!
6305648522|5.0|Charming movie about how the magic of movies can survive.  It should appeal to any Cinema Historian and lovers of simple beauty:)
630469878X|5.0|Alien made the director Ridley Scott famous, Blade Runner made him the king of adult science fiction. Thelma &amp; Louise made him a bloody genious. No one else didn't want to do this movie expect Scott! They didn't  think there could be enough potential in a story about two women and a  thunderbird. That is really interesting. Ridley Scott took the challenge  and has done a wonderful work. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are both  perfect in their roles. The silent changing of these two characters is done  smootly in the film without underlining. You really start to feel what they  feel as the movie goes on. There is no doubt that they are good guys, even  then when they rob that store and when they blow up that perverts truck.  Harvey Keitel as a honest policeman makes a great role also. Brad Pitt was  annoying at first but what the hell, he IS the character he is playing. I  hate the fact that some people dislike this film because there are women in  the mainroles, and men are left to the background. I think that is just the  power of this movie. Geena&amp;Susan are doing their roles with a good  taste, as well as the whole film.<br />Scott is the master of visuals. Movie  looks very good, every frame is planned. The plot is kinda simple but Scott  makes it work. He is not making  it too emotional or too artistic. It is a  real fine mix of entertainment and serious filmaking. Music plays also an  important role in this film. It is full of positive songs, and Hans Zimmers  original score with slide guitar is stunning. After you have seen  Thelma&amp;Louise you just want to feel that freedom and that road by  yourself. No other roadmovie before this haven't painted the landscapes and  the enthustiasm of driving and getting away so well. This is a dramatic  story about finding yourself and finding that true meaning of frienship  that is eventually all that counts. I'm sorry but I can't think anything  bad about Thelma&amp;Louise. It gets better every time you watch it...that  is a promise!<br />DVD was a good experience, the original widescreen ratio  makes the movie to look suberb. There is also lots of special stuff on the  DVD. For example Scotts commentary track and alternative ending.t...that  is a promise!<br />DVD was a good experience, the original widescreen ratio  makes the movie to look suberb.

0767802519|5.0|Natalie Portman's debut is nothing but outstanding.  Jean Reno is touching; he truly makes you want to root for the &quot;bad&quot; guy.  The action leaves you breathless &amp; waiting for more.  Two people in search  for someone &amp; they find that special person...but, I don't want to give  too much away.  If you've not seen this movie, do so now!  You won't walk  away disappointed.
0156528207|5.0|I just re-read this book (in French). It is not only beautiful. Almost each sentence can be memorized like a proverb. It's like a poem - in prose. It is for kids. And it is for adults. Re-read it - once in a while. And you  will find that the emotions and experiences you've been moved by in your  life will resonate as you reread the pages of this masterpiece.
0395645662|5.0|The Giver was an extremely good book.  Lois Lowry has potrayed the struggle in Jonas's life excellently.  At the same time Lowry adds some parts to smile at, so the story will not be a full drama.  Many parts also  are hair raising and suspenseful.  By far, I would say the Lois Lowry has  written this book very well, with a surprise ending and all.  Although, it  is not fully appropriate for children under 8 or 9.  I would recommend it  to those who are above 8 or 9 years old.  It was the best book I've ever  read, and I  plan to read more of her books.  Once again, The Giver was an  excellent book, with an excellent author.
B000001E7L|5.0|The gang dose it with absolute victory!   Zombie- This is a heart felt POWERFULL song about the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and the &quot;war&quot; in the UK.  Icicle Melts-A song of sadness for those  aborted and the mothers who decide to have this done, how sad it is that  this is done, but Dolores also looks at the mothers pain.  Truly a  wonderful collection of music.  I can go on and on and on.  But I'd just  rather get this over with and listen to it instead.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I bought the CD, 'Supernatural' by Santana, &amp; listen to it in the car, in the house, &amp; every where. My friend said you can't dance to it - - it's for listening only. I told her that it's definitely for dancing. The  first song is for merenge, 2. for Rumba, 3. for Rumba, 4. Samba, 5, Cha Cha  Cha, 6. Rumba, 7. Samba, 8. Cha Cha Cha, 9. Cha Cha Cha, 10. Salsa, 11.

0767819594|5.0|it's been a long time since i've seen a movie like this one. i absolutely love the plot and the actors. the only thing i'm upset about is that Sebastian was killed. i really liked him.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|this album overall is a solid album. there aren't any bad songs, but there aren't any awesome songs like killing in the name or freedom like on the debut self titled album. still this cd is definentely worth buying.if you  haven't bought any rage cd's though, first get the self titled album, then  get this and then get evil empire
B000000OAN|5.0|Next to News of the World, I'd say this is the best album.  With songes like Bohemian Rhapsody and The Prophet's Song, this album is a true work of art.
1573226521|5.0|Well, my friend Elliot recommended this book to me and, being the movie man I am, I read it.  It is the best book Ive read to date.  I could see the what the characters looked like, what they were seeing, and feel how much weed they were smoking (j/k).  I finished the book in two days.  All  of my homework and other responsibilities were put on hold while this book  became my priority.  I read so fast that I cant fully recall some of the  content of the story.  I do recall Jed though.  Jed was my favorite  character, and I think the most provocative.  This review probably wont  help you understand the story too much, but it should get you to buy the  book.
B000002BSV|5.0|Suede know how to write a great albulm. And this is one
0060900075|5.0|This book has shown me a way to place all my feelings and thoughts into a manifestation of intelligence that I can share with others. This book has also shown me a way to express feelings in word form, and has helped me to  complete my own  book, which is soon to be published.<br />For those who gave  it low ratings: I would have to say you were too young, or too stupid  (harsh but true) to get anything out of this book. Anyone who can't  comprehend it can't get anything positive from it.
0800177975|5.0|The big mistake is that too many people didn't understand the spirit of this fantastic, ingenious, bigger-than-life movie!<br />They didn't get it at all, and they took it in the first degree, instead of seeing it as what it  really is: a big joke about action movies! Too bad for them, they missed a  lot of fun...
B000002HPV|5.0|Ok i sound like a crackface, but seriously, Bjork is great, and this is equaly as amazing as Post, even a bit more amazing.
