B00EUUNJRM|5|Day light. Love it.
B008J5H6I2|3|Cut out some of the sound, but I was  hoping for a little more
B00OU5LOT2|5|I can't say enough about these guys. I set this up and was immediately wowed at the look my car has. The lights are amazing. Then my controller went out, I sent an email and just like that a new controller and control. Amazing company!
B00LU5FP7W|5|Great - actually can fold in half (pivots on each eye piece.<br /><br />Use for motorcycle.....Comfortable - would recommend
B00PGBUC10|5|Looks awesome. Holds up to my constant washing of the car too!
B00ODSAMG2|5|Replaced all of the recessed halogens my motor home came with, love these!
B00SHF5Z64|3|Only 3 stars at the moment, as I have not installed this item yet. I'll provide an updated review once I've installed it.
B00P64H6LG|3|ok
B004TB3TXQ|5|Quality filter and easy to install
B000FGCYT4|5|LIFE TIME AIR CLEANER , JUST REMOVE AND CLEAN ! VERY SATISFIED !
B00062ZDAE|5|Works as advertised
B000V2SVFS|5|perfect fit
B001MXTOKQ|5|Works great on motorcycle wheels.
B0091FJYES|5|Works great
B0022ZUS4O|4|just what I needed. Perfect
B001O0GDG0|3|Wheel is great ! But do not expect to communicate with Grant products. Have tried e-mailing, snail mailing and faxing to get a return shipper for my core wheel ( which they claim they will pay $40 for ) they will not respond.&#62;&#62; UPDATE &#60;&#60;  My e-mail was returned with this message&#34; WE DO NOT ACCEPT CORE RETURNS FROM AMAZON OR E-BAY &#34;. WT.....  Bottom line, be happy with what you pay for the wheel as they will not accept your core return. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !
B00LNDKXF0|5|Item arrived as described. Matches the original as I had hoped. Nice!
B00A82A2ZS|5|good battery
B00042K74I|2|Will not work with a toolbox mounted
B00COYNVME|5|Looks great.  Can't wait till Christmas to see if Dad likes it too!
B0077S1BBU|5|excellent product
B002PUWY1Q|3|While the mat it's self appears to be of good quality, it was not better communicated in the description that this was only ONE mat, not a set. It's a tad disappointing especially since most people that are going to order floor mats need a set not just an individual mat.
B009ADABAM|5|Will be buying again!
B00IZCNN72|5|Perfect for extending the propane line between my travel trailer and BBQ on a picnic table.  High quality cable and connections.
B005ASZKEI|5|Good !
B004M06BRA|5|Got these for a 16 year old birthday gift.  How can you go wrong with fuzzy dice??  He absolutely loved the dice and they are currently hanging up in his truck.  They are of good quality and the size was perfect! I'll definitely be buying a lot more fuzzy dice for other friends kids for their 16th birthday!  Update:  Got these for another 16 year old birthday gift and he loved them just as much as the first kid :) :)
B000IZ02Z0|1|I am really disappoint with this product. This breaks well but it doesn't last I got mine less than 3 months ago and now I will have to replace them  and that's is really weird since I only use original part in my truck  The ones I got from the dealer they last 1 year and this ones just 3 months  I don't know if AC Delco has 2 different qualities definillly won't buy this again  ps I gave 1 star because you can't put not star. That's what this product deserve from my experience
B003CSNCUC|5|Works great, easily installed per the supplied instructions
B00XM43M1U|5|Fitted perfect and looks sharp.
B006DX18RC|3|Just to let everyone know this does not fit a 2010 Dodge Ram 1500 St 3.7L.  I went to Dodge Dealership and looked it up. The other parts company's say this will fit. Dodge only lists the ( Mopar 56029049AA Oxygen Sensor )  For this truck. The difference is the size of the engine which is for the 4 and 5 liter engines and then also this one is six inches longer.
B001E2SSRA|5|Its a little large for my windshield but this is exactly what I wanted. Very good protection against scratches.
B00T0TYXGY|5|Supernatural fangirl, and darn proud of it! My husband just shook his head when I told him to put this on the family minivan :p
B000WJ9VNG|5|very good price japanese chain , very durable  is not stretched so fast and while keep, it clean and oiled it makes little noise really recommend it
B000IDYKQO|5|Extremely easy to use and durable.
B00NBT4774|5|very cute, love it
B003S6F3IC|5|Couldn't ask for anything more.
B000CGMQB8|5|Fits like a glove.
B007J7G07E|5|Really bright
B008AVAE7A|4|Directions a little difficult but cheaper than local vendor
B00PL4HRA6|3|As sent, these do not fit 2011 Toyota FJ. Had to call to get another seat cover sent to fit with arm rest. Cover quality is nice enough but bottom seat cover fits sloppy. Impossible to tighten. Going to tsk off and sew on my own strap that sill snug up side to side. I won't buy these again, but by time I modify, they will be ok
B00IN5X2P4|5|The best cargo liner Toyota offers.  Attaches to &#34;carpet&#34; with velcro and splits with the third row seats.
B00B9FDCDW|5|Beautiful replacement piece.
B001JT3DYQ|4|I use this for my cb, loud enough to hear the radio well with all windows down. Easey to mount, comes with all you need, eould definitely recommend.
B008XB9BJY|5|These LEDs are a warm color that is perfect for the light we are used to in the RV.  You can't even tell the difference between them and the stock incandescent bulbs except they are a little brighter and cooler. So far we have swapped out five and eventually we will do them all.
B00BCRMB34|5|True to size
B000CQFS0O|5|They are great will buy again
B0078UBKO0|5|It's safe to say that anything you buy from Yukon will be of the highest quality and come in a complete set nicely packaged. They have never let me down and I have purchased many many sets from them. A++
B000FJQWYO|5|nice gauges. too bad they quit making them...
B007S0GQ3A|5|Just take this!!!
B000F5DQWY|5|Loudest horn I have heard!!!!  Small but powerful.  Easy to install.  Can't go wrong with this product!!
B00W3AI7KA|5|I thought these roof rack bars weren't going to fit my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited at first, but after much manipulating of the adjustment screws and figuring out which one is supposed to be in front and which is the rear one, I finally got them mounted. Oddly enough the stickers which come with the rack that state which one is the front and which is the rear are not affixed to the roof rack so you'll have to figure it out by trial and error!  The wrench they supply is a pain in the butt (it's so slippery I dropped it dozens of times) -- I think another reviewer mentioned something about getting a Torx bit for a socket wrench and I'd have to agree.
B00GHSKXM4|1|Do not buy! They suck there in the bumper loose and the lights don't fit in the socket
B00D0BNL5C|5|Amazing product. Looks very authentic and factory-fitted.
B00LWBB6N6|5|Perfect size and conditions
B00K8BLM7G|5|The product looks great.  Instructions were easy to follow.
B0013TNMY8|5|Great quality product! Injection light went off and car is running great!
B000C7VYLU|5|Properly fitted
B000IYSJLK|5|All good 2000 f350 fit good no problem<br />Very easy to install
B0082365AQ|4|Great cart and a fabulous price.  I'd give it 5 Stars if the tires were not so stinky.  Fortunately I am able to leave these outside the house until the smell goes away.
B00KCQSOAA|4|Great fit n looks fabulous makes sitting n riding much comfortable.
B00AXE635O|1|Product was packaged in a very tight roll that wrinkled several inches on one end.  I might try it on an old car but not the quality I want for a new car.  There were no instruction for installation.
B000EDOSS8|5|Good product. They do require you to remove your old ones from your camper.
B005OZNRVK|4|muy buena
B000BZEIVQ|5|Excellent.
B00310TBI8|2|Unfortunately, I did not like these sunglasses.  Although they are listed as &#34;oversized&#34; they were much too tight for my Large head.  Also, the pictures don't accurately show the shape of the frame; the top frame goes up from the center outwards bilaterally giving the glasses an odd shape.  Not what I expected from the pictures.  What I did like was the matte finish and the extra lenses.  I will be looking at Bobster's other styles.
B0030V6XW0|5|Flitz PW took all the water spots off from our Brushed Nickel finished sink faucet.  The water spots were really bad, but once I applied the stuff and let it sit it worked.  Had to reapply a second time to remove the few stubborn spots.  The amount required to use is very minimal so I expect the bottle to last a long time.  The best part is it is safe to use and you don't have to worry about poisonous chemicals.  I would have liked to have seen a bigger bottle, but it works.  I will definitely reorder this product again!
B00Z2R1OJM|5|This is perfect for my husbands bits. Magnet is very powerful
B0041P5T24|5|Instructions a little hard to understand. Huge performance improvement. Would definitely recommend for your Sportster.
B00L2QM806|2|Very disappointed,  Screen itself is fine, but the suction cups for attachment are a totally different matter.  Because they are so small, suction area is limited, and the slot into which the screen fits is too small and doesn't hold the screen.  Will use my own suction cups with clips.
B000CN50K0|5|Cheaper than jegs and summit and worked perfectly on my build couldn't be happier
B00820NN86|5|Works great with my Mityvac 7400 pump.  Super easy to use and makes brake bleeding very quick.
B0032YA4PW|5|item as described
B00A3NJ6QS|5|Really delighted with this, been stuffing towels into headrest of car for a while, after hirse riding & gym workouts.<br />This stays in position, without amy plastic/rubber buds(didnt want to take chance of anything melting in the tx heat).<br />Nice and big, not much shape to it , basically s big soft towel with pocket that hooks over headrest. Does the job, bought pink as less expensive, pretty color but don't think it will remain
B00YE5Q132|4|The DBPOWER 12000 mAh portable battery-starter is a very handy multi-functional product to have in your car.  One of the biggest benefits of this product is that it mixes functionality (battery bank, jump starter, LED light, red LED hazard flasher) with associated cables and packages it together with a very sturdy carrying case.  I feel comfortable putting this in my trunk and not worrying about it getting crunched by heavy things I may throw into the trunk from time to time.  This product provides a distinct sense of comfort knowing I have this product for device battery angst issues, jumping my or other cars, and/or roadside hazards at night.  First and foremost this is a 12,000 mAh battery bank.  DBPOWER provides a USB cable as well as a series of adapters to charge common laptops and other AC charger devices.  This product works with no issue with my Apple products (needed a cable) and I used an adapter to charge my HP laptop.  Going from a zero charge on the laptop, the power bank was able to charge it to 30% before exhausting itself.  The LED flashlight and red flashing LED hazard lights are accessed by either pressing the power button for a long time (LED flashlight) or by pressing the power button twice quickly (red LED flashing hazard light).  The LED flashlight is ok, not overly bright but useful if you need it.  I prefer to keep a [[ASIN:B008HU8P52 headlamp]] in my trunk for a 'flashlight'.  I very much love the flashing red LED hazard light.  Having to pull over the car in the dark is truly perilous , anything to improve the ability of oncoming cars to see me is a bonus in my book.  Jump starter.  I was not able to test this functionality at the time of this review.  Although it does provide a sense of comfort knowing I have the potential to jump my own car as needed.  One thing I am not clear on and will pay attention to is how long the battery will hold the charge.  Do I need to bring it in weekly/monthly/semi-annually to charge.  Is this different inwinter versus summer?  Cons: - The instructions for the jump starting need to be more explicit and detailed.  While it may seem common sense, they don't tell you when to turn the device on before or after connecting to the battery (my judgement, after).  Jump starting a car is not the place to have fuzzy information. - A bit pricey if primarily using as battery bank.  Not sure what the final price will be on this item, when I reviewed it the price was around $80.  Suggestions: - Spend a lot more time on simple diagram instructions for the jump starting. - Add magnets to the product so that when using the flashing red LEDs for car hazard situation, the unit can be mounted to different locations on a car and won't fall off.  Sample was provided for review.
B000CAINRK|4|Pds my shoulder to protect my Pacemaker.
B000182DOM|4|fit perfectly
B00STSY3RQ|5|great product..nice quality
B0009IQXM2|5|works well
B00JFDIV4A|5|OEM look, fit, feel, and quality.
B000AMLWH8|5|works fine
B00UCAQR6O|4|These mirrors look fine. I recommend it.
B00O4J2WZY|5|First let me state that this is the exact replacement for the shade that is in our 2012 Winnebago View.  For that I am pleased, and it installed without a hitch and works perfectly.  That said, the reason I bought this one was that the first one that came with my RV died a quick and unfortunate death due to what I consider to be a weak design.  To make the new one last much long you must not let the shade retract on its own without holding on to it to allow it to fully retract to the up position slowly.  In our case it slipped out of my hands as I released it and the fast retracting of the shade ruined the entire mechanism.  I will be much more careful with this replacement, as they are pricey.
B00VHZMNKM|4|This is my second set
B00I96JZU8|4|The battery I received actually had a problem.  That happens sometimes.  I was able to return without any problems as stated in the documentation.  Thanks.  I would have got a replacement but needed something right away.
B00SE3ZOUQ|3|thank you
B00MQCXC2S|3|These are painted chrome over plastic, and is NOT real metal chrome. However, barring that. For plastic chrome emblems they are of great quality. The stick tape on the back is good quality and will keep the emblem stuck to the vehicle, but once placed, it CAN NOT be moved. Which is a GOOD thing, because if you could, it would mean it would easily fall off. So these will stay. Again great quality for plastic chrome. How long the plastic chrome will look good is another story. I will update if this changes.
B006N94OYK|1|The part is as pictured  but the description is wrong. It does not fit a 2000 s10 2wd.  Not worth returning  because of the price.
B0068N1B0Q|4|It appeared to be well made.  I was hoping for an exact match with the OEM filter but it wasn't.  There were more pleats out of a thinner material than the OEM filter.  For the premium price I doubt I will purchase again.
B00802G20C|4|Great price!
B000BUTDCA|5|hi grade stuff
B00B7SHEMQ|1|i buy this light but i recieved damage<br />one side class is damage and when i installed i see there are 30 space for led but they install only 22 led<br />all the last row are embty and no led were found!!
B00F2PNJII|5|Love it!
B00MMTLL1E|5|This is such an easy replacement part.
B00KTJ7IGQ|4|Works just fine.
B00M0G5GPG|5|exactly what I needed, fraction of local price and quick delivery
B0024NWR0M|4|Overall replacing the headlight assemblies was relatively easy. One the right side assembly the hole for the headlight bulb was not cut correctly and took extra work to get the bulb to fit.
B002GO93I8|4|Burly and well made...However: Be aware of a fitment issue in Jeep Wranglers (I have an 06 LJ): I installed this hitch and a Banks Monster exhaust at the same time.  The new exhaust had to be trimmed at the tail-pipe to bring it behind the flange on the right side of the hitch.  Had the stock exhaust been left on the Jeep, It, too would have had to been trimmed, and a new tip installed. If your Wrangler has a rear-exit exhaust (some had side exit) be aware that you may need to mod the tailpipe.
B006DDHZ1K|5|as promised
B0002UQA8E|5|Works great not oily and look great
B000VYRB8E|5|This is the second set I have purchased and I have no complaints about them at all
B00Q4YQBGI|5|I love this mitt for washing my car! It is comfortable to wear and gets the job done. It also doesn't get gross like the typical sponges do.
B009TKYVGQ|5|as described, no issues
B00LIAOUU2|1|When I received the kit, one of the ballast did not work. Tried everything and nothing. The next day I tried again hoping for better results but nothing at all works! Emailed the company and got no replies at all.
B001IWFCAM|5|Just like OEM for my 07 BMW E90 335xi.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Perfect match easy installation
B00RG404OA|5|Awesome !!!
B007XZJZOW|4|Looks great. Big improvement!
B000630D9Y|5|Best air filters ever.
B000C8RASK|5|Perfect fit in my 2002 Suburban. They seem to work good.
B002R0YNDQ|5|Arrived in perfect condition - easy install in minutes.  Works fine.  looks just like the original.  Nothing to it.
B00RE9UNSY|1|does not work with a h11 plug. find something else.
B00HQZ92UQ|2|didn't really see any noticeable difference over my 4 yr old factory wipers.  smeared in all the same places on the window.
B00PJBN67E|5|Perfect!
B001KO7350|5|Got these two days after I ordered them. Took only an hour to install.  A little on the louder side but its much better than the stock.
B00KTIE7CA|1|Could not use. Ordered the wrong remote.
B003NU9O0G|5|great quality & price
B00LML7GJY|5|In a space just a bit larger than a conventional battery pack, the Wagan adds reasonable solar charging features so that you never feel like you're out of juice.<br /><br />It's rugged and seems like it will stand up to lots of use. The solar panels seem well integrated and like they will hold up to outdoor use. I like that it comes with Apple-style (30-pin) and USB connectors, meaning that you can use it with a wide range of devices and not need to go hunting for an extra cable.<br /><br />In terms of capacity, a single charge seems to be enough to take my Apple iPhone 6 Plus from single-digits to about 85% charged. It also charges about as fast as a plug-in charger. An 85% charge on my iPhone 6P will generally last me at least 3 or 4 days of mild use, so the Wagan can be used to keep me on the air indefinitely.<br /><br />About the only drawback is that with only a relatively small solar cell, it seems to take quite a long time to fully charge. The instructions say 18 hours, but of course it depends on the intensity of daylight you get. In my day to day use, I'd say you get about a 35-40% charge per day of sunlight (that's summertime in NY).
B00MV6E8R2|5|I like it
B007TS1E74|2|Died shortly after I bought it (about 2 months).
B00CHD4UQ8|5|Fits as expected. Easy to install.
B00MDG14CC|2|I had some 27 watt 4 inch lights in my bumper before these and i cant tell any difference between the two. These are supposed to be spot pattern but seem to be flood like my old ones. The light these put out has a strong purple tint to which probably makes them look dimmer than they really are. The biggest negative is that they go off randomly, I'm guessing they are over heating. I never had this problem with the other lights. And also of note is that they do not shine any further than my factory high beams. All in all I wish I would not have bought these. They are installed on a 2005 Nissan titan with a custom front bumper.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Installed on a 2015 Chevrolet Silverado, no issues at all!! No error messages, and lights are BRIGHT and white!! I have used multiple HID kits in other vehicles and these are brighter than any HID kit that i've used. No warming up either, instant on!!
B00UK40SSU|5|Good
B001TK7CYM|5|I love these for everything safety goggles related. They work great and look far better than anything else I've seen. My only concern is that they fog up unless you're riding a bike or motorcycle but a little defogger can take care of this
B00GZLMEPM|5|This works as advertised...... Best one ive have ever used. If you FOLLOW the instructions as the suggest you wont find a better product once I did my headlights on my 2002 mini van all my friends and family what me to do the same to thiers..... BEST ONE YET........!
B00KQ15JZ4|5|I works.
B0022ZL6FE|1|This part do not fit the gl1800 2005 gas tank
B00OBY36KW|4|Good alternative to a traditional helmet lock. Allows you to lock up other things like a jacket, luggage or multiple helmets.
B000CNN26E|4|Decent sound. I had a good muffler prior but glad I replaced it. This is an inexpensive option with good clean sound. I already had one so volume/beef wasn't much different, but overall cleanliness to the throaty sound was def noticeable.
B0002YR8H2|5|This is a great Charger at a great price. My family has been in the battery business for 39 years. The cables are a nice 6 gauge WELDING cable, which if you know anything about cables, welding cable carries more current than standard automotive cable. It is also VERY flexible. You can tie this stuff in a knot! That does not mean they are cheap flimsy cables!!! The wheels and handle are pretty flimsy, and the clamps are not heavy duty. You do not need heavy duty clamps on this type of charger. If you are melting cables or clamps, you are not hooking it up correctly, leaving it on too high of a setting for too long, or you have a shorted out battery.<br /><br />In the end, this is a great charger, priced extremely well for all the settings that you get. (Automatic chargers of this size are mostly all hype. They tend to shut off too early, or never even start to charge a stone dead battery. This manual and/or timed charger will do the trick)
B007GIYPB4|5|Item was packaged well and arrived quickly. Install was a breeze and fit was excellent for my crew cab Titan. I drove it on the freeway right after install and it was great! Only downside was it was missing the LED light that was promised as a free gift along with other goodies. I didn't really mind since the product itself surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />update 9/12/16:<br />so far it's still holding up well. the little caps on the bars that keep it sturdy when laid out came loose, but nothing superglue can't fix.  the stitches on the velcro on one corner have come off/ripped off (about an inch).  it still seem to hold fine though.
B009M5A892|5|Exactly as listed, good quality part!
B000BPLNXC|5|Great size, very sturdy.
B001GRMJBE|5|item as described
B000XYVIZO|4|I like this product. It is sturdy and fits well with my Chevy S10 and when folded up thier size makes for easy storage in bed of truck. My only complaint is not with the product but the way it was shipped.  No extra protection was provided to prevent damage during shipment. It was shipped in orginal mfg box which is not strong enough to handle the rigors of the UPS shipping system. MY box arrived damaged and torn open in places. The ramps why not damaged were scratched up and some of assemply hardware was missing. I had to purchase some bolts, nuts, and washers from home depot to finish assembly of ramps.
B0097RDS6K|5|Easy to use. Started bike right up.
B000C2E6A6|5|Did not fit 2003 Tacoma V6
B00I7ELHL2|5|Worked perfect on my 2013 Chevy Cruz and arrive quicker than expected. It even came with installation instructions.
B00QPV8B22|5|These snow brushes are lightweight & portable brushes for car, outdoor clothes & shoes etc.  They have a thin row of bristles that will make it easier to keep them from getting clogged up. Having a thin row of bristles also allows you to get into narrow spaces and right up to the edge of your windshields,  These come with a very comfortable handle made from foam.  It allows for a better grip and more control while using. I love that these are more useful than just for snow.  I used mine to help clean my shutters and the outside of my window sils. This brush can get into splaces that others can't.  It hasn't snowed here yet but I am sure these brushes will do a great job. A great bonus was the 2 microfiber cloths that came with these!<br /> I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased  review.
B00YI2WSSI|5|I had a small problem with a connector bein. Flipped seller responded to email quickly solved problem , love the lights I have a spray tint on the outside , I couldn't see with my stock bulbs, these light up the whole road through the spray tint 110% happy
B008564ZQG|5|Awesome!
B0082OU772|5|As described arrived on time..
B0000AZ834|5|Perfect fit for a trawler trunk cabin.
B008HZOSTO|4|Good
B0031OQN0S|5|Fit perfectly
B00CM589B8|5|great
B000CNBBQC|5|Fast easy install,,,,,had tape stick on type and one of them fell off.......ps:  Best way to get the glue off the paint from stick on type is with terry cloth damp with gasoline.
B00D9BFR8M|4|This is a great cover for my motorcycle.  It fits perfect on my HD Dyna Street Bob.  It prtotects my vehicle from sun and rain.  However,  if the rain is heavy then it will leak some  rain water but overall this is a great cover.
B000VDYQXS|2|blah
B0085C9222|3|Great fit and very comfortable. Easy to get on and off. I go through these gloves way too fast though because the fingers always rip. This is probably my 5th pair in the last year.
B00GYCDZF0|5|Works great.. Definitely worth the money
B00TZ5Y67O|5|great lights
B00OWS4N1S|5|The &#34;best&#34; cover for the money. Great quality and easy install.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Mounted these on my john boat for night bowfishing and they are awesome.  Super bright and can spot bottom in over 5 feet of muddy river bottom. May even buy more, def. best bang for your buck!
B001FOLMR0|3|purchased this product because of past product experience. this is expensive, does not hide heavy scratches even with crayon (gimmick). what it does do is hide very minor surface scratches and it does leave a deep deep shine and if you follow it up with a sealer it will last for a while.
B00ENNQERS|4|These bulbs work fine. The color is slightly mis-matched, but close enough for a bargain bulb. They fit my car perfectly, so you can trust the Amazon sizing.  On my car, this kind of bulb is not simple to install. Just look on YouTube for instructions for your car. It really helps to watch a video.
B007MNU4WC|5|So happy, it worked the first try at setting it and it arrived right when it said it was going to
B0055PD1H4|5|Really restores the trim and looks like new
B00229IMDY|5|I would highly advise these over the standard suction cup version of the &#34;baby on board&#34; signs. I placed these on both sides of the back bumper and immediately noticed I was not being tailgated by drivers. These are bright and attention drawing, thus more people are reading them and being more considerate when following. Another plus is that are still on after car washes and snow storms!
B00ZKDGCVS|5|I love this sticker!! It came a 4 days early!
B00KTQ8W46|5|great fit and looks good in black!
B000QV2ENO|5|Fits our 2005 Ford Escape Hybrid perfectly.
B00842A7F4|5|Perfect! These little bastards break and leave panels flopping in most vehicles. Nice to have on hand when your daughter's car is falling apart!
B008HYP09M|4|tire fit fine...I just wish they made tire with more rubber on them...
B00PXUXF8G|1|Not glass plastic. Returns are VERY expensive
B002F5ZCP6|1|Decal was obviously made with cheap vinyl. I would recommend having a local business make this product for you. This product is a POS!!
B000BRFSU4|3|over priced
B0009JB7GI|4|Does the job, just wish it came with a stronger adhesive to attach it!
B00NID51JQ|5|Perfect
B005NLQAHS|5|Works exactly as described!  If you have a small space under your dash, and want to leave this in place, be aware, it is large, and may get knocked out.
B004TRKBOK|5|Good quality
B00CGGXQV6|5|Excellent product. Live in AZ and its great would highly recommend this product
B01093Q9BQ|5|These are wonderful. They give a lot of support and are small enough that I move mine from car to car.  We use them at home, work and in the cars. My kids even use them while doing their homework. Great product.
B00Y75QZFI|5|[[VIDEOID:a70ae74586cd89ab8968567fe772273a]] I have a Ionizer in my home office..I like having it in there because of all of my PC stuff. Keeps the air clean and the dust down in the room. I do smoke and I know its a nasty habit. While I do not smoke in my truck when my son is in there he does complain about the smell. Cig smoke gets into everything and on anything... So I thought why not...Lets try this. After 4 days I noticed a huge difference in the smell of my tahoe and so did my boy. He was Happy! Its a large vehicle and it took a few days but I don't think my wife's ca,r being a compact, would take more than a day. You just plug it in and forget it. It does all the work..you just enjoy the clean smell of your car.<br /><br />The dual smart charger is also very nice. In case you only have one aux port in your car this has one that you can put the ionizer in it and still have 2 ports for charging your smart devices. It being a smart charger it will supply whatever your device needs to charge. You dont have to worry about it over charging. It can produce up to 2,4a so it can fast charge your tablets too. Whatever your device needs up to 2.4a will get a proper charge.<br /><br />This kit comes packed very well and would make a great gift idea. Both pieces are very nice and built well. For the price this is an amazing little product. I highly recommend it and I am giving it a very high 5 star review.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.
B00MBQ08J4|4|They are cute but curl at the tips. Not horribly but they do.
B007SKAKPU|5|Can't beat it for the price.
B0030D0SME|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00HX9LK3M|5|excellent
B0010DZZQ0|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B0009JKI8G|1|Wrong part
B00BZOBDCE|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B000GZPH2U|5|love it simple and practical
B004K23KQ0|5|This thing is a beast (much heavier than I expected). It does fit a little loose so I suggest you wrap some tape around it and/or shim it.
B00AX64HGE|5|All Griot's products are the best !
B0051NOKZW|5|Like the other reviews state it comes ready to go and I had it installed in just a few minutes. While researching this product I found other products with reviews that stated that the covers did not conform with the top of the bed and left some overhang on the tailgate end. This cover conforms to the bed evenly on all sides for a great fit.
B00OM4VO1O|5|High quality thick materials. Looks good in my Tan interior. It is a dark brown but the material and patern looks great. Doesnt show stains like the factory covers. Not as good as completely replacing the covers but way better than most all other covers ive seen.
B008BLKI2U|3|It's not glossy as I expected
B008ADNRQI|1|The tube was rotten. When the shop put air to it it slip at the seam
B00UPRWI5I|5|Did not have the space plate so I used 3 washers. There were some scratches on the brackets and some tiny ones on the chrome itself. Otherwise a very good product. I am very pleased.
B002X9VVPO|5|Love it
B00Q8FU5E2|4|4/5 for missing screws and instructions<br /><br />This is much higher quality than expected. Installation wasn't bad and no real problems arised. Throatier sound, tad better throttle response, and it looks good to boot. Can always replace the filter with a name brand for possible better results as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this for anyone wanting an aftermarket intake at a fraction of the cost of Spectre, K&N, Etc. Doubt you'll see a $200~ difference.
B002YCFQBU|5|Awesome. Fit perfect and looks excellent.
B004DDHXCI|5|Fast delivery!  The part was exactly what we needed to fix the problem.
B00IMO60T6|5|performing well so far...
B00589RHV8|5|Took me a while to get it on the spare tire, but once I got it on, it's great.
B00R6DQE3G|5|I am very happy with buying it. They fit perfectly to my Toyota Tundra and look very good. Thanks
B00OM6B8AO|2|I purchased the WeatherTech liner for my Acura RDX and was very pleased with it when I first received it.   It fit very well and looked great.   It was tan and not black like the Acura Cargo Liner. However, I have had for 4 months now, and am sorry I purchased the WeatherTech Cargo Liner.   The edges no longer stand up, but have folded in, so it does not fit as it did.  It seems that sun and heat have caused the liner to loose it residency, and I don't live it a hot climate (I live along Southern California coast).
B003VAWM20|5|worked perfectly
B005HR1U96|5|Excellent tail lamp. Certainly superior quality that's better than the old factory tail lamps.
B0071CMF0I|5|Great  they were  as described
B00AWE0DS8|5|They definitely get the job done...It has been 2 months since I got them and haven't experienced an issue yet...They were easy to put together and operate...it's a great buy don't worry
B006LJA63U|5|Works good and great value.<br />Perfect fit, installed in 1 minute.
B00HJVEWVG|5|Good product.
B004YR3H5U|5|I got told I was nuts for doing this to my car but a year later it still looks good.
B009PVB6KI|1|Had to return as it said it was for 2008 Mercedes Benz but it was way too small.
B00809VL9M|1|NOT A &#34;KIT&#34;!!!
B000HJBF3K|1|Had black soot all over it and a warning tab.
B007OZK1GC|5|Better feel, less play, cheap easy upgrade. Takes about 10 minutes.
B00KB2SU86|5|My daughter loved it!
B00063X7KG|3|I've never used a clay bar before so I thought I would give this one a try. Now I understand what they mean when describing this bar as 'MILD'. It's really soft and extremely mild. I've found myself constantly reshaping the clay bar because it just mushed in my hand. It does the job on tar and bugs but doesn't do much for minor scratches.<br /><br />If your concern is getting bug guts, tar, and sap off your car then this may work for you.
B004BWU8H8|5|Perfect fit for the 2015 Rubicon Unlimited very secure.  Love it and great price.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Fresh and easy to use for a not at a fun job.
B0031HNHPY|4|It is a filter wish Nissan would have a better design for the filte housing.
B000CIY71I|5|Fit perfectly in my Mazda B3000 with AC.
B0040CYWX0|5|These do a great job attaching the body panel in my Promaster Van.  Easy to remove and use again.  Just pop them out with a screwdriver
B00FF8PGRY|5|Can't beat OEM quality, look, and feel! Great stuff.
B003A14A3Y|5|Love love love!!! Nice fit and color
B000CMH3HY|2|It didn't meet my expectations for a quality wood steering wheel,  I couldn't adapt it to my auto.
B007QBKC4U|5|So far working great. Replaced warped ones. Will report back to this review if they warp.
B004ZF31PC|5|Very nice product, well built and easy set up. Customer service is also outstanding.
B0002KKTWC|5|Good oil, good price. KTM 300 XCW has not seized yet. My tech gives it 5-stars.  I just mix the oil and gas, fill it and ride. Life is good! Wish it smelled yummy as castrol
B00CMX20H4|4|A Web search for &#34;loudest car horn&#34; or the like will result invariably with plentiful listings for the Stebel Nautilus. It's no wonder, too, as this compact horn's signature blast is legendary.<br />For some reason many of today's car manufacturers see fit to issue their 4-wheeled wares with a bleating, tinny horn. One that elicits  merely raised eyebrows or the usual one finger salute. Change the game entirely with the addition of the Stebel Nautilus to your trusted commuter. Touted as producing 139 decibels (read: loud) of toot, you'll appreciate the urgent monotone blast so much that you'll probably end up using your car's horn more judiciously, given its authoritative report that sends cellphone-rapt drivers and arrogant bicyclists running for cover.<br />Enhance your safety margin and empower your daily driving duties with the Nautilus. The Nautilus is robustly built and a cinch to install, especially when you order the Amanet wiring harness, which is for motorcycles ostensibly but works perfectly for car applications. It's compact design makes it easy to locate a place for it, which will most likely be where/near the stock horn resides. You can even keep your original horn operative in tandem to the Nautilus, which many do given the Nautilus is an air horn, which means a tiny delay in responding as opposed to the electronic OEM horn. Sometimes while locking/arming your car the Nautilus won't get enough 'juice' to respond, where the smaller electric horn will always beep. Small detail but if it's gonna bug you then take the steps necessary, as it's a cinch.<br />Why 4 and not 5 stars? I'd prefer the tone an octave higher for a sharper sound. It can sound like a clown car horn on steroids (credit my ever-helpful wife).
B00NWQ98JS|5|Love it,and proud to display it
B0014JQ13Q|5|Great solid quality frame !
B00BQKKME2|5|Easy to put on and works just fine thank you.
B00BDJCCT4|5|Very easy install, direct bolt on, a must have.
B00KTHZ8CY|5|Just what I needed at a great price.
B002Z5VIS6|5|fit was just fine on my tandem 205/75/14 with a little room to spare has eyelets to bungee snug around back
B005J50N5I|5|Everything was perfect from the ordering process,fulfillment and on time delivery. The battery replaced my old one With no issues.
B001W9OP86|1|I dont like it its not fit to my rav 4 2015 can i take it back
B005OS5FA8|5|use them quite often at a good $$$$$
B0050I0CN2|5|Getting this key cut and programmed was a snap here in San Diego
B00B8B81IS|5|Awesome!
B009X1R8XO|5|Did the job. Fit My 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.
B00204B4CC|4|I haven't been home yet, since delivery of my ordered products.
B009PDC4SY|5|Works for me
B002KDZZXC|5|As expected
B005UGJ5HI|5|I USED MINE ON MY LACE UP BOOTS
B005JV7GJ8|5|I use this product when I wash the windows in our home.  It works great, saves a lot of time and the windows are streak free every time.  I would highly recommend this, especially to anyone who has a lot of windows to wash.
B0007OWD2M|5|Best product our there for cleaning your glass!  I would definitely recommend it!
B00E1SNS74|1|Got these , these things rust easily , just a little rain and moisture . I should have got the Wagner or Bosch before hand .
B0073MG872|1|Matches the Ford OEM radiator for my 2008 Ford F150 XL 4.6L.  Transmission cooler lines snapped into place firmly and hoses clamped on using the old clamps - no leaks.  I've put a couple hundred miles on the truck since swapping the radiator five days ago and it has kept the engine at proper operating temps despite 100+ degree Texas summer days.   Edit: 3 months and 4,000 miles later I have pink foam in my coolant reservoir.  Radiator is leaking transmission fluid into my coolant tank.
B0083H5A3O|4|It took a little work to install. But works grate
B000QTXG1K|5|Super dope
B0073X3DFG|5|Great product didn't lose any reception in the farms of idaho.
B002PQJ95O|5|Works great looks great fast shipping would buy again if need to.
B004QMH0HY|5|Great value for occasional track racer like myself.  I thought it was going to be made out of very thick bulky material by looking at the picture but it's actually very thin and soft which is perfect for racing. High quality gloves for great value.  I'll definitely recommend this over some of the other pricier alternatives.
B003QVIV2Y|5|Excellent.
B00NGQ1AOA|5|Super happy with these plates. Definitely exceeded my expectations.  I didn't think the letters were going to be mirror like shiny.  So I am overall happy!!
B00N396SHE|3|I threw it on my 05 F-150 5.4 and I didn't notice a power increase nor a MPG increase. I gave it a 3 because I read other reviews and they all seemed to have good luck with it. It might be my truck. Who knows. I also have friends who swear by them. It now is sitting in a package in my house.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Roadside assistance is my job and I was able to Jump Start around 10 vehicles with 6 and 8 cylinder engines(including a 6 cylinder diesel engine) some of which were in deep discharge with out recharging, and I probably could have kept going because it was only down to 4 out of 5 indicator LED'S to indicate rate of charge. My customers are particularly impressed that there are jacks and supplied cables for recharging a phone or computer. One even purchased one from Amazon before I left!
B000C42QUQ|5|Fast ! No more bouncin' around.
B00V6XPT9C|5|Worked as expected, no issues
B00LYL6P9E|5|Exactly perfect.
B0046EKPA6|5|I purchased this with the Curt 24178 1&#34; shank switch ball set and Curt 45901 channel style adjustable ball mount. I had been having a problem with the ball shank spinning while trying to tighten the nut. This tongue sleeve solved the problem perfectly. This sleeve eliminates the need to carry two wrenches to flip the ball around on the mount. It's also cheaper than buying a 2nd wrench.<br /><br />I had no issues using this sleeve with those parts, unlike what other reviews suggested.  Installing the sleeve spaces the ball up slightly, but the shank of my ball still had enough room to install a cotter pin for a bit of extra security.<br /><br />Minor complaints: The grove is wider than the base of my ball. Doesn't affect the functionality any, but it might provide a spot for grime to pool.
B000WJYYSS|5|good
B00D8Y762U|5|I use this all the time, it's great !
B001658MJY|4|Does the job.  The plastic &#34;barrel&#34; is a little flexible but it basically holds its shape.
B004BE7VF8|1|I bought 3 of these to replace the connectors on some commercial utility trailers. I had read the reviews about having some difficulty negotiating the design of the inside of the connector. My trailers had 14 ga wires so that was a lot of wire to try and stuff inside the connector. To have enough wire to get through the body and make the terminal connections, you end up with excess wire once you fasten the end cap on. That can be dealt with, particularly if you have smaller gauge wire, as you can kind of wad it up inside the connector.<br /><br />Another significant problem was the complete lack of strain relief for the cable going into the connector. They say &#34;use the included zip tie to secure the wires.&#34; Zip tie was not included and there's nothing to really secure it to. Having a setscrew/clamp design as other connectors do would be much better. Second - the screw that secures the two black plastic halves together will strip out the plastic threads right away, so then that part doesn't hold together. I took it off and replaced my old one until I find something better. There has to be a better designed metal connector out there, or maybe I ought to just stick with the simple ones!
B00CFX9Z1U|5|Not exactly what the trailer had originally, but still serves the same purpose.  And the price of these versus $50 for a piece of plastic....it's a no brainier.  Very happy with this purchase so far
B00GHSLZ80|1|Item was not as listed.  The mirror sent was for the passenger side.
B0084LT9YU|4|fit the car perfectly, helps cut down on noise while driving with windows down some, also good when parking in lot to allow air to circulate, also when raining and windows are cracked.
B00H2TD5IQ|5|It is a perfect replacement for the actuator gear in my 2009 X6. However, the old one was in fine shape and turned out not to be my problem. I still installed the new one though.
B00PU1PVH6|5|I've had three different TPMS systems and this one is BY FAR the easiest one to set up and the best of the lot.  I did the off vehicle configuration while I stuck tire number labels on the senders and the entire process took less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />The display is big enough to easily read from my driving position and I like that it cycles through all 10 tires continuously.<br /><br />What's amazing is the distance that the signal carries!  I put 4 sensors on our towed vehicle and with it parked almost 100 feet away I was still getting readings from all of them, through the back end of a 36 foot diesel pusher.
B000GD5FMY|3|They worked for what I needed them for.
B00G2BU53S|5|I have been using this product for nearly two years now and love it. At first it was stiff and harder to set up on my windshield, but over time it became more pliable. It really does keep my car a lot cooler when I use it, compared to occasions when I forget to set it up. It rolls up easily, is light weight, and I can store it on my back seat with easy. I highly recommend it.
B011RUMLMG|4|Not to bad, fairly easy install. Made in China but the build quality is good. We shall see how they hold up. My only major issue is with the tail light extensions. They used a crappy wire thatbis thiner than stock.
B00TLA8868|5|great item
B00X9GS2MA|2|I couldn't get them to stay on. They fit nicely but if I stand up they slip off and are not practical for everyday use but they are strong enough to withstand a crash
B00D94U2Z2|5|Works like new and timely delivery, thanks!
B00DQW1J8G|5|Love it already stuck it on my easel after my trip.
B00IG8LUIE|5|It was exactly what I ordered and I am very pleased with it.
B00C0W7JN2|5|Every piece on instruction wasn't written down in instructions you had to read between steps to be able to do everythin. Make sure you don't stretch brake lines as you lower stuff
B00O807FLU|3|This is my 3rd one. The first two were from a different seller. I gave away one as a gift, and the plastic part clip on one of them broke. Luckily, my keys didn't get lost. The one I received from this seller was the same quality, except that the letters were damaged. Seemed like they were damaged due to heat, and the letters got stuck to each other.
B000PRYDF6|3|Its OK for what I paid but I would like to mention that the black plastic container is very cheap and thin and came in worse shape than the cardboard box it was shipped in also some pieces seem, used...
B002OAT4HO|5|Awesome ape hangers product received fast
B006H34BUY|5|good
B00NRCXC7G|1|I'm ordering again had a hard time with the first ones....
B00Y1CFAB2|5|These are grate very good in coler the only problem was the frist one we tryed using in the pack did not work.
B00D8BFJP4|5|Good Stuff
B0093A9YXW|2|Although it is the right size I have one or two groves within the cover which certainly affects the aesthetics. For the price I paid I expected better.
B001O01B7G|5|The part fit perfectly, and works great. Much cheaper price than the repair shop quoted me, and looks practically the same as my old one.
B00SH4LUNM|5|Fits as deescribed and helps me identify my laptop from my husbands.
B00AWO60HG|2|Wow - took me over five hours to install - and yes, I do have experience with automotive electrical systems.  Instructions were hard to follow and pictures were very lacking.  If it is genuine Mazda - why can't all the connections be plug-and-go?  Instead there was a lot of splicing and adding wiring that may or may not work.  Would have been better off with a generic wiring harness from eTrailer.
B00DZHXTKI|1|The clay did not harm the finish on my vehicle nor did it improve it. It hardly pulled any of the contaminants out of the paint. I initially used this clay and then followed it with the &#34;old&#34; Clay from another maker. The &#34;old&#34; Clay pulled out everything this clay left behind. That's what I get for trying to save a buck as my old clay is about 5x as expensive. You get what you pay for and I just threw away $25.
B001C6Q34S|5|Very easy to install. Took only a few minutes.
B00EJPOQRU|5|Works good, ships fast and has a good warrenty
B00FH8P1DG|5|Light is really 50 inches but with brackets it is 52 inches as advertised so make sure you measure your vehicle. Great product and extremely bright. Works perfectly as a &#34;get off my a**&#34; light.
B00NEL75E6|5|I'm willing to clean this rather than pay for lesser disposable filters. I intend to keep my car for a long time.
B00042KG3A|5|Awesome!
B00E3VVLTQ|2|If they could get it here not bent would get higher score.
B00LT0OGGE|5|I hope they never stop making this product. It cleans EVERYTHING!
B000BRJPE4|5|Quality product.
B00HWIFEL8|1|The lights harness doesn't work properly and I just bought them a week ago!! Money wasted!!
B000HDF7UI|5|Works great for 91 CRX DX
B00A1AX1VE|1|Provided. Nothing but poor reception.
B007CTR5DM|5|Sounds great. Not to loud not to quiet. Nice deep sound to it
B0082ACF1M|4|So far this was a great buy. It does flap in the wind at highway speeds and the front fasteners could use a better design, but overall I am glad I purchased this product. I used velcro to attach the vinyl cover to the frame to make the flapping noise go away.
B00BMU9G5W|5|Great. I put these on my 97 Volvo 850 wagon to replace the missing originals. They look great and popped right on. Drove around a while with some hard turns and then a short 70mph highway trip to see if they'll stay on. No problems. For the price I'm happy.
B001V3959M|5|love um they stop the glare
B000SBCHCA|5|Works as designed!
B0083SL82A|4|Good field of vision and look great on my 2009 Triumph Street Triple R. Be aware, though that the Magura bars on the STR have solid ends, and the plug clamp on these mirrors will not work.  You have to remove the plug portion and wrap the clamp over the end of the bar.  Be prepared to use a little electrical tape to shim the clamp for optimal tightness.
B008MVSUB0|1|CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Cup is check plastic. Junk all around. Save your money. Cup will onvy hold a can. No cups that is wedge shaped.
B00MH4663C|3|The Good:  I have a pickup (98 Dodge V10) that I drive rarely.  Naturally the battery is often dead.  I wanted an alternative to my large battery starter that could also ride in the cab more easily.  The Bolt started my truck with a fully dead battery no problem.  It was 75F out so I don't know if the same result would happen if it was below freezing or even sub-zero.<br /><br />The Bad: Unfortunately the construction is fairly weak.  It arrived slightly damaged, but since I didn't really care if I could turn on the flashlight, I gave it a pass.  However, during the first, and only use, the common gator clip broke when I was removing it from the battery.  This unit might be fine in some dainty garage in the suburbs, but it just isn't robust enough for use in Western Wyoming.<br /><br />My search goes on....
B00K1NS0PS|5|good harness
B006WNPZTK|3|Does seem stronger but nothing truly obvious to me unless I had s great stock plug? This has gone up a lot since last I bought it, few months back...was going to buy spare but I already thought it was pricey then. I'm out
B000OUW89M|5|Works great under the nails to remove grit, grease, and dirt
B000Q754E4|5|Great size, good cooling.
B003UXZ6RG|5|Looks great, feels great no complaints.
B00P60E4ZQ|5|I got this to go along with a GTX Series Rola roof rack on my 2012 MazdaSpeed3. All I can say is wow! This rack looks great and the quality is second to none! You can beat the Amazon price too.  The only part of this I wasn't 100% satisfied with that the fore and aft ties only have 1 hook to secure the boat each. Which means you have to tie a safe knot every time, but it's only a minor inconvenience  If you have any doubts about this product, don't!
B005NFNUCM|5|This is a good sturdy cover. It protects my vehicle and it is easy to install. The price is worth it in the long run.
B000CC9CJ6|5|Thanks for a great product and excellent customer service
B00DQJA5XO|1|Trash. After a few weeks the color of the antenna went from black to copper. The signal strength wasn't a issue. I plan on painting back to black.
B00802GIW4|5|Very bright light
B001VC5WUO|1|Ok, so like many other reviews of boat winches I read....Mine showed up without a strap??!!! I specifically avoided cheaper brands and went with fulton to avoid having an issue like this. So now...my options are.. A) Send it back and wait for a new one and not have a new winch by this weekend, or B) go out and buy a strap for another $20... irritating.
B00ITBIMES|5|Good
B000IYP4XQ|3|Works great so far. Only problem was the tapped hole for the sensor was the wrong threads and I had to retap it; and it was slightly bent.
B00V9HLVLK|4|The lights seem to be good had some problems with them had to return them trying to call H ID warehouse 800-number is ridiculous but the product seemed OK just had a defective wiring on the stuff
B006B2VDOS|5|The best ever!!!!
B00EM7S414|5|Works good. Saved a lot of money rather than buying OEM!
B005JEG100|5|Installed it as interior lights replacing OEM bulbs on my 2003 Lexus LS430. I have not had any issues yet with any of the bulbs installed so far. It works like a charm. Only time will tell how long it will last but so far I'm happy with the purchase.
B000WOZSGK|1|Parts are defective upon installation, just extremely poor quality.
B000KPU8MK|5|Works as advertised, helps make trouble shooting wiring a simpler task
B00V56U28I|5|So far, so good.  We have yet to use this under sustained conditions, but it does seem to work around town to provide cleaner inside air.  We will continue to use it and believe the inside air will continue to improve in quality.
B00B9J21QW|5|This jack was used on a 3500 lb. Travel trailer. I have  had no issues with its ability to lift the trailer. It does move a little slow. Wiring the connection was a breeze, it took about 30 minutes to completely install including removing the old hand crank jack. I use a weight distribution system when I tow the trailer, to connect the weight distribution bars requires the jack to lift the tow vehicle and the camper, it handles that easily. I use a Acura mdx as my tow vehicle.
B00865EIHM|2|They where ok they went out tho fast
B001PYI8F4|5|good quality, high speed delivery!
B000CM0WVS|2|Nice glass but it DOES NOT FIT a 1995 WRANGLER. The package clears says Cherokee or Laredo not wrangler. I'll keep it because it's a hassle to return but beware it's a full size piece for a full size jeep.
B00061SFNW|5|great product, arrived quickly.
B000BZG5WG|1|did not work on my honda accord 98
B006X262DS|5|Looks awesome!!
B003RQBKLC|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B000WK111K|5|Works great
B00SF4O56S|5|These cleaning cloths are wonderful.  I used one today to dust off the furniture and window sills and they wiped up instead of scattering the dust.  I used a different one to clean up a spill on my stove which it cleaned effectively.  Traditional cleaning cloths do not clean as well and are often left stained.  I have not found this happening with the microfiber cloths.  I have not washed a boat or car yet but everything I have used them to clean, I have been very satisfied.
B00A6AS6LY|5|Excellent tool. Wish I'd have bought one a long time ago!
B00080QHMM|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00FKHKQ0W|5|Item is exactly what i expected. heavy duty and very sturdy.
B0013LBMH0|5|Fits perfect as factory original
B001UG90D6|5|Very nice bag. I'm been trying to find a bag like this for my Triumph Bonneville.  I wanted a bag I can mount on the side.  I found one that cost almost $200 by Tom Bros. see attached photo.  This is a fraction of the price and I placed it in the same place.
B00DBMLY8G|5|I have the other Lisle pushrod tool. Like a piece of heaven when you need a darn good tool, that will work and save you time, when your on Flat rate. 5 star rating for a reason
B000CMF5BA|5|Excelent product
B00GNTHTJM|3|Very bright but can't get them to turn off all the way. Even when car is off and locked.
B00MVMRS6O|5|These small lights are very bright, easy to install . If you looking for a little extra light in places on your truck , tractor or your UTV these will do the job. I will definitely buy some more of these.<br />I am using 2 of these for some extra back up lighting on my truck , Using one for a License Plate light, very bright and it works great for me.
B0027ERH8U|5|I purchase this filter every time I change the engine oil of my Audi.
B000ZEON90|5|Great and very versatile!
B00897NVXO|5|No dust.
B00449AC9C|5|wicks a lot of water as described, highly recommend
B004SCTWTQ|5|GREAT
B005D6145G|5|Great heat sink and a great price when i made the purchase.<br />Placed them unit in the bottom of a 3D printer to power the Hotbed and Extruder at 24VDC and the SSR would get very warm but remain within proper operating parameters.  Use heatsink paste for best operation and component longevity.
B000B8WMAW|5|good product
B004AHAD9C|3|They only last on average 1 season for camping for Trailer Slide Would be nice if they had the Rubber Seal like the Sea Dogs
B001G623FW|4|Perfect fit. I have used this brand before and it seems to be a viable alternative to the O.E. if you can't afford the original.
B00B7ULT34|5|excelente
B001F1W2DG|5|Great price, fast shipping and the most comfortable seat I've ever owned (even better than my Mustang). Thanks for a great experience.
B007P73SQO|5|Great product.
B000C5DUN2|5|Easy change, great item
B007RTPOJY|1|No I did not receive any paperwork on the pump
B00F548X0U|1|This item does not fit my Jeep. Not as stated in description. Please submit refund.
B000JLNBW4|2|This product arrived on time and meets my needs, however, it appears to have scratches/scuff marks on the door and the silver handle.  It is a nice red color and perfect size for office, but I am speculating it may be used or tampered with.  I am debating on returning it as it does not fully meet my expectations.  While the size and features are great, the actual condition is very disappointing. It seems to be cooling after plugging it in, but these scratches are very bothersome.
B00H2VTGZK|5|Good material, well packed when posted and it sticks very well on my tank. The gas tank cap fits perfectly on my Kawasaki Z300
B00ATH5I10|5|Gooood
B002D3KR4Q|5|Easy to install.  Great quality.  Especially if you Carry big items often.  Or need a foot stand to tie your shoes
B00CMFF1AA|5|Everything was shipped in a timely manner. Very satisfied with product
B008VQKND4|5|Works great on my 1995 jeep grand cherokee front axle. Very well made and comes with all needed hardware including nut, pin, and grease fitting..
B00EA0ZB7I|5|great!! love them. very bright. i ran  a bead of clear silicone along the lense corners so no moisture gets in. one flaw on my set was, one side where you mount the bracket to the actual light didnt get threaded. so i had to improvise. but i still love the quality of these lights.
B002W8MXTO|4|as described
B0009JKIRC|5|Been using this easy on, easy off wax for years and credit it with keeping my 12 and 24 year old cars looking like new!
B001O1Y5HS|5|Good wiper looks good, works well. Slow shipping
B000A8S1V2|5|Great view...
B00GUF0Z0Y|5|Fit like a glove.  Would buy again!
B00KUN5BX8|5|Excellent!
B001CF1A6U|5|Just as big and heavy duty as it looks!!! Very pleased!!!
B0006SU3QW|5|Works like a champ!
B00OQPRPK8|5|Good Product and very sturdy, Love it.
B006O74ULI|5|Great product...fit perfectly....stop quietly and smoothly...far less dust than stock pads.
B00108CUNG|5|Perfect fit
B000A8JNF0|2|After reading all the reviews, I thought I had finally found a product that would get out the stains on the fabric top of my Jaguar, but it did not work. I am very disappointed in the product.
B001OK6Q2Q|5|worked great
B005ZT64P6|5|Perfect fit, all parts present. Easy job.
B000CMJ1LK|5|Installed this in a 1978 El Camino and it looks great. Very happy with the purchase plus it is Grant.
B000BO9J52|5|One of the best battery terminal / post cleaners out there. Been using this for years.Really cleans those posts well.
B007EZOIMU|4|Good work fine with my van .
B000C5BMW8|5|works as expected
B00CNEQYF6|5|Excellent, easy to install and holds better than the OEM when they were new.
B000TYODAK|1|The part will not extend. Tried a rubber mallet, vice etc. it's completely faulty.
B00KMGHMSU|2|The scent is nice, but instructions require a magnifying glass to read and doesn't work as described. I like the look but am disappointed in how it works (or actually doesn't work)
B000630I1C|4|For a company that had been in business as long as grant,  you'd think they would have developed a better horn.  It's a comfy,  nice looking steering wheel.  But the horn sucks.
B00Y5GYDM6|1|These did fit my car. However they looked ridiculous. They stick out way to far for my style. Cool idea. Just not my thing.
B0006PU7N4|3|Good kit for the price. Intructions are awful. Parts and hardware are quality. Filler hose in my kit was too short.
B005PUX0YI|2|Case looks great but will not stay closed.  It often will come unsnapped and open up.  No better than the old broken one I had. [[ASIN:B005PUX0YI New Key Shell Remote Case For Gm Gmc Chevy Keyless Entry SHELL ONLY]]
B001P2F3VI|3|The product itself is probably fine however, I purchased this one and it was not the right size for my king pin.
B0096BAQ80|5|I purchased this Denso radiator as a replacement in my 2001 Honda CR-V. The Honda rad lasted for 187K miles, with appropriate maintenance. (I also run slightly less than 50% coolant for my environment (over 50% distilled water.)) It began dripping at a metal-plastic seam at the top, and, once removed, had a noticeable bulging hairline crack ready to breach directly across from the upper hose connector, so this was just in time. The black plastic was discolored yellow at these areas, but is a real testament to the quality of the material used.<br />While I had no real reservations about using a non-OEM part based on reviews, ($50 on up auto parts stores), this wasn't an urgent fix, and I was impressed by the Honda's quality and longevity, and so I sought out an OEM replacement. Honda parts were around $300-450!  I have found Denso parts as OEM on my Honda, so explored this one as an option. While not significantly higher priced than no-name parts, I found a Denso radiator as a &#34;slightly damaged&#34; item on Amazon. So, I took a chance to save a few more bucks, on a OEM replacement. It arrived in perfect condition, in a slightly scuffed box. No radiator cap, but a new drain cock on bottom.<br /><br />The radiator top is slightly larger, as evidenced by the width of the top plastic portion. The overall finish of the plastic was beautiful, no fins were bent, and it came with some instructions. Everything fit perfectly - the two original fans, transmission cooler hoses, screws and large rad hoses, and the rad sat very securely in their rubber grommets on car body (I replaced one that was quite hardened.) NOTE: The only differences are that the radiator cap inlet and top hose inlet (hot) are slightly more leftward, so the top rad hose and cap reservoir hose are a slightly tighter fit, and may rub on things, so be aware that some insulation/protection may be required to prevent a hole from developing.<br /><br />This is also a good time, if you haven't done so already,to replace ALL HOSES - radiator top and bottom, and transmission cooler hoses, and maybe consider a new thermostat and radiator cap. I do not like screw-type hose clamps and reused my old pinch-type ones, uncorroded as they were. I did have one small support and screw that were totally rusted, and had to be broken free, so I replaced all metal screw hardware also. Rubber grommets/supports should be inspected also.<br /><br />This unit IS larger capacity than the original, as evidenced by refilling, and it cools more efficiently. My fans noticeably run less, even on hottest days, when I'm idling the car for whatever reason (beach traffic!). I'm very pleased with this purchase, and recommend it for all CR-V Gen 1 owners. If I'd know it was so easy to remove/inspect, I may have actually done that for kicks, and replaced the original part at 120-130K.
B003XGYDE2|5|This is the perfect little compressor for me! I always have a tire needing air, it's quick, easy for a girl to use and very light weight.
B00FSK807W|5|Fits my 2010 Hardtop R56 N engine. Fixed my vacuum leak with error code P1497. Very easy to replace myself. Very satisfied with Amazon once again!
B00062YUUS|5|Great meter
B00480J4NW|1|Do not look any different than the yellow looking OEM bulbs they replaced. Definitely not white.
B00WVJR0D8|5|Looks great
B00SFKMN8O|5|They fit perfectly and look great! Much cheaper than the alternative
B00S209URY|4|I like them, a little smaller than I thought.
B00IX0CNHM|5|I installed these on my 2013 F-150 FX2 to help with stability while towing my 34' travel trailer.  The LoadLifter 5000 Ultimates were exactly what I needed.  The ability to make adjustments with each tow gives me the flexibility I need.  I now feel like the truck is more stable and it has completely eliminated the &#34;white knuckle&#34; experience I had prior to installing them.  The instructions were very straight forward, and I was able to install the bags in my driveway in just under 2 hours.  My only regret was not buying one of the onboard air compressors, which I will probably add on later.
B00DE954FA|3|had to be modified to fit engine but worked like a charm<br />&#34;removed inner ring and installed new O-ring and inner ring from old coupling
B0010E00T6|5|Sold as described and arrived on time.
B000E3ZLMA|3|Stated that they would fit a Freightlimer M2, they did not fit.  I had to return them.
B004J0HO6U|5|GREAT FILTERS
B002H98X6A|4|Works as advertised, and no odor from the engine after it is started. Better than others I've tried.
B00CEHY2ME|4|This battery replaced a similar one that I've used to start my standby generator for several years.  The previous battery would no longer hold a charge.  It was delivered when promised for a competitive price and worked right out of the box.  The size of this battery exactly fits the battery compartment of my generator, doesn't leak or spill if turned over nor does it need to have water added.
B0002VAZ34|5|Great results! Simple and easy to use, and the products do exactly as they say they will. I cleaned the rear plastic windows on an older model convertible and I can now see clearly (if and when the top is &#34;up&#34;)!
B005I7JAX8|5|This will allow you to reset your oil change setting in your 2007 Audi Q7 4.2.  I change my own oil and do my own maintenance on our Audi.  This is why we got it, and it works wonderfully for it.  It will also read any codes that your car may have.  It is not one of the VAG-COM full blown computers, so you can't tweak settings and access special menus.  It works very well for what it was intended for.
B00JC772SU|5|For scratches on plastic (such as the lower fender on my Civic) this touchup paint does a wonderful job. I had a series of white (plastic showing through) scratches due to scraping a curb. The paint in the tube perfectly matched the color of the car and in a matter of a few minutes the scratches were invisible. Nice material and easy to use.
B00JHEG7XO|5|very bright, works great, had over a month no issues. arrived on time.
B0009H5W5W|2|I used this last winter, even though i did not have fogging problems, just thinking it might marginally improve things (I guess I just wanted to play with something new). Strangely, I noticed more fogging of my windows AFTER applying this product. It seems that my windows were cloudy much of the time (for example, they looked a little cloudy when the sunlight was shining strongly on the windshield), so I went back and removed as much of it as I could after a few days, and have not used it since then.<br /><br />Maybe I applied too much, or otherwise don't know the trick to using this properly, but it didn't seem worth the bother.
B004GERCZ2|2|Actually does not line up with bumper or fender seam one of the clips.,, and when I held it on the retainer  clip and tightened it down the edge cracked where it wouldn't line up , I don't get how it's oem but doesn't line up with the recess it supposed to sit in
B001CEG90I|3|Does not fit Subaru brz, even though amazon says it does. Use part CF10549
B007Q4MOGG|5|Great buy , fits perfectly and delivered a lot quicker than I thought.  Same item as Mazda sells for $40 less.  Extremely happy with this purchase.
B001C9B2TQ|5|Fits perfectly
B002LNI8GW|5|Really good Micro Fiber
B001N4QY66|4|I have used this a few times to calibrate a speed controller for a motor--I needed specific RPM, not too many, not too slow, and I was able to use this to get a very good reading and then adjust the controller.  This requires that you have some little reflective area---they provide you with a little reflective tape--and you put a small piece on the (whatever).  The tachometer checks the RPM by sensing that reflection when it goes by.  If you had something with lights, or lots of reflective surfaces, it could be very misleading, or if you had a chrome device (motor, pulley, whatever).  It probably wouldn't work.  However, for most situations, as long as the little reflective tape is the one and only thing--it works like a champ.<br /><br />My first attempt to use it was on a weed eater--I was just curious and wanted to try it.  I found though that it would not work in the sunlight ---it apparently couldn't see the reflection.  So keep that in mind when you are using.<br /><br />I hope this helps---it works---and beyond that--I have explained how and some of the issues I noticed.  There is not much to say after that.  For the price, its a steal because lab grade or highly accurate tachometers are VERY expensive.  This is all you need for most home or light duty industrial applications.
B00LXKOWKK|4|Come in when expected and fit and kept on keeping on.
B004VQPUL8|5|NOT THE FUEL DOOR I ORDER. BUT THE ONE I RECEIVE LOOK BETTER BECAUSE IT DIFFERENT..... GOOD CHOICE WAY TO GO.
B00HVTAQY8|5|I have built banshee motors for over 11 years, COmetic or nothing.
B005VKLGUW|1|Sucked
B00HWCEWZS|3|Will not fit e39 hi beam without modifications
B0012ETJ1O|5|Good and clear. Not too white which is good since very white lights do not provide good visibility.
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked perfectly, and the instructions were really clear and simple. Can't go wrong when there's only 2 buttons to press.
B004A35K76|5|Was great just like the old one match right up
B005SY8LI6|4|It's working out great
B000CSD67Y|5|Spark plugs for a ex500 and they sparked.very good.
B00COYNZJ8|3|I love this thing if for the sole reason that whenever I use it, it gives other people a chuckle and a bounce in their step.
B00TZF06VO|5|Worked perfectly and saved me from buying a new opener.
B00EC2CKW8|5|Worked well!  They are just what I was looking for.  They are easy to use.
B00JXZADC8|5|Love it, has done wonders for my cummins, installed with 50 thousand left on warranty and glad I did.
B00C7NFNZK|1|Cheap junk. Very flimsy. Product came all dinged up. Could tell it happened. During packaging. Because box wasnt damaged. I sent them back. And bought some real nice. N fab step bars.
B005IFCFPK|5|Geat
B00KQ8XX0U|5|After watching the youtube condenser repair, ordered part .removed old and installed new . works like a charm..saved so much money, by doing this myself...no one had this part . repairman would not sell me this part. thank you Amazon..
B004OI7HA0|5|will let you know as soon as i use it(tomorrow)
B003UVCY00|5|durable and bright
B00HS5JWU4|5|Very satisfied with the brakes and their performance
B0027TX88I|5|They are fantastic, easy to install.
B009DJUXYM|5|Fit perfect on my 2002 2500 cummins
B00KTHU9MI|1|I have to push it 5-10 times from just outside the drivers  window to get it to work with new batteries...had to buy a $45 different one.
B00UCPZGMA|5|Yes this show up two day ahead of time. Good job seller.<br />It look very nice and it fix the 04 blazer real good.<br />It look just like the old one and the color to was the same mach to as the old one..<br />Very very nice.<br />Thank you Amazon for helping me on this one...
B000CODGXW|5|Have used it once, it held up well, hope I don't have to use it much.
B007DKYBXC|5|exactly as pictured I love it
B000CNB586|5|Worked great
B000C57ZJW|5|Did not receive it yet but suspect Moog quality and affordable price
B00JMUKIHO|3|Worked well but faded from black to a goldish color after a few months.
B002PQU7UA|4|Overall, pretty good fog lights.  They work as intended, which is nice, but for whatever reason do not fit properly in the holes in the valence.  Bought for a 2002 F150 Supercrew.
B00DN5YIAW|5|Perfect match and fit, really dressed up my RAV!  Great price!  Instructions were a little more than we wanted to tackle, but even paying a body shop to put them on, I was still about $75 cheaper going this route rather than having dealer get and install them!
B0096U253U|1|The bulb was the wrong type wrong plug totally different from what I needed.  When I place my order I was told that they will fix my 1999 Nissan Maxima but they don't
B005LGTSIS|3|It worked with some modification not an exact fit.
B003Y823F0|1|does not fit properly.. had to flex it to make it fit.. will not purchase again
B001U2D6OO|5|Excellent
B001W0FSMM|5|Works great.
B00BSO3JK0|3|Too expensive for a small piece of plastic and far below original quality
B00480FHJC|5|Great headlights. These are very bright for a standard headlight.
B004DR8JYK|5|Right on time. Great fit.
B001MYWBF0|5|This is an excellent charger. But at first, I only rated it at one star and said in this review that it was not any good at all. I contacted schumacher tech support about the fact that the charger would not actually charge batteries to 100%. The battery charger would read 100% when it had finished charging the battery. But, if you tested the battery with a conductance tester (Solar BA9) it would read that the battery was only 88% charged. Schumacher tech support said that with all flat top maintenance free batteries you should use the &#34;AGM&#34; setting when charging the battery. According to them, you only use the &#34;Standard&#34; setting if the battery actually has the screw in or press in filler caps that allow you to add water to the battery. I then switched my charger to &#34;AGM&#34;, and what a difference it made. This charger charges a battery very fast and doesn't even make it heat up like the old manual chargers did in the old days. NOTE that some of the maintenance free batteries do have removable caps on top, but they really don't look like it. The Walmart Everstart Maxx 75-5S is one of these, and I used the AGM setting for charging it (as directed by schumacher tech support). Really nice charger, when it is set right.
B00BTL9ZOG|5|ordered 24 led, changed out every one of my inside RV lights190,s to these gold stars and love um..would recommend to any one.
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|Great !
B000Q0K5SQ|5|Good.  Lord.  So GM went through multiple revisions of this part (many of which I owned over the years) and still couldn't produce something that didn't wobble and rattle after only a few months.  Their best solution was to sell a kit that allowed  you to pump some thick grease into the part to take up space between the poorly manufactured, must-have-had-tolerances-of-4-inches parts.  I've had this Dorman part in my truck for several months now and the truck no longer feels like one of the front wheels is about to fall off when I go around a bend.  Amazing!  Dorman should do some consulting work for GM.  They'd make a mint.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Was a day late on delivery but it fits my car perfectly and looks great, not to mention the fact that it will save my car bumper from being damaged any further by my dogs.  Couldn't have been easier to install.  Just align the center of the protector to the center of the door hatch.  Very happy.
B009DIXTYY|4|Good Air Filter, and comparable to K&N filter but for maybe a quarter of the price. It's been installed for about a month and a half and still works well. Didn't give 5 stars due to have yet to clean it, but should be coming up soon.
B00JPMIKY2|5|For this price why screw around with a rebuild kit or even cleaning a carb.  Slap this baby on and off you go,  runs like new.  Very pleased..<br />Also fits Stihl 018C.
B00480N05A|4|Was fine, the correct part.  Thanks,
B0028JBEBK|5|really fits and stays in place.  Much cooler in the car
B004MGCPB0|5|I have had trucks with spray-in and plastic Berliners, both which have there faults. The BedTred liner, though not being totally perfect, is by far the best bedliner I have ever used.
B00NO58VAY|5|Amazing... they glow at night with just a small amount of light. Look great on the truck., they have held up to the desert sun and rain with no evidence of wearing...
B00BK7MLKE|5|Very good stuff
B000C9MYOE|5|The part arrived in a timely manner to include the required splices.  After installation, which took 1 hour, I cleared the codes from the computer, turned the car to the 'on' position for 2 minutes so the computers could 're-learn' then restarted the car.  Thus far this part has saved me heaps of<br />not only cashola but aggraivation.  No more stalling, sputtering or codes!
B00AXOJLT4|4|Great
B003ZMC224|5|Very easy to install and looks like a custom fit.<br />Very happy with this product.
B000C14HF6|5|quick shipping and exact fit also great price cant beat it
B0074KVFIA|5|Turns out I only really needed the filter screen, but I replaced all the parts to restart the time to failure clock. I would have enjoyed more instructions than were provided (none).
B0058SPKRW|3|Working when I received. Couple days later the wireless doesn't work anymore.
B001R5D66M|2|It said they were for the 2003 Dodge ;  I had to rework , both lights ,  They didn 't do their homework
B00K0Q19JU|1|I took them to my people here in fort wayne,indiana. they said not to put them on my car because they didnt fit right.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Excited to test this product out.
B0002UEN0Q|5|Easy to use, would recommend for anything with snaps. I use it for my sea ray boat cover so I don't break the snaps
B001AIZ5HY|5|Works great!!! Follow instructions step by step and you won't be disappointed.  The 3m protective tape is a must to protect your vehicle paint!  Tape is sold separately which is the only downfall
B00042KGWG|4|Works great!
B001HO7SVC|2|Not that good. Is not universal fitted
B00NT770HM|5|SUPER NICE ITEM,A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THE RUBBER ONES,LOOKS GREAT,GOES ON VERY EASY,RADIO COMES IN BETTER,THANK YOU FOR THE FAST SHIPPING
B004W986G0|5|Very Good Product
B007LLAC22|5|Perfect fit for '09 VX Cruiser
B00546F77G|5|Works great.
B000QIP0GU|3|Nice looking, feel a bit thin not sure how long they will last? will revisit and up date posting.  12/22/16 holding up so far.
B0006SH4QO|1|This is clearly a scam. It is an empty bottle. I have filed a complaint with the US Postal Inspector's office against J and B tool sales.
B00BCRMAQC|2|Would no fit my care as described
B000KE7ET6|2|Actually the two seat covers are really nice, heavy and strong in the front. The stretch material in the back is o.k. I am disappointed that the photo shows two bucket seats and the middle. No cover came for the middle at all, just the bucket seats. If they had shipped the middle cover I would have given it 5 stars. I hate when they show you one thing then ship another.
B00H94LDG0|5|Great fit work good with windshield.
B00NJRGD70|4|Sunshade works fine.  The only slight problem is that folding it up is not easy.  The picture and directions are not really clear and the sunshade does not want to twist into the circles they show.  It would be extremely helpful if they had a short online video that showed how to fold it.
B000JYICIY|5|Great buy!!!  Quality and excellent customer service!!
B0093AA1OS|4|Hydra bit cumbersome to place in the window & bulky to fold up & store.
B00S0XQNEG|3|product is a great starter but i doesnt line up with all the bolt holes like the discription leads you to believe
B000FQ7H4G|5|Replaced the garbage drop-arm that came with the Jeep lift kit, this stock height Pitman arm brought the steering track back to perfect.  Great product.
B00Y5MNCU4|5|good product
B00DUFL3GM|5|Works well with security system
B00H9OXKXY|5|Ran 8ga wire back to my amp, which has 10ga hardwired to it. These did the trick with a cheap pair of lineman pliers. Just wish they sold them individually, only needed one. Nice to have a few oddball things like this on hand though for any other goofiness that may arise.
B007V2BO0A|4|Does what it suppose to do. It is a bit of hassle to putting it up and taking it down, but I'll take that over my car feeling like an oven with California summers.
B00QMWQROI|5|It seems to me that this could fit any vehicle, i really really like this! It makes my car feel new and fresh. Also im all about heavy duty. Great product. Great seller.
B00RURSUBC|5|Great light. It was shipped quickly! Thanks a lot!
B00JPOOR2O|5|Wanted something with a bit of sparkle but subtle not to overtake the beauty of the vehicle.  Really great quality, I chose black to blend with a hint of something special.  Thank you.
B000VKTUD2|4|Good value
B00TPXG0NO|5|The pop & lock arrived early and works just as I had hoped it would. After seeing how easy it was to remove a tailgate without setting off the alarm, installing the pop & lock gave me a piece of mind.
B00AA7OFLI|5|Fits the handlebar of my Dillenger/Zappy Scooter, and I attach the rearview mirrors to them.<br />Very Good aluminum, not plastic, at excellent price!
B00ONO67GK|5|The TruXedo has meet my expectations.  It was easy to install and fits near perfectly (although if it was 1/2 inch wider it would be a perfect fit). I had to adjust the rails in ever so slightly at the tailgate to get the locks to work properly.  Rolls up easily when you need the bed and has keep water out.  Great option for the price compared to others.  I also have seen a significant jump in fuel mileage since installation which will help it almost pay for itself over time.
B008FCCRMY|5|These are awesome. Have had them on for 2 years, still look new. Very strong.
B00HV2KIHA|5|Made my truck look 10x better than before! Great product and at an inexpensive price!
B0027ITTIW|5|Arrived with the ends slightly dented, but no complaints for the price.
B00KUDWO74|5|Fits perfect and looks to be a good product
B004DRSWII|5|The ease of installing these took only 5 minutes each and fit perfectly as well the original headlights did. I would recommend these to anyone who needs replacement lights for their Malibu or Malibu Maxx
B008RVJKD2|5|These are awesome! They came as described and they were packaged well. I love the fact that they came with a clear carrying tote and I don't mind that it's stamped with the companies logo! When a product is good I don't mind advertising!<br />I use the tote for my laptop because I stored all of the clothes in my linen closet. These have a very nice black color but they seem to be slightly different from the other microfiber clothes that I have been using for some time. They seem a little more slippery on wet surfaces and they don't  seem as absorbent. Maybe that's a feature and not a flaw. But I think they are worth a try for the price as you get a ton of them.
B000GKEY9M|1|Don't good value smell week not strong at all..<br />Had to take it fully out the package
B001JT3DYQ|5|Very impressed and surprised at the ability and volume level this speaker produces. Best $10 ever spent on radio equipment. I use it on my dual band mobile rig and at home on my HT and the improvement is considerable. I didn't expect much at first for the price and size, but it does an amazing job. Quality and great sound good enough to want to buy another one. Recommended.
B0033WNNR4|5|Worked great.
B00TX42T1W|1|Tach works great, but took a month for me to get it and when I did, it had a hole in box and no shift light in box
B00199DY3G|4|Good price, exact fit. The only drawback (hence 4 stars) is that wires were wrapped in soft insulation vs the oem heat-proof fabric-type shield. Long term this may be a problem as even the oem wires broke due to insulation drying and cracking from exhaust heat...
B00K1HPPMK|5|Excellent Fit  But should be made to work with Rugged Ridge Overhead Storage system
B00HRFS8SM|4|Great stuff,  took of the baked heavy brake dust that was on my BBS wheels.  Little scrubbing and they are like new.
B00DG9UZLQ|5|excellent product .. Looks great on the bike !1
B000VB4WBQ|5|Worked perfect. Easy to install and held pressure. A/C gets cold. 2010 Honda Civic Coupe.
B001GC2LVM|5|Great product
B00AN7LTIM|5|Good sproket
B00W9ODC0A|3|Just right for the price
B00UOBDP2U|3|so overall, a well built product. I did have some issues, 1. the o2 sensor bung on the header is not in the right place. I had to modify the front engine mount to fit it properly. 2. this exhaust is extremely loud, I ordered a collector to to fit just after the catalytic converter. this and some stainless steel sponges in the muffler quieted this exhaust down signifigantly. If you purchase this item for street use  I would recomend  getting the collector, 3 longer nuts and bolts to install it, and a few more gaskets, 3 hole and two hole. I did have to modify the collector too. they are sold using the outside diameter of the pipe. So to avoid modification make sure you get the right size. A simple silencer will not quiet this exhaust. You will need a good set of tools for this install.
B00E43U4MS|5|Very good. Looks clean. Came with two sizes of universal clips for your wiper arms. Just look at which ones are on your old blades.
B00GIJT9H2|1|These didn't work for my 2009 KLR650 or the 2009 KLX250s.  The blank is narrower than the original keys, thus you can't get the whole blank cut into the blank.
B0082OYG3I|5|As described arrived on time..
B00BGIJKCO|5|After 1 day with these springs I must say I have no complaints... The car feels almost stock when it comes to comfort, the drop isn't bad either, I definitely noticed the difference on how the car sits right away. The handling is much better, I don't feel any alignment issues as far as pulling to either side...only time will tell on durability but for the price i am happy with them
B00T9W255I|5|Applies easily, works great.  Consider a second roll as it's only 10 feet long.
B005KLBOSQ|5|Nice product. Delivered fast. Great value. A+++++
B00F675ANO|5|Bought these for my 2009 Silverado. I wish I had known about them when the truck was new. They fit perfect and look GREAT. Protects the wheel-wells from dirt, rocks and harsh winter salt and calcium. Also covers the ugly looking frame. Very easy to install, but you do need to remove the tires. These should be standard equipment from GM!
B00NP60URE|1|Used one time to bleed two motorcycle calipers and the paint is just falling off of it. The metal casing around the guage falls off easy.
B00VS0T7IC|4|Accu-Gauge is coming out with a M series Gauges Made in U.S.A.
B0027UPR0E|5|Built like a tank. It took longer than it should have to mount. If the bolts were a half inch longer it would make it much easier. Directions are kinda janky
B00F9LPJ8S|5|Great little battery.  So light and plenty of cranking power!  My 2004 Aprilia RST 1000 Futura can be tough to start and has gone through many batteries over the years.  This battery has no problem turning it over.
B000JZD7EC|5|Excellent product and easy to install. The picture shows the drivers side, but it is actually the passenger side. It's three bolts and the nut on the ball joint to remove, pop the ball joint out and reinstall. Took me a total of 1.5 hours. Looks exactly like the original one on the car.
B001AJMOLS|5|These mirrors are easy to install, but are tight enough so they don't move or shake going 65mph. My RV is 21' long and 7' wide.
B000BOC2E2|5|BEST STUFF GOING
B007NVQ17A|1|Do not buy
B003T7XUE4|5|It installed with ease and its been installed for roughly 700 miles now. With the Watts SVIG10 1/2 tubing, this should provide a slightly easier and cleaner oil change. Unfortunately, I haven't really had the chance to do a full blown test and will likely need to wait another 4 months to do so...
B00N9XVPAE|5|works very good
B007HBQ22K|5|Sturdy and easy to install.
B00RM327NG|5|Great product; use it every time I drive.
B00JJR55W8|4|Love the design and the look.. Was expecting them to be clear instead of the white background. I ordered 3 and somehow got a forth one as well! Good service and delivery time!
B000BOCAMQ|4|Came quickly and was easy to apply.
B00IO8J8NU|4|The unit was ordered for our 2009 RAV4. The package arrived on time and my wife had it installed in her car before I even got home. Fits perfectly, and the beige color fits much better with our interior than the black.Only wish I had ordered it sooner.
B000CITK8S|4|The battery clamps appear to be pretty cheap, but we use this as a permanent installation on our Carrera, so the ring terminals were hooked up to the car's battery terminal clamps.  When we park the car at home we open the &#34;frunk&#34; and just plug it in to keep the expensive battery topped up.  Can't speak for its longevity, but it's working just fine for now.
B00ZS9S1LS|1|Worth about 99 cents if that. Way overpriced for what you get.
B0001MQ7EK|5|Did what it is suppose to do as long as the ambient temp is not in the 80's plus. Eliminated the need to buy ice to keep things cold. I let mine run for a few hours first before putting any products inside
B0068C24HG|4|Quick delivery.  Immediately used.  Would have liked more lycra.  Improved comfort of my knee brace.  Aided sliding off of brace.  Price was good.
B006P7LBFK|5|thanks
B000WJVGH0|5|All is good!
B0056OFWVM|5|All retaining straps should be this good
B001E1OFOG|5|just what you would expect from a well made helmet. Good fit, comfortable.
B0009IBJCQ|5|This product worked perfectly for my needs at the time that I purchased it!  I needed to use it on a daily basis, and found it to be very reliable!  This battery charger was a life saver for me!  Fortunately I no longer need to use it on a daily basis as I did when I purchased it.  That being said, I feel so much more secure knowing that I have this very reliable product on hand whenever the need should arise!
B00BSJ7NE8|5|Love the decal looks nice on my car
B004Y3B3WI|5|Worked beautiful!
B002GJM5B0|5|Worked great on my 04 Honda CRF50 rear tire.
B0036V1LH6|5|everything that I expected and more
B00HSHWF92|5|So far so good!
B00TUHX8HQ|4|pretty
B00RJYXWH8|1|Junk I got the bar and when I went to install it the threads stripped and I contacted them and I didn't want to do anything about it
B00JXCAUU6|4|Shipping process was great like always. The item itself fit with no issue and sounds way better than stock. A slight better throttle response and mpg was about the same as the original.
B006H34BUY|5|Very nice to have on hand for any type of dust cleaning, When you are allergic to dust - this is perfect!
B00KTI01DE|5|worked for my 2009 dodge charger
B00NBN1C78|5|I'll admit I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to car stuff. I've never even had a flat tire but when this said for \\"trailers\\" I thought, yeah we have several of those...cattle trailer, flat-bed trailer, box trailer etc.  I have since been informed by the boss ( he thinks) that this jack is really too light-weight for any of the trailers, especially when loaded, except the ATV (lawn?) trailer..sigh.. But it is going to work great for that.<br /><br />The jack seems well-made and operates easily. This is a clever design and it includes everything including the clamps to fasten it to the hitch.  I think it will be fine for its intended purpose. Just be aware of its limitations and weight limits.
B00FVYX8T0|5|Great look and great fit.  OEM all the way. Fast shipping and  delivery
B00SQ2GEJA|3|This unit is Great, very easy to install. It was unfortunate that it came damaged and had to be returned. Package appeared to be open prier to shipment and did not look like delivery damage.Return was fast and easy.
B00HWFPPG0|1|The sizing is really funny. Visually it's a good product. But I just can't fit into it. Something has to be done about the sizing or design altered to have it fit.
B00S20958S|5|Made a great anniversary gift!!!
B00E6V8CRW|1|Ignition key switch didn't work won't start the bike
B0070Y341G|5|Worked well. nice and bright. not defective. arrived in a timely manner.
B00A4ABF8W|5|This kit is great at keeping up with a high dollar detail job. Quick and easy to use.
B00TWR8T1Y|3|When my side skirts finally arrived they were a little softer material than I thought but overall I think they look good on my car
B00OUES626|3|First of all these aren't junk. The quality is fine although I had to sand the inside of the throttle side to make it loose enough to not stick. My issue is that they are way too big and mushy. I have large hands but when braking or even squeezing the clutch my hands feel unstable on the grips. I gave it a solid trial period but I'm replacing them with the stock grips until I find something safer. I did notice my hands are going numb with them too unlike the OEM.
B000XBGUU0|4|Good spark plugs, good price, fast shopping. Very satisfied with my purchase.
B00P9OEZR6|5|Easy to apply...holds up well.  There is some streaking effect from application which is minor.
B000KYT2VY|5|I received my product fast. I love how easy it was to program it. I'm happy I now have remote for my vehicle & it was at a great price it practically feels like a steal! Thanks Amazon you out did yourself again. (=
B00NEL6HT0|4|good
B001RBCU90|5|Perfect. I absolutely love it.
B008Y9K7SO|5|I've had to pretty much replace all of my window units (but once, cross fingers) and they have worked really well.  I have a friend put them in but you can also use YouTube, which is how we learned the first time.
B004VNCY10|5|Exactly what it describes. This is a perfect gift for any canoe lover!!
B00D5MKROO|4|I like the actual product. The (California) plate is given a snug fit by this plate cover. The only issue I encountered was there was some paint damage on its corners but I guess that's more of a shipping issue. To note, this has a glossy finish, not matte like the photo.
B0073WEZU4|3|It's nice but cuts down reception dramatically
B0019I82A2|5|Fits 2002 Tacoma v6 4wd perfectly.
B0096B0H1Q|2|It's magnetic stainless. Contains iron. Also, came with a small rupture in the top of the pipe (after the muffler). Probably caused when the pipe was bent. I'll patch it and put it on since I doubt they will send me a new one and it would be a hassle to return.
B00E8HGCEY|5|Not a bad stand, works well for my Yamaha and a decent price. Cant really go wrong.
B00JIEX722|5|The license plate lights are made of high quality. Also, they are amazing at night because they are extremely bright white at night as opposed to other brands that emit a blue-like color. I highly recommend them.
B00317764W|5|They are made well. Solid. Look great. Feel comfortable. Functional. Compliments my bike very well
B001JDE6ZW|5|great mirrors, great price, I get a lot of compliments on them. Only thing that drives me a LITTLE nuts is that they vibrate, but the fact is jeeps dont necessarily idle smooth, other than that, they are great!
B004107292|1|This is trash doesn't work. I tried to pump my stomach with because I was wasted and had kidney failure. I ask my neighbor to come over to pump the hose when I swallowed the hose. The pump didn't wouldn't work and my neighbor had to pull the hose out my my throat it was very painful. Later my wife found out what I was trying and left me and took the kids now I have kidney failure and no one to help tump the beer out of me
B00E1SN5JU|4|fast delivery, perfect fit,love it. My f150 is a happy truck once more. going to get some for front soon.
B000XQ7HRA|5|IT MADE MY AC BLOW  ICE COLD AIR. THANK YOU.
B000EDUUIA|5|Was as expected but the price could have been lowet
B000WEOQD6|1|does not fit the 2015 Rav4
B000EVU8C0|2|Useless.
B000ZIC18Q|5|loud as an X-wife asking for more money.<br /><br />only down side is the speaker is not that loud if connected directly to an ipod or such. but that was not exactly what it was designed for... when plugged into a CB it works perfect! 75MPH HARD TOP OFF THE JEEP still crystal clear.
B00WFJBLMU|5|Pay close attention to the sizing details mentioned in the sizing chart and description. The seller is very prompt in communicating, so i would say get in touch if you have any questions. These are per-curved riding pants and at first may seem little longer but the knee and hip armor fits nicely into place when you actually are in riding position on your bike. The liner is warm and removable. Definitely an all season pant. Recommended
B00B5FJP0A|5|Item arrived quickly and exactly as described.
B00UV07AGG|4|I rated this 4 stars because i had to make a few modifications to both back doors of my 2007 bmw 750i. Other then that front doors were very easy and flush.
B001EMHKQK|5|Went on no problem. Looks great, sounds great. 2005 Cobalt ss supercharged.
B00MBRDOEY|5|Awesome winch. As stated earlier, the install is extensive. If you are not mechanically inclined, do not attempt the install. There are like 35 steps, everything has to come apart, you have to run cables, tap in to the battery case, take out the floors, cut a hole in to the dash board to mount the switch, etc. etc. I pulled it off with no problem and am not a mechanic, but I worked off the directions you can download from honda. For me, the most difficult part of the job was removing a screw I stripped taking out the floor board! Really ticked me off! Cheap screw! Anyway, I put the winch on to attach a snow plow....works perfect.
B00165AL34|5|good transaction, recommended
B003TKYWYI|5|They did not fit my 05 cadillac cts..how can I return them.they were nice though
B0088C2INE|5|Easy to install.  Integrated just fine with the Subaru Front License Plate Bracket, SOA342L120 I also ordered.
B001CF3KBI|3|Just is not lasting as long as I think it should, the plastic step on the driver's side is already breaking.<br />It looks great, but really does not seem to be meant for daily use. I need to see if I can find a replacement step for it.
B00GRHRTEU|3|After you get past 30 the mirrors start to sing.  I'm riding around in a Jeep with no doors or top so I'm not worried about wind noise.  I squeezed the clamps to help get the mirrors a little tighter and that helped.  They need to be a little tighter so I'm going to look at putting a spacer or something in there to get them a little tighter.
B004ME11FS|5|Just what I expected.
B000CPI5ZK|4|I checked online and people who use this with 50% antifreeze could have a problem with thickening. Hot rodders use this with distilled water. Red line recommends at least 15% antifreeze for regular vehicles. It's a good idea to use distilled water in your radiator anyway, it keeps the mineral deposits down.
B00BFLVWQY|4|Just what my DRZ needed. This is a dry shipped AGM and I have found them to last longer than the wet shipped AGM batteries.
B00QAMKNYK|5|Love it
B00C2F49GM|5|Very happy with order and packaged well
B0001EFSTI|5|Great little gadget.  Handy to have when you don't have any of the tools necessary!
B000WJJ1HC|1|First off, it sprays on white which is a bit annoying as it makes your chain disguise any dirt is has on it and also just makes it look worse. After applying two very generous sprays of the lube onto the chain, following all proper directions, the chain appears to almost look dry and is a sign that it's not adhering properly to the metal. Will not be using again.
B006P1WOQ6|1|I searched for Honda Accord fog lights and this was one of the options. It is not made for a 2006 Honda Accord ex-l v6 coupe, even though it said that it would fit.
B007WCNI58|5|Worked well for my daughter in El Paso lots of sun
B006OBSQZK|5|Great product just be sure to check if you have a key whole AND/OR a camera!!! I forgot to look and had to order two before I got the correct one but totally my fault! but Product worked great.
B00K36ECUK|3|Quality is fair (made in China). Not as nice as the one I had that came directly from Australia, though. This is all pieced together, and a section of it feels rougher and a little matted-down compared to the rest(so I placed that part at the bottom). It's a nice, dark black, fits well without slipping, so adequate overall for keeping the wheel from scorching in the Summer or freezing cold in the Winter.
B00THRM80M|5|So far it served the purpose protecting my Bike from the element . Am hoping it will last little bit longer.
B000GUWQJM|5|good product. Hard to beat S&S
B00877SL2M|4|Im giving it a 4 because they are not as bright as the agt leds I also bought, but you do get alot of leds in the package.
B000CIQ47S|5|Always use these champion plugs for the lawn mowers, gap them and install them and you are good to go!
B000JK2D06|5|This is one of the best waxes I have ever used. The only problem is the cap.  After several times putting it back on, it actually doesn't tighten and you need to either put the wax in another container or use tape to hold the cap on while not in use.<br />But, the product?  Amazing stuff.  On car paint.  On the bumpers.  On the headlights.  Very shiny.  Very glossy.  Also holds up very well in weather.  I'd like the company to redesign the bottle cap for durability.  This is my second bottle.  The first bottle lasted me over 2 years.  I would not buy again if it weren't so excellent.  You won't be disappointed.
B00QK3ZJSE|5|Check to make sure your car has J-hook wipers mounts before buying because Fiestas generally don't. It's Amazon's fault for automatically labeling it as compatible. I made the mistake of getting this without seeing the J-hook, but WiperMaster was amazing and fixed the order for me. Wipers work great now. They've earned a loyal customer.
B00L9J4JRG|4|Great
B0032HBYK8|1|Still the incorrect item.  I need just the cover.  I have the original aluminum bows (three of them) and the original tracking still attached to the pickup bed.  This is very discouraging.
B00Y5MWCQO|1|This is a cheaply made bracket - China. Flimsy, thin, and instilled no semblance of durability or stability. Hardware is pretty much worthless and won't be able to hold the bracket in anyone position. If you bought this you would want to replace the nut and bolt with stainless and a lock washer. Product said it would fit my vehicle, not so. My vehicle has specific placement for license plate holder. The bumper has screw placement locations at 10.75 inches, the entire length of this product is 9.75 with screw holes at 8.5. Sure it will fit your vehicle, any vehicle for that matter if you chose to modify your bumpers and drill holes anywhere. Not against customizing, only against advertising that is not accurate. Oh, and then there is the return process, which is not mentioned in the item or return descriptions. They ask that you provide photos to prove your reason(s) for return and then hit you with a 20% restocking fee. BS - simply contact Amazon for an A to Z guarantee or contest the charge with your credit card company.
B00BGZ3TUG|5|Price sure beats a replacement clicker!
B00UBWV0TC|1|Crap crap crap, plastic crap, no instructions, broken hardware... Not even worth the energy returning, just threw it in the trash.
B002ZTGIYG|4|just perfect.
B004GZKUTQ|5|Fits and looks great.
B00HZTF5CW|5|Great product
B0023V9FMS|5|Fit was perfect! Easy as pie install!
B00E658LZ6|4|They're great for the price work excellent
B00L9VWAUC|1|Did not fit my 2004 F150. Great price and I wish they would have fit. But they didn't.
B00KYBOIGC|4|Did the trick
B011ERI1MG|5|This literally took me 5 seconds to program. Comes with the instructions. The best deal I've found and it works perfectly. Would definitely recommend!!!
B001DKRM66|3|Best paint I've found for wood guitar projects I prime with same brand then clear with 2k Update: chrome has problem wet sanding has a black pigment   To it that ruins it
B00865TJC6|5|Best find! Fit very comfortably for a small face. Lenses adjust to bright sign perfectly. Clear view for evening rides. Love these glasses and worth the $$!
B00M78820I|4|Covers our large Rendezvous window well, unlike the standard shades. It's a little tricky to get the feel for repacking it, but let's face it, all we do is toss it in the back seat anyway.
B00B0WZJIU|5|Works awesome for tire repairs.
B009OEMJL6|5|Perfect!
B00SY9PRTS|4|Good...that work better  with the complet hardware  for install
B00144EOOE|3|Gasket Does not fit the Volvo penta SX outdrive.<br />The shift cable has no cutout.<br /><br />Did use the driveshaft and water hose o rings though.
B00401NGCE|5|Good quality perfect fit
B008650JFC|3|Its alright.. I'll keep it since its installed. The material is the only thing I was disappointed about. Its padded and soft, but as far as &#34;Velour&#34; goes.. It might be considered velour, but pretty low quality for velour. Its carpet-ish. Comes with alcohol pads to clean mounting surfaces and velcro strips you'll have to cut yourself. If you're expecting nice quality velour.. you'll be disappointed.
B0010E3IWC|5|Just what I needed for the VW.
B00QL6PIZ4|1|Blows fuses..used 10 in a week. Turns out one of the ports was faulty and I had to remove it. I now have one charge port instead of 2!! Don't waste your money.
B0040CYSUM|5|Delivered as expected and as described.
B00F58R4VK|5|Great mats fit my 2014 Wrangler 2 Door perfect.  I like them much better than the carpet mats I had before
B00KXMEMVI|4|Real tough looking bag wish I got black one.
B0014I1BRI|5|Perfect fit and great sound.
B005MR6W0I|4|stiff and sturdy
B0002Q80RW|5|I needed to extend my battery tender!
B00REJXRY6|5|Very good quality product for a great price.
B000ZJ13C0|2|This exhaust is little too loud for me it's even loud when I m in crusie control.dont like it I think borla is little bit better .
B00KCQSIRY|4|I bought these for my 2014 Jeep Wrangler. They fit the front seats fairly well the back seat fits ok. Over all they look good for being universal covers. I really like the color and they arrived before estimated date. Installing them was easy, just time consuming. I am happy with them.
B000LGW5PQ|5|A little difficult to install but works great. Surprised the molding doesn't fit like a stock tank but after install, I love it.
B00FB3MT7S|1|Not the same font in the picture!  Bulls***. I got it because the ADVERTISED PICTURE. I expected the same font.    Do not get unless you just want it normal font style.
B0024NT1EC|5|This new headlight assembly looks really nice when it comes in. It is shiny, and clear! If your old ones are badly oxidized, you will notice the difference with these in clarity. The headlights are bright, as well as the high beams. This replacement product not only looks better, but also makes it possible to see safely while driving at night in rural areas. They are good for city driving, too. They did take some time to install, as I had to remove my grille to get easier access to them. So, make sure to set aside an hour if you're installing these lights. The bolts holding these on as well as the grille cover both used a 10 millimeter socket. Once they are securely on the car, they do securely stay affixed to the vehicle. Afterwards, you can tear up the road at nighttime and enjoy cruising the city avenues and country roads alike.
B000C83PLG|5|As described.
B0014YC3HO|3|Good for about a month, then the streaks were back.
B001D6Y2DQ|5|Very Good Product
B00HJDY6PG|4|Used it in a GMC Acadia...worked pretty well...good fit.
B00P73KWE4|5|Worked perfect for my honda pioneer 700.
B000EDUUIA|1|The product is OK, just OK.<br />The one star is for the deceiving way of promoting this product.<br />When I order this product it said on the name: &#34; 2 of Camco 44442 AccuPark&#34;.<br />I assumed that the package would include 2 of the stopping strips, for this last reason I ordered TWO packages assuming that I would have 4 stop strips for my two cars.<br />When the package was delivered it only contained ONE per package instead of two.  Needles to say I was disappointed and frustrated.<br />This is so deceiving and bad to the consumer that I am thinking seriously on not buying these type of products from Amazon.
B00EVRXW5I|4|Size is bigger than describew but over all good for summer
B000G1WGD2|3|Bolted on great. Receiver is a little sloppy and sounds like something is coming apart over bumps. Other than that, good.
B004WNZ4FM|5|Awesome lights very bright ...makes the front grille pop....go Seahawks<br />.
B00MHT8CM0|5|Price was good and it did the job
B003UM7B98|2|I was using it a couple of times  and I started noticing that it would keep rotating a certain way and it wouldn't stop and with the rotation it wouldn't pump at times... Now that I've tried to use it and rotated it to pump.. It started leaking a liquid and now I can't rotate back and it won't pump .. And  now I have my car on one side with a jack stand
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Does its job. Definitely recommend
B00UVSIJZO|5|Good product and service
B004VLEMU8|4|Seems to be.doing.its job
B003G0Q5MI|5|I go to the beach a lot and carry cargo quite often. Easy clean up and stops things from sliding around.  Great fit, recommend to remove old carpet cover for best fitment.
B000BWCFLO|4|Works as advertised
B0006MRRWG|5|Bonded with transition abs to pvc glue to a pvc pipe under our camper for a toilet I installed, with the accessory cap it looks like the camper came with the sewer line from the factory
B00965DDPE|5|Exactly what I expected....it matches all the other emblem of my 2015 Tacoma!
B0042F8N1C|5|Best coilovers out and they arrived on time!
B001F212OK|5|Works perfectly half the price of HD
B000P70R8I|5|Great coupler, terrible description. You're not getting a good deal, just a good coupler. For some reason they aren't changing the description to remove the (pack of 10).
B009OBW29S|4|Good wax
B00684TAYY|5|excellent product no problems whatsoever I recommend to anyone to use amazon.com products
B00N6D7K38|5|They work as advertised and seem to be just as good quality as the more expensive LED.  I would not recommend using these as headlights, but as fogs they are perfect.<br /><br />2003 Chevy Avalanche
B000X20F3C|1|Does not fit a 2015 4 Runner.  The edge that goes up against the back seats is good, but the other end has a different shape - it rolls up onto the side of the so it is even worst than not covering all the truck.  Very unhappy - was ready to send back.  I had always seen the good reviews on these and had wanted one that fit right -  I could have gotten a cheaper off the shelf product that worked much better than this.  Do not buy it if you have a 2015 4Runner.
B008P74UYM|5|Awesome!!!
B00FXPP0UC|4|Nice for the price.  Cord is too short
B0094JIQB8|4|As described. Works well
B004QEJ6UQ|5|Works as indicated, would purchase again if needed.
B00MRHKG3A|1|Very lightweight doesnt seem safe
B00FLFYYCE|1|Didn't work at all.  Made problem worse.
B004QOK1VY|5|So far I am happy with it. Looks just like advertised. Actually received it a day before I was expecting.
B00RUE3GTQ|3|solid metal,but too small.
B009DJOWJO|5|Great fit on our old Ford Ranger, easy installation.
B002EP7XJ0|4|Somebody explain to me how the dimensions could be described as 59 x 9 x 4.2 inches and weighing 5 pounds.  This is the pancake that fits on the end of handle RD296. With no picture to verify what I was buying, I rolled the dice and ordered it anyway. I am glad I did not have to return something I did not want. If the description had been accurate and had a picture I would have given it five stars. The tool was what I hoped it was, but there was too much head scratching on my end.
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Works and came in a timely manner.
B0040AE7WS|5|Great product! Durable material, clean cut lines! Looks awesome!
B003WLQNBE|5|Couldn't ask for anything more.
B004PL4H0O|2|Get the longer 12-15' straps. These are useless.
B00JC76EDO|2|did not work great. will stick to too touch up bottle.
B003ZWKH3U|5|Purchased this to use for hauling boxes out of a storage unit.  Worked great.  Will be very useful in the future. Heavy duty.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|very handy to have at the beach.
B00DHVNSRG|5|bought for a gift
B00PIJ0KYE|5|Works fine so far.  My first Garmin had one supplied, next one did not.  This works fine for a Garmin.  No big sandbag or rings on the windshield.
B005U30IJ0|5|Easy to install
B010N7RW2S|4|This is real big disappontment and embarrassing. i bought 3 ankers powercore 600 amp when i was in Orlando Florida. 1 for me and 2 as a gift to my brothers.  After 1 month there, 2 cars of mine thier batteries went dead, 2001 isuzu v6 with 3.5 L and 2010 bmw x5 with 3.0L.  First i tried mine on the x5.  The instructions shows that the cables should hooked on the car battery before the provided one with the kit. first thing i noticed the light on the cable should flashs with green light, mine was flashing with red. After i attached it to the battery and nothing happen, still red light was there even if i turned on/off the power on the battery . So i tried to connect the cable first on kit battery, green light was there, that was a good sign, after that i attached the termenals and the green light was steady, i started the engine.  it didnt start a thing with a fired smell came out from the box on the cables.  I thought maybe cuz the x5 is an electric hungry vehicle. So i took 1 of my bro kit to test in the old 2001 trooper. Followed the instructions, SAME THING, fired smell from the bix on the cables.  I didnt even think about opening the 3rd one.  The problem is now i cant return them since am not in Orlando now. It will cost me triple thier price to ship them back via dhl or fedex.  Real embarrassing and disappointment.  edited in 08-30-2015  as i mentioned be4, the jumber cable that came with the kit was burned from the first time use (2 cables in 2 kits). so i purchased new universal jumper cable from amazon named geartist jumper cable. and  guess what. it worked. i tried it on my 2001 isuzu trooper twice. and it worked perfect. the problem was from the weak cable that came with the kit.  the battery it self is good like many anker batteries as long as u use it for charging gadgets.  but when it comes for jumping cars, be aware from cable only.  hope this helps.  update in 10-19-2015  just quick update on this battery, this battery was tested on big power house 6.1l hemi engine 10 mins ago.  the battery in the car is almost died with only lil lightning on the dash, so i took the chance to test this kit on big engine like 6.1l jeep srt hemi engine.  i hooked up the battery on the terminals, with 50% of juice. first time crank, i just heared small click in the engine. turn off the ignition n wait for 10 sec , switch it on again, wait for the alarm to turn off, and boom, the engine is working.  so after 2 months now of using, i started my  2001 isuzu trooper 7 times with 100% dead battery, charged my nexus 5 4 times, there is still 50% of juice in this amazing battery.   so am giving this kit 4 stars just becouse my cables issue.  keep in mind guys, am writing my own experience here only.   hope this helps.
B00JGQLQ5M|5|This is the best known warranty-safe oil option for the Mazda RX-8, and this big jug at this price is the best way to get it on a regular basis.
B00FOKOKOS|5|This stuff really works.  We can't believe how well it did.
B00LNTAQ1K|1|Doesn't fit into my 2005 f150. tried rigging them didn’t work. very shotty.
B000H6QWWC|5|All is good!
B00XIYASDO|5|Love this keychain. Fairly large size. Looks authentic and it looks like BBS RS wheels which I love. Recommend to any car enthusiasts.
B00D46P06G|5|Best $10.00 I've ever spent on a motorcycle accessory!
B00FBQ354Q|5|Awesome License plate frame. Fits my Volkswagen Jetta MK4 perfectly. Looks so much better than the used dealer license plate frame I had. Love this license plate. Very easy to install.
B003BNNH4O|4|great
B001LTVHR4|1|Pin holes did not go over pins. Very poor.
B00EQHBEA8|5|This stuff really works!  I don't clean windows professionally so I have no point of comparison, however prior to this I had tried a few different harsh solvents which really didn't make a dent.  I used this product undiluted in a spray bottle and was immediately able to scrape massive amounts of adhesive.  I also did a quick test with a paper shop towel and while it didn't work quite as easily as the scraper, it still worked pretty well and I feel like that method will work on the defroster window.<br /><br />It may be worth noting that I am purely talking about ADHESIVE here.  This product does not claim to remove the tint itself.  In my particular situation, I received a traffic citation for tint and had to remove it in a hurry to avoid a fine.  I had just been living with &#34;sticky&#34; windows for years because I tried many things that didn't work and didn't even think about searching for a purpose-made window tint adhesive remover.  Now I can finally get that stuff off!
B0013TM0Z0|3|Does not put out the air I thought it would, could use better fan!
B00JW1W7QS|4|Got it fast,  unfortunately not what was wrong with our vehicle.
B00KLKR4EE|5|Part was delivered on time and worked great.

B002N5W8Q4|5|Just used for the first time this last week.  Seemed to do the job very well.
B004QBNA8I|5|Great!
B0012TURXS|5|Installed on my 2004 Heritage Softail Classic and riding is much more comfortable now.  As promised, no cable or line extensions needed for these +2&#34; bars.  After installation I needed to adjust the clutch cable because all the free-play was gone, it took 5 minutes.  Also noticed that the  throttle cables were not moving as freely as they should, undid the cover (2screws) and sprayed oil down each line, fixed.  I will say that the throttle cables juuuuust make it when bars are turn hard left,  although it does not produce any change in idle when turned hard right and Hard left.  The brake line is now missing the  90° Bend at the triple tree. They l👀k awesome, and it only took about one hour.  Overall, very happy. I didn't hate the stock Heritage bars, but they are never going back on, unless I sell the bike.
B00FADIYZK|4|Easy to install.

B00T36HLYU|5|Package arrived promptly, contents as advertised; fit the truck perfectly.
B000FBWNW2|5|Good looking item,easy to instal,FAST Shipping
B00RRCHND6|5|It actually works very well! When I first opened it I thought it would be too light weight to actually keep items from shifting the entire organizer and contents around the back of my wagon. That has not been the case and though it is light weight it seems very durable and sturdy. The sides remain erect and contents remain in place.
B000JILNAY|4|WORKS GREAT TRUCKS STILL HERE

B0050SFVHO|4|WORKS GREAT
B0027AASR6|1|wrong part I should not have to pay shipping
B000WBQ4U2|5|Great product
B00E5OUOCQ|2|This shade is definitely not jumbo.  We have a Honda minivan and this does not stretch far enough to stay put and be supported by the open visors.  We end up just kind of resting it on the steering wheel to at least keep the heat off of that.  It is just a basic silver sunshade that is easy enough to fold up when not in use - and that's all you need if it is big enough to block the windshield.
B00KWGKTRG|5|Perfect fit for my vehicle and the shipping was super fast would definitely buy again
B000CK9O50|5|Great, low dust, no squeal brake pads that fit and perform as good as the original equipment parts.
B00GXIBN7M|5|Worked like a charm, installed in 10 minutes
B00651BW50|2|I just followed the fit guide and didn't notice the other review that was on here saying the fit guide is completely wrong.  At first I couldn't get the attachment off and it was stuck really tight onto the antenna end I needed a pliers to pry it out and a piece chipped off in the process.  Good thing I don't need that one, you have to play around with these like the other person said do not follow the fit guide because its wrong.
B000E28MSG|5|Looks a lot better than stock oil filter
B00T3TQLKW|5|Awesome! This fan is GREAT!  It bolted right up to the Vintage air conditioning condenser (in front of radiator) of my wife's 67 Camaro.  It almost looks factory.  It gets the air conditioning cold faster and gets colder.  YAY!<br />Jonathan
B002G47GE6|5|Bothe fit well and had the wind deflectors

B004ZF35GM|4|[[VIDEOID:8cc0a396603d3d0b1c778129919d8abb]] Pros:<br />Great light. Can see clearly at great distance;<br />Cold light temperature means clearer details.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Heat-up time means that I can't flash my lights unless they have been running for at least 10 seconds;<br />The connectors have slightly slimmer connectors. I burned out a connector as a result and had to build a new one;<br />The seals do not fit well. I had to recycle the old bulb seal on my Prius 2010.

B00FV1MLU0|2|Just finished installing all four rain guards, and they are all molded wrong . This company really needs to go into the field and start putting them on themselves before they sell this product. instructions say to leave the windows up for 3 days ,,, I'll give a better rating in three days if they don't fall off. Thanks.
B000C57M40|5|Really calms the truck suspension down. Bounced it over a few curbs and felt great. Makes the rear much more stable. Really helps truck stance and rake of truck.
B00QMTAZ1W|5|I ordered this for an auxiliary lighting project on a vehicle.  I like the fact that it has led indicators if the fuse pops.  I ordered it on 8/12 and received it on 8/17.  I will be installing it this weekend (8/22 - 8/23) and will update this post if there are any issues.
B00GSAUHB8|4|does the trick.  keeps car cool
B000H8XL8I|5|Just as advertised
B00M45DOX4|3|Fitment took a little work as bends were not accurate for the tight fit required.
B0080HJL7S|5|My car is my little sanctuary, so it's important to me that it stays clean. To this point, I always have had a plastic shopping bag looped onto some part of a seat, or the gear shaft in the middle console. Aside from being less-than-attractive, that is not so eco-friendly.<br /><br />Getting this bag (for a discount in exchange for my review) was a great decision! This is sturdy fabric with an inner lining that is waterproof (yay, no more coffee dripping out of my bags!). The top has a velcro tab to close it shut, but even better is that it has a metal frame to give strength to it's opening.<br /><br />It hooks easily onto the back of the pasenger (or drivers) seat of my car and I'm certain there are other creative places one can find to clip it.<br /><br />Overall, a great product! The only thing that almost got it a 4-star, is the packaging. I personally like when a product comes with attractive packaging, but this came in a plastic bag. At least I have somewhere to throw away the bag :)!
B00B27KM12|3|It is pretty much what I expected, however the caps that cover the screws do not fit tight, so I am concerned that they will fall off and be lost. Trying to think of something I can secure them on with that won't interfere too much should I ever need to remove the license plate cover.
B001KO0QD6|1|look terrible on my bike..
B00S6SV34K|5|Sturdy, double-sided, nice & bright
B0021ELWRI|3|They don't keep the air out as much as I had hoped for.
B006D94Y04|5|Love them. Kept me nice & dry when I was on the motorcycle.
B00FB33POO|5|Great product, easy to install and was perfect for a no weld alternative.
B001XVGCP2|5|Works great
B00R5VGKU6|5|I recently purchased a 2006 Jeep LJ with low mileage and began performing mods right away. I first installed the Banks Ram Air intake, and was impressed by a noticeable increase in low-end torque...but when I installed the Monster exhaust a few weeks later...WOW! Both low-end grunt and overall throttle response and giddy-up went significantly up the fun meter.  I live in the central Colorado Rockies at an elevation of about 9,000 ft above sea level, and the Jeep operates at an average of about 7500 ft above sea level, with the highest elevation of operation sometimes reaching over 12,000 ft.  I have no doubt that the intake and exhaust has significantly improved the performance of this LJ.  My greatest concern was how loud this set-up would be. I'm really not interested in an exhaust just to make noise and grab attention.  That's for pimply-faced kids with low self-esteem. This exhaust has a thick mellow purr, that escalates to a smooth, but authoritative baritone roar when this 4.0L is pushed. Overall could not be happier with the Banks set-up.
B00KTHXZLU|5|My keyless entry case broke and the one I bought from Amazon works just like the one I had. The one I bought is a great product. I love it.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|good
B007V2CL20|5|Sturdy. Fits perfect. Best heat shield ever.
B0017T7WGS|5|No problems very happy with the order!
B000WENDUS|1|Great product, but I have two big bikes and it wouldn't fit
B002MF2EJG|3|The turn signal bulbs were marked with the correct number but they are not the correct resistance. Put a pair of brand name bulbs in and they work properly. Otherwise they were fine.
B0002Z9QO4|5|This was such a great buy!  We contemplated a hard shell travel pod for upwards of $700!  This little guy got us to the Florida Keys from Atlanta Georgia.  We were able to unload it easily and did not have to drive around with it on the car during our trip.  Worked great! Money well spent!
B00ELHT41Y|1|I am very upset because the motor oil I bought was not the right one ..
B00230CS82|5|Fit my 2003 Ninja 500 perfectly and have no complaints at all.  When in doubt, go with this air filter.
B001TFE38A|5|Good sealant to use for a winter prep.  The thickness made it hard to spread sometimes.  Best apply in weather that is not too cool.  I used this as a base layer that was topped with 50/50 wax over a long Ohio winter.  It took a beating but seemed to survive.  The vehicle was garaged at night.
B00BQFRV5A|1|will not fit an ultra classic leather is to thick and spreads fairing to far apart
B00L8FOGSS|1|The brake clutch didn't work on my 2007 suzuki hayabusa. I was very disappointed with them. They are useless i have them in my closet.
B005R4KXUG|1|For some reason they didn't last. May be bad connections internally. Replaced after only 6 months.
B00GWEUVWU|5|Works good
B0019FHSO6|5|I had just saw the movie Kickass and thought this might save me from a few injuries. I haven't gotten into any &#34;situations&#34; yet, but it sure makes me feel protected.
B00MB87YNU|1|I installed the fan clutch on my 2002 Explorer (which wasn't an easy task) only to find out the new clutch doesn't disengage. It roared from a cold start all the way up to operating temperature. Not a pleasant sound. Now I have to take it back apart.... great.<br /><br />However I must complement Amazon for their return policy. They made it extremely easy to return the defective part.
B001J8OW2E|5|great delivery time. product as advertised
B00E9DYVHC|5|have not used long term but for the running that it has gotten preforms very well pulls 28 inches of vacuum
B00IWSYEJA|4|Works great
B00P2RYKYS|5|Fit perfect on my Sienna 2006
B00032K938|5|I have a 2010 Escalade and after someone pointed out that I didn't have a license plate, I said 'yeah, I do need something back there...' I tried 3 other ones before I found this one.  I wanted some chrome, something that was a little different, but also elegant.  This one fits the bill... the funny part was this is what my wife has on her car.  It doesn't hide as much of the tag as another one that I tried; this one would definitely be one I'd recommend.
B005PZMKZI|3|fits somewhat  - you will need to go easy on the straps NOT strong at all
B00UY6WFLM|5|This is exactly what I needed. I recently upgraded to the 2015 RAV4 from the 2012, and was disappointed that the console didn't have any sort of separation. This solved my problems exactly! it's easy to take out so you can still store items underneath. It's fits perfectly.
B00YBLBH24|5|perfect fit
B00P7R05E2|2|2 stars for the unbeatable price, but that's about the only plus side with these.  If you see all the answers that fellow Amazon customers posted to my question about how to remove the moth ball smell from the door sills, you will see that I am NOT the only one who had a major problem with cleaning the smell off of these. My wife opened them up from the box and almost gagged. Clearly they have been sitting in a warehouse somewhere overseas that is probably full of moth balls or some other form of protection. I placed them in the freezer overnight, then in the sunlight the next day. I then scrubbed them down with Simple Green solution and prepared them for installation. I will say that I am familiar with how to install products with 3M double-sided tape, but given some of the other comments on here I wanted to play it safe and at least add a little bit more to the sills to make them stick. Luckily the seller does include another small roll of tape with the order, and I had a couple of pieces of thicker tape left over from another project. So I put all of that together and placed the sills down on the door after prepping the area with isopropyl alcohol and letting it dry. I then applied pressure evenly and forcefully with my fingertips along the entire length of the sills, and used a large roll of duct tape to roll over the sill afterwards. From the picture I provided you can see that I also placed weights over the sills and left them there for probably about 3 hours. I also left all the doors open during this time for the final air out of the product to try to get more smell out. It does seem like the sills are bubbling up slightly in a couple of areas, but I am able to push them back down for now and hopefully they will stay. The smell, however, has not completely disappeared and if you touch the sills with your hands it will rub off on to them right now. I'm hoping that after a couple of weeks the smell will go away, but I doubt it. Obviously there are no directions included with these sills, but it is pretty self explanatory how to install them. They are much cheaper than what you can get them from the dealership for, if you can even find them for this model, so I'm not upset over the money that I paid for these. However, I do wish that the seller would have gotten back to me promptly instead of having to rely upon others in the community to respond to how to get rid of the smell.  I see now from the YUZHONGTIAN before the seller's name (obviously this did not come up before I chose the rating section) that this seller is definitely not stateside.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are OK with the smell and are more patient than I was about airing them out and applying some thicker tape, these look pretty nice once they are on.  I was shocked how many dings I had already in these areas that are now covered up!<br /><br />Reference is a 2015 Nissan Rogue SL AWD.
B008621ALC|2|I read the other reviews that stated it didn't fit good but decided to give it a try anyways.  It really is true that it isn't a good fit.  The easiest way would be to open the holes up with a step-drill bit before installing.  It was a struggle but it works. On a side note, the taillight harness worked great.
B00RM327NG|5|You can't beat this one for holding the phone to an AC vent. The magnet is very strong, but you will want to use a case to hold the metal plate more securely.
B004J0RAN2|5|fit like a glove on my 2000 honda accord lx 4cly very easy to install
B003R3AQY2|3|its the right product but where are the 2 bolts? Cant use the factor ones because they seem to be pressed in? Guess I have to go to a hardware store and find some bolts.
B00HFAHYDY|5|Perfect condition and quick delivery. Kinda wish it was a full laminated sticker but nevertheless it was not hard to apply. I laughed my butt off putting it on my car. Makes others laugh too. Just follow directions and take your time applying and it works perfectly.
B002IL3Q82|4|Finger Tips are not that comfortable
B004Z1JH6I|4|Purchase and shipping were fine. After the struts were installed by a certified mechanic the van immediately developed a strange vibration only at a low speed turning a corner. This vibration feels like tires out of balance but that was checked and found to be fine. The vibration does not occur at higher speeds. A strange mystery my certified mechanic cannot seem to explain nor understand what might be causing this vibration.
B00IEJDT1Q|5|I just got steering wheel controls installed in my Toyota Corolla 2010 LE. This is great because it has all three connections: cruise control, airbag and steering controls. So if you're not sure if this clock spring accommodates steering controls, it does. It's a well made Toyota part.
B00631E14Q|5|Very good quality fits perfect
B0007O8S58|4|The lights are very bright and shine very far. They only down side is that they don't shine very wide off the trail for off roading.
B00N7C2O6G|5|I love these lights I throw them in everything I can.
B000S2U6QI|3|No problem with item, however I couldn't install with out a lot of trouble, no room under dash for access. went another direction for antenna
B0050NOL4I|1|Don't order this if it says it will fit a 2015 Ford F-150. Once it comes in the paperwork states it will fit up to a 2014 model. This has happened 2 times now. Won't be a third.
B00HCTICTI|5|Good lift support with affordable price.<br />It fits perfectly to my matrix, and it works very well so far.
B00EA2ED48|5|This is a review for the 24&#34; antenna. Some people complained about wind noise from the smaller ones. I didn't have the same problem with my 2015 f-150 super crew. This antenna is just ever so barely taller than the cab, but much thicker and stiffer than the factory antenna, so it will still give you a brief moment's notice before you hit something.<br /><br />It does however get me into my garage without dragging my antenna, and it still gets in all my radio stations without a drop in signal, so I'm a happy camper.
B000JZZ1Q4|5|hubby loved it
B003HB5VIU|5|They are legit,definitely durable.i no longer have them because they were on a car I was tboned in and my car was totalled,I ended up needing surgery because I dislocated my shoulder and tore it in 3 places.the hub caps however did not crack or pop off during the collision due to the durable and included pressure spring mounting use to hold them in place.definitely durable and worth what they cost you if not a little more
B00AHRHVT4|4|Great lights for the price.
B007VXTRLW|5|The hitch fits our 2014 Ford F150 perfectly and my husband installed it with the minimum amount of cuss words in less than an hour.  Very well made and will turn our truck into an optimal tow vehicle for our boat and trailer.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00K59LDLG|5|Very good
B00MB0D9G4|5|Looks great, feels great, good price, no complainants.
B00SV5HWIE|5|Works good and great value.
B005R3SSUY|5|Great product!  This was the first time I have changed the oil on my Tundra and I am glad I purchased this tool.  Most oil filter packages come with a small plastic device that drains the oil, but from what I have seen it makes a huge mess.  This one includes the hose and is very easy to install.  Highly recommended, you won't be running to the store for floor dry I promise :-)
B00ZTC3T7U|5|Fits perfectly in my SUV, glad to have purchased!! It is pretty!!
B005RE7A5W|5|Well they showed up on time and they fit. great price also.
B00KX35HTS|4|For 50 dollars this light is pretty good, I've had a name brand CREE LED before I got this one and this one is just as bright.<br /> Just an FYI it don't have a  wire harness I guess you gotta order separate.
B00W4XNQ16|5|Simple and functional.
B006V6784I|5|Great sticker
B00CG8WJNU|5|Really easy to install and am very pleased with the size of the bags.
B004C443Q2|5|I thought these were not going to be real leather given the price. But they are reasonable quality overall.
B006BVK7DM|5|Best ever... right price perfect breaking pattern smooth towards aggressive
B000O5DUP8|1|Plugs don't fit through mesh of cargo rack.  Drivers side cord too short.  No way to change the bulbs if they burn out.  Cheaply made, and the way they attach to the carrier frame is laughable.
B00OX5NZLO|4|2001 Tahoe LT.  Wife loves this new mirror because her old one filled up with water between the mirror and the lense in front of it.  It connects to the heating element and it auto dims.  But it doesn't have the heating indicator directly on the mirror like my stock one did.  The exact replacement for my truck is $300+ so this was a very effective replacement.😊
B00636BNUQ|5|Great
B00843WACQ|5|Great product good quality at a great priced. Shipped fast and easy no complaints here plan to order many more.
B009AA2FAY|5|Great item and price.
B0029V9DRY|1|Fell apart after one trip. Soaked our stuff 😠
B00OUM8GLY|5|I fits excellent on my Rang Rover P38a
B001AJH1HK|5|These are easy to install, stay in place, and provide excellent rear view coverage.
B00KTIUQDO|1|Does not work. Just go to your dealership and get your replacement ordered from there. These things are useless
B004GCF1CK|5|Fit perfectly and looks great!
B004J8ADSS|5|Perfect fit - work excellent - 1st quality - worth the extra $$$.
B00B0CPPC0|5|good vendor.  Very efficient, product worked great.
B005790M52|1|worked fine for about one week, motorcycle would not start, thought it was the battery, bought a new battery. It was not the battery, it was this new starter, now I have to buy a repair kit to fix this!
B00B943O04|5|The tank pad I ordered was this one, however they sent me a different one which really isn't a big issue since I couldn't decide anyway. This is the one I was sent, but looks better than the picture and I'm ok with it. My tank is Red so it will still match fine.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Works well, takes a little time to adjust straps for the first use.....but piece of cake after that.  Love that it is so easy to store, folds right up.  I had a little adjusting as I only had the side luggage racks on my vehicle, but we did a type of criss-cross with the straps and it stayed in place.  We did stop once after on the road for about an hour to check on straps and if you have them tightened good before you leave then no problem at all.
B00GR5OMRY|5|The colors on this decal are vibrant and I affixed to my vehicle's back glass...time will tell if it stays affixed without peeling or the colors fading but for now it looks good !!
B00YB5GAEA|5|Nice little device to improve safety!!  Amazing battery life after recharging with my laptop.  Quick re-charge, too.  Recommend this for safety and convenience.
B004HLWPO2|5|Perfect fit.thank you.
B00IS90R30|5|Worked really well. Looks great
B000BO71UC|5|It really works, I've had to close encounters with Deer and each time they went though the way
B001KR79X8|5|Easy to install,which changing from clear to grey and back. Fast and easy and cleaning a snap.
B004NL23AC|4|Doesn't have a complete list of manufacturers built-in, but does work with CAN systems. Works fine in my '06 Toyota Tacoma.
B0022ZXO40|4|I recommend bending the small hook clips with a great fun to make them tighter.
B00T5G53ZM|5|plug and play - saves time money and trouble
B00JA3BMDW|5|It legit works!!
B006B2YZZM|4|I have used a few cheaper solutions to reduce the heat in my car but this is by far the best. The custom fit for my 2010 4Runner is good but not great. I feel they could have made the fit more snug around the mirror and the sides, but overall a great product and well made.
B007S3RVZE|1|This item just did not work. At all. In no way. Was not helpful in the least in a fairly difficult bicycle tire project. Money wasted. Save yours!
B00AJ0D15W|3|It did not fit well, all the hardware was too long, so it would<br />have hit the fender if used, I bought stainless at Lowes the<br />right length.  The pad was a joke, crummy vinyl, stapled on<br />with 2 low quality wood screws to secure it.<br />But for the money, I guess I couldn't expect OEM Honda parts.
B00J00X5YO|5|Fast  shipping and exelent  quality
B00FSQQ1QS|5|Excellent seller recommend
B00444UQSY|5|Nice
B00KM6IA3Q|5|Nice high quality wire that bends easily.  Doesn't have that cheap stiff feeling some wire does.  Descent price.
B0009IK5WG|5|Great product!
B000LG0E36|1|could never program--simply did not work
B002E571UQ|5|Great item, thanks!
B004Z75I24|5|Perfect replacement for CHF 11s and nearly half the price! Can't go wrong, been using it in my leaky 98 A4 and it has been great so far.
B003N2UW1O|5|Oh, These are really great.  Sure beats getting a mouth full of gas.
B009YCTIWQ|1|The lights won't even stay up where I want them too . I've tried glue and other products that I shouldn't have to use just for the light to TRY to stay
B0052XIPP2|5|Works perfectly!
B000GVM7CM|1|This thing sucks. I have had 3 and all 3 the locking mechanism has stop working. Any key or object for that matter can open it. I called the company they said they couldn't help becuase Amazon wasn't a authorized retailer.
B000C0UMN8|5|It fit perfectly, once I got the right routing diagram for my engine.
B006FP5N7O|5|my niece loved the dog tag.  She is a NINJA in every sense of the word!
B0027990OO|5|Just like factory. Fits perfect.  Used in 2004 Subaru WRX STi.
B001C4SL04|4|Very happy with these filters.  I have noticed an even better sound from my car because of them.
B00WYIAB1Y|4|Great fit!..had to get used to snap closure,  no problems with bluetooth, had to search for where to charge because manuel doesn't give you that info, but overall, good helmet for the buck!
B005FJ0BRI|4|It works on my Subaru
B00SCXCQV8|5|Estan super
B004CGKQNO|5|AAAA++++
B001G3Q7NE|5|Good product
B001RKH7FS|5|Bought this for my son to use in his semi.  He wanted one tall enough for his water bottles to sit upright.  His comment was, &#34;Love it, love it, love it!&#34;
B003VGHDWS|5|Product was as described and at a great price ($100 less than dealer wanted)
B0080JTZA4|1|Sent back didn't fit the seats for my 2014 Chevy impala...
B001DKUU7Y|5|I use Pro Long products in any combustion engine I have!  Boat, Car, Truck and even an air compressor!  My 1999 Silverado Pick up has 430,000 miles on it and I have used Prolong engine and transmission products since it came out of warranty .
B0057I8FT8|5|I love the 88 check book cover even<br />Bought one for my best friend and he loves it
B0000AX4B8|5|Exactly as advertised. No complaints.
B000FQBWCY|5|My husband bought 3 of these for each car!!!!
B000CO7IKO|5|Thank you Amazon Yes it work great.
B00D2I0IDG|5|Good price & does its job well
B0023VF3SS|5|Works fine
B000HLQCOU|5|Nice OE quality part.  Well worth a few extra dollars over the cheaper units.
B0127021C0|3|As advertised,consider the liner they are tight.with it.
B0044AS9Z0|5|This part fixed my AC. It was delivered fast.
B00AKA6NYC|5|Worked great for tight places
B007KCYRZK|2|One came broken. The rma costs from my country exceeds the pair costs....
B00FMV0WFA|3|Fits perfectly inside console.
B0040NMLQO|5|No problems with them.  They fit the F-150 perfectly.  Changed in an hour.
B003TODXQW|4|Only used it once so far but all went well.
B000S0KY8A|5|I already own a B&W 5th wheel hitch, and was so impressed with the quality I ordered this item. All American made, and the best quality out there.
B0009IQZPW|5|perfect
B00X5S0WKC|5|5 Stars - seller accidentally sent only 1 set when I ordered 2. They were easy to contact and quickly sent my second set.<br /><br />Installed in a 2013 CX-5 using H11 bulbs. 4 bulbs in total headlights in projector housing and fog lights in reflector oem fogs with metal deflectors.<br /><br />Look is very bright clear white - I do not see any blue. Very white. Work perfectly in projector housings. Cutoff was kept at stock height and no glare goes into oncoming traffic. Completely change driving environment at night from OEM halogen bulbs. Much brighter.<br /><br />I used foam double sided body panel tape to attach the boxes. Seems to work fine. Box gets warm but not too hot. Make sure to fan out the heat sinks a lot. Otherwise they will get too hot. I have not had any issues. Will update with photos and if there are any issues in the future.
B003NZBHGK|5|Helmet fits perfect
B00AMBKD3Q|1|I tried it on three cars, and on three different computers.  I used their soft ware, all of them that they offered and none of them worked.  I even bought software and it still did not work.  I bought another unit and it worked first time.  Byer Beware!  Any idiot that wants it, send me your address!
B00CAUG7E6|5|They are as pictured.  Good product.  Came really quickly.  Thank you sender!
B0081S95XG|5|Great price and arrived on time. Worked without any problems. Recommended.
B003VBGGU8|5|They worked perfect with the lights I purchase for our canopy on our tent trailer. FUN TIMES!
B007TZ9C08|5|Nice part on my leather vest have a patch for every bike I own!
B008GJXLX0|5|Very nice
B00I5X072U|5|Works great
B003VL7C4M|5|Love broadway mirror. this one was of course perfect and easy to snap on. It was not defective.
B002DZJQ0A|4|Works.
B003E1GLSM|5|Great item.
B00062ZGO2|5|Very Good Product
B00O3UMLUA|4|Great windshield. I can see through it. Although it is a little bit blurry or distorted. Not completely clear as though you are looking through glasses.
B000QUZ572|5|Work well.
B001KO7CVU|5|good
B00C0SQC52|5|Excellent qulity and delivery time nothing more need be said, I need more of these now though love these tags
B00EA2VLE8|4|I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I got this license plate frame for my daughters blue suv. It looks nice, was easy to install and fits well. Has a nice shine to it and looks great for the low price. It's obviously a plastic license plate frame so it probably is easy to break but so far I've had no issues with it. Nice product.
B00MYFNN6C|2|These get dirty easy
B000FT1GV8|5|good product
B004HCQ4RK|4|WORKS GREAT
B00803I97U|2|Get the seller to email you instructions before you instal or else it'll be a pain in the ass. No template with snorkel either.
B000TC6YAY|5|Excellent product.  This is one of the biggest &#34;bang for the buck&#34; things you can do.  The porsche racing steering wheel for earlier cars.
B004ZF35GM|5|Put these lamps in my son's truck headlights. They worked so great in mine, he wanted them for his truck. They were easy to install and look and work as expected. Will look at adding to our other vehicles
B00MQA3MUW|5|I love the frame, but I wasn't able to get one of the screw covers to snap on.😕
B008VH0O82|5|The key for this switch looked almost identical to the key my son turned at the Titan Missile Museum south of Tucson, AZ.  So, of course I had to get this for the controller I built for him to launch model rockets with!
B002ZAQPTI|5|Helmet is exactly what I wanted.
B001C4OBH6|5|Really big difference, lost 1 mpg compared to my previous k&n filter that fit in factory air box. Weather stripping design for air box looks a little unprofessional
B00HMG8QHE|5|Well since my big blue 4 door long bed dually with 26' long trailer is invisible to all other drivers I got this lil thing and now people see me backing up. What an amazing thing hahaha great back up alarm really loud couldn't be happier
B000C9RXWC|5|Worked Great on my 2006 Chevy Trailblazer 4.2 L I-6, Aluminum shafts by GM are not the best. Finicky at the least. I just had a new steel one built and balanced.  Rear bolts only on the 460LE transmission. The Original bolts are Aluminum , theses are steel and with me switching to a heavier drive shaft I am and glad they went to these.
B00029XAPG|1|Did not come with screws to hold face on
B0006I0MVS|4|Great replacement item
B000HNAA8W|5|The charger works very well.  It was a replacement for the original charger which was lost in moving.
B000UTTOFS|5|Is great tester can't complain
B005DJFXY6|4|Met my expextativas , excellent
B00DB8PQ1Q|4|OK
B00KY0JPNO|5|Its been installed for a week, so far no complaints. It starts the engine up quickly.
B002T49LH8|5|In my car and waiting to be used (hopefully never), but I'm ready.  love the pink color as I can see it even when driving in the dark.
B000LG8GI6|1|can not be activated
B00FBPOXZ2|5|This was better than we even expected. Looks great on our leni/birdcage. Rain doesnt hurt it. Just pull back and let leni dry underneath.
B000BQSIWK|5|Don't waste your time on other brands. Just came back after three years for a new one charging a boat battery every other day.
B003VXRPL0|5|Product received as described
B0088C45V2|5|Easy to install and looks great!  Integrated nicely with the Genuine Subaru SOA342L105 License Plate Frame I also ordered.
B00LS5R0PO|1|Fast shipping just don't work on my set up as stated
B0000ATZCE|5|It is a quality cable lock.  I really like it.
B008S0AIK6|5|My grand daughters LOVE these.. vs the FLAMES for the boys... seem sturdy and the girls don't mind wearing them
B00VF7HZF0|4|Nice unit.
B0068KK24K|5|Love it
B001EAQTRI|3|Unit to controls engine noise but will  add annoying static at the low end when listening to full range music (9-speaker system with center bass).  Ok to listen to audio books without noise.
B0081963X0|5|Warmed them in the sun and popped them on! Very nice! Great fit!
B00CEX5C9K|5|Great tool
B00J3OKDHY|5|Works great for the price, would highly recommend it
B00QTESRI8|5|cover 8 R 19.5 / 12 Ply Tires with no problem . Fit good.
B008WOUNAI|5|Bolts right up no issues. Helps with the wheel hop.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Great product, comes with micro chip inside and battery. I ordered this item and had it in 2 days. It took all of 10 secs to set both remotes and was on my way!
B00QNZSQYS|5|Love it
B009YR00MI|5|I love this thing. It powers a 60w photo bulb for night video shoots for me for as long as the sun is down. It charges my currie technologies bicycle battery. It keeps my tires full. It makes me feel safe at home and on the road. Magnificent.
B004NJNKFG|1|Bought this to help me get my directional bearings in our new community. It took a lot of circle driving to calibrate, 4 tries I believe. Then it worked, once.  It hasn't worked now for two weeks. I will try calibrating again.
B00QPQD1NQ|5|incredible!
B001THH790|5|excelente
B003076AIG|3|THIS IS A SPECIFIC &#34;PLUG-AND-PLAY&#34; WIRE HARNESS FOR THE SUBARU BAJA TRUCK/TRAILER HITCH. BAJAS ARE RARE AND<br />HITCH WIRING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BAJA IS EVEN RARER SO KUDOS TO HOPKINS FOR PRODUCING ONE THAT IS BOTH ADEQUATE AND CHEAPER THAN AN OEM (THE ONLY OTHER ALTERNATIVE AS FAR AS I COULD TELL) ...<br /><br />BUT THE RUNTY MACHINE SCREW AND WOEFULLY MICROSCOPIC ZIP TIES INTENDED TO SECURE THE POWER CONVERTER AND WIRE HARNESS RUNS TO THE BAJA CHASSIS AND AROUND THE HITCH RECEIVER MAIN CROSS TUBE ARE AN INSULT TO ANYONE WITH A MODICUM OF SPATIAL CONCEPTION - TOO LAUGHABLE TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO USE FOR THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE HERE
B0066QV7MC|5|performing well!!!  the only thing was I had to notch the interior just a bit to accept plug.
B008DIZ1S2|3|Looked really nice til u start washing the car ! All the stones r falling out !
B004ULDWRI|3|In the process of returning due to difficult installation. Very ice cap, just really rough time trying to fit on a 15' wheel.
B008G4Y076|5|Good quality
B003SZ3JC0|5|Fast shipping and product was as described
B00DYSDSAY|5|Replaced POS Rain-X wipers on my F-150 and wifes Acura TL.  Rain-X wouldn't make a swipe w/o streaking.  These michelins clear the windshield perfectly each pass, only plan to use these for the near future.
B00U2U4A54|5|had all the info I needed to maintain and operate systems. very straightforward and easy for me to understand
B006GLA8TA|5|Recieved it on time, easily installed. Great item fit my Jeep Wrangler '13 perfectly.
B00A2AUPMQ|5|I just got mine in today and it looks good on my white F-150. I like it better cause it covers up the rusty looking hitch. One thing I highly recommend is to buy the deadbolt Hitch Lock also cause I guarantee someone will steal it off the hitch. I will post another review in about 6 months to let ya'll know if the color last, if it starts peeling or if it is still on my hitch. Very pleased!!!!!
B00OGN8B7G|5|Fit was great
B00U2UY1K8|5|Exactly what i needed
B0080KVAJM|5|Looks good
B00N0GLT6A|5|Local auto parts stores no longer carry much inventory.<br />Amazon had exactly what I needed, at a lower price.<br />Took 2 minutes to install it in my car, easy !
B00IOYUE0U|1|Extremely dissatisfied!! This so called &#34;kit&#34; only comes with &#34;1&#34; sway bar end link. This is like you're advertising selling a pair of shoes and only shipping one!<br /><br />This is the first time I've ever heard of a &#34;kit&#34; only including &#34;1&#34; sway bar end link.
B000G72UOQ|4|These things are huge! Which is great for a 2011 Chrysler Town & Country. They are not made of the strongest material and I could see them beginning to failing after a few years. But, for the price it is not a deal breaker if I have to buy another set in a few years. Plus, they do what they are intended to do!
B00JIIZCM6|5|Used in my car. Smells great but have yet to see any real difference yet
B0025272PW|5|Works great
B00I1KMNFQ|5|This battery was one of the cheapest I could find and it came fully charged, sealed and with all hardware needed to install. Connected the battery and hit the starter and my bike fired right up. Has been running perfectly since I installed it, amps and voltage have been perfect. This is a great deal on a great product
B003WLQNBE|5|Cheaper than others, fit perfectly fine and works great!
B007G67JCS|5|I always keep a bunch on hand for whenever.  I've swapped out all my dash and instrument lights out to these.
B00TKNM8ZI|5|YO DIS ISH BE TIGHT. IM DA YUNG BRUCE WAYNE GOT THE CHRYSLER MAGICALLY TURNIN INTO DA BATMOBILE LIKE DAVID BLANE I SAID &#34;BISH YOU AIN NEVER SEEN SNAKES ON A PLANE&#34; AND DIS WAS ALL INSPIRED BY A LIL MARVIN GAYE AND CHARDONAY HOL UP HOL UP YEAAA
B0010E00T6|5|Works just fine.  No problems.
B00WM2I9P2|5|Was mot expecting very much from other reviews but I was way wrong..... This light bar is awesome it's so bright and for half the price of ridged. Yes I know they are the leading led brand but who has $2,000 for a light bar? I couldn't be happier with this I'll buy this again for my other trucks in a heart beat. Good strong light heavy built and comes with a plug And play harness you can't beat it
B00EC2CG9U|3|The knots don't fit in the hook fitting.
B00RXFPAAK|5|Work great. Simple to install. Saved around $400
B0028OIBV6|5|Excellent item. I'm using them for a cargo trailer I've converted to a toy hauler/ camper, to secure my ATV, generator, and to keep other items from shifting during transport. I've secured this item to my floor and walls using the Teks #12 1 inch and 2 inch self tapping screws. 1 inch in the floors and walls and the 2 inch for the steel crossmembers. I put a screw in every hole, Don't skimp here. It may seem like a lot of screws, but you don't want to say &#34;Oh it'll be fine if I only put screws in half of them&#34; only to find that your tracks have pulled up from the floors during transport. Excellent item, highly recommended.&#34;
B00LCBIA1W|5|Man these lifts are awesome
B009216J8K|2|I just order a pair of these for my boy friend for his birthday coming up. I thought when I was ordering and buying them it came with Two but I only got One. Not very happy as I was when I had ordered them on Monday. I just hope they give me both or I'm returing this POC.
B00K56JZNW|5|Very easy to apply. Holds well.
B00LZLR6XW|1|Looks great but it doesn't last. One star for looks.  I had this for maybe a month and it already ripping. I've had a steering wheel cover that lasted for over four years but this did not make it a month so disappointed. A complete waste of twenty dollars.
B0096062K2|5|Fits and seals
B007USR4C2|5|I purchased these knowing they would be of mediocre quality based on the price alone. However I was surprised at how well they have worked out.<br />I stand on them, work on them and load them down with heavy tools. SO far the body and doors have stayed intact. The locking mechanisms are strong and work for their intention of keeping the honest people out but these boxes are not a combination safe by any means. After months of using them the only advice I have is to add some marine grease where the locking bars on the handle actually secure inside the toolbox to reduce the wear and tear. Also add some silicon lubricant into the key locks themselves. Otherwise very good product.
B0066TEW1C|4|Doing ok but still need to prove the test of time
B000WK2CR2|5|Great Battery charged it up and no problems
