B005UBNKZG|5.0|Yes, this product is the same as I asked, and I feel very good about this store because it came on time. It is a good product I have already alrrededor three months with him and has given me very good results
B00005AWMF|5.0|I remember when the album came out and i was amaze at her voice.each song was better than the first,she is a singer who can really sing, always a sold out show. when she first started touring the concert was talk about for months.I would recommend buying this oldie but goodie and don't lend it out because you won't get it back that's how good this CD is.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I seen this Movie when I was a Kid and from then on I was Hooked. I couldn't believe I was getting This Movie So Very Cheap. I Love Amazon Prime
0446554995|5.0|Like J. D. Robb's books, I have all of Preston and Child's books.  I'm almost finished reading it and it hasn't displeased me.  Much like Robb's books, Preston and Child storyline and plot leaves me fascinated and wanting to read it all night long.  More please!!
1452110581|5.0|The author obviously has been owned by cats.  Most of the poems were delightful examples of life with the cats that have &#34;peopled&#34; my homes.  Those that I had not experienced personally gave me slightly terrifying insight into the feline mind.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Another masterpiece brilliantly put together to engage the reader as always. Grisham paints pictures in the mind like no other.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|WONDERFUL CAST, ENCHANTING SCRIPT.  HOW PERFECTLY ENGLISH TO MIX PATHOS AND COMEDY SO BEAUTIFULLY - WISH I COULD LIVE THERE TOO

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh does it again!  This story of redemption is simply moving.  The world will never be the same for our beloved spy/changeling but it will be a far better place.  A must read for all fans.
1401224792|5.0|I love Bigby and the book brings a whole new look into his animalistic nature.<br />Love when he turns into the big bad wolf!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. However through the whole thing I was working myself up for the big finish but it just ended.
1401235166|4.0|Builds the premise for the remaining books to come...but the story moves much slower than the previous books! Still good writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Simply amazing. I love it. It is one of the best games u have ever played in my life. Do get this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Nobody knows yet but for every update apple gets for mcpe on Amazon u have to wait one week. So be patient.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a lot of fun to play.it is worth the money to get the game.good for people who are starting out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Between my book blogs and Facebook, I was terrified that my favorite series took a turn for the worse. Then I read it and thought \\"what the hell are all these people talking about?\\"<br />I LOVED IT!!!<br />I loved how Gideon opens up more in this book and is more emotional. I love the reconnection. I love the Cary triangle. I love the added dynamics of the bracelet, Eva's parents, Cary's triangle and dilemma, Brett and especially the added bonus of Gideon and Ireland being together more.<br />The only complaint I had was when it ended. I cannot get enough Gideon!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this game she updates and everything she amazed when she found out they come with new outfits she even has me into the game and  it really fun she has it downloaded on all her devices her kindle, iPod ,and her phone
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I just have to say that I don't watch many new shows but this show is one of the best on TV.  Its funny, its current and it has a bit of everything for everyone.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I think this game is ok. My friend showed it to me so I wanted to see what it was like.
B000P0J09W|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  The movie arrived within a week in great condition. I heard they are going to be making a remake, nothing can top the original.
8866130974|5.0|This is the tiny version (2.6 x 4.1 inches), about half an inch bigger than a credit card. I use this one as a lined notebook for random thoughts or quotes, and I think it's great if you keep daily notes and use shorthand. There are 416 pages, so it's about 3/4 of an inch thick, something small that I can keep in my handbag. Will post an image later!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I liked the story and the acting was great. Like many such &#34;fictionalized&#34; tales that attempt to condense many years (in this case several centuries) into a 90 minute story, some of the scenes stretched reality almost to the breaking point. But the movie did convey the degradation and abhorrently inhuman nature of the system of slavery as practiced in America. Unfortunately, historians have done a great disservice to the nation by not fully dealing with it in all its ugliness. They have treated this chapter in American history almost as a postscript, brushing it &#34;under the rug&#34; so to speak lest it mar the brave, courageous, glory-filled picture that they try to paint about our past. The result is that the legacy of slavery still lingers. We see it in the many poverty stricken tenement cities still present in large metropolitan centers mostly in the north where crime and underachievement is rampant. It was present in the xenophobic &#34; us against them &#34; mentality that resulted in our Government placing Japanese Americans in concentration camps during WW-2 and now in the immigration debates going on in the nation's capital. Dirty linen that never is &#34;aired&#34; will never be washed.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Kate is now a mother and wife, she has worked for the CIA for 15 years. When her husband says they are moving she gladly quits and dedicates herself to motherhood in Luxemburg. This is where Kate starts to loose it, with her husband acting suspicious and new questionable friends, not to mention tackling the motherhood issue and trying to over come things from her past.  At this point the book could have rated 5 stars for me but the author jumped back and forth in time which was rather confusing and Kate really seemed to over think everything till about chapter 22. This is where it picked up and we got to see the CIA Kate whom I liked a lot better.  The ending, well it was wrapped up nicely around a table. I felt like I had fallen into a game of \\"Clue\\" - it was the butler, with the candlestick, in the library. Oh well, all loose ends were wrapped up.
B0091WD4ZQ|4.0|As the latest in this series is coming out  soon I thought that we should see the previous ones beforehand. They were recommended by friends whose opinions I respect. I'm looking forward to the next one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it. Best book I have ever read since the hunger games!!!!! Perfect second book!!! You have to love it.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|My son and I enjoyed the movie very much.  The movie had good action and a good story line.  And we enjoy Mark Wahlberg as an actor.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this is a great game. very addivtive and great for little children. I think. yes this game is fun I love it
B001EDU7XM|1.0|When I ordered this CD from your company I didn't expect to have to check what language it would be in. After all, English is still the language of the US - at least so far. Therefore I had to go through the inconvenience of returning it since my Spanish doesn't extend beyond the tourist &#34;donde esta&#34; or &#34;quanto es&#34;.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Until now, I had always accepted as fact that the glove maker's son from Stafford was the the genius author who gave the world its greatest wordsmith and the English language its grandeur and magnificence. However, the movie did raise some curious questions and I was interested. As a result I have read almost a dozen scholarly books making the case for Edward deVere. They are powerfully persuasive and, in the intrigue of the English court, the deadly and bloody struggle between Reformation minded English and the Roman church, the arguments ring true. The answer is still a contentious issue but I am finding my self moving towards the Oxfordian view.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love the premise of the movie and the ending.  The collection is great too because I've got 3 different versions I can watch.  I arrived very quickly too!
B00992CF6W|2.0|Not a ranking for the game, I love that, but a ranking for HOW SLOW THEY GET UPDATES. Can't play with my friends.
B00AG51V8E|5.0|movie was very good, story line moving, movie fun to watch, one of those you don't leave the couch until it is over. Dvd arrives in very good shape and never a problem with this vendor!!
159463176X|4.0|This book reads like an ensemble cast in a movie. There are many stories of people's lived that intersect. I was not sure though which story was the main story until well into the book. Some of the stories obviously moved the main story forward. Others were more subtle. I am not sure if a few of them were necessary, but I do understand what the author was trying to accomplish. My one complained was the way time shifted back and forth. Sometimes it was a bit confusing and could have been handled better.<br /><br />In the end, the author did what he set out to do. He reeled me in and made me emotionally invested in the characters.
0545265355|5.0|The set was in pristine condition. The books are an amazing read! A must have for anyone that loved the Harry Potter and/or Twilight series.
B00CWVGS10|3.0|I watched the movie with an open mind and if you read the books you would understand all the key elements, details and nuance that was left out of it.  You can have a good movie that follows the story line of a book.  Just look at S.E. Hinton's books that were turned into movies.  They literally changed up most of the characters and omitted key characters that would play an even more important role in subsequent movies. Details that would have made the movie great were left out that would have been easily represented.  If the movie had followed the book more closely it would have been a movie that would have kept you on your seat waiting, instead of rushing through it and pretty much re-writing the whole thing.  \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" followed the book better than this, which isn't saying much. The characters lacked in the movie what they had in the book, depth, passion and what happened to Link?  His character was so toned down that he seemed trivial to the story.  Part of what made the story was the unbreakable bond and friendship of Link and Ethan.  As for Ama that was the worst injustice of all.  What happened to the momma bear with the \\"one eyed menace\\"?  I can't believe the writers could be happy with such a butchering of their work. It would have been an okay movie in and of itself but if they had followed to the true story line it would have been 10 times better than Twilight ever thought of being.  I only hope that \\"The Vampire Academy\\" series turned movie doesn't fall into the same pitfall as this one has.  So very disappointed.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|we loved the lord of the rings series and the hobbit series is just as great.  would recommend purchasing to watch this christmas right before sequal comes out in theatres
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am so in love with this series that it's painful when one of the books comes to an end.  I can hardly wait for book 6 to be completed so I can get my grubby hands on it!!  George RR is a classic, smart and masculine writer.  These books are not for the faint of heart or those who think the hero always wins in the end and rides off into the sunset with the girl.  This series tugs at your deepest of emotions, leaves you reeling, biting nails and up all night reading what comes next.  If there were a way to give this series 10 stars I would.  Start reading!!
B008JFUMDS|5.0|Now You See Me is take what you know about the Ocean's Eleven movies and other caper films with magic used as a secret alias and what do you get is a better than expected caper film that ranges from Morgan Freeman to Michael Caine. It can keep you guessing with so many plot twists to keep you entertained and happy all the way to the very end and talking about it with friends or perhaps the person sitting next to you. This breaks the history of movies that have magic themes in the film while this film is more that a magic flick but a fast-paced action movie, it's a fresah film to get people away from the big mighty blockbusters out there right now and I will get this movie when it arrives on DVD very soon!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the game and the graphics  but the number of advertisements that pop up are way over the top and very annoying.
193700788X|5.0|I was terrified to read this story because of the bad reviews that I have read. I didn't understand why everyone was hating it because I tried to stay away from spoilers. I have loved this series since I started reading them seven years ago, since then they have become my favourite series by far, I hate seeing it end but I don't believe it could have ended any better, I don't want to give away any spoilers So this is going to be hard to Review, I will have Spoilers from earlier books.<br /><br />Sookies Life<br /><br />Sookie is the main character, she is a waitress for Merlottes Bar and Diner, She is a Telepath and part fairy, her life has been horrible. Full of violence and mistreatment, But along her adventures she has changed from an Insecure waitress, to a Strong, Loyal, Loving Kickass Heroine. She never wants to be a Vampire because she loves the sun, her family and being human/fae.<br /><br />The Men in Sookies Life<br /><br />Bill<br /><br />Bill is a Vampire and Sookie's first love. The first few books of the Series I thought Bill was great, he was loving and trying to make himself into a good mainstreaming Vampire. Later Bill, after a few revelations, Bill messed up badly and broke Sookies heart. Bill has been trying to get back with Sookie ever since. I don't think Bill would make a great lifetime partner for Sookie, although he loves Sookie he can become very obsessed with his job, as well as selfish.<br /><br />Alcide<br /><br />Alcide is a hot sexy werewolf, He is Packmaster for the Shreveport Pack. Although Alcide is a wolf and alive I don't think I would like to see Sookie Settle with Alcide, he has a lot of emotional baggage, plus as Packmaster he is always going to be in danger and the Wolves are just too violent for a human to be part of long-term.<br /><br />Quinn<br /><br />Quinn was a good-looking distraction.<br /><br />Eric<br /><br />I have always through the whole series been Team Eric with his warped sense of humor, His strong position with the Vampires, Sexy, Confident and just a tad Evil. He has the whole loyal, loving bad boy thing happening and he does it so well. He is more the type of Vampire I like not afraid to drink straight from the Vein, not afraid to kill, he is a big scary Vamp that you want on your side. But as much as I love Eric, Sookie doesn't want to be a Vampire. Really how well could a human and Vampire last together, plus Eric is impatient and doesn't like being told no.  Eric is such a wonderful sexy vampire fantasy, but he is not one to settle down to marriage forever with a human. I don't see him as relationship material, He is wild and should not be tied down. If Sookie wanted to turn into a Vampire I would want her to spend eternity with Eric. In the last few books I have been losing Interest in Eric because when placed into a loving relationship with Sookie, he became soft, I didn't see him as a bad boy anymore just whipped and I hated it.<br /><br />Sam<br /><br />If I could imagine a happy ending for Sookie as a human, This is my pick Sam is beautiful, loyal, Kickass, Sexy and Protective.  He has always been on the sideline of Sookie's life ready to jump in when she needs him. He has bad luck with choosing the wrong woman, but has shown on more than one occasion that he has strong feelings for Sookie. Sam can give Sookie everything she wants in life, Security, Protection, Babies and the sunshine.<br /><br />I loved the plot of Dead Ever After, I thought that loose ends were tied up nicely, I wasn't left hanging not knowing what was going to happen in Sookie's life. The only problem I had with the plot was that I found Sookie to be unemotional, she is usually a very emotional person and after the turmoil of Eric trying to break the engagement with the Queen, I felt sookie was quite out of character in the way she was reacting. Honestly I could not have been happier by the ending, I can now put the Sookieverse to rest, knowing everything is alright in their world.<br /><br/>On a side note I would love to see a spin-off with Hunter growing up I think that would be great.<br /><br />What did you think of Sookie's happy ever after?/>On a side note I would love to see a spin-off with Hunter growing up I think that would be great.<br /><br />What did you think of Sookie's happy ever after?
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is good and I play frequently.<br />I am disappointed because I purchased a 450 pearls and they never got added to my account.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I used to sit and watch and beg for a turn but I finally got it myself now I play all the time I don't set it down
B00992CF6W|5.0|Yeah...I'm waiting for 0.6.2&hellip;and it hisses me off that all my friends have iPods and they have the update and I'm still a stupid 0.6.1.
0307719774|5.0|Just got it this year, but I love it anyway! This is a fantastic idea. I look forward to answering a new question everyday. I can't wait to compare my answers next year. Highly recommended.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Jewel case crumpled in bottom corner arrived in jiffy bag.<br />Film is excellent. Blu ray is multi-region BUT the dvd IS NOT.<br />Otherwise happy as a Hulk with Loki.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this show - even went out and bought the books!  Great writing!  Recommend show to everyone (except minors) as too much nudity.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I went through almost about 1 headphone a yr, but since stopped after getting the Corsair USB HS1, but after 3 years of abuse, it finally stop working. I kept on stepped it on it's controller since it had a really long cord, so decided that a wired headphone is no place for me. Looked at all the wireless headphone that's around. This one turn out to be the cheapest(06/13). I bought the G300 for work yrs ago, and it was great. The G930 turn out to be much better. The sound is really clear, blocks out outside noise for me. And the sound doesn't leak.<br /><br />Update 06/20/13<br /><br />Pro:<br />Sound and voice both came out very clear and clean.<br />Long Rang.<br />No cord to step on<br />Replaceable battery.<br />Replaceable receiver.<br />Can be used while charging.<br />can be charged with any usb chargers instead of the pc.<br /><br />After using this for everyday for a week, it works great, and all the Cons I had when I first got it;<br />turn out to be nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Other:<br />The sound is clear enough I can hear sound I never heard before when listening my music collection.<br />The G keys doesn't work, or haven't config them yet. Either case, I don't really care.<br />Got this for gaming. Sound is on par with the old HS1, but much better bass.<br />It's comfortable for a good 4+ hour online gaming.
B00992CF6W|4.0|cool but really my kindle fire wont down load it! I'm getting really mad hope it works later. but I play on xbox 360. I'm weaponsdealer02.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I loved this movie, very original story line.  Well acted, and definitely a feel good movie (with a little gore).
B009IUH1N2|3.0|No one else has complained about this so I don't know if this is a fluke, but the paid version has ads on it now. I don't know if this is new or I just didn't notice it before (my 2nd time playing). The game itself is very good. I discovered an area that you can get extra rewinds in a challenge which was fun, but I haven't tried the rewinds, so I don't know if they're beneficial. Since I know that I don't have to pay for more, I'll try them out now. :) In conclusion, boo for the ads in a paid app, yay for the gameplay.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|This movie always makes me laugh as well as appreciate people who see things a little bit differently than many of us. I don't know how I could give the Addams any less than 5stars just because it takes me back to my childhood. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and have had it on both tablet, computer and phone, but the updates are way too slow. I much prefer minecraft from Apple store.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I made this purchase for my grand daughter. Although I have not personally played the game, I must say that she really enjoys playing it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|It was the follow up to the mystery of the death of agent Pendergast's wife from two previous novels dealing with his wife
B0063M22QO|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is played in the same manner as the original computer mahjong. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys puzzles.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a very fun game. Worth two bucks definitely.<br />Just wish it was a bit longer. Kind of tricky to play if you aren't into puzzle games.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|all the top tracks from this legendary band with the legendary lead singer how things began for those who wish to learn about musical roots!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This  is a great endless runner.<br />It's especially good if you have gotten bored of temple run, the music is better, it has more interesting obstacles. It has James Franco lol.<br /><br />It's pretty fun I suggest it.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is really fun. Great action with perfectly timed comic touches. It's really a great thrill ride. I bought it as a Father's Day Gift too.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|a little boring. not too long. the whole goal of the story is to enjoy each moment of life and try not to rush it or slow it down. over all, it's okay
037582913X|5.0|This is a fun book I remembered as a child.  It's a great one to read aloud to children as the desperation of Grover grows as each page turns. I regularly gift this book.
B008Y212PI|4.0|i started with a free app and was hooked! i have purchased several others from FlipPix. I look forward to the next ones.
B004ZJZPX4|5.0|This is one of those movies where you pick up something new during every viewing.  The cast is really great-- top notch-- and the script is smart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As dictated by my 11 year old son:  It's exploring and creating currents in the water.  Digging, climbing and placing stuff is fun too.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|I like this game and I like all the free flow games. the game is fun game. will share it with everyone
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I have heard of the show \\"Castle\\" but have only seen one show. So when I chose this book I only had one question...Is this a \\"between the shows book\\"?<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I found a funny, thrilling and enjoyable read! Some what reminiscent of the JD Robb \\"In Death\\" series, but that may just be the setting...I found it a lot of fun. I will be reading the next one!
B001OST0LW|5.0|One of my favorite batman movies and it came in great condition. I love love it. Great item for me.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of the novel.  Well written and intriguing and the movie was very good, even with English subtitles.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|really engaging and clever story mostly, was a bit too far fetched but still enjoyable..unsatisfying ending I thought but others may be fine with it
B002RHGYOA|5.0|I enjoyed the fast pace of the novel.  Well written and intriguing and the movie was very good, even with English subtitles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When you play temple run it is hard at first but gets easier the more you play and is so much fun for people all ages!
B0096BIENY|3.0|it was a  middle of the road. I prefer classics ,<br />just my own taste<br /><br />great voices, but song choice isn't right
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome!!! I was first introduced by a friend and they showed me how to connect with other and to build and kill zombies and it is all ways fun and we never get bored or tired of it!
B0098460O4|5.0|great voices and great song choice.<br /><br />I prefer less instruments but still great<br /><br />I want more classic choices from them. I'd buy another
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Pretty good read.  It kept me interested throughout.  I like the interaction between them.  I will read more of this series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille writes another great tale featuring John Corey.  It is a fun and quick read in the sense that the story will keep you wanting to read more.  Corey is again at his best wit and thinks the things we all would say, but he says what we all wish we can say.  DeMille did his research well on the culture of the Yeman.  5 stars and look forward to the next book - bet it is one where another 'spook' resurfaces!!!!!
0553573411|5.0|This was my first attempt at the fantasy genre.  I looked at reviews on Amazon for a while and came across the first book at a garage sale. I was hooked immediately. I love the relationship between the Fool and Fitz and was very emotionally invested.<br /><br />Great series to get started for those of you that aren't sure about fantasy.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I thought this was a delicious read! I think most men are a little bit like Don. It was light hearted & funny. Rosie was perfectly unsuitable for Don & I am sure their marriage will be better than most! I would recommend this book, in fact, I have recommended this book to my fellow bookclub members, friends & family! It doesn't stretch the brain cells very much but it is wonderful & sometimes you just want a jolly good page turner. Worth reading.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a read that keeps you interested enough to finish. Kind of repetitive after a while although entertaining and creative. Not to sure I would recommend it though.
B004GYY714|4.0|I can listen to the radio stations in Hong Kong, it is awsome! It makes me feel like home. Great Job!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really loved these stories. I e expected more for the final book. I guess she. Wanted to get out of the Sookie universe as soon a  she could.
B00B4804KS|5.0|When I first heard that they were doing a 3D bluray release of Jurassic Park I knew right away that I had to get it!  It's been years since I've taken the time to watch the original movie, but from what I remembered it was a great movie from my younger days.<br /><br />Watching this in 3D on my LG 55&#34; Passive tv, it was utterly amazing!  I have several 3D versions of movies, and I continue to update my library as I go, but in all honesty this was the best 3D rerelease I've seen yet!<br /><br />I'm not up on the technical terms used with describing 3D, but can tell you that I had absolutely no issues with blurriness, or out of focus scenes.<br /><br />I would definately recommend the 3D version!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game but updates are very slow. But Again BEST GAME EVER I  LLOOOVE  minecraft  minecraft is t he BEST I have to put so many words (20) Into  this so don't mind this part
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Brilliant...Wonderful...Perfect...Amazing...CROSSFIRE!!!<br /><br />I can't say enough how much I enjoyed book 3!!  I know that there are some bad reviews because people are upset that a 3 book series has been stretched into a 5 book series, but honestly, I love reading about Gideon and Eva and if I get to experience 2 more books of them, I say ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY!!!!  Why would anyone that's a fan of these books ever want it to end????<br /><br />I loved how Gideon and Eva grew as a couple in EWY and dealt with some serious drama, but they didn't run...they held it together and became stronger.<br /><br />I can't wait for book 4...this series ROCKS!!!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|It's a virtual world where spider-man can save the day.Before you play the game it gives you a little preview about his life and what he's about to do.
B000WTXD30|5.0|I play it all the time and now have copied the songs to iTunes and my Android phone. I still play the CD at home.
B004UID2LC|5.0|You get to preview your song,movie,or little clips on it if you would like to.But instead plugging it on a computer you have  app instead.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|OK, so I'm still in love with the characters and storyline, but totally disappointed with the fact that I have to wait for the next book. AGAIN! I should know better than to start a series when it's not complete. If I didn't like the amount of hot stuff I got out of this book I would have rated it even lower, but since it was entertaining and the only big problem I had with it was the way it ended... Well, here's to the next one in the series. Hope it won't leave me hanging quite as much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on Xbox if anyone reads this my name is skullcrusher 622 but minecraft pe just needs Redstone things more food enchantment tables and portals
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I like these movies but this one lacked something.  Not sure what it is but it was jut ok.  Seemed really short, like they wanted to make another movie but didn't really know what to do.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|It's really good, needs a sequel and most likely an hd version.  Then maybe it can be better than angry birds series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, so as soon as minecraft came out for my kindle on Amazon, I was like mentally screaming cause I was so excited. Then I saw the price and I thought really, seven dollars?.....but I got it anyway. So I was still excited, but I was wondering if I'd made a good decision in buying it. In a few seconds of playing it, all my questions were answered. 1. The price was way less expensive than the price of an account on pc, which is around $26.00.<br />2. It was definitely worth buying.<br />3. Minecraft Pocket Edition was easy to work and fun.....not with complex controls or anything.<br />If you're thinking about purchasing this app, don't even hesitate! It's the most fun app I have. I love it!

125000098X|1.0|To meet a deadline Archer only wrote 1/2 a book. The 1st  two were great, but this was a waste of time. I will not be ordering the other 1/2. What a disapointment.
159463176X|5.0|I read many books a week.  I've learned how to speed read, skipping paragraphs of blah blah descriptions.<br /><br />However, this book demands savoring each and every word.  I do not have the skill to sufficiently describe how engrossing this book is.  It spans several decades, switches from third person to first person (not always the same \\"first person\\"), goes from country to country, yet there is no confusion--only deeper understanding of the Afghan people.<br /><br />Each of his books are self-standing, but no book should be missed.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I have read his blog and other writing attempting to find value in his self depreciating style of contributions to reading material and different thought processes. I just get the feeling he is laughing at you buying the sort of material he puts out......if so.......well he has accomplished what he wanted to achieve and we are now part of his standing army of 30%'s... hate him..... love him....or couldn't give a s***, any one of the options mean you have noticed him
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Great music and musicians, would be nice to see and listen to songs from other countries as well. Great message. Worth supporting this cause!!!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The 20/20 Experience is an album like no other. Sure there are those will say that Mr. Timberlake is trying to copy Robin Thicke, Musiq Soulchild, Prince,  and others that are more instrumental focused. But just like there will only be one Michael, there will always only be one Justin. Some people have complained that the tracks are \\"too long\\" and that the extended music is \\"fluff\\" and \\"distracting\\". They do not appreciate the complexity and the musicianship that Justin possess. We got a small glimpse of his capabilities and creativity in \\"FutureSex/ LoveSounds\\" when he introduced us to his longer song length style. In this album he took it to another level and allows Timbaland to show how their collaborations are unstoppable and a true art. JT shows his musical influences throughout the entire album with an plethora of musical styles. They explore R&B, rap, indie, classical, and neo-soul. Put simply, together Timberlake and Timbaland are so amazing not only do you not mind the extended length of the tracks you wish the song would continue and it's already been 7:00 on one track. JT focuses on the entirety of the album, not just making a few hit songs to sell as singles. As a person who is still into buying cds and not just tracks I can not only appreciate his efforts I applaud and give Mr. Timberlake a standing ovation. If I was running the Grammy's JT gets album of the year for sure.<br /><br />Some of my personal favorites:<br /><br />Don't Hold the Wall: A classic Timbaland track that takes you back to the old version of himself. The production and depth of this track is just ridiculous, in the best way possible.<br /><br />Let the Groove Get In: It's got a great latin feel to it with out being too cliche. A definite party/get moving track that can transform you back into the old spanish harlem. Classic yet still complex with the production of the music.<br /><br />Blue Ocean Floor: It has an indie feel with touching lyrics and smooth baseline. Its instrumentalbeginning sets the tone for the end of the album and I'm slightly sad that I had to wait until the last track to go on the musical journey but JT proves that you save the best for last.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very very pleased with this book!  I have an older verson of WORD, and this one is set up for WORD 2007 or newer.  If you are like me and have WORD 2003, the table of contents will not be picked up when you load it into Kindle. The 2003 TOC links will work perfectly in WORD and jump to the right place like they're supposed to - in WORD - I thought it would translate, but Kindle is not WORD and none of the older TOC links will go through into your book. (This is a very important thing, worth repeating: This is for WORD 2007 or newer!) That said, I took this book into the library where they have the correct version of WORD and set up the chapters like they recommend with no trouble.  They even put in pictures of what to look for in the new WORD panel on top so you can find all the commands since WORD 2007 looks nothing like WORD 2003. They thought of everything, step by step, and trust me, that's important.  I have this weird brain that sees choices where no one else does, and this book is so clearly written that not even I could get lost. Another note: if you have WORD, there is no need to set your book up as an HTML document, Kindle can read WORD docs and you will save yourself an extra step.
0553328255|5.0|Wow, two volumes and a slipcase too. Print is a good size and great reading for not only the summer, but long winter nights also.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is not just any Film, this is an experience not to be missed.<br /><br />Please do yourself a huge favor, if you have not seen the trailer or read spoiler reviews, or if you know someone in this situation, get this movie and just watch it or buy it for that someone.<br /><br />I knew very little about Flight, saw it in the store, bought the blu-ray and was blown away!!<br /><br />The quality of the production, cast/acting, script/dialog, plot, cinematography, action, and the raw humanity of the film are all top notch. This film can be ranked up there with the best of the best, with one caveat: The subject matter of the film is raw and intense. In fact, it is the theme that makes it shine as a movie of timeless value.<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis is the producer/director of this film and you will remember him for movies like Cast Away, Forest Gump, and Back To The Future. However, this movie deals with a far more serious topic which I will not spoil in this review therefore, Flight is quite a bit more intense than his previous works. If you are a very conservative person, there may be aspects of this film that will be uncomfortable for you such as; the script/dialog is quite \\"in your face\\" as it were. With that said, you may want to read some spoilers so that you know what you are getting into, the material is not family oriented, this is not Forest Gump.<br /><br />I am convinced that if you have little or no previous knowledge about this production and you just get it and watch it, you too with be floored, as it can be a very profound experience. It is the humanity, the culture, the sociology that gives this work its power.<br /><br />Much like other movies such as The Game, The Edge, Seven Pounds, The Village, there is meaning to be gleaned from the greatness of the story. Do yourself a favor and purchase it \\"sight unseen\\" as the old saying goes and I am confident that you will not only be glad you did, you will understand exactly why I suggest this so strongly. Enjoy!!. Enjoy!!
B001C08RHA|4.0|I did the Iron Man story all out of order.  I saw Iron Man 3 without ever having watch the first two.  I bought the first one for obvious reasons and really enjoyed it.  So fun to see the Iron Man beginnings and watch him develop into the Tony Stark we all know and love.  4 stars, great movie.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Great show, nice put for characters. Shows diversity from the movies and some add on to more details event. Sadly the show got cut short as any other SciFi shows that doesn't meet the owners demand of number of viewers. There is no more of the series, season 3 got cancelled. Still the show in the first two seasons got good events with nice filming, acting and scenario. Puzzled for the third but that we will never come to know.
0060254920|3.0|I purchased this book because of all the memories I have from when I was a kid, reading it.  Unfortunately, my 2 y/o does not care for it and it doesn't hold his attention.  Maybe when he's a little older.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|[Review is for the Theatrical Version -- in IMAX!]<br /><br />** Some Spoilers **<br /><br />Into Darkness is an excellent follow-up to the 2009 film, Star Trek.<br /><br />The alternate history that J.J. Abrams writes still has a lot of the borrowed items from the original TV and movies to make the film interesting to fans, yet for those not into the \\"canon,\\" the film stands on its own as an interesting science fiction film.<br /><br />** Spoilers **<br /><br />As you may have heard by now, the Botany Bay was discovered earlier than in the original time-line and someone who knows better wants to militarize the Federation and wants to use Khan for that purpose.  Let's get a man who knows how a military mind works and use him to handle the Klingon threat.<br /><br />Quite a story!<br /><br />** End Spoilers **<br /><br />Relationships:<br /><br />The film is very character-driven.  Now this may seem at odds to you if you enjoy a film full of special effects and warp-speed ships.  Even so Kirk is the same brash self who will break the rules if it means saving a life.<br /><br />The film starts out with Kirk swiping a holy scroll from natives - white, wild natives with eyes that blink backwards  -- weird, but I digress.  And somehow we have his science officer about to blow a cold fusion bomb into a volcano and save the planet.  Yeow!  And the Enterprise having the ability to land on the surface of a planet was a new look as well.<br /><br />Some fans squawk about Spock having a relationship with Uhura. First, it's not that unheard of.  Remember in the original series with Apollo?  And second, it's done in a tasteful manner and really could have been cut out altogether!<br /><br />The primary relationship of course is the Kirk/Spock dynamic.  As in the original series, Kirk, Spock and at times McCoy really go at it.  Would have liked this to have been better scripted with more banter and some humor injected here.<br /><br />The other relation is between Khan (played coolly by Cumberbatch) and the Federation - playing on others emotions, playing them to get what he wants - fascinating character.  As Kirk, he cares about his crew - frozen and awaiting revival - and besides wanting revenge on the Federation, he wants Kirk - very dead!<br /><br />Cons:  Scotty in this film is a riot of a Scotman - but Chekov not so much.  Not all characters come off well.  Would have liked to have seen some more romance with the Carol Marcus character.  Ah, well.<br /><br />Special Effects:  See the film on the big IMAX screen.  The cost is prohibitive but the effects are well worth it.  The chase through a pink/purple Peter Maxx-like jungle, the new \\"warp speed\\" and the speed chasing with Klingon space cruisers is worth the price.<br /><br />Make-Up!:  The Klingons, must mention the Klingons.  They make a brief and exciting entrance half-way through the film as they confront a powerless shuttle containing Kirk and a few hand-picked men - who smartly took off their red shirts, LOL - and as in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, the view of Klingons have again changed.<br /><br />Music!:  The score is excellently done - the mix throughout was amazing and fit each scene well.  Alexander Courage's score is inserted where appropriate.  Stay for the end credits and listen to the coda.  Awesome stuff.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  A must-see especially for \\"Wrath of Khan\\" fans.  You'll see many similarities to an interesting story that will keep you on the edge throughout.<br /><br />Recommend:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000HZD168 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]<br />[[ASIN:B00B3736O6 Star Trek Countdown to Darkness #1 Enterprise Edition (Exclusive Variant Cover) (Star Trek: Countdown to Darkness)]]olly by Cumberbatch) and the Federation - playing on others emotions, playing them to get what he wants - fascinating character.

0064430170|5.0|My 2y/o absolutely loves this book.  We have to read it 2 or 3 times in a row when he picks this book
0307744434|4.0|Intruging story line and I loved the circus features.  The characters were interesting and added so much richness to the story...
0399226907|4.0|This is a cute book, my 2 y/o likes it.  The cardboard pages hold up well to rough handling of a little one.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Love it! Great action, great characters, loved the scenery, locations were awesome...Alfred Hitchcock is a great director and this picture proved it!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It was easy to figure out, and it works better than worrying about having paper and pen handy.  I wish I could have multiple pages available at the same time, but haven't figured out a way to do that yet.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the Gideon Cross series.  Every woman's ideal man!  The only, ONLY downside will be the long wait til the next book in the series.  The characters are all so real, and the constant action makes it impossible to put down!
1451668945|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark never fails to write an interesting story and this is no exception.  She has wonderful storylines and is a great story teller.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read mysteries.  If you are a Mary Higgins Clark fan, you will not be disappointed in this her latest.  You already know what a great lady and story teller she is.
B008220D5K|5.0|Hilarious. The humor will run deeper if you're married with children as I am. Especially if you don't take yourself too seriously to be annoyed by bickering. They fight,and it's very real in that they often fight about such ridiculous things. But their fights will have you rolling with laughter. This movie is laugh therapy for people in long relationships. Or for those who've been together long enough to be annoyed with one another! The cast was perfectly chosen - could not imagine anyone else in these roles. I highly recommend if you just need a break from the crazy life of parenting and maintaining a long relationship. Yes they swear all the time, and the inappropriate things said and done around the children are not so pushing it that you cringe - just pushing it enough to belly laugh about. My husband and I watched this together and it was a great date night movie - not romantic, not a chick flick, just funny funny funny...
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|very easy my son loves it but things shouldn't take so long to build. also wish the nector and such did t cost so much
B008Y73940|1.0|He should quick relying on his good looks and work at his craft.<br />Poor script and poorer acting, glad I didn't pay to rent this.
B00CLL1UY6|4.0|The story follows the life of Sebastian Schreiber in Vienna, Austria. He is the son of a grocery store owner and having had his leg amputated as a teenager, has to take over the responsibilities of the store and family when his father is drafted for World War I. Though kind and intelligent, Sebastian feels that as a cripple, he will never find true love. Through pre war to post war he and his family experience love, loss and triumph, making life long friends along the way.<br /><br />At first i found the book to be a bit stilted. Even though there was nothing wrong with the story or content itself, it didn't flow and i wasn't able to connect with any of the characters. After awhile it seemed to kick into gear and flowed along smoothly.<br /><br />I liked most of the characters, though their weaknesses were at times frustrating. Obviously this made it more realistic. There was one character that i did not like, however without them there wouldn't be as much of a story!<br /><br />Even though the story was slower paced, it still was a page turner and i found it hard to put it down.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book however i was actually quite disappointed in the ending. I found it to be a bit of an anticlimax. It wasn't so much the resolution of the story, it was how quickly it happened. I felt that it didn't match the rest of the book in its pace. The rest of the story is quite detailed and slower paced and it seemed to finish so abruptly.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book as it was really interesting, especially if you like historical fiction. I would even recommend it those who like family saga as it errs on that side as well.<br /><br />This review is based on a digital copy provided by the author.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Carol Channing at her best!<br /><br />ALWAYS worth watching and it will make you smile.<br /><br />Proves that you can have a fun movie without in your face sex, violence and swearing and like it!
B008HK3XYK|4.0|We confused one thing for another and shall return the product today, and appreciate the exchange policy stated in the on-line literature about &#34;How To&#34;....
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is my favorite game.<br />I love it.<br />It is awesome.<br />All so I will say I love epic the game
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|The level of detail was at times too much  for me.<br />However, overall, this is a truly beautiful story and must<br />be shared.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is very handy and easy to use.  I like using my own music/sounds for the alarm.  Naming each timer makes the app easy and fast to set up and identify timers for any occasion or use.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I think this app is a great app because my child has adhd and she can not sit still but now she is happy and that makes me very happy
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a fun game to play I love it can't stop playing it and the fun thing is you have more than one vehicle to drive
B0074PNCRM|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I have read, the love between Augustus and hazel is beautiful. It's an astounding book and only John Green could create something so wonderful.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|37signals is a great company, but this book is full of general hand-waving advice. There hasn't been much, if anything that I can use day in, day out in constructing / running my business, EXCEPT, as a software business, the advice to &#34;Keep your software simple, and keep it opinionated&#34;<br /><br />When you have an opinion, those who share your opinion will love it.  If you don't have an opinion, people don't care either way about it (when people don't care, they won't pay)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app. I know this is silly but my favorite feature is the option to customize the color of the battery.
B000000WHX|1.0|I figured if Bono is digging this then it must be good.  It is not!<br /><br />I don't understand how the influences of artists I like are so inconsistent with the artist themselves.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Autism exists on a continuum<br />Regardless of whether you suffer from autism or know someone who does it is important to recognize distinct approaches to learning and perceiving the world around you great movie and informative for everyone
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I believe too many people get wrapped up in the similarities they believe a book and movie should have with one another.  Why not enjoy each for what they are? The books were amazing, but a book flows very much in a different way then a movie will ever be able too.  A book uses your imagination to create the pictures in your head.  A movie takes these liberties and shows you how magnificent a story can be, regardless if it's exactly like the book or only touches the fine points of the book.  In the book you feel what the characters feel because the author writes it every detail, in a movie you must watch to feel the energy.  I enjoyed the movie immensely.  If you believe that books and movies are and should be a perfect match for one another, then do not watch this movie if you have read the books.  If you can keep an open mind and enjoy the movie for what it is....entertainment, then watch the movie because I believe it's a well executed story line played by quality actors who had me completely lost in the story.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the workouts! I started this DVD about 21 days ago and I am at level 3. I really do feel like my body has changed, I already purchased Ripped in 30.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Have so many it will take me awhile to read them all, great author and am looking foreard to reading this!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Have so many it will take me awhile to read them all, great author and am looking foreard to reading this!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. When I read this book I was reminded of some of the thoughts and emotions I went through when my mother died. It felt helpful to know I wasn't the only person to feel that way.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I should have read the reviews before buying and reading this book.  I agree with the other readers' assessments. This was supposed to be a trilogy. This should have been the end of the line and that's what I was looking forward to. My thinking is that Day was behind schedule in the writing of this book so the publisher took what she had and printed what truly is only a portion of what this book should be.  I was stopped in my tracks at 1 am when I turned the page (on my Kindle so I didn't know how many pages remained) and it was done, over, fini!  I was hopping mad that she betrayed her readers.<br /><br />Sex scenes are repetitious. Don't include the same interlude over and over.  All the loose ends should have been tied up, i.e. Nathan's murder, Corinne, Brett, etc. Day didn't live up to her reputation on this one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was fantastic; images were stunning and trying to figure out how to solve it was a lot of fun please hurry with the next game can't waiting too many apps of this caliber
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|definitely worth watching. The cinematography and acting is excellent. Storyline does get a bit strange, and go off on tangents at times, but I'm still looking forward to the 3rd season.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This movie was very hard to follow. It also was mildly revolting and uninteresting at the same time. I was very disappointed.
030746363X|5.0|he has some amazing things in this book. I generally buy them now as gifts for friends. Keep it up Tim.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Even though the majority of the songs are in the Babel CD, I'm not disappointed.  Be sure to get this and listen to &#34;The Boxer&#34; - fantastic rendition of Simon & Garfunkels' hit.  They put their spin on it and it was well worth buying this CD just for that song.<br />You won't regret it.<br />HamItUp
1609611543|5.0|I know this sounds like hyperbole, but it isn't.  Quite simply, read this book.  Even if you think you're healthy, read this book.  And if you have any IBS, joint pain, weird skin rashes, stuffy head, cough that won't go away, GERD, or just a stubborn, extra ten pounds that always seem to come back, read this book.  I've now bought six copies and passed them along to friends.  This is not a fad diet. The author is a cardiologist, and this is really valuable information for the quality of your life.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I just need to figure out how to delete a country.  It was near my City, State!  and I need to get rid of it!  Other than that I love it!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Such a good history, such a good time while reading it! I was totally involved with Lisbeth. I couldn't stop until finish it.
B007R21JJK|3.0|Lasted one whole week. May just have been a bad chipset. Motherboard seemed to have a lot of good features and the price was reasonable.
006224454X|4.0|This was a page turner, but when I read it I knew it had to have been written by a guy and I was right! There are parts in it rhat only a man write when referring to \\"intimate relationship.\\" Very blunt about the sex. I had to laugh. He does a great job with the heroine. Her character is well developed, but the male characters are not well elaborated on, like they're merely pieces of the plot, but I suppose there isn't much you can expand upon when the lead  is an amnesiac.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! Getting on always cheers me up. So easy to lose track of time, helps me to have a vision.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty great. I always play this game. You should really get it. They are starting world tours. They have cool powerhouse. You jump on trains and fly over tunnels!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best free game EVER. but I have to say it is hard. I am stuck on level 3 in the desert. Please help!!!!!!:-)
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved the intensity and plot. Good acting and good actors. My husband thought it was just a chick flick, but even he liked it!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game. very fun and challenging. Nice music and sound effects and the game looks great too. Keeps you thinking. Give it a try
B006E4QCXU|3.0|Its cool but i think art particle free is better. Also when i was changing the color and i wanted to go back to the regular menu it wouldnt let me. Thank you for reading i hope you found this helpful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is so much fun and the horses are really cute. I just love the app. I<br /> would play it all day if I could.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|I love this game because the best thing about the game is you can go and play with my friend
B006MXJ3V6|4.0|Realistic Accurate and compassionate expose(with an acute accent) of both issue. However, found the female student character  very frustratingly manipulative.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so addicting. you get to feed,treat,groom,muck out,and many more!:)you obviously know what feed means.Treat means you pet your horse,then feed it treats.Groom means clean,and muck out means clean its bed. Have fun!:D
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Now I have about 40 games on my kindle.this is about my favorite game besides words with friends. You have trains to complete missions,collect things that match your theme,like I'm in Miami,Flordia. I have to collect flamingos.There are many things to do in this awesome game! I highly recommend this to every kindle User out there!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox is so easy to use and so useful--and free. Everything it does, it does remarkably well.<br /><br />I downloaded this app to my Android phone after putting Dropbox on my computer, so I could share files between my phone, my computer, and my husband's computer (because he also has access to my Dropbox account). It's so easy to use! Take photos, for example. I can send a photo or group of photos to Dropbox. This lets me clear them from my phone's memory, while still giving me (and my husband) easy access to them from any of my devices. I can take photos on my phone, send them to Dropbox, delete them from my phone, get home, open my blog or Facebook or Pinterest or whatever, and post those pictures with ease. Love it!
0425263991|5.0|What an amazing story! It takes an author as talented as Nalini Singh to turn a character we have seen as frightening and immensely dangerous into a romantic hero, but she manages it ably. Kaleb Krychek has been searching for Sahara for seven years. She was kidnapped at the instigation of his \\"mentor\\" Santano Enrique and used as a lever to keep Kaleb subservient to Enrique. When the story begins, he has found her and found her badly damaged.<br /><br />Sahara Kyriakus had been tortured over and over again in an attempt to get her to use her very unique and powerful telepathic gift. She managed to escape by creating a labyrinth in her own mind to protect herself. She is a person of great strength and great integrity. She is also in love with Kaleb. They have known each other since she was seven and he was 13. She makes herself into his only friend and his lifeline to his humanity. The flashbacks to their childhoods helps convert the Kaleb we've seen into a sympathetic character.<br /><br />As the two get to know each other again, the outside world isn't taking a backseat. Pure Psy is stepping up its efforts to \\"purify\\" the Psy no matter how many acts of terrorism it will take. The Council has disintegrated and fallen apart and Kaleb is getting ready to take control of the PsyNet before Pure Psy or the flaws within the net manage to destroy it.<br /><br />The climactic battle with Pure Psy sees a coalition of humans, changelings and Psy and reunite many of our favorite characters from earlier books in the series as all factions need to work together to keep Pure Psy's chaos from coming to pass.<br /><br />The story is filled with intense emotion and great action scenes. The emotional intensity between Kaleb and Sahara was breath-taking and heart-breaking. I strongly recommend this episode in the Psy-Changeling series.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a very strong work. It is bound to be useful for anyone interested in understanding his or her own behavior. Duhigg's ideas about habit formation and habit change are &#34;spot on.&#34; Smart, intelligent, knowledgeable, and accessible.
B0081336FO|5.0|Fresh and new yet keeps Doyles basics always at the core.<br />Great story telling while keeping the spirit of the books.
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance. Fabulous song. Never goes out of style. Smooth. Van Morris is excellant. I listen to this all the time.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This little app performed exactly as advertised.  It's quick and easy to use and provides a good reminder of battery status in a cool graphic.  Well done!<br /><br />David
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the honesty and accuracy with early 20th century aristocratic life.  Great character development.<br />Jullian, do NOT turn this into a 21st century political piece on gay house servants.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It's a decent software program for picture editing. Could be a bit better but if all you have is basic crop/rotate software this is definitely a step up.
B008RF0M9O|5.0|I was initially skeptical about the product. Almost every other seller I looked into was selling each ear pad separately. I didn't see in the listing if this was for a single pad or both. So, I shot a quick email to the seller asking for clarification. They got back to me in under 24 hours that it was indeed for BOTH ear pads! I was stoked to say the least. Such a low price for a pair? Heck YEAH! So I placed the order and in about a week they arrived all the way from mainland China. So far, so good. I busted out my Sony MDR-7506 Studio Monitor headphones and removed the old, tearing ear pads. The first thing I noticed was that these replacements felt, looked and are in fact ever so slightly smaller than the stock pads. I started getting a little worried, but I continued none the less. It took me a little while to finesse them on, and once I did, it was obvious that the were just a tad smaller. HOWEVER.... after a day on the cans, they have stretched to better fit, they are nice and snug, not sliding around like the stock pads were want to do. The only REAL difference is that they do not have the foam padding that goes over the actual speaker part of the headphone like the stock pads do, but I noticed no difference in sound quality or comfort. I am EXTREMELY happy with this product and the seller as well.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Let me first start out by saying that I absolutely love pretty much any mafia movie! This one, in my opinion, is one of the best mafia movies because it was happening while I was alive! It just amazes me how much these guys get a free pass from jail by squealing on other people While they themselves were committing such heinous crimes. All of the major characters in this movie work really well together. You should put this movie on your must-see list.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my daughter loves this game!! she plays it all the time. she even helps her little brother play it!! wich is a relif cuz they are usually fighting!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|What else needs to be said? This book is great, hopefully the movie will compel a new generation to pick this book up and give it a go.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I did find the beginning of this book a little slow and tedious to get through,  but about a third of the way through there was a lot more action.  More twists and turns for Sookie and I look forward to the next addtion
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Great read. It will inspire you to get off the coach and go running. I really appreciated the recipes that were included.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app is great so far I have only scratched the surface of it and am having a blast. tots! to the makers of this games! usually jigsaw puzzles on these things are boring and too easy, others are hard to manipulate the pieces or u cant really see the pieces. this game is just right you have tons of pic to chose from or you can make your own. you can choose if the pieces rotate or not. for me it is just fun. while I'm stuck recuperating. good fun.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|This movie, when it came out, was so underrated!  So much so, that it was re-released to audiences, thinking that maybe they took a collective vacation when it came out!  Great movie, great action, great stars!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|All that I didn't understand the meaning of in the show became crystal clear....can't wait to read the next book!<br />Thanks
B000GWE44U|5.0|This is the ultimate in psychological and physical horror.  Not a slasher, yet bloody enough for the slasher fan in all of us.  What more can be said of this classic movie?
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is really fun but I've noticed it lacks for the kindle fire device. This is because of bugs reported by kindle fire users only such as our LAN servers do not show. What doesn't help either is that we get updates much later and I don't even know if 0.7.1 will even be available at all.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Make this one of the most endearing, amusing and dramatic show on televsion. The scripts are well written and the supporting<br />caste very good.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|The picture does not do the color justice. It really is a beautiful pink. It is squishy so it works very well for protecting a Kindle.
1589795474|5.0|This is an very inspiring book for all ages.  A must read for the progressive person, or anyone who just want to know about the facts of life!!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Have loved them for day one and would buy anything they put out there.And I send them to my son and best friend
1612680011|5.0|This is a great read for learning what you really should have learned in grade school.  This book is such a master piece that all public libraries in the Seattle area had them all checked out.  What's really profound about that is that there was a back log for this book and The Millionaire Next Door for months and months.
B003YUNEYC|3.0|I like the quality and attention to detail of these shoes.  They have a great look and are comfortable...almost.  I'm a guy and wear a size 10, pretty square in the middle of a size 10.  These Crocs are just too small, the molded foot bed curves back over the toes slightly which causes the shoe to fit too snug and small for my toes.  Again I have average to slim build and my toes are not huge and chubby but these shoes just feel like they could use another 1/2 size.  I believe the same is being said in other reviews that I should have paid attention to.  If I had purchased a size up (I recommend) I would probably wear these everyday and everywhere.  Buy size up, Crocs tried to hard to make the unisex thing work here and ended up not quite getting it right.
B0089MXRII|3.0|In Twelve Months of a Soviet Childhood: Short Stories, Julia Gousseva has written twelve captivating tales that capture a slice of life in the now-defunct Soviet Union. She begins with winter, the dreariest, yet the most colorful month in Moscow, with its New Year's parties and colorful New Year trees. She then takes us, month by month, on a journey that she calls fictional, but must be in large part autobiographical. We see things through the eyes of a child, unvarnished and without adult filtering.<br />A captivating collection of tales, as I said; but, the book has some near-fatal flaws. First, the sans serif text is a bit on the difficult side to read. But, the ragged and inconsistent indentation of paragraphs is by far the most distracting. This is a potentially great collection of short fiction that could reach that greatness with a bit of judicious editing.<br />I'd love to give it four or five stars, but alas, the formatting flaws drop it down to really two and a half.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|NOT TOO EASY BUT NOT TOO HARD. HAVE BOUGHT ALOT OF THESE GAMES AND THIS BY FAR IS BETTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS. GOTTA GET BACK!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hi I'm Andy and I'm 4. I like angry birds because it's fighting and crashing and shooting. I like  the toons a lot. I always asking my big sis, emy if there's a new one. I pretend to be angry birds with my three year old brother. I'm even going to have angry birds b day party. I think it's the best app in the whole wide world.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For anyone who hasn't yet watched any of the Downton Abbey shows, it's about the wealthy upper class back in the early 1900's and how they lived along with their servants, who all knew their place and never over stepped their boundaries.. If they did, they were let go.. It's fascinating to see how people used to live and the roles people played. It certainly was a different world back then.. So formal!<br /><br />Once I watched Season 1 (on Netflix), I was hooked and had to keep watching. However, Netflix and Redbox do not offer seasons 2 and 3.. I purchased them on Amazon Prime Video.. I haven't had any problems watching it at all. Amazon's streaming works flawlessly.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Well this.game is pretty good and a great time passer.<br />  But I don't like that it don't give u instructions.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America is one in a series of movies about the Avengers.  I enjoyed all of the movies plus the movie about the Avengers.  I plan to see the other Iron Man movies and the upcoming Thor movie.  I highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys adventure movies.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A few years ago we saw Avatar at the Cinema in 2D. It was good, but nothing in comparison to watching this DVD at home. It seemed like a completely new film. There were so many nuiances that we saw in the 3D Version. Wow!
B001GM28HO|3.0|I received it in a timely manner and in new condition.  I'm not a big Lady Gaga fan so I really can't judge the cd.  I bought it for a Christmas present.  It was on a Christmas wish list.  If you are a Lady Gaga fan, I'm sure you would enjoy it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I'm seriously debating adding HBO to my service package just so I can watch GOT as it airs. Best show I've seen in a long time.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved Lord of the Rings but it's a tough act to follow. Even though this movie is similar in many ways it still has great movie effects, great acting and a good story line. It was worth the money I spent on it.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Love it, don't have to turn on the bed lamp to get up at night, if I'm reading my<br />Kindle Fire - just turn on the Flashlight App
B00AFEY354|5.0|One of the best movies Ive seen. They did such a fantastic job adapting it from the book, obviously not everything is exactly the same but they keep the feel of it very simillar to the book. I watched it right after reading it and I felt very good about the way they adapted it to film. So glad I bought it. The DVD menu is really cute too! Simple and cute. There arent a whole lot of special features or anything.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  There are so few available that are squeaky clean enough to offer in a movie night at church - one that appeals to all ages, too.  In addition to movie night viewing, film clips have been used in morning worship to illustrate a point.
B00C061HZY|5.0|I think every Daft Punk album comes with some sense of controversy (just look at original reviews of all their albums). Yeah, now looking back, everyone calls their music legendary, but it wasn't the case originally.  That's how I feel here.  I know in 10 years, the haters will get it.<br /><br />First, they didn't aim to really &#34;create something&#34; new.  I think they have always been obsessed with capturing the essence of the funky disco grooves of the late 70's through sampling.  Well, here their dreams come full circle in that they were able to hire the best in the game for that genre (look at the personnel on the album).<br /><br />So, in an era where electronic music is the &#34;rock&#34; of today, sounds are great, but the songs just aren't lasting.  Daft Punk answered the calling and gave us some GREAT music.  That's all. They felt that there was a vacuum and they needed to fill it.  There's tons of room for innovative electronic music, and tons of artists doing it.  Let the young cats do that.  I personally think the these tunes will be the basis for heavy sampling in EDM for years to come.<br /><br />Check it out!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I totally enjoy anything and everything ever performed by The Piano Guys.  The addition of the DVD with this recording was a great idea.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|it was very interesting<br />it met all our expectactions<br />we recomend it for every one<br />thanks in at advancee for thos recomendation
014241493X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. John Green is one of my favorite authors, and this, in my opinion, was his best book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series so far. But the ending of this book is killing me. I can't wait for the next book to come out. Hopefully it will be soon.
0142410705|4.0|Not my favorite John Green book (Paper Towns is) but I still really liked it. Much more light-hearted than the other books of his that I have read so far.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's easy to collect gems it has cut ponies and it has great graphics.I am enjoying this game a hole lot.I hope you like it to. And it's just something to do when I'm board.you should try it if you don't.all in its a great game.
0525478817|5.0|This book was great. John Green has quickly become one of my favorite authors. To anyone looking for books of his to read, I'd definitely recommend this.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A little too much introspection for my taste.  Also, didn't find our &#34;hero&#34; such a &#34;Golden Boy&#34;.  Calculating victim too.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Very well written episode. I was glad to see agent Reed in such an emotional<br /> State. Sometimes he can seem a bit wooden  although that's how some really smart people behave. I loved this.
0618918248|4.0|There are two ways to read this book in my opinion.  You could look at this read as an organized refutation of god and religion, hitting many dimensions of the matter.  Or you could make this your own atheism bible and become so faithful that the irony kills you.<br /><br />I'm an open minded non theist, but can appreciate merit in religion too.  I appreciate that there is a text that articulates the position of atheism, and does it well.  Logic, science, and lots of history are woven together to argue not only that god is not real, but he's not a good thing either.<br /><br />That said, the supernatural realm cannot by penetrated by logic, science, and lots of history.  The concept of a god is unfalsifiable because it's above our judgement.  The Great Prayer Experiment was a waste of time and ink.<br /><br />This book has great points about how religious ideas can be or have been abused, and the negative externalities that arise, but it takes faith to be 100% certain there is no god either (the chapter IS called \\"Why there is almost certainly no god\\").  A balanced individual will take the time to read this book, but also read religious text and ideas to get a more proportional idea of what to think.  If you are a fundamentalist or a 10000% atheist, then this doesn't apply to you.  The extremes inform the middle.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|this is what it is about!the original mixes of my fav zztop albums!i have this for the rest of my life
B002CIMKHO|1.0|We love the movie but it was choppy and to stop and start 3 times.  We have cable Internet and new hardware in the house.  I also have Apple TV and do not have a problem streaming from there.
B000SEI230|5.0|I cried.  It was a quick easy read.  Very predictable but that never took anything away from the story.  It was actually good, if my heart is going to be shredded I like to see it coming.
1607066017|5.0|Fiona Staples does an excellent job illustrating beautiful landscapes and interesting characters. Brian Vaughan keeps the story interesting with great pacing. I would recommend this comic to any fan of the genre. I am anxiously awaiting volume 2.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, mas what the hell was Sylvia thinking? What part of \\"trilogy\\" she didn't understood? It wasn't worth the waiting... I was truly disappointed!!
0425263991|5.0|Actually this was the best book I've read so far. Loved it amazing.I recommend this book. I could not stop reading.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|' just love this flash unit!!  It looks like it was &#34;Born&#34; to go with my D3100 body.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't make coffee in the morning.  Seriously, It competes with my SB-600. The &#34;400&#34; is just so much handyer than the 600 that the lower power flash is hardly noticed and hasn't contributed to any lost shots.<br />I don't think I would use it for a wedding shoot, but I may someday when I learn all the finer points of the unit.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Starts out ok but takes forever with out spending real money. You can beat it without. spending cash but all the good stuff will cost cash.
0062238868|4.0|By now everyone is aware of Kyle's remarkable career as an accomplished sniper and his untimely and almost ironic death. There is also the fascination with the Navy Seal program and its particular form of warrior mentality. Kyle certainly personified this breed of soldier, so it is worthwhile to examine the life of a person on whom we are dependent as a nation at war but also towards whom some are ambivalent. In other words, we cheer when they take out Bin Laden but choose not to contemplate the down and dirty work they do in the performance of their dangerous duties.<br /><br />This book exposes all that. Here is a person driven by a love of country and an eagerness to engage in combat, the fiercer the better. To Kyle there are no gray areas, but only stark black and white choices, as he has no compunction in applying deadly force. He has no political or philosophical interest in the foreign policy reasons for the Iraq war or for the responsible politicians. Generals and commanding officers are viewed as obstacles to any effective strategy. His single minded purpose -and this is what I took away from his story - is to kill the enemy before they have a chance to kill one of his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />No matter where you are on the pacifist to hawk continuum, this book is  a valuable testimony to the indispensable people to whom we don't give enough recognition for the unique skills they apply on a day to day basis.
0062238868|5.0|I purchased this book for a friend and he informed me that it the book was true to form adn well written.  Character is true to form.  He is a Deputy and really reading the book.
B004USRLRS|5.0|I think that of the three who made up CSN Graham Nash was the most versatile and talented - this album proves it.<br />Although it is 40 years old it is still refreshing today due mainly to the variety of songs on show. The lyrics are a bit bland  on a couple of songs but the music is suberb overall.<br />Strange to think he was thought of as the weak link in the chain - he was certainly never than in my book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What could be better than watching the lives in this family? So well done, so engaging. Can't wait for season four.
B004USRKX8|3.0|Bought this one because of all the good reviews it received from other Amazon buyers - I must be getting old (well I am 62) but I found this album disappointing - the voice could hardly be heard above the music and at times was incoherent (was he on something at the time).<br />Compared to the debut albums of Graham Nash and Stephen Stills, which were suberb, this rates a definite 3rd in the ranking.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I just don't like the texture and I lost my  favorite world so bye bye minecraft pe<br />Also I did not  update it did it randomly
0425263924|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end... I still want to smack Gideon's mother upside the head. Here is to hoping the next comes out this year!
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|Great actors in this movie.  Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly whats not to like? Basic love triangle,  I would recommewnd it to all.
0307346617|5.0|Too many zombie tales are told from isolated survivors perspectives never really capturing the grand scope of apocalypse. 'World War Z' through its format, weaves together a chilling story of humanities ultimate survival against the undead. Give it a try, you won't be dissappointed.
0330457128|5.0|John Scalzi continues in his Old Man's  War series with The Last Colony.<br /><br />Our main characters are John Perry (ex Colonial Defense Forces soldier) , Jane Sagan (ex Colonial Defense Soldier) and their adopted daughter Zoe (whose real Dad tried to kill humanity).<br /><br />John and Jane have been chosen to lead 2500 citizens to form a colony on the planet  Roanoke. It is uninhabited and with a little work can support humans.<br /><br />But the universe is a tough place and habitable planets are in demand by many different races. What's different about Roanoke is that it is unknown by most and to ensure that,  the colonists will never be able to return.<br /><br />Once they reach the planet they discover that there is a deeper political twist to the colonization. Apparently a group of 412 different cultures have banded together, calling themselves the Covenant,  and declared that there will be no more human colonies established and are willing to back up that statement with the destruction of any new colonies that are established.<br /><br />Scalzi again develops characters that you can relate to and care about. Multiple story arcs collide and meet at opportune times, and the whole story is compelling and enjoyable to the reader,<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended along with the other books i the series: Old Man's War; The Ghost Brigades; The Android's Dreams; and Zoes Tale.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game its so addicting. The first time i played i said this is the best game ive ever played.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This is not Pulitzer Prize winning fiction.  It's not meant to be!  For a fun summer read, it worked for me. I am really not that offended about the addition of more books to the series; I will enjoy the additional opportunity for a smutty, mindless diversion from real life!  Why not?
B009RH9FR6|1.0|The Marware Revolve Leather ad for the Kindle Fire HD looked like a very good case. When I received the actual case, it was a big disappointment! It is heavy, cumbersome and awkward to use. I wanted and would prefer something in leather and lightweight to protect my Kindle. I order from Amazon frequently and am very unhappy with this purchase! I might give it one star because it's leather. If you want a light-weight case to protect your Kindle, to be able to easily carry it with you for use other than a home, to be able to slip it in your purse, I do not recommend this case. I do not use it and it was a waste of money.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|Basically this is one of the most accurate and well done adaptations of a graphic novel.  It is important to realize that this is just one part in a two part story so you don't get frustrated with &#34;the ending&#34;.  Concept is great.  Animation was great for now days hand drawing and the casting of voices was also very good.<br /><br />So, the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars?  The only reason I can't fully recommend it is because of violence.  The  Violence aspect IS close to the graphic novel, I guess it just went over my limit.  Sometimes reading is easier to take than watching (especially for an old guy like me).
B00785P2QC|5.0|I cant believe I can make my own city. this is a game I like a lot. no game is close to the fun I had
B00B7FXYJG|3.0|This review is mainly to give other old school folks like me a heads up (especially if you have never read the graphic novel).<br /><br />Great concept and one of the best executions of a book to film.<br /><br />So, the reason for 3 instead of 5 stars?  The only reason I can't fully recommend it is because of violence and topless lady (w/ other sexuality).  Now, I realize it was very close to the graphic novel, but there seemed to be an extra long time focusing on the lady without a top.  I can only take strategically placed arms and guns over breasts for so long, and it just seemed to go on and on.  Even the scene with the Senator seemed more vulgar (I admit they may not have been, but when something becomes moving it seems more intense and thus, more vulgar).  The  Violence aspect was also close to the graphic novel, but again animating it with all the people being shot was just too much for me.  I am glad I watched it on Amazon and did not buy it.  It was worth watching once.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story, I haven't slept in days because I can't put it down =_= Loved it <3 I can't wait to read the next two!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've been waiting for this book to come out and was so excited for it's release! I downloaded it on the day of release and tore through it! This Crossfire book is as good if not better than the first two. The plot thickens - the steamy scenes are steamier - I can't wait to see where Sylvia goes next.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Having to start back at the beginning of the course after EVERY crash makes the game too repetitious.  Would prefer an option to start at select points to learn how to get thru certain terrain.  No points should be award for these re-dos.
B0018AZWTA|5.0|The most underrated yes album. The musicianship is very strong, and the songs are great.  Also another great album cover by roger dean.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really never knew I would get so involved in a show and look forward to the next.  It was creepy but captivating.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|these games are my favorite. they last a good amount of time and have good puzzles too. I hope they keep making more.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is one of the best James Bond.  My son really enjoyed watching this with me.  He is nine years old and it is age appropriate for the most part.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|You will be more for reading night circus· Find the time it won't take long at all· I now have many inspired projects to create·
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I thought this game was really cool. It is a bit tedious with all the walking you have to do to get any where. I think it would be nice for there to be a basic map, something to show the player how big the place is, and gets more detailed as you explore. I also don`t like how short the demo is. I feel like the demo needs to be longer than the day in the game that it is. I feel that one in game day is not enough to get a true feel for what the full game is like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game really helped me with my skills! I love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves horses!
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|cd contained songs I remembered very classical<br />Duets made you think they always sang these songs together<br />recommed for anyone over 50
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I liked this book but some of the words r hard for me to under stand I recommend this book to Olivia Keeley
B00ATP24NW|5.0|It's a really great album with the extra songs that you hear when at their concerts. I absolutely love it
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game was a good way to entertain yourself for a while. But I don't think it's something you can play for hours on end. It's just something to do have fun for a good ten or twenty minutes. One of the cons is that the game should have had more words in its database. But overall this is very well worth the price and is a great way to kill time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. it is my fav one! when is the new update though? its available for apple and aneroid products ready! I want an update!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love this game!!! It challenged me and I would take a break then come back and I beat it. My brain feels tired but this game helps keep my brain sharp
030758836X|1.0|The charaters in this book have absolutley no redeeming qualities. They are a miserable couple that deserved each other.  After reading her book I would never read another one.  But if you want to be depressed go ahead and read it.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|So I was a little late picking this one up, but I'm glad I did. I buy my CD's in spurts, normally getting like 4 or 5 at a time, and this is the one that I can't stop listening to out of this last group. I guess it takes a certain taste to appreciate, but I love it. There's a good flow to the album, classic Trent Reznor as far as creating a pace/theme for is music. Highly recommended. Oh, and NIN is ofifcially back!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Too bad that it had to end. Brandon Sanderson did such a good job of completing the series that it was hard to tell where he was doing the writing. KUDOS!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|Good it comes in handy altho I us my hand most of the time. I do need it when typing so that's handy.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|use it all the times but sometimes updates screw it up. one day it's great the next there are glitches
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I would highly recommend this CD for anyone that enjoys truly great music.  I am an instant fan of IZ.  I am truly saddened that he isn't around anymore.  He is tho, with his music.  What a brilliant singer and musician!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is starting to become old news. Too many updates and too much advertising now. Since when did it become like Myspace? Like the old FB way better. But the app works just fine
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|it is an awesome game. on some of the planes it is really hard to control but I really like that. one feature I really hoped the had is multiplayer. but other than that it is a really fun game
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Love the product! Would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who is looking for quality and value.  Very pleased. Thanks!
0307744434|3.0|The world in this is fantastic. The visuals are amazing and original. The characters are pretty impressive as well. There's a great idea for the plot, with the magicians fighting through their students, who fall in love. But so many things are never explained, and while there is a climax, it has a definite deus-ex-machina quality and feels like a desperate flail. The book needed publishing, but I wish the editor had pushed harder to make the ending live up to the rest. I wish some of the questions raised had been answered. I won't go into detail because there'd be spoilers.<br /><br />I'm still glad I own it and it's still worth reading, for the originality of the visuals alone, but don't expect much in terms of plot. Someone capable of inventing such a gorgeous world could have been coaxed a little further to come up with a resolution suiting the rest of it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I think that this book is Mitch Alboms best book yet. I love the story of how Father Time got started and how it relates to religion. I love that Albom always ties in religion to his books. Awesome read!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Big fan of Hoffman and Streep.  They are great together, and I personally enjoy media which makes one think seriously about organized religion.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|I'm still not sure how I feel about this movie. There were some very distubing parts. I enjoyed following the different stories at different times, but I thought there would be more about the connections between lives and the growth of a soul.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.  However, compared to the 25th Anniversary stage production at Royal Albert Hall (on DVD), this was just okay.  There were times that I almost turned it off because it paled so in comparison.  I was actually rooting for Anne Hathaway's character (Fontaine) to go ahead and die so we wouldn't have to watch any more of her.
B004V50V9A|5.0|First off, VERY nice App!<br />Grabs your cover art, easily searches your Libraries.  In fact, you can search at least 6 different ways in pretty much every category.<br />Auto launches WMC on entry to the App, nice easy interface, and populates data VERY quickly.  Easy as heck to find and select your movies, music, tv shows, etc and punch play, or add to play list and the like.<br /><br />Easy to use WMC remote function as well, but would be nice to have auto launch on this as an option once playback of a movie or show starts.  Does automatically provide basic controls on the top and bottom of your device for volume, play/pause, and stop however.<br /><br />One main limitation of this app as well as others:  If you are using a plugin program like Cyberlink for WMC to play Bluray, you will not have control over the newly launched program.  If a tab could be added for mouse control like the remote function, problem would be solved!<br /><br />From other reviews, developer seems to be pretty responsive, so will drop a line and see where it goes on this last bit.<br /><br />All in All, great APP that has me seriously thinking about picking up a Galaxy Tab so I can add IR control and be done with remotes in the traditional sense for good!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series.  I love Gideon and Eva together.  There are so many things happening in this book that it will be interesting to see how it all pans out.  I just really hope that the author doesn't break the couple up again.  I hope there is a release date soon for the fourth book.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Really enjoying the simplicity of this App.  Neat combination of &#34;Lifeforce&#34; and Asteroids, nice soundtrack, and addicting as a result!
B008YZ4RR0|4.0|In the ongoing series of Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone, this is one of the better ones for those who appreciate the series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very engaging book and although long was a very quick and good read. I would highly recommend reading this book.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|This is a good film, all in all, if the producers or screenwriters hadn't attempted to keep winking toward what they see (or saw, no longer relevant) as the situations relationship to Guantanamo. Otherwise a fine film where McAvoy especially shines.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Worth watching for the historical significance alone, but also entertaining.  Would not have been worth the cost of going to the cinema to see it though.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Don't suspect you'll understand all of the story that unfolds in this film, some of it merely in flashes, not to say the sequences of imagery, because you're not expected to; Malick attempts to illustrate the majesty and inscrutability, beyond the limits of any human understanding, of God. This is Brad Pitt's next-best performance after &#34;Moneyball,&#34; a non-inscrutable contrast to the walk-through of Sean Penn, whose face is taking on the unloveliness of his interior world.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Excellent documentary, well-structured and engaging, with an inspiring story full of plausible and likable characters. Highly recommended for fans of good music and thoughtful people.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It is pretty basic information but it is good to have it written out so that you can remind yourself.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|The book is a very easy read. I don't think it unveiled anything truly groundbreaking but it was cleverly written and crafted in a way that was somewhat revolutionary. For me, it brought to light and touched on things that I've never talked about. This book forced me to ask questions of myself and my subconscious, and helped me become more aware of my thoughts and actions. I think this book is a must read for all women.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|One of Cruises best movies to date. Great plot and story, easy to follow and yet still rewarding to follow through.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|If you like strong vocals and guitar you need to give this CD a listen. Came a few days ago and I have played it half a dozen times.<br />Beth Hart's vocals are amazing and matched with Bonamassa..well as the CD title states..don't explain. Buy this and you will not be disappointed.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I was looking for something that plays all sorts of video formats like AVI, MKV, and the sorts. When I got this app, it didn't play the videos at all. I uninstalled this and got MX Player instead.<br /><br />So if you are looking for something that plays things other then MP4, this app is NOT for you.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Much better than I expected, and my ears are much older than last listen. Sound systems have improved remarkably also.
B00C70FG2S|5.0|It's Dark Tranquillity. If you're unsure about buying this album I have one thing for you to do..<br /><br />Punch yourself in the face and then click the \\"add to cart\\" button.<br /><br />Every. Single. Song. Excellence.<br /><br />This album does not disappoint, it's still very much DT - but it's new DT. Fabulous new DT.<br /><br />That is all.<br /><br />Do it.
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I read the reviews prior to watching it and nearly heeded the dings that it recieved. I like the cast and tend to think that these professionals can take a poor storyline (which it was not) and make something of it. I think that the problems that turned some of the previous reviewers off are the subtleties of the first part and the shift into the second part where much of the action and resolution occurs. It does take some patience and &#34;letting go&#34; as the viewer watches the first part. It is a movie I would watch again and probably appreciate more with more working context.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I always love everything Lady A puts out there but this one is really fantastic. There is a great variety of songs, different tempos, upbeat ones, ballads, the way Charles and Hillary use their voices alone and together is amazing. The differnt stories or words in the songs all vary so much too but all have great meaning for both the younger and older crowd, at least I think so. The music played by Dave is phenomenal,as always. Each CD just keeps getting better and better. It's obvious since you keep winning awards. I am so glad I have this CD and really don't think I have ever heard one song I didn't like on any CD. Kudos to you guys for another job well done---keep them coming. I know you will be taking time off soon and you will be missed but you deserve it and I know you will continue to write great songs and need some down time and time with the family. Can't wait to hear what you turn out next. Hillary best of luck for a quick and safe delivery and a healthy baby. If you need a nurse, I used to be an L&D nurse for quite a few years and worked with preemies and regular newborns so if you need a sitter, I'm all yours-----lol! Again, God Bless and remember to relax but an epidural can be a good thing too---ha,ha!!!! I know, went through it 3 times myself. You will do fine. Will keep you in my prayers. Just think of the great songs this baby will inspire you to write------if she hasn't done so already! :-)<br />Hope you come back to the New Jersey area when you,re back to touring again. Saw you at RCMH in NYC in May 2012, could have listened to you all night.<br />Love ya,<br />Barbara
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the Show on HBO so thats how I was driven to this tale. This book with not spoiling anything wasa little slow when compared to book three. Still good read just was let down a little but I still love it.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great show. Full of smart legal senses and funny one liners. A tough love relationship between colleagues and the big shot at a new life for one of them. The cast is amazing and I wouldn't have it any other way. A good show to just sit, relax and watch. Good for people with young kids too because (so far) there is no nudity or crude language you don't want your kids to hear.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Free is great and it does what it does it is suppose to do. Oh did I mention it is for free.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|i like thiis game which i had been playing on my laptop.  It is a challenge to make the matches.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This is a cute game.  For the price it is worth downloading even if you only use it as a time-waster.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I could learn many aspects of their lives when the story was wrttien.<br />And, the episodes of all the little women are truly fun and inspiring.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I ordered this after overhearing part of an episode of the TV series, which sounded like a great drama.  I was right!  This IS a great drama, and every subsequent novel manages to maintain the suspense and intrigue begun in the previous one.  I teach high school English and cannot wait to introduce this series to my students.  I think they will love them!  I am only on the fourth novel, and I simply cannot put them down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said (ie, the book is beyond awesome) - I just want to do my part in helping \\"Hunger Games\\" achieve the rating it deserves by giving it 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Monetary pocket edition sucks it won't let me update it so I can't play the game with my brother because he updated and he can't play with me because I am not updated it totally sucks I advise you to not get the game unless you have something other then a kindle fire but if you don't have a kindle fire you should totally get the game it rocks
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Tommy Lee Jones is a cowboy and does well in westerns.  This was the worst I have watched him in.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A worthwhile read.  The non traditional Stephen king fans will enjoy this book.  I couldn't put the book down.  The Dallas Texas angle is fascinating!
0817439390|5.0|Amazingly helpful! In very plain language, Bryan Peterson manages to break down the basics of the exposure triangle and then some. Helped me out tons.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|I hate it when the trailer makes the movie look like something other than what the movie really is.  This movie was okay, nothing special.  Pretty hokey effects and pedestrian storytelling.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Even though this game was fun I did get frustrated a couple of times like when I was playing a search game I would have to click several times on the same object before it would register but other then that it was pretty fun.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Despicable Me is a great movie.  My kids love it, and so do I.  Comedy, action, and drama.  Everything a good story should have.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|GREAT book! Good perspective on developments in the 20th century. Must read these books in proper order. New perspectives on the reasons for WWII from Japan and German and Russian, as well as American British. Characters were real and earthy.
1452110581|5.0|This is a really neat little book and makes a great gift for any cat lover. Beyond the cover which sell it at the get-go, the contents back the sell 100%!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book that dispels much of the propaganda in the history books about this war. The role played by Russia in this war is well represented
B001NA6096|5.0|Before Sunrise was a great movie, I really loved it. The dialog is intelligent, the chemistry of the characters is perfect, and even though it's an older film you really don't notice, it's classic and timeless.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book gives you a lot of insight into this time period and how wars were fought (humans were very expendable) in that period (as well as the mind set of the aristocracy at that time).
B008Y212PI|5.0|i love this puzzle app! there are so many different  levels and its a great way to pass the time
0439023513|5.0|Every time I've ordered a book, it always arrives 5-7 days early which is great.<br /><br />I thought this book was an excellent conclusion to the trilogy, although I was sort of disappointed to be done with it. Collins writes so well and it's so easy to get lost inside the world of the Hunger Games and all that it's about. Just when I thought something would happen, an entirely different scenario unfolded. I really couldn't put it down. I finished it within a few days, although I was sad to be done with the series, the conclusion was enticing, open-ended (allowing the reader to speculate on 'what if') and brought the story full-circle in a very non circular way.<br /><br />I really love the distinct phases Katniss goes through in all three, from a young girl in the Seam to a tribute, to a victor, to a full-blown rebel. Excellent series for anyone interested in sci-fi/dystopian literature.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Loved Hugh Jackman as the Easter bunny. Thought this had a decent story line and fun characters. I especially liked the character Sandy.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Since downloading this app, l have discovered that the battery state and remaining charging time to be SPOT-ON. but I would like to see the battery state in the banner, so that I don't have to open the app to<br /> get this info.
B00CHILW64|5.0|The acting in this movie was amazing. I felt like I was on the edge of my seat during the tsunami part. The special effects seemed so real, like you were actually watching the real story unfold.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|BBC America cuts the show up.. I have no idea why.. but they do.<br />Netflix is a crap shoot when it comes to do they have ALL the episodes streaming? OR do you have to have DVD's by mail for the last two or three discs? They keep messing up and you seem to have your act together.<br />Thank you for offering us another choice. I'm a very satisfied customer and I hope you are very successful.<br />Todd in Southern California
B003ELKNH2|5.0|I watched this movie long time ago, i was looking for it i could not find it any where thanks to amazon, i got it and i give it to my friend to watch it too and they love it.<br /><br />Thank you<br />Obaid
0307346617|5.0|This book was excellent and is great for the zombie Apocalypse! I am excited for that! cant wait for the movie even though it will not really be based on the book since the book is a bunch of journal entries
0767817486|5.0|I watched this movie in the past, i wanted to watch it again i enjoyed it very much some movies you want to watch again and gain.<br /><br />Thank you guys<br />Obaid
1400049628|5.0|This book was excellent and is great for just basic survival as well as for the zombie Apocalypse! I am excited for that!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I waited so long for this book to come out and with the first 2 books in this series I wasn't able to put them down and stayed up to the early hours of the next morning to finish off those books but with the 3rd book I read a little bit and then put it down to read the next day and I was a little confused with all the added drama and if it was needed. I was disappointed when I read the last line and turned the page only to find the book had ended. But in saying all of that I will still be buying the next 2 books to see how things work out and because I love Gideon.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I like that it's based on patterns. I like the theme and it's simple to figure out how it works!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game is alright:) Pretty addicting.But imagine this you're on the very last level,right.Then your whole kindle fire shuts down,you get charged $15 dollars for playing for over an hour.Then you have to start all over again!That happened to me:(
B00992CF6W|5.0|The Realms wont let me loving in. I love the game. slow updates. app comes out with updates faster. Awesome game play. wish it was an infanite world though
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so awesome that we have it on every single system in the house. I have my kindle here,3 P.S.3's ,one of which is my sisters.This game is really awesome and it never causes glitches or makes my kindle freeze.You have missions to complete and everytime you solve on you get how many stars were on that mission.If you're one who just wants to kick up their feet and play,download this game.I highly recommend it for you !:)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great trilogy. Was sorry that it ended. Love the way she writes .I would highly recommend the series.
0312944926|2.0|As some have noted, this is an earlier Dan Brown work and it shows.  I don't know enough about computers and cryptography to comment on those parts.  I just took them at face value.  My interest is the story and how well it's told.  My sense is that, when he wrote this, Mr. Brown was still developing as a story-teller (and he might say today that he still is).  On the other hand, it's rather timely at this juncture when a former contract employee of the NSA has just revealed some of the extent of US government data-gathering.  Life is imitating art!<br /><br />What this lacks is the sophistication and number of clues and puzzles that provide momentum for The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  The Lost Symbol and Inferno are also built on \\"brain teasers\\" and that's what helps me enjoy the books: can I figure out a clue before Robert Langdon does?  (And, yes, I did immediately know what Holy Wisdom meant in Inferno.  And that's about it.)  Digital Fortress gets bogged down somehow and, while things are constantly happening (and falling apart!), the forward motion slows and one just wants it all to end sooner not later, happily or otherwise.<br /><br />Brown's books are known for the cut-aways, the short chapters that are designed to create suspense.  But the constant cutting between action at NSA and the hunt-and-chase in Seville (Spain) is just too much too often.  Done well and sparingly and the reader is left hanging, longing for more information, wanting to know \\"what's next?\\"  Done too frequently and the reader simply feels jerked back and forth.  That's the case here, I think.<br /><br />So, yes, an interesting premise and puzzle, but lacks the sophistication of his later works.  And that's okay.  Writers have to develop just like everyone else.  Dan Brown's later works show that.  Still an interesting read (and as I said above, rather timely given current events).<br /><br />One aside: while Robert Langdon remains romantically unattached, that is not the casein Digital Fortress (not a Robert Langdon story).  The writing about relationships here really is just too weak, whether describing people or presenting dialogue.  Mr. Brown has been wise to avoid trying to inject romance into his later books.
B00BXJZ07A|5.0|Am 52 now, so I grew up listening to their music and am now enjoying their new album.... definitely from my generation!
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I admit that I never read the book. I loved the idea of this movie.  I just felt like at the end of the day.  It left me still wondering.. ok so what's life's purpose according to this movie?  I get the sub-plots, but at the end of the day, what is acheived with our connections and the choices we make?  We don't seem to really move any further towards a goal.  -I guess I want a goal, and end game.  Maybe there isn't one..  -But I did like the movie.  -I think it would have been helpful, if they made it more obvious who played who every reincarnation.  The makeup was so good, it was sometimes impossible to tell.  -End of the day, I would watch it again.  It is very thought provoking.
193700788X|1.0|After reading all the Sookie novels I can honestly say that by the last two novels you could tell Charlaine was sick of it. While I would love to say it was fantastic and ended with a boom. It ended with a dud. Perhaps her lack of creativity is why True Blood has taken such a different path from the novels. There was no where they could have gone with them except downhill. Great idea for the first few novels but a horrible follow through for the rest of them.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|My daughter is a big fan of the book & she really liked the way this movie was done.  I definitely recommend checking it out!
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Very neat game, not as good as flow free or bridges, but is still very interesting, will continue to play.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|This arm is sturdy and comes with everything you need to get setup.  I clamped the arm to the back of my cheap desk and it's 100% good to go.  Due to my desk design I couldn't actually get the clamp all the way onto the desk, but 2/3 for my 24\\" 9.9lb monitor is plent sufficient so far.<br /><br />the up and down axis is somewhat smooth, front to back is pretty good, but rotating screen left to right on the nearest axis to the screen could use improvement, it tends to flop down, unless you loosen up the whole thing and retighten.  You can turn the stand left to the right, but if you want to keep it full extended out toward you and then turn left or right, you could see problems.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the laws of physics really allow any of these stands to reliably do what I need, but it doesn't seem unreasonable.<br /><br />Overall I would buy it again, it gives me much more movement then sitting on a stand and front to back movement for extra desk space when needed.
B003IY48PS|5.0|THIS IS THE BLU-RAY VERSION OF THE<br />1981 HORROR MOVIE &#34; THE EVIL DEAD&#34;.<br /><br />I AM GLAD I BOUGHT THIS BLU-RAY, BECAUSE<br />IT CAME WITH THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION<br />PLUS THE UPDATED VERSION, UNCUT VERSION WHICH<br />HAS LOTS OF EXTRAS SCENES (1 disc).<br />THE SOUND AND PICTURE IS EXCELLENT, SO BUY IT<br />IF YOU ARE A &#34;BRUCE CAMPBELL&#34; FAN.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Good to try out the Prime account and the free movies seem to add value to the product.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|VERY, VERY GOOD MOVIE.<br />NO MATTER HOW MANY MILLION MEN OTHER<br />COUNTRIES HAVE IN THEIR ARMIES....<br />NO MATTER WHAT WEAPONS THEY HAVE<br />IN THEIR HANDS....<br /><br />THE UNITED STATES of AMERICA ARM FORCES IS UNIQUE IN EVERY WAY....<br />AND THERE ARE NO OTHER GIANT FORCE IN OUR PLANET Earth.<br /><br />GET THE MOVIE AND WATCH IT !.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I can create any type of relaxing for any situation, but mostly use it  at night when going to bed. I love all the different combinations and it works great on my kindle fire. I highly recommend this app!!!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was awesome! It was so cute. I actually read the book which was really good too. However the events in the book are a bit more mature than this movie and there were some things that happened in the book that did not happen in the movie. So the moral of this story in the book and the movies is like the beatles said All you need is love.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was a great introduction to Tesla, his life and the impact he had on the world. A lot of the information was new to me. Great easy read but so informative.

B000002LEE|4.0|'I saw the ocean break on the shore' wails Perry Farrell over Navarro's acid-dipped chords while the reckless, pulsating rhythms of Avery and Perkins form a ground-swell of support for what would become an all out assault on all things main stream rock and/or roll.  So was born the first studio recording from Alt-rock fore fathers, Jane's Addiction; and American hipsters everywhere rejoiced as we found our answer to The Clash, Smiths, Stone Roses and about half a dozen other English sub-mainstream rock acts that ruled college radio through the 80's.<br /><br />Stop for just a moment and take in the fact that 'Nothing's Shocking' turns 25 years old this year.  That's a quarter century that we've had to bask, and I mean bask, in what is arguably the best assemblage of alt-rock players the world has ever seen.  Focusing on Farrell's banshee cries on 'Had A Dad' and 'Mountain Song' or on Navarro's decadent, psychedelic fret board manipulation on 'Summertime Rolls' is as easy to do as it is rewarding.  But without the rhythmic reinforced foundation of Avery and Perkins throughout 'Nothing's Shocking' it seems unlikely that Navarro's sky-piercing solo on 'Mountain Song' or Farell's crass, nearly unhinged vocal on 'Idiot's Rule' or snarky tirade on 'Pigs In Zen' would have had the same weight; would have come across with the same unquestionable authority; or would have remained as remarkably timely and current as it has.<br /><br />Commercial suicide?  Jane's Addiction made a drug-addled career out of it.  Between videos that MTV refused to play and album covers that record stores refused to show, it's no wonder at all that this record, despite its richness and depth of left-of-center ear candy, sold poorly upon release.  For many fans who were born at the very tail end of Generation X, this band was defunct before we'd ever heard of them.  Of course that did nothing but add to the mystique and pull of this album as well as its successor.  Farrell and Co. were crowned the ultimate anti-sell outs by my Dr. Marten wearing friends and me and we would have gladly spent two weeks worth of fast food wages to see these four men play together twenty years ago.  They were to Alt-rock what the apple was to Adam.  How's that for a woefully inappropriate reference?<br /><br />So while the pacing of this album is geared (read: skewed) towards the slower, expansive tracks like 'Ted, Just Admit It,' 'Summertime Rolls' and even the beloved alt-ballad 'Jane Says,' it's the riff-based, destructive little gems of 'Ocean Size' and 'Mountain Song' that, for me at least, define this recording. Had the album featured even a couple more tracks of their simplistic, blissful un-pop sensibilities perhaps 'Nothing' Shocking' would have been the break away success that it should have been.<br /><br />Of course it wasn't until 1990, when we were on the cusp of the greatest musical revolution we're likely to ever see, that Jane's Addiction gave us 'Stop,' 'Been Caught Stealing,' and decided to flush seemingly assured super-stardom for lesser side-projects and copious quantities of illicit substances; leaving us with two of the most daring and singular debut and sophomore records of this or any genre.  'Nothing's Shocking' is an absolutely essential recording of the alternative movement and an album that, for nearly 25 years, has rewarded many an engaged listener.<br /><br />Enjoy with brash, triumphant abandon.ultimate anti-sell outs by my Dr. Marten wearing friends and me and we would have gladly spent two weeks worth of fast food wages to see these four men play together twenty years ago.

Had the album featured even a couple more tracks of their simplistic, blissful un-pop sensibilities perhaps 'Nothing' Shocking' would have been the break away success that it should have been.<br /><br />Of course it wasn't until 1990, when we were on the cusp of the greatest musical revolution we're likely to ever see, that Jane's Addiction gave us 'Stop,' 'Been Caught Stealing,' and decided to flush seemingly assured super-stardom for lesser side-projects and copious quantities of illicit substances; leaving us with two of the most daring and singular debut and sophomore records of this or any genre.  'Nothing's Shocking' is an absolutely essential recording of the alternative movement and an album that, for nearly 25 years, has rewarded many an engaged listener.<br /><br />Enjoy with brash, triumphant abandon.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a must see!  I am always ready to get home to see what is going to happen next! Can't wait for Season 2 to air on Amazon Prime!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Its a great show about multiple family fighting about the throne and action being taken. Crazy and dark at times!
B00D3V97DO|3.0|After being a musician now for nearly 30 years, drumming since i was 6 and just loving to be a music \\"listener\\" as well. Sabbath is the entire reason i chose metal. At about 5 (in 1979 or so) I saw my dads albums and Paranoid was one of them. Though he was more of a Jazz musician, I had always tended to lean towards the darker side of music. And with song titles like War Pigs, Electric Funeral and Rat Salad I was scared to death and LOVED IT! So on i went on my metal journey. I listened to all the 100 different inceptions of Sabbath but nothing was the \\"real deal\\" without Ozzy on board. And i couldn't listen to his solo stuff without wanting him back in the band. So now what did I expect after 35 years (not counting the 2 tracks recorded back in 1997)? Well, I expected what i got. Which was 3 old guys (Bill you flaked out buddy), getting in the studio for one last hora.<br /><br />  I didn't expect to hear another Iron Man, Sweat Leaf, or War Pigs at all. I knew the riffs would be as basic as they had been the last 20 some odd years, unless it was with Dio. When Tony had very creative guitar work, except Heaven and Hell (the band not the album) which wasn't very good in itself. There are a few stand out riffs, or riff breaks in many songs, but none really stick in your head like a deep metal rod. Damaged Soul, Dear Father and the deluxe edition tracks Pariah, and Methademic are very good and do capture a lot of good old classic Sabbath. Also why do they always make the bonus tracks better than what's on the actual LP!! I streamed it several times on Itunes, and people who had posted it on Youtube. I downloaded it for the sake of having something new to listen to, and because I have to give respect to the masters for a decent effort. God Is Dead? pretty much set the stage for the rest of the album, slow, Ozzy sounding like he's really not that enthused, even though we know he's still got that great voice. One song people actually hated was Loner, which I actually thought was quite good, with it's some what N.I.B vibe. Though all the songs are tuned very low and the this album is \\"read this\\" VERY OVERPRODUCED. I actually took the tracks and used a music editing program, and made the songs sound more like the 70's!! Lots of reverb, echo, and even sped them up a bit. Which to me made the album better. And on another note what happened to the song Scary Dreams, played live many times??? Now THAT song sounded like old classic Sabbath more than anything on here. Period. Oh well.<br /><br />  Some of the lyrics are very good, even though i'm not sure who came up with them this time, probably Geezer as usual. Zeitgeist is a pretty good attempt at making a Planet Caravan part 2. Complete with Ozzies phasered type vocals and Tonys good clean guitar solo at the end. While Damage Soul takes you back to the first album, with it's blues tinged riff, and jazzed up drumming. Which coming from Brad Wilk is actually not that great. Do i think Bill would have made the album sound much different? Probably not. Since Geez and Tone seem to be the only ones at the \\"top\\" of their game. But it's nice to hear Ozzy, the one and only back in the mix. Even if he does sound bored as hell. So as i mentioned, this album doesn't really have MUCH energy, which i didn't figure it would. Other than two of the bonus tracks (discluding Piece Of Mind), most just trudge along slowly, which isn't bad or good. It is what it is. A mediocre come back album from guys in their early 60's. And after 35 years i'm just glad they are all still \\"alive\\". So while it's not bad, it's not great, which as i said i didn't expect it to be. Raise your hopes high and you get torn down, expect it to be what you think and 90% of the time you'll be spot on. So glad to hear the album, but my initial excitement has warn out, just from streaming it for a week on Itunes. Although i do spin the bonus tracks a few times now and then.---Metal Drummer Man
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this sequel to Beautiful Creatures.  Same witty and fast-paced writing and plot.  Enjoyed the introduction of new characters.  The first person only writing does become more problematic in this novel, however, as we have very little insight into what is going on with Lena until the very end.  Even then, it's very much Ethan's perspective into what she &#34;must have been&#34; feeling and thinking.  This first person weakness will persist and become more frustrating as the series continues.  Still, great twists and surprises.  The series is worth every word until Beautiful Redemption, which is not worth reading at all.
B0074FUSRE|5.0|Fantastic mr. fox is a hard movie to find. I love it. Im so glad I was able to get it at such a great price and not pay some ridiculous fee for a hard to find movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I received the Wicked soundtrack about a week after I ordered it. It was just what I expected and more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows on tv.  It is clean and well written. To bad we can't get more writers in America to do shows of this caliber.
0425252868|5.0|I flew in WWII and this story gives me another perspective on the German Pilots.  They were professionals as our pilots.  They were not Nazis.  Four days before Christmas 1943, a badly damaged American bomber struggled to fly over wartime Germany. At its controls was a 21-year-old pilot. Half his crew lay wounded or dead. It was their first mission. Suddenly, a sleek, dark shape pulled up on the bomber's tail--a German Messerschmitt fighter. Worse, the German pilot was an ace, a man able to destroy the American bomber in the squeeze of a trigger. What happened next would defy imagination and later be called the most incredible encounter between enemies in World War II.<br /><br />This is the true story of the two pilots whose lives collided in the skies that day--the American--2nd Lieutenant Charlie Brown, a former farm boy from West Virginia who came to captain a B-17--and the German--2nd Lieutenant Franz Stigler, a former airline pilot from Bavaria who sought to avoid fighting in World War II. Five Stars
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Although this show is pretty violent I am sure it show the way it was back then.  I really love the cast  and totally enjoying the story.  Next season can't come soon enough for me.
B009AVFROY|5.0|Unfortunately seether makes it so that buying this full album is the only way to access the last 8 songs on it, of which make purchasing the cd totally worth it.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Great CD. Jimi Hendrix at his best! I recommend this CD to all Jimi Hendrix fans! You won't be disappointed.
B005LAIGTG|5.0|First off I'm not usually a romantic fan as I'm forced to watch with my wife..ha ha. The Vow is different from \\"The Notebook\\"..The Vow is a couple notches down in the love story intensity department....yes I'll admit it, the Notebook is a tear jerker and The Vow was not, it was just a real good story about unfailing love and dedidcation of a man trying to reach out to his wife with amnesia and help her remember their life together. Rachel Mcadams is superb as she was in The Notebook..
B0077EBWVI|5.0|more of the ori. story line but with a few new twists and this one is just as good as the first one .
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I play this game more than any other game I have on my Kindle :)  I play this for hours and hours, I can't stay away!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I cannot believe this story did not end with this book.  Trilogy?? I could not wait for this book to come out and the delivery dates were continually getting pushed back.  I was so excited to read it when I got it to only find out there is going to be another one.  Perhaps trying to one up another series or make more money?  There is much more to be told and finalized with the story but there was a lot in my opinion in this book that didn't even need to be brought up & made so much a part of the story.  I am undecided if I will get the 4th book or not.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have this Bible on my Android Smartphone and I really like it, but it won't download properly on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it and it asks me to sign in, but when I do, it says I don't exist.  LOL funny for a Bible to say that.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Its really fun. Entertains the player for hours. Very good for passing time. Awesome armorial selection straight from the movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing this game whenever I get the time to sit and wait for something else to happen. If you like Mahjong, get this game!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Prime member so price was excellent enjoyed the movie, Cameron Diaz plays a cute prego, believe JLo was really pregnant when made this movie, Its worth seeing
B004UID2LC|3.0|It plays music on my Kindle Fire HD, but I can't find the downloading button to keep a playlist on it

B00AEFY3MC|5.0|The tounge in cheek poking fun is hilarious especially because it is very close to the truth.  If you have ever been to a Star Trek convention, its repoduction is spot on.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I love running through all the world's especially the dead world it is very challenging. It is a great game.I play it all the time it is very addicting.
B004XWLIJS|4.0|I don't always remember what these are about, but I remember they are always entertaining and violent but without a lot of bloody gore and guts on the floor.  I understand that part and don't need to see it to remind me.  It is just about a physical process and damage.  What I like to watch is his nonchalant way of approaching his job.  Sometimes he forms an attachment to a young innocent person.  Sometimes he falls in love with a beautiful young feisty lady who he is transporting to keep her safe.  It is not great theatre or cinema, but keeps moving and usually does not waste time.  It's a way to get away and relax.  My vice. Kind of innocent because at least I don't drink and carouse around.  I am just being honest here.  Sometimes I just want to get away from thinking.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft always was awesome now it's much better it has cake,spawn eggs , buckets,realms I LOVE IT!!! I bought this a long time ago but now I want to make a review . I didn't look at the screenshots reviews or description because first chance I get I bought it
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Pretty good. Has a little more than your usual gangster movie.  Based on fact, but the shootings by the gangster squad are reportedly highly exaggerated compared to real life. Seems to illustrate the need for Federal intervention in cases where local government does not have the resources to deal with organized crime. Resorting to a gangster squad operating outside the law is outrageous. The movie does not seem to make this point but it follows naturally for anyone who is thinking about government conduct.  Does the end justify the means seems to be the issue.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have only watched four episodes, but find it witty and sharp, with terrific acting. The two leads play beautifully off one another and are a joy to watch.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The opening scenes are exciting and show the skills of the pilot.  But afte that, it becomes not a pilot/flying movie, but a movie with a different message.  So as not to spoil it, I would say, I lost interest because I thought it was a flying movie.  For what it does, it is good; but it's not a topic of my interest.
B0040GSVH4|5.0|It's Journey. Hello?! How could you not love it? I grew up listening to Journey. I have a JBL Bluetooth Flip that sounds awesome.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|Challenges should be twice a week not once. Found the game some what challenging. I like the ideal of getting more coins for each level.
B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Good drama, great music. If you're a musical theatre fan, you will definitely enjoy this series!  Kathryn McPhee is phenomenal!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Rather complicated plot but plenty of suspense and heroics by Jack. Lee Child gives plenty of good details and description in his writing to let almost feel like you are in Reacher's head. Looking forward to number 3!
1932735410|5.0|If you're planning to take the PMP exam, this study guide offers really good and really challenging exercises that help you think about how the really lengthy, excessively worded questions might appear on the exam. It also helps you think about the many ways you can use project management tools in everyday careers.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series keeps me guessing as to what will happen next.  It is something that I would highly recommend it to some one that wants to watch something that will put you on the edge of your seat.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are lots of different types of games. Most of the games are short and fun. It may take a while to unlock all games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just love this app  l builder  a library and a 3story house the advantages are that there are no frunacher
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book was a bit of a drag. Didn't end in a believable way. Eric is barely in this book and why introduce \\"a devil\\" in the beginning? Just blah. I thought this would be a spectacular ending to the series, but it really wasn't anything special.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is incredible. So intense, you almost feel like you're a part of it. Its no surprise it won best picture.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I love any movie with Jimmy Stewart, but this was very sweet and enlightening...I would recommend this movie for any family to see.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|I have read all the books and I didn't think Cruise could pull it off - size and attitude.  it is a great movie but he is not Reacher
B000059TCE|5.0|Thank for sending me my movies. I enjoyed watching them. Great experience came in good condition. Will Oder again. Really happy.
B0000026T4|5.0|Its Alice Cooper, what else do I need to say. He is one of the best out there and this iconic 80's album backs it up.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|For years, I have had a pre-conceived notion that this series was bad. I was wrong!  I have been shockingly surprised by how much I enjoyed watching Lost. Action, adventure, romance, mystery, \\"The Others,\\" & probably one of my very favorite characters on TV, Hurley, all work together to keep you waiting to see the next episode. Great TV!
B00902S0IS|4.0|good, old fashioned sci fi at it's best. Kids even got into it. Really fun to see Leslie Nielson young and serious.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|What a let down. I have liked this author for some time now, and LOVED the first two books. I waited for this final book in the trilogy thinking of diffrent ways that she would wrap it all up and send them off into a literary Happily Ever After. Well I guess I will keep waiting.  I try not to read the reviews on any book that I am currently reading to keep my opinion clear, but I now have to agree we so many of the fans that are seriously disappointed.  This was a trilogy that could have been wrapped up in a trilogy. Going to a 5 part serise will only streach this story out too thinly for its plotline.  I know publishers are hurting, but to make your readers hang on for two more weak, and  streached out books for the sake of sales is wrong.  I loved this caracters and have gone from wishing them the best to feeling sorry for them and their endless drama.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|1st off...if you are wondering if you should get the Deluxe version? Absolutely! The extra songs are probably the best on this album, at least to me.<br /><br />Classic Sabbath and Ozzy is dead on with the vocals. Bass tracks are just incredible, leaving no doubt you are listening to Sabbath.<br /><br />I'm not much on reviews, but had to write something to give it 5 stars.<br /><br />This is simply the Album of the Year for 2013.
B0061QD88S|5.0|im so glad i orderd this dvd from  amazon,<br />its a TRUE family movie for all ages,<br />i love how  the plot is,<br />lady & the tramp  is a must dvd for all disney lovers !!!<br /><br />im very pleased with the order & seller!!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I was so disappointed by this book.  The story started strong, giving good background on all of the characters.  The author made me connect with the characters and the story.  I was hooked...until the climax.  At this point, it became predictable.  I kept hoping that I was wrong, but I wasn't.  Once I realized that I had figured out the ending, I actually felt a little sad.  For the first time in a very long time, the author disappointed me.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I was looking for a puzzle game and found this one. Now l<br />can't stop playing. The best thing by far.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my go to game after a hard day or any day!  It is what I do to relax.  Thanks for such a wonderful game and keep the new rooms coming!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I got so wrapped up in the characters and stories that I was sorry when the book ended.  I look forward to book three.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Ok so one day I clicked on the app store and saw these battery saving apps. Lets get down to the fact that you can not charge a battery wireless. But here is what is interesting. Once you download this, it tells you many ways to save your battery power. I was losing easily 2 to about 5 hours of charge on my kindle fire. I read and researched battery saving apps for an hour, found this to be the best and now I love it. Just by downloading this app you save easily 2 hours of battery power. Using the features and configs you save 5 hours. When you plug in your phone, tablet, kindle fire, kindle fire HD, and all the the different iPads, it shows 3 light bulb symbols to show how good your charge is. The extra lightbulb for the top of the line charging saves you so much power. I used to have to shut down my kindle a lot to save power, and now I do not need to do that unless it freezes up.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Daft Punk having fun deviating from pure electronica by adding disco music influences thus creating some interesting sounds.  A nice mix and pushes electronica more into the mainstream.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thanks to my prime subscription I was able to enjoy seasons 1 & 2 over and over to my content. Now I'm ready for more! Luv luv
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Some people pan this movie but I believe they expect too much from it.  If you enjoy road-trip and sci-fi type movies then this one is for you.  There are plot twists and a bow to evolution.  Please don't have the kiddies watch this as they'll pick up some new slang you won't want them repeating.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This organizer met my needs. It is precisely what I needed for organizing my appointments, meetings, etc. Thank for this free application.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|not too happy as  it is now well explained and you need to pay for additional coins to buy cards
030726999X|5.0|Read the trilogy!  Very good!  Takes you to places where you don't want to go...when you are done you shake your head and come out of the rabbit hole; you are never really comfortable,  A total must read, but you must read all.
1400032717|5.0|I had already read this book and found it to be a wonderful tool for understanding how an autistic person sees the world as opposed to what others sees. Need to share so I bought this book for that reason.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum...the best  ever.  I love my Country....and they sing it!  And great singing!  Wonderful crossover group!  Always waiting for the next song.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I had already seen this film and loved it so much I had to own it. Bought a copy for my back surgeon as his daughter has autism and it is so inforrmative.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Love Lady A, have from, &#34;Need You Now&#34;! Great group, great sound. Maybe need more than just break up songs and a few upbeat songs.
B004DF3S7A|3.0|Not his usual songs, but I knew that when I bought it. I decided to take a chance. More mellow songs.
B00CJVZB5W|4.0|I love Rod Stewart's voice in any decade. I don't love all of his songs that he's ever made but I do enjoy the majority of them and I'm so happy he came out with another album! I like most of these songs, the happy ones! :)
B006R1T40I|4.0|Not my absolute favorite, but still a very good CD. Bonnie is a legend - her voice is so soulful and sometimes sad.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Unless there is some kind of trick to using this, the pictures are grainy and lighting is poor.  Not sure where the pics are stored.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I can't get enough of this CD. Play it at home, at work, sing it in my sleep. It is that good!
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Came as promised, perfect as stated. My praise will be rejected if I don't write the amount of words required. This is America, more attention is paid to seconds-long commercials than given to hour long shows! :LOL! Thanks Seller!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My grandson enjoys playing this. Game because he can build his Dragon into a bigger one .  he likes this game
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm 60 years of age and have never played a Game like this. It has been frustratingly difficult at times but always delightful and surprising with a resolution to each stage of the puzzle. I'm sure many have already said this, but this game is addictive. Thanks for all the fun I'm having with this. Best, Jess
B009Z5975A|5.0|I hate, hate, hate watching Goonies on TV. They always cut out most of the early and middle character building stuff that has cause the story to have such endurance. The Blu-ray version is a life saver.<br /><br />Gremlins is just a great deal of fun.<br /><br />Gremlins 2 is actually fairly hard to track down, getting it was honestly a cheap bonus for getting the two movies I really love.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very helpful to have time left displayed. Seems like a flood app. I'm happy I bought the app rather than getting the free version. Jess
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I find the quite fascinating. It's fun, intuitive, and generally a great show to watch. It helps bring people down to earth in a gentle way.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive.  I cannot get enough of this game.  The kids also enjoy playing it.
B002XXPNXG|5.0|Interesting story with a nice job done by the actors. It flows nicely and and brings you beyond the every day of life into all its possibilities.
0385349947|4.0|This is one book that I feel should be given as a high school/college graduation gift. Not just a motivational book but one that will make you re-think career choices as well as incorporating those decisions into your family life.  I highly recommend it for younger women just starting out in the workforce as it will enable them to expand their leadership roles. &#34;Lean In&#34; should be in the library of every corporate Business Resource Group - I know I recommended it!
B008602KQI|5.0|It is great! attractive! let you involved in the movie and feel just like the actor and actress's feelings.<br />Thanks!
B004SH40BQ|3.0|Was looking to have this bluetooth an iPod classic into my wife's new 2014 Mazda 6, as THAT car has a MAJOR MAJOR desgn fault with the existing audio system-plugging in an iPod hardwire requires the radio to \\"load\\" the music library into the radio EVERYTIME you start the car-and it loads at @ 500 songs a minute so do THAT math on a 80-160 iPod... GREAT car, but if you're a die-hard music fan as we are this is an epic fail- Mazda forums are full of people having similar complaints, but I digress..<br /><br />This thing works OK in the car- it's dropped out a couple of times, and it doesn't transmit song info via BT, but when it's working it sounds fine. The killer for me any most people is the fact it cuts battery life in half and has no \\"pass-through\\" to charge the device it's drawing from, so for long drives where having thousands of songs to random from or bunches of loaded playlists you'll run out the battery-especially if you forget to turn it off as you may do leaving it in a center console and such. 3-stars.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Nice mixer of legal intrigue and politics and family problems.<br />Just don't understand the title: The GOOD wife....for somebody who is cheating on her husband ?!?!
B004NELBPC|2.0|I would have expected this to be a much better app considering the Aneroid version works great. Its unfortunate that the developers wont take the time to fix something that seems to be standard in any news app...adjustable font size. They must feel there are not enough Kindle users to make it worth the change. Shame...
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Patch Adams is a great movie. It really captures the spirit of compassion and sheds light on the fact that healing requires more than just medicine. I found the film to be very inspirational and challenging. It was a real blessing to watch!
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|If you have played the Lego Batman 2 game, the plot of this movie will be very familiar to you.  In fact, its almost as if Traveler's Tales figured they could throw a game together on the cheap by re-using the cut scenes from the video game.  Although its not a complete clone of the game, some scenes are re-edited and re-cut so they aren't exact, but they are close enough.<br /><br />If you are over the age of 12, then there isn't a ton of stuff in this movie to interest you.  There are some references to past Batman movie and TV incarnations and the recreation of the 1989 Tim Burton Batman movie opening from LEGO bricks is a classic.  My kids watch the scene and yell out \\"The bat-symbol!\\" every time they watch it.  There is also a scene where Superman hears the Richard Donner Superman film's theme and says \\"That music sounds familiar.\\"  To which Batman replies \\"I don't listen to music.\\"  I just about fell over when I found out that my kids don't instantly equate that tune with Superman!  (a travesty that I will have to straighten out!\\"<br /><br />The attention to detail is something else that is impressive in this movie.  The recreation of the models out of LEGO bricks would be impressive enough.  But you can actually see where the minifigure's joints rub together creating scratches on the body.  Also, if the light hits them just right, you can see fingerprints on the minifigs that must be left over from whoever built this LEGO Gotham City and is imagining the story.<br /><br />Its easy to imagine that this story was thought up by some 10 year old.  Its not too deep, full of silly humor, and the majority of the violence is off-screen.  This movie really is geared toward the younger audience and there is not anything in it that I would not feel comfortable letting my kids watch.  The message of teamwork runs throughout the movie and even Batman learns that its OK to ask for help when he calls in the rest of the Justice League in to help the threat posed by Lex Luthor and the Joker.<br /><br />The movie is called DC Superheroes unite, but it could have easily been called the Batman/Superman hour.  About 90% of the movie focuses on those two heroes while The Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Cyborg get a quick guest appearance in the final moments of he movie.  So if you are stoked for the TV screen debut of the Flash don't blink because it will be over in a flash!<br /><br />My kids (a 6 year old son and a 7 year old daughter) have watched this movie at least 5 times in the week that we have owned this movie.  They love LEGO and they love Superheroes so this movie is a good fit for them.  The fun doesn't stop with the feature though.  There are 5 stop motion shorts made out of LEGO that were part of an online contest, 3 episodes of WB superhero cartoons (Teen Titans, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Justice League), and a featurette on building LEGO Batman.  My kids have to watch all of the special features each time they watch the movie and have discovered Batman: The Brave and the Bold because of this.<br /><br />Lastly, the movie comes with an exclusive Clark Kent turning into Superman LEGO minifigure.  Its a really neat piece that LEGO probably won't release anywhere else (though I wouldn't put money on that) so if you are a minifig completeist, you need to get the movie.  I can tell you that this LEGO Clark Kent has watched this movie a few times along with his pal LEGO Superman.  At least on the days my son can figure out where he left them.r and the Joker.<br /><br />The movie is called DC Superheroes unite, but it could have easily been called the Batman/Superman hour.  About 90% of the movie focuses on those two heroes while The Flash, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and Cyborg get a quick guest appearance in the final moments of he movie.  So if you are stoked for the TV screen debut of the Flash don't blink because it will be over in a flash!<br /><br />My kids (a 6 year old son and a 7 year old daughter) have watched this movie at least 5 times in the week that we have owned this movie.  They love LEGO and they love Superheroes so this movie is a good fit for them.  The fun doesn't stop with the feature though.  There are 5 stop motion shorts made out of LEGO that were part of an online contest, 3 episodes of WB superhero cartoons (Teen Titans, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Justice League), and a featurette on building LEGO Batman.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|Its great. The movie after finishing the whole game is funny. The monsters are funny. It's a little like those three d Chinese puzzles.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Addictive game. Hard to stop one I start. Always have enjoyed mahjong. There are so many configurations to chose from.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I'll keep it short: this album is in many ways a spiritual successor to Geogaddi, dark at some turns, and profoundly beautiful at others. The sounds are a mixture of the old and new. The songs build in gloriously entertaining ways, and the single \\"Reach for the Dead\\" is the most beautiful, uplifting, and perfect song released so far this year. If you're a BOC fan, and even if you're not, Tomorrow's Harvest is an excellent album in every way possible and is perhaps one of the greatest comeback albums of all time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good game! Especially for free! I totally recommend getting this free game! This would be a great game for your little boy or girl.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tesla's story is fascinating and a great example of how everyone should always seek out the things that are intellectually stimulating. This story is also a heartbreaking reminder that sometimes the best tech doesn't win out due to the greed of others.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|For those of you who, like me, believed this book would be the end of the series, you will be sorely mistaken. As I was reading this and new \\"plot twists\\" were being introduced, I became worried that Sylvia Day was going to try to draw this series out as much as she could. And I was right. It's such a disappointment that she decided to add new parts to the story during what should have been the final book just to continue to get money. Normally, I wouldn't say an author was trying to do that, but unfortunately it really seems like that is the case with this author. I was excited to see how she was going to take the parts of the story and wrap it all up with a good ending. And now I won't get to see that until book 5 according to her website?! If you really cared about your readers you would have made this book the end of Gideon and Eva's story and open the possibility for spin-offs with Megumi's story, but no. Instead we were strung along and now it looks like I'm not the only one who was disappointed. I had been counting down the days until this book came out so I could find out what happens and learn an ENDING to the story. I'm not even excited for the next book now. I may not even bother with it at this point.... I am so disappointed with this author now....
B001BJNIIK|5.0|i don't care, i remember all the great action movies from back in the day. yeah yeah i might be dating myself but these are the greatest movies made and i always loved this one with sly and kurt. too bad they didn't do more together........who knows maybe on another &#34;expendables&#34;????? and as a foot note i am soooo happy we do have the expendables, because sly put all the greatest in one pachage!!!!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Never thought this would be something I would like but my son Made me watch it, now im addicted. I had to watch it all over again.
B008602KQI|5.0|one of the few movies that followed the book. I usually feel pretty let down after reading the book before the movie, but in this case I was as excited at the end of the movie as I was to finish the book. I cannot wait for the next one in the series.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|love the movie I would buy it again lol it was new and great for the price I can watch this movie all day
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Doesnt work! Was not able to get this app to work for my kindle.  To bad, I like Youtube.  Deleted App
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A must have for any Kindle user. Before, I didn't realize how much crap was eatting away at my space. this app cleaned all that up! easy to use. everyone should use it.
0596809158|5.0|I thought Paul Teetor did a great job here.  Although he claims it's not a book to learn R, in conjunction with a basic R book like \\"The Art of R Programming\\" by Matloff, this book is all you need to learn the hundreds of idioms that make up the daily practice of using any language.  However, Mr. Teetor undersells himself by not claiming that it's a book for learning R because I have found it BETTER than Matloff's book as a \\"go to\\" book whenever I've forgotten something.<br /><br />Matloff's book, while good, is desultory in a certain sense because it hops around its topics too much and uses tools yet to be covered much later in the book in current examples.  The R Cookbook has a beautiful systemization to it.  For example,  you don't have to wait 'til the middle of the book to see how to see how to read into all the basic R data structures.  I/O, usually under-covered in all programming books, has a vital early appearance in Teetor's book.<br /><br />His order of coverage is fabulous and he doesn't bamboozle readers with \\"real world\\" examples in each chapter that cover advanced features that are promised to be explained \\"later\\".  If you need to know something that's in his code, you get your explanation NOW, not LATER.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I downloaded this app because it is always handy to have somewhere to write in your kindle, making it useful for work too. It also has the to do list which is really cool!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Still haven't gotten it figured out how to play all the games, but it is a change from Angry Birds which I'm tired of right now. Will go back to them later. Enjoying this game for now.
0312944926|3.0|This writing takes a long time, perhaps half of the book, to get really interesting.  I felt he didn't know half about the NSA as he did about other subjects such as symbols and the Vatican..  Francine
B008PZZZWA|4.0|A little farfetched but good acting by Pacino and Robin Williams. Plot requires a suspension of belief but all and all it kept me awake.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Spend your time playing subway surfers this game is real easy but when you have 300<br />Coins it gets hard  . It go by country .This week I'm in Miami .Trust me this game<br />is asome .
B0037VNX44|1.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Sure, it was working off a pretty thin story to begin, but at the end of the film, I simply didn't care about a single character. The acting was good enough, but the main character is so simply evil, it isn't remotely interesting. He's one-sided, flat. His artistic endeavors are forced, and seem to be more the contrivation of a forced homoeroticism than a legitimate way to progress the plot. THe joke back in the day was that Jude Law would take his shirt off in each film, merely for the sake of Jude Law taking his shirt off. It seems like Tom Hardy gets naked, merely for the sake of Tom Hardy getting naked.<br /><br />The string of anecdotes regarding violent acts is just incredibly monotonous. Fight Club has a twist, it has a social commentary, it addresses the mindless, contrived gentleness of the modern man to fit into society. A Clockwork Orange is brutal, but a heavy critique of the justice system and their inability to even play to basic human nature effectively. Bronson is shallow, vulgar, and boring.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I am very very happy with this app.  Does what it says, nothing more nothing less. I would have played for it as I find it useful.
B004V45YBG|5.0|As a long-time student of the French language abd culture, I was pleased to find this novel that reintroduced me to Flaubert from a very different perspective.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It's hard to make emotions tangible and impact a reader as much as the characters in the story you think would be but this book does it. it will leave you looking at life through a different lense.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Any horror fan will love this movie. It has classic scares and suspence. The scares work well because the ghost isn't completely shown throughout most of the film, which makes it even scarier. Good acting and effects.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the newest update they added realms, buckets,and CAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />So awesome i needed eight more words so you should realize
0307887960|5.0|This book was like brand new! I was very pleased.<br />It has helped me loose 13.5 pounds so far. Being middle aged...and having tried for 10 plus years to lose a few pounds, was nearly impossible, til I tried this easy to follow and use diet. I had the book two days and my daughter in law borrowed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The first time I played this game it seemed boring then I realized there were missions and different people to buy and they have different clothes u can get and I think keys are hard to get and so r the flamingos and little Japanese girls for the Tokyo and Miami ones and I have to tell u this game is addicting and fun to me I can sit and play this game till my kindle goes dead :)
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this game. My kindle recently crashed when I reached level 54 now I have to start over. That's a bummer but I'll start it all again .Curious George was my name for my 100+ friends out there. I miss you all. At least now I'm more familiar with the game-ill be back up there in no time! Really good game for busy grandparents.
B00785P2QC|4.0|All though the bait and hook app games are a dime a dozen. This one is pretty good. I think this game is additive but fun.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|Is this movie based on a book.  Wow!  How can you not feel some serious girl power after watching this. James McAvoy I love you!
B000002J6H|5.0|Getting reacquainted with this record long after losing the vinyl was like catching up with an old friend. Yes, he's a bit of a redneck. Hardly politically correct. The compression/sustain on some of the guitar tracks, and the echo on his voice is a bit irritating. But, that slow rock Do for the Others is just addictive. The bassline integrates into the guitar work so well. Real drums, real cymbals are like water to one starving in the desert. Outside of jazz, they've almost all been replaced by drum machines today. Love the one you're With is sopping with pre-HIV morality. Over-produced perhaps. Black Queen feels straight out of smoky Nawlins (New Orleans). Great cameos by Hendrix not long before his demise and Clapton. We are not Helpless was a counter-argument to Neil Young's Helpless on the Deja Vu album. Perhaps there was some tension in Stills' old group? Ya think? I like his reply. Strong. Optimistic. Again, dated, non inclusive. \\"We are not helpless we are men. What lies between us can be set aside and ended.\\" Right on!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|So good! MMMMM! The whole concept was so sweet. Great date movie and good feelings all over. Definately recommend you see.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I got this for my mom and she watched it over one weekend, which is surprising cause she never just sits at the TV.  It was really great cause I got digital access to it also.  HD picture looks great!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Come on, I'm seeing all these epic reviews about the new 0.7.1 update on Facebook but when I went to update on my kindle there was no update available :((! I've been dying for this update, you won't get a five star out of me until you update, Amazon! Boo!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I can't wait for the next season. Can't get any better than that! The story line keeps it moving along.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is hilarious! Loved every second of it. A fabulous cast of characters with such humor and wit packed in every page. Be warned: Do not read in public unless you don't mind the stares when you can't stop cracking up!!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I was a huge fan of Gillian Flynn's &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and &#34;Dark Places&#34; books, so I was really looking forward to this novel.  Overall, it was a fun and solid read.  Flynn's character development is fascinating, and the plot was fairly interesting (but less complex than her other two novels).  The plot strayed at times and resolved in a somewhat odd manner.<br /><br />Overall, a fun and short read to enjoy while awaiting Flynn's next novel :)
B004HO6I4M|4.0|My 5 and 2 yr old love this movie. It's my second copy by the way as the first got scratches from repeated playing. My son turned 4 to 5 watching this. It's a very nice story, colorful, good for the kids to know about the exotic birds of Rio and Brazil. One thing that put me off was the drawing of characters. If you look closely enough, you'll see the same face for a number of characters. For example, the security guard at the aviary looks just like the tourist whose watch the monkey steals. The driver of the van of \\"Exotic Pets\\" in Minnesota and the police officer at the aviary in Rio look exactly the same.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah...it has a deep meaning and it is for a sophisticated audience..blahblahblah.. It was pretty...pretty ho-hum for me. Hey, I watch 3D movies to get the fun pop-out experience and it wasn't the movie for that kind of experience. It wouldn't have made sense to put pop outs in it. It was visually beautiful, I will give it that. It was also thought provoking but not in a good way for me. After I watched it, I really didn't want to think about this journey but couldn't help myself. I guess I just didn't like the story/stories.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I haven't been that impressed with recent King, but this one was a good read.  He is back to his old tricks, making the outlandish situation seem plausible by forcing the reader to see, feel, hear, and smell the mental movie scene as it is presented.  Lots of fun, and it not only had a pretty funny Christine reference, but a Doctor Who reference as well.  That always deserves an \\"A\\" in my book.
B00B4804KS|3.0|Sound was horrible on this!! If you live in a home with plenty of land around you, it won't be a problem...if you live in an apartment or house that is only a few feet away from your neighbors, be prepared for complaints. Why they had to screw up the sound on this wonderful movie it beyond me. AND, they did it intentionally! Guess what, Jurassic Park is awesome enough on its own without elevating the dino sounds to insane levels. Obviously you can turn down the sound but then you can't hear the dialog. Or you can be encumbered with the remote in your hand the whole movie trying to keep it level.<br /><br />The 3D was cool but no pop-outs and I am a pop-out ho...just love them. Yes, I am juvenile and want the WOW factor...that is my whole reason for watching anything in 3D. But it wasn't filmed in 3D so I am thinking if it was, they would have enlisted that technology but it is hard to create pop-outs after the fact.<br /><br />So if you want your neighbors happy and still want your hearing when you reach your 70's, stick with the old version because it is a very cool movie with no magnification needed.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Quite thrilling, and almost impossible to put down. The story line was fast-paced, with unexpected twists and turns. I loved the entire thing and hope for more!
1781162646|4.0|Stephen King's newest book, Joyland, is being released solely in paperback form (for the time being) as part of the Hard Case Crime imprint, which is the same imprint that previously released King's The Colorado Kid. Like Kid, Joyland boasts a spectacularly pulpy cover, and the book jacket boasts happenings that would make the book a perfect fit for a classic pulp bookshelf - in this case, murderous happenings at a summer carnival. But like Colorado Kid, Joyland works better as its own novel than it does as a traditional pulp story, and its inclusion in the imprint's release titles seems more like a marketing ploy than an indication of the book itself. None of which is to say that Joyland isn't a good book. Like King does so often, Joyland creates a beautiful portrait of a distant era, where a young man still reeling from a bad breakup finds himself caught up in a summer carnival job and the people he meets through the experience. Is there a murder? Yes...but it ends up feeling like a somewhat superfluous section of the book, as though it's tacked in more to fill a requirement than because it was an integral part of the story. But that's okay, because what draws you in to Joyland is the character work and the portrait of life in a summer carnival. As you'd expect from King, the dialogue is sharp, the characters memorable, the ambiance perfectly captured, and the personal drama involving and rich. No, the \\"story\\" isn't particularly strong (it's not bad, either; just kind of forgettable), but as always with King, Joyland is less about what it's about and more about how it goes about it.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautifully designed app that evokes memories of The Davinci Code. Intricate puzzles that kept my son and I busy for hours.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The only complaints I have are (1) I have to wait so long for the next season but since that's not a problem with the video it didn't count against it.  and (2) that there isn't air play for the iPad and Amazon video isn't available  through Apple TV.  But again nothing to do with the video.<br /><br />The story is great.  The acting is great.  And I don't usually care for period pieces but I got sucked in right from the start of season 1.
B00CH4FPB6|4.0|If you have subscribed an NBA PASS and/or NBA TV Live is the perfect app to see it. No crash, perfect video just a little bit latency in buffering.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I bought this film hoping it would be something special.  It turns out to be a disjointed collection of bad acting.  Tom Hanks delivers a variety of roles but it is very difficult to follow and terribly boring.  Don't waste your money on this one.  Rent it first.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|Hercules is a classic Disney movie that will always be a favorite of mine! What more do I need say?
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I stayed fairly engaged throughout the reading of this third book of the trilogy.<br />My biggest criticism is the absence of a spiritual component in these characters. After all, human beings are body, mind and spirit no matter what their spirituali beliefs.  I would like to rewrite the book adding a Christian spiritual component which I found lacking and which left me empty.  Because of this missing component, the characters seemed rather flat.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was hard to put down! I will be looking for the rest on Amazon you can be sure!
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|As with all movies by j.J. Abrams and Robert orci and the other clown they are all very heavy on action and great CG effects but have more holes in the plot than swiss cheese. Here is what I liked about both the new star trek movies. The casting, they did a great job casting everyone. The effects are of course great and I really love the music. Here is what I didn't like about the new one (I will skip all the massive holes and horrible story of the first movie), There is no back story between Kahn and Kirk so it takes away all the drama that was present in the original movie and one of the main reasons it was so great, in this version its just flat, he is just another villian kirk doesnt know at all. about 10 minutes solid of people just running. they changed the whole story around to kill kirk instead of spock which is fine to change the story around but he was back to life in less than 10 minutes and you knew how they were going to bring him back from about 1/3 of the way through the movie. I hate the whole spock uhura thing its stupid and now spock is crying its like he is just a regular crew member now and no different than all the humans. And also very important is that bones has become useless. They give him a couple lines of im a doctor not a such and such but he has no real role in the movie and there is no trio like in the original series where one was giving you logic and the other the emotion and then kirk had to blend them. There is also no moral story here, like the revenge theme in kahn, or the relocation theme of insurrection or even the environmental theme of the voyage home. This is just a Saturday matinee with lots of effects and little story. I hope now that JJ is going to go off and ruin star wars too im hoping the can get someone else who can write a movie with a decent plot.

B000ICXQXS|5.0|This is a classic film.  I saw it years ago and the recent reviewing was as good as the first time,  We saw some details we missed on the first viewing.  It is a clever and fun movie.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I'm sitting here on my covered deck in the rain. The temperature is correct, but the little detail of moisture has been overlooked. It actually pouring, and not one speck of green shows on the radar map. In fact, it states foggy and cloudy in the forecast. Maybe the fog got overloaded with moisture? I do not care for the radar aspect of this app, it is clunky to use  and obviously inaccurate. There is no indication of rain anywhere near me. There are much better radar systems out there,perhaps an update is needed.
B00B2DGYQS|2.0|Eytan Fox has a great track record of getting the most out of his actors, creating interesting stories, using music to augment the films in interesting ways, and adding lots of auxiliary characters to his scripts that add to the enjoyment of the films. In Yossi, his latest offering, all the aforementioned qualities are presented in a great cast and storyline.<br /><br />The problem with the storyline however, is that it seems highly unbelievable to me. The lead character's significant depression is a good example. I know that they have antidepressants and quality psychotherapy in Israel. To be this depressed, as Yossi seems, for a 10 year period, without someone along the way suggesting getting help, seems ludicrous to me.  It also doesn't make sense to me that he appears to have friends and acquaintances that attempt to help him out with his depression, seem to get nowhere with it, and yet continue to attempt to keep working on him. Most people would move on.<br /><br />The creepy part of the story is how he handles his heart patient, his dead lover's Mother. He shows up at her home, unannounced, tells his sad story, and burdens her and the lover's Father with all his stuff, stored up over the past 10 year. The Father seems a decent sort and attempts to help him out. But his Sad Sack routine should not have been visited on his patient. He should have been dealing with it in a more appropriate way.<br /><br />It was hard to believe that the young soldier, Tom, who made a serious play for Yossi, would have been realistically attracted to him. From the looks of him, and his bubbly personality, and major attractiveness, choosing someone as depressed and with such poor self esteem as Yossi would have been a choice  way down on the list of possible applicants for his heart.<br /><br />It would have been very interesting if Eytan had gone into the psychology of why Tom would find Yossi attractive and pursue him with such ardor. Clearing up that information would have added a great deal to the film and helped make the story much better. Instead, he slapped on this happy ending to the film, way too soon, without examining the psychology behind it ,and what lead up to it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film was a disappointment that could have been much better with a longer and more inclusive story. Eytam sure had the actors and the story idea to do it.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|The Blu-Ray disc  is perfect it looks great. The restoration of the film is excellent enjoyed watching it. To bad it did'nt have with a digital book.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I cannot get over the quality of the Martian animation Characters in this movie. Even the shadows are great. Anyone who criticizes Edgar Rice Burroughs does not see the great imaginative capabilities a story like this has. Everyone is a critic and sometimes critics let the personal feelings get in the way of a good movie. I would love to see this in blu-ray 3d.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|This ranks with LeCarre's best, including Tinker, Tailor and A Perfect Spy.  The characters and their motivations are richly complex and diverse.  The plot requires little or no suspension of disbelief and is as suspenseful as anything he's written.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|AIC is one of my favorite bands (both versions) and I have been waiting for this album for a long time. It did not disappoint. In this age of over analysis via internet reviews, blogs, etc. I wanted to soak this album in the way I did with AIC (Tripod) in '95 - just my ears listening from beginning to end. This is a dense album with great harmonies, big choruses and thoughtful lyrics. Overall it is very cinematic with emotional ebbs and flows (and friendly for a long drive or walk with headphones). With each listen I get hooked on some part of a different song and find it sticking with me making the album more enjoyable per listen. This quality of (rock) music and CD packaging is a lost art. Coincidentally, Rush is one of favorite band and Nick R's production on this and Clockwork Angels made for back to back summer soundtracks. Completely awesome.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|A real tear jerker, a great story. What those horses go through in war, they should get a metal for their service as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I like that you can be creative and don't have to follow a story like in other games but I've tried to sign up for realms but no matter what it it won't register I've even tried different emails and its starting to get on my nerves so plz fix this  P.S. I tried this on my iPod and I got the same result.
B0037AGASG|5.0|My granddaughter loves Justin Bieber. She has everything from clothes to cd of him. I got so tired of hearing Baby, baby, baby song, I nearly lost my mind so I bought her some earphones.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down. I started it Sunday morning and finished it early Monday morning. KHALED Hosseini is one of my #1 authors. He writes the story and he is so descriptive it!s like your in the story too. Fantastic!!!!!!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Can't complain about this movie! I thought it was good, but I kinda wish that it was focused more on the Mandarin<br />villain, but he was pretty good as him. Robert Downer Jr. sure can make it work and sure loved how he worked on all of his<br />IRON MAN soldiers to help him out while he doesn't have to do any dirty work for a while.<br /><br />Too bad this looks like it is the end of Iron Man.... but still bring on Tony Stark!<br />=)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very awesome game.  It should win a million dollar contest.  I love this game. It is one of my favorites.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|It's fun and cute. It's not all that challenging, but the price is cool.I don't see how they're going to make money, though, on people wanting the solutions to puzzles when they'll most likely look online.
B000RLHDUM|3.0|This is a fun cat-and-mouse caper, but there are serious plot holes that take serious leaps of faith to ignore.
B000002KHF|5.0|What can I say, the song &#34;Moondance&#34; is so romantic &#60;3<br />I think this is Van Morrison's best album, it's a classic.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is one of the greatest tower defense games there is. And it is highly addicting. Get this great game!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I like Jillian's coaching style a lot and I love that the video is only 20 minutes. I also like that it has multiple levels so that when i feel like it's getting too easy, I can move up a level.
B00821OX98|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is nice because ther are no commercials. Nice way to watch tv shows
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good movie, the book is so much better. I feel like they left a lot of details out. This may make movie two a little more difficult to make.
B00821OX98|5.0|The leads are very strong and believable...for science fiction.  Tom, the lead character really sells all of the stuff he tells his kids.  Very addictive!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i had the game before and its really fun. but now when i just opened it it wont let me play.  :(
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|I wander who wrote the script and how such 2 good actors agreed to take part in this movie.<br />Do not waste your time and money. As a matter of fact I will not recommend to watch it even if it was free!<br />Very often during the movie you wish that someone would explain you what's going on the movie is so unclear.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Who doesn't love supernatural?  Season 7 is awesome and if you like the character Castiel at all, you will love this season.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A well made movie worth watching in the theater, where I saw it, or at home on your screen via Amazon Instant Video.  With all the dime-a-dozen crap movies Hollywood is cranking out these days, this was refreshing to see.  It had depth and originality, providing the audience with stories of life-changing and soul-making significance.  Would someone who likes \\"only action\\" movies with lots of guns and cars like it? Probably not. But read the summary and watch the trailer, and if it piques your interest, I'd definitely recommend that you watch it.<br /><br />And if you're into the deeper mysteries of life, death, family, suffering, survival and liberation, the concepts of illusion,truth, perception and wisdom, you'd like this. Add to it the beautiful cinematography and you may be lost in its beauty as I was, mulling over the meanings of this and that with my friend for hours afterwards. I would buy it for $15  but not for $25. (The 25$ standard for me is industry-changing, movement-causing, classic-in-the-making movies - Shawshank Redemption, Matrix, Star Wars)<br /><br />If you do order it, try to drop the hype you've heard from your mind, including this review - you may not like it after all. I've noticed that when people say a movie is great so much, and then I see it, I am usually disappointed.  Release your expectations for a better movie experience. All the 5 star reviews may have hyped it up too much. I'm just saying it's worth the few bucks to rent it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this show!  Wish it never got cancelled!  Would recommend everyone to watch this show, I absolutely fell in love with it.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Great movie!  Love the blending of this origins story into the current X-Men story lines.  Great dvd to have in your X-Men collection.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Sitting in the Dr. Office I didn't have my tablet but remembered it was an app on my phone, really made the WAIT go much faster.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works great and looks great. I  Have not found any errors and I like the way it displays the history. Although I did erase the history by mistake once by hitting the AC button twice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|one of the best programs that i have downloaded and very useful for study as you can jump back and forth through several versions of the Bible for comparison.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|As real as it gets. Le carre captures human emotions and frailties to perfection. I could read his books continuously.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Lots of nasty zombies.  A zany crew of living people trying to make it to safety.  Twinkies on the horizon.
B006964E8S|4.0|A good plot with believable characters that keeps the reader on the hook until the last 20 pages. John Puller is my sort of guy!
B000059H98|4.0|Slightly silly, B+ grade romp into a future where water is power.  If you like things a little &#34;Out there&#34;, you'll enjoy popcorn and this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This latest book in the Crossfire Series is exactly what avid readers have come to expect. Eva and Gideon continue to struggle thrugh their complicated relationship with lots of passion, jealousy, and all the drama that comes with that combination. However, the end of this novel is beyond disappointing. There is certainly a market for cliffhanger endings and it can offer some certainty for purchases of the next book. In this case, the author chooses NO ending. The book literally ends in the middle of a scene followed by a short blurb from the author saying more to this adventure will come. Seriously? This so called \\"ending\\" is nothing short of lazy and it is inconsiderate to the reader. After months of watching the release date for Entwined With You get pushed further and further back, one can only assume that Sylvia Day was under deadline, stopped writing and turned the manuscript in to her publisher. In turn, the publisher should have sent it back with a note saying \\"Finish it\\". The draw I felt throughout this novel was destroyed when I got to the end...
B0019IMVDG|5.0|i have always loved pesci and deniro and together they make this one of the best mafia movies ever made
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love this book. It made me laugh and cry. I enjoyed the lessons taught about life. Life is not a l ways happy and everyone rich. The book felt like it could be real.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game, unfortunately it's got problem loading to my kindle I hope it's temporary because like I said, it's great fun and I like the strategy in it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A little slow setting up the characters, but definitely worth the wait. Definitely a book with recommending to any action fan.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|After reading this book, you will want more from Sylvia Day.  Obviously, there are still loose threads in book 3 which can't be resolved in just one book.  I love Gideon and Eva and I think in this book, Day justified how they need each other.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00498YZH8|4.0|This is an intense movie.  Gripping, heartbreaking scenes of meth infected rural America.  This movie is well done, has a good story, and the acting is superb.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|I liked the book, but I feel that it could have been better if the images and examples used there would be newer. I mean the information is good, but I feel the book could add more value by today's standards. I know it was published some time ago, but then a 3rd edition should come out.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good read!
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|Cons: This app does not install on android 2.2.<br /><br />Pros: It might have been useful otherwise considering the feature list.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|First I had trouble installing the drivers. I finally did it after several hours of working on it. But It was my fault. Then I had to re-install my windows7.<br /> which was not easy. Finally it works very well. Good choice. Would recommand.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Could be a very nice app but took a HUGE chunk of memory.  Works with 2.2 but slow is a real factor unless you have a LOT of memory.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Brilliant and entertaining. Intelligent and witty. Love this TV show, addictive and great performances by lead actors. I recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|An excellent reader, great features, especially the archiving feature and is fast and easy to use.  Also has display adjustments that come in handy.  Works perfectly on android 2.2.
1400079276|2.0|I placed an order fo a book in very good condition. The book I received was in fair condition due to the ripped cover. Just wanted to note the difference. Book still readable and it is used just different from what was advertised.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It works exactly as advertised and seems useful, but it slowed down the overall startup of my tablet but a lot.  Uninstalled it and the Yahoo one as well.
0425263924|2.0|I'm a huge Sylvia Day, Gideon and Eva fan. I loved the first 2 books and I preordered the 3rd.  I felt like Sylvia failed to tell a story in book 3. I don't want to give anything away so I won't give details but I will say that I felt cheated throughout the entire book. There were a few good moments but even those felt thrown together with little effort. I was 100 pages into the story and felt like nothing was happening. After waiting so long to release the book, this is what you give your loyal fans. The ending of the book felt like Sylvia had an appointment that she didn't want to miss so she simply threw a few words on the page and left. I need closure so I will support the Gideon and Eva story hoping that Sylvia shows compassion for her fans and puts more effort into the next book. Yes....there will be a 4th book. This is NOT a trilogy!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Pros:<br />1.  Relatively fast browser that works well with my older tablet.<br />2.  User configurable settings are easy to access.<br />3.  With java script enabled, it doesn't crash nearly as often as the others I have tried.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any worth mentioning.<br /><br />Free browser, works great w/ 2.2, easy to install and use.
0007270968|2.0|is this a book? is there a real book? I don;t get this, is if for little kids or idiots or something? 83 pages with a very large print size.... just sort of confused about how they can call this a book I guess.
1432794426|5.0|So much has been written about the King of Pop that it is safe to say that literally everyone has an opinion about him.<br />Sadly, too few of the books that were written do justice to this larger-than-life figure of not only music, but human history.<br /><br />Dr. Karen Moriarty's book, of which I've had the honor of receiving a signed copy, shines a new light on Michael Jackson, the entertainer, the philantropist, the symbol, the icon, the man, the father. This book is the most emotional book about MJ that I've ever read. I discovered his heart and soul, I realized that all he ever wanted was to be seen as normal, and all he did, he did in the name of, and for the cause of pure, unchained, child-like love. It is a compelling psychological portrait of a misunderstood visionary, it is a book that needs to be read with tissues at handy. It can be enjoyed by people of all backgrounds, just as Michael Jackson's music, and most of all, it is a LABOR OF LOVE! Read it, it's totally worth it! 10 out of 5!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I enjoy watching this for the strong lead actors and also for the action scenes plus for the wonderful story plots.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great puzzle game!  Hard enough to make you think, not so hard that you lose interest or just give up. You have to keep a sharp eye out for clues and pay attention to details. But it's worth it and the money to buy it. I hope this game maker has more like it, I will definitely be a return customer.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I enjoy a strong female actor lead and I got 3 strong lead actors plus the action fights scenes were exciting to watch. I enjoyed the plots.  The writers did a wonderful job.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG! I couldn't put it down! Love it more then 50 shades! Can't wait to see what happens next book!
B000056BOR|5.0|We did not have this in our Doris Day collection.  We have most all of the movies she made.  Great family viewing.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved it great read! I enjoyed this story greatly! It held me right til the end a great love story of Destiny! The movie was good to!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have been looking forward to this album for a very long time, and Daft Punk does not disappoint. Much more soulful than most EDM out there.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a great app. I love everything Google and this does not disappoint at all.  Would highly recommend it.
B000002C1W|5.0|One of my favorite non Beatle or Eagle songs. Already listen to it about a hundred times and still enjoying that song.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love these dvd's.  I am a huge fan of Castle and it is great to watch them over again.  Love them.
B00000099X|4.0|I have readed from good reliable sources about this vinyl edition:  Isn't the original 1996 LP. Actually, the original vinyl version is too expensive and so difficult to get. However, I believe this attractive yellow vinyl re-edition is not a bad issue if you want to have a nice-price good copy on classic vinyl format of one of the best albums and rock musical works from the end of the last millennium. Definitely TOOL's Aenima is considered today as an essential item for a basic or extensive rock collection and an important several rock genres reference work (alternative, progressive, heavy metal). I met and bought the album on CD in 1996, when it came out, and now I keep listening and enjoying it as if I had never before heard it, and acquire this good, attractive and sound-acceptable LP re-edition is a great and important bonus in my  rising vinyl collection. Highly Recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love to play angry birds.  I'm not a big game player but love Angry Birds.  It is easy and fun!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I'm getting impatient. I've been waiting ever since mojang announced the update coming on June 6th and its now June 11th. My friend got his updated on his kindle Fire HD an  I haven't. I mean it's a good game and all but y'all really need to update faster!!!!!-
B003L77FYS|5.0|I am a huge fan of Castle and love these dvd's.  It is a wonderful series and I love watching the episodes over again.  Highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|There's a fair amount to do to keep one's self amused for a little. Something that doesn't take up a lot of time, and you can keep coming back when you want.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the accuWeather app.  I put it on my homepage of my tablet so I can see what the weather is in my town.  Very easy to use and gives very accurate information.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This games Is awesome it at first looked a little boring then I played it once and I just kept playing and playing
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app and didn't like it.  I am sure it's just me.  I found it to be too confusing so I uninstalled it.
B00B8PMWJI|2.0|I expected more horror and scare, but no, just death and more death, not even good death.<br />Not worth it!
0060005424|5.0|I'm not too sure how well I remember what was in this book vs. the others after reading the whole trilogy in about two weeks but I do know it was great. Never read a fantasy that was as much of a page turner as these books. After reading Sabriel it was nice to learn more about the old kingdom and the Clare. Lovely mix of description and adventure.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with Hazel Grace and Augustus and I fell hard once I came to the realization that I was undeniably going to get hurt. It was an amazing story on life, love, pain and joy. I cried like a little girl and yet felt so hopeful by the end of the book and Augustus last words. Absolutely loved it!
0060528737|5.0|The whole trilogy was awesome. Just the right amount of fantasy so that it still feels real enough to picture being there with the characters. Classified as teen reading, however I think it would be a fabulous read at any age.
B0095P31L6|1.0|I Considered this move to be a rather stupid and pointless movie. I could not recommend it to others at all.
159463176X|3.0|This book was a letdown. It started off very well, with a philisophical story about the grey areas of life; rights and wrongs. I was reading the book, thinking how well Hosseini seems to bring out the unnoticed details and poignancy of day-to-day life and human behaviours. The 'div' story was wonderful, so touching. The Rumi quote was amazing, a glimpse of the story to come.<br /><br />100 pages or so, into the book, the story started shifting timelines. Okay, fine.....after the next 100 pages, it seemed like another writer or even multiple writers had taken control. From there on, the story shifts decades back and forth like gears. Some fillers like the Greek man's story, Roshin's story, etc, were given too much focus.<br /><br />The storyline picks up speed or slows down abruptly, like a newbie driving a car. The ending felt loose, disappointing.<br /><br />There isn't any depth to the numerous characters introduced in the book. Most of them seem highly forgettable, unlike Mariam, Laila, Hassan, Sohrab, Baba or even Assef! I do not know if I would remember the character Pari or Nila.<br /><br />Also, it seems like the author has developed a new style of writing. 'Kite Runner' and 'Splendid Suns' had that exotic Afghan specialty in it. The style was special because it had the author's trademark magic.<br /><br />However, this book tries to be global and chic.....and it fails. What a huge disappointment from one of the finest, most emotional writers of these times.<br /><br />Oh well, who knows - I may read this book again after some months and really like it. After all, one can only like KH's writing, which comes from the heart and aims at the reader's heartstrings.
0425263991|4.0|If you enjoy this series, this is a great addition. However, if you don't have an interest in delving deep into Psy territory, the story line was narrow enough that you can sit this one out and you will be ok with the next one. It was a pivotal book for the story of the Psy, but can be condensed into a spoiler or two explaining what happened if you don't wish to read it. To me, this book wasn't as light as most. Any time the Psy are involved (and both leading characters were Psy in this one!!), I have to try to figure out exactly what's going on and what they're seeing. I guess I'm not meant to be a Psy because sometimes it's frustrating. I must admit that my favorites are the story lines that have Changelings, either without mating bonds or with Psy or humans. That being said, this book had a beginning and an end, but still allowed us to see that there is more to come.  This book, like all of the others in this series, was well-written, exciting, and creative. I agree with some of the reviewers who said it appears there may have been different and/or less editing in this one but other than noticing it wasn't quite as tightly edited, I was not overly distracted. And the ending to this one showed that things are going to be very different for our Psys! I'm looking forward to book 13 - and more Changelings! So read this one if, like me, you're hooked on this amazing series or if you are a huge fan of the Psy, but you'll be ok reading a spoiler or two to prepare you for the next one if you prefer.
B004AFFZNI|4.0|This case should have came with the gopro as default. This case came as described and works well to charge my gopro on the go. The only reason for the four stars was its crazy high price.
B002YCVWXQ|4.0|violent, but very entertaining, with an unexpected twist.  We can only wish that WWII ended according to this plot.  Watch it.
0061743526|2.0|i had received the book in horrible condition. The book was worn out and dirty. it also looks as if its ten years old. i did not like it's condition but i did find the rate of delivery acceptable.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game me and my cousins all play it all the time. I love when they change the themes.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is nice &amp; relaxing.  Good for passing time without any stress or for winding down at the end of the day.  It does, however, load a bit too slowly on my Kindle Fire and it would be more fun if you had to turn the pieces, like when you're doing a real puzzle.  But if it's free, what have you got to lose?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game rocks it is fun to play I am addicted to it. It was the best thing to do.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I order this series because a friend suggested it.  I haven't had the opportunity to view them as of yet but expect to like it based on reviews.<br /><br />Loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|WORKS WELL ENOUGH. SOMETIMES YOU GET BATTERY LIFE READINGS THAT ARE WRONG BUT WITHIN A FEW MINUTES IT WORKS ITS SELF OUT.  THE SCREEN TEMP OPTION IS COOL.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|great tunes and great stories, still among the most-played list on my Ipod.  Wish there was a booklet explaining all the references.  Knopfler has a real knack for making songs out of history.  Makes me want to go and read the bio of Kroc!

B004LWZWGA|5.0|What can I say? I am a Bale fan and love the  Batman series. This does a great job wrapping it all up with some great stars guesting this time around. Highly recommended!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books but now feel as if I was ripped off.  I didn't think this was worth the $9.99 or a total of $50.00 really if I wish to continue to the end of the series.  I just feel like for all the hype that this is better than 50 Shades it really was not.  This book seemed like a filler to stretch out this series to make more money.  If I could I would return this but since I pre-ordered and it was delivered to my kindle and was unable to read it until 6 days later, unable to do so now.  Don't know if I'll ever buy anything written by Sylvia Day again - think she is just trying to cash in on the success of others.  In the end I just feel duped and ripped off (and was totally pissed off since we had to wait almost a year only to find out that this is not the last book in the trilogy as promised)
B004LROUNG|4.0|Well written. Easy to follow.  I was able to put the book away for a few days and pick the story up without having to backtrack
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a Sci-Fi buff and this show definitely fit that bill; lots of action and excitement. The acting on this show is well done, 1st class Sci-Fi. Can't wait for the next season
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Let me start by saying, I've never read the books(s). I watched the movie with fresh eyes not knowing what to expect except that kids were going to die.<br /><br />The quality of the film production was amazing. The story had some \\"flaws\\" that I just couldn't wrap my head around. I could elaborate but I would be revealing some spoilers to those who would still like to watch the movie. Just be prepared for actions taken in the film not only by the kids trying to be the sole winner, but also the people running the games to boost ratings.<br /><br />In all, I'm glad I watched it as now I can tell others I finally did. I'm in no rush to see the sequel if it ever comes out. Did it? I'm also glad it was \\"free\\" to watch with my Amazon Prime subscription.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|Well, I guess it was inevitable. Ever since it became clear that Christopher Nolan was involved in Man Of Steel, there was a high probability Hans Zimmer was going to score the picture. And people, even some of those who absolutely detest his music, gave him the benefit of the doubt because it is widely known that Zimmer is a huge John Williams fan, and hope remained that he would break out of his box somehow and deliver something unique. However, there was one critical obstacle that stood between Hans Zimmer and a great Superman score: Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />When scoring a new film, Zimmer is, as of late, not very shy about letting the world know what his creative process is, which leads to comments about Man Of Steel like this one:<br /><br />\\"And in a funny way, it went from being absolutely, completely intimidated by the baggage of the John Williams tune to being completely liberating by thinking, 'What did he do? Lots of snare drums and trumpets, and it's a fanfare, a very objective thing', so if I start off by taking away some of those things from the palette and create my own, I'm already going to do something different.\\" To which the directors added, in their wisdom \\"But Hans, it's just another movie. Get real!\\"<br /><br />So, off he went, and proceeded to do all these things, take away the snare drums, the trumpets, the fanfare, added the french horns, the droning bass, the horrible synths, a steel pedal guitar ... and proceeded to do exactly the same thing he always does. Gosh, it must feel great to have the director and producers liberate you from the duty of creating anything special. The result is something I can only call one of the most obnoxious scores of Zimmer's carreer.<br /><br />Now, this is a new Superman franchise, you can wipe the sound palette clean, that is a good thing. But the point of wiping a palette clean is to create something new and unique, and not to create music that sounds like a mixture between Dark Knight leftovers and DaVinci Code. He apparently failed to see that by throwing away Williams' music, they threw away a part of Superman's soul that must be replaced. More damning, however, is the fact that even though Superman, even this new one, is a heroic character, Zimmer refuses to infuse the score with any heroic, major-moded undertones. There is not even a trumpet heard anywhere in the score, it's the usual mushy sound of 20 french horns blasting an uninteresting theme. But, Zimmer has a solution for that. He says, we should \\"forget the notes\\". He wanted to create the same kind of unique soundscape for Superman like he did for Batman. If he wanted that, he failed, because both sound absolutely the same - Superman Rises. So, Zimmer went from a two note theme over a one note sound to \\"forget the notes\\". I hope he realises he is a film composer and not a sound designer. If I didn't know better, I would say Zimmer shows signs of delusion.<br /><br />The whole score is full of the same drum patterns, the same string chopping, the same brass farts he always does, paired with some synth effects that sound frightfully old. There, Man Of Steel and Jablonsky's Battleship share some ghastly similarities. When asked about the inspiration for Man Of Steel, Zimmer says: \\"I wanted the epic sound of the fields and farms stretching past the horizon, of the wind humming in the telephone wires.\\"<br />About the tone of the film, he says it's a lot more good-natured and fun than Batman.<br /><br />How anything, note ANYTHING, in Man Of Steel reflects fun, or has to do with the sound of fields and farms, is frankly beyond mortal comprehension.<br />I have always liked Hans Zimmer as a person, he is just a very pleasant guy, but ever since he got more and more mainstream media attention, he manages to do more and more mental masturbation, spouting comments that have nothing, zero, to do with the work he does. When I read interviews of him now, I keep thinking it's either my sanity or his that is deteriorating at mindboggling speed.<br /><br />The music for Man Of Steel is irritating because it's either boring or overbearing, and switches rapidly between the two, so that listening to the whole album at once is more than just a little strain on the ears. The balance of the sound is so off that the much advertised unique drum circle adds nothing to the music and sounds like any other regular percussion churning out Zimmer's monotone rhythms. The apparent main theme sounds like a direct, slightly tweaked, copy of Chevaliers De Sangreal, which becomes very apparent in \\"I Have So Many Questions\\", where you think they accidentally pressed a DaVinci Code track on the CD. In effect there is little to none originality in Man Of Steel, and if you keep \\"Hans' Sketchbook\\", and delete all the rest, you effectively lose nothing worthwhile.<br /><br />All of that being said, should I really blame Hans Zimmer for the dreadful music that was written for Superman? In the end, it was the director and especially the producers who wanted Zimmer, and they knew what they would get.<br />One star for the atrocious music, plus one bonus star for the presentation, which the music really doesn't deserve, and in effect makes the score a chore to listen to.g at mindboggling speed.<br /><br />The music for Man Of Steel is irritating because it's either boring or overbearing, and switches rapidly between the two, so that listening to the whole album at once is more than just a little strain on the ears.

B003TWONOK|5.0|This is a very different story but a good read. One for the hoildays too sit and have a good read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had to read this book for English. It was not like the normal required reading books. I loved it. It makes you look at the world differently.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Nicely implemented solitaire mahjong that I've enjoyed playing. The two things I wish were here are: 1) a screen showing which tiles match for those that match non-identical tiles and 2) alternate tile sets. There are sufficient layouts of varying levels of difficulty to please most everyone.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|We all need this at some point. What else is there to say? Should have been preloaded On the tablet
B000I3UAJ0|1.0|Unlike the others in this movie series, this one starts slow and stays slow.  It's mostly about the music as the story just isn't very engaging. Start with The Wrath of Khan.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game. A lot of fun. For a free game you should get this game. If you love Iron Man you should get this game.
B003PIUALI|2.0|Very dated and at times silly. Since I was never a video games disciple, the emphasis on that aspect of our past culture probably passed me by. I always love watching Robert Preston, but even his talents were somewhat wasted on this movie.
0307346617|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie but since I read the book will probably understand it better. Movies aren't known for the small details
B00902S0IS|3.0|It was interesting to see how I felt about the movie compared to when I first saw it as a teenager. As expected, the old-fashioned special effects and settings elicited more than a few chuckles. Anne Francis is still one of the most beautiful women to ever appear in film.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game takes a while to get the hang of, but once you do, it gets easier. Game is slow going and takes a long time to earn enough coin to build things.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Very disappointed in ending.  It seemed the writer was tired and couldn't come up with anything more interesting to write about.  We kind of figured she ended up with Sam from the previous book.
0679805273|5.0|Oh, the Places You'll Go book arrived in perfect condition and had a quick shipment.  A great price as well.  New mom and baby loved it !
B008OB1QFK|5.0|Love this CD!  &#34;Nothing on Me&#34;  is my new favorite song of his, and &#34;Little Victories&#34; is a fun song.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|I am at a loss as to how \\"reviews\\" of a movie is based on merchandising, late receipts, etc.....basically everything BUT a review of the film itself. Whatever. Wish those reviewers would get focused or Amazon better security on what gets pass the \\"review\\" board. The movie was awesome. It entertained me while I was sick and that is exactly what I wanted. The witches did outstanding...especially Weisz for embodying their sides. Wish we saw more of the monkeys in action though as that had a lot more potential I felt. Glad I purchased to watch over and over again.
B000005Z0G|5.0|I had this CD when it first came out and needed a replacement. I've always enjoyed the flow on this one, more so than his other albums, but that's just me. Keep Ya Head Up has always been my favorite, with Zapp an Roger as the musical background to a track that has always helped get me through some tough days.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I have to say I'm over 47 years old and I love this fun little game!  Simple to play and very addictive.  How far can you go?
B00005AQF7|5.0|After getting the hookup with Dr. Dre, Snoop nails it with his debut solo album. I had this one back when it came out and needed a replacement for this classic. With blends of old school and the (at the time) current West Coast flavor, this album is a must have for anyone who enjoys good rap flow.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is fun for everyone if you like mystery fun and finding. things it is so fun hi people.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Too bad tv changed maxwell to a blond and made the first show out for them to be comedians, didn't care for the beard on King either. Hope it gets better!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|I was introduced to this game by a friend.  Now my husband and I enjoy seeing who can solve each puzzle first.
0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson's works give you a great lift and this collection deserves a place in the home of everyone with a humorous, philosophical, or even cynical life-view. The art-work is naturally superb and reproduction quality is excellent. The introduction by Bill Watterson himself is a revealing read. Long live Calvin and Hobbes!
141694737X|5.0|My kids love this book dearly! It is fun and learning at the same time even at an early age.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|It's a masterful work of cinema and it looks absolutely gorgeous on Blu-Ray. I have not had a chance to delve into the extras.
B0085CMJ5Y|5.0|These deleted scenes are hilarious. I love this movie! I have to watch it again because I was laughing so hard that I missed some lines.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Started reading this book because I have a friend who read it and raved about it so I had to give it a go and I'm not disappointed.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Pretty cool game for all ages. Very easy to learn. My kids love it.<br />Pretty impressive. I'd give four out of five.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Thought Tom Cruise would chose another kind of film beside this one.  it looks like it was filmed in a warehouse.  Special effects were lousy. The acting was not that good--not the way Cruise is in other films--he always makes things exciting but not in this one.  Fake scenery and background sets.  Almost walked out of the theatre on this one.  Waiting for the next Mission Impossible movie or one which Cruise does some real acting.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|As a fan of Susan Boyle I thought this was one of<br />  her best.  The &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; was unique.<br />  The duets with Donnie Osmond were a surprise.<br />  He expanded himself  to a different/higher<br />  level.... just great.  Cute photos included.<br /><br />  Andrew Clay
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for all ages. You will really like it! I love it!!!!!!!!!!! I read Canterwood Crest books an d this book makes me imagine I'm in those books.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I noted the film critics gave this film very good reviews but learned  that it is one of a trilogy that I believe must be watched from the beginning (Before Sunrise) to enjoy, understand and appreciate the full effects of the character's development over a span of years.  Accordingly, I am awaiting the last of the series, Before Midnight.
044024630X|5.0|The book was used and said it was in good condition.  It was perfect!!!  It was impossible to tell that anyone else had ever read it.  I was very happy with the vendor.<br /><br />Thank you so much.

B004AKCME8|5.0|Yep, there are the good idealistic owls and the bad controlling owls, and you'll never guess who wins.....  But the artistry of this picture is like no cartoon you've ever seen.  It's glorious!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you like block worlds and pigs and cows and Chickens and like building houses and defending your self this is the game it may be a little high but its worth it try not to get exploded by creeper or shot by a skeleton or try not to get hit by the zombies try and survive this world or fly in creative
B000CNFC76|5.0|I guess I've watched this film about 3 times in the past few years, and each time I enjoyed it so much that I see the bonus extras again.  A great family film, yet containing deeper psychological elements for the aware mind.  Even if you don't play or like golf, I believe you'll like this film.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Eddie sounds like he is enjoying himself greatly singing and recording this awesome music. I love his new songs, but especially the oldies. I hope he does another!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|NBC's Hannibal is pure perfection.  The cinematography is stunning, the actors are top notch, and an engaging plot leaving you hungry for more.  I honestly cannot believe this a basic cable television series.  It feels like a high quality show that you would see on HBO or Starz (minus the sex, nudity and cursing! I consider that a plus!).  It can be quite graphic, so keep that in mind if you have a weak stomach, (surprisingly graphic for basic cable).<br />This show is simply a must watch.  You will soon be calling yourself a &#34;Fannibal&#34; as I do! ;)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Cannot put it down. Better than the TV show.Going to read the entire series.the book fills I'm the blank spots
B001HMSFFC|5.0|Great plot, awesome acting, usual Sex and the City!! It's a comedy, a drama, and all the usual sex and innuendo.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon has a way of making you feel that they're constantly trying to keep you as a customer, and appreciate that you're using them. This app is just another thing Amazon does better than a lot of others.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book - I cannot begin to tell you.  I re-read the other two books to refresh my memory and prebought the 3rd book so I was ready to read on June 4th!  This book had no real purpose and where it was left was just DUMB.  I will read the other two because i owe it to Gideon and Eva - to see where their story winds up - but it better be good - i want happily ever after.  Corrine needs to take a hike.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book was just as good as all the other stackhouse novels. I would read it again too. I just hate the fact the now the stories are over. They were all great though.
1432794426|5.0|I HAVE READ THIS BOOK 2 TIMES .. I LOVE IT SO MUCH .... SHE REALLY GET IN TO WRITTING ABOUT MJ ... I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I GOT IT .... GOD BLESS YOU.... EVERY MJ FAN SOULD HAVE THIS BOOK ...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book gives you an appreciation for life, and a will to do more, and to be better. Highly recommended.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I didn't realize I had a use for an app like this until I saw it as the FAOTD.  I decided to try it out and, wow, I now use it a lot.  The app may not be totally intuitive in saving or sharing files, but with a little experimenting it's pretty easy to figure out how to use at least the features you probably need.  I find myself using it more often that I realized I would.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Sick of wasting time to find good sci-fi tv shows? Give this one a shot it's not too bad. Was better than I thought it would be.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, fast paced dystopian novel that kept me riveted from beginning to end.  I like Mr. Howey's dive-right-in-approach - he didn't explain everything tediously, but made learning about the environment a natural part of the reading experience. I haven't been reading a lot lately but once I started this I couldn't help but finish it quickly since I couldn't put it down!  I'm already reading Shift, and will eagerly await Dust when I'm done with that.<br /><br />Side note - as a knitter I loved Mr. Howey's attention to knitting detail when it came up, it's obvious that he's either a knitter himself or has one in his life (or just does some phenomenal research).  When he describes the mayor at the beginning of the book doing a long-tail cast on I about fell out of my chair.  :)
1592332803|5.0|Everything I've made so far from this book is Delicious! I wish I could try a new recipe every day. I love to bring my baked goods to work to show my co workers vegan baking is just as great as \\"regular\\" baking.
B000FA675C|4.0|But terribly, terribly inaccurate.  I don't expect accuracy from a fictional work, but the blatant lack thereof on stuff that is easily verifiable gets a star knocked off.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|While each episode seems to stand on it's own quite well, being able to see them in sequence helps. Thanks Prime/Amazon!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|The premise is fantastic and not one that I had seen before.  Neil Gaiman as always is excellent with just the right amount of wit and good old fashioned character development.  Engaging from front to back!
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Excellent quality and great value for money . Some of the old sound quality still remains which gives vintage atmosphere to the cd .
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This game is fun and awesome. I recommend you try it. My brother and I play it all the time.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I rented this film for my boyfriend for his Sociology course.  The movie was in viewable condition on my laptop.  The good thing about the rental was that it was available for 24 hours.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Love the Foo Fighters, and the acoustic version of Everlong! This compilation is some of the best, the best, the best of them.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is an awesome game. I like that it has me thinking what my next move will be.  I Would recommend this game.
B0000D96NW|4.0|After two albums were machine head were experimenting with hip hop and nu metal music, they come back with a slamming thrash metal album. Songs are a little longer and complex with amazing riff after thrash metal riff. Mixing some elements of old albums like burn my eyes and the more things change, while throwing in elements of thrash classic like metallica's master of puppets and pantera's far beyond driven making this a far more unique album. This album changing the road they were on and coasting into metal greatness with the next album being my favorite by them thus far being the blackening. So glad they turned the boat around with the nu metal stuff ( which I like too). But they seem more comfortable doing the epic thrash albums better. And this album is truly that a epic thrash metal album!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It just didn't have the same tone of immediate danger the first two books had. Although I think the author was leading up to the fact that of the leaders of the two factions there was no real difference.
B000001ELR|4.0|After a couple of disappointing albums were kiss were experimenting with concept albums and disco and pop. Kiss come back with a album were they do what kiss do best rock! Some of the heaviest rocking songs of their career. With one of my favorite drummers of all time Eric Carr. Drumming like a madman sounding like gonzo from led zep on steroids causing the band to rock harder even in a heavy metal territory. One of their strongest albums in years and of of the last albums with their makeup for a while. A true classic for and classic rock, heavy metal, or die hard kiss fan!
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy The Great Gatsby soundtrack. My order from Amazon got to my house fast and I enjoyed not having to wait long for its arrival. I'll definitely bring using Amazon again.
B000002JR8|5.0|It's hard to be unique in metal now a days or even back in the nineties. When this album was released in 94 when metal was uncool and grunge ruled the radio and MTV. To everyone's surprised when this album was released it went straight to number one surprising everyone. Just showing critics were wrong and to show how loyal the metal heads were. Saying that this is one of pantera's best, a true metal classic up there with the likes of master of puppets, rust in piece, reign in blood, paranoid, British steel  and some of pantera's own classics cowboys from hell and vulgar display of power. With no radio or tv time, pantera dosent seems to care going into a heavier direction which suits them the best anyway. Some of the bands best performances and dime bags best guitar work yet, while writing some if the sickest and heaviest riffs still sounding fresh today has it did in 94. And also some of Phil's best vocal performance on any album thus far. Just a real truly metal classic for any metal fan or a fan of pantera. It takes you on a hell of a ride and dosent let up till the end!
B008OOYALE|2.0|I kinda like this game but I like dragon vale WAY MORE plus I think in dragonvale the graphics are WAY better
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Deftones always seem to put out stellar albums. Super heavy seven string guitars over soft dark moody melodies never gets old to me. This is by far this best album so far having the best catchy melodies lay over some of the heaviest and darkness material yet, while venturing in no territory. The songs just grab you in this emotional roller coaster ride. Each song has it own unique vibe and mood which each track sounding far more different than the next but some how flowing together nicely. You have the heavy stuff you come to expect from the deftones and the trip hop or sound effects you expect adding to the dark atmosphere. But chinos chorus this time are more catchy and more melodic the just hook you in. The song writing and musicianship is far more better than any other album. Just deftones best by far thus far, can't wait to hear what the next album brings.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I had no idea my Kindle had a camera.  This is wonderful.  I can get snapshots and share, absolutely great.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|Beautiful remastering job with lots of interesting extras.  One that I especially like in this set is the small panel discussion amongst all the writers, hosted by Family Guy creator and Star Trek fan Seth MacFarlane.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is so much fun, but terribly difficult to beat, which is good....keeps you on your toes, so to speak.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I get all the video I can stand. Wish I had wireless at work so I can view when ever I want.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I bought this book because I watch BONES on tv and I wanted to see how it compared to the show. I really enjoyed the book. While the setting and characters were different, Tempe was the same analytical scientist that I was used to. She was able to save the day . I enjoyed this book very much.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I don't understand how to play this game so it makes it harder to play. I just keep trying for the fun of it.
B005HEPN06|5.0|What can I say, I'm a Trekie!!  NG is the best of the Star Trek series.  Never gets old. Hoping for a new TV series some day.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I Have tried to bring it up several times but it won't come up. Now all it is to me is a used space on my home page.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The 1 bad thing is about the updates. I like to play multiplayer with my friends. They have ipads and I have a Kindle. We r not able to play b/c they have updated. I wish minecraft pe updates will come out fastest
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I don't read romance novels.  But for some reason I promised a friend that I would read this one... and I'm glad that I did. First off it needs a good editing- one sentence didn't make sense and occasionally the wrong spelling is used for a word (bear/bare for example.) It's also formulaic and laughably predictable. I didn't care- this is comfort food for the heart.  It doesn't need to break new literary ground or be unpredictable.  It needs to be what it is; a good, simple story well told. The characters are engaging, the sex is steamy but tasteful and I want to move to Pride, Oregon. Much to my surprise I actually found that I want to read the sequel! Who'd a thunk it... Still not sold on the genre, but I am sold on Jill.
1400169224|5.0|This copy has both the stories up to Meg's early marriage, and also the ones where more of the sisters are away from home the latter of which are sometimes published as a second book.  Excellent!<br /><br />We have listened to other books read by excellent actors, and their work has spoiled us, I guess.  The reader in this case is adequate.  Her reading does not get in the way of the story, her voices for the various characters are really fine, and her diction and pace are perfectly adequate.  I will not hesitate to buy the other Alcott books on CD read by this reader, and am just thankful that they are now available.<br /><br />This CD will NOT play on our older CD player, but will play on our newer one.  I guess it has something to do with being formatted to also work somehow with MP3 players?  I am technologically challenged, but my husband is not, and this will not play on our older player
B00177YA1K|5.0|Even my husband who never watches the same movie twice - groaned when I put it in and laughed through the movie.  He wants the guy who plays the bug to win an award. That's saying something about a movie when he sits through without talking or opening a book!
B005LAII08|5.0|Okay, a Princess not ready to get married and live happily ever after, a Mother she could be closer to, this Princess has awesome skills, AND she has a best friend - her horse, Angus.  The movie is about going on an adventure, about the Mother/daughter relationship, it is about doing the right thing - even when it is difficult and hard.  Excellent story.  Did I mention how much I LOVE Angus?  Totally LOVE Angus.  Whinnnnny!
B001HQZJPM|5.0|Drama in the RAiders of the Lost Arc genre. Fantasy, danger and excitement.  Lots of edge of your seat action and love too!  Great for men and women!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I have Hangover 1 and I have seen Hangover 3 So I had to get Hangover 2 so when; Hangover 3 comes out I have the complete set and of course I liked the all three movies...HILARIOUS ALL THREE!!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|it was what I looking for and more, excellent quality, thanks a lot, I am very grateful, finally i have that awesome trilogy
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoy these books. I have read them twice and will probably read them again. You will love them!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was not able to find files on my sd card after I bought a new phone. with ES File Explorer I was able to find them and even thing I forgot I had.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy this app. You can create your own mix of sounds to make the perfect relaxing melody. I made my own mix, set the timer, and I'm out like a light.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I always enjoy G5 games. It helps pass my time and they always have interesting story lines. I will usually pay extra to continue if the cost isn't too much. I recommend this company to everyone. Thank you for the pass time entertainment.
B00821OX98|4.0|Just decided to go back and review incase. I missed something the first, before the season premiere. You always miss something the first time
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Good app it wakes me up in the morning I recommend this app to any body that has a job and I like so my mom don't have to wake me up in the morning.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun! I haven't got it totally figured out yet.  Still pretty funny when he wrecks! Not a bad app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read, from start to finish! It sadly sounds like exactly what would happen, from the bureaucratic smoke screens and impotence to the final push once everyone got their stuff together. Let's hope it remains a work of fiction, and never becomes a peek at the future.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I just want to say that I loved this book.  I love sylvia's writing!  I'm deeply in love with gideon and eva.  This book took me through so many emotions.  I was crying, angry and jumping up and down all in one afternoon.  I think Sylvia has a great plan for these two character and I can't wait to read it.  But i'm deeply disappointed at all the negative reviews she's getting.  I'm a true Eva and Gideon fan!  Anything with them in it I'm down to read.  KEEP IT COMING SYLVIA!!!
B000UJ48WC|5.0|This movie is amazing expecially remastered in bluray. Always a classic in my book. I would highly reccomend adding this to your collection.
B00BX3KZAS|4.0|Just so people don't misinterpret, I enjoyed \\"Are You Dead Yet?,\\" \\"Blooddrunk,\\" and \\"Relentless, Reckless Forever,\\" but those three albums lacked a sense of urgency.  It was as though a great metal band had found a safe formula and decided to stick with it (kind of like Lamb of God's \\"Resolution\\").  I'm not saying that's what happened, that's just how it seemed to me.  They released solid, but ultimately generic metal.  Let me reiterate: I don't think they are bad albums. CoB just seemed to be capable of so much more.<br /><br />I hesitate to call \\"Halo of Blood\\" a return to form; it's more of an amalgamation of their entire catalog.  Listening to it, I heard hints of their neoclassical era, hints of \\"Deathroll\\" (I consider that their transitional album), and hints of AYDY and beyond.  In the end, this album is what AYDY should have been.  That said, here's a breakdown of the tracks:<br /><br />\\"Waste of Skin:\\" 8.5/10  After some muted chords, the main melody kicks in, instantly reminding me of \\"Hate Me!\\" which is definitely not a bad thing.  The verses and solo are more in the vein of something from \\"Blooddrunk,\\" but the rest sounds like a natural progression from the \\"Follow the Reaper\\" era.<br /><br />\\"Halo of Blood:\\" 8/10 Alexi's self-proclaimed favorite song on the album (see the track preview video on their website).  While not my favorite Bodom song by far (that honor goes to \\"Hatebreeder\\"), it's still a good song.  It starts with a very black metal feel, then settles into a riff that is reminiscent of \\"Lil' Bloodred Ridin' Hood.\\" The solo is an all-out shred, and relatively forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Scream for Silence:\\" 10/10 A slower song, but has one of the coolest melodies I've heard from Bodom.  Easily my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Transference:\\" 8/10  Sounds a lot like older Bodom.  The song starts with a simple melody, then builds to a mid-tempo chug. The chorus has a very memorable guitar overlay.<br /><br />\\"Bodom Blue Moon:\\" 8/10 Anothergreat hybrid song.  If one took \\"Bodom Beach Terror\\" and threw in \\"LoBodomy,\\" you'd end up with this song.<br /><br />\\"The Days Are Numbered:\\" 9/10 Sounds like a newer version of \\"Hatebreeder\\" at the beginning. Alexi embraces the classical sound a lot on this song, making it one of the best songs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Dead Man's Hands on You:\\" 6/10  My least favorite on the album.  It's a slow one, but doesn't offer much.  Take \\"Punch Me I Bleed\\" and toss in a dash of \\"Bed of Razorz\\" to get this song.  However, it does have one of the best guitar-keyboard solo tradeoffs on the album.<br /><br />\\"Damaged Beyond Repair:\\" 7/10 Starts off with a Pantera-esque chugging riff, then segues into a relatively generic, if enjoyable song.<br /><br />\\"All Twisted:\\" 9/10 Very reminiscent of \\"Children of Bodom\\" the song at the beginning.  It kicks into a nice melody with good keyboard work accentuating it all.  This song would have fit nicely on \\"Follow the Reaper.\\"<br /><br />\\"One Bottle and a Knee Deep:\\" 8/10  Another song that would fit well on \\"Follow the Reaper.\\"  Strong melody between the guitar and keyboards, and good rhythm as well.  Great way to close the album.<br /><br />\\"Sleeping in my Car:\\" 7/10 This track is only on the digipak as far as I know.  A typical fun Bodom cover.  I really enjoy that they don't take themselves too seriously.  It gives them a more down to earth quality than bands like Slipknot who seem bent solely on selling themselves as \\"evil.\\" The Bodom guys have fun with this one, and it's a fun listen.<br /><br />I know it appears that I spend an inordinate amount of time talking about how each song sounds like an older song, but I mean it purely in the most complimentary sense.  It never feels like a cheap rehash of earlier songs, merely a logical progression from them.  This is a really enjoyable album from a great metal band.  If you want to hear a band combine everything they've ever done into one album, this is the one to buy.  If you're a Bodom fan, you probably bought it already.  For those people, my review will serve merely to reinforce your opinion or incite rancor for interpreting the album differently than you did.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|Powerful. Heartbreaking. Heartwarming.<br />Honestly, I am not a huge fan of either actor but this movie is making me want to change my mind. Great film.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I like it, has lots of action and well worth the watch, check it out! get it! that's all folks!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This was an absorbing movie, plenty good enough to hold my attention. Denzel Washington is a superb actor, and he carries this film. He has to. There isn't much else. It's an overdone plot: [spoiler warning, stop here] alcoholic causes major accident, fights his alcoholism by himself and loses, then has an end-of-movie enlightenment and finally becomes an inspiration to his kid.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I have much respect for this man; more-so now, than before.<br /><br />The presentation was perfect and there are subtitles only when necessary; I would have loved an option for subtitles, though. I would have turned them on for the whole film.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon and thank you Bob!
B00439MV42|5.0|Ours is 8 years old, and he loved all the movies. We enjoyed seeing them again too. There is some language, but other than that these are fun family movies.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read a few critiques and opinions of this last book in the Southern Vampire Mystery Series &#34;Dead Ever After&#34; and it made me hesitate to purchase this, but having stayed up late to finish it last night I can safely say that this book is as good as the rest in the series.  Charlaine Harris is a good writer, at least I enjoy her books and characters and I've read and re-read several of her series, so why would that change? The Harper Connolly series and the Shakespere series are both good reads, with relatable characters and interesting plots, and clearly there are fans of the SVMS because it inspired the HBO TV series True Blood (although &#34;inspired&#34; is about all - HBO really diverges from the books.) If you weren't a fan of this series, or hadn't read all the books, maybe some of the characters and their motivation, or even appearnace, in this book wouldn't make sense or matter to you. There does seem to be a parade of characters from all the previous books but they enter and leave the story in a logical way and the loose ends get tied up. There are the day-to-day descriptions and musings Sookie usually relates, and enough action to keep you turning the pages, or in my case pushing the 'next page' button on my Kindle. I thought I'd read a comment about some surprises, but frankly I felt everything wrapped up pretty much as I'd expected, and as I'd wanted it to, so I've got no complaints. Except I'm sorry the series is finished.  Maybe Charlaine Harris will start a new series though, and that would be great!  I'm ready for the next new character and story.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|The Magic is a wonderful book that truly changes your life.  What a magical way to live.  The daily lessons and gratitude journal have brought me such joy!  Thank you Rhonda Byrne!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is just one of the few books I've read that have actually been able to bring tears to my eyes while still feeling triumphant. It was humorously sad and almost makes me hope that I had cancer. Which is stupid I know but that's just how strong this book is. Highly recommend. It leaves its own scar in this world.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Let's face it, $400 is a lot to spend on a toy, but after thinking it over for many months, I decided to go for it. If there was ever a big and expensive LEGO set that I wanted, it was this one. I was not disappointed, the build was fun and incorporated many scenes from the movies. My set was pre-2010 and so it had boxes marked with plus, minus, circle and triangle symbols, which means that the parts for a particular step might be in any of the boxes. The more recent sets mark the boxes as 1, 2, 3, and 4, which helps to arrange the bags in sequence so the build is easier. My set was missing a few pieces (I've built a lot of LEGO sets and this was my first experience of this) but a call to LEGO quickly solved this problem, and in a short time they shipped replacement parts to me at no charge. All in all a fun experience that every LEGO and Star Wars fan should have!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using a razor mouse for the past year and it finally went poof.  I scoured amazon for what I thought would be the best replacement and I found the Anker.  I bought it even though the price made me skeptical -- and I haven't been disappointed!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great movement<br />2) Weights (I put them all in to make it feel a bit more substantial)<br />3) Drivers add a great deal of customization to the mouse<br /><br />Cons:.<br />1) The ability to customize the light isn't all that impressive (I find all the shades and colors never truly matched my back lit keyboard.<br />2) When i have visitors use my computer they often complain they can't control the mouse because it's too sensitive (not docking the product because I appreciate the sensativity
B00BF11STU|3.0|Well done, but certainly not what I had anticipated from all the reviews and Academy Award hype. Perhaps this is one of those movies you really need to see in a theater.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This set it awesome. So great to pull it out for a girls night or when the husband is gone on a trip and I am left alone without good TV to watch.
B003TU16BA|5.0|Teva footwear are virtually the only things I wear. With the adjustable strapping system, I am able to have a comfortable and supportive piece of gear. This particular sandal is worn daily for both yard work, walking and social events.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Looking forward to listening to this Box Set. Great Price! Great Box Set! ZZ Top is one of the greatest bands of all time. This is a must own for any music lover.
0451232577|5.0|Follett has done a great job incorporating the various interplay of personalities which make up any government and how they affect foreign policy.
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|Great special effects but I faulted it on several levels which is typical for this genre: Wealthy white family vacations in a third-world country oblivious to the poverty that surrounds them .  When tragedy strikes the family is separated and despite the devastation and loss of life amongst the indigenous population they miraculously find each other and survive, which puts a damper on the whole viewer experience.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was laugh out loud funny, hot, unique and couldn't put down, great!  I stayed up til at least 2 am and had to switch devices since I ran out of power just to finish.  The pop culture references are off the chart hilarious.  The main characters have depth, humor and don't always react the way they are expected.  Cannot recommend this book enough.  Hit BUY immediately - you won't be sorry!!!  Worth every penny and twice it.
B007REV4T8|4.0|More serious with little &#34;tongue-in-cheek&#34; innuendo. Since when did Ms. Moneypenny  become a Black action star? A novel twist .
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|The Deluxe Edition is well worth the extra price.  This is one deluxe version definitely worth it.  You get a lot of extra songs not available on the original release.  You also get a live CD.  Both CDs sound amazing and I love the Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, with a twist of blues.  A few of the extra songs feature the Screaming Trees singer.  The DVD is also amazing with a few of their live performances.  Also amazing sound quality.  Mad Season is one of the most under rated bands I think since they only released the one album most people weren't aware of them but it's easily one of the best hidden gems of the 90s.  Layne Staley's vocals are amazing as usual.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Lots of improbable action when a slave becomes an expert marksman with a pistol and rifle with no previous training or experience against hordes of plantation misfits.  Unfortunately, the DVD version eliminates portions of the actual movie . If one had seen the movie on the big screen (theater)  first and then watched the DVD version there are some glaring gaps in the action on DVD.  Scenes showing Foxx choosing his clothing, sunglasses,  weapons,etc. are missing.
0064430170|5.0|i bought this book after seeing this title on a list of books for your toddler, and my 2.5yr old son loves it! it's rather simple, but he is enthralled by it, and he will ask me to read it again and again - in a single night! plus, the illustrations are very well done.<br />i would definitely recommend this for any parents who loves to read to their kids, and are prepared to read it over and over again to them! :)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok so I am completely content with this book as far as the story line goes however, did Sylvia just feel like she didn't want to type anymore? I mean thank God it wasn't a cliffhanger like the last one-but if I have to wait another 8 months for this story to conclude, I will be pissed.
0399226907|5.0|I bought this book for my 2.5 yr old son, and he likes the story! not sure if it's cos of all the food the caterpillar is eating. anyway, definitely worth it to see him enjoy the pictures and story - and the butterfly!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I love my Nikon SB 700. It works perfectly with my Nikon D7000 SLR camera.  It is impressive but not bulky like the SB900.
B009R659L8|4.0|I am still reading and have always enjoyed Ms Clark books. It does have a little slow beginnning but most likely will read faster
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This was a good movie for the whole family.  Surprisingly, there was not one negative comment about the movie in my house.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was confused on either this one or the other book for I wanted just the complete book from beginning to end<br />I have not fininshed this book. Does not hold my interest as other books have for it does flow very easy, maybe to much medical information.
145210655X|5.0|I originally saw some of Jeffrey Brown's fun pictures of what Darth Vader would have been as a dad on-line & laughed, hoping one day I could find them in book form. Star Wars fans will enjoy the inside-jokes, the silliness & dads will really appreciate fatherly-humor. I highly recommend this!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A book that will make you look at children and perhaps your own childhood differently! Even though it's based on pure futuristic fiction, it goes to show how powerful the dreams and hopes we put in our children are. Furthermore it leaves us with the nagging question when we ourselves stopped being kids and turned into \\"the enemy\\" (aka adults).<br /><br />Overall fantastic read, especially on the Kindle. Make sure you read the book before watching the movie. I highly doubt they'll be able to fully do this great novel justice!
B007VUCAVO|2.0|Paid for HD Pro but must have got the Non HD Pro in the download as I get the ads and always ask for the upgrade
B009K86D86|5.0|You will think twice before you put food in your mouth after you watch this film. I know I did.
B00CRQV1TY|4.0|Great rerecordings of old songs with assistance from todays artists.  New song was OK but the old ones were great
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie made me think about what I am eating and feeding my family.  I grew up on a farm and I understand the farming business.  We treated our animals as a part of our family, and I'm disgusted to see how animals are treated now.  When I moved away from home and started buying meat from the store, I thought I was purchasing &#34;bad meat&#34; because it didn't taste good.  I soon realized that the meat you buy in most stores just isn't the same as the meat you get fresh from the farm.  I rarely eat meat now (and wouldn't at all except my husband isn't convinced and he loves his meat).
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Where is the plot, it's all about sex.  Very, very disappointed!  This should of been the final book!  Not surenI will read anymore from this series!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very very good and interesting. Surprised me at the end of the book. I want more....of it. Can't wait to read book number three.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a great movie, I was great how the boys were so grown up.  My son loved the story too, very sad.
B007Y36K46|5.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD transfer or its features.<br /><br />First  of all  this movie is just spectacular visually. Even in this day of CGI miracles this is truly one of the most visually exciting movies of recent years. Even the most jaded fan of CGI will find something to like here. I thought the whole movie was just beautifully done. The exotic, desert-like environment (no doubt shot in the Southwest) of Mars was superbly realized.<br /><br />Other pluses:<br /><br />Strong supporting cast with actors like Mark Strong who excels at playing heavies and courageous bad guys.<br /><br />The ornithopter like flying machines, which ranged from little flitters to bigger battle cruisers, were terrific. A bit like the 'thopters in Dune but more like dragonflies with their glassy wings. Another beautiful special effects job on that.<br /><br />The costumes were another visual feast. I usually don't notice clothing that much but the outfits were just inspired, both men's and women's. It added to the exotic ambience of the Red Planet. It reminded me of the lavish costumes 30 years ago in the Sci Fi movie, Flash Gordon.<br /><br />The 100-mile an hour salamander-like creature who takes a liking to John Carter is a hoot. I want one.<br /><br />An exciting plot with many dramatic twists and turns. I saw some reviews that said the plot was boring. All I can say is stop taking those bong hits while watching a movie, it might improve your attention span.<br /><br />Lots of cool, miscellaneous special effects, such as the energy fields and matrices that appear here and there throughout the movie which were well done and put to good effect.<br /><br />Exciting battle and fight scenes. The humanoids like the 12-foot tall, four-armed Tharps were another plus.<br /><br />I only read one or two of Burroughs's books and that was 45 years ago but I still had a basic knowledge of the story line. I don't know how the Burroughs fans liked it but I thought the movie did justice to his concept of Barsoom (Mars). Overall, a visually stunning, beautiful, and dramatic realization of Burroughs's Mars and a great family movie for a slow Sat. night.ughs fans liked it but I thought the movie did justice to his concept of Barsoom (Mars). Overall, a visually stunning, beautiful, and dramatic realization of Burroughs's Mars and a great family movie for a slow Sat. night.
0425263908|2.0|Too much like 50 Shades, too many similarities.  Didn't bother to read the other books.  50 Shades much better, better story line also.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It really fun and addictive at first but then it kinds gets a lil boring so yeah. If I were a person who had never tried it before I would def. get it.<br /><br />BTW I NO LONGER LIKE TY
0345803485|5.0|I became obsessed with these books.  So awesome.  Story lines great, but makes you want to experiment, and my boyfriend sure did appreciate it!!!

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It is AWESOME my favorite characters is the medic the soldier and the sniper the ninja use to be my favorite but you have to be really and I mean REALLY be quick to kill someone or else they'll see you but so far ninja not bad they say that the gunner does lots of damage but really not lol but ok there is a soldier a gunner a sniper a medic and a ninja you'll have LOT'S of fun with this game oh and gameloft you have done it again if you keep it up you'll probably be the best selling game developer ion kindle fire the world anyone else that thinks this game stinks well look who's talking gameloft fan out
B000QRIGLC|5.0|one of the best books i have read about the navy seals and the personel relationship between the team members..what a great book about what we are fighting for all over the worlg. thank you so very much
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|As near as I can tell, this app only shut down appstore, which rendered most of the apps on my phone unusable. It sent me a few messages saying that I should update the settings, but wouldn't allow me to reconfigure. I mostly got the app to block pop-ups, it didn't do that either. I uninstalled it less than 48 hours later, the only benefit I found for the app is now that it's gone I feel like my phone runs faster.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This series has new footage from other BBC documentaries like Planet Earth and Blue Planet. Great show! I highly recommended it!
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|100's of car crashes and bullets flying around so another simmilar die hard  with a story plot and good twist in the plot... I wanted to give 3.5 but the site did not allow me to give so overall a good  clean family action movie ...
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset was easy to setup and the sound is incredible for both streaming music and playing games. I would recommend this to my friends and family.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|**<br /><br />Sabbath falls victim to the modern tactic of relying on twists and turns and say \\"unexpected\\" use of harmonica's to compensate for true inspiration. Rubin is no help here as he asks them to imitate Planet Caravan on Zeitgeist and other older ideas throughout the album.  They're going down Iron Maiden and others' path of mediocrity and contrived 'brilliance'.<br /><br />This is another problem of producers taking over band's musical direction and insisting they return to a mentality of decades past - to help them relive their childhood partly. Mark Ronson is another producer who does this - incredibly self-absorbed. Rubin seems to think he can be in at the big bang, when all creation occurs, but his approach is to kill creativity or contain it within an artificial lab reconstruction. The Geeks and Hipsters are out in society and bringing their 'attention to details from the past' overkill.<br /><br />I don't even feel like I want to hear this a second time ('Grow on you' proponents, thanks but move on). Watch out ... there will be people just like the Maiden fans whose reasoning comes down to: \\"but but ... Age of Reason, 7 minutes long, it's an epic by definition! How can you not be charmed by serious titles like 'Age of Reason'! or 'When the wild wind blows'!\\" All the standard doom carbon copy riffs all the doom bands do today appear here, but since it's Sabbath, many fans will insist they're magic, best since 78, new Sabbath album, shut up, etc. But Iommi has just never lived up to his glory in all his endeavours since after 1995, from 96's Dep Sessions & 98's Reunion tracks to 2009's Devil you know.<br /><br />Sabbath show their power-tripping side by taking a swipe at people that stand their ground in 'Loner'. A standard accusation against those who see through you, is to label them as nuts or strange. Rich coming from people so ignorant as to praise Prozac (no wonder you have no consciousness Geezer!), and condemn a US govt ... that has not been inpower since 2008. You see images of Rumsfeld when War Pigs plays! Nothing about the TWO successive Orwellian govt's; funny coming from people who wrote of War Pigs. But then like typical celebrities and musicians, Geezer and Tony have no great awareness of the world, they just vainly read a headline or mass media editorial and spout their philosophy - they wrote War Pigs based on anecdotal evidence from GI's, not analysis or introspection. \\"They leave that role to the poor\\" ... deep. Iommi shook Blair's and Prince Charles' hands like they were swell people, and Oz showed up to Bush's white house dinner celebration. Such worldly awareness and working class authenticity from the great poets of our times. And bashing of 'loners' is also bashing people like Bill Ward - who are usually the soul of the party - and get punished for it by 'winners' like coke snorters and reality show participating, near murderers, money grubbing back stabbers, with poor stage performances. Individually and collectively Sabbath have always been uncaring about others, and trying to shift the blame with chicanery in lyrics like these is natural to people of their kind. (This was not a Bill Ward rant - it was about the Sabbath universe and the impact on their direction).<br /><br />Then apart from twists, there are plain generic riffs or recycled ones, something Sabbath wasn't guilty of really before The Devil You Know. There is 'care' given to the album in many positive touches here and there, but again ... the inspiration is not there ...<br /><br />I like the production in a way, even if it is on the tinny processed side. It's better than the glut of overly muddy 'return to 70s' stoner direction or the more obvious 'loud' mixing, which this album has too - drums more affected than vocals. But this one is maybe a little more early 80s.<br /><br />Despite the pro's - Ozzy's good form and Geezer's too, this one is very clinical and soulless.<br /><br />Rewind back to 1995, their last album before a long absence. Even on Forbidden, they had real new music, not borrowed and recycled but inspired ones, and Tony Martin brought original and beautiful melodies to the band. Bottom line is: The songs here don't rise above the level of the POORER songs from older eras, like Immaculate Deception off Cross Purposes or Shock wave from Never Say Die - that last Ozzy era album was better than this. Inspiration ran through all of Sabbath's music for an 18 album run from 1970 to 1995. The idea of choosing 13 over later classics like Nightwing, Over and Over, When Death Calls, Scarlet Pimpernel, Seventh Star, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Falling off the Edge of the World, Born Again, Too Late, Anno Mundi, Odin's Court and their respective albums is laughable to the extreme.<br /><br />I think I'll go play Cross Purposes, Forbidden or Born Again now ...<br /><br />------------<br /><br />DISCLAIMER for the predictable sheep troll: Reviews include criticism and other 'negativity'. The place<br /><br />for praise only is Sabbath's own website, not Amazon. So keep your comments about haters and opinions<br /><br />about the poster's intentions to yourself. If that doesn't satisfy you, you can always go weep on Sharon's<br /><br />shoulder.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Side note: There's three bands that have each been on Amazon bestsellers for about 50 days: Queens of the Stone Age - a Sabbath inspired band is No. 1 while Sabbath is 4! Just one notch ahead of Darius Rucker from flugging Hootie and the Blowfish!! (Edit: positions change hourly - Their No. 1 will probably convince them that they did no wrong. Sigh ... decades of creativity undone by newly found commercial viability.)<br /><br />Perhaps Bill Ward has the last laugh. It's always best to move on in life, while your old friends stay in a rut and imagine they're evolving. The Black Sabbath party is not where the fun is happening.<br /><br/>*<br /><br />**<br /><br />***

B005I6EU48|4.0|I like the case cover.  It looks like a book when lying on the table.  The one thing that needs adjusting is the thickness.  the cover does not lay flat on the kindle.  Maybe in time & wear it will.  Didn't mean to be so picky. But overall it is great.

B0042U94UQ|4.0|this movie came right on time, the packaging was intact, but the plastic around the movie was broken, not sure why.. it was a good price and i also got a promotional code for despicable me 2 for when it comes out in theatres, very nice..

B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Where is the 2D - 3d combo? No sale for us. Half the family will only watch movies in 2D while the other half wants 3D. Then to make matters worse half the family liked the movie and half didn't. I loved most of the movie and want it in 3D, but without a 2D bluray version included, it will have to just sit on the wish list for now.
6305327041|5.0|Such a crazy good movie. I love the fact that there are 4 different directors and they all go in different directions.

B003TTKB5I|5.0|I avoid the &#34;popular&#34; so I didn't watch Grey's Anatomy Season 1 when it first aired.  Too, I'm terrible at remembering what shows are on what nights.  I love that I can binge watch a series.  But the last show of the series made me not want to watch season 2 because Izzie's character went out of character for the sake of a dramatic storyline.

B00AECDDYY|2.0|First day I downloaded this I would have given 5 stars but, the game didn't change. No upgrades, same enemy, and no new content. Each new section just looks different. Same exact game play. Didn't win? Ok next time launch in the other side. No incentive to keep playing. Maybe I expected weapon upgrades or new type of ships I could work to unlock, but not happy. If it were free, I'd have no complaints.<br />I enjoy a challenge when I play games, this game didn't offer that. Playing it on harder difficulty didn't improve ai, just allows the computer to generate good faster. Very lazy design in my opinion.<br /><br />On a technical note. I pay on a kindle fire. Load times are by far the longest out if all my apps. This has been more noticeable lately, as the game frequently crashes to desk top.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|From the very first few scenes I knew I would enjoy watching this movie again and again. And the character workwasexcellent, more than a few were surprises at the end ;)

B005LAJ23A|5.0|Better than season 1 and alot longer. The season finale was a bit on the stale side thought I must say. Even with that said I still went out and pre-ordered season three. I just cant get enough of The Walking Dead.
B002U6CJO2|4.0|The visuals in this movie are pretty good. Not great, sometimes a little distracting and unnecessary. To flop back and forth between animation and CGI is a bit strange, and honestly unexpected. I loved Ghost In The Shell, it was an inquisitive journey into the soul and what it means to be alive, not only for humans, but computers/robots as well. So when I saw there was a Ghost In The Shell 2.0 I jumped at the idea of a sequel. Except...this isn't a sequel. I'm sure that if I had read the entire description I could have gleaned that important bit of information off the text. But I didn't. So essentially, my disappointment comes from my own self. Not a big deal, but a better title would indicate this is not a sequel.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a really good game although I don't know why but my0.6.1 won't update to 0.7.0 other than that really good and can someone help me?
B004LX0DHC|3.0|It is a good read but is not very details. In usual Seth style, it is thought provoking. By many questions are left for the reader to answer and find themselves.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This is an overrated movie with limited entertainment at all.  The plot is contrived and the acting is amateurish.  This movie is not worth your time or money.
1609611543|5.0|My Dr. recommended me to buy this book and I did and am trying to stay wheat free as much as possible.
B008JEJNDE|5.0|Very nice fit and great quality!  My first Crocs has worn out and chewed out by my samoyed so it was time to get a new pair! Very happy with it!
B00821OX98|5.0|This show has it all, drama, suspense, action and romance.  The show immediately grips you with it's believable storyline and action right out of the gate. It makes you not want to miss one episode.
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|This is definitely a John Woo movie. The gorgeous cinematics, the pigeons, the action... It all marries perfectly with Mission: Impossible. Such a great update to the first M:I film, which seems very dated now. Only four years newer, M:I-2 feels decades ahead.
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|love this time period; Josh Brolin was good; sean penn's bad guy character was great.  Always love Emma stone; great cast
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to learn.  Fun to play.  Not complicated but a lot of subtleties keep the game interesting.  Having a great time with it.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|it was good; I liked it.  Action packed. Tom Cruise is ok.  I would recommend it if you like a good action flick
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product you should buy because this game is AWESOME!!  Well that is not just why.. you get mystery boxes, Hoover boards, witch those are cool and you try to collect the letters to to make a word and also you can have different characters by earning all of the money or all of the prizes from the mystery boxes! That is why you should buy this product..!! It probably doesn't sound fun but right as you start you get addicted to the game!! It is really fun!try it right now then you would understand what I am saying....
B006H53KV8|5.0|It reminds me of when I used to listen to her when i was a teenager. I am 75 now. She was my idol and I will never forget trying to emulate  her hairdo, the flip. I badgered my mother into getting me a perm because I had absolutely no curl.  It was a disaster and I ended up giving myself a very bad haircut in reaction and got made fun of at school.  Nevertheless, I absolutely love Doris Day's voice and she puts me into deep relaxation every time.
B008OOYALE|5.0|great game recommend it to people of all ages and it is on the apple app store for ipad ipod and iphone
B000HC2PCM|5.0|Big Merle Haggard fan here. The production quality is very good and so are most of the song selections. I could do without all the duos, but would have really liked &#34;Swingin' Doors&#34; to be included. Still it's a keeper and I play it a lot in my car.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Like so many others writing I was really disappointed to read an entire 3rd book that did little to push the plot forward and seem like a filler book to Book 4 or perhaps the author has simply run out of ideas for this couple.  I have a feeling this is it for me and the Crossfire series as now I don't even know what I should be looking forward to except yet another filler book until the finale in Book 5.  I really loved Eva and Gideon in Book 1, humored Book 2 but was just let down in Book 3.  Such a shame since Book 1 was such a great read.  Certainly not worth the 9.99 spent compared to so many other romantic ebooks that are just as strong if not stronger.  The This Man series is far stronger and even cheaper.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I picked this novel for my bookclub, we love historical novel. I wasn't aware of this happening in the late 1920. I just thought the author ran out of steam at the end. There would have been so much more we could have learned, but overall the book was a very good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Omg I cannot believe that this is final book. I so recommend this series. I had a hard time putting it down to sleep, wanting to know what was going to happen next. Great read!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton.....as everyone knows, has really taken off.  Season 3 was outstanding and disappointing all in one due to storyline, but this cast beats all.....what an ensemble and they all seem to work so well together.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app bought it for my Kindle Fire and it does the job, downloaded it without any problems.  Thoroughly recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I think a little bit more colour and art would make this app absolutely irrisitable and would also make it be more attractive and even more lively when viewed on the screen
B000RZIGSG|5.0|loved it since it came out ,have it on vhs,cd dvd  and lp . lost count how many times I've watched it -never get tired of it ever !!!
B00355L2TU|4.0|Just watched it without working out to see what to expect.<br />She keeps it to just a few basic moves, which is very smart.<br />Some moves she modifies to give balance to abs etc.  Will<br />be working out to it shortly.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|K. Gosselin once again spins an enthralling tale of Afghanistan that is both tragic and uplifting.  Although at times the novel seemed a bit disjointed (perhaps in part because my kindle broke and  I read two other bookseller awaiting a replacement), ultimately it was well worth the effort to get back into it and reacquainted  with the characters.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The best film that we have seen this year. This movie has everything that we like. Action, funny, outstanding characters and actor, and great computer effects.
B0086700CM|5.0|great app!!! The kids love it; graphics are great also. its worth the download! The only thing we would like is ti change the background
B005LAIISU|5.0|We watched this movie over and over. Funny, good story, good music, and excellent images and characters. Sidney our favorite.
B00004W221|5.0|I bought this movie for my 11 year old son because he had just read the book and wanted to see the movie.  It is a wonderful inspiring story.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I love the characters, music and scenery in the movie.  I have liked the little mermaid since I was younger.
B006M3JVD6|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. such an honest and very confronting story! such a brave little girl / young lady.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love the game itself but playing Xbox minecraft I feel like there's nothing, the game needs a bunch more updates
B008BM9L72|3.0|I found these books a little repetetive.... I was expecing so much more from all the hype surrounding these books.
0345803493|5.0|Read book one on a luke and suddenly found myself at the end without the next book close at hand, thank God for Amazon and within the week I was onto book two.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I love it! It was exciting and unexpected. I surprised  and  glad to find out who Sook ended up with.
0345803507|5.0|This book does not disappoint - definitly worth the hype & kept me up too too late til I completed the tale.
159463176X|4.0|\\"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment.\\" -- 1 John 4:18 (NKJV)<br /><br />Regardless of your ultimate view of this book, I think you'll agree that pages 1 through 49 are as well written as anything you've read in a long time. Bravo, Mr. Hosseini! They are a remarkable achievement!!<br /><br />While anyone would envy an author who accomplished so much to open a novel, there's a problem. Readers expect the rest of the book to maintain that remarkably high standard.<br /><br />I believe that Mr. Hosseini has the talent to do so. The plot for this book, its scope, and length make it impossible to do so. You couldn't write War and Peace in many fewer words ... or a Tale of Two Cities. And the Mountains Echoed needs to be two or three times longer to flesh out his plan for the book.<br /><br />Without that length, the book comes across as a series of short stories briefly connected to one or the other of the two siblings in the book's beginning, Abdullah and Pari. Each story is its own morality tale about how we treat other people, including those in our families. Within the whole book there are themes connecting suffering, responsibility, and morality. Some characters adhere to timeless values, at least in parts of their lives, while others talk a good game ... but don't act in accord with their words. The result is a tapestry capturing Afghanistan yesterday and today against a backdrop of humanity over all times.<br /><br />One of the book's major accomplishments is to present some of the most thought-provoking writing I recall about how appearance affects our lives and our behavior. I would love to see Mr. Hosseini return to this subject in future books. He obviously has a deep understanding that can inform us all.<br /><br />But please do write a book next time that's as long as your subject deserves, Mr. Hosseini! We'll read it.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|I haven't read a book like this for ages and it reminded me why I love reading. It was compelling and heart felt, I will certainly look for more of her books
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Felt obliged to write a review after finishing the book. Simply fascinating! &#34;Blood Song&#34; offered everything I love in fantasy and everything was perfectly balanced. All the characters all the story layers are so nicely woven together that I never felt an irritation about some loose ends which often nag throughout other stories.<br />I am not a native English speaker nor very good with expressing my feelings about the book so to sum up those feelings - one of the best fantasy books I read recently!!!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|It is so help full. Get it really. If you don't get this app your loss. It is the best .
0316019984|5.0|This book is Awesome!! I bought 2 of them for 2 different children!! In the mmiddle of the book the Batman section lights up. I just love this book!
B00992CF6W|2.0|We'll I loved mine craft until they added in realms I spent 6 months building my house and people just came in and destroyed it so change it back
0393327345|5.0|Only took me two days to read, I really enjoy the writing style of the author. I watched the movie first so while I was reading, I tried to see how much the movie kept to the book and I would say they did a good job and what they added to the movie really fit to the book. Some parts in the book are more detailed though, I would recommend this book.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I've had this app for a quite long time, then i reset my kindle fire. I went into my cloud to download it again &amp; it wasnt there. So i went to my app store found it &amp; clicked download &amp; it began then said it was unable too. This was my favorite app &amp; now i an unable to find another just like it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is a very fun side scrolling game that reminds me of the old Mario mixed with Paper Mario. The gameplay is smooth and the scenery is great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The updates are super slow and there are no caves but still it is a fun game but i think it should be cheaper because it relly has barly any stuff  but i recamende it . 8{)
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as much as &#34;The Fall of Giants.&#34;  I had trouble relating to the characters and the situations they found themselves in.  They just did not seem to fit comfortably into the story.<br /><br />I did appreciate the historical aspects of the book and felt they were accurate.
B000GCFY0I|2.0|I really tried to like this book but I just could not. I thought the concept was great and I had high hopes but it never went anywhere. I could not even finish it. Very disappointed. I felt the writing was strong and there was a lot if potential I just didn't like like the main character for some reason I didn't buy her as the heroine and I didn't care about her. Made it hard to read.
0307352153|5.0|I am still reading this when I can. I saved starting it till I went on a big trip. I loved it.<br />I would love if not just us introverts read it but all parents, teachers, employers read it. True leaders try to bring out the best in each individual, telling me to talk more isn't the best use of me. Listening when I do talk is.<br />I will give update when I finish.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I'd read several of the other Harry Hole mysteries, and have always found them to be good reads. All the elements that keep us turning the pages of a well-crafted mystery, while pausing Scandinavian-style to consider the psychology, politics, and troubles of human existence. This is one of the best of the series. Without wanting to be a spoiler, I have to say that I worried, near the end, that this may be the last. I hope not! I hope Nesbo manages a Steig-Larsson-style resurrection of our hero with a new installment. But if that doesn't happen, well, thanks, Jo, for a series of great books that may be worth going back now and rereading--particularly since, in the past, I'd made the mistake of reading them out of sequence.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It's a good show that I have on in the background while I sew, iron or do busy work. I like how caring and genuine Alisha is. I also think she present good life skills and portrays a &#34;good wife&#34; appropriately.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I enjoy new and creative programs and this is one of the best.  I watched the origional showing on Tv and want to see it again.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This lil game had me hooked. A great lil thriller adventure that kept my eyes on my kindle. Hope you enjoy as well as I did! Can't wait for the 2nd one!!
B005IQZB14|4.0|An interesting story of challenge and self discovery. While the author's tendency to share everything can get a little tiresome, the journey itself is engrossing  and well  written. Makes you want to hit the trail.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Good story about a cold mean selfish person melting when confronted with love.  He is now a man with purpose.
B00C061HZY|5.0|This is the second LP I buy from amazon, arrived many days earlier than expected, no flaws just perfect. in comparison with my phoenix bankrupt LP that arrived a little bended.
076115678X|5.0|I've had curly hair for over 40 years and finally learned how to get it soft and keep it that way.  While a whole book may seem superfluous, there were some really good tips and ideas.  Definitely recommend it to those that think they can't live with a curly frizzie mess and those that just want a little more control over their curls.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For me This book started a little slow, about half way through<br />I thought no way. If you like mysteries and thrillers you will like this book with<br />The surprise  twists and turns'
B002FOQY2M|5.0|FUN. delivers in this debut album. I originally picked up this after falling in love with &#34;Some Nights&#34;, their second album, and was not disappointed. The theatrics are not as evolved as they are with &#34;Some Nights&#34; but the feel is there and as expected, the lyrics are on point.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I downloaded this app with another weather app on my Kindle Fire and Motorola Android 2 phone, and both apps quit at the same time while the other weather app is still working and sending alerts as they are issued.  I had expected that this one would have been better considering that I have had the program running successfully on my laptop for years, but obviously they aren't having as much luck on other devices.  I ended up having to delete the app because in the end all it was doing was taking up much needed space.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The contemporary James Bond with a dash of Sean Connery thrown into the mix.  Fun to see how this movie made connections to the original movie.  Hopefully we will see Albert Finney again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Again, I installed this app on my Kindle and Android phone, and it works great.  My reason for downloading this app with the other weather app was because it also gives me information on allergy related information.  I live in an area of the country that is subject to mold, tree pollens, grasses, and other outdoor allergens, and no other weather app I have found gives information on Respiratory health like this one.  A definite plus if you suffer from COPD or emphysema like my sister does.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play with my sister we have a blast playing all day because it is a fun and adicting. We play at least 3 hours a day together.
0307279189|5.0|Only because I have very little time to ever read or do anything.... However once it came it I could not put it down! Loved it from start to finish. And everything has already been said about this great book. Everytime I read a part of it I just want to go out and run more.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|Very interesting and unusually captivating movie on how we are all intertwined in our actions no matter where in the world we live.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great app I play it all the time s d it is a really fun game a great game for kids to play
0307155102|5.0|Love this book!!  Bless my sister's heart she really wanted to give up her copy for her nephew but, just couldn't part with it.  I had to get one for him and maybe he won't be able to part with it either (who knows?)  My son LOVES this book too.  It must be an imagination thing for kids, they must pretend they live there in the houses, and they are part of the whole life that's going on there.  Whatever it is, I catch my son reading the book on his bed just like I would see my sister doing when she was younger.  I think it helps with word recognition and seeing things in the book that he may not have seen before.  I thought we had everything covered in his vocabulary however; a bucksaw, monkey wrench, disc harrow and a corn crib were baffling to him.  What a wonderful book for young learners and imaginations.
0316044695|5.0|This book was amazing.  My jaw still drops when I think about it.  I could not put it down, then I sent it to my dad, he had the same reaction--it will make you deeply proud of our armed forces and reinstate your pride in America.  It was a pleasure and a wild rollercoaster to read.  I am grateful that it was recommended to me, because this is NOT the sort of book I would normally pick up (I am a 30 year old female and I love memoirs, but I don't normally go for violence or gory books--and I LOVED this book, it's now one of my all time favorites).  You will not be disappointed if you read this!!
1616550414|5.0|I've been a fan of Zelda since I was child...  I went through all the stages, from getting The Legend of Zelda for NES and getting used to holding in reset before hitting the power to shut off, getting Zelda 2 and being disappointed (though I appreciate it now as an adult), waiting *forever* for A Link to the Past to come out, and well, you get the idea.  This book does a good job in covering the history of Zelda.  It also does a pretty good job at explaining the history and sequence of the game stories (what happened when and where, and in which time line), which I found fascinating.  I think all true fans have there own view of how it all happened, and I can say this one jives nicely with my own.  There are sections on each of the characters, and colorful pictures, and all other kinds of good things that warmed the cockles of my heart.  The manga at the back of the book was pretty cool too, but I consider it a bonus.  I would have bought the book regardless.<br /><br />Now why did I buy 5?  I bought one for myself (a deskcopy), one to keep wrapped up, and three as graduation gifts....they were all received well.<br /><br />It's worth the price for a *true* Zelda fan.  For someone that never played the originals and is more of a modern day Zelda fan, you will also enjoy it, and it might just inspire you to go back and play the originals.<br /><br />Not sure if you're like me, then here: Top 3 Favorite Zeldas (in order, with 2 and 3 being *very* close, and 1 probably on the top due to nostalgia)<br />1. Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past<br />2. Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword<br />3. Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I have all available seasons of this show, and it is laugh-out-loud, fall out of your chair, gut-busting, liquids-may-involuntarily-spew-from-your-nose hilarious.  Absolutely brilliant.  Best TV show in years, I cannot recommend it enough.  A pure joy to watch!  It can magically melt away your crappy day and you'll laugh yourself to tears.  I'd like to personally thank the cast & crew for bringing us this little nugget of pure wonderfulness.
B0048IMZMG|1.0|All her songs seem to be the exact same.  I recently heard that she throws out all attempts at songwriting during the period immediately after her latest album release because she does not want the new CD to sound like the last, but to me every single song sounds exactly the same.  And I hate to break it to her, but although her earliest songs were clearly of the country persuasion, she is fully a pop artist now and should be classified as such.  If she treated herself as a pop artist, I might actually like the songs, but expecting to hear country music and hearing these pop songs turns me away completely.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved this long awaited book.  N. Singh never fails to deliver, & Heart of Obsidian is a prime example of the excellence of her work.  The saga of this fantastical world continues in grand style, with uber heroes/heroines, the end of a world, & a love story for all times.  It also has a somewhat cliffhanger ending, so that, once again, I can't wait until the next installation of this series.  This world and its inhabitants are now until my heart, and I hope N. Singh has many more novels in her.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|The film Life of Pi follows the book very closely with the characters, the adventures, and the author's imagination. Most CGI looked extremely life-like, and the picture technicalities displayed the beauty of our earth as well as the beauty of man's creativity.<br />The disturbing part, however, remains the story and the theme. Self-proclaimed to \\"help you believe in God,\\" Life of Pi shows you what modern adaptations to religion do: reduce it to a feel-good, insubstantial putty. You may get warm fuzzies from the intention of the film, yet you will be left with no concrete idea as to why you are feeling said fuzzies upon further analysis.<br />For me, the story frames religion as an extra force pushing to destroy you, which paradoxically keeps you alive through its trials--in essence, unnecessary work that serves to maintain your sanity and survival. Religion as voracious tiger, island, or--in the book--carnivorous blind man? Some people perhaps subscribe to religion as a necessary evil, though I find that answer untrue and unenlightened.<br />The movie turns into a dark, dragging depression with anecdotes to flash a smile on the viewer's face to keep him/her watching. Overall, the movie extended longer than the book and convinced me that I'd rather drown than consume Yann Martel's religious theory.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|well done for a free game. Thoroughly enjoyable, though the controls can be a little sticky at times. Worth playing!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What a great book. Can't wait for the next one. Hopefully we don't need to wait to long.  Keeping my fingers crossed.
B00957T6X6|3.0|I started reading the first book at my daughter's house and bought the 5-book package assuming it was complete.  It is hard to keep up with the characters, though I have to thank the author for not using duplicate names -- that makes it easier to use the Kindle search feature if one cannot remember who someone is.  However my biggest gripe is that the story does not end after 5 long books and will probably never end.  Some leading characters are left dangling at critical points but I will not keep buying the books unless there is a definite end.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|All of the songs on this album are truly inspiring with shape razor lyrics that cuts through your heart & soul with a million bolts of sensation- excitement.  It sets the mystic tone for dancing, medicating, making love, and lifting ones  gray spirits into orbit.  Bob Marley is truly a gift from heaven.  His music is legendary & timeless.  Everyone should purchase this<br />CD as a collection.  He speaks of love, togetherness, self pride, a state of awareness, respect for humanity in his message & our sense of purpose in life. Simply the  GREATEST!
B000002J03|5.0|If you like Led Zeppelin, you will love this CD. I think it is the best album they ever recorded.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|The new Oxford American dictionary is very help I learn me words every day. It is a good book and kids will learn more.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I'm so glad they finally put their you tube videos on a DVD!  Great cd and DVD combination! Inspiring music!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't care if people say it is a waste of money just because you have to punch a tree to get wood .they must be jelly because they don't have $7 or a device.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this is great for my house since my little ones cant mess up my alarm and i dont have to deal with the snooze button. I love it!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Game great but short wish there was more for the 2 dollars you spend definitely would play more if it were available
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Very exciting, and different aspects each time one plays it.  The skill level required is easy at first, and grows in challenge as one goes along.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is the best game on kindle.I also have minecraft on xbox 360 but both types are awesome.this game is totally Werth the money.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|She sure can sing, and I really enjoyed 90% of the cuts on this disc.  When I need to calm down, I play Corinne.
1469220725|3.0|This is utter BS. Why does it need to carry on? All could have been resolved, yet not one twist was completed only more added and for what? To out do the fifty shades triology? The fact that Eva's parents slept together was just not needed. Brett coming back to wanting Eva overkill. Her mom having a issue that she isn't ready to discuss, useless. Now Cary could have knocked Tat up, really? Wicked annoyed and pissed. I seriously doubt that I even bother with any additional books within this series or from Sylvia Day. Shame on you.
B005FFW46S|3.0|I really enjoy Terry Pratchett's Discworld books, but this one fell a little flat. There were a lot of repetitive monologue in the book that could have been cut down from a page to just a couple sentences. On the other hand, there was a lot less character development than is Pratchett's usual style and less of the inner thoughts and struggles that the characters face. On the whole the book was slower paced and shallower than usual because of this. I was able to finish the book but I don't think I could read it a second time, whereas the other Discworld I can pick up again and again because they were just so good. I would instead recommend someone pick up a book like Guards Guards or Feet of Clay rather than this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing one of the best books that I have read in a long time. GREAT AWESOME BOOK
193700788X|5.0|I love this entire series and am sad that the stories have come to an end!! Book was entertaining and had a satisfying ending to a long journey!!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|well it has all kinds of battles in it. Like you can train all kinds of leafmen and stuff like that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have season one and two on dvd but havent bought the third yet, i am a walking dead GEEK i watch it close to everyday and tomorrows my birthday and im hsving s \\"dont open dead inside\\" cake. I figured id buy this season on my kind
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book...had a lot of action and I can't wait to read the third book!! Really really enjoyed:)
1742200508|5.0|As travel aids go this is very good.<br />Considering the amount of places to see, places to stay and all the different sites or regions that such a small country holds, this book is a mine of information. It would be an excellent resource while planning what to see, where to go, where to stay and how to get there.<br />Very well set out and organized.<br />Maps, need to know, month by month and many more sections of detailed help it will be a great aid to anyone planning a trip to England.<br />It isn't a huge book but is chunky and heavy, so it may not fit in a pocket but shouldn't take up too much room in a bag.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|I eagerly await John Le Carre's books. They are in a league of their own. 'A Delicate Truth' lived up to all my expectations.<br /><br />The writing is, as usual, exquisite, up there with the Booker prize winners. The characters are engaging and brillaintly portrayed without and direct descriptions. The plot is intruiging, not suspenseful,but played out in a series of brilliant epoosodes, so engaging that once I had read the beginning of each I found myself so enjoing it that I had to continue to its end.<br /><br />The incident central to the plot seemed relatively inconsequental in comparison to the earth shattering scenarios that animate most books of this genre, but as it progresses you begin to realise that the real theme of this book is the implictions of the insidious erosion of our civil liberties and the ruthless persecution of whistle blowers made possible by legislation that is ostensibly designed to protect society.<br /><br />This is a book taht will be savoured by those who enjoy modern literature, as well as aficianados of intelligent thrillers.

B005DJREGQ|4.0|The reality of the awkwardness, popularity, conformity, and other issues teens face at this time in their lives is almost too much of a reminder for me.  I like the series, it's fun, and has promise, and if you've attended high school, you will smile and wince at the same time.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I am a fan of the 'Evil Dead' franchise, but I cannot say that it's something I hold in especially high regard - I love the potential of the original, if not most of the actual movie itself. Count the number of cheap, predictable jumpscares. I love elements of the second, but it's a bit of a mess, too - although 'Army of Darkness' it a pleasant watch, energetic and fun.<br /><br />That's the thing though - the original lacked something powerful. I would doodle Ash Williams much more often than I would actually re-watch the film. I felt something waiting to be tapped into, but I seriously doubted that ever happening. And when this 2013 'Evil Dead' was announced, at first I was, like many, pissed. What with the 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Thing', 'Friday the 13th', and 'Fright Night' remakes plopping out one after the other, I had no hopes for a decent film.<br /><br />But I'm not a total idiot. I researched what was going on with it, looked up its credits, and prepared myself for a very unique film. Sure, there seemed to be a lot of controversy over the story in general, and particularly the omission of Ash's character, but in retrospect I think they handled that aspect beautifully. I tried to enter the theater with a neutral opinion, but also with a firm history of the universe.<br /><br />And I was intrigued by what I saw. At some points, the dialogue was atrocious exposition. Elsewhere, it was gorgeous and full of pathos. Some frights were excellent and original, and some simply fizzled out. Interestingly, some of the introduced ideas from past films simply didn't fit into this new world - most notably the voice of the Deadites - Mia sounded terrible. Some homages were clever and subtle (the camerawork), and some actually improved on the original (I thought the rape scene, while not involving a rape tree per se, recreated the terror of forced entry violently and emotionally).<br /><br />If I hadn't read up on anything to do with this film, and had not seen a single trailer, I would have assigned Bruce Campbell's classic role to the new character David, who rose to the heroic position in the latter half of the movie. Then *spoilers, I guess* his death would have been more shocking. I guess that's my fault? If that was intentional, kudos all around for mixing it up.<br /><br />And the gore - oh the gore! The direction on that end did a fantastic job with what it had, relying almost exclusively on disturbing imagery rather than jumpscares. There are still a few, granted, but I rather enjoyed them. The red rain at the climax of the movie was a nice touch, even if the final monster was a bit... lacking. Or maybe I just didn't get it.<br /><br />That's this movie's biggest issue, really. The plot, like the other elements, was choppy. Sometimes it was painfully clear, sometimes I had to ask questions aloud. That entire opening scene seemed unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Walking out, I was impressed by the potential I saw shining through this film. Since I seriously doubt they'll stop here, I'm exited to see how Mia's character evolves, and how this new universe evolves. I have a lurking suspicion that this franchise might go in a very appealing direction... but as of now I'm only speculating through my opinion of a 'first' movie - And I do feel that this is a 'Part One', of sorts.ingle trailer, I would have assigned Bruce Campbell's classic role to the new character David, who rose to the heroic position in the latter half of the movie.

B00C061I3K|5.0|From the beginning, through to the end, Daft Punk means business.  Their fourth studio album truly embraces the *studio*: acoustic, atmospheric, analog instruments bring their conceived sounds to life in classic ways with all the right nuances and grooves.  The variety of styles presented:  progressive rock (&#34;Give Life Back to Music&#34;, &#34;Contact&#34;), disco (&#34;Lose Yourself to Dance&#34;, &#34;Get Lucky&#34;), EDM (&#34;Doin' It Right&#34;), blues (&#34;Within&#34;), big band jazz and theater (&#34;Touch&#34;) proves that Daft Punk can embrace any style they want and know just the sounds that they want.  It's amusing to read some reviewers try to pigeonhole their music into one genre because they cite so many influences in their track &#34;Teachers&#34; from the &#34;Homework&#34; album, and their influences are most evident here.<br /><br />There is a musical and emotional odyssey weaving its way through this album that careful listening reveals.<br /><br />They did not rush this recording, and it was worth it!
B004G6009U|5.0|I love the humor and so enjoy watching this with my granddaughter. It's great that there are movies like this that I enjoy for myself but enjoy more because my granddaughter, who is 7, enjoys watching as well.<br />Flynn is my favorite character.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This novel works on Kindle - no need for notes - sad appalling story but the boy whose story it is refuses to give up though seeing beyond today is often impossible - you hope for a future and you want to get there with him - well enough written but no fifth star because I doubt it will become a classic and last forever.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Good movie, Not sure how historical in all aspects, but like the end where they give continued infomation about Victoris
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It's great how they introduce you to the Doctor early on, so you understand something about what's going on even if you've never seen the original series.
B001JNNDE2|5.0|Maybe not for everyone's humor, but every time I watch it there is something new I catch. My kids, who grew up during this era, love the throw back items and ideas.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this case. I was looking for cases and financially unable to justify some of the name brand alternatives costing a lot more than this one. Positive reviews and a positive price attracted me to AmazonBasics. Additional draws were the Frustration-Free Packaging, and especially the fact it is not covered in well recognisable camera brand-names like other cases. Less to attract the potential thieves.<br /><br />When it arrived I began filling it up with my gear. I have a Canon 1000D with four lenses, and a Speedlite flash. I was easily able to adjust the velcro lining pieces to make suitable sized compartments for everything. Plenty of different sized zip pockets provide space for filters, batteries, a cleaning kit and more. And the case is not filled. I still have room for another couple of lenses, a battery grip and possibly even a second camera body.<br /><br />Very pleased with this level of quality at this price.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|WARNING.  EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE. and so much fun!!!! I start off gonna play one level and play three or more. could use more info on power ups and their best use. lol

B005LAIH4A|5.0|I think I could add &#34;reciting the words to the Lorax end-to-end&#34; to the list of my skills on my resume. Seriously. We watch this thing almost every day. I don't feel like driving a sharp pointy thing in my eye or ear either, which says a lot for a kids movie that I've had to watch every. single. day. for the past few months.<br />So this obviously means my 4-year old loves it. I bet yours would too.
B00BDZV8R0|5.0|I understand that some people think it's just wrong to reinterpret this great music. But I have really enjoyed this album! It gets better with every playing. It makes the music new and fun again. Highly recommended.
B00BY8DNK6|3.0|I had been waiting for along time for this to come out on cd. No doubt Dio was in its prime and the performances are great.  However the guitar is way to faint in this mix. It's a shame because the drums and vocals sound very clear compared to the original VHS audo. Overall it is a bit disappointing.
0525425772|5.0|My son absolutely loves this series and begged me to pre-order the new book.  Came the day after it was released and he was thrilled and is loving reading it!!
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|The Amazon five star system isn't subtly nuanced enough to give good ratings.<br />I gave Alice in Chains three stars for their new release. This is better than that.<br />I gave Church of Misery four stars for Thy Kingdom scum. This isn't as good as that.<br />So that's 3.5 stars then kiddies.<br /><br />So, what's it like? Well three listens in and it's OK. It's obviously Sabbath - would have been a surprise if it didn't - and wonder of wonders Ozzy is in remarkably good voice, I thought he'd be the weak link but No! What is the weak link? The drumming, a (fit) Bill Ward would have given it much more of a Sabbath groove.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of self reference on the album, which would be all the more obvious if it ended as it began, the beginning of \\"End Of the Beginning\\" would be much more of a \\"Black Sabbath\\" rewrite.<br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" is very much a rerun of \\"Planet Caravan\\" which gives Mr Iommi a chance to show off his jazzy licks and provides a bit of relief to what is in the main very much a one paced album.<br />\\"Damaged Soul\\" is the other main departure from plodder (I know Duh Sabs are the DOOMFATHERS but they are also the METALFATHERS and used to rev it up a bit more). When they first came on the scene Sabbath were thought of as a bad Cream rip off. Didn't really hear it myself, but there's certainly a big Bluesy Cream vibe to this one.<br />\\"Dear Father\\" brings my copy of the album to an end and very much ends with the beginning of Sabbath. Things have come full circle. Thank You and Good Night.<br /><br />All in all a GOOD - surprisingly good - but not GREAT album. Oh, and it's mastered too loud too. Not at \\"St. Anger\\" or \\"Vapid Trials\\" levels but it grates after a while.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on Amazon.co.uk and so may not be suitable for Seppoes.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Awesome movie! Fight scenes were epic, especially the one under the bridge. Great twist at the end. See if you agree with me.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|I read the first story in its original publication in Astonishing and never forgot it. Now this marvelous collection is offered. I enjoyed greatly.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|In what had to be one of the longest rollouts for an album's release in memory the so-called \\"comeback\\" LP by Black Sabbath featuring original 'singer' (using that term loosely) finally hits the street. Can't call it the \\"original members\\" because drummer Bill Ward opted out and apparently Vinny Appice wasn't even asked. 3/4 reunion, ok?<br /><br />One's reaction to this album largely rests on three things: 1) How do you feel about Ozzy Osbourne 2) Did you want your favorite band to plagiarize itself? 3) How do you feel about Rick Rubin?<br /><br />The first question is an unavoidable one. Osbourne has been a self parody for nearly 30 years, hitting an all-time low with his insipid reality show. In fairness I need to set aside any personal dislike I have for Ozzy the image and review his efforts on '13' on their own merits. Still, for a guy that became famous as a solo artist from two moderately decent albums and 90% image and myth I should be allowed to take a jab at the cottage industry of Oz. Anyway, on '13' he doesn't sound as awful as one would expect. Based on truly wretched live performances vocally on the band's current tour it's obvious producer Rick Rubin had Ozzy sing his lines incessantly until they rose to the level of mediocrity, which is the best you can get from a 60+ year old rock singer who always had a mediocre, albeit unique and fitting for certain material, voice. What I find hilarious is how the old guy gets praise for not sucking! That's Ozzy and the nature of fandom.<br /><br />Right from the opening \\"End Of The Beginning\\" Ozzy ee-nun-see-ates his verses with snail-paced phrasing. He makes an already eight minute song feel like an hour. Oh yeah six of the album's eight songs are unnecessarily long (more on that later). Quite simply these sound like guide vocals not the finished work. After two verses I found myself thinking. \\"Man, if Ronnie James Dio was singing this could be killer\\" because make no mistake about it- this is vintage style Sabbath doom 'metal' and prog rock. Iommi's riffage is unmistakable and his tone evokes the early 70s for the first time since the band's glory days. But that's part of the problem. It's been written many times that Rubin allegedly played the band's first four brilliant albums to the band and said they needed to sound like that again. Mission accomplished. This album drips with musical references and arrangements of the early days. It's so contrived you'd almost mistake it for a parody. Long songs, doomy tempos, provocative lyrics, etc.<br /><br />Speaking of lyrics the album's boring first single, \\"God Is Dead?\\", is banal to the extreme. Think \\"gloom/doom/tomb\\" rhymes and you get the picture. Speaking of \\"GID\\" this is another in a series of songs that have no business being seven-plus minutes. Clocking in at nearly nine (!) minutes this interminable track takes about six minutes to get to the interesting bit where it switches to uptempo and we are greeted with a classic Iommi riff that continues for the duration. It swings mightily for those three minutes granted but those first six minutes gave me the same feeling I had when watching the Robin Williams movie \\"Toys\\". Crushing dullness. Most songs on this album fail to merit long running times. They're not interesting enough and it just gives too much space for Ozzy to drag the album down and drag it down he does.<br /><br />Even on the \\"faster\\" (barely) songs like \\"Loner\\" Ozzy inspires laughter with his trademark \\"oh yeah!'s\\" and \\"come on now!\\" fillers. At least \\"Loner\\", despite simplistic lyrics (sample \\"He's just a loner/ He does things alone\\"), rocks a little. Again Dio would have elevated this one ten stories.<br /><br />The album does contain two exceptional songs. \\"Zeitgeist\\" with it's bongos, jazzy guitar lines and breezy slowness reminds me of the band's great \\"Planet Caravan\\". Immediately I had to go back and listen a second time to accept this album contained a genuinely good song. It does and even containsone approaching greatness. The bluesy \\"Damaged Soul\\" is the one time the band revisits it's roots and doesn't elicit cringes. The band simmers on this one. Ozzy doesn't venture out of his tiny comfort zone vocally while Iommi wrings every drop out of his guitar strings. There's even an Osbourne harmonica bit just like the old days. This one works because it feels like a loose jam session that Rubin let slip his fussy grips.<br /><br />That brings us to the notorious Rick Rubin, king of compression and loudness behind the board. I don't claim to be an audio expert but there's just something sterile about his productions. Every instrument is crystal clear and all up in your ears. On this one Ozzy's vocals just sound so clinical. While listening I kept picturing Rubin saying to Ozzy: \\"Alright Ozzy, let's do that line again and again and again and....\\" because his singing seems almost programmed. That's the case of this whole album. It's so unashamedly contrived you just don't get lost in the music. Oddly, though, Iommi- the obvious hero on this LP- sounds great throughout the album. Geezer Butler's bass is mixed right too. The drums? Flat sounding and forgettable. It's like they told Brad Wilk \\"Okay, just keep a beat and don't try to get cute buddy!\\".<br /><br />Bottom line: Ozzy fans will call this a masterpiece because it sounds like classic Sabbath and Ozzy can do no wrong. Fans who are now professional critics will rate it high because of their shock that it isn't as terrible as predicted. Those of us that like Black Sabbath but don't exactly consider Ozzy-related projects among our favorites won't be able to overlook the albums many flaws. I blame it on Ozzy first. Rubin second.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I really like tracks 1, 3 & 9. There a re one or a couple of other tracks that listenable as well. The reason I’m not a fan of the rest of the albums is it sounds premanufactured sounding like several other groups in the mainstream media right now.
B005CAAXXM|5.0|Leprous succeeded with Tall Poppy Syndrome in becoming a blossoming progressive metal band with both skill and songwriting abilities. They also had a unique vocalist with a wide range of skills. The only problem was that they weren't as unique as one might like, and hadn't really found their niche yet. This album takes a turn from their prior one and really finds Leprous coming into their own. Most bands have an album which defines their carer and typically changes the trajectory of their musical path; I believe we may look back at Bilateral as that defining album for Leprous.<br /><br />First of all, the album artwork is bizarre. It looks like they've been listening to The Mars Volta recently, and the album is honestly more in that direction musically as well. So, I must say that the artwork fits the music. Leprous has definitely managed to incorporate a more progressive rock style into the songs on this album, and also seems to be having more fun this time around. The group of songs on here are very diverse and because of that, I feel this album needs a track-by-track review.<br /><br />1) Bilateral - Much like Tall Poppy Syndrome, the title track on this album was disappointing for me. I expect a LOT out of title tracks and this is honestly my most skipped track on the whole disc. That's not to say it's a bad song, but it's my personal least favorite on this album. The song opens with a very theatrical chorus preview and then begins the first verse with some odd drum rhythms and some terrific vocals. I think that the chorus of the song is the part that I really am not thrilled by. There's a terrific bridge section with some fun drumming around 2:46. I really enjoy the way the last word of the song is sung. Overall it is not a bad song, but not one I listen to frequently.<br /><br />2) Forced Entry - Wow, this song makes up for the first track and then some! This is a progressive masterpiece - songwriting at its finest. Some strange sounds early on in the song maypuzzle you, but once the chorus hits, you know you're in for something special. Einar Solberg's vocals are incredible throughout the entire song, which is a theme of this whole album actually. He really has stepped up from the last album, which I thought he was very good on. Back to the song: at 2:12 there is an AMAZING drum part (the whole musical break here is just fantastic). The song gets a mo re melodic feel to it after the break and it softens up a bit thanks to the vocalist once again. His voice can be so gentle and calm, then at other times it is harsh and angry. Anyway, after chorus number two, the intensity reaches new heights and from here carries a much heavier feel overall. This is one of those songs that just builds and builds until it hits a huge climax (which Leprous is outstanding at). This song could easily have ended at the 7 minute mark, but no - the huge payoff comes next. Over the next 3 minutes the song turns in a harmonious, beautiful, angry and powerful climax that makes you wish the song would never end. The vocals in here are so strained and painful-sounding at parts. It really adds to the feel of the song. Needless to say, this is one of the best songs on the album (and of Leprous' discography).<br /><br />3) Restless - This song, which has a terrific music video, is very short. Clocking in at just over 3 minutes, it is over much too quickly for its own good. The tune is marvelous, the chorus is odd (the growling is a bit different - I honestly wouldn't have even known what he was saying were it not for the title of the song) but awesome, and the bridge section is great for fans of mosh pits (the whole song is). There is a lot packed into this little package, so don't take it lightly.  Great for a quick listen if you want to rock.<br /><br />4) Thorn - This song begins with a very unique-sounding instrument. It sounds like a horn, or maybe a strange trumpet. It then opens with a light verse and a pounding pre-chorus. The chorus itself isvery poppy and will get stuck in your head for days.  The vocals have some awesome syncopation throughout. The real highlight is the bridge, where the song descends into a delightfully hellish abyss of music. Ihsahn does a guest vocals part here, which adds a real nasty feel to this otherwise lighter song (for Leprous anyway). It couldn't work more perfectly. Between his short parts, a trumpet gives its best Mars Volta impression. Overall, this is an outstanding song with a phenomenal guest appearance by Ihsahn.<br /><br />5) Mb. Indifferentia - Man, where did this come from? This song starts with a creepy piano line over intentional static/popping noises. You may wonder if you're listening to the same CD at first, but you'll find out later in the song that you definitely are. The first verse and chorus are so startlingly quiet and serene. This song really helps me understand their turn towards the softer side in their newest album, Coal. At about the three and a half minute mark, you may think you're listening to a country album momentarily. What a strange, yet gorgeous song. Only Leprous would try this (and succeed). Once you get to 4:40, the song takes a powerful turn and never lets up. The climax is about five and a half minutes in, and man does it pack a punch. Initially I did not like this song a lot, but has grown immensely on me.  I adore this song, and consider it one of the best lighter songs they have in their discography.<br /><br />6) Waste of Air - We now take a 180 degree turn towards essentially death metal. This juxtaposition is alarming and really shows the eclectic nature of the album. Leprous did this on purpose, with great success I think. You never know what's going to come next when you skip to the next track. This song is clearly written with someone who got the writer extremely angry in mind. The title alone should warn you that this song will be aggressive. Lots of harsh vocals await the listener and many interesting guitar effects as well. There's a cool vocal melody that repeats a few times that begins at 3:26 and builds the next time it is sung. There really aren't a lot of vocals overall in this song, as probably half of it is just fast, pulsing music. This is a great song to listen to when angry or exercising, but when it comes down to it, I'm not going to listen to this one as often as the other tracks on here. Definitely a song that can be your favorite or least favorite, depending on your mood.<br /><br />7) Mediocrity Wins - Here is a progressive gem. This song has so many layers to try and digest that you may be confused the first time through. As usual, there is an off-beat feel to this song. The \\"singing\\" in the verse is very different and feels like a chant. Then comes the chorus - man is it awesome. I love the little \\"ah, ah\\" parts in the pre-chorus, along with the awesome bass guitar lines. The chorus really soars, vocally and then we're back to more weird chanting. This time, however, the chanting gets a bit angry in nature. The song really is incredibly catchy once you absorb it and the chorus demands to be sung along with (with your own voooooice). I frequent this song a lot.<br /><br />8) Cryptogenic Desires - Well the title and song length certainly had me intrigued when I first spun this disc. This two minute treasure shows that Leprous can do anything. Poppy, fun, catchy - who thought the words \\"cryptogenic desires\\" could be catchy? This playful song is over before you know it, and you're left wondering what just happened to you. Great rocker with some great screams and an excellent piano line.<br /><br />9) Acquired Taste - I could write about this song all day. It is sincerely one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I do think it's somewhat of an acquired taste, as the title suggests, but it didn't take long for this to grab me. The chorus is so incredibly powerful and the singing performance is one for the ages. The piano is so soft and innocent, but it really hits hard during the choruses. There is some soft singing around 2:45 that leads to an extremely impressive second chorus at 3:15. The best part of this song is from 3:50 to 4:02... man, this part gives me chills every single time I hear it. The notes themselves are ambitiously high, but the way it harmonizes with the melody is just entrancing. This is one of my all time favorite Leprous songs and an underrated song (in my opinion).<br /><br />10) Painful Detour - Any progressive band worth their salt has an epic closer and boy does this album have one! While not quite as intense and sprawling as Forced Entry, this one is much more ethereal and risky. Trumpets, constantly changing tune, soft vocal \\"ahs\\" floating above the music for extended periods of time, strange guitar rhythms, etc. make this the boldest song on the album, and the perfect closer. The chorus makes two brief appearances (although it's not perfectly clear what the chorus is exactly in this oddly structured song), but it's powerful and wondrous when it appears. What an ending to a quirky and masterful piece of art this album is.<br /><br />Overall, this album is nearly perfect. It is very diverse in sound styles, but always holds that Leprous vibe. They take so many different sounds and put them in the blender, with the result being very fresh and unique.  This band continues to use a piano better than any other metal band I've ever heard, and the vocals are starting to rival some of the best metal bands out there. This band has truly risen to the top of the pack, and I believe they will eventually become a force in the metal world. An essential album for any progressive metal fan, this has brought Leprous to the top of my short list of outstanding bands. I will warn you that the album may take a few spins to hit you, but it is such a rewarding experience once it does.  There are only a few moments on the album that I may skip from time to time, but I almost always can listen to this album from top to bottom and enjoy every moment (I've probably heard every song 25+ times without getting even remotely bored of them).  Leprous has carved a unique sound out here that I believe they will build upon for years to come. They have truly found their niche.<br /><br />Album Rating: 9/10<br />Highlights: Forced Entry, Mediocrity Wins, Acquired Taste, Painful Detour
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a must read! All the emotions of two different individuals in two different world is something I have never seen before. Beautiful work
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Not sure that is the appropriate way to title this but it was a little informative. Like she states right away, it's kind of all over the place just like a child would write. I couldn't put it down though.
B00COHAUD4|1.0|Promising and serious at the start, Mama turns melodramatic and loses its way, leading to a contrived and nonsensical conclusion that's totally anticlimactic. For shame, Mr. del Toro. Don't put your name on garbage like this - your own movies have far too much integrity for you to be sponsoring tripe like this. And I had such high hopes!
B009EHDU7U|4.0|When Alan leaves his abode through a window, his life adventure continues. As his incredible new social life takes some less than believable turns, his tale of his life exposes an incredible mix of adventures and relationships. While the theme has parallels with another well known story, Jonasson tells a tale that is fun and makes you laugh out loud. Age may have its problems, but Jonasson makes it seems like you will have a lot more living to do and be less daunted by what may confront you.<br />Just enjoy the read and the anticipation of what could possibly happen next to an old centenarian. Your life may be better for the read.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Great plot twists and acting. Might be a bit tough to watch for anyone who has been depressed or taken meds for the condition, or if the viewer is or ever has been a suicide attemptor or survivor. Just watched it on a plane, and the intensity of certain sequences left me a bit traumatized, and I didn't really know where the movie was going. Then it became a very clever crime drama, which was unexpected, but incredibly well integrated into the plot. A great film about justice having been served to a person that used the stigma of mental illness in a very cold and calculating way. Bravo!
B002XXPNXG|3.0|Very short compared to first and last, but still great dialogue between Hawke and Delpy who are, in this one, as in the other two, fabulous in their roles.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|To fight for life is to fight for love. Truly a great novel and love story. Definitely will read again.
B002XXNSF6|4.0|First of the &#34;Before ***&#34; Linklater movies.  Like the last two, very well done, great dialogue, incredible interaction between Hawke and Delpy.  The latest (&#34;Before Midnight&#34;) was the best, followed by this one, then &#34;Before Sunset&#34;.  Really enjoyed the ways in which the plot lines of each were interwoven with one another.  I think the trilogy will go down as an important and powerful milestone in film.
B005JABU82|3.0|I'm a bit disappointed how bad in shape the box for the gundam came out.<br />It was in poor condition. :[ I'm kind of sad considering I bought this as a gift. hopefully the person who recieves it doesn't mind the box..

B002HUH6I0|5.0|What makes Good to Great an outstanding read is the fact that is not only useful to the eleven mentioned companies in the book, Collins wrote this book for all size companies. Great companies exists everywhere, both service and product companies. This book however, very particularly focuses on those companies that have tripled their market share, and it talks about the culture and mindset change that these companies underwent to become great.<br />Collins wrote Good to Great as a sequel to the book Build to Last, a book that focused on what great companies needed to keep doing to stay dominant. However, Build to Last was not useful to everybody, considering that not everybody is part of a great company. This aroused a question in Collins head, how do companies become great? Based on this question, Collins and his students took on a quest to find answers through extensive research.<br />Ultimately, the team came up with five answers that combined together are believed to transition a good company into a great company: level five leadership, first who then what, confront the brutal facts, hedgehog concept and culture of technology. Significantly, the importance of level five leadership is stretched throughout the entire book, which makes this topic, in my opinion, the most critical factor for companies who made the transition from Good to Great.<br />A level five leader, described by Collins is a highly educated, motivated and humble individual who is willing to make any sacrifice necessary to prosper a company. When describing the differences between a level five and a level four leader, I like to think of them as generals of war. A level five leader can be thought of as a savior. He will lead successfully lead you to war, and when it all seems to be falling apart, a level five leader will come back against all odds and win the war. A level four leader however, is great general, he will lead you to war and he will win many battles, but he will also lead you to defeat. He will not be able come back and save his troops.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is an eye opener. While reading it, I told my husband that I was going to pass it to him after I finished. I am anxious to see what he thinks. I really believe this book can change the game. Thank you in advance Dr. Chapman.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was agood book to encourage and uplift you when you have lost a loved one.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Don't recommend to anyone.  Won't even work on my kindle.  Lousy waste of time. Don't buy it-it doesn't work.  I hope this is now 16 words.  It wasn't worth 16 words!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a awsome game it needs to update faster my kindle fire updates before my s3.<br /><br />Also check out anythingpos on youtube.<br /><br />And join my minecraft clan at rage.minecraft.mod.shivtr.com
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|I don't buy physical media anymore... and this is why. Excellent quality and the Amazon PS3 app has improved 110% since the last update.<br /><br />As for the movie.. you rent this because you liked it or you wanted to share it with somebody who hasn't seen it. Its an experience.. not a movie. ^^
B004SKJTY6|3.0|I was hoping to see the whole movie, but all I was sent was the trailer for the movie. The trailer was very good, and it looks like it's a great movie, so I don't know what happened.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I don't buy physical media anymore... and this is why. Excellent quality and the Amazon PS3 app has improved 110% since the last update.<br /><br />This is what the tv series Touch started out like.. but then turned in to a soap opera.<br /><br />This movie is a great example of watching Chaos evolve in to that &#34;ahhhhhh&#34; moment we all had when we watched The Sixth Sense.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Was exactly what I expected. it was not too tight for my head. My ears did get a little sweaty when gaming for long hours which is normal for all headphones.  Sound is very good and microphone was very clear.
B00CSSUJJY|5.0|I would have to agree with many other reviewers that the Keith Jarrett Trio is the best jazz trio out there with the Brad Mehldau Trio a close second. I've long been a fan of Keith Jarrett and this is one the best albums he's done.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I saw this picture the last 9th in the Nocturna festival in Madrid and I loved it.<br /><br />Despite I'm a big fan of horror films I didn't like too much the previous director's film Insidious, neither the last horror films released in the last years (except Drag me to hell or Sinister maybe). But when I saw this film the other day it reminded me why I loved this kind of films.<br /><br />The only negative point to me could be the conventional of the plot, but in the positive side the technical aspect is great, the sound, photography, direction. Also it has no stupid characters or silly scares, and it has several very tense and creepy scenes.<br /><br />Almost everything works in this very enjoyable film, so I recomend to all of you who love horror films like the classic ones.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This game is challenging especially for your mind. It is challenging &amp; the guess who is not easy to determine. You have to keep playing but it can be costly.<br /><br />It is a challenging game especially for your mind.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Yes, Bill Ward isn't there but according to Ozzy, \\"Bill's demands were really unreasonable.\\" That being said, Brad Wilk did an excellent job on the album!!! The guys are in fine form, and Iommi is still Iommi!!!!<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Loner\\", \\"Age Of Reason\\", and \\"Pariah\\". However, I love them all and I can't wait to see them live again in August!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|At first I had the none premium free version of this app and then I got this one for free from some deal and I love it! I use it every night and it definitely helps me! The free version is great to but the only thing is that the premium has more sound choices which I definitely enjoy :) I would totally at least get the free version if anyone has kindoff a hard time falling asleep, ITS DEFINITLY A USEFUL APP
B003PJ1UWK|5.0|Absolutely loved it!!!! A clean, hilarious movie you can even watch with your family. What a concept. No foul language, no inappropriate behavior, again...WOW. The construction guys and their crew leader were amazingly awesome. Frank was an absolute hoot. The security guy was so stereotypical it  was so on target.Brendon and Brooke were great too(of course), good chemistry.. Ken from \\"Community\\" incredible no matter what he is in. Did  anyone know he is an MD too? Such energy. I love seeing him in anything, as do I love seeing \\"Angela\\" from \\"The Office\\". Those \\"little\\" sitcoms sure are producing very versatile and talented people.The rest of the ensemble was great too. As for the animals talking...I thought the picture communication was just fine. Again, a fun, light-hearted FAMILY movie, no filth, no nasty, no mind numbing and traumatizing storyline. How refreshing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002NNA9N0|1.0|So, I couldn't watch it.  Was able to successfully stream another movie once I gave up on this one.  I'm not a techy, so, don't know why this happens on occasion with Amazon.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Not bad....it was no shawn of the dead, but it wasnt bad. Zombie eats girls boyfriend, zombie falls for girl, girl falls for zombie...all while trying not to get killed by zombie hunters, zombies, and super zombies called bonies, or skinnies. It was original, fun, campy, silly, and had a pretty good soundtrack including the scorpions.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the update is so stupid! you cant turn peaceful mode on! you cant connect games unless both people have an account! the graphics are better but I would rather connect games than have better graghics! I'm so mad!!!!
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This man is a musical legend.  Rod is like a fine wine; he just gets better over the years.  Time is another great album.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Fast and smooth. Keeps track of just about anything that I need while traveling with my kindle fire hd.  Able to keep short and precise lists, or make longer notes on detailed subjects that I do not want to forget.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|You have got to be kidding me... nothing of substance here.  So disappointing and a waste of time and money.  I was anxiously waiting for this to finally be released, but wow, what a stinker it is.  When I turned the page and discovered I was at the end of the book, I couldn't help myself yelling out loud, &#34;No freaking way!&#34;.  I won't even think about the next installment.  Who needs to spend a bazillion dollars?  I am beginning to hate having to buy book after book to finish a story.  I suggest you save your money and skip this one.
B000LTAY1U|1.0|This Watch is not advertised correctly. It is discounted so heavily because it is not an accurate watch. The time slows down throughout the day and the day will switch to Spanish in the evenings. Not worth the purchase. this all happened in 2 days. I wouldn't waste my money on this as it is likely to break after any long term use!
1439153663|5.0|Wonderful, entertaining read. The story is fast paced and you really get into the characters. If you like southern, slave era fiction, you will LOVE this book. Excellent.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Assassinate. You left it there? Now I'll be on pins and needles waiting for the next book in the series.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|This is a good guide book to use as a refresher on how to not just sell, but to persuade.  The book is very good for people who have just entered a sales job or are just looking to be more effective at persuasion in business/philanthropic/social situations.  All of his facts are based on verifiable psychological studies, so there is credence to what he has written.  The book is an easy read (should take you no more than 6-8 hours), but is useful for dog-earing and notating.  Be sure to use this as a &#34;text book&#34; so that you can go back and refresh yourself on the techniques covered.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone said this one sucked but the ending was amazing. I got made at times because I was team Peers, but it all worked out. I definitely recommend it.
B006DHAT5K|1.0|THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES THAT I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR.  IT WAS A WASTE OF 107 MINUTES.
B004SN8Z4S|5.0|i use this shoe for eveything from trail running &bike to my P90X workouts. they fit true to size and are the most comfortable athletic shoe i have ever owned. im on my second pair. i buy whichever color is on sale because they can be pricey.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Fantastic read. Best book I've read in a few years. Cheryl's honestly is refreshing - even when she's dissing herself. Wish I knew her personally.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Fairly well written.  Author is honest about some poor decisions in her life, which is never easy for any of us.  She presented her upbringing, the good, bad and ugly, without using it as an excuse for her adult decisions.  Interesting read for anyone interested in backpacking or anyone trying to take an honest look at their own lives in order to go forward in a more positive way.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|i thought the blue ray contained both the dvd/blue ray and right now my Telivision only has dvd not blue ray ...  i was hoping you would continue to keep an order so i can have both so when i do afford a new TV with blue ray i can play it...  please continue making this available it is so unfair!  pam  :)
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Really like the game and storyline. A big fan of all this type of game but this one is fun to play again and again.
B00881VLCE|1.0|one day I was loving this app and the next day it just freezes and crashes my device, it doesn't matter which device it doesn't matter if I uninstall it and retry it... it's just terrible
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game provides hours of brain teasing. Once you solve one, there are a dozen more that will take you days to complete. This is challenging for days.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|There are FAR better games that do basically the same thing. Not impressed with either the graphics or the game play.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|Einaudi is how I've been dispelling my morning road rage. This music helps make the drive to and from work something I almost look forward to now. The music is calming and helps me center. I absolutely love it and high recommend it for the car to help keep you calm and focused. It will also take the drudgery out of your day.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Super Box Set!!!!  Paul McCartney and Wings at their best!!! Love IT!!!!!<br />Worth Every Cent!!! Keep Em comming Paul, and  Never &#34;let it Be&#34;  Wings Forever!!!
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Taught me about how special life really is and we all need family in our lives. I would share this movie with friends.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Being a hardcore science fiction fan, the idea behind this book seems quite feasible. 4 stars only because it gets a little slow. Else, it has everything - drama, a little romance, thrill and ofcourse science fiction!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I know just another boy meets girl....but cute. This could be a family night movie with popcorn and a soda.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|does exactly what I needed. I wanted something I would be able to write with my finger instead of using that tiny keyboard, and this is perfect. I can even upload to google docs and print copies of list I made to give to others.
0061706620|5.0|...who loves Supernatural and Sam and Dean. I am sure that she enjoyed the book - she hasn't said otherwise
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|Very predictable but entertaining Die Hard Movie. If you like Bruce you'll like this one. Lots of action in this one.
0425263924|2.0|I'm utterly disappointed with not only the lack of content but the ending!?!?! This was supposed to be a trilogy. Now it's not ?!?!? I returned the book and am done with this series. Ridiculous!
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Lots of action, very bloody at times, but Arnold saves the day once more, outnumbered, outgunned but never outsmarted. Arnold to the rescue!!!!
B006MPKE9O|4.0|At times this book was hard to put down.  The story line keeps you interested and the characters are well developed.  Whether it has to do with the translation, the writing style does not always mke it a pleasure to read.
B003X27L9U|5.0|so beautifully written from a childs point of view, this book had me realising how much of life we take for granted, the vulnerability and innocence of a child, and how we should value our life. very emotional
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great app I play it all the time kids play this app because it is a really great game but it has its perm's but it is great
B00499NHLC|5.0|These two are an excellent team.  Story lines are intriguing and there's good humor.  Addictive show to watch.  I also like the BBC take on the way Sherlock sees the world.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Good game. A good way to learn Mahjong. Entertaining, easy to play and very fun. I like the different boards.
B00BF11STU|3.0|takes a little too long to get to the end.<br /><br />in light of the Bengazi revelation, it confirms the inability of this administration to deal with intel on a timely basis.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|This site has been a great networking tool for me.  I've managed to get some good advice on positions to apply for now that I have been laid off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have been waiting for it to come out for kindle fire yesssss it's finally here! please fix the update thing cause every update is late apple throws it like 5 days earlier than amazon does please fix that!!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Really enjoyed this good read that gets to your heart and keeps you interested.  It was also a different storyline
B006M4F67A|3.0|My insomnia is no longer a problem with this game I don't want to<br />Quit. So additive.  Iwould recomend this game to anyone.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I saw Tony Bennett on an episode of Blue bloods and ordered this. Can you believe I had never heard of Tony Bennett before that? how did that happen, where was I ?
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Top Movie, suggest every one watches this masterpiece. well acted and most enjoyable to watch go out and get it now
B00BBW16HW|3.0|It was o-k, I streamed it- based on a true story- it was fun to watch- why do we need so many words for these reviews?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited with baited breath for this novel, now I am positively panting for the next! Well done Ms. Day! Well done!
B002VECMAE|3.0|I got speedy service and the dvd was in great shape.  I was not as excited about the movie as I'd hoped to be,  BUT that is just my taste,  my husband liked it more than I did.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I'm very impressed with this game. Easy to follow; independent and very affordable! The designing your own park is great fun! Graphics &amp; sounds are simply AMAZING! You'll love it! : )
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I don't think I could have taken another Great American Songbook.  Interesting at first, but it got a little boring.  This lp (oops I just dated myself) is awesome.  The lyrics for I'm So Happy, and the second track about his coming to age in spite of &#34;It's the hair, and the clothes, and the nose&#34; are touching.  The record (oops) goes from so happy to so sad.  Autobiographical?  Musically, to here some mandolin acoustic guitar, and even a bit of pipes was refreshing.  Beautiful Morning, the tease we got months ago is also phenomenal<br /><br />Great pics, Rod looks great!  jimi  from USA
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Totally addictive game, but it would crash my Kindle Fire (1st generation) pretty much every other time I played it. Of course, I still tried to keep at it due to how much fun I was having.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I'm on level 161 and I'm still going !! It's not just another coin game. Oh I dropped another coin haha. It's free and entertaining what more do you want.
B00BGICGJ8|3.0|Was a good movie, but was disappointing in comparison to Knocked Up.  Was still a good watch though. Wouldn't watch it again.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Okay this game may not be the most exciting thing but is really a very fun time consuming game in which is worth it for 99 cents so I suggest getting this game because you will not regret it!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Intriguing period drama, very well done, great actors, photography, script and costumes!  Love this series!  Definitely worth taking  time to watch
B0063GORYU|1.0|i hate this game i have no interest or fun playing it.  will not be playing it again.  thank you
B002SSUQFG|2.0|Very precise, great looking watch, wonderful glass back that revealed the beautiful inner-workings of the watch, but it just stopped working after about nine months. I do not believe that the watch was used improperly. Seiko offered to repar it for $95. I would've rated it five stars if it had lasted longer.
B0057XMCLA|4.0|Rented it, not expecting much, just because my daughter is obsessed with dragons and has read the books. Turned out to be a reasonably well made movie with a decent plot. I'd recommend it for families with children as young as 8.
0765325950|5.0|Great conclusion to an Epic series.  You will not be dissappointed except the fact that the series is over now
B00005V9IL|5.0|Funny that this review comes more than 20 years and over a dozen viewings after my first, in VHS format with my now grown children. For its time, The Abyss' special effects were outstanding. They still are. Yes, Cameron does take artistic license with certain scientific realities, but that doesn't detract from a plot that becomes riveting. A sub plot of Bud's having to face crisis after crisis with a wanting-to-be ex-wife adds depth to the story.<br /><br />I give the film 5 stars because of the strength of performance of the cast, and Cameron's ability to mix drama, humor, and suspense throughout the film.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This was a great movie to enjoy on a rainy day at home, it held our interest and made us laugh numerous times.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I know it's a movie, but I really enjoyed learning a little bit about Hitchcock's life. It was all the better being wrapped in a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen this movie a couple times in the theater and knew that i would want to see it again and again....
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Can only be played on facebook---Not interested-- guess they need some more advertising revenue?<br /><br />All good things must come to an end
0525425772|5.0|My grandson and I share these books and we both really enjoy them.  They are so easy to read and the story and life lessons learned from each one is perfect.  I would strongly recommend this serious to ages 7 or 8 to 100!  Just a fun and enjoyable read.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is one of the most emotion inducing games I've played. The simplicity of everything really lets the essence of the story shine, and even if that isn't made totally clear, it still will make you feel. Just beautiful.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Helps me fall asleep and relax.  Love to use it when I'm reading as well. Nothing more to say except it's great!
1423101499|5.0|Its a very good book and all I have to say is that its awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love the Percy Jackson books.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|A little confusing at first. It jumps from one time to another . You have to be really paying  attention names language and by the end it finally explains everything mostly.
B00D3V97DO|5.0|They're Back ! They're Back ! They're Back ! They're Back ! They're Back ! They're Back ! All other Metal bands on your knees and bow to the Masters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down!  By far my favorite book written by Sparks; the right amount of drama and romance.
B00BAYLS1K|3.0|I was excited to receive the blu-ray version of Strictly Ballroom as a gift because I was disappointed at the quality of the DVD played through our blu-ray player on our HDTV. Well, the blu-ray was not much better. The film has not been remastered or digitized - only re-released in the updated format. The film quality is the worst during the low-light scenes such as during the dance competitions. I just wanted to point out to other potential buyers the quality issue.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|VERY disappointed.  WASTE of $9.99<br />no story.  Bad ending with a cliff hanger.<br />Usually enjoy her but will not be tempted again
B004EPZ07K|1.0|my son and I rented on a lark.  couldn't imagine how bad this could be.  they just whipped up a terribly corny and silly back story about the 3600 green lantern guardians (i guess they beat out the blue lamp shades) of the universe.  worst of all we had to wait half the movie for the lantern to actually appear as we're bored to death by the required love interest story...zzzzz.  couldn't have been worse!  horrible villian too!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  A great read.  Christina McKenna affords the reader an in depth view of truths about the never ending sad saga of the Irish.
B00ALKPTFA|4.0|The principles outlined here are simple but not easy. To truly make a difference in your life it's worth reading this book several times
B005974CNA|5.0|Just when Dream Theater's releases started to get repetitive and lacking in reinvention, out comes &#34;A Dramatic Turn of Events&#34; which lives up to its name.  Very powerful album, musically and emotionally.  Seems to be what they've been reaching for but just couldn't quite attain in past releases.  Highly recommended.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I absolutely adored this book. I myself have never been a fan of the whole insta love. I love the slow build of a relationship. The friendship that turns into a crush and finally something more. To me that is the best part of a story. Really getting to know the characters and feel for them. To see the love build and blossom. Anna and the French kiss did not disappoint. I have to admit I was a bit thrown off by the name. It's a tad bit cheesy and makes it sound like a teeny bopper read..don't let it fool you. It has become a favorite that I can always take out and reread when I'm in a funk. &#60;3
1623420148|5.0|Honestly - one of the best books I've ever read!  I can't express how much I loved the story and Drew's thoughts on the situations he was going through.  Funny!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The devastation of a tropical paradise has been done before, in movies like THE HURRICANE (1937), BIRD OF PARADISE (1932), KRAKATOA, EAST OF JAVA (1969) and WHEN TIME RAN OUT (1980). What gives this film so much power, however, is that it is based on the real life Indian Ocean earthquake, and the resulting tsunami that took place on Sunday, December 26, 2004. This is one family's incredible story, superbly directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. Imagine relaxing in a beautiful tropical resort one minute, and having your world turn upside down and turn into a in a liquid hell in a matter of seconds. The resulting struggle for survival and rejoining of the five family members makes for one of the most incredible true adventures ever filmed. By the way, folks, that's REAL WATER you see on screen - not CGI ! Personally, after seeing this superb film,  I believe the Oscars were handed out to the wrong movies-this one should've cleaned up.Highlights on this DVD include commentary, deleted scenes and featurettes.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and easy to use. I play it a lot, but to get keys it's twenty dollars which is to much for a video game.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Got this mic to get some better audio than the onboard mic - it does that well - it seems solidly made and I have already completed one project with it with great results.  It does a great job of capturing audio in a room.  The only caveat, if the room if noisy and you are doing an interview, a wireless lav works better unless you get this mic on a boom
B00B769XB8|1.0|Be forwarned folks: the 3D version of the film is NOT the unrated version. The Blu-ray version IS the unrated version. They fail to mention that in the specs for the 3D package version!
B000RO9VJK|4.0|The narrator and the content are engaging. The author makes some great points that I see exemplified in small businesses on a regular basis. I am studying business, but don't come from a business background and this has provided some ideas that I have leveraged within the small business where I work.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is an awesome album full of passion and personality. You can tell that each song is about something Macklemore feels strongly about. Even Thrift Shop, as silly as it is, is about how he feels about corporate branding, Wing$ expands on that opinion in a more serious tone. Anyway, this album is worth every penny and the fact that he's independent just makes it 100x better.
0307387178|3.0|The author told the story of a young, upper middle class dreamer who had the misfortune to die of hubris and starvation in Alaska  The treatment is compassionate and empathetic as regards Alex/Chris and his journey away from materialism and parental expectations.  This was a young man who wanted to test himself and live in harmony with nature.  Certainly, Chris had reason to feel betrayed and disappointed by his parent's past behavior and poor decisions.  His actions of giving his money to Oxfam may have allowed him to feel morally superior to his less than honorable father. But his behavior of not communicating with his sister and parents during his travels was cruel and showed no great growth of character.  Indeed, Chris may have been as immature as he was idealistic.   The story was well written and kept my attention though I felt it was an apologia for a pampered, priggish youngster who died needlessly of his own hubris.  The author's attempts to prove that Chris died due to various exotic molds and poisons were not credible and have been widely refuted. Simply starving to death is not very heroic. It is simply pathetic.  The great thing about America is that you can live out your dreams, just make sure that they are not really nightmares.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this to keep at the office for my Kindle. Perfect!! So glad I do not have carry my cable to the office.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|I had heard all my geek friends talking about how awesome this movie was. I'll admit, it looked kinda cool and had a quasi-video game theme about it. It was enough to grab my attention. Thats about where it ended for me though. Maybe its because everyone had built this up as a not-to-miss nerds are cool movie. Maybe its because I hadn't ever read the books. Maybe its because my adult mind could no longer grasp the high school nerd dating scene. But this movie, just didn't appeal to me like I had hoped it would. P.S. The movie cements Michael Cera as the king of dweebs, if he wasn't already considered royalty.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|love the series, hate to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for the next installment<br /><br />same could be said for Sue Grafton's books too
B005LAIHHC|5.0|I did not think there would be so many bad reviews for this movie O_o I recently saw it and could NOT stop laughing throughout. Cohen is hilarious and there are a lot of little moments that make this great (A genial nose rub, talk about a splash guard for a torture device (Youll ruin your shirt!), etc.<br /><br />Yes, sure, it is probably offensive and makes jokes about sensitive issues like 9/11 and Bin Laden, but its hilarious all the same (\\"When they shot his double....\\" And to see the look on the American's face when he heard that! The little moments are priceless).<br /><br />I think most of the bad reviews come from people who are too stuck up or sensitive, because Cohen is a joy to watch in this.<br /><br /> The end has a wonderful dialogue comparing a dictatorship to America. Cohen explains all the benefits of a dictatorship, why he doesnt want to give it up for a democracy, because of what you can get away with. A lot of what he says is happening in America already, a very eye opening scene.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Maybe the wrong people have been watching this movie; that may explain all those negative reviews. Gone With the Wind is a masterpiece of a movie, but to me it was boring---it's just not my type of movie. Well, A Good Day to Die Hard is a GREAT action movie and nothing else!!! It's not philosophical, it's not dramatic, it does not have a deep plot, and it may not even make sense. That's okay. But it's FUN !!  Lots of incredible action, gun-fire, car-chases, crashes. It's hard to catch all the details. The plot, as others have opined, is thin, but it keeps the story moving so that the directors can insert more action sequences. Acting is good, too, even though it is mostly (surprise!) of the macho-guy type. A few comical moments are interspersed here and there to add variety. IF YOU ARE AN ACTION MOVIE FAN YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. If you watch this movie for any other reason you will give it a one-star rating. So, be fair to this movie and to yourself and watch Les Miserables instead.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|Before I start, I would like it to be known that I'm a huge fan of Ozzy-era Sabbath, they are rock legends and have released some of the heaviest, darkest and most powerful rock music of all time. I was very excited about this release but unlike many fans, I refuse to give the band a free pass (lets face it, some fans are so desperate for new material they would hail it a masterpiece before even listening to the record).<br /><br />As for me, I didn't hate it, I just found it tedious and in all honesty a bit dull. It doesn't really sound like they're even trying. There's only so many ways you can recycle the riffs to War Pigs, NIB and Black Sabbath before it just gets embarassing. Black Sabbath albums used to be so eclectic and varied, but this is just straight up doom metal, each song blending into the next with no real identity of its own.<br /><br />It isn't completely without merit, Pariah is a decent enough track and Dear Father offers a much needed tempo change, but it's not even close to any of the other Ozzy-era albums. And anybody who says this is better than Never Say Die or Technical Ecstasy is kidding themselves.<br /><br />I think what irks me most is that it could have and should have been so much better. It's not that it isn't good but the whole premise for the album seems so contrived. I blame Rick Rubin for that. You can't and shouldn't even attempt to re-create an older sound. Genuine inspiration doesn't work like that, any songwriter will tell you that. You create what comes naturally to you and you let the muse take you where it wants to go. That's how the old Sabbath albums were created, not with some douchebag producer breathing down their necks telling them how it should sound. If I was Ozzy or Tony I'd be like \\"who the hell are you to tell us how a Sabbath album should sound?\\".<br /><br />I think the results would've been so much better if they had just gone into the studio and created whatever came naturally to them at their age. It probablywouldn't sound anything like Paranoid, Master of Reality or Black Sabbath (album), but then neither did Sabotage or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and they were amongst Sabbath's best work. The best records are never contrived and are usually born out of the artist feeling free to experiment and come up with new ideas. Trying to re-capture past glories is not only an impossible feat, it is also incredibly disingenuous.<br /><br />Ah well. Next...
B000QUUD60|5.0|Cool look at the King rehearsing....the footage  of him pulling up to MGM in one of his famous Cadillacs (him driving!) is awesome, only to be beat by him getting on a double BIKE to bike too lunch......awesome!  The rehearsals show what a perfectionist he was and what amazing musicality he had on every chord, vocal or back up singer-incredible!  The live footage is fantastic of Elvis bantering w/the sell out crowd and really having some great moves and vocals.....also cool to see him PISSED when some mics don t work correctly-the background hotel goings on are cool but would have been more interested in his backstage doings. Couple of great songs-You've lost that Loving feeling is a stand out cover! The fan footage is dated and sweet, but he doesn t seem dated at all! Fun documentary!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first book in this series and was disappointed in the 2nd book - Reflected in you.  Entwined to you was just as disappointing!  I am tired of hearing about how satisfying Eva's sex life was.  We have spent 2.5 books waiting to find out who molested Gideon and it was covered in a single sentence.  Book 2 and 3 easily could have just been a couple of chapters.  If you enjoyed the first book for the sex only then you will be happy with your purchase.  If you want tension, conflict and a story - don't waste your time.  Again the author and publisher are getting greedy and using the success of the first book to sell book 2 and 3. And there was no ending it was if Sylvia hit her word count for the book and submitted it to the publisher.<br /><br />I wish I could be as satisfied as Eva is with this book, but I'm not.
B00004T0UT|5.0|Absolute MUST for any serious Elvis fan-the raw emotion in his vocals is incredible-the songs cover everything from smokin hot sexi blues to contemp covers and I can t say enough good things about the remastered sound-*****
B00865P3AS|4.0|This is easy listening music and I enjoy it for a change of pace... much better than country and pleased!!!
B003Y5RLR8|4.0|I was excited to see this award winning doc, but was sad to see Elvis portrayed so poorly at obv a exhausted time in his life & touring schedule.....he seems bewildered, pale, sweaty and sad......I know it s part of the &#34;story&#34; but I feel the producers took advantage as so many did w/this generous genious......the fan footage is truly fun, though, th e excitement he generated is obvious, the crowds go wild!!! I truly hope he found more peace than shown here in this context. The song choices are terrible and show him in a very unflattering light.....it actually made me sad.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I purchased the video as part of my collection after the singer died.  There are no glitches or any other viewing issues.  It is a good movie-probably one of her best.  I highly recommend owning it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cant put it down I got it today and have not been able to do any thing else. love this game
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|I love Josh Groban, only love 1 songs on this CD thou. Came with a scratch and 1 song is ruined.
1452110581|4.0|I first saw this when I took TheKittyWithNoName (aka DevilKitty) to the vet. While I was waitiing around I picked this book up and read the first couple of pages.Very amusing! Not fall-out-of-your-chair funny but it did make me smile, even chuckle. I'm not really into the cloyingly cute nor am i one of those crazy &#34;cat people&#34; that collect all things &#34;cat&#34; or dresses up DevilKitty. This book will appeal to those who just own a cat and to those that are owned by their cat(s). The poetry is witty and well written and it's full of cute and odd photos of kittens and cats in various poses. It makes a nice gift for cat lovers and cat cynics.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What an awesome continuation to the story and to know there will be more coming is extraordinary.i can't wait to see what happens next for Gideon and Eva and totally surprised they went for the next step in their relationship, I hope they are able to conquer all of their ghosts.
B000SXLG1Q|5.0|Coldplay is one of my favorite bands and this record captures the raw energy and connection the band has with its fans. Chris Martin is dynamic and the overall musicianship is excellent!
B005UBNKWO|1.0|I purchased this product because I figured it was time for an upgrade, soo I did my research watched a few unboxings and compared prices with other CPUs. The picture shows a box, and naturally I assumed i would get the box with all of the contents inside. Instead i got a little plastic container with the chip inside on top of a little pink styrofoam square.  Is this normal? Or did I miss something in the description?<br /><br />I guess I should have known considering that the first picture for this item is a 4-core. O_O
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Now I finally see why my friends are so excited about this show.  It was great to be able to watch a whole season in one week!  Sound and audio quality were great and streaming was seamless.  Love my Prime membership.
0205313426|5.0|It make the process to make a paper easy. I like it, because I can make a better paper like a good writer
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have tried alot of battery app and this one is great I have been very happy with the simplicity
B00B22IJXK|4.0|This is a great little app that enables you all kinds of different tools for editing photos fast and easy while on the go!
B00B4804KS|5.0|This Twenty year old classic is heart-stopping INCREDIBLE THREE DIMENIONAL EXHERBANCE as you are really inside the crushed tourist vehicle along side the screaming children as the huge teeth of the Tyrannosaurus Rex digs inside to pierce its young terrified prey. The realism in this finely crafted piece of visual magic simply overwhelms one's senses.<br />  The film is followed by an interesting documentary of how the movie was converted to such an incredible 3D experience.<br />David Hammond
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Wow did this game take the gaming world (and eventually mobile gaming world) by surprise when it was released! I cannot recommend this game highly enough, STOP what you are doing and play it now!
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|Gets rid of those annoying ads. Works exactly as described. Highly recommended. No other app does what this one does.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Wow, this game sure makes you think sometimes or should I say think backwards? Quell is a whole lot of fun and unlike most mobile games you feel like you accomplished something after many of the levels.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is the type of HOG game I prefer! I love the mini puzzles and the story line is not as cheesy as some of the other HOGs. I would recommend it for sure. It's a nice way to pass time!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|There's a lot of action, & some of the plot devices were surprising but some were very obvious. I enjoyed the book , so I gave it 4 stars, but I knew who was the bad one from the moment that character appeared. Perhaps I have read too many of these type books! Still, I enjoyed Robie & the other participants, & I like how it was paced. I have another Baldacci to read, & I am sure i will like that book as well.
