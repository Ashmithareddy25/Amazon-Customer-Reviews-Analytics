B00669ONXE|5|Amazing detail and coloring took some minor altering to fit but would do it 10x over, very happy!!!!!!!! great quality
B000CNHDJQ|5|Bought this for my 2002 GMC Sierra 4.3 V6. Instal was really easy once I got the old one off, and the sound is wonderful. Not too loud, but its not quiet thats for sure, all without that annoying cabin drone. If I had to do it again, I would have gone with an H-pipe, but seeing as this was my first mod ever, I have no regrets. Love it.
B00FAJOZTS|5|Great quailty and well built. Works just as the video showed.
B00GGRDCJC|5|love this product to show our support for our U.S. soldiers. always show support to your soldiers,they give more in life than anyone
B000I4JPZE|5|I bought this as I didn't want to have to carry a floor jack to change tire/wheels on my 16' enclosed trailer. I tested it to see if it was strong enough and it worked like a charm.
B00IY2CR3E|5|It works like it is suppose to work.
B00E8053DW|5|Luved gave as gifts to friends at work.
B00H29M5OQ|1|This fan has NO where near the CFM flow stated. As a replacement for another 14&#34; (but OEM) fan, with A/C on, below 30 mph in typical summer day (~90F) water temp will rapidly over heat (in 1-3 minutes). Below 40 MPH you can NOT use your A/C. A total waste of my time and money !! Product description is FALSE and MISLEADING. OK only if you're a Canadian or an Eskimo..
B000C947WQ|3|Had to goof with it a lot and buy more tube to make it work. Doesn't really fit well for the 2005 Impala LS w/6 cyl. that I purchased it for.<br /><br />It arrived in a reasonable time frame. And in good condition.<br /><br />Just wish it actually fit right out of the box.
B0055DPFY8|5|Works great looks great. Just what I was looking for.
B000RNU43I|3|The hitch arrived in a box that wasn't labeled as Reese and had a Uhaul product number on the box. The hitch itself, however, had the Reese logo on it, which I found strange. The finish wasn't great in some places and some of the welds were a little sloppy. My main gripe with this hitch, however, was that the left side mounting bracket was not aligned properly and didn't line up with the mounting holes on the frame of my Frontier. I had to mount the right side, then have someone use a pry bar to bend the left side while I forced the bolts in to the frame. Works fine once mounted, but the quality control at Reese is really slipping - some of the other reviews mention similar problems. It looks good, which is one plus. It would be too much of a pain to return, so I just decided to stick with it. If I had to do it over, I'd go with the Curt hitch.
B008VJXWMA|3|good for the price but had to modify to fit the bike!! Had to bend them to fit the holes, also no instructions were included,but not really neccessary! After bending to fit they were good
B00AXXEL5Y|5|Love the dish! Push button automatic sets itself up in two minutes, HD channels, no rain fade.
B000H8VYXM|5|looks great on the car
B0068G2BTS|3|its look like an basic product.<br />It was arrived at indicated time.<br />Good price<br />its ok but i was expect best product
B004HX72XO|4|Love that big goofy smile! The flag isn't the strongest fagric wise. It will last with light to medium motoring without the fabric tearing.
B0007VNZMM|4|good bumper for the price. I did not purchase the brackets as my the originals  were still good. I did, however, have to align, mark, and drill an additional hole to mount the bumper with the existing bracket.
B000FUNZF2|5|i use only royal purple for my vehicles, so imagine my excitement when i found that they make it for gun parts! the oil arrived promptly and was well packaged to protect it from damage. the oil is absolutely wonderful compared to the others i have used in the past. the only issue i had with the oil is that it was a little runny as compared to my other oils. i will definitely recommend this oil.
B007OFNE3O|5|Great material.  Not cheap.  Bought it for my husband and he likes the quality.  Will order again.  Have a good day.
B003UTH088|5|This fob saved me about $75 - what else is there to say? I bought a &#34;new&#34; car last month and the ONLY downside was that the previous owner lost the key fob. Since my car has remote start as well as a remote trunk and back glass, it really bummed me out not to have the fob. Not to mention the simple convenience of locking and unlocking without the key in the actual lock (I know, whiny first world problems!). When I checked the auto parts store, they did not carry the ones with remote start - and those were $70 alone! The dealership fobs which did have remote start were over $100. I (of course) turned to Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find this. It arrived quickly and the instructions were so simple to find - they were 3rd in line of my internet search. It did die after a week or so, but I replaced the battery and it's worked great ever since.
B000WOAOBO|5|Bought a set in hopes of curing the tiring steering fight. They work so well that I will wear these out and replace with the same item. Very good answer to making the older sled's ride ability worth it.
B0052XNOIA|5|Took a few minutes to install (if that).  Comes with instructions.  No tools required.
B001AT1F6S|1|after only 6 months of use the switch did not work and could not be repaired. Of course amazon would not back the product return,
B004GDLCH2|5|Perfect handle and good price
B00SQFKNUS|4|Very well made, easy to assemble.  Heavy, 240 lbs, with hitch.  I had to use the lowest setting for my 4x4 GMC 2500 HD.  I was not able to install the support bracket due to the frame siting on the bed.  I will be installing camper tape to the frame, front and back.  If your head unit has only one adjustment bolt immediately contact Demco to send you the replacement guides with 2 adjustment bolts on each side.  With only 1 bolt my hitch would not line up even with the 1621 Lippert kingpin box and was cantered 10 degrees.  Will be testing soon with the alignment brackets.
B000IYNUJ6|5|Drop in replacement for my 04 Acura TL at a great price.
B009LOO1DS|5|Perfect fit and match there is no difference between the replace my and the original equipment part. Thanks rock auto!
B00BI2APMW|5|Used this to get around some of the other shop scanners not liking Hondas. Works great.
B0083JLGOE|5|My dad absolutely loved this as a gift when I told him he was going to be a grandpa. He thought it was custom made because it is made so well. I'm so glad I found this. It's such a sweet gift to give a grandpa.
B002MW710Q|5|Fit my 2008 Mazdaspeed 3 perfectly. A pain in the ass to instalI (i would seriously recommend hiring someone to do it).
B0045SQWNM|1|Bought this for my wife's CRV as Christmas gift. Once the Spring season hit and the weather got warm, the glue holding the cover to the retractable roll lost its adhesion, and the cover disconnected from the roll. I tried to re-adhere the cover, which worked a little, but as soon as another hot day came cover disconnected again and again. As we went through Summer it has only gotten worse. My wife is not happy with it, and needless to say neither am I. A huge waste of money and a Christmas gift. Now I will be forking out more cash for the factory cover, but at least it will work.
B00RUQFFPC|5|excellent
B003M4OAY8|5|Great Price! Great Shipping - How can you beat free! Great Quality - it was actually better than factory! Because it had a metal starting gear!  Bolted right up and works flawlessly!
B000FW61SI|4|Using on passenger side of a 2007 Elantra. One clip slighty interfears with mirror but mirror is still plenty usuable. Sometimes it could be a little darker. Wife and son both appreciate it.
B00JIEX722|1|Garbage.  1 dead, and 1 flickers constantly.
B00ARVO62U|5|Great exhaust for the price.  Had muffler shop install for $200.  Everything looks clean and neat
B007BWW9VS|5|It worked out fine. Good quality. Not as easy to install, but managed to do it myself in no time.
B002VEX208|5|Works great, had a little bit of a struggle getting the tensioning bolt threaded back into the alternator body (not sure if this new part is very slightly smaller or not) it could be anything really though.  It kept hitting the side of the sliding slot. If you know what I mean and you have this problem, we finally solved it by NOT bolting the alternator in place with the main top bolt, let the alternator float loosely so you can manipulate in and thread the tensioning bolt in.  Once you have it threaded in several turns, then you can re-attach the top main mounting bolt and finish up everything. (hope this makes sense).<br /><br />This part is perfectly fine, works great.
B00DQ4VZ5G|5|•For safety reasons, never use the tray while driving.<br /><br />So, because the other reviewer &#34;tried&#34; to be funny (and I say &#34;try&#34; with definite air quotes), a perfectly usable product that DOES warn against driving while using gets a bad one star rap.  Bravo there, genius.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product if you eat in your car (especially if you're trying to avoid sitting next to people like the other reviewer in a restaurant while they make up phony reviews for Amazon).<br /><br />FIVE STARS
B001TNDS10|4|This product made a HUGE difference in towing our 5th wheel.  So much better than installing air bags for extra support.
B00DWUOYRK|5|stickers are fun. even more so when theyre about guns. every family should have firepower in their home and on teir back window!
B004LX3AS6|1|I bought 8 of these and 6 of them have stopped working after a 3 months of light use...
B009GYWJ64|5|Grandson loved the shirt
B000CE9O2E|5|Sounds great.. not obnoxious at all, no cab noise except when you really mash the gas. Nice roar even with the factory resonators still in. Gained HP/torque and fuel milage. Getting 24 mpg with k&n air filter and muffler.
B00EHIPTCK|5|Great product works like it should
B000C9SR90|5|My fuel pump Sings Loud some times so time to get a new one with a fuel filter to, for a another week end project
B000C8ZARS|5|Perfect fit shipped fast
B000C5SG54|5|Installed it and within 3 run cycles, the check engine light came off. Excellent OEM replacement part and the cheapest I could find online.  Same product at local auto parts store was a little over 2x more money!
B00BQWQN8E|1|Bought these lights as I've always used Philips brand bulbs in my vehicles.  They have always lasted quite a while for the past 15 years of auto ownership getting about 2 years or so out of them before they would die out.  I was surprised to find that one of the bulbs died out after only six months of use.  The return period for Amazon had expired so I emailed Philips to see if they would stand behind the brand that I have come to know and trust.  After a few weeks of going back and forth with them on the issue of my defective bulb, they determined that my bulb was not an X-Treme Vision (XVS2) bulb but rather a Long Life (LL) bulb as displayed in the photo.  I did point out to Philips' customer service the irony of me getting a long life bulb with this order instead of the XVS2 bulb and it only lasted a quarter of the normal life of previous bulbs.  They continued to describe how they no longer distribute the LL bulb and they can't do anything until I send them a photo of a XVS2 labeled bulb.  Being as the only bulb that I have is the one that came from this order, I could not send them a photo of a bulb that I don't have.  With that, they decided that they no longer want my loyalty to their brand.  If you're looking for a bulb that is made by a company that will stand behind their product, I would suggest that you look elsewhere.  I will be running from all Philips products in the future based on them not standing behind their product.
B009G7OL7G|5|I thought this was only for one cleat, but it's for TWO cleats.  The cleats are as well built as any other brand.  You get two for half the price of one cleat of the other brands.
B001KS6FPA|4|I ordered this for my Honda Odyssey and it fits perfectly.  I've had it for a while now and it seems to have held up well. I probably won't need to replace it again for quite some time.
B00I28WJDS|5|My v-8 1995 Ford is getting 22 miles to the gallon. That is up from 15 miles per gallon highway. In town 18  and 15 before n1...so I better about 3 to 5 miles. I will take more mileage check to confirm. But the power is really something. It actually doesn't strain like it use to. I step on it and it gets up and goes. Always before it jugged down and then strained to recover.
B000EVYGZA|5|Great!
B00IQWHJVM|5|Look great on the cruze
B002ZTPMXO|1|Will this fit a 1998 vw Beatle
B001BSAXFM|1|It makes more of a mess than it cleans. The straw breaks and sheds all over my car interior. Blah!
B00062YNIW|5|Perfect fit for my Meyers Manx and way better than the Taiwan junk I was using. Washable so after off road adventures cleaning is simple and easy.
B003AG11PY|4|I really wanted this for my motorcycle but it is too heavy to install on the plastic fender of my Honda VTX 1300 Retro.  Boy, do I feel dumb.  I didn't know the fender was plastic until I scheduled the installation.  I had a similar hood ornament on my 1999 Honda ACE Tourer which had a steel fender.  Back it went, and I'm disappointed.
B00317JHBC|5|Works great and a good value.
B000CSGT1Y|5|These are great filters. Use them on my '08 V-Star 650.
B001PYSU8O|5|Just what i ordered as was in the picture, no problems and i was very pleased with item that i ordered
B00332GN80|3|This is the 2nd install I have used Wade products, and I like the grade of plastic they use. It has a good smokey shade to it, and they feel durable. I don't think the double sided sticky is worth a damn seeing the surface you're applying it to is velvet. I had one piece that didn't stick at all, but because the pieces are lodged in pretty good, I am not too worried about it falling out. I do worry that the edge that fits into the track is too thick, and will prematurely burn a motor out.<br />All in all, it is way better IMO to put these in a track, than to stick it to the paint of my vehicle.<br />The in track type just look cleaner, and these are good looking when installed.
B003N01UWQ|5|If you are on the fence about getting one of these, buy it now. It's minimal cost for such a big improvement inside your helm. After installing this product I noticed a dramatic difference with the amount of fog forming on the inside of the shield. It cut the fog by at least half if not more. Once more some would think it would be annoying against the face/nose and I can tell you its not at all. The material is really light and flexable and one ride with it in and you'll not even notice it being in the helm. If fogs an annoyance for you (and who doesnt that annoy?) then spend the money and buy this.
B004UBHRWO|4|Neat!
B001DKO3X6|5|Works well!
B00AKA6Q5S|5|I need a filter wrench to fit k&n filter for 02 crv.  Fits perfectly, is 68mm/14-flute exact.  Well built to last forever............
B000C41B4I|5|see 18-4181
B0064GVQZ2|5|I am so glad I bought this Armrest. I had previously no space on my compartment gloves to fit all I have and this Console came as a very handy. It was two steps to set it up and install it. Very sturdy and strong, obviously I don't lean all my weight on it. The idea is to have extra storage and does the job perfectly. It matches perfectly with my car interior colors and seats. Great buy. Super happy.<br />Definitely recomend for someone who needs one.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Purposely drained batteries of my tacoma and eclipse. This little bugger brought it back to life.
B00064331I|5|Purchased two for cleaning bikes.. 1 for the drive train and the other for the frame.<br /><br />gets rid of caked on grease. easy to clean
B000BZID8A|1|I bought this pump at the other sites. I can not narrow outer diameter, but fixed. Perhaps, I think to fit it to another part number. You can look at Amazon in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Genuine-Bosch-Fuel-Pump-0986580132/dp/B006HH7O5O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1T1R58AWAULUU&coliid=I3VZWG9P3QD59U
B001P3035I|5|If you have a heat intolerence issue I highly recommend this product. Perfect fot keeping you cool at the grandkids ballgames or whatever.
B002YKBAXK|1|Many people have already stated there's no seal between the cap and the bottle.  I'm confirming it, if you want to seal, you'll need to find either an O-ring or make a gasket.  As much as I like the large size of the bottle it is completely useless until the seal issue is fixed.
B004GCFAM6|5|fits great. easy to install.
B007WIDEJC|5|The red mirrors and other accents in the Nismo version were begging for a red dash mat, so I was very happy to find someone who offered it in red. The velour mat is also a little easier to get all the way forward when installing it than the lighter weight ones.
B000B8UPCY|5|Excellent product. I use this to lubricate seals, ... and use the green one to hold bearings, thrust washers, ... in place.
B000GTTD1C|5|I have several of these in my motorcycle trailer and love them. Easy to install, easy to remove and work great.
B0039OEOHE|3|Picture is not the same as the contents. Where is the valve cover gasket. Misleading!!!
B00KGIDA12|5|Worked perfectly
B000GKEY10|5|I saw that there is some question as to the longevity of these bulbs, sadly I can't comment as to that.  I purchased these for my motorcycle and it made a HUGE difference.  Much much brighter than anything I had tried before.
B006EGAIII|5|Nice set of ramps.  Replaced my old steel ramps now that I have an epoxy floor in my garage.  They did slide on the smooth floor, but a floor mat under each one solved the problem. They do work well with low clearance cars like my 350Z roadster.  Stacking is nice feature.  Would recommend for home use.
B005ZHFXKU|5|this does everything it says it will do cables are long but the one that goes to the starter solenoid was a bit way to short to get to it but mostly the product. not a very easy task for first time alarm installers but if you know your car well this is a 2 hour job depending on where all your wires are located. the shock sensor is amazing i have it set to the highest sensitivity since i live in the city and have had a car stolen already and my brother accidentally bumped my car with his door and immediately it went off. i also once place a set of jumper cables on the hood and had to rush back in because i set it off and the sensor is loosely placed in my glove box!! the two way pager is neat has a very good range in the city i can lock my car across a Walmart parking lot:) it also has a valet mode which only pages you if you are at a restaurant and don't want to hear your alarm go off but would like to know if something were to set if off this is perfect. overall viper is a 5 star product and i would recommend this to anyone that wants a car security system and doesn't mind spending 150 bucks on it, i know there are more cheaper security systems but this is a viper and i love that is gives you free stickers so people know whats in your car :)
B003ULHUPO|5|I've bought several of these, they work as new, and will fix multiple symptoms like poor transmission shifts, and hesitation. I operate a auto repair business and this is a common problem for cars nearing 100,000 miles.
B003RVX95W|5|Order came very quickly and it tookless than 5 min to activate remote I would recommend this to anyone who needs a replacement remote the instructions are very, very, very easy to follow Thank you S & I Remotes from a very satisfied customer
B0041DWY8I|1|The motor on this part is weak. Once installed, it barely had the power to get the window all the way up. I will be returning it.
B004I53JCE|5|Great fit durable nice looking
B00FJDL0J8|5|Great product, works exactly as advertised.
B001TZBB3K|5|This works awesome for me.  Never had a better way to clean glass without streaks.  It is very absorbent and does as advertised.
B00GI781AK|5|Instalation was easy and works just fine in my 2010 Honda Civic
B0019L65RG|4|I'm very happy with my new mud flaps they look great!  My only complaint was that I had to find installation instructions on the Internet.
B000NBWCFC|5|Good product.
B001FANQJG|1|As the other review said, the locks are difficult to line up. I just installed it today and one of the bolts broke. The key is difficult to insert. And the directions are hard to read.
B0070Y36N2|5|Great price and quality.
B006ZOIJ0S|5|These disconnects for my portable N scale train layout were very nice. They are quality pieces and work well. I would recommend this product.
B0006GF5SK|5|arrived on time, these are the easiest way to keep your rv holding tank fresh, no messy liquids to deal with just drop a tab in the pot and your done
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Easy to install, need needle nose pliers to act like a wedge to make a space from bumper to get washers and nuts on.  After that it's cake.  Easy to install wiring.  Strong and built well.  I'm happy.  Now shut up and tow something.
B00BKNNRZ6|5|Have used this brand for few years now ver reliable. Long lasting durability.
B0053H5W62|5|Great price, easy installation
B00VKI51TG|5|Solid product. I have tried everything to keep my butt from getting numb. This cushion has memory foam with two gel inserts which provide a comfortable ride. Used to get off the bike after about an hour of riding because my legs and butt hurt. This seat doesn't stop it but it allows me to shift my weight around the seat to get blood to the numbness. I can 100% stay on the bike longer. Clips are super easy to use on the foot pegs. It worked for me better than other options. I also use it for my 4wheeler which is cool. Great for trail riding in the mountains. I attached a picture of it on my atv. In the rain and sleet the pillow inside stayed dry! Very satisfied.
B000CN79IQ|5|I had the blue bushings from what I am assuming was a MOOG kit installed on my 98 eddie bauer explorer. I replaced the air ride system for normal shocks a few years ago, and the ride height in the front is lower and rear is higher than stock. This shredded the MOOG set, and I was getting really bad clunking and wheel movement when driving off road. Replaced the set, everything is great. I have this same setup on my mustang, which is lowered a little, and haven't had a problem in the 3 years I have owned it. Most of the other factory rubber has been replaced with Energy Suspension urethane, and aside from being a little noisy and being able to feel the road a little more, it performs much much better than stock.
B000RY4Y60|5|Big fan of these. Ordered two but wish I had somehow communicated that I would have preferred they were keyed alike so I didn't have to carry two keys.
B00RA1INQA|5|Excellent part at a Porsche price!
B000BRF6C4|1|the shipping was fast, as usual by Amazon.  The product is terrible, you can barely see the logo, its not a real Colts blue, more of a very dark navy almost purple color.  They will be going back.  I should have known the price was too good to be true for a product of any real value.
B006QMII1Y|5|This bumber scratch guard was 1/3 of the dealer price, was shipped really quickly and came with detailed- easy to follow directions.  It's already come in handy and avoided a nasty gouge when a friend put his bike in the car!
B003DPRTWG|5|I have a 2013 king quad 750 and honestly I hardly write reviews but this was well worth it. If you want something heavy duty when your cruising through the woods and your smacking into large brush or small trees trust me you want the bison front bumper. If you have a king quad and you actually put it to the test like I do you will soon come to realize that front plastic garbage will fall apart in a day and you'll have to zip tie it down. I put this bad boy on, perfect fit and it doesn't get better than this thing. First thing I did was go out and plow into a tree to test it out and it does not phase this bumper. Great quality and great service.
B0026Y81UE|4|Have had 2 of these on my last 2 tundras. Work great. Easy off and on. Hold tight at freeway speeds into heavy head winds. Minor water leakage at the front corners. Would buy a third one if I get another truck
B002SER6YO|5|THE MAS7 MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR CLEANER CAME ON TIME AS PROMISE. I BOUGHT GUNK MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR BECAUSE MY SENSOR WOULD NEEDED CLEANER WHEN THE WEATHER WAS A LITTLE WARMER.
B004Q3MDIY|5|I have been looking for this steering wheel cover ever since the store where I used to buy them went out of business.  I was very happy to find them on Amazon.  The product looks, fits, and feels exactly as I remember from the one the store used to carry.  I also appreciate being able to find them at a reasonable price as I found similar products elsewhere online but at a considerably higher price.  I bought two.
B000WJA5ZY|3|If you are having difficulty with a shorter arm due to the angle you can get, then maybe this isn't for you. The maximum ball coverage that RAM Mount touts which created by the clamps at each end is great for strength in terms of holding a set position. However it can be very restrictive in terms of positioning, especially if you are more concerned about what is behind your device instead of it's face. The example I have for that is that I am using the standard camera on a phone to record video out the front of the vehicle as I drive around a track. The inflexible positioning capabilities of this and the shorter arms, makes getting the mount point (suction cup) out of the frame, pointing the camera in the right direction, and in a position which does not obstruct the driver's view impossible. As it turns out, it doesn't matter whether you are using the short 2&#34;, medium 3&#34;, or this large 6&#34; arm, the same problem persists. And the longer arm makes it harder to get the whole thing in a non-obstructive position, and still doesn't help with the over all angle.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love this mounting system is awesome. It is the strongest thing out there, and you basically can't yank it out of window if it is secured properly. The flexibility of positioning however is the sacrifice for this strength.<br /><br />I don't just come bearing a problem however... I have a solution. Please paste this part number into the search of Amazon, if you want a more flexible solution for a RAM Mount set up. RAP-B-200-2. RAM has this on their website, but if you do not know the part number, it is almost impossible to find.
B002NAS052|5|They are great glad I bought them
B009T8MA3Y|5|perfect fit.
B008SEBQ2G|4|Works great, love the way it looks
B00OCEFQGS|5|Great product!
B00065L2D8|5|This product is worth the price.  Clamps are better quality than they show. Wires are not long but sufficient for emergency or short term use. Anything beyond that probalbly should be hard wired anyway.
B0002M9QJM|5|Great improvement over a sealed beam,I changed to a 100w high beam to start with as I'm in geezer age bracket and black cows (or deer)standing or laying in the road are harder to see,great help. The high is fairly thin but goes a long way out.I have contemplated setting it up so both elements are lit on high but don't know if the alternator can come up with the juice or if the heat would toast the elements.
B001U8QS9I|4|These seatcovers look very nice! I havent had a chance to put them in my Pontiac G6 but from what I can see they seem like they will look great in my car! The shipping was quick. It was an all around great Buy!!!
B00CMG00HS|5|I don't know why Ford doesn't use seat levers of this quality to start with. They are a high quality replacement.
B000H8XO3A|4|Easy to install, bright lights once again. Only negative is that the beam throws a slightly irregular pattern, but it does not seem to reduce its effectiveness.
B000S2SKIY|5|Snapped into place within 3 min., unhooked neg.lead on my battery for 3 min. which reset my check engine light. works perfectly!!!
B001AWLEL6|3|Height nuts need more 10-15 mm, uncomfortable twist, jumps off key. Do not even dream quickly change the wheel.Disappointed.It is unacceptable for ITP.
B005H12QXG|5|Great fit, no vibration, easy install, and super fast shipping
B000I14RY6|4|The tool is nice, but there are different elements than pictured. The big thumb knob is plastic, not steel or aluminum as pictured in the listing. I purchased this to remove a rear wiper arm, this was nowhere near big enough to even come halfway down the shaft of the arm. Not a fault of the tool though, it's obviously made for the smaller front wiper arms. I decided to keep the tool anyway. Ended up having to go to Harbor Freight to purchase a set of &#34;pullers&#34;. They worked perfectly!
B000JFNAK8|5|Tool works great and shipped promptly.
B00ARJO12M|5|Works and fits great to care of problem
B00065ZIJ2|5|great good to protect car from  theft
B004GCSE9M|5|Great part!
B004R2Y64S|5|work very well, installed easily
B005HAYDR4|5|So I read all the reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase these cause the price was cheap and sure did make the right decision. They got here in a timely manner and they are good quality grab handles for my wrangler . Easy and quick to install , def recommend for purchasing.
B00P05CJ54|4|Very good quality harness with easy to follow directions/diagram. My switch arrived wired backwards, so this complicated installation a bit, but once I figured out what the problem was, it went very smoothly. I plan on ordering more of these for other light bars on different vehicles.
B00BSGGGZ8|5|Excellent
B00EDFM5QU|5|Definitely has made a difference in the trailer
B00L841M36|5|Works great easy fit no issues
B00B2HP1A4|5|exactly as described. look nicer than most kits. installs without drilling into the rack which would compromise the structural integrity.
B000SEADT6|2|This cover does a great job of keeping the car cool but I cannot recommend it die to its construction.<br /><br />The throwing weights are very heavy and I think they risk denting the car if they bang the other side when thrown,  With the weights removed, it's impossible to handle the cover in even the lightest wind.<br /><br />Also, the front and back are provided with suction cups, but they are attached with metal grommets and a metal ring.  I think these risk scratching the paint, either during installation/removal or if they start flopping in the wind<br /><br />Too bad, the idea is good but I cannot recommend it.
B00BVL7M26|5|Bought these for my husband he has tried them on all sizes of wire and he loves them says they work great.
B00JFQ19OG|4|Very small and has no way to secure it. But does the job.
B001KS0M5E|5|Perfect fit.
B008G2236S|5|shipped quickly great fit
B00NJRYPSE|5|Fits perfectly over the factory holes if you have the RS package spoiler.  Note that it uses 4 of the 6 factory holes so you should cover up the other two with something to prevent water leaking in (I will be using some black silicon).  Can't be beat at this price.
B003IS3HV0|1|Bought this to revive a pair of quite expensive Finn Comfort shoes. I wish I hadn't. All the product did was darken the leather (a lot) and make it slightly sticky and dull. The leather absorbed all the goop right away - now it's been more than 12 hours and the leather is lifeless, no better than before, just a lot darker.<br /><br />Waste of time and money.
B000LG0B3Y|5|Great fit. AWESOME sound. My second Gibson system. The first was same system but aluminized and the muffler rusted through AFTER 15 YEARS! The truck has 175,000+ miles on it now. I get stopped all the time and told the truck sounds so good. It's the Gibson! Go for the best and get the stainless!
B003MB4NUC|5|Great price and has good quality build probably should have bought all four at the same time but I was glad to find out I can buy one at a time.
B009JZV9UW|3|disappointed... helmet looked great until i noticed right away one if the vent covers on front was snapped off.. found in the helmet bag. setup for a return and replacement, but... can only get refund for some reason??  i guess will get refund and shop again. hard to give good review when never got to even try it out on the road...
B004ALKKO6|4|complete set fit good.
B00AXOXM26|5|After double and then triple checking that I was ordering the right ones for my truck, I was happy to find that these covers were easy to install and fit perfectly. I've had them for several months now and they seem to be durable though not particularly stain resistant.
B005JVNQSS|5|So far, so go. Rust has not returned to the tools I used them on. Only time will tell how well it will work.
B000GV73TY|5|Perfect fit, super easy installation and the performance is better than the stock pipe.
B00042KJQ4|4|Not much to say other than it does what it is supposed to do. I have used it a couple of times when I was stuck in the sand and it worked.
B00CF5Q0OI|4|We bought this for a parent with dementia and who occasionally loses the remote control to the TV. After connecting it, the caregiver was able to find the remote. Unfortunately, the fobs are a bit bulky for attachment to a remote control with the small piece of double-sided tape that was enclosed in the packet. A more robust Velcro connection was needed.
B00CMX20H4|3|It works , expected to be louder . It is louder than OEM horn but not that much
B007Z1TZQM|5|great deal
B006WHEBGE|1|Only worked for a couple of months, then I had to replace it again.
B0082ACB8E|2|This is a discount cover at a discount price. Spend a few more bucks and get something better quality. If you really need to read why... keep reading.<br />I figured I'd save a few bucks and go with this one because the price seemed great and the reviews weren't bad.<br />While it's true, the cover comes pre-assembled and installs very easily, the fit on my 2015 Ram Sport (5'7&#34; Non-Rambox Bed) was less than acceptable.<br />1. The cover clamps aren't deep enough to reach past the plastic Ram Sport top caps to clamp onto the actual metal underside of the bed. This means that the clamps try to push the plastic caps up and away from the bed and never really get tight to the actual bed. I circumvented the issue by putting some small wood spacers inside the bed lip to allow the clamps to tightly clamp onto the bed. (You could also cut notches into the bed caps with a hacksaw... but really?)  The wood seemed to help a little until I found issue #2...<br />2. The aluminum crossbars connecting the driver and passenger side end about 10&#34; from the rail side, and turn into plastic. This becomes a problem especially at the front of the bed near the cab. The covers frame never clamps down tight to the front corners. Sure you can put a wood spacer under the bed rail so the clamp doesn't bottom out (The threads aren't really long enough to get all the way down) but this results in the plastic portion of the cross rails flexing down to form a &#34;U&#34; shape where the clamp is anchored to the cover. That means that at highway speeds the front corners of the cover have &#34;flex&#34; and waive at you in your side view mirrors revealing up to a 1/2&#34; gap. Kinda scary when you are passing someone on the highway wondering if the cover is going to &#34;Un-install&#34; itself onto their windshield.<br />3. The clamps themselves want to murder the cover when folding it up. The plastic clamps are mounted onto metal threaded rod that if not properly folded (and watched with anuntrusting eye) try to impale the cover as the final fold toward the cab is accomplished. I can only imagine trying to load something in the back of the truck in a hurry (say in the winter, or a rainstorm) and realizing that I have some cool new piercings punched through the vinyl when I fold the cover back out.<br /><br />This was not my first tonno cover, and the last one I had lasted 140,000 miles through 8 New England winters. It was a pain in the winter but at least the design of the frame and clamps made sense.
B008IK7TSA|5|it works great.
B00F06FYKU|5|Product worked great!
B00068OKZ2|5|If you need to replace your ignition coil why not upgrade to the high output of an MSD ignition coil. Ir bolts in the same place as the OEM and has been performing flawless for over 12 months now.
B001GH1PB4|5|For your older 4runner rear end.<br /><br />Painful to install for me but thats no reflection on the product. They seem to be sturdy and work for mostly correcting 4runner sag. I would have liked a little higher lift, but for the price and fit they work very well.
B000NPGG0U|5|I purchased this set for my new car and I have to say it looks amazing! It was packaged nicely and it came just as expected. It wasn't damaged at all and the colors look exactly like the picture. The only thing I'm worried about is hello kitty's face getting dirty but that's nothing some elbow grease and some Clorox can't fix! Loving this product and will be purchasing again from seller! A+++++
B000IBGGT0|5|This is perfect for keeping your sunglasses, your phone or any other small items you need easy access to.  Keeps it all dry too.  Road tested on rain drenched 10 day ride.
B0031XMM9A|5|Just as described, fit perfectly
B000E9C21M|5|If you have a personalized license plate get a protector for it! And if your car is already tinted front to back why not throw in some tinted protection! Otherwise the clear is a most likely a better choice for you.
B000CITK8S|5|Does exactly what I want, keeps my tractor battery charged for the winter. I also use one for my car battery when I storing it.
B00AZQY7Z8|5|Awesome Cool goes, and came really quickly! Looked awesome!
B00062YVPW|4|After owning digital and other mechanical styles, this is by far the best one I've had. It is sturdy, seems to be accurate. I'm sure it will last a long time because of it's simple, well-built design.
B00355MTEW|5|I bought these as a gift for my daughter. They were everything they said they would be. Install was easy. I love the longer pads, they covered the whole seat. She loves them. Thank you.
B000GKD722|5|Works as promised great product.
B00ID9RF8U|5|This is a great item but had to return it because it was to small. awesome return, no charges not even shipping and UPS picked it up.
B001MOSCKI|5|This product works in my oldsmobile cutlass 1998. Every button worked fine, all details clear. I would recommend this if you need a replacement
B007ICCI6M|5|These high performance stainless  steel exhaust pipes are well made and fit My 1966 El Camino. They rubbed the powerglide transmission shift linkage but after installing a 4L60 trans with cable linkage it was good.
B00HNNQF0Q|3|This which is what I wanted.  The only complaint is that a few of the squares bind up a bit leaving a lump.
B004QSDDVU|1|Did not fit even though it was supposed to be the &#34;Exact&#34; match - filter is too long and won't fit in the housing.
B003TKDOGA|5|Good product
B00NBE0SE0|5|Really hard to push torsion bars out
B004I0FBNO|4|…it appears to be a suitable replacement for the front left side marker.  It shipped quickly and arrived adequately packaged, nothing broken or damaged.
B002VVIQLQ|1|Original Motorcraft lasted 145k.  Of course 3 of 8 plugs broke removing the originals but after reading reviews I knew to get the extraction tool in advance so removal of the lower half of broken plugs wasn't that bad. Take your time and ease out the shaft.<br /><br />Replaced coils with Accel and they are great!!<br /><br />I bought into the Champion 'double platinum' yada yada in May of this year and they are only good as sinkers for my fishing line.  As with many others, my dad always said to never put a Champion plug in anything bigger than a lawnmower; sorry I didn't listen pops.  This second Champion plug I removed had a zero gap?? After further inspection the center electrode metal piece is broken/missing a piece.  I can tap the side electrode and it appears; tap the terminal and it disappears...magic?? No- ITS JUNK.  The first replacement Champion that failed was similar.<br /><br />I'm going back with Motorcraft.  Motorcraft has a new design with their plugs; yes, still two piece but instead of being crimped the two pieces are welded.  So I would much rather take the chance of a plug removal after another 100k + knowing I have an extractor tool then take the chance of another Champion plug failing every 10k or less.  This last one, we were 6 hours away from home during Thanksgiving.  No thanks Champion; I'd like to give your plugs back!<br /><br />UPDATE 12-19-14: I replaced the plugs with Motorcraft SP-515 Spark Plugs and WOW; a huge difference.  After I replaced them, my son's jumped in with me and when we hit the highway I actually peeled out inadvertently because I wasn't used to having power again :) Took another 12 hour round trip this week and received 1.5 to 2 mph better on fuel; AND CONSIDERABLY MORE POWER.  I also want to mention that two other Champion plugs I removed were worn out beyond gapping.<br /><br />GET THE EXTRACTOR TOOL, THE SPARK PLUG SOCKET SET AND MOTORCRAFT SP-515 PLUGS AND BE DONE!!!
B000C55NIM|5|Quality brand name parts. Exact fit. Great Price.  Really great ride now, replaced all 4 struts and mounting plates.  Challenging project for the average home mechanic.
B0032YXA7Q|2|I have purchased many kensun lo xenon/ hi halogen bulbs in different temperatures and bulb connections over the course of 3 years for different vehicles and thought I should finally write a review. The xenon bulb on these lamps are great and function perfectly, with color temperature being accurate. On the other hand, if you purchase these bulbs expecting the halogens to work, you will be very disappointed. On every pair of bulbs I have purchased that have lo xenon/ hi halogen, when you switch to HI about the 4th or 5th time, without fail, WITHOUT FAIL, one of the halogen bulbs will burn out. I thought these bulbs were going to be better, but same result as always. Please take this information into consideration when purchasing these bulbs.
B00ANZHG4U|5|Over the past two months, we have nearly completely replaced paper towels in our home with Zwipes. As cleaning cloths, napkins, and \\"swifter\\" sheets, these microfiber clothes consistently outperform their disposable predecessors. They're perfect in the kitchen for cleaning counters, glass front stoves, refrigerators, kitchen appliances, and cabinet doors. They're soft enough and handsome enough to use as dinner napkins (in our blue kitchen) but can also handle the tray and fingers of an 11 mth old. As dust clothes (or in the swifter), they easily eliminate the dust, hair, and dander that collects on shelves, tables, vents, fans... every nook and cranny! In our constant battle against the shedding habits of the German Shephard (and various other shedding mammals), Zwipes have tipped the balance in our favor!! In the bathroom, the Zwipes just as easily clean the tiled walls as they do the dried toothpaste drippings of small children. One case has been enough for our home, as I shake out and wash once a week with perfume free detergent and no fabric softener (do take note of the washing instructions and no static cleaning cloths on computers or TV screens!). Great purchase!
B000KOTXSQ|4|Had to replace my old jack which was a Fulton. I noticed they added a grease zerk by the crank. A good idea because that is where the old one failed. Appears to be well built and should last longer than the old one.I would recommend this for larger, heaver trailers with more tongue weight.
B001LHVOVK|4|it could be a little faster, but otherwise it does what it needs to do.  quick money saver, cleared my check engine light.  it would be nicer with more buttons, however 2 does get the job done
B00CJ69F2W|5|Used this at my old job and it worked great! It worked well on black cars!  I would recommend this if you want to restore your black paint.
B000NLYJ26|1|When I purchased these for my '07 silverado new body style they said it would fit my truck. But the hardware is all wrong! All the hardware it came with is to small, so I'm assuming it must be for the '07 old body style. The support bracket doesn't fit either! When I sent DeeZee an email explaining the problem and asking if they had hardware to fit my truck they never responded!
B000CN5QG8|5|Great deal around tailgate, have used on previous trucks as well, keeps most of the wet out.
B000I1KJT8|2|I purchased these to replace a set purchased from harbor freight.  The build quality is great, but the ends on them just don't hold hose clamps securely.  I ended up buying a set of bluepoint pliers from the snap-on guy and they blow these things away.  Perhaps they hold some hose clamps well but not the ones I work with...
B000CCIFQM|5|great heavyduty racing oil that stand up to high temps in classic hi performance cars,i use valvoline when ever i can.
B00I9B0AJS|5|worked great
B0040CYZJG|5|works well
B002IC43ZG|1|Ordered fronts and received back. It would have been nice to know prior to beating the old rotors off with a hammer.
B005KVLX50|5|haul my 14ft mad river canoe like no problem in my 6ft 4 inch box 12 ram. make sure you invest in some tie down straps when hauling and also put tennis balls over the support bars, they may damage canoe or kayak if not covered
B002LRQRMU|1|Hi i bought a mirror for my chevy s10 and it didnt fit it which it said it would fit my car but it didnt it is still stored in the box.
B000COCWIC|4|Does the job fine.  The only downside is that it's a bit hard to get out once it's been installed.  There isn't a good &#34;lip&#34; to grab onto to pry it out of the hole.  But it was bought to cover a lighter hole that had no cover at all, and which isn't expected to be USED much at all, so it should do what we need it to do.
B001K8YR0A|5|I received the sensor and was able to install it within a few minutes. I did not have to rewire anything and the cable was long enough that there were no issues. About an hour after replacing the sensor my &#34;Check engine&#34; light turned off on it's own, saving me not only on the cost of the sensor, but also time going to the dealership o have the light reset.
B001GMX8V4|4|I don't have any complaints about this product.  For me, the wires were long enough and I was able to fit everything in like I needed it.
B0080KN7RU|5|Great looking decal, made of high quality material the will stand up in all kinds of conditions. Inside or outside. Nice, really nice!
B005992QKO|5|Have seen mention of the longer pins ,but they are needed with newer receiver hitches that are both 2\\" + 2 1/2\\".Glad I had them when towing with a new Ford Super Duty.
B00CF280LM|5|I like the lights, the 55w kit heats up to fully bright quickly.  I had a similar set from a different seller that looked identical to this one in the 6k color.  The performance of the lights was the same, but I'm not a huge fan of that color for driving.  I know the 6k color is the most popular, but I'm not sure why?  I've now had 4300, 5000, and 6000 and none look like the OEM high end factory HID's on high end cars.  Why can't any of these aftermarket kits duplicate that color?<br /><br />Anyway, great, bright lights that are great for driving.
B000CLBKEW|5|Made the car not smell like farts for a while.
B000CB6CFY|5|Very high quality filter, very similar in design and function the porsche-emblem part at much lower cost.<br /><br />Note these have a foam pre-filter and for some applications there may be some upside re airflow in using a K&N style high flow filter. But for those of us who just want our OEM cars to keep working happily, this is a super choice.
B00496RE82|5|I purchased this to cycle fuel through my marine fuel tank, had some junk in my fuel and this made cleaning a breeze.  Ran it for an hour through a marine water seperator and cleaned my fuel the easy way.
B0040I6E9O|5|This product works great in my 2003 Durango. Although it doesn't come with directions it is quite simple and easy enough to figure out with a little intuition. You simply choose what size wiring you want to use (I used the thick green), whether or not you should use the &#34;gold&#34; plated tips (I did not), then simply push the finished ends into the plug. It looks like they wouldn't fit through the seal but the holes stretch. The tips click into place. Then just cut the wires to the correct size for your vehicle to avoid excess wires laying all over the place and splice them. Do them one at a time to make sure your connecting the right numbers together or label them before you disconnect the old resistor. Unscrew and replace old resistor. Plug in new plug. Done.<br /><br />My blower feels like its running stronger with the thicker wires installed (used to have thin purple wires all shoved up all over the place I don't know why. Must have been the previous owner. Was a mess) and all the levels of power now work as well. Problem solved.
B0018EO2VK|5|The shields work and look great.
B00FY81BUQ|4|Works like they should. Switch is a worth a nickel, but sold for 1000 times the price.
B003UM9GDM|3|Jack works fine, and all parts came shipped ok.  Only complaint is its not low enough to get under my bike.  I have a nightster which is low, but I have to drive onto a 4x6 to clear the lift.  But it does get the job done.
B004QF1JGE|4|I chopped wood for 4 1/2 hours and hauled it all the way to my house in a home made wheelbarrow with no problems! Hard knuckles are great for small animal defense also! Would recommend to anyone outdoorsy with a slight chance of small pest animals attacking.
B008CSF5P2|5|They're exactly what I was looking for!
B001EP28XW|4|Got this because the stock tow hitch cover for my Tacoma got stolen which didn't bother me much.  But I don't like leaving the hitch open and exposed.  This cover is solid metal and black so it matches perfectly.
B000BLMJN4|5|It is just a light bulb ... nothing to get too excited about.  The price was excellent and the speed with which I received my bulb, top notch!
B00GUCMEGK|1|To much noise, even for the track.<br /><br />It give the bike power, but the exhaust is anoying to loud, must use earplugs with the helmet on.<br /><br />I install and uninstall the very same day and install again my fmf core 4 with arrestor.
B00QDCIJGG|2|Very dissapointed. I wouldn't  recomend this plate to anyone. Simply cheap and not unique at all. Cheap material...it looks like a bad color photocopy!
B00265M8LQ|4|Worked pretty good when I used them.  I did have one of the reverse drill bits break during use, but it was the small one.
B005JKF9RK|3|Very stout well built step. However, too bulky and I had to modify every single step to fit around my spring hangers. Plus the steps were way deeper than my Reading utility box. One step I had to completely disassemble, cut, redesign and put back together. Turned into a huge project, but they are on there and now that they are I like them.
B000E7YYDS|1|No good -- it leaks and does not have good settings for watering plants.
B008QBTLDW|1|I really tried to make this work but it comes unclipped after each use and then flings off the seat belt.
B002M1BRYI|5|These worked on my 92 F350 7.3 idi. There was enough hose for me to work with but that is because I did not try to change the line on the way back side of the engine.
B00CA350BE|2|I got the bypass  in like three days it was very easy to install
B005RR5D12|5|Easy install and clean look, it really adds some style to the interior. It also has a nice look to it, and adds personality to the car. My 8 is that much cooler now.
B00GUF74HQ|5|This really works. Should be standard equip on all new trucks.
B004KEIU1S|3|I always have a supply of these sealing valve caps on hand to replace those that seem to walk at various times e.g. when tire maintenance services are performed.
B0007LVJ2A|1|The cylinder fell out of the locking mechanism on the first day of use, probably the second time I unlocked it. I requested a refund/return from the company and it says I will receive and I don't have to return the item. I appreciate that, but would not buy this item again, and therefor I would not recommend it to others.
B008T4YOY2|4|I like the helmet. It is cheaper than the other helmets that I was looking at. It does fog up if it's completely close but I usually have it open a little bit. the vents help keep it cool for your head.
B003FVFV46|5|I'm happy that i chose to order this, it got here fast plus it looked and fit amazing. just what i needed.
B00916MMJG|5|We really like the scooter mount. We needed to get a different ramp for it because we have it on an RV (way too high for the ramp), but it works really great on the back of an SUV. Easy to put together.
B004AGTQZK|5|I'm very pleased with the coffee mugs I ordered. They came quickly, packaged in such a way to protect them. I had been looking for this style mug for some time and was pleased to find them. Thank you!
B005NLCGF8|5|Some parts chains will read your codes for free, this can do the same without you having to drive to one, saves time in that regard.  Other places charge a fee, saves money in those instances.  I use this OBD adapter in conjunction with TORQ on my phone to save tons on gas, we found the ideal speed for every car we drive on the highway and always set the cruise control there.  Rated it 5 stars because I don't see how it could get any better, but I will come back and change my rating if I ever have a problem with it.  It does seem to stay on when the car is off, be sure to unplug if your battery can't handle a little overnight drain.
B00DBEPC2S|1|Donot buy
B004X2BMKI|4|We love Jack and this set fit nicely in 08 VW Rabbit, seat covers don't shift getting in/out like others do. Steering wheel cover fit good too.  Good quality for the price, btw we love jack :o)
B003M2IGU4|5|20.00 per tip is about 1/3 to 1/2 off the cost of these at most muffler shops.  Got them on the truck today along with a Flowmaster Super 44, they sound great.  I had them put onto a 2002 Dodge ram.  The Flowmaster was a Super 44 2.5 inlet with dual 2.5 outlet, they fit great!<br /><br />Sorry for the lack of review, but these are a great price for what they are.
B0016KBQ0G|5|Bright. Very Bright. Made the interior compartment of my 21 year old van glow like the heart of a thermonuclear detonation. Plasma coiled around my heart.
B003123EFC|5|TM Designworks make high quality products for your off road vehicles. What comes on your dirt bike may be fine for a short while, but this after-market product is an essential to prevent expensive repairs.
B0010E4FTW|5|I was getting no where on 2 bolts holding my brake pad mounts on the wheel, tried 2 other products to no avial.  Read a couple of reviews of PB Blaster and was intrigued by someone who said it doesn't drip.  Read about the stuff and that the liquids is magnetized so it clings to the bolts (if steel).  Tried it and it does!  Clings like a babies... nevermind.  Anyway, waited a few minutes and tried again, and heard that wonderful grunt sound that a bolt makes when it is loosing it's grip!  Awesome!  Highly recommend.  PS, you can find it in just about any auto parts store for around $5 and if you drive yourself, free shipping!
B002IKWGV6|5|Awesome product, is a comfortable gloves that fits well.
B000EZYASY|5|Great, quality starter at an incredible price! Starts up the first try and works like a charm every time! GREAT VALUE!
B00COYNWP0|2|Great looking seat cover at first and it protects my seat. Downside is that it was really hard to put on my seat and within days the fabric was ripped and pulling at the seams. I still use it but it looks a little ghetto.
B009XA1JNA|1|Bad quality and worst customer support
B001AXZ33A|5|Good
B000FULUYU|5|Item arrived early, was expecting the item to be cheaply made from china... but to my surprise was almost as thick as a regular license plate.
B00TUNSV2W|5|I am a true follower of the 303 product line. This particular cleaner/degreaser is no different and stands ip tot the 303 product name. A very powerful cleaner with a clean scent. Removed road tar, bugs and other marking from my bumper and pain surfaces. Heavier soiled areas may need a second application; however, the cleaner performed well in comparison to other similar products on the market. Also found it useful for removing marks on my house siding as well as clean up of patio furniture. It was also able to remove heavy scum from the bathtub  and grime from chrome areas as well. Definitely worth purchasing as well as the other 303 products.
B000AMBO9O|1|didnt work had replace catalytic  after use , it clogged it made it worse . no i wouldnt recommend it
B000C53ZUU|4|The only downside was that one of the springs was slightly misshapen  on the very bottom end, not enough to render it un-useable but it didn't  fit the plastic insulator as well as the other spring. On my 1990 Bronco 2, they raised the front end by 3/4&#34; - 7/8&#34; and in the short period since installing the springs, the ride quality seems unchanged.
B003Z9UUUS|5|Great addition to the 'rig', strongly recommend this to any one looking for a bed cover, light weight, tight fit and dry inside.
B00DZUDQPS|5|works great; came in the stated amount of time; friendly sales people. One thing to know for sure is the lug nut spacing and the thread pitch. Amazon was off on the what fits which vehicle. I ordered the wrong part but Amazon and Titan Wheel Accessories were quick to rectify the problem. I'm very happy with what I got and the service received
B004J6H2X4|5|Break pads are silent and came with all the parts. There was a little more rounding in the squealer clips than I wanted so reused the old ones. These look to be great pads. I coupled them with a new set of rotors and they break beautifully from all speeds.
B00EK5D5O4|5|It's been very alsome
B000IZ0THQ|5|Was hard to get the OEM O2 sensor off.. found it easiest to lay under my H3 wheel well and grab that sucker and just pull on the wrench!!! My O2 sensor tool cracked so i had to improvise... But this went in no problem, my vehicle runs like a champ... was nothing wrong before i'm just coming up on 100,000 miles and was swapping parts out!
B000E16IPQ|5|I keep these bungees in my truck at all times so I'm prepared to strap anything down at any time. they work extremely well and haven't been stretched out from moderate use
B005KI78LG|4|Took a little bit to get but besides that all good no scratches packaged good
B004LYR4FK|5|I bought a dozen of these to light a long walk way outside. This is the 3rd year they have been in use and only one has failed. These lights get beat up in snow, Ice, rain, sun and heat. They do the job I need
B00ATXEPQI|3|I have not really used yet.
B00KWLM3OS|1|thing was broken when i got it i had it as a spare and never got to use it due to a hole in the corner
B0031BL3CE|5|It's awsome, the ease of instalation and the sound are amazing, BUY IT!! you won't be sorry. I love it
B00CJXNEUO|2|Just some stickers off a roll. Not very well made, and the graphics are kinnda blurry. Not very pleased. avoid
B004081BV0|2|This produc did not have the hardware needed to install.  Very disappointing!,,,,,<br /><br />I had to try and find the hardware that should gave been included
B00G4L23PY|5|Nice and bright but don't last as long as stock HD bulbs.
B0068OZ25K|5|Worked exactly as advertised and set-up was a breeze.  Appears to be a refurbished oem unit.  Very happy with outcome!
B00KWDQY7I|5|Good for my es350 2007
B000PL2B3I|1|Multiple Random Misfires - threw repeated codes. Cleared codes 3 times. 2002 Oldsmobile Aurora 3.5 Northstar V-6. I had to replace these right away, replaced with AC Delco 41-950 Platinum plugs are the car runs wonderful. No other changes were made to the motor, just a plug change. Stay away from these!
B007K23SEQ|4|The appearance was very good and quality was fair.<br /><br />They are a little wobbly once mounted.. they move easily when you push on either side of the lense.  The OEM headlights were more resistant to movement upon pressure.
B000H6P55W|4|Why would you ever buy a hard top roof rack? We used this cargo bag and it was great. We put all of our sleeping bags and bulky items into it and it worked great. The best part? It is super easy to store when you are done. About the size of a large duffel. The straps are easy to use and it is waterproof.
B00HPTLHQK|5|This part arrived exactly as advertised!  Fast shipping too!
B001CX12TW|5|nice tool set for out on the open road. fits nicely in the harley tool box i bought. would leave home with out it.
B004XACFK6|5|Nice product
B001DRLPJ4|5|Filter was sent in proper packaging and sent in a timely manner. Fairly simple to install and works like a charm. I've used this filter in the past and have always been happy with its performance.  Much better than paper filters IMO.
B000C7YKIY|5|No need to adjust, cut, or file anything down to get this to fit properly. This is one aftermarket part that fits like an OEM part.<br />Both connectors fit well, and wire lengths are a good fit.<br />Definitely recommend this to other Toyota Pickup guys!
B000EVYH72|5|Great basic timing gun for most jobs. Highly recommended!
B00JLJI648|5|Works perfect, thank you.
B004I12438|5|came to see this one so i can order the other side now and noticed i can put a review for the one i ordered 9 months ago, well it turned out perfect. no problems. no scratches and it fits and works perfect. no complaints. now going to order the other side. thank you and again it works perfect.
B005XARUCI|5|Fast shipping and way bigger then I was planning on. I love it and it goes great for a couple that share a car. Love it easy to use great! Thanks
B001KQW5L0|3|I ordered this as an OEM type replacement for my 2004 Mustang Cobra.  It has the stock clutch to 40,000 miles and then it was slipping a bit.<br /><br />The pedal effort on this is great, but I am getting a smell, that familiar burning clutch smell.  I do have more torque than stock (473 ft/lbs to the ground), but didn't have problems with the OEM clutch.  This one seems a bit weaker.
B00FDGVMVW|1|Terrible reception, but I normally listen to CD's to whatever. I got the few stations I like when I am in the mood for a talk-radio-show in the mornings ...<br /><br />One month later and I hit a pine tree limb weighted with snow in a driveway - lost the antenna! Not a terrible loss at all, but the way the double ended threading works I now have half of it stuck into my antenna receiver! I'll have to remove my hood, take the receiver out, and then replace it or try to remove the stub that is left in the threads.<br /><br />If you hate your antenna just snap it off and buy a CD player with a connection for your mp3 player. This antenna is awful and has set me back a lot of time/money!!
B009PPL604|5|Great product and a great alternative to professional fuel system cleaning!<br /><br />This was my second use of this product, the first time I used it in my 90,000 mile Volvo , and more recently in my 299,000 mile Honda insight. On the Volvo it was more of a general maintenance item, although it did help smooth out the Volvo's idle some. I noticed the most improvements in my Honda Insight. After 299k and regular maintenance, it had developed a rough idle, made rougher with the AC on. After completing this fuel system cleaning , per the instructions, the idle is 100% better and idles like a new car (or as close to new as a 299k car can be).<br /><br />Although the instructions may not mention it, I recommend running your car until it is completely warmed up before starting the fuel system intake cleaning. Just be sure to install the tube with the engine cold, before you warm it up; this will make for less burned hands. I also like using a lint free cloth when cleaning the throttle body to help break loose any major buildup.
B005O01RF8|5|Great product!  Great service!
B000E8T80Q|5|I got these filters for my 2001 Accord and I couldn't be more satisfied. These were at one moment pretty expensive on Amazon but the price has went back down now. These filters compared to OEM Honda filters are almost about 1 1/2 bigger than the OEM ones. I looked up the displacement and these filters filter out a lot more than any other filter for the price. The next best thing might be a K&N oil filter or a Mobil 1 oil filter. For $5 each, this is definitely a steal and I would stock up on these.
B0010E00T6|4|Seem to work well, can't tell if the air is a fresher smell but seem to work well simple to install.
B000WER72I|5|Perfect fit.
B000C7TZT8|3|The tank is fine.  However, it needs additional paint to really be corrosion resistant.  I used POR-15 rust preventative paint on the full exterior of the tank.  It is also a very tight fit, which required me to do a little grinding to fit fore-aft (length).  All other dimensions work fine: grommet holes, width, tubes.  A decent tank.  If you want a true OEM quality replacement you need a klokkerholm, which VanCafe might be able to get you.  Or you can order it overseas from Custom & Commercial, but the shipping is expensive.
B000FQ7F1Q|5|This fits my 1978 CJ7 with a stock radiator. My old hoses were hosed... This new hose was cheap and with amazon prime came extremely quickly!
B0063L50E6|4|Great craftsmanship, my only complaint is that one of the rivots fell off on the strap. Nothing a nut and bolt can't fix.
B004VR0DF0|5|Great product but had to send back...the 80 inch ones do not fit a ram crew cab, so I sent them back and got the 87 inch ones, which fit perfectly.
B002P8LWDO|4|very satisfied, easy to install.
B000C9FOZA|5|5 STARS!
B00KL3ALGO|5|I got these to use in my back seat when I have my niece. She's already been less whiny about the sun in her face so I think they're working perfectly. The set is easy to use and work well to shade the back seat. They're a rather simple product so I'm not sure what more I can say other than I love them.
B004I0K0CQ|5|Not available at my local Toyota Dealer and not wanting to drive to the wrecking yard - this worked perfectly and reasonably priced.
B002R0ATAW|5|It was a perfect fit. Very pleased.
B004OKCP6E|5|I am so in love with these rugs they are perfect the price was immaculate they are worth every penny and more
B00KVPNVJ6|5|LOVED IT WHILE I  USED IT BUT IT IS IN STORAGE FOR NOW. VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO THE WORLD
B0095ZKA06|4|Works  very well. Make sure the sensor is seated all the way down to avoid leaks. The bullet terminal ends are very cheap but east to replace. Very accurate reading.
B00BI9DRHK|5|Wife loves them
B0015S96IS|1|i liked it and it looks awsome but it didnt fit my bmw 330ci,u better wrote in the description what cars fits with it.
B002ZYQJD6|5|My old compressor was so loud it was almost embarassing. It finally quit working. After reading good reviews, I ordered this part and it was delivered in just a couple days. The part is very good quality and had no problems with the desecant dryer rebuild kit. You have to cut and splice power wires from compressor to the OEM connector. I used waterproof butt connectors with heat shrink due to the location behind the rear wheel. After replacement, I was supprised how quiet it is. I can't even hear it running when sitting in the drivers seat. I am very pleased with the product quality and delivery. I just hope that this one will last longer than the original. I couldn't be any happier.
B0016VIUU4|5|Exactly as described and fits perfectly
B004VR08IW|5|Great purchase for the price!
B001C8WOH6|5|These went on my 2012 VW CC sport, 2.0 front wheel drive.  Perfect fit, and they came with the wear sensor for the drivers front.  You do have to drive 100 miles to wear off the red coating, it polishes the surface of the rotor, then you feel the improved bite of the actual pad.  A bit pricey, but as I do the work myself, it wont ever have to be done again.  This is my daily driver and they have a bit of squeal as I just come to a complete stop.  Nothing I cant handle, but the factory pads were totally silent.  More friction, better stopping, a bit of noise.  Took less than an hour to do the complete job, with a small floor jack and hand tools.  If you turn your own wrenches, you likely upgrade when you replace.  This is a good choice!
B0083VBDF4|5|The greatest item I purchased for my HD. Holds my Heritage classic softail upright for easy cleaning waxing ets.  Even ue it for quick oil change. No fear of the bike falling over. A great product . I would highly recommend it.  When taking the bike out of the stand if it is a heavy machine like mine.  I push down on handle bars and release it quickly to allow bike to pop up then hold front brake and push down again. This will spring mike up once more, which will roll the bike completely off with no jaring effect.  If I can do it anyone can.
B00FZDT684|5|Really good quality and great price.
B000Q0K5SQ|5|Great product. Installed in about 45 minutes. The dreaded GM clunk is gone in our 2003 Suburban. Should have changed it out sooner. Great price on Amazon.
B00AEXO4YG|5|Shipped fast easy install looks great
B008JPK77E|5|Very good
B000C9RSWW|5|fits is right on.thanks.as a fixing person a part needs to arive on time on the box.so i did.hello.thanks.alll day.
B0018EV9R0|2|As I had received everything on time, I'm saddened to say after the first rain that was it for this suit. Whoever says this holds up in a rain storm is wrong. On a half hour ride my crouch was drenched and even wearing another jacket underneath this one my chest was wet as well. I had went by some reviews saying the had driven through 300 miles of rain and were fine. Don't see how that was possible. I stayed dryer not wearing the pants and wearing jeans. Maybe I got a defected pair, but I'm stuck with the now where they rest in the closet. I had to buy me something else which I had paid $185 dollars for and I can say u get what u pay for. I am bummed though.
B0002SQXOM|5|i took my car to a garage for a tuneup they wanted $500.00 plus parts & labor the $500.00 was for them to hook up a scanner to the diagnostic plug. i paid $285 for my autoxray 6000 and found out i needed a radiator cap got one at wal-mart $18.99.checked a friends car had a bad tranny sensor,can't charge a friend.
B008AF765Y|5|Great looking lights, easy to install...I have no complaints!
B005H12QXG|5|Fit perfectly, found installation instructions on youtube.  Shipped very quickly too!
B000KKXP20|5|Install kit was just as described fit was perfect, and looks great in pickup. Would recommend to any Dodge pickup owner.
B000CNJBPU|4|I am installing this in a 1946 Ford 1/2 ton pick up.  Haven't installed it yet, that is why I am giving it 4 stars.  This lines up perfectly in the spot I picked for it and it gives me back my glove box, which use to be occupied be a heater from a 1970 mustang. The plenum gives me defrosters as well.  After the motor is installed, from what I've read, I'm sure this will get 5 stars.  A Perfect fit for my application!!
B001DUHZ1I|5|Fits 2006 LS2.  Best price by far on amazon. Very complete head set.  No timing cover gasket or oil pan gasket or head bolts.  Buy the bolts separately - you will need 2 sets.
B000PJED72|5|Best dry lubricant out there, I used it on my sliding glass doors and my garage hinges.
B00YDDT9IO|5|I'm very satisfied with this product, it fits and looks perfect on my 2008 Mazda 3. Very stylish, good quality piece. Inside the package was a lot of installation instructions so I installed it in less than 3 minutes.
B0017LQT0G|5|[[ASIN:B0017LQT0G Cadillac CTS Windshield Sunshade Custom Fit 2008 2009 2010 2011 In Stock]]              In reference to all of the heat we have had this summer, this sunshade is by far one of the best I've ever owned.  It is constructed very well and is not at all flimsy.  It is custom fit to fill all the windshield.  Easy to work with.
B004LKDCY6|4|I own several Digital,Analog and Lab Type Multimeters. I bought my Etek as an extra meter because of the good price and features. This is a fairly rugged meter with decent accuracy. It has a nice pop out stand to keep it in the vertical position. The AC/DC volt reading are pretty fast, Ohms readings are a little slow. It has a 250V 500mA Glass Fuse and the cover is easy to remove to change a fuse and the battery compartment is easy to open with one screw with a threaded insert, which is good. The Non-Contact AC Voltage Detector works good, just hold it close to a 120V  receptacle, switch or a power cord and the buzzer will sound if voltage is present. It has a back light on the display that will stay lit for about 7 seconds after you push the Yellow Button on the panel. It also had a LED Light in the front that is activated by a red button on the front panel that is handy if you are working on something and need a temporary light but it goes off when you release the button.I would recommend this meter for checking electric plugs, switches and appliances around your home and finding electrical problems on your vehicle but not for precision electronics work were high accuracy is an issue.
B0002NIM7I|5|Great Buy! Real leather and fairly easy to install it. It took the 2 of us to put it on.
B00513G82U|2|the box itself was just fine, where it went down hill from there was the predrilled holes were not lined up with the top rack, and no directions were supplied for the bottom supports i have parts that i have no idea what their for and they need to sell a unit that doesnt come with a back rest.
B004H73J6E|4|Long story short, for the price it isnt bad, but you get what you pay for. The sizing seemed to run a little big. I typically wear a medium and this almost fell off of my head. It had a very strong smell of ether that was so strong I could smell it the moment I cut open the tape on the box. It was almost intolerable when I put it on. The flip of face piece isnt terribly smooth but it did its job just fine. A tad flimsy is all. The flat black paint job was surprisingly decent especially for such a low cost helmet.<br /><br />I rated 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the strong smell it had. For the price it isnt a bad starter helmet.
B004QNYQK2|5|Great just what I wanted.
B004RCX17G|5|AAAA++
B00BEKR27E|3|It fits the 2015 Genesis trunk lid if you cut off the round tab and just use the oval. Looks pretty good too. The wing logo they recommend for the 2015 does not fit at all. You would have to cut off both tabs to use it
B000CITK8S|5|Easy to install - does it's job well. Simple operation.. Plug it in.. let it do it's job. Too easy.
B0088JI5PC|4|ordered wrong number. they sent full size mount ,I have a mid size Polaris . just got out grinder cut notches to make it  fit. works great . bolts  needed to be up graded . did that on mounting plate to machine only ,rest of bolts fine.
B001E1INRQ|4|Worked fine. Had some other issues with our system tho so don't really know what failed.
B004AIJ0W2|1|The good,  the tank looks well constructed and was a exact fit.<br /><br />The bad,  the tank is white in color unlike the OEM which was clear.  This makes it hard to see the coolant level if you are using the gold coolant.<br /><br />The ugly,  the cap will not seal the tank.  The cap gasket will not seal the tank because it starts doing the over torque &#34;clicking&#34; long before the cap gasket has a chance to seat.  Called Dorman and they said they have never heard of that problem and they want me return the whole tank assy. to Amazon.  The old OEM cap fits and seals prefect, so I will use it instead of messing with this any further.<br /><br />Update:  I am moving this to one star.  The factory cap and a aftermarket Stant cap would not seal seal this tank.  Ordered a second one from Amazon and it did the same exact thing.  There is something wrong Doman's cap and also the filler neck on the tank assy.  Sent both of them back and bought a OEM which solved the problem.
B00N5BAWYK|5|Let me begin with this: I drive a 2011 Hyundai Sonata. I originally purchased the same specifications from JDM Astar and they did not fit correctly. They were decently bright, but nothing too special..<br />Since they did not fit, I returned them and bought these. These fit PERFECTLY, were very easy to install, and are without a doubt brighter than the JDM Astars by a good bit. I would highly recommend these lights! They are about as pure of a white light as I could have asked for.<br /><br />I can not say how the customer service is for this company, as I have not had to use the customer service. But I feel like that should be taken in a positive way :)
B00C7XTAFO|5|Gift for son and his WRX. He's happy!
B00KC8D2BO|4|Cool sticker to put on my truck!
B00BPC54M6|5|Excellent decal. Sticks well to all surfaces.
B00LBA6N8Q|5|They fit my 02 diesel great,  looked good, and are Slightly better that clear stock 2nd Gen headlights.  They are worth the little extra money than the other aftermarket ones!
B008SY9TK2|1|Leaks gas through vent hole
B000C5BN72|5|Great buy super
B00852684M|1|They shipped three pair, and not a single one worked. Not even a flicker!
B009TI5B3U|4|I like it...especially the suction cup power. It could of also came with a dash mount adhesive disc.
B00IN5BS4G|5|i bought these struts i did not open the box yet<br />but every thing looking good so far thy come in on time i really love<br />that price where great thanks for your fast service.  Roy ct
B005G6J3EM|5|Bought this for myself for my birthday. Looks great on my car; exactly like in the picture. And you can't go wrong with the price- very inexpensive.
B004MNKS4Y|4|The color matches my Lincoln MKS. The applicator (pen-like) is a little funky. I found that I would put some paint into a chip, then smooth with a finger.
B007SCJGBW|3|the product does exactly what it says. I would've like to have seen a thicker vinyl used for durability. thanks
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Great for my Carport where the Tar surface kind of soft, so my kickstand for my Kawasaki Vulcan 500 would<br />dig into the surface... This pad solve the problem. Very Durable hard plastic.. very happy with the product,<br />delivery came fast too.
B000VJR3GO|5|My black engine casing as well as the fins on the heads were looking spotty and greyish. This stuff with a simple spray here and there turned everything black again. No rinsing off needed. It sprays clear and leaves a shine on anything. No need to even worry about getting it on chrome.<br /><br />This stuff is slick, so do not put on brakes, tire treads, and perhaps your floorboards or pegs. If you want to put it on your sidewalls, spray on a rag and wipe it on to avoid spray getting on the treads.<br /><br />So if you were like me and your engine is looking grey get this spray.
B00G70F5TS|5|Great helmet just make sure u have tried the size of the helmet u want on first Meaning in shoei other helmets fit different just saying.
B004R3BPQ4|5|First, let me say that the hitch is very well made from what I can tell. It is well crafted and a simple design which is effective, two things I personally love. It shipped quickly and arrived in a timely manner with all parts. The installation instructions are perhaps a little confusing, but I don't know of a better way for them to have made written instructions. My main suggestion here is to find a video online (there were a few for the CRV) of the installation process to make the installation clearer.<br /><br />We have a 2002 Honda CRV. This hitch went right on although some of the fits were a bit tight. This wasn't a hitch issue but more of a CRV issue since the place the hitch bolts to is a little difficult to get to. We had to basically make a path to the bolts and then slide the hitch through that path. It might sound worse than it was. My wife and I are not mechanics and still got this installed in a few hours, with 30 minutes to an hour of this being the result of finding tools, figuring out which tools to use, etc.<br /><br />We installed it and have pulled a trailer several times without any problems, including a vacation trip of about 8 hours each way pulling a trailer.<br /><br />Make sure you get a wiring kit, this hitch doesn't come with one. I know this was mentioned in the text, but it bears repetition.<br /><br />Very satisfied.
B0007XUZIC|5|Got this hoping it would make it easier and more convenient to climb in and out of the back of my Tahoe. It does the job. it is very well made, and folds up or down easily but stays in position well. Folded up it is very low profile and doesn't get in the way at all, and folded down the step is large enough to be convenient and secure but not so large that it's something you are going to trip over. This is a really well designed hitch accessory.
B00A61VJF8|5|I got this mask for a Halloween costume (dead bird for Dia de Los Muertos). It was too perfect for that. It was well made and was as pictured. It fit great and looked very neat, actually neater than shown. I imagine it would be functional for bike riding.
B00E9FSFA4|5|Fit perfectly on the 2008 Honda Civic Hybrid I ordered it for. What a difference it makes in the driving experience to have my reception back!
B003W5NWKA|5|Great coverage for the big Fiesta windshield, and keeps the interior much cooler!  It's worth the trouble of rolling up and unrolling.
B007ZDFKFK|5|Good product(s)
B005KQUQ5I|5|This keeps the wind off my chest but allows it to hit me at my head/helmet without the buffiting I was getting from my other windshield.  It makes the long rides easier by keeping the wind pressure off the chest.
B0021IAPMC|5|Worked for what I needed shipped fast
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Excellent fit for my 1999 Toyota Camry. Shipped fast. Great customer service. A little difficult to put back on occasion. I have my doubts of the stitching on the pouch that you receive to put the shade in. If not for that would recive 5 Stars. Otherwise, EXCELLENT product to purchase.
B000C41HT2|5|for the price i would buy again!!
B00DGCP0OK|5|I bought this for a friend. It's good value for money, probably the least priced in this category that will deliver up to par
B008JQ1AN8|4|perfect fit
B002CURUBI|5|easy to install, even matched the wiring code of my bike, works perfectly, great product
B0041FCNU0|5|I installed them in lawnmower rims and they went right in place, no leaks work great, make sure you lube them before installing them!
B004L02ZXA|5|These product are great and easy to install and they are clean come with full kit, fog lamp ,bulbs, wiring harness, and + switch control.
B002YKHBZG|4|This product has always worked very well for me.
B00O6WPVXY|5|Use ac Delhi for duramax engine.  Injectors are fussy on this truck.  Filter is great quality and cheaper than dealer.  Thanks
B00EDL8P5O|4|they look great on my truck but I don't like the clips clip the lens to the headlamps and the side markers did not Fit plus there's no instructions other than that it was good
B00CC4LX2G|5|I received 2 LEDs and lots of adapters. I was worried I wouldn't have the right adapter, but I'm glad they gave me 3 different ones. Honestly not that hard to install, watching youtube videos helps though. I installed under 10min. Works perfect and lights up the inside nicely. The one and only con is the LEDs aren't very secure... The adhesive sticks for a couple of weeks but then falls off. Other than that, great product!
B006GIG74S|2|When i received the lights I was super excited to try them but I open the box that was wrapped really good just to find out the wires that run to one of the lights were pulled out and the light would not work so now I cant use any of them and now I have three lights I can't do anything with I should of bought something else at least I would be able to use it right now!
B001O128SG|5|Finally got those lifts replaced, easy to install and plenty strong enough to hold the lift gate up. No more slamming!
B0086PJSPY|2|Would love to get another to replace the 3 months old one my husband broke when dropping 2' from the carpeted floor (yeah, Custom Werks, that's a nudge for you), but Custom Werks couldn't be bothered to respond to my e-mails. Beautiful pen, but paying $12-15 for a pen that lasts only three months, and absolutely NO customer service to stand behind their product? Definitely not worth my repeat business.
B000BZMBIS|3|The \\"Brembo\\" brake rotors I received for my '84 Chevy K10 truck were manufactued by two different suppliers. Although they were identical in physical appearance they carried markings on each that were different, one made in Canada (Good) the other with no markings (probably China, Tiawan crap). For this reason, I was somewhat disappointed with the \\"Brembo\\" rotors.
B00ELO8YYU|4|Love them, they are very bright and the color is true to the picture.  Have them in a 2011 JK for all interior lights.
B005J68N9A|5|Order came very quickly and it was packaged in a quality fashion.  Item looks great !!! Thanks.
B00029XGQ4|5|Prompt delivery,  good hardware, bench tested to hear this item and will be very happy when it replces the weak original product.
B0031WGQ6Q|4|Works just fine, it's not the roomiest it with a 35 on the spare though, and you have to be careful not to slam the gate open and crush your taillight. Admittedly my taillight was hanging out when that happened....
B004OK77L2|5|Works very well and is fairly fast. Very easy to install as it replaced a jack that quick working.
B00Q0TIGSS|5|Very pleased, I don't know if they're as good as the Harley lights but at half the price I'm very thrilled. The white color and far reaching beam make the night ride far less treacherous. I've already recommended them to others. You might want to add a frenched trim ring to cover the headlight as it sticks out beyond the stock trim ring.  This is my first review ever...I like them so much I wanted others to know.
B0009ZEW0U|5|My first \\"permanent\\" air filter was for a seldom used, performance car.  It was essentially a one-time purchase for the car.  I was pleasantly surprised how noticeable the improvement was in the breathing of the engine.  One-by-one I replaced the filters in all of my cars with these types.  When you plan on keeping the car for a while, used slightly or often, the cost of the filter becomes cheaper than a periodic replacement of a paper filter.  The performance, and possibly gas mileage improvements are definitely worth it.  If you use the filter for more than 50K miles, it does need to be cleaned, but the benefits still outweigh the inconvenience of this job.  I would recommend any permanent air filter over the paper ones.
B001TIS3K6|5|It worked great .Before we got the wineguard we had so much trouble setting up satellite dish. This was so easy .
B001CJHU9W|1|never received it. the package was empty when I got it
B00BT1UNR4|5|I was given this horn for Christmas, and installed it the very next day. A little over a month later and they it is still going strong. Contrary to what the instructions say, a 25 amp fuse is needed because a 20 amp will blow before the 4th note hits. You also need a lot more hose than is supplied, depending on how far it is from the compressor to the horns.<br />Overall: I would definitely reccommended this horn to any true southern folk out there
B0023VB6JS|1|This headlight does not fit a 2001 Chrysler Sebring Coupe. Disappointing. Has some large extrusions which prevent it from being properly installed.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|First of all, the customer service from JACO Superior is beyond phenomenal.  After I bought the gauge, their co-founder personally contacted me by e-mail to ask what I thought of it.  I know it wasn't a robot message because when I responded, he personally wrote back to address my comments. When does that ever happen?  As to the gauge, I bought it because I was tired of inaccurate tire pressure gauges.  I bought a digital gauge thinking it was high tech, but the thing wouldn't give the same pressure reading twice in a row, so I took it back and decided to stay with the tried-and-true technology of an analog gauge.  Of course not all analog gauges are accurate either (e.g. the one I got from Harbor Freight)  but I liked the ad copy about the quality and accuracy of the JACO gauge, so I took a chance.  When it arrived I had just gotten back from having the tires rotated on my SUV and the tire shop had checked the air pressure on all of the tires and recorded it on the work order.  They use Snap-On gauges that cost ten times more than the JACO gauge.  I rechecked the tires using the JACO gauge and got an identical reading to the tire shop, dead on.  Score!  Finally a tire gauge I can trust!  Other features I like are the angled swivel head and the bleeder valve.  The swivel head allows me to see the face of the gauge no matter where the tire valve happens to be, and the angle design allows the gauge to be used on bike tires where a straight gauge won't work because the spokes are in the way. When pressurizing a tire I like to over pressurize it a bit then bleed down to the desired pressure.  That way I only have to connect the air compressor to it once.  The JACO gauge is ideal for this.  I can remove air from the tire by depressing the bleeder valve without removing the gauge from the tire. When the bleeder button is released, the gauge instantly resumes the air pressure reading (unlike the digital gauge I bought that had to be removed from the tire and reset for each new reading).  I may be old school, but I like being able to read an analog gauge.  You know where you stand with an analog.  The only comment I had in responding to the co-founder's e-mail was that my 65-year-old bifocalled eyes found the gauge dial to be a bit small.  It is 1-1/2&#34; diameter.  I suggested that a 2&#34; dial would be easier to read ,yet still compact enough for glove box or tool box storage.  Guess what?  He wrote back to say that they are working on just such a gauge.  It will have a maximum scale reading of 60 psi, perfect for car tires (but not for high pressure bike tires).  That one will be easy to read, even for me.  So I am glad to have the small gauge because I do have a bike to use it on, but I am looking forward to the larger gauge when it comes out.  I plan on getting one of those, too.  They said it will show up on Amazon when it is ready, so stay tuned!new reading).  I may be old school, but I like being able to read an analog gauge.  You know where you stand with an analog.

B004UBRU4O|4|This kit was perfect for my car (had to make a few modifications due to my car being European) But other than that its perfect. Extremely bright and white with hint of blue(dint really want the blue tint but still bright and white)
B003S8CD10|5|Bought 3 keys for my 2007 Corolla. Took them in to my local dealer and the dealer cut and programmed the keys for $20. The original price was $30 but because the 2007 Corolla can only program a fixed number of keys, the techs went meticulously through the process. So the dealer took $10 off for making me wait 30 minutes longer than they had estimated. *Note* there is a limit on the number of keys that can be programmed. I have 5 master keys programmed to my 2007 Corolla.
B008BMN8X0|5|Installed these on my toyota rav4 and they look awesome, the light makes the license plate look sweet. Defiantly stands out
B000SXCLIS|4|This did cover the product and, a reasonable price.  Item isn't a heavy gauge so if this will be used in a very hot climate, then a heavier one may be needed.  Thank you.
B0007ZDRT4|5|A perfect prep for the Liquid Glass polish. Liquid glass recommends you use this prior to using the wax / polish and so do I. This product helps clean off bugs, bird droppings, tree sap on a used or neglected /dirty car and gives you a nice polished look and makes the paint or clear coat slick, clean and ready for the Liquid Glass protective top coat polish. Not only do I use this Pre-cleaner on a older car but I use it with a brand new clear coat car finish as well.<br /><br />For me, I just use this product one time on a newer car or an older car to prep the paint and then just keep my car washed using  Liquid Glass car wash and then add top coats of Liquid Glass polish after every few washes. I use both the Liquid Glass Polish  ( the metal can stuff ) and or the &#34;top shelf&#34; Liquid Glass, Carperfect Carbon/PTFE polish to get my desired results that all starts with this Pre-cleaner.  I do top coat often so the paint ( or the paint protection )  never degrades and this way I have only needed to prep the paint on my cars using this pre-cleaner one time and just keep adding layers of polish or protection.<br /><br />I have used many expensive cleaners, prep and polishes over the years but I find using this pre-cleaner and then a few coats of Liquid Glass polish top coat  its simply the best combo in the auto finish business.<br /><br />All things Liquid Glass is simply the best stuff you will find for your ride!
B0028JPECA|5|Bought three of these so far...they work great.  The best part is that the outlets face to the side and they don't interfere with drink holders on the console.  I installed them in a Toyota Prius and Tacoma pickup.  They appear to be well made and I'm glad that I got them.  Read my other reviews...it's rare for me to give a product 5 Stars.
B002ZBPXGS|5|This really makes the leather seats clean and shiny.  Easy to use.  I didn't think the seats were very dirty, but using the cleaner really pulled up a lot of hidden dirt.
B0000AZ85J|5|Excellent.  Looks great, accurate readings. Easy to wire, instructions easy to follow.  Just a great buy. Would recommend to anyone with even novice skills.
B0067ECS6W|5|Outstanding
B00DV3Y03Q|4|Good disposable product.  Just minor issues with size and ability to breath.  Recommended if and when you are storing your car in a storage facility or painting close to your car.
B003FOXOZG|5|I bought this for my little sister who loves the San Jose Sharks! She got a new car and thought it would be such a good idea. SHE LOVED IT!
B00BHD63CS|5|Stuck on really well...solid, thick and good quality. Won't fall off when washing even through the drive through car wash. Go for it!!
B00837HEAG|5|Fits like a glove,don't even have to Velcro it down.
B0002MBKAK|5|would like to revise my review of this vender, he is trying to make things right on my order, and I appreciate that. Thank you.
B009IFIADM|5|👍👍👍
B00TQZV3VA|3|Nice but not the same design as pictured.
B008RZPFR8|5|excellent product.  stay away from Fly products, very poor compared to these.
B002XL4X66|5|Arrived as describedand on time.  Very heavyweight wheel cover, just what we needed for our trailer parked out in the sun
B00CB8Z6TO|5|Got here quick and they worked great
B002Y079SU|5|I placed these on my phone case and they are absolutely adorable! A great way to personalize a phone or any electronic. I am very pleased with purchase and I highly recommend.
B000BZZURM|5|Worked great!!
B000TMX3X0|5|The seller shipped the item very fast, and that impressed me a lot. The emblem has an OEM feel and look to it. The font, and the embossing of the BMW letters matched the emblem I took off. The part fit right in, and came in a zip lock bag with BMW part number. If you have purchased BMW parts before you know what I am talking about.<br /><br />I recommend this product and this seller.
B003VXG8W2|5|American Autowire 500204 GM HEI Distributor Ignition Terminal<br />Excellent OEM replacement on my 69 Chevy Truck, Only had the push the release tab on the brass terminal end and install the new end. Over the years these get hard and brittle and the plastic keeper lock breaks. This product from American Autowire fits the bill perfect. No more danger of the 12volt or Tach. wires falling off the distributor on my classic Ride.<br />Thanks Amazon for offering a great product from a excellent MFG.<br />Buy with confidence.<br />RagenRat
B000C59LDA|5|I bought these (plus the rears, item #37027) to replace the old shocks on my 99 XJ.  These are a perfect fit and bring the suspension back to OE specs.  Super easy do-it-yourself project with great results.<br /><br />Some key tips on the Jeeps:<br />- Spray all the bolts holding your shocks with PB Blaster to loosen up any potentially stuck/rusted bolts.  Do this a day ahead of time to let them soak, then again before you get started unbolting.<br />- Be EXTRA careful with the upper rear shock mounting bolts.  People have tried loosening these and snapped the bolt head clean off.  If that happens, it's a big problem.  You will need to drill/tap for a new bolt hole, get some welding done, or even get up into the trunk to remove the carpeting and do some floor cutting with a grinder and cutting wheel.  Don't be that guy!  Loosen slowly yet firmly, tighten a bit, loosen a bit, tighten a bit, add more PB Blaster if needed and they should come out.  When re-installing, use some anti-seize on the bolts and do not over-tighten.<br />- The rears do not come pre-compressed.  Get the top partially bolted in, then compress that shock with your best bench press and slide it onto the lower post.<br />- The front driver side upper bolts are blocked by the brake booster/lines and the air box.  Unclamp the top of the air box, move it aside, remove the air filter, then unbolt the bottom half of the air box and remove.  This will allow you to gain access to the upper shock bolt.<br />- I recommend greasing the rubber attachment points (bottom of rear shocks and top of front shocks) with some moly grease when installing.  Won't hurt anything and should keep any squeaks from starting.<br />- Remember to keep the plastic compressor on the front shocks.  Get them bolted in, then cut that plastic piece to let the shock go to ride height.  Seems like a no-brainer, but I imagine you'll have a much harder time if you don't think ahead and cut that first.
B0048J52IE|5|Great product and a great quality.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very Bright
B000H0RCTK|5|Excellent product .  These bulbs perform as well as the factory HID Xenon headlights on my 2005 Corvette!  The low beams outperform most other so called high performance bulb for the high beams!  I would not hesitate to recommend these high quality bulbs to everyone who wants to see farther down the road.<br /><br />Those who have
B00KUR4MOI|5|Looks great and shipped quick
B00IV7OW8U|3|I love the sticker put ordered 2 and only received 1
B00CCWLZB2|5|Sticker says it all and like most of the Obama stickers on my truck, I am sure it will get lots of comments, most good and a few bad. The bad comments I refer to the 2nd amendment stick on my truck as well as the one that says &#34;Nothing in or on this truck is worth dying for&#34;. LOL!
B000AP8ENU|5|works great on my 1998 XJ 4.0
B00J8QNNWY|2|They look well built, but in the end they didn't eliminate the flickering I have with my Zentec HID kit. Also, If you're having problems with them not working at all, (no power to bulb) make sure that the red wire is on the positive side marked on (at least Zentec Ballasts) your ballast.
B008O9DV78|5|Great products and quick delivery received
B004W9AYCE|4|CHROME BASE AIR CLEANER<br />IT WORKS WELL WITH MY ADAPTER THAT FITS ON THE EDELBROCK 4BB THE SHIPPING TIME WAS GREAT, AND IT FITS PERFECT, AND LOOKS GREAT! HOWEVER A WEEK LATER, THEY SHIPPED ME ANOTHER ONE? THIS IS LIKE A SEVEN DOLLAR ITEM, SO IS IT WORTH SENDING BACK? I JUST DON'T HAVE A NEED FOR A SECOND ONE.
B0017GTOQC|1|Installed fine....first rain storm and the label washed off. WTF! A piece of cheap crap, you will be sorry. I wouldn't recommend you waste your money.
B0030V6XW0|5|Flitz does a good job protecting and polishing my polished nickel faucet and hardware.  It is expensive. But I haven't found any other products that protect as well.
B005EIH2RC|5|Item as described, quick shipment and product as expected, much better than cheap looking stickers. Would recommend buying without worries. Good stuff!
B00ASOEOCI|5|My boyfriend ordered these for his dirt bike that he bought a couple weeks ago....one of the many parts he will be ordering from Amazon for his bike
B00RUDYQV4|5|Nice look, nice fit.
B00139YMUQ|5|Love this product.  When my car warning lights states my tire is low.  I pull this tool out of my glove department and plug it into my tire to see what the numbers are indicating.
B003SHA4BM|5|Perfect
B00ESBOL3E|4|ok.
B002LBKG5K|5|Could not be happier with these mats..sturdy, snug fit. Custom-made appearance.  Called Honda to compare, and Honda does not make full-length rear mat that covers hump, but our Husky mats cover the entire span. I read several reviews that mentioned an uneasy fit left of the driver's seat where seat adjustment controls are located...gotta say I just don't agree...snug enough fit there too. Don't even need to pull mats out to clean...we either do a quick vacuum or dump a bit of water directly onto mat (trough-like design prevents spillage), then clean off excess water and debris with cloth. Worth every penny!! Looks custom and always tidy!! 100% happy...product exceeds expectations!!
B005DSRDUE|1|About a week after I bought these, two of the rhinestones fell off.  Not much longer after that, the color faded.
B000BYB1QM|5|My car picked a lot of power back up and installed them myself. Replaced the plugs and wires at the same time.
B00KA0EMDG|4|Great bags, but didn't work for my bike. WAY bigger than you think they will be too. I exchanged them for SW motech, which worked for my bike better but these are still awesome.
B0024NSWJW|2|OK, there website does tell you there is a restocking fee, but there shouldn't be - I returned the unit intact in the box. Why? well, also my bad - these are VERY VERY TIME CONSUMING to install yourself. Beware: You have to drop the front bumper. So I decided to send them back and polish my headlights (again). IF you can get someone to install them, and it would easily take at least 1 hour of professional labor, then go ahead, it's probably a good value.
B006EN65NI|5|cute
B001ODA7Q4|5|Great item to have in your car if you have headers on it. Problem was getting a set that was not broken at the tip. Three times is a charmer with Amazon, that is how many times it had to be delivery, then I ordered a set for a friend and the same again, returned and gave up.
B004TBOG10|5|Works very well for small dings and scratches, basically an exact match in color. When applying: don't apply a lot at once, apply little by little so it blends with the rest of the paint
B00BDQLM9S|5|Did the job.
B007P748Z4|5|work perfectly thank you
B00NYB54AS|4|The carb  works well. I wish I would have known that the choke was manual and that you  are unable to hook up the choke cable
B00COCGFCY|5|This is great for any fan of Parks and Recreation. We wanted something from the show that wasn't a poster and this was just perfect! It's now on my aquarium canopy and looks great.
B007LICNW2|5|Great!
B000EDUUIA|1|The product is OK, just OK.<br />The one star is for the deceiving way of promoting this product.<br />When I order this product it said on the name: &#34; 2 of Camco 44442 AccuPark&#34;.<br />I assumed that the package would include 2 of the stopping strips, for this last reason I ordered TWO packages assuming that I would have 4 stop strips for my two cars.<br />When the package was delivered it only contained ONE per package instead of two.  Needles to say I was disappointed and frustrated.<br />This is so deceiving and bad to the consumer that I am thinking seriously on not buying these type of products from Amazon.
B000CIU5FU|5|I recently used this to replace the old plug in my lawn tractor while perfoming a tune-up. I was pleased at how quick the engine turned over and how it continues to do so even with the drop in temperature. Definitely better than going with the stock plug!
B00IG0C202|1|Are these waterproof?
B001A1MA56|3|Functions reasonably well as a replacement for the oem part. There is a visible gap between the edge of the mirror and the mirror housing. The nut in the housing that secures the bolt to the base is not affixed and can be difficult to reconnect if disassembled.
B005T68GMO|5|so glad to have those awful plastic fenders gone!
B006OQ35GU|5|Works great. No more sticking your head down to hear if the waste is still flowing.
B00BD2TVKO|3|This seat cushion is comfortable enough for a long drive, but it slips around too much on the car seat.
B00JVHLS3G|5|Great emblem, solid, great price. The only thing is that I had to use gorilla glue to stick it. I though it would snap in place or come with some sort of security insert. Very satisfied with the product.
B0017GQLCM|5|this piece was bought to cover a embale of a car i was selling i never really got use from it but it did look and fit great.
B00O27MR44|4|Currently doesn't have all the features for my Jeep that they do for other vehicles such as the guages that come up on the screen and the TPMS. That's the only reason it gets a 4 star rating.
B003FXNCQS|5|This is worth its weight in gold. A super tool for offroaders. Helps air down your tires quickly. Price is better to some name brands and the quality is exactly the same.
B00075XCEO|4|Direction were clear, and the hitch fit perfect, but hardware kit should inlude a set of washers to shim out the connection between the bumper and the frame to make up for the thickness of the hitch bracket.
B003O36H3Y|5|Sticker is bigger than I expected but I still love it!
B002XLGQC0|5|Great item
B000JFHNQA|5|very good last a long time if kept charged properly good strong booster pack
B0019HYQO4|5|They are not metallic, so they don't have the bite you would expect from a performance metallic pad, but I have to say they bite better than any other ceramics I have ever had. They are clean (no dust), super quiet and offer great performance. I driver up to 160 mph in the Autobahn (Germany) on my 6 series and I have to say they don't fade. I'm an aggressive driver and these pads provide excellent feedback and breaking. The best non-metallic pads I have ever had. Metallic = warped rotors, so can't go wrong with these pads if you are looking for non-metallic performance pads. Cons: packaging could be better, include more grease in the package.
B001XX8JXI|2|Have had these on my Silverado for 5months...  Rims have been covered with dust ever since they went on. Wear indicators just started to squeak.  After closer look, the rotors (which used to be in very good shape) are now grooved significantly (not runout, just cut down due to the brakes rubbing) and the pads are almost completely worn down.  This happened only after maybe 8000 miles on these brakes.  During this time, brakes ran hot and would feel soft.<br /><br />Either I have a bad set or these should be used with EBC's high performance slotted rotors, just not good for a Silverado crew cab...  Going back to OEM AC delco setup and will be calling EBC
B000JFHMVQ|4|Have only used it once and seems to work for want I bought it for, decent quality and should last me for ever unless it gets a leak and hopefully that won't happen.<br /><br />Would purchase again if I ever need one.
B00R8QGITG|5|Great product. Already saved a side of the road bill
B00KM84KBA|5|Absolutely the Brightest Lights, I work EMS and they are brighter then the ones on our ambulances. No Problem getting people to move even during the day at night they will almost blind you.. I've had many complements on them.
B000JFN9WW|5|Bought it from Amazon, shipper was quick and came without any issues.  I'm in the Auto parts business.  Only used it once, but it seems to do the job.  I have a few German cars: BMW M3, MB, and a VW.  I used it only on the M3 so far.  It got out 98% of the oil out.  I unscrewed the drain plug to see if there was any oil left and there was probably half a cup of oil left.  I think mainly because my car was in the driveway which had a slight slope, so the oil pan wasn't leveled.  Next time, I'll do it in the garage where it's flat, and I am sure it'll suck out 99.99%.  While my BMW and MB have long oil change intervals (9,000 - 12,000).  I plan to perform oil changes every 5,000 miles w/ Redline Synthetic.  I used to use Mobil 1, but after switching to Redline, the engine is quieter at 80, 90 mph and the acceleration is quicker.  No joke.  Plus these extended drain intervals have the issue of sludge build up.  Anyhow, this device will save me a ton of $$$ in the future.  No more going to dealer or other shops to change oil.  2 oil changes will pay for the Mityvac itself.  Only problem I have now is that my aircompressor is a small 2 gallon, so while it was ok to produce enough suction, I had to turn the dial to fill the tank a few times.  But that's ok, I will probably get a 10-20 gallon soon.  Yes, the Mityvac is that worth it, in my opinion.  You can buy a quick connect fitting for your air compressor from Lowes which makes it easy to switch between Mityvac and the regular air hose to fill you tires, etc.  So if you're like me, buy your OEM oil filters online for about $5-6 each, and do it yourself.  This way you can use the better oil, save time and money, and do it at your own convenience.  As I get older, I have less time to spend on making appts and taking my car to the dealer or shop to get oil changes and things which I can do myself.  You can buy a quick connect fitting for your air compressor from Lowes which makes it easy to switch between Mityvac and the regular air hose to fill you tires, etc.  Get a Mityvac, I highly recommend!!!
B000C9P3WE|5|After my wife announced that her brake lights weren't working....I called the local GM dealer and was told that this part would cost me $246.00  I was floored by that quote.  So I checked Amazon and found the exact same ACDelco branded part for under $98.00.  I did pay for premium shipping (~additional $19.00) to get it here in two days....and by golly it arrived in two days.<br /><br />The local GM dealer was going to charge me $246.00 for the part plus $153.00 for labor.  A grand total of $399.00 for a repair that I did myself for a total of $117.25 plus about 2 hours of my time.  That little 2 hour job saved me $281.75 When's the last time you earned $281.75 for two hours work ?
B000I8XD9E|5|OK I waited until Winter was over to review this. My guy friends poked fun of me but I knew my 25 yr old Benz would need some  help up here with no garage in the North Woods of Wisconsin. She started EVERY time I used it, which was only when it fell below 0. Now the guys are kinda quiet about the whole thing...
B00C8UKFIM|5|Added 2oz to front and rear motorcycle tires.  Run up to 80mph on a heavy bike and no issues.  Will use again.
B00HJFNOPM|3|it is not an actual different petal. it is a clip on that goes over the old ones. pretty easy to set up. the only problem that i have had so far is one of the corners on the break petal is losing the silver part. it is from where i move my foot from the gas to the break.
B0049GHV3U|4|Fit was slightly off, but if you bolt it in a few threads each at a time it will go into place.
B000C5C862|5|Ford has used these same pads on clutch and brake pedals since the advent of time.<br />They fit the pedals snugly and securely.
B003VDX5D2|5|It was easy to install and it works for me.
B000LDIJ72|5|Not much to say here.  I needed a new battery from my home security system, and this did the job at a good price.
B0024GQZXY|4|I purchased this jumpstarter from a local retailer (I only paid $50 for it). Car is an older Camry. It was sitting dead in a parking lot for 4 months.    This jumpstarter says you need to charge it for 48 hours before first use, but i was on a time constraint so i used it after 24. The unit started the car right up. Used between 25% and 50% of the charge.    The unit itself is small enough for me to easily throw into a backpack or keep in a corner of my car. I don't think the light is necessary but whatever.    The only thing i didn't like was that the AC charger is a two prong plug sticking out of the unit. See that black panel next to the light in the picture? That lifts up and reveals the recessed prongs. If you buy this unit, you will need an extension cord.
B00REJXDJA|5|Easy to install in 10 minutes.  Looks great.
B005H2SHS8|5|Excellent motor oil. Started using it a few month's ago and never went back. Meets the VW 502 00 standard.
B000I8XD0S|3|I'm still trying to get this heater to work...I don't want it on all the time, so I have it set up on a timer.  So far, 45 minutes on does not do much to get my heater going right away in the morning for the drive to work.    Installation was a pain for me. I have a compact car, so space was limited for me to work.  It needs to be installed on the lower radiator hose, as close to the water pump as you can get.
B006FLMGZA|5|No manual but you can simply go to youtube site and search on how to install it.. it's pretty easy, even my 12 year old daughter can do it..<br /><br />All you need to have;<br />- Clean, dry, and lint free wipe<br />- Alcohol (for cleaning surface)<br /><br />I tried it during rainy days and I'm satisfied with it...
B006FJDBNI|5|Worked as advertised. Problem free install.
B000CIV6HQ|5|I put this on my '04 Grand Prix GTP.  Before the only modification to the exhaust was a factory resonator delete pipe.  This kit came with a Dynomax resonator, intermediate pipe, y-pipe, two Dynomax mufflers, and 3.5\\" stainless slash tips.  I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of installation and the overall quality.  This is the best value out there if you want to get a cat-back on your Grand Prix.  All other brands are almost double the price, if not higher.
B00063XX5U|5|recommend for the everyday mechanic.  a must have in your toolbox.  takes some getting used to but easy to use.
B000C32J6S|5|ive gone through 3 belts in 3 months, until i got this on a G8 GT with some pretty spirited driving, Hasn't slipped and is noticably quieter than any other belt i used.
B005TTZLE2|5|Awesome body lift had all required parts and step by step instructions for anyone to be able to successfully install. The quality of the parts are equal or better than stock. I added the body lift to my 5.5 Rubicon Express long arm suspension lift and it has drastically improved the required space around my transmission and exhaust system. I would highly recommend this purchase.
B00C598KQ0|5|Added these to my Jeep with black wheels. Looks great!
B006P898Z4|5|This pic does not do justice, until you have it in your hand. Great stitch work and easy to apply to a vest of any kind. I will recommend for all my biker friends and family.
B00CIVE9HE|5|Perfect fit.  Looks better than original.
B009MIQICU|5|Love it!!
B003FO2O1G|5|EVERYTHING WORKED FINE
B00F1KBKYE|5|Great fit!
B006GGI6P8|5|Came in when promised. Easy to install. Very happy was correct one for my car and didn't have to send back.
B001JT1IPM|4|This bag is the perfect size but what I really like about it is all the compartments. The leather is soft and not tight or hard like some other bags I have used. This packs easily with other luggage. Another thing I have noticed with cheaper bags is if hey get the slightest bit wet they leave dye behind. This one I got wet and it didn't stain the counter. Great little bag!
B0090VSY0I|1|Was hoping these would be good for turn signal and running lights in my Volvo.  They are very dim and get extremely hot.
B000G28PPE|4|could not use it yet.. I did not buy new calipers to install, I changed my stock rotor discs and puds with high performance and look ones.. but could not finish my projects yet, economy...the kit has everything you need, the can with the paint is 4 OZ it looks a bit on the small side so I am not sure if I could do all 4 calipers.. I both this although you can go to auto zone  or auto parts and get a cheaper one because the paint should be a better quality...sorry I could not be more helpful
B005CAISOS|5|It's hard to tell about durability because I've only had it a little short of a month but it's perfect so far. It hasn't chipped or peeled off or anything, and it was very easy to put on.
B004W9MZX0|1|Seam ripped on install -  need to remove it every time it gets wet - so - living in Costa Rica, where it rains for 8 months out of the year, this is a daily routine. save your money unless you live in a desert -  poor construction and weak seams.
B00BNFW0MC|5|This wheel was exactly what I was looking for. And it was at a great price!<br />All in all wonderful exchange and shipped sooner than expected.
B000C23EGI|4|OK - Its not Bosch. So if you are expecting Bosch quality, you are mistaken (even if the quality is perceived instead of factual). Then again, its not 15 bucks each (its 15-25% of that). I started using Autolite platinum about 5 years ago after being in a bind, and not being able to find a place open on a Sunday that stocked Bosch, and having a Bosch plug that suddenly quit working in my Volvo S80. I, sceptically, bought this type of Autolite and used it and was unexpectedly surprised. I guess dont knock it till youve tried it. Been using Autolite Plats ever since (This purchase was for my Mercedes). They do the job, and they do it well. Never had a problem. Lasts just as long. Gets fouled the same as Bosch, and it costs so much less.
B001XOVIQM|5|Work as advertised and look nice in my RV.
B004D2ZQ8M|1|This product did not  fit for a 2014 model (Carmaro) at all very disappointed and I tried to send it back to the seller and never got a response still have them in my closet and no use for them
B00RGZWIW0|5|This is an extremely well designed, sturdy, well made, and highly practical product;  'purchased 2 of these, and hope that they become available again.  Super quality.
B000JZFVBO|4|After installing this air kit, I believe it will live up to my expectations.  I haven't driven the car enough to make an accurate evaluation of it's performance, but it has increased the pep my car has.  The instruction sheet could be a little more clear, because the parts diagrams were kinda confusing.  The sheet said approximately 90 mins. to install, I did it in 45 mins.  If the diagrams would've been better, i probably  would have completed the install in 20 -30 mins.
B00KTJ3ZMW|1|One key was shorter than the other and shorter key did not work the plastic hit on ignition an it would not turn horrible
B004KB83Z4|5|This is very bright and clean looking. Love the features too.
B0013REXSO|5|As described
B001EOV3JS|5|I bought this T-connector to use on my 2006 Tacoma.  The installation was as simple as removing a few screws, plugging in the connectors and mounting the ground wire and box.  The installation was very quick to do as well.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone.
B0051D3MP6|5|Great product. Works as intended. Been using for 2 months now and keeps the batteries to my boat tended perfectly.
B000JFN9WW|3|I bought this in January 2015 by the end of march 2015 it has already clasped, I contacted mighty vac and amazon is not a authorized dealer so they basically told me to kick rocks. 100 bucks down the drain. I recommend getting it form your mac tool guy paying the extra money to have<br />a warranty. the extractor works very well I was unhappy with how long it lasted and the customer support from mighty vac.
B009I6BEDY|5|i am very satisfied thank you very much.
B007GDRDFE|5|Wa very please with this item
B001D23RMM|5|works good
B00KTHSR8Q|5|Works great, perfect fit to replace my broken one!!! Thanks!!!
B000AMXSUM|4|I bought these headlights for my 93 Jeep Wrangler.  They are about 20% brighter than my stock units.  The extra light is nice, but the extra cost may not be worth it.  Hopefully, these lights will have a long life span which will help justify the price difference.
B004D330YI|2|I like the colors green and black, and I wore them to work as a driver. Driving is not that abusive to gloves, but these did not last long. They did not last three months. I got them March 12th and by the time April was over the holes began to appear.<br /><br />I usually wear a medium size glove, but their medium was too small so I returned for a large. The large was a little too big but at least I could wear them.<br /><br />I am still in search of gloves that will fit and last, these are not the gloves for me.
B0002LBGX2|5|I applied the product and in worked perfectly. No more white stuff on the rubber. The finish was first class
B00GF5TG9K|5|Nice quality & appears sturdy.  Since it has no &#34;swivel&#34; parts, I anticipate that it will be durable.
B000WJA5F4|5|its RAM stuff!!!!  what else can I say?  simply the best!
B004IARG2I|5|The filter is massive compared to my old Spectre.  Installation is a bit of a pain, but the instructions get you through it pretty easily step-by-step.  After installing it, the engine did sound more aggressive but then it went back to its original noise after a few hours.  The advantage that this filter has over the other intake systems is the intake tube that sucks in air from the inlet ducks on the hood scoop.  It allows cooler air to flow inside the manifold, which makes the oxygen more dense during combustion, which is what you want.
B001IZIG6G|2|This cover tore in two days. It ripped under the bunkhouse. They missed stitching on part of it.  I have email Camco and we will see how they stand behind their product.
B002R1QLQM|5|Very, very good replacement head-light! And the price is much better than paying $253.00 (for one head-light) at the chevrolet dealership and carmax! Car looks really good with its new eye.
B000KIP53O|5|When it arrived last week, I went out to my '01 Cr-V, removed the old spare tire cover and slipped this one right on.  It went on with ease and looks really nice.  I'm really happy I went with this option instead of a more expensive one.
B001L4TRXU|5|This is great. You do have to remove the snap on the 'tail' strap, usually on the right side. If your snap doesn't remove easily, cut the strap immediately inbound from the snap, if your strap is long enough to accommodate weaving through the buckle fitting.. Cut with a very sharp scissors and then 'seal' the cut end with a light touch of a flame to eliminate loose threads. After threading the strap through the 2 slots at the back of the male end of the quick release, finish 'cauterizing' the cut end of the cut strap to insure that there will be no unraveling.<br />Yes, the strap adjustment may loosen when this is unbuckled, but in my experience, it does not loosen when this is buckled and the chin strap is properly adjusted to start with.<br />Happy Riding.
B000BO8EBM|1|The image is not the same product I received. You are misleading the consumer. This can bring you a lot of liability.<br />I am very dissapointed.
B00JA1BRK2|5|Installed this header on our 2005 Nissan Altima 2.5 to get rid of the infamous pre-cat manifold that internally fails and causes catastrophic engine failure.  This header in conjunction with the Blox Racing BXFL-00108 Check Engine Light Eliminator Adapter has alleviated concerns of engine failure, looks really nice, has increased horsepower, and best of all no annoying check engine light...
B001QT9KO6|4|this seals almost any leak no matter what size or where it is
B000TCCWS2|5|good and easy to isntall
B000GU5IUQ|1|Don't be fooled by the cheap price. \\"chrome\\" flaked upon first use. Rust with just drops of water. Don't stay tight . look horrible.  Poor decision.
B000BUOSGG|5|This one is really very nice dish rack. I am really enjoying this product very much. keep up the good work.
B00N65CS8I|5|Love it. Good size, and for sure a eye catcher.
B00G6SVRWU|5|Thank you. Item is as described and arrived in a very timely matter.
B0068ER4G0|5|Great looking seat and comfortable on short hops as the name implies
B001UCCNEI|5|Fit like a glove.
B001UOOY02|4|Bought these as I was tired of sanding the fogged over originals every 6 months.  They sure look nice and clean!  With uprated bulbs they give adequate lighting.  Guess that is all we can expect on this truck.
B00AGWEUKI|4|This tool is of decent quality.  And it works.  If you had to use this every day, it probably wouldn't last.<br />But I bought the Decoupler Pulley and this tool for less than the auto stores.<br />But they took 2 days before they shipped this, and stupid fedex held it for a few days.<br />So if you are NOT in a hurry, not a problem.
B00AVEAEKQ|2|Overall, 2 stars because this doesn't fit nice on the front or rear dash or behind a large SUV grill.. Every vehicle has a curved dash or curved headliner with makes this look rigged and not professionally installed. As a last ditch I was going to put it behind the grill of my large SUV. Even though the grill appears flat it is still curved and sets the unit back to far.<br /><br />Also, I am very disappointed in the lack of a quantifiable water rating. Saying it is &#34;rain proof&#34; means nothing. Figure out the true IP rating. Other brands say IP67 or IP72 that actually tells me where it can or cannot go.<br /><br />If you have a 36&#34; long dead flat surface, this will be a 10 star product. Crazy bright.
B004EZFK8O|5|Well made cap-good quality-very pleased!
B00FA34FP8|5|Awesome steps. So much better than the stock ones. Sturdy mounts so they don't wobble
B00EEGG3DE|5|great accessory.. fit pretty good for aftermarket stuff.
B00FSU1TSY|5|Fits true to size. I am 5'11&#34;, 180 lbs, and ordered a large. It fits perfect with a little room to spare to wear a hoodie under for colder months
B00480J4KA|4|Fit well, burns bright, and easy to install.
B007TG7HV8|5|best wiper I have ever used
B000RXKR6M|5|I dont like to stick my hand in it to wash, but it's nice to have a thick cloth to wash the car with. Gets all those little yellow dots that seem to build up on cars and can't beat the price!
B005THTCW6|4|Works great, dog loves it.
B00F47YV3Q|5|Great kit and really easy to install.  Hardest part is to reach the fog light itself.
B000HWPKJC|5|Perfect fit in my truck, readyLift is the ultimate company to buy any leveling kit through, fast shipping and easy install, thanks a bunch.
B006P7LBFK|5|Gootgoot
B004S1WA96|1|The picture showed exactly what I needed, a 5 speed, but the actual item sent was a 6 speed. With dozens to chose from I selected the one that looked right. The written description, however, did say it was a for a 6 speed
B00J21UZWG|5|good product
B00D010TDY|4|I love this stuff.  It was easy to apply and buff off, however, let's be honest, cleaning a sofa, chair, ottoman, and a large footstool is going to get  your arms tired.  I had some corners on the cushions on our leather sofa that were looking dry and faded.  They look beautiful now.  I was surprised and delighted.  We have a dog who, as a puppy, would scratch at the sofa to get to something underneath.  The scratch marks did not tear the leather, but the cleaner/conditioner also didn't get rid of them.  I hoped that it might since it worked so well on the cushions.  The directions do not say it will heal leather, just clean and condition, so it did what it was suppose to do.
B007IJ1YCO|5|I love the fit and function of this bra!  I was on a trip with my wing and someone threw a plastic cup out of their car.  It ended up hitting off of the front of the bike and scratching the windshield.  I should've bought it before it happened.  It saves a lot from scratches and bugs on the front.  I love the way it looks too.  Easy to put on and I would definitely buy it again.
B000BZPSAG|5|My standard rotors were constantly warping, so a local mechanic said these are the rotors made in Italy for racing! Great for my HOT Jaguar! We'll see in 6 months what happens!
B0051D3MP6|5|I own several battery tenders, and bought this to replace one of them, but it ended up replacing two! It comes with both cigarette lighter adapter and battery terminal connector.  As a result, I use it for two bikes in my garage (one has a cigarette lighter adapter in the fairing, and the other bike uses the battery terminal adapter).  It works great and seems to be relatively well built.  The switch that moves it from 6V to 12V moves very easily.  Since I use only 12V for my applications, I taped the switch so it does not slide to the 6V by mistake.
B001TE0IMG|4|i purchased this product so i could have a mobile power pack to run my dj equipment and some low wattage monitor speakers when a generator is not permitted where i plan on playing at like the campsites in some music festivals, but anyways it worked great i ran it for 10 hours straight when i first got it and i had no problems and i still haunt had any and i was using it when it was 108 degrees outside. its very light weight witch is nice since i have it mounted to a box i made that hold 2 group 27 deep cycle batteries but like its claim it will pull a continuos 800 watts with no problems so yes i would buy the product again if i had to do it over again and i would recommend this product to a friend!!!
B00546CNC8|5|works great so far to contain everything in the back of our 08 sequoia!
B00L3LKURI|3|14 Guage? Wire gauge doesn't compare to the 14 I got at napa (though this is much cheaper). This is more a 16/18 gauge in all practicality. Works for the job but if you're looking to carry a lot of current this isn't it
B000C9S966|5|very cool besides my hid lights great for 2005 cadillac sts
B000ALBRJW|5|Bought these and they took about 10 minutes to install on my cherokee and now I don't have to prop up the lift gate.  I wish I would have gotten these years ago.
B003CKFP5K|5|no issues, as described, filled battery up, really didn't need to put it on a charger bc it read gtg but i did so anyways to ensure no issues.
B00CUAWJ6G|5|Same review as for the wash mitt only this is smaller, good size for claying glass and small areas fits the hand nice.
B005Q48HQO|1|This is the worst product in all the F world!!!! it doesn't fit!!!!!! try in every way, the final solution was take my headlights and try to install on my table... i never could, so finally take a decision, cut my original holders and adapt it to my HID... this product goes to trash!
B005TA07Q8|5|I LOVE this decal!  It looks exactly as pictured.  The directions were easy to follow!  Other decals I've tried curled or did not peal off very easily.  This one came off very smoothly with no curling or bubbles.  It also looks GREAT on my car!
B000WMS6DY|4|I have not had an opportunity to really use the ATV with the new rear shock.  I only took it for a short ride and from that I'm currently pleased with it.
B0021YZER2|5|I bought not knowing really what todo, but after I used it man this is really a good product. Any dried up spots on windows that are annoying use this. Use it on your windshield and it's so good, I forget to turn on my windshield wipers in the rain. And it's not slippery like other products like rain x. It's so good that after my friends left it disappeared too. Lol Now that no one confessed, I have to buy again.
B0012TTDN8|5|Used this in shop class as a kid and and I've yet to find anything that performs better. I've used it on everything from lawn mowers to Porches. It's easy to work with and versatile.
B0009V1WR0|5|Bought it for my Honda Shadow. Works perfectly. Easy to put on and take off. Lock mechanism works great and reminder cord is very useful.
B0074OHCOC|5|It Works
B00180HZB8|5|Perfect
B009OBVXC0|5|Works great!
B00GSAUHB8|5|works great
B002SIR91A|5|All aluminum, 3 piece snow shovel, perfect for the back of my Jeep.  It's too small for big jobs around the house but just the right size as an emergency tool.  Price is nice too.
B0091OE6K6|5|Love these! I've used these exact adjusters for several years on my vehicles and they are the best I've found. The seat belt does not slip out from under the hook but it's easy to get in and out. Moving the adjuster on the belt is easy, too.<br /><br />Once you have the adjuster on the belt and locked down, it is pretty difficult to get off unless you have a screwdriver, but that's the whole point, so it stays in place.<br /><br />I have these in all our vehicles, both front and back. One of those low cost gadgets that just make life a little better.
B000KQ0LLC|5|This was the first transmission jack I ever bought and I am really happy. The thing works wonderfully, its light the exact car that I used it for was a transmission in a 2003 crown victoria. As many of you know that transmission is pretty heavy. But thanks
B00MXWFSBY|5|Perfect and very comfortable. Fits over original headrest well, and provides necessary safety element for this driver.<br />Product was delivered quickly, and arrived in excellent condition,
B001GRRCRA|5|WeatherTech makes high quality rugged precision fit products in the USA.  I mistakenly ordered the wrong color and Amazon sent a replacement immediately. Returning my mistake was seamless, painless and free thanks to Amazon's outstanding customer service.  WeatherTech and Amazon are setting exceedingly high standards with regard to product quality and customer satisfaction.  Both companies are true leaders in the global marketplace!
B000MTI15K|5|the installation was fast and worked great for a 12&#34; gas tank. the instruction was great and simple. did not have to adjust any.
B008O5XKNW|5|Fantastic looking key chain, worth the price. Now everyone knows you own a BRZ!
B008IAJPSW|5|Nice look<br />Easy install<br />Need two people
B003ZOLRSM|5|Excellent
B000CSQUEK|5|Great product. Better than stock and better than stock appearance. I would highly recommend this intake manifold bolt kit to anyone.
B001U2DPUE|4|it works very well  very satisfied with product would recomend it to others it isnthe second one that i have bought
B000VKRQ7Y|3|About 3/4 inches too big in depth, but flexible enough to squeeze it into the space. Next time I will buy a house brand from Riebes or some place similar.
B0015PMZMU|5|This is a marvelous tool. For openers, the bar that grips the tubing does not slip( probably the biggest problem with flaring tools) . The die that rounds the bubble is quality .<br />I've had numerous &#34;double flare&#34; tools and they were all terrible. The ISO bubble now is pretty much the standard. In the now rare cases where I run into a fitting that is bubble into double flare, I cut off the double flair and bubble it and then use a bubble/ bubble union joint (couple of bucks).<br />This is a quality tool and well worth the tiny price here on Amazon... Get one and then you tell me
B0041QD182|5|Hubby bought them for my bike at Christmas! Love them!
B005DCKRP8|1|I gave these to my daughter for her birthday on Feb. 17th.  The crystals are already falling off.  Not impressed by the quality.
B00PXC5PNC|3|Was looking for just a cover but this is more than a cap. Had to  cut out part of it. May be more pictures of the inside would have been helpful.
B0033WDH2K|5|Bought this for my GMC Acadia.  I must admit I was really impressed by how easily it installed.  There are instructions on Youtube as well as what came in the box.
B00CDUJCPO|2|These mirrors are a decent design and a good fit, but they are plagued by poor construction.  Although they come from a vendor in the US, the only thing that the vendor seems to provide is a little 'z' shaped bracket that fits between the mirrors and the vehicle and a pair of bolts and nuts to attach these brackets to the mirrors (note to Extreme Metal Products - the bolts are too long and hit the mirrors). The mirrors themselves have &#34;Meixing&#34; embossed into the plastic.<br /><br />I wouldn't have a problem with Chinese made mirrors if the mirrors were anywhere near strong enough for the intended purpose and the price was reasonable for what you receive.  As it is, one good whack from a smallish branch and the mirror mounting arm will break.  These mirrors would be a reasonable value for $20 - 25/pair - $65 a pair is outrageous.  Extreme Metal Products probably pays about $5/pair to the Chinese manufacturer, perhaps spends another $5 for the brackets and hardware and pockets better than $50/pair - a fivefold return on investment.<br /><br />There must be a better alternative for the '14 Ranger 900, but I have not run across it yet.
B001PWFPRU|5|For dodge thinner washer is required but it works awsome.
B00B3A6JOC|1|product came damaged ripped from the sides. Only reason why I didn't return this was because I needed to use it asap so I ignored the ripped part and applied it on my car. Looks ok 8f you can get it to work I have used about half of the product trying to wrap my hood but still no luck.
B003NBFKDK|5|This little carrier does a great job. For the price we paid for it, it was easy to assemble, sturdy, and carried our camping gear quite well.
B004ZF3QXY|5|So far I'm  really pleased with these lights, I got the 12k (deep blue) pair for my 2004 Tacoma. Was very simple to set up (for me without the manual was easiest, looks confusing) but have a decent amount of mechanical experience. Not as blue as I had hoped or saw pictures of, but they are nice and work good. Had it a few weeks now, once with the high beams on my passenger side went out but turned em off and back on and turned back on, since then no problems. Definitely would recommend,  maybe just go one up on the color you actually want to get the perfect one. Bit definitely happy with mine, especially since here in Hawai'i they go for $180.
B003LRJI16|5|I ordered one of these for myself and one for my older brother and I'm not sure if they meant to or not but they doubled my order and sent me four. Pretty awesome surprise and they look pretty cool on my truck and my brothers car.
B008DQV88Q|5|If you have a Jeep jk '07-'15 this should be your first upgrade with bulbs!! Next move on to a wire harness. You will put a lot on light on the road.
B004X5QWAA|2|Normally my minimum review for a product that works is 3 stars, but I had to make an exception in this case.  The construction was exceptionally flimsy with several of the tubes and fins bent, even though the box arrived in pristine condition.  The radiator itself looks like a high-school shop project with sloppy welds on the sheet-metal portions.  The mounting studs were welded on crooked.  The mounting points were made out bolts with 2-3 extra nuts to make them large enough to fit. The handle of the petcock was broken off flush. At first I though it was shipping damage (and not the products fault) except the box showed no sign of mishandling and the broken off parts were nowhere to be seen.  The worst part however, was the universal transmission cooler fittings.  The top fitting was correct, but the bottom fitting required an adapter (included) that was not shaped correctly.  I had to use a sledgehammer to clearance the inner fender enough to make it fit.  That just isn't right.
B00317764W|5|Installed on a 99 Sportster with ease.  I love the feeling of these and the style.  The ribs make perfect finger groves for my size hands.  I'll be buying another set for my new bike (Street Glide)
B001CI4O7E|5|Product worked great. There is a very noticeable power gain especially in the mid and high end rpm. Installation was easy on the right header, on the left I had to remove the master cylinder and starter. This was installed on a 1996 dodge ram 1500 5.2 liter 2wd. Just have a competent muffler shop finish up the exhaust and you set.
B002PQU6MY|4|The fit and finish of these lights was perfect, but the actual width of the light beam itself seemed to me to be a bit narrower than the factory light's beam. For the price, you won't find a better PAIR of fog lights for this vehicle!
B004LWVEKS|5|This is the best battery charger I've ever used.
B0001CMUV4|5|Stops the annoying rattle immediately.
B0002NIH82|2|Actual size (from packaging) is 25.75 X 9.5 inch.  I checked the package and the product number is 4302, just like in the amazon description.  Actually, a good deal versus the size in the amazon description.  However, I can't use because i have the sliding rear window.
B00594OIWS|4|The MB Chrome tire stems valves blends in well with the black carbon caps. It's gives my vehicle a sense of uniformity yet distiguishing my vehile personalization. Very classy.
B005NBZK9W|5|I had this for almost 2 years before it started to rust around the mounting holes and that's only because the screws rusted and it spread to the cover! I will be buying another one because it looks great!
B008HAUQNG|5|Blablabla
B002PUY3HE|1|Gift for my sister, huge fan.  She was disappointed with the quality of logo
B0067UDZWW|5|It is working well.<br />I should see how long it will last but it cleans much better than $20 expensive blade that I've had.
B00CFSZVFO|5|this was soooo easy to install!
B00C59645O|1|Apparently not good in Florida sun. Grey coating became a powder that came off the cover leaving huge white splotches and powder everywhere.  The Company was great to work with though, I sent them pics of what was happening and refunded my money immediately! Great company but can't recommend this particular product.
B00JAOAVU6|5|Looks great on the truck
B00NUA30SG|5|worked great
B003RQBKLC|5|Works as intended.  I use it to simultaneously power my gps and dashcam.
B003WOWBIK|5|Great
B002NAMJHC|5|These were very nice. They were easy to put on. And they look great on the car.
B008D7D8V0|5|I have 5 sticker son my car and there is a noticeable difference in speed.....also I wasn't too keen on having the green and yellow because my car is silver but upon close inspection i found that once you install the sticker you can carefully remove the green and/or yellow parts if you want leaving you with the silvery white background color
B000C2Q1OU|5|good selection of seals, non vehicle make specific. Will fit any vehicle system.
B008K7ZIFW|5|great price, fast delivery, works great
B0064D37G6|5|For some reason I thought it would fit on inside of window to protect it from weather. Oh well, cheap enough to last a while and then replace if necessary.  Good instructions on how to apply. Arrived quickly, packaged well. Would buy more.
B004IARK4C|1|Absolutely horrible, you can see about 2 feet in front of you after installed. Worst headlight bulbs I've ever seen.
B002R0YMXC|1|The &#34;passenger side&#34; and &#34;driver&#34; side do not match the same year of vehicle! One works for 2000-01 camry, the other works for 97-99 camry. Watch out
B004CMMFK0|5|This spray is amazing! It really does smell like a stripper..its wild..I love it . It arrived yesterday , I sprayed full strength to test it out and this morning I can still smell it all over my house...im buying more this week..very good buy
B005CQT6VQ|5|Son LOVES it, and uses it every day.
B00CMY26UY|1|I bought this as part of a birthday gift for someone who just got a Corvette. It completely fell apart the first time he tried to separate the 2 rings.  It was very embarrassing.  I must say, though, the return and refund was very easy.
B001AWLTX4|5|nice
B00317BCZQ|5|Amazing results in performance, includes everything needed to tune the bike properly. My bike went from good to great. Buy it!
B00AAJA87Q|2|I was excited to get these bulbs to replace the only other bulbs on my truck that weren't LED's. Well, super dissapointment when I popped them in. They are about half as bright as the 5watt regular bulbs that they were going to replace.<br /><br />Pros: Probably have a super low current draw...<br /><br />Cons: Only about half as bright as a standard bulb. Don't fit in the socket very tight, I was afraid of them falling out while driving down the road.<br /><br />Overall pretty dissapointed. Probably gonna return them, even though they were only $7, just because I am not going to use them for anything else!
B0006H938M|5|I had an aqua magic IV toilet in my Trek for 14 years before it finally gave up the ghost. I bought this and it took about 15 minutes to install it. It's a perfect fit replacement for the IV. The only exception for me was that, because the toilet is taller, my water line had to  be extended about an inch and a half. With sharkbite fittings that took no time at all.<br /><br />The rest of the installation is simple. It fits right on the old metal base plate to your sewer drain. Just throw the old gasket away and put the new one onto the toilet drain. Then line up the bolts and work the toilet down over the base plate. As you tighten the bolts you can feel the gasket compress. Once tight, put on the supplied bolt covers, hook up the water and your done.<br /><br />Other than being taller than the IV, the other dimensions seem to be identical. I have folding cabinet doors that had very close clearance on the back corners of my old toilet, and the clearance was fine once I installed the new toilet. The water flow into the toilet is much better on the new one. Hopefully this one will last another 14 years.
B008U1MOM8|4|Only works on android system. Will not work on iphone.
B004BWU8H8|5|Works as advertised.  The fit and finish is great.  Was super easy to put in the truck.  Will work well&#62;
B0013RGQW0|5|These fit my 2004 Unlimited perfect. No cutting or fitting necessary. Covered my 33's
B00GWVCZUO|5|Seems to work fine. No more squealing bearings. Product appears well made.
B000GU24J4|2|I did not like the cover did not hold up to Michigan wind ripped holes in cover the cold did not help.
B002M3KSK0|5|Roof rack worked perfectly for my Cadillac SRX. Installed very easy and had no issue's with the gear on my roof. I would recommend this product.
B003FBV8ZW|5|My husband loves them.  Great for the price
B00BLAFZP8|5|Brighter than I expected, have mine through 20% tinted glass and works awesome!! Had to extend wires but have it hard wired to my switch box!! Perfect!!
B004A2YTGK|5|Worked on my Keystone Laredo 35 foot camper. Not sure of the size of this I just know it worked perfect.
B002TMQXN0|4|Have not installed it yet.  I'm putting this in a motor home and it is currently in storage, so I will install it in another month.
B005P7CJH0|5|Awsome
B00FTNMLIM|5|Timely and fully met needs
B0050HC1J6|5|Can beat the price ...great bars
B000C5HJP2|5|Fit perfect...secure...
B00ANQ6P1E|5|Not that hard to install, works just like they say it will. Shipping was a breeze, haven't had an issue out of it yet
B002JH7PEQ|3|it says 200w but your car has to have the right component otherwise it beeps all day and doesnt charge.
B00COE3Z8E|2|I followed the fit guide provided by Amazon and purchased what they listed would fit my 2013 Toyota RAV4. The 12&#34; wiper attached just fine but the length was much too long and got stuck at the top of the window under the spoiler section. I had to forced it off and ended up breaking the wiper.
B003179IPC|5|these spring are better than stock yet not too hard on ur hand or clutch cable
B00DQUU268|5|Fast shipping...Great product fits perfect can't wait to give them a try.  Will update review once I have used them.
B00PKLSGKU|5|worked fine and saved money
B0037R8GA4|4|Love the pads, they're very quiet and stopping is very quiet.
B007Y8A3P8|5|Foud out tha i could have done the job for way less than buying this but that being said this kit was exactly wat i needed to get my truck back on the road fast. 5 star for sure.
B007UTPUDQ|5|Well built and fast shipping. Doesn't adjust up and down as easily as I'd hoped but maybe it will loosen up in time. I use it high to get my boat out of a raised garage with a ramp where sometimes the trailer drags, once I get it out I lower the hitch and with the weight of the boat on the trailer wheel it wont budge. So I have to take the trailer off the ball to lower it. It might not have solved my issue but it is quiet and strong going down the road.
B001HJA4Q8|5|Fits as it should - direct replacement - installed without problem.
B004P23VNW|5|Great top.<br />Put it on myself in about 30 minutes<br /><br />One tip.  Put it on, but do not try to zip all the zippers fully for a few hours to let the fabric stretch out a bit.
B00BGJI0D8|5|Love the looks of this decal. It's super easy to apply, the colors are very vibrant and eye catching. I need another 19 for all of my dogs' feet!
B000BZJQNQ|5|This is my first experience with a cabin filter and what a difference it makes.  After a year of filtering, they are worth the money to replace even if it is difficult to get in and out(95 BMW 3 series).
B0049ELS54|5|Great part.  We had a engine light come on intermittingly...we heard this might solve the issue...it did.  Good quality.  Great price.
B000BUU5XQ|5|Great
B00ENJHMLY|3|could have had a much better fit. NOT worth the money I paid for it
B001DYUFJS|5|Love my mats very sturdy
B00CO1UTYU|5|for the money a quality made case, nice looking and very functional
B001GN29LI|5|T-Connector 55124Electrical System Type Designators (ESTD) 3W Install Time 10 minutes Location S1Wiring Harness Location Guide. Absolutely flawless installation.  Would recommend this product to anyone, even with little or no mechanical experience.
B004Y760NQ|5|The description on Amazon is wrong.  Alloy USA part number 21129 fits the LEFT rear side on a WJ with Dana 44A rear axle and VariLok hydraulic &#34;locker&#34; option.  Mine is a 2001 model and this axle fit like a glove.  Part number 21128 fits the RIGHT rear on the Dana 44A with VariLok option.  These axles appeared to be high quality parts.  They are bare axles...so you'll need to remove the ABS tone ring from your old shafts and press them onto these.  Also, you'll need a new oil seal and bearing/press ring set for each side and also new lug studs for each side, since these axles ship as bare units.  But I love them...the chromoly is said to be 35% stronger than stock so HOPEFULLY no more bent Jeep axles!
B000BWCG6S|4|This is a very good set of Gaskets for my small block.<br />Except for the loss of time in reciving them everything turned out just fine<br />everything seams to be in the set,I'll find out on how good when I start putting the engine back together
B00G23NN0S|5|Awesome
B005EKY1EM|5|just leave it hooked up and let it do its thing.... so far it has taken two battery's that would not hold charge and turned them back into holding 12.7+ dc volts with a whole bunch of life.  could not be happier.
B004YTOJ78|5|Love these also best mounting for motorcycle crash bars for extra lighting.
B000NJU620|2|Buckle broke after my third ride for no reason.  It's cheaply made so the buckle serves no purpose.  Solely decorative.  I don't think these boots will really give ankle protection.  But hey, I tried to go cheap and ... I succeeded.
B004ZVRGXO|1|2009 Ford Edge Sport - Doesn't fit.  Too Loose<br /><br />Don't even bother with this order as they don't provide any customer service.
B00829HBEE|5|Bought this one for my 4Runner, and it works great. Good factory clutch.
B0023SWPAA|5|I saved 100 bucks by making this purchase on Amazon....I also bought another car part this year and saved 100 bucks. It seems the mark up in this stuff must be huge...The part.. Well it works great. I have not had it on the truck long so I have no idea how it's gonna hold up.. It is the same part sold in Auto Supply stored locally for 149 dollars plus taxes..I am VERY pleased especially because the mechanic installed the part and made it work great for only 100 dollars. The end result was the same as if I bought the part locally and Amazon paid my mechanic. I am happy..Check Amazon for other expensive parts like Fuel Filler Assemblies. Locally they can be 300 dollars or more..Amazon saved me over 100 bucks on that..
B003KP47TM|5|Chain fit fine, easy to install using the master link and clip, quiet. Bought to replace original chain on my BMW F650GS Dakar.
B003CG9QFY|5|Easy to install, and gives the tailgate a nice, finished look. Includes two molle bags, which are easy to mount. I probably would have preferred two of the larger bags (the one on the right in the picture) rather than one large and one small, since the small bag only takes up about half the height of the panel, but I'm having a hard time finding a bag or pouch set that would fit in the leftover space effectively. But that's a small complaint -- you're free to mix and match. So far, it seems fairly well constructed and durable.
B00K0OFSUS|3|I'm a little disappointed in the hole alignment.  There is a tab that wraps under the frame.  When this tab is bolted to the bottom of the frame it forces the horizontal mounting slots high to the point you can't fit a bolt through.  I had to stack washers and shift the slot over with an end mill to get proper alignment.<br /><br />Would I buy it knowing what I know now? Yes.  Its a pretty good looking bumper and used it to pull about a ton of compost in a beefy trailer without any issues.
B00KJ17RLK|5|Very nice light for the price, really bright and looks to be well built.
B000C9S2J0|5|Fit perfectly. A few years back I bought another cap. I can't remember the reason for the previous purchase but the cap fit tight and it was difficult adding oil, if needed. The cap arrived in a timely manner and was at an affordable price and free delivery with Prime.
B0046990U2|4|Perfect fit.
B0006IX7V0|4|This doesn't fit our Lance trailer properly but, I will buy velcro and make the strap longer and it should work. The awning arms on our trailer are the &#34;ladder&#34; like ones rather than straight with the awning.
B00J1TK0WE|4|Nice part
B00FB5W7ZA|4|Looks great, had to work with it a little bit to get it to fit
B0041S1OUM|5|Great food grade grease.. Mike
B000UCWGI2|1|The air freshener looked good but smelled AWFUL! I should've thought twice when I saw that they didn't specify a scent besides \\"fresh\\". It smelled like rotting, bitter oil. I thought about re-scenting it but instead decided to return in. My tip: DON'T GET IT! Unless you want your car to smell disgusting.
B00M4KTI4I|5|Great range with these. Programming was so simple.
B006RUJ2D8|5|Great Stuff i recommend this product.
B002ZTNWTU|5|I don't know how this American made product manages to compete as well as it does with cheap floor mats. But if you're like me, once you've bought WeatherTEch, it's awfully hard to go back to the cheaper options. This is my fourth set for different cars. They do fit perfectly and the high side lips keeps spilled drinks, snow/slush and rain-wet shoes from spoiling your interior. (Isn't it a bit ironic that years ago we paid extra to have carpet in the floor of your car instead of rubber mats, and now we pay to put rubber mats over the carpet?)
B000C9FZM2|3|It wasn't machined well. I had to have it turned to get a slight pulse out of the brake pedal. Still glad that I went with it over the standard drum. It's certainly heavier duty.
B00ANZHG7C|5|This seemed like a good idea when purchasing them. The problem is when buying it appears to be a good thing to have many of the rags available but soon learned that with anything if you don't ration them out they lose the value and do not become appreciated. They start to be used as a throw away item.
B0007M1ZGE|2|Fit wasn't great.  Had to make bumper adjustments to make it fit.
B001N0D60C|3|does not come with the closing clasp shown in the picture
B00KMYRPM0|5|I plugged this inverter into a 20A 12v power outlet in my truck and plugged in my slim PS3 and was in business. It works perfectly so far; I would definitely recommend this inverter.
B000BRFTH6|5|This is plugged in and visible as you enter the door of our RV.  It shows the voltage and polarity of the campsite power.  Allows you to be sure polarity is correct using the indicator lights, before you power up appliances.  Also during heavy loads, you can monitor voltage.  You don't want to damage the air conditioner compressor on the AC unit or electronics in your microwave with reverse polarity, open ground & undervoltage issues (less than 100-105 volts).
B009OTW646|4|The snow foam car wash works fairly well, loosening most of the dirt.  However, it doesn't seem to quite &#34;loosen&#34; it all when the car is really filthy.  It is also very thick when trying to pour into the sprayer container.
B00F9UAV2S|5|I have a medium hat sized head, and knowing that this was a junior sized helmet, I went with the large.  The size fits great, however it was a little narrow around the cheekbones for me.  I fixed this quite easily by placing a wood block in the front to stretch it out and put it in the oven (on lowest heat, for a very short amount of time).  Left the wood block in it for a week and it fits absolutely perfect now.
B00FC22RV6|5|awesome product fitment was a wee bit to small but find a rubber ring or a flat washer and it'll work and i got this for my 1994 gmc sierra. these i got for my high beams and there super bright and looks amazing.
B00A82DOXA|5|Great replacement battery.
B007KPTC2U|5|instructions were provided, but were not really necessary as the unit was simple in it's design and self explanatory.  Would purchase again, except sooner.
B0034CZ4UM|5|Looks nice. Fits well.
B0057HAAII|4|Battery is exactly as advertised, and a steal for an AGM battery. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is I had to slightly enlarge the holes on my bike's cable contacts to fit the bolts that came with the battery.
B00FEXC4RA|3|It bolts up to factory bumper screew holes but its a hard metarial and the wind busted mine first time i rode down interstate 65mph
B008FYXTF6|5|Love it no one has one like me
B000H6P55W|5|I reviewed and researched carriers for 3 days before I chose this one.  I got it in 3 days and familiarized myself with it before the trip.  I was impressed that it was a thick durable carrier.  We packed it with 4 suitcases and some bags just to fill it up.  It stayed completley tight the entire trip with no noises at all.  I really like the fact that it folds up to be stored so it doesnt take much space.  We drove a total of 1900 miles to Florida and back to Indiana and had no problems whatsoever.  I highly recommend it.  FOR THE MONEY, YOU CANT BEAT IT!!!!
B00HHGPIHU|5|Love them
B004SWWUHC|4|Exactly what I ordered, easy to wire up and place. The screws are hard to use, better to just use 3M double sided tape to stick them where you want them.
B007ETLKG8|4|Driving a diesel and having an external tank can get expensive if youre not careful when you fill up, but with the confidence I have in Pri-D I can leave the diesel in the tank and just re-treat as necessary. Also, the 6.0l Ford injectors really like the lubricity it adds, keeping mpgs up and stiction down.
B0009JKGFG|5|This wax was easy to apply and it took me 1 hour to wax a 2001 Toyoto Camry.<br /><br />I cannot understand why it is not carried in the auto supply stores, i.e.,Pep Boys
B003S6F3IC|5|Part works perfectly.  Arrived very fast and in good packaging. Would buy more parts from this company and more Dorman parts.
B000GU5IEW|4|First cover I've owned and it does what it says.  The stuff bag it comes with is convenient.  So far it's been rained and snowed on and the bike doesn't receive any of the moisture. It's a tight fit with a sissy bar and windshield but that's the way it supposed to work.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that the fabric is thinner than I thought it would be, and I wonder how long it will last, but time will tell.
B009UHO492|5|The girl that does my nails has a WHITE HARLEY switch back.She loved it.
B00801RR5M|5|You cannot beat the price of this pair of complete strut assemblies! They fit my 2002 Sunfire perfectly and though they're no Monroe Sensa-Tracs, I got all four for the price of ONE Econo-strut at Autozone, NAPA or O'Reilly Auto Parts
B001CF1A7O|5|this is shorter than most of the same thing out there.  solid stock for the receiver part.  very durable and stron
B003SYP23A|2|Compared to the original Ford headlamps on the car they are definitely a lesser quality.  The lens is clear as is should how ever the light pattern is not the same as the Ford headlamp. It does not project a clean beam. The beam is all over the place for lack of better words and does not shine the light were needed. Pay alittle bit more and go for the Ford lights or a higher quality aftermarket.
B00B2ABE0M|5|installation was fairly simple. this took my friend and I about 10 hours to complete. my truck looks great!
B0002UEN1U|4|works
B00BNX81CC|1|Piece was too large could not fasten clips so had to end up purchasing filter from dealer which now paid for two with this one just being a lost
B00390X6DQ|4|Good product, gives the jeep a nice look. Reason for 4 stars is because it should be $20 or less. Not sure if has any power increase to the vents but overall a good purchase.
B000FQ07HU|5|No issues.  Fit perfect.
B000GBIPWS|5|I would highly recommend spending a bit more for the StrongArm products over a generic trunk lift. Yes, you can find a less expensive trunk lift, but in my experience you will have to replace the generic lift sooner. In comparing the StrongArm to a generic lift, it is quite noticeable that the StrongArm is just a better made product.
B004AQU8X4|2|it came as advertised and is satisfactory.
B007Y5LA9Y|5|Worked on my 1995 Pathfinder with an after-market lift kit.
B0012ILZAS|5|Looks good,well built,really really loud. Only thing wrong I had to use longer mounting bolts. I used hexhead ss bolts,easer to install and tighten up.
B00KTJ4IWS|1|This was not what I expected! I wanted the dashboard AC control console of a 2001 Highlander, not an integrated circuit. Please put the picture of the product here to guide customers. I just wasted money!
B008G28KGK|5|An easy upgrade to take years of age off my 2001 Honda Accord.<br /><br />Installation only took about 20 minutes with basic tools. My car looks 10 years newer thanks to this small upgrade. It easily increases the car's value by a couple hundred dollars.
B008A169XI|1|This product ripped quickly and is not in any way water repellent. First time it rained I had water in. Then it froze to the camper and left large icicles hanging from the camper underneath the cover. This completely prevented me from removing it. It has several tears around the clasps that hold it together as well as on the roof. Cover is rather large however it does not live up to it reputation and was clearly cheap for a reason.
B001UKQZL2|5|Direct bolt on for 2000 celica gt
B0007VANJ0|5|Ordered this product used and it looked brand new! Took ten minutes to install. The product is well made, and there is no cutting the bumper. 5000 pound tow is more than I'll ever need for this auto. Looks great on my 2007 Grand Cherokee!
B004323RQK|3|I am not impressed with this product.  This is very light duty compared to others that I have purchased in the past
B001PL7ZA6|5|Although I would rather spend the money on something more fun, a shade for our new pickup was a necessity. We have had those cheap shades. They were a waste of good money since they lasted no time at all and were not custom for our vehicle. If you need shades, do yourself a favor and get good ones in the first place. It will save you in the long run. I personally like this shade. It looks well constructed and of good material. It is amazing how much it cuts the heat in the car. I know it also saves tremendously on sun rot.
B0018KWVVW|5|Cover is large enough to fit to the ground on our Porlaris sportman with room to spare.  Good quality. an Excellent buy.
B000N9VF6Q|5|Make sure you pressurize it to the correct pressure.
B001A0OJJW|5|thanks it is what i wanted and it looks good am looking forward to do more business with you thanks again
B002UC6NFM|5|worked like a light bulb should.
B0015PK3AG|5|My neighbor (a mechanic) told me about this took when I told him I was going to try my hand at my first oil change on a new Toyota.  He said the ones they sell at the local auto parts stores are junk.  I hate nothing more then JUNK tools.  I bought this, and so far so good.  My only question is.... WHY THE HECK did we get away from canister oil filters?  IT WAS TOO EASY?  JERKS!
B000BN3A4Y|5|Haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it would do the job in a fix.
B0002T8Y5M|1|This product was never received. The company will not reply to my questions concerning this item. To date, no refund has been received or offered. Be careful with these Vendors !
B00FH8P1DG|5|Great light turns night into day
B000CO7E6W|1|this is one grade &#34;A&#34;  colossal piece of crap. replaced my rear window latch in my '93 Ford F150, and it broke within 24 hours. used it five times total. four times to test it, the 5th time I was actually in a situation where I wanted my window open, and SNAP! Broken piece of junk. I would return it but the sale price was so cheap it would cost me more money than its worth to return it. BUYER BEWARE!!! OR BUYER LOOK ELSEWHERE, MORE LIKE.
B004KL0I9I|5|Works as advertised with the softwares I've used-- OBD Droid Scan and Torque Pro for Android. No problems whatsoever.  Also worked with a few Palm Pilot programs but I can't remember which ones I used.
B003ZJ1156|4|Its a good quality product but I was expecting an exact fit in my Rav4 like the pictures.  Didn't know what to rate it so I gave it a four stars because its good quality and it fits, but the fitting was not as good as I wanted. I have a 2007 Rav4 Limited Edition V6.
B008HRZMHY|4|I installed it on my car.. Wish it was smaller to fit in where the dodge symbol used to be. But it's great and gets a lot of attention from pedestrians!
B000NE7TJ8|4|I ordered 3 pks they arrived the same day as the fastener remover  which was a bonus as they were shipped separately.  haven't  used them yet but they look just like the ones will will be replacing. and from other reviews i'm sure they will work just fine.  thanks
B0016VGUGU|5|nice and heavy duty.
B001DXCUWY|5|This goes great with my other one. Now I have two handles for both pans on the burner. Made cooking all the better. just be careful that the handle doesn't get too hot.
B0068BA8B6|5|Long story short, I purchased a Scorpion EXO-900 helmet online in a XL size but it was too snug for my personal comfort so luckily, Scorpion makes these replacement liners that will replace your worn out liners or in my case allow you to change sizes. So now, my helmet is a XXL and fits perfect.
B003176GCU|5|Excellent product. Bike rides like a dreeam. I would certainly reccomand these shocks to all my friends when looking for replacement shock absorbers.
B003VPG7CQ|5|I bought this a while ago as a replacement for a 98 lumina. It was easy to program myself and worked perfectly for a over a year until I sold the car. great buy.
B005FRGKDO|5|These are of a GREAT quality and I could not be happier!!!<br />Covers fit like a glove. Easy to install and look nice.
B008FYKOX6|1|Streaks and chirps after only a couple of weeks in my 2010 Nissan Xterra<br /><br />Old standard wipers would do fine, but these make all the noise along with freezing up when the old ones would not.
B00WFEG7P6|5|I installed this horn on my Suzuki DR650 and it is way better then the stock horn, I am very happy with this horn so far it fits in the area where the stock horn was, all I had to do is drill out the hole just a little. Hooking it up was no problem and it works off the stock wires with no relay needed.
B007ZXXHMI|4|Good Quality, njot to hard to install
B003LFQ7W6|5|The f1 is a great hard top cover that's a breeze to install and worth the money.  It took me about 20 minutes after watching the you tube video.  The cover can be installed by one person easily.  Make sure to get the clamps on tight when installing the rails, probably the most important piece of the actual install.
B000XBNYYK|5|As described. However, I thought you could pick each sound instead of having to here all three in sequence.
B000WJX29U|1|Wrong  battery.  Didn't fit the scooter it advertised (Genuine Buddy 170)  but had put in the fluids, charged it and threw out the box so it was too late to return.
B00ADPHD02|5|Awesome for diesel engines
B00ES5Q7KA|5|Works great on 2008 honda odyssey looks exactly like the original and wipes great. I don't<br />know what else there is to say about a window wiper.
B0027W7R00|5|very nice
B00LX28WAO|5|I had to do some modifications to the existing housing on my 1995 Kawasaki Bayou KLF300C as they were a little taller with the mounting brackets than I had anticipated, but, well worth it. The added illumination and reduced power consumption are a welcome addition.<br /><br />They shipped and were receive quickly and I am VERY pleased.
B0001MQ7BI|2|it was to small to move air
B00QMWQK2M|5|Great price and great product.
B00MFF8BZY|1|They don't fit the 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailblazer either. Complete waste of time and money.
B00AJV42KO|5|It's a seal what can go wrong. Fast delivery and correct number
B0013G0348|3|Ordered up an AC Delco EP-11 6V Fuel Pump; Got a box marked same; inside was an Airtex E8011 fuel pump instead.  Looks like it would work but......what's the deal here.
B00144B32A|5|This stuff is great.. First let me tell you the Marine version is just a marketing ploy.. Same Stuff.  I have used this on my boat, fiberglass pool, car, and bathroom tile... this stuff works great, and leaves no residue. I Highly recommend this product.
B000RXKR6M|5|Use this for the lower half of my car where most of the street grime collects. Works very well and seems to be holding up well.
B004C6OBBC|5|Works as advertised.
B000CIV6HQ|4|The system went on easy but the clamps that came with the system for the tips were to big and I broke one trying to tighten it. I had to go to Advance Auto Parts to get the right clamps. Other than the clamps I am happy with the system.
B001S1IN72|1|The return process was way to much of a hassle so i didn't even bother. I bought these figuring they were T10 bulbs. turns out they were not properly labeled. Use caution while buying these.
B0029XK48O|5|Love this kit. If you need one of these to get in a tight spot, you can't do without. Regular sockets are too tall. Money well spent.
B008AGTCVY|5|My stock clutch on my baja doodle bug went out after several years of usage.  I purchased this to replace it and I am very happy with the clutch.  It does not have the set pin that the stock clutch has but it has a keyway which locks the clutch in without issues.  This is not a limitation and the clutch works fine as-is.
B000EDSSDY|5|The level is larger than I expected and for me this is good.  I use the level for turntable leveling and it has worked nicely.
B000VUASMY|4|Not a perfect fit but close enough.  Nice thick rubber.  Corners and edges don't sit flat in my pickup bed but close enough for me.  If it fit perfect, I would have gave 5 stars.  In a 2002 Dodge Ram quad cab.
B00EYC1VA8|4|Just tried the first one.The small one works well for tying up my earphone cord. Hope to use more of  them
B00GKRQ7DG|5|I ordered this on 9/23/14 and I received it on 9/25/14, and I was honestly surprised because of how fast I had gotten it. Not only was the early time it took to get this great, but the sticker looks great also. I didn't realize that I could have gotten it in any size that I wanted, but the default size that it came in was perfect to me. Also, it came with 2, when I only expected one. So, all in all this is a great purchase and I would recommend it, it sticks well, and it's good quality.<br /><br />I also have matching stickers on my car and phone now :)
B008AEMLLY|3|Follow the instructions and you will do okay.  Pay attention to the slight roll in the mesh, as it is there for a reason. Also, the bottom free floats (the top is what is clipped on) so I used some wire connected to the back of the license plate holder to keep it in place.  This worked out.
B003JN9T84|5|works great!
B00651BGTC|5|Extremely happy with the way this antenna looks on my 2006 Silverado... very classy yet subtle, not gaudy. My package didn't come with the right adapter but after a quick email to AntennaX, the right part was sent out to me the very next day.

B002KD0H9E|5|I've got two of these bad boys on my S10, They're very low to the ground, I've hit them pretty hard on some stupid steep curbs, nothing's broken! Very durable. Added some extra clamps on the side to prevent any threat!  I had 55w bulbs in, but recently put in 100w's. They are extremely nice. I recommend buying them
B001C6JCM8|2|Bought this item in Nov 2011.  Spent quite a bit of time researching to be sure it would fit my 2004 Jetta TDI.  Information in the ad at the time of purchase stated it was a direct replacement.  When I went to install it found out it wasn't a direct replacement.  I have noticed since then that the item description excludes TDI's.  Would have been nice to know that ahead of time.
B001FVEEDC|5|I'm new to this hitch but not new to towing. I have been towing a boat and a cart for a lot of years. I downsized into a Nissan Versa Hatchback 2009. Love the car it just doesn't have enough capacity to two a 2700 pound boat. It does however handle the small trailer for moving lightweight construction materials and appliance purchases etc. I looked into eTrailer and their hitches were lighter weight for the same hitch so I figured this one was built with thicker steel or more of it. Anyhow it is impressive to look at right out of the box. (That is if it survives UPS. Do you know what UPS stands for... Unbelievably Pulverized Packages and this one is no exception. Fortunately the piece is heavy duty enough to withstand UPS) Anyhow the point I really wanted to get to was that in order to install this on my Versa I had to elongate a hole in the bottom of the side member. (What most people call a frame) Trying to do that with a grinding bit is useless. You are fighting High Strength Steel. And here is the golden tip, you need a Carbide Serrated bit that can shape or mold steel without losing its sharpness. I wasted a lot of time today figuring all of this out. Went to Home Depot, Ace Hardware, and finally found the ultimate solution here at Amazon, although it is a whole kit of bits instead of just one which is all you need. Here it is [[ASIN:B00061SFKK Astro Pneumatic 2181 Double Cut Carbide Rotary Burr Set with 1/4-Inch Shank]] You can buy an individual bit but the one that was shown showed a picture of a 1/4\\" bit with a larger head but what was received by another reviewer was a 1/4\\" shaft bit with the same sized head. I needed to make a one inch hole and didn't want to do it with a tiny bit. This complete set also has all of the different bits so you can do a precise surgical job of it.<br /><br />For those who don't care you can use a rotary grinder, making big wide rough troughs, and destroy the resale value of your vehicle. With the right tool and making a clean round hole that is only 1 1/8\\" diameter you can do a nice job of installing the hitch, and keep the all factory look to your car. Even a mechanic wouldn't know that you worked on it. With a tiny bit of undercoating, the whole receiver can then be removed without most people being aware of it. By the way if you place a hitch on your Nissan Versa for any reason it voids the warranty. My warranty is running out in July so I am getting a head start on being able to fully use the car again; I miss my trailer. The Versa has the CVT Trans with a belt instead of gears which is great for pickup and fuel economy, but for towing steel gears rules. So go light with CVT Tran's, no heavy loads.<br /><br />So people truly understand the installation what they have you do is make a slightly bigger hole on the bottom of the frame than the one that is already there. So you are elongating it. Through that hole you thread a wire, actually two wires one for each bolt and washer set on that side, and it takes the bolt and long flat strap/washer and sends them back out the mounting hole so you can catch them with the hitch and tighten the nut. It's an ingenious method for installation. So anyhow do a nice clean job of elongating the hole; I'm making mine nice and round so you can't tell, and then when you are finished the job you want to seal the holes bare edges so they don't rust. At the very least a little spot of undercoat will do, or even better yet a tender primer job on the metal, and or touch up paint, and then a light brushing of undercoat making sure you get inside the hole as well.<br /><br />All in all this is a very nice hitch and should last for many years to come. Highly recommended.round hole that is only 1 1/8\\" diameter you can do a nice job of installing the hitch, and keep the all factory look to your car.

B006AZCIVI|5|I am happy I was able to find the Mobil M1-111 oil filters at amazon. This filter has been discontinued and I use this # in my 1978 Corvette. Mobil 1 products are the best insurance for my car! You can't touch this filter for $6.50 ea. in any stores!!!
B00ELS0YZS|5|Delivery was on time, installation instructions were easy to follow, looks great!  I bought the headlight and fog light rings and wired to the parking lights to avoid installing a switch. 2009 wrangler jk
B00WQOCKME|5|I have never bought/owned any Ford branded tools and was genuinely impressed when I received these 5 tools. The 8&#34; Universal pliers, 6&#34; Diagonal Cutter pliers and 6&#34; Long Nose pliers, 10&#34; Locking pliers and 8&#34; Adjustable wrench--all made of carbon steel are of the same quality of the Craftsman and Kobalt hand tools I own. The blue and black ergonomic rubber coated handles of the pliers make them easier to grip and more effective to utilize. The black powder-coat on the handle surface of the 8&#34; Adjustable wrench make for an excellent grip and the jaws with clean sharp edges and powerful mechanism lock on to bolts and nuts. The !0&#34; Locking pliers grip firmly yet release quickly--as good as any other big name &#34;Grip&#34; pliers.
B007AONLZK|5|Works just as good as my original liftgate supports. Installed exactly like the original equipment.
B0040UN5QC|4|great for use with our Go karts that we recently purchased.  fits nice, keeps the dirt out of your eyes.
B004D92S9K|5|I rather think the sticker fist well on my car... and old, sort of beat Mustang. I am very happy with the sticker!
B001CL08JE|5|I ordered this for my daughter, for her new truck, she loves cow stuff, and it was ALOT better than I expected. very good quality seat covers, seatbelt covers, and steering wheel cover! thank you! she loved them                                                   Linda
B000MG40S0|5|The look great and work great. I put them on a westin bar and the look hot.<br />Love the brand PIAA.
B007TWOK4Y|5|Perfect fit, nice truck like ride on my sons 04 Grand Cherokee Laredo, with all four new spring isolators could  have probably stuffed 32&#34; duratrack tires under it with no wheel spacers needed, but opted for 31&#34; duratracks with no wheel spacers necessary he was scared to do any cutting or trimming. crawled it up on an 18&#34; tree stump to test and it flexed out nicely with zero rubbing. Thanks Fat Bob!!! P.S. if you want this install to give good drivable results, don't be cheep, replace all 4 tie rod ends, and all 8 spring isolators while you have everything apart before you get an alignment, everyone talking about drive ability and new squeaks and bang can almost always associate their problems to these items being worn out. This will make your old grandma car ride like a new truck, stiff not like a luxury sudan. Have fun and wheel it!
B00IEKEW6Q|5|Works great
B001LHVOVK|5|does what needed to be done. had codes on my car , plug this in and got the codes fixed and it can erase them too
B004NJUWP2|5|I have a Jeep Liberty 2005. The black bumpers have been gray for a long time. Used this product along with the PRE-WOW and all but the top of the rear bumper stayed black for three month's. Repeated the application on the rear bumper after about 30 days and it is still looking good a two months. Getting ready to repeat the application. I can handle doing it every three months to have a vehicle with black bumpers that look black and new. Beats the cost of a new jeep.
B004SX5HM6|1|Just not pleased with these lights. Would not buy.
B007AHH7FM|3|I have to say I really love my new passing lamps (and headlamp, too!)!  The light is very clear and crisp for being LEDs.  Installation was as simple as changing a light bulb.  Fitment is great (except that they do stick out a little more than the stock lens).<br /><br />So, why the bad rating?  The price!!!  I didn't realize that Kuryakyn puts a cardboard cover over the box to make it look like these are their lights.  They are made by Truck Lite and retail for significantly less than the Kuryakyn re-badged product.  And THAT ticks me off.  If you contact the seller (not Kuryakyn), you may be able to get the Truck Lite without the cardboard cover and save some dough.  I didn't find this out until I got the box or I would have definitely called around to find Truck Lites!
B00L3W737C|2|Alot of waves in the plastic should have bought the rexspeed ones
B000E8X53M|5|No complaints. I can't notice any difference from when my stock struts were still in good shape. Plus, they were dirt cheap compared to KYB and even Monroe.
B00CMY2QCW|3|What I expected, could of been better quality
B000G28PQ8|5|only one to use if you want it done right
B000Q46B58|1|Don't look at the ad's picture because you would love it. At first time I met it, I think it's a wrong item which I ordered. After I checked it, Oh!!..is it a mattress?. It composes of 2 pieces of foam, one junky pillow, and one bed sheet. It's not worthy of purchasing it even $199.
B006DYDD8I|4|Lexus parking brake shoe set are well made and fit just fine. I also replaced the mounting springs and hardware (NOT INCLUDED)
B0009LPJ6U|2|I'm a heavy smoker and bought an ivory-colored pebbled leather purse just under a year ago. I hang it over the chair in the kitchen where I smoke, take it with me in the car when I drive, so obviously it 'yellows' pretty quickly with cigarette tar. I bought a case of this stuff at the same time, figuring I could keep it clean, but I encountered a number of problems with this cleaner.<br /><br />For one thing, the instructions tell you to spray it onto a clean cloth, working it into a low lather. Maybe it would have worked differently had I not been working with 'pebbled' leather, but I had a hell of a time getting it to lather anywhere. It seemed to absorb right into the pebbled leather before it had any hope of lathering, either that, or it simply evaporated on me instantly. Even the second time around, when the leather was pretty saturated with the cleaner from the first round, it still wouldn't lather up for me no matter how much I sprayed on the cloth. I even tried spraying it directly onto the purse - still nothing. It seemed to have the consistency of Windex, and I guess I was expecting the cleaner to have a more 'oily' texture to it - after all, this is leather I'm cleaning, not windows.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed in the end result. This cleaner didn't even budge black marks on the bottom of the purse. And though it seemed to remove some of the yellowing, a good bit of it still remains, especially on the purse straps. I question whether it actually removed ANY of the yellowing because the cloth I was using wasn't even slightly discolored. It almost seems as if the yellowing just absorbed deeper into the grain of the leather and never was removed.<br /><br />Bottom line, I will probably look into an alternative next time around. Perhaps Murphey's Oil Soap. Regular cleaners never touch the tar on my kitchen walls, but Murphey's Oil melts it away on contact.
B00CHE7JX8|4|These put out a great deal of light but its not bright bright as claimed, claims to be 800 lumens about a 60 watt reading light its maybe 500 lumens 40 watt reading lamp but it has no heat for the boat light
B000N9OZAO|3|The rubber seal around the lights are bad and rain does get in and also sometimes one light will go out and it's not the bulb. But I do love the look so I will have to improvise
B0085XV9JA|4|smaller than expected, but cute. Can only be used for small paper
B00A4G4NXA|1|Wrong product also cannot fit my bike.
B003YMTJ9O|5|Great deal  works great, not much more to say.  Buy it you will like it, LOL :)  happy driving to all

B000E4QGGO|5|Worked great!
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Really cool
B00BHNK0SG|5|The first time I have ever ordered anything like this before.<br />It was easy and the site was heaven to maneuver.
B007KSZQU4|5|Great value!
B00DJ5KEF4|5|JUST THE THING FOR CHARGING MY I PHONE WHEN RIDING MY BIKE
B000XBGFO6|5|Absolutely love these!  We got these when my kids were still young enough to get excited about reindeer.  We still put them on for about a month around Christmas every year and they've remained in great condition.  They're sturdy and easy to attach and they quickly became one of our annual holiday traditions.  We've even ordered 6 other sets to give to family as gifts!
B00HNGBPDU|3|These are a very good replacement for the factory tie rod. The reason I chose these is, that the replacement ends for these are the same for both ends. The replacement ends even fit the drag link. How easy is that? They are a breeze to adjust, right on the vehicle. The reason I didn't give it a five star, is Amazon's fault. These do NOT fit the Jeep Wrangler Sport, which has the 17 in aluminum wheels. This tie rod is a larger diameter and will contact the wheel and shave off metal. The fix is the 1.5 in spacers, but that should be disclosed up front. Many people installed these in the flip arrangement, I installed these in the factory position. To install the tie rod and the drag link in the flipped position, one has to install a lift kit, more than I want to do. If you don't lift the vehicle, when it comes down, it will land on the drag link. So I have ordered the spacers so that I can eliminate the wheel / tie rod contact.
B00G24610Q|4|Shipping took a while since the caps came from China, but it was expected since the price was so cheap. The wrench works fine and the caps look fine. They are installed on my Audi right now. From far away you cannot make out the Audi logo, but the logo does show up when you get close to the wheels.
B005UQQARG|5|great quality and Very durable
B005UJNH7E|5|This is the best glue for foam board you can buy! The foam around a glue seam will brake before the glue seam will. I don't think this would sand very well so I wouldn't use it on a balsa wood airplane.
B00DOZY586|4|I really like this Compact Subcool/Superheat Calculator and I have to say I was impress with it.
B00BRN5VEO|2|It is very loose and does not fit very well. The quality is OK be the fit is no good
B00D4C4Y3U|4|Yes, it's probably the most simple versin of this kind of tool, but it has a very convenient cost X bennefit relation.
B001JT1FJ6|4|I run this with every tank of fuel through my truck good pricing
B001GCOBBU|2|My girlfriend got this model for me for christmas.  I've been using them every nice day since the winter gave way to good riding weather (about 3 months).  Well, the soles at the toe are already ripping off on these.  C'mon, seriously?  I bought a $35 pair of el-cheapo boots at discount chain and they surprisingly lasted 4 years; so I'm more than disappointed that these 'high quality' boots will need to be replaced after a year.
B000MS830E|1|terrible.....  see photo.....
B00DUE721I|1|The original was in service for less than 3 months before it quit working. I returned it but after a couple of months replacement was returned to me with a note stating that there was nothing wrong with it and it shows extreme wear and tear. Excuse Me? The replacement item was NOT the original one I had returned to them and yes it did show extreme wear and tear. It wasn't even the one I had originally purchased and this one had the cord cover pulling away from the charging unit. But it worked so I just shrugged my shoulders and got on with the IMPORTANT things in life....... until...... 2 1/2 months later it quit working too! ....... you know what? I just threw it in the corner of the garage and will part it out later. In the meantime, I purchased another brand found on Amazon and it works just fine.
B0034NIFE8|5|This jacket is very good quality
B000C2WF6I|5|did its job and for the right price I just ordered 5 more to have on the side I do a lot of side work for people and it never hurts to have the things people always forget to pick up
B00GJXRCIA|5|Had to trim the plate to fit inside a clear tag protector (no negative on tag design). Looks great.
B008E32NJ6|4|Works good
B0078J1S9S|5|it was a gift - this was something very special to the receiver.  It was beautiful.
B001GJ3FIS|5|We bought it for our apartment.<br />Very good quality. It works as such advertising.<br />My wife and I will give you five stars.<br />Thank you
B00HZSLCIY|5|Best purchase I made for my truck. These mirrors increase my viewing angle 10 fold. Perfect plug and play for the 2004.5 Silverado 2500hd Duramax. They do have a little shake to them but they are not aerodynamic so thats to be expected.
B000GU5DKG|5|Its exactly what I needed to get my bike running again.<br /><br />Perfect fit, great item overall... I love it! AWESOME!
B002FOO7VC|5|Positivo
B004A0VBUO|5|Latches worked awesome and come with rivets to install. Extremely quick and easy upgrade from worn out hook latches. Only thing needed for install is a river gun.
B002DZJQ0A|5|arrived quickly - great price - great product
B0010AH6YM|5|Works as advertised, high quality OEM part.  It could benefit from detail documentation confirming the pin connections, but if plugging into a standard auto relay socket, it's a no brainer.
B001UJB9AU|5|good quality
B0002SA4SS|3|OK DEAL
B002YCE5V2|5|Solved the &#34;Check 4 Wheel Drive&#34; light.  Easy 5 minute - start to finish - install.  Check one of the many youtube video's.  Arrived 3 days after ordering with free shipping.
B000V6P9BS|4|Noticed a quicker throttle response from 1000-2100RPMS. I did see about a .5 MPG increase from before (same driving habits over a 2 week period). Install was easy. So far, so good
B000M5W25E|5|Very good
B000E4GFR4|4|The light fit into the car correctly and low beam seemed fine but when testing high beam ( turning it on) headlight seemed to get some fog in it and there is a rainbow hue behind the light. I have not pursued this problem yet. It maybe the lightbulb, just have not had the time to take headlight out and replace bulb to see if that is problem.
B004ROPQ2C|5|Love it.  Great fit and great look.  Good quality build.  Very happy with the purchase.
B000CQ264A|5|Just what I wanted.
B000BZI4K2|5|This sensors replaced old sensors O2 for my mazda tribute 2004, per mechanic recommendation I ordered all sensors for replacement in order to avoid more fails. very good price and product value added.
B005GO5E10|4|I GOT THIS ITEM FOR MY MOM TO HAVE FOR HER CAR.  I HAVE TRIED TO CHARGE THIS ITEM AND IT IS NOT CHARGING PROPERLY.  I WANTED TO HAVE THIS TO TAKE TO HER FOR MOTHERSDAY.  AMAZON HAS TAKEN CARE OF ME BY REPLACING THIS UNIT WITH A GOOD UNIT.  THANKS!!
B00NZLKT20|1|Stupid heater,.doesn't warm at all..take it out of the market...do not throw ur money on this crap ...
B0046KIABG|5|Works great, and much brighter than I expected.
B003VXRPL0|4|I haven't taken my car to the track yet since doing the brake fluid flush/bleed.  It's done well with my aggressive street driving and I would expect it to do well with light track use.  I don't see this as a full racing brake fluid.
B000CQFS0O|5|For anyone that has personally rebuilt an old car, these anti-corrosion washers are great.<br /><br />This package comes with 2 green & 2 red felt-style washers.  Each color comes with 2 sizes to fit a variety of battery terminals.  The price is right, the produce is fine.  A good buy.
B00029J0LE|5|I like it...easy to install...looks good...makes me look like I know what I'm doing..people now think I'm \\"right up town\\"!!
B00JB44VII|5|Great covers. The problem was the seat itself. Wasn't so easy to put the straps through. Now that they are on there, they won't be taken off any time soon.
B00690ALFE|1|I ordered this product for my father who is a sales rep and works out of his car everyday.  He has been very happy with the product for the last 2 months and then the slide out desk broke and does not close all the way and slides back out on its own.  I contacted the company and manufacturer to ask if they can either repair it or exchange it........considering he has only had it a couple months.  I am not trying to return it because he does like the product.  However both the company and manufacturer have been NO HELP at all and both said there is nothing they can do because its past the 30 day return mark.  They obviously run a very poor business that does not cater to the needs of their customers so that they will be return customers.  In my opinion DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY because if you have any issues they will not help you !!!!
B009EGLW5I|3|Doesn't fit my vehicle's steering wheel
B0028GJPPA|5|I pruchased these mats prior to the winter for my 2009 Tacoma extended cab.  If you want a great mat that will gobble up the snow and dirt then look no farther.  One of the best features is the easy out to clean.  I find that removal and cleaning is not a dirty process and there is no dirt left behind on the carpet.
B004ZF39ZY|4|Overall it is a good product. I have now been running this kit on my 1997 M3 for about 6 months and I haven't had a problem. I bought the 8k kit and it seems more like it is a 6k kit I dont know why.
B0009JB7GI|4|I mainly purchased this item as an &#34;extension cord&#34;. My only cigarette adapter is in my middle console & I needed somewhere to plug my radar detector into, which is where this item comes into play. The length of the cord is perfect & it seems reasonably well made. I'm happy with the item & the price that I paid for it. Recommended.
B003EOW5DY|5|Nice Bright white-ish blue i get double takes all the time
B004D0C18C|5|Great way to tap into any line for power etc. Used this to install various electronic items. Although not needed you can wrap in electrical tape for piece of mind.
B005DLLVWC|5|First one came without a pin; sent back to Amazon; replacement had a pin.<br />The pin, in part, was one of the reasons I bought this wheel; it is a really easy to use pin.<br />The wheel makes moving the trailer quite easy, even on grass.
B00GOY0W9K|5|I don't know how my original left turn signal lens got cracked, but the dealer quoted me $80 installed.  If I remember right, it would have been $50 for the part and $30 labor, or maybe it was the other way around.  Instead, I bought this part brand new for $19.40 total.  It came with a bulb in it, which I expected, so I now have a spare bulb.<br /><br />I replaced the signal lens myself.  There were no problems whatsoever installing the part itself, once I figured out and performed the steps required to access it.  (This task was more problematic largely because of the necessity of removing some plastic push pin fasteners, which are very difficult to remove without breaking.)  The part fits flush with the body unlike the original right turn signal lens.  I should replace that one to match this one, but I'm too frugal.<br /><br />I like the appearance of the new lens very much.  It looks very much the same as the original equipment except it has a slightly different hue when lighted, which may actually be due to the bulb color, not the lens. (I anticipated this possibility before I purchased it).  It looks a little nicer than the original equipment.  It works fine so far (I've had it almost a month), and barring the unlikely event it, too, gets cracked, I expect it to last as long as the vehicle.
B000HE2VF6|5|I bought these with an electric imact wrench.  The impact wrench was cheap and I sent it back.  These you couldn't pry from my cold dead hands, they're great!  Very nice set to keep in the garage.
B00LGVYI8W|5|Work great and are good quality.  Best price on the web.  If you've been strapping your car down this long without axle straps, you don't know what you're missing.
B002377MAE|5|One size fits all with an adjustable velcro strap. Soft cloth feel that has a laid-back everyday casual look. The blue version is more of a faded grape color and it DOES match the color of the picture so you be the judge. Made in China (isn't everything?).
B00FY810YI|5|My ignition switch was worn to the point my keys would fall out going down the road.  This item was easy to re-key to match my original key and install in my 1997 Ford Ranger.  About a quarter of the cost of having a locksmith fix the problem.
B000ZIZ32W|5|works on my windshield wipers and battery terminals. (Chrysler T&C)
B00020CB2S|5|im completely rebuilding my 95 civic,but one thing that had been bugging me is that no matter what i did to the car,no matter how much faster or better looking my car gets with every modification.if i took my girl for a drive around town in it,she always made a comment about how noisy the car was compared to her '11 camry.at this very point i've only covered my drivers door and underneath my back seat,i did this without her knowing.took her for a drive and she immediately noticed that the car was quieter. can't wait to finish the rest of the car.by the way it took me 2 sheets to do what i've done so far and i still have 7 sheets left!!!!
B004G9VIXE|5|Works perfect just like the OEM but much cheaper.  Saved a lot watched you tube video and did it myself.  In a 2005 Town and Country.
B00449GI8G|5|Adler is often an OE re box for Honda clutch and brake hydraulics.
B008A15XJE|5|Love this cover.  It really does the job in keeping my trailer clean for the winter.  I can't get the trailer in the garage so this cover is perfect.  I am very satisfied with it.
B0055AZECY|5|Excellent value and product. Easy to install on my 2000 Accord. Shipping was on time.
B001P2B862|5|I've put these springs on 2 different trucks, and loved them both times.  They picked up the back end a full 2 inches, and are not too stiff.  They ride great, and keep the back end level when hauling heavy loads.  I read on the manufacturer website, they add about 300 pounds of capacity in the bed.  I've got a trailer for 3 four wheelers and a boat that's just shy of 5,000 lbs.  With these springs, those trailers just about level the back end with the front.
B00884ZDT8|5|At the price I was not sure if it would do  much but it really works well.  I put it on a box that houses my solar charge controller and battery.  Temps get pretty high in the summer and needed a way to vent the box.  Perfect.  Easy to install and worked instantly.
B00138OMJI|5|Used these rope locks for a double Kayak carrier I made to mount on a ATV trailer.  They are &#34;QUICK&#34; and &#34;EASY&#34;..... unlike those cheap ratchet straps that are an absolute pain to deal with.
B00J4TX59Q|1|What an absolute piece of crap....have been tring to get this piece of crap to start for three days now...still waiting on papers to register also...save your money...buy a Honda...I wish I could send this back...Zero Stars...<br />Also there are no assembly instructions and the DVD they give you won't play....Garbage..
B00AAHOXWE|5|Worked great for my topper.
B0002YUGCQ|5|We bought two of these  and both arrived on time, are of great quality and we are pleased with this product.
B009UOIBB2|5|Have had this helmet for a while now. Nice product. Cheap but it's functional. Comfort is very good, fits well. Decent padding. Visibility is very good. Aesthetics are excellent for the price range. My only complaint(s) if I had to list one would be noise [It's a chatter-er (because of its visor)] and no inner dark sun shield. But overall quality is excellent imo. I highly recommend if budget is a key factor. I just wish somebody would make an ADV helmet like this that was modular so I can flip open the whole face and not just the face shield.
B00EVQI2TK|4|Very good quality for the price are perfect.
B000C9DHG8|5|Found it at a great price, plugged it in and has been working great.  I saved over $200 bucks.  I highly recommend.
B008J4HOXU|4|Put them on my golf Cart.  They worked great!
B008BITBLM|5|These headlights are a godsend for the price they're awesome they fit my 2000 Ford expedition perfectly. Just make sure you adjust them to match the ones you're pulling off it'll be a lot easier.
B000C7TVYW|4|Good product.. Extremly poor packaging!! Product arrived with dents and damage! Corners of the tank where bent in! Also the ring for the fuel pump that came with the tank was unrepareable it was bent into a U!! I would be conserned about this if you are putting it on someone elses vehicle.. If its your own and your ok with all the dents then its a good buy!
B0002LWFNM|5|We have a VW New Beetle......the window is deep and wide. We were seeing interior temps over 125 when left in the sun! The cheap gas station shades didn't fit right and didn't protect the car. My wife thought it was silly to pay $35 for this item, but it is worth every penny. It is cut perfectly to fit the Beetle and is made from a thick material, not just some cheap foil. Today reading was 104 outside, and in the car was 101 when we came out of the store! I know.....not frigid but so much better than what we have been experiencing here in Texas this crazy summer. So glad we bought it! We're going to buy for our other cars too.
B004F6FMEO|5|The cover fit perfectly. It is everything I expected and more. I was a bit apprehensive at first but when it arrived and was installed I was and still am thoroughly satisfied
B00BEIUDMC|5|EXCELENT
B008819L0I|5|Installed  on a 2012 tundra  long bed double  cab. Wireing  could have  been 3 foot longer  from rear  to front  box had to go next  to rear seat. But otherwise  works  good. Also bought  the extension.
B003IS3HV0|5|I am a little confused that if I go to the leather honey website it is much cheaper and i could have got double the product for the same money paid.
B00153T0AW|5|Great deal, from amazon again. Thank you
B002G246T6|3|squeegee part was detached on one side. there holes where screws should be to attach the way you would attach a sponge to a mop handle...but instead it was attached by flimsy soldering that breaks off withminimal effort. luckilyi hadsome screws and nuts that fit perfectly.  the telescoping handle is thebest part. i can use it with a fruit picker i just got and it's great.
B004GZ0U00|5|as advertized
B003IS3HV0|5|This reasonably priced compound softened the inside of some stiff new shoes to prevent toe irritation and also did a good job of waterproofing them. A little of it goes a long ways, and I highly recommend it. I used an old rag to put it inside the shoes by the toe area but it's not that messy and does dry out ok.
B003SS0AEW|5|Great quality and perfect size
B000ALJYEW|3|Mirrors were OK. Had a problem with the car --
B00HW8XSL6|4|These seemed like good quality however did not fit my shoes I wear an 11 and the large size says it fits to 11 but 10-1/2 would be the largest<br />that these could accomodate
B00T1BVYS6|5|Love!!
B003U1NPBW|4|I ordered these around Christmas time. I didn't receive them within the timeframe, so I contacted the seller and they resent them out at no charge. I read previous reviews and it stated that they had customized these. I contacted them and they said they weren't able to, so I had to buy multiple sets.
B000GVG08O|5|nice colored bulbs
B007ZDMH9C|1|When I first installed this conversion kit I was quite pleased. Now, on the other hand, I am deeply regretting that I spent any money on this product. I also think it's funny how one of my ballasts stopped working just a little bit after my return date had passed. As soon as it happened, I called Kensun but their offices were closed for the holiday, go figure and I was left with an answering machine. I left a voicemail with my name and number (stated several times throughout the message) and never got a call back, I think I even sent an email but I could be wrong there, my bad. Nevertheless, this product gave me a good two months of satisfactory enjoyment, but that is the extent of it. I will never buy this kit again. For all of those who are looking for a reliable HID conversion kit and would like to have a working one for longer than a couple of months, DO NOT BUY THIS.
B007FITCJ0|5|Perfect fit
B004TBOF3Y|3|I've got an '07 M Coupe for which run-flats are not recommended and there is no room for a spare, so this kit and that SOS button is all you've got.  For the first time ever I had to use the original kit to fix a flat that bad enough to cut the rubber on the sidewalls - zero air in the tire.  I could not believe that after using this kit the tire held air perfectly for 20 miles I had to go to get a new one - I even foolishly went over 50 for a bit.  I assume the product inside the container is exactly the same as the original, but haven't had to use it and this review is not about that.  I didn't want to spend almost as much as a new tire for a fix-a-flat solution on a whole new kit, or pay dealer prices for the replacement bottle shown, so I bought this.  The pump is just fine and reusable.  Thought I'd be smart and only buy this replacement product.  The two hoses and fittings that are a part of the kit will in all likelihood NEED to be replaced after the first use, since this glue-like chemical sealant solidifies in the hoses and in the attachment valve that connects to your tire and will need to be replaced as well.  This bottle and the white fitting piece that comes with it are different than the original with my car, and comes without the hose with valve fitting to attach to your tire from the airpump-forced sealant.  I've since been to three hardware stores and an automotive store looking for a compatible hose and/or air inflation valve to attach to a hose so that if I get another flat, I can use this sealant.  Each hardware store recommends another store.  I'll go to a bike shop next or just buy a manual air pump and use the hose and value from that perhaps next. I could have easily not noticed that the hose and valves were uncleanable and unable to be reused, and am glad I thought to check.  Thought I'd point this out to avoid somebody else out there doing the same and realizing they had this problem when they were stuck somewhere.  Although different, therest should work with my pump.
B00EVQHSUO|5|horn kit appeared to be very good quality and they are very loud
B007TYRLL6|4|Met my expectations
B000JWVA30|5|Great quality lawn mower engine oil drain plug.It withstands high operating temperatures while holding magnetic wear particles to the magnet.The magnet went on a 6.75HP Briggs & Straton engine push type lawn mower.
B00GBW8AGM|1|You cannot put these on Your car . They are white plastic backing not clear. Worked great on my shop notebook though.
B000VDSVU2|5|Perfect fit for Z1R Viper Vengeance full face helmet.<br />Excellent quality .<br />Light smoke color great for daylight glare.<br />Highly effective.
B003V5IVFC|5|Easy install, less than 10 minutes. They seem durable and add that little bit of extra protection.
B000QG0AKI|5|This tire spoon works great i baught it to change my tire on my 50cc moped and was perfect.This iron is very durable good bang for your buck.I would recommend this to friends.
B00FHB44FO|5|I bought this for the rear license plate for my Honda Ridgeline. Since we live in Ohio, you have to show registration stickers on the lower corner of the plate and this works perfect.<br />Pros:<br />The construction appears to be a rubberized plastic and feels pretty sturdy.<br />Looks great with vibrant colors.<br />Cons:<br />Would not recommend for a front plate if you go through automatic car washes with wraps that travel across the front of the vehicle.
B003ZAHTC4|4|I've been using a metal ramp and it has been showing signs of rust and use.  I work on several vehicles and on some, the bottom of the car body rubs against the ramp before the tires reach the incline.  Plus, the metal ramp will slide along the garage floor/concrete unless one puts down a strip of old carpet or other type of material.  Due to many of the above , I decided to look for something more safe.<br /><br />Before purchasing the 2 piece 67\\" Race Ramps, I consider what many did, which was to build my own using wood.  I can use it without fear because wood can withstand an incredible amount of force/pressure.  The only two issues for me was it would be very heavy to store, place out, and move around.  Also, I don't have any 2 x 6 or 2 x 12 wood on hand so I would need to purchase it.  Buying the wood would end up a fraction of what the Race Ramps cost (probably 25% of the cost) but wood is still expensive and the ultimate deterrent was the weight of the ramps after assembled, it would be very heavy, and harder to store and maneuver around.<br /><br />Ordered the Race Ramps, and once received, I gave them a try out.  They passed with flying colors.  Four individual pieces, each one very light weight, stacked on top of each other, they take a smaller amount of space in my small garage.  Low enough incline on the ramp, all the vehicles I work on can climb without any body part hitting the ramp.  The ramps are also an incredible 14\\" wide and once on the ramp, lift the bottom of the tires off the ground, a nice 10\\".  The 14\\" wide ramps give me additional confidence get going onto the ramps without worrying about if I am going on too much to one side or the other, with my older ramps, I feel like I'm on a tightrope, with these, I feel like I'm on a wide plank.  The 10\\" height gives me plenty of room to extend my arms, scoot under, and that's something I can't get with building my own wood ramps, unless I build up many layers.  The ramps also do not slide due to the grippy coating applied to them.  I can back up on the ramps or drive forward on to the ramps, either way, I feel 100% safer than the cheap plastic ramps or metal ramps.  I no longer have to rev up to go up a ramp and fear of overshooting it, these ramps allow me to slowing creep up, extra piece of mind.  With plastic ramps, they can give at any moments notice, once the plastic is compromised, they can crack and buckle, with metal ramps, I feel if the weld goes, they also can fold because of the lack of support.<br /><br />I chose this model over the others in the Race Ramp line due to the wider support, higher ground clearance, ease of working on the car because of the removable incline ramps once the vehicle is on the ramp.  I didn't give it the highest rating because the high price factor.  This should be able to be priced lower without affecting the quality of the product.  Still, I would recommend these if you can afford them and especially if you work on a multiple amount of vehicles.  These give the piece of mind and the larger margin of error for use and I'm glad I found these on Amazon.<br /><br />I also purchased the RR wheel chocks and provided a review on them separately.<br /><br />Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.grippy coating applied to them.

B009XUMTTS|1|this bottle must been seating a long time on the shelf the liquid was on top and the wax was on the botton i tried to mix it up but the wax didn't mix up to well like i said it was seating to long on sheft
B005ZS0QGA|5|Perfect fit.
B002FS5EL0|5|I needed to replace everything anyway, so I went ahead and got the quick struts. Easy installation, no issues.<br /><br />If your car has a lot of miles on it, I would recommend getting these. I usually change just the strut at first, but after that you might as well get the quick struts. then you get a new strut mount and coil spring, all assembled, ready to go.
B0077RM6D8|5|We ordered these to help with cross-country trips. They were extremely easy to install and held our luggage bag securely atop the Jetta Sportwagen for 1500 miles. They are a bit noisy when unloaded, so you will find yourself compelled to remove and store them in the garage as soon as you finish with them. A great product at a fraction of the price of those sold by VW dealers.
B00LNORRNU|3|I like these floor and carpet protectors, they fit well and they were shipped timely. However, I found the &#34;hold-downs&#34; on the drivers side to be loose, the factory floor mats snapped into place in a very positive fashion. The Weathertech hold down hardware was loose and allows for &#34;wiggle room&#34; on my application.<br />These are nice but I am not impressed, I like that are made in America and I like the versatility, I appreciate the engineering that went into them to insure fit and the laser technology used for measuring but I believe they are very over priced. I watched the price fluctuate between 94 dollars and 127 dollars for two front mats in a matter of days. I paid 97 dollars for mine. Based on the lack of a tight and secure hold-down and the gage of the material I believe a fair price would be 50 dollars however I will keep them, they work in my vehicle and they do protect my carpeting.
B0012TRIAI|4|These are very nice looking well built racks. I have one of the ATV's listed as a model these racks fit. (2007 Honda Rancher 420 ES) The racks themselves fit the ATV perfectly size wise. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is due to the supplied hardware. After looking at the hardware and attempting to make it work I opted to go to the hardware store and buy 10 Ubolts and<br />nylon locking nuts that are designed for mounting one inch pipe.<br />I then drilled new holes spanning the existing stock racks on the ATV.  I used four Ubolts for the front rack and six Ubolts for the rear rack. I also needed to use a dremel tool to cut off the excess on the Ubolts after mounting just to make them safer for items placed in the racks. The Ubolts and the nylon nuts ran about twenty six bucks at home depot.<br />Using this method the racks are solid as a rock and do not move or rattle in any way. I would recommend these rack highly and hope the manufacture modifies the mounting hardware in the future. If you want yours to fit solidly just keep in mind it may cost you a few extra bucks to make it perfect.
B005R4L6WA|5|One of the best finds yet. I purchased a similar set but ended up breaking a lens. I ordered these lights and they were better than the more expensive set. They come factory &#34;smoked&#34; and look almost identical to the $300 Recon set. Highly recommend these if you like Recons but do not want to pay for the name.
B00JV6UAPO|5|Needed brighter instrument lighting, and there are doing the trick
B001HZPWG4|5|Purchased all four struts for my 1999 Honda Accord EX 4 Dr and they fit perfectly.  The ride is greatly improved for a car with 160,000 miles for half the cost of local auto stores and even more from the Honda dealer.  The install was fairly easy after reveiwing U-tube vids.
B00429NKWK|5|Great product. Does what is says. Only issue I had was when UV Block Clear Coat cured it left streaks on the headlights. I followed the instructions and watched the video. Only wish I could get a reply why it left streaks on headlights.
B007XZJXLW|5|Makes the Jeep look like a new vehicle
B00CAX6LJ4|5|worked like advertised, follow the instruction closely and you will not have a problem.
B00H8PC7CO|3|one of the wingtips is bent
B0041RPGQ6|5|Purchased these as a Christmas gift for myself.  For several years, I drove a car that had heated seats.  Never realized how much I would miss them when I opted for a Mazda that didn't have them.  The Wagan cushions were a bit tough to install, but with a little patience, I got the elastic over the setbacks and got the tabs attached to my seats.  (I bought two.)  I also purchased the socket extender - kind of like an extension cord for the car.  I've been using these for about a month now in a very cold New England winter, and I am very happy with them.  The product has a high, low and off button, which is ideal.  Once the car warms up, it's nice to turn it down to low to just maintain a little extra heat on you back and bottom.  Highly recommend.
B000CPIMXK|5|First off baking the part is highly recommended but Do not use your home oven!  The fumes will bake into your oven which can be hazardous.<br /><br />This stuff takes a long time to dry fully cure takes 24 hrs without an oven. I ended up using a craftsman work light which cooked the part fairly well.  Wll post photos for this product after completion.
B000BN3TYK|5|The carburetor has save me gas and run\\"s great I recommend it if your boat is over 5year old. I love it..
B0001WW37U|5|What can I say about the CD holder?  It does as advertised.  One draw back is the pockets are large and, if not careful, you could push the CD way down and out of sight.  Takes a little practice to keep jusssssst the tip of the CD exposed.
B0009JKI5Y|5|I love Rain-X wiper blades, and discovering that I can purchase them online and save me a trip to the store... makes them even better!
B00BVL7LUY|5|a quality tool is always a good addition to any tool box.
B00029X5WO|5|Awesome Blades!  I had to order twice, I didn't realize you only get one blade and not a pair.  Whisper quite!!!!!
B00280BL9O|5|Does what it is supposed to do and works well. Cheap, no reason not to get it.
B001TO4WCS|5|The product was as advertised
B005GL8HXA|3|I returned it because it did not even come close to fitting the vehicle is was made for.  I had a decent return experience.
B000FDWJTM|4|This fit my 2002 Mercedes S500 like a glove. I like the fit for the mirrors and the hood ornament.<br /><br />The only reason I think it loses a star is because when rolled up you do not know the front from the back easily.
B00JRTPND4|5|Everything was exactly as it should be
B0066SOHVI|5|good
B002MC2Y9E|5|I've used the Sierra kit before and it seems to hold up well. Easy ordering and its at my door step. Larry Ceveland
B0091U4PJW|5|Great trunk item for the CX5 and now that we have it, cant imagine living without it!  Just needed something to keep the light everyday items in place when driving around.  Whether its groceries, gym bags, beach items, or travel luggage, this cargo net works wonderfully.
B006R181B6|5|Everything just as stated in ad. Looked great. Great price for what recived. Fast shipping. Great priduct. Will buy another if needed.Thanks
B001RBUZTM|5|I put these White Hibiscus Decals on my girlfriend's Cruiser bike and bike helmet [ASIN:B004XYIZ0G Nutcase Pacific Blue Metallic Matte Bike Helmet]. I ordered 2 decals.  They really look great and make the bike and the helmet look like they are a match set.  She really likes the accents they provide the bike.  I cut the decals apart to make them fit better in the space I had.  Also it was tricky applying them on the curved surface of the Helmet.  Even so they were pretty easy to apply.
B00OSCXAC6|3|Looks ok. I thought it would be slightly larger. This does not appear to be a high quailty item. Kind of flimsy.
B0091YWA22|5|Using these to replace the nearly impossible to access rear marker lights on my vehicle.<br />I've had them working in my car for a few months, and still work like new :)
B00S0O02HE|5|Easy to install and the adhesive back of the switch is like super glue. When it is stuck it is forever.
B0023VIHW2|5|A headlight like one this usually costs over $100. This was 50 bucks with shipping. I live in farm country, and I needed some new headlights for those dark country roads. These do the job, and at a great price. I would recommend this company to anyone.
B002DU3TTO|5|This was exactly what I needed but should have already been included in the package from the beginning.  A perfect fit!
B009VSOYBI|5|As Advertised!
B000CO9YME|5|Product works great. No complaints. Best feature is the compact footprint when folded and stored away. I've seen other users install a 8-10ton hydraulic ram for heavier engines.
B002BE6VIS|4|Got this for my husband and he loved it.  Gave only 4 stars because the sticker did not come in one piece, so it will be difficult to put on the car.  Still would buy it all over again though.
B00FS9K69I|4|Easy to work with, just will have to give it some time under the hood and see if it holds up
B00SXE4CCW|5|This cover arrived very promptly and the quality is excellent.  Much better sun protection than my previous cover.
B000A8MNB6|5|I've been trying to style up the car a little bit, while keeping the OEM look. I've had these for a little over a year, and they've held up great with the Mid West weather. Best deal that I found, and I'm glad that I took advantage of it!
B005MEZS4M|3|I was very pleased when I received the BMW plate but after only 6 months it is rusting and no longer compliments my car as it did when first purchased. I didn't expect to have to replace the plate after only 6 months of purchase.
B002M3KSK0|4|Works great, fits Mazda CX-9 well without sticking out on both sides, however, a good amount of wind noise.
B000NTE6LW|5|Fit and installation were perfect and easy.
B001UFXS26|4|Go to the Hellwig web site and down load their application guide.  [...]  The Amazon application guide says these will fit all the listed 2007 model Tacomas.  They don't fit 2005+ 2wd Pre-runners with the TRD package- aka \\"SPORT.\\"  The aft leaf in the kit conflicts with the factory leaf alignment bracket on the spring. There was a piece of paper in the box announcing that I needed to call an 800 number for a bracket kit to fit a 2005+ Tacoma pre-runner TRD.  Lovely. Shortest vehicle project I've ever done.  The aren't open on Saturdays.  I'll update this when I get the bracket kit. Fast forward, installation required some cutting with a grinding wheel to get clearance with the factory spring alignment brackets.  Not a big deal, but also not for the feint of heart.  Installation completed, and the springs are great.  Cures the squishy back end problem on this truck and helps with trailer towing.  But, get the application guide from Hellwig directly before you buy.
B006NSN7OE|5|This sticker is really cool. It's made of a great quality material and the colors are vibrant.<br /><br />Fast Shipping<br /><br />There's really not much else to say.
B001QVPHBO|5|Bought this to replace the screen on my macbook. Those screws are tiny! This screwdriver was just the thing. It's magnetization is a major plus, not only so you don't lose the screws as you remove them but also so you can hold them straight as you are trying to put them back in. I can't imagine how I would have completed my project without it. The right tools make all the difference.
B005TOLSBC|1|IT DID NOT WORK! DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A 2011 MALIBU. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A 2011 MALIBU
B00DJ5KE9A|5|This is a very useful accessory for those that have the battery tender quick disconnect ends attached to your car/motorcycle/truck battery.  Using this enables you to quickly check the battery voltage anytime - it gives a clear indication of the state of your battery.  I do wish the display were a bit bigger (since it's meant to be used under a car hood and all) but all in all a very good tool
B005CO9FDW|3|its good vacum pomp now i am used for one frigidaire an one freezer its my first vacuum pomp good
B000C9QV7U|5|Fit perfectly and installation was easy. Does what it is expected to do.
B000BNOIAO|5|I purchased my Lund Genesis Trifold for my 2500 Silverado in 2005.  It has held up extremely well in the intense Florida sun and is by far the easiest operating top I have ever seen.  When the back two plastic corners broke from someone trying to break into the truck I emailed Lund through their website about how to replace them.  Very quickly they got back to me, asked for my address and sent me all four corners at no charge.  I had the corners within two days.  The product is great and the company has very good customer service.
B003ZWHNG4|4|Quality replacement.
B00GQZP5P8|1|not bright at all nor is it a traffic advisor. it does not scan from right to left or left to right
B008KWIG0Q|5|it was a perfect fit for my 2001 Toyota Tundra, look so good and it was so easy to install.
B00C1MHM92|5|A+++++
B0012RI7DM|5|bought to go with our new hitch.  easy to install and had it set up in less than 30min.  have had for several years now and works perfectly.
B0087R141C|5|nice item
B00A3M6CIO|5|Very good product.
B00P2K08J6|3|I didn't expect it to be plastic but, it looks bad ass just the same (0       0)
B00366UBMC|5|This is an easy way to get all you need and keep from spending lots of money on a replacement engine!  Don't chance it!
B00802GEMS|5|I have bought many after market HID conversions and the KENSUN Slim Digital are one of the best I have used. They were easy to install and they seem built well. I will purchase these in the future.
B007T0DAZQ|5|I was looking for some tail lights with a more efficient reverse light. The reverse on these is great! It emits lines of light off the side of the car, which really help me see the different terrain and objects behind/ on the side of my car. ONly thing though is that the bottom inner light has no purpose! It may just be cosmetic, but it really has absolutely no function that I am able to discern.<br /><br />Also, does not come with bulbs!<br /><br />Installation is extremely easy aswell, can be done without any tools, unless the nuts holding the old ones are on really tight, in which case just a little socket will do the trick.
B00802FXVG|1|Poor quality the previous one I bought for my Ford F150 was far better !! These didn't last a month
B003TKI4VU|5|I was a little skeptical buying these after reading both of the #1 ratings that these bulbs are greenish and /or bluish white.  I don't know what heck bulbs they were rating but these ones I received are exactly what I wanted - a soft warm yellow white very similar to the incandescent #1146 in my RV.  Having lots of experience with different applications of LEDs they can be a harsh bluish white.  I ordered two of these and two of another brand without the plastic globe and a  higher lumen rating.  The second bulbs are definitely a blue white compared to these softer white.  If you want a non-glaring, soft, warm, yellow light, I'd recommend these.  I'm ordering a dozen of these now to finish out the interior of my RV.  And did I mention how cool these are?  No heat on the light lenses.
B000FPZXW0|5|great product
B000GU0MMU|5|I use this to change oil on my ski boat and lawn mower.  This is very easy to use. In under 30 minutes I can change the oil in my boat with no mess to deal with.<br /><br />Run the motor until the oil is hot, then stop. Insert the line into the dipstick hole and pump away.  Take the pump down to Auto Zone (or a parts store that recycles the oil) and recycle the dirty oil. Done!
B000CB42EM|1|For over sized wheel they say! I have on 20&#34; inch rims on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and I'm guessing this was definitely not the right Stabilizer for my Jeep... It's only been 2 months in and I have to replace it already!!! I was doing about 45 to 50mph on the highway when I felt this uncontrollable shimmy happening to my Jeep... I don't know if you've ever experienced it but that's not something I would wish on my worst enemy!!! I'm so scared to use my brakes so I realized that gearing down with the help of overdrive then number 2 helps more but I'm at risk of damaging my transmission!!! SAVE YOUR SELF AN UNNECESSARY ACCIDENT AND GET A PERFORMANCE GAS STABILIZER IF YOU OWN RIMS!!!!
B00537FBIG|5|Do not get rid of factory tow hook, Just bolts in place after dropping the muffler and installing hitch, no need to remove.
B00BI79FYG|5|mufflers fit perfect and look awesome on my 2012 streetglide !! highly recommend
B000IG3QOI|5|I had a requirement to determine if the engine rectifier/regulator on a airplane was overheating during ground operations and in flight.  The Bell Automotive 22-1-2800 unit met my need. I taped the sensor to the rectifier/regulator in the engine compartment then routed the wire linking the sensor to the  digital read out unit positioned in the cockpit.  The thermometer  provided the data I needed at a very nominal cost.
B00K0QRS7M|5|seems well built, very disappointed its made in china though
B007Y0D6J6|5|This wheel kit is AWESOME!  I love how oversized everything is!  I have seen many wheel kits over the years and I have never seen anything as nice as these!  I have these on my Extreme Max Lift and my buddy put them on his American Lift  after he saw how nice these are!
B000GZL1QQ|5|Thank you
B00180FWEU|5|This part which is heavy-duty commercial service quality was HALF the price on amazon compared to the same Moog part quoted to me at several local auto parts suppliers.  It has grease fittings which eliminates wear and sloppiness that happens with factory OEM sway bar links.  Five stars.
B000YXIZU0|3|doesn't quite fit on my ATV rack, so had to make modifications and use some of my own hardware. Works ok....because ATV's bounce a lot, if you don't have covers on buckets, expect the contents to be all over the trail behind you.
B00EKTIKUY|3|They do not cover the entire area...looks like an add on
B002692308|4|Fit well however I've had this less than a year and the adhesive is already shot, leaving it hanging on my tailgate
B000CD8I5O|1|I ordered the the wipers and they were shipped to me on Jan 7. 2010.  They were delivered on Jan 14 2010.  I installed them on my truck on Jan 29, 2010.  I washed my truck today and noticed the rubber had already seperated from the wiper.  When I checked I am out of the time frame to return them for replacement.  Save your money and go buy a cheap set.  They would last longer than these wipers do.
B000BKZHDY|4|Headlight assembly arrived promptly and as described.  When installed by mechanic the high/low beams pointed upward so had to be removed, beams adjusted, and reinstalled at added expense. No instructions were included with item.
B000TKHMWK|4|I have one of these and like it a lot.  Its nice and portable. I did buy it from amazon and got it shipped for free. I bought it as a power supply for my telescope equipement and it meets my needs just fine.  I have also used it to jump my car which id did well.  I have read bad reviews on this.  I would say that there are other power options out there.  First you could buy a Deep cycle trolling motor battery and simply buy a power inverter (which isn't an expensive device) for that as well as a deep cycle charger.  That would cost more money howerver it is a much more powerful battery and will last longer.  In the long run would be cheaper option if you had a lot of power needs and needed more than one batter.  And  its easy just to replace the battery if it goes bad.  The other option is that there are a number of small light weight gasoline powered portable generators out there.  Honda makes the best but they will cost you a arm and a leg.
B00N27D4VK|4|Not the best quality carpet but does the job
B009E9KKUS|5|Thank you.  It worked perfect.  Just what I was looking for!
B00LPBBNRC|5|Exactly as advertised. nice grip, solid fit in my XC60
B001V8U3J8|5|Perfect fit. good value. Thanks
B00159BL44|4|I should have bought a FRAM Fresh Breeze cabin air filter instead.     Filter comes with fancy packaging.  I don't understand why the manufacturer would need a cardboard box almost twice the size of the filter to package the filter.  I guess they need a bigger box to advertise the \\"Bioshield 75\\" treatment applied to the filter so that you \\"ride healthier\\" and that you \\"don't drive around in a toxic cloud of dirty air any longer!\\"  When I did an online search for bioshield 75, I came across some information that indicated that the treatment lasts about 90 days.  My car's service manual indicates cabin filter replacement every 8 months/8,000 miles.  If bioshield 75 was an important feature for me, I would have to replace this filter every 3 months.  Besides, I drive around in the city with my window cracked open most of the time.  So I am already \\"driving around in a toxic cloud of dirty air\\" anyways, with or without this filter.    This filter, by itself, is very reasonably priced.  But compared to Fram Fresh Breeze, it, in my opinion, lags behind. I have bought Fram before, and Fram feels sturdier.  And Fram doesn't come in a fancy packaging.  When I bought this filter it was priced a bit less than the Fram and I decided to give it a try.  Last time I checked, I saw that the Fram was priced a few cents less than this filter.      In the future, if the pricing for the Wix and Fram is similar, I am going for a Fram.
B00D38PFGU|3|What can I say great cover up for a while not a bad price too.
B0034ZUZM6|4|Installation was  easy with all parts included. I did not buy the adapter plate becouse for the $72  I was planning on making my own. As it was the unit bolted right on with no adaptor needed.
B000H0QR9G|4|Probably technically illegal on the road, but brighter than stock 65/55w bulbs (when used with a good relay harness) and way less obnoxious than an HID kit.
B00B76RXRY|5|The fender flares fit great & look even better.
B002ZKGUOI|4|I've gone through 2 of these in the past 4 years. Maybe 3 of them? I have only had one fall off because I forgot to hook it on.<br /><br />The luggage itself is very good. It holds onto your bike with these 2 bungee cords with hooks on the ends and has a pad on the bottom to keep it from sliding. On a standard bike (I had a hyosung 650) it fits nice and snug. On my slightly sportier Honda CBR, it fits poorly and slides a little which makes me nervous. The bungee cords also stretch a little after a year or so.<br /><br />It has the capacity of a school backpack, or about 50% more if you expand the side pockets.<br /><br />The major downside is that I sometimes forget to hook the cords down or zip up one of the pockets and I can't see it because it's behind me. I think I'm going to get a magnetic tank bag now that I have this CBR.
B004JRMIUU|1|These bulbs don't work even after switching polarity.  Not sure what they work on but not my scooter.  Save your money unless you know for sure they will work on your vehicle.
B001TYMK1S|3|The seat covers look as they do in the photo as far as colors are concerned. I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the fabric is, however they do not fit properly. They come with numerous little hooks to place in the hopes of a correct fit, but it's near impossible to make it perfectly smooth and fit like it does in the photo.
B002E4Q7N4|2|If your looking at the same picture that I saw you will notice the plastic divider on the filter.This helps with support and the filter pleats stay straight and wont bend making it a stronger filter.The one they sent does not have it.It`s a cheaper version than advertised.Also its a little flimsy too.I am going too keep it and give it a try but I wont order this one again.You get what you pay fore!
B00NNFL21A|5|Fit on my 2015 GTI like a glove.<br />They look great also.
B00B2YHFO2|5|Can't bet the price for 8 bulbs. just wonder how long there going to last.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fast service and the sunshade works perfectly.
B0068ODC1Q|5|Works as good as if it came from the dealer!
B000GGOOZK|4|The shield is great but the operation of it is tight. Sometimes I have to use both hands to close it from the open position. I have had other helmets and sheilds and have not have them operate as tight as this one.
B0039V9VCA|3|I installed this set of lights on my 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Upon opening the box I found they were well packed in individual cardboard boxes with plenty of bubble wrap. Upon initial inspection I thought I really scored having paid less than $60 for all six lamps.  However during installation the old adage of \\"you get what you pay for\\" came to mind.  They are Chinese made copies of the standard Jeep lights.  Ok, so I know....everything is made in China.  However on my particular pair the lower right turn signal has a plastic/warp deformity that prevents it from fitting exactly right.  No big deal, but then I installed the right headlamp and it sits really crooked.  I mean, the clearance along the bottom of the headlamp from the top of the turn signal varies from 1/4 on one end to over 1/2\\" on the other.  In engineering it's called \\"tolerance stack-up\\".  One part is a little bit off, the next part is a little more off, and it all adds up.  Makes me long for factory tolerances.<br /><br />The other side fits the same.  Net result, good-looking clear plastic lenses and throws light better than my old, yellowed factory lights. They're just not as nice as I was hoping.  Not horrible, but not super great either.  If you just need new lights for your old Jeep these will work.  If you really care about aesthetics and straight lines, open your wallet and get the OEMs.<br /><br />I'd probably still get these again because I'm on a budget, but they are definitely not 5-star.
B0010E3JVC|5|Nice item. Great Seller.
B004AIKY40|4|Awesome price for common issue (GM recall on Impala)  I don't know why its listed as Chrysler?  I used it on an Impala and worked like a charm !
B00LSYW82U|5|Arrived on time. Plan to install on the front of my motorhome.
B008G2MELM|5|thank you arrived as described ;packed very good.
B005HBTGNO|5|Great boots for the money , would recommend these to anyone, there was no need to break them in ready to go
B000CIRRC4|3|I purchased this light bar to mount antennas rather than use magnetic mounts.  The thing that appealed to me was the roll-over feathure so I could lower the antennas for parking garages and similar low clearance situations without having to remove the antennas.  To roll the bar over, you need to loosen the bar from it's mounts with an allen wrench - this is actually a bit annoying especially if you find yourself in an area of low clearance unexpectedly.  The general idea is a good one, but I think the engineering of that roll over feature needs to be more quick-release friendly.  I will also mention this is the only light bar I found that had this roll-over feature.  My other critique is that not all the hardware that comes with the bar appears to be stainless steel (some it some isn't).  I invested some extra $ and swapped out all the hardware I could for SS, and primed/spray-painted what hardware I couldn't replace.  So far, no rust.  This light bar can be installed by one person - I did it - but two people is better.  You will likely have to cut the bar to fit your vehicle exactly.  This is not a complicated affair so long as you have good tools and take the measuring slow and sure before cutting.  Been in use 2 years now and no complaints - has never come loose on it's own, though I do check it from time to time to make sure it's still secure.  Also note that I did use the gutterless mount kit which comes separately.
B0000AY69N|5|This product works well on my gazebo canopy and on my pool cover. Thanks
B00NLMHHR8|1|Flies off as soon as the wind blows. Don't waste your money on this!
B005E39NS8|5|I bought a 2011 Chevy Silverado and only got one key with the truck so instead of paying $30-$50 or even the ridiculous price the dealer wanted to charge for a new key I purchased 2 of these key blanks and had a local key store cut these keys using my original key I already had. Once the keys were cut to my key I looked online and learned how to program them to my truck and that only took about 3 minutes and was very easy to do myself. The keys work perfectly and look identical to my OEM key in every possible way and work just as well too.<br />  This is a &#34;no brainer&#34; get this key like I did and have it cut at your local key shop and save yourself a TON of money.<br />The way I programmed my key was to take my original key and put it in the ignition of my truck, turn the key to the on position for about 10 seconds (until all the dash lights go out) then turn the key off and remove it. Take the new key within 30 seconds and put it in the ignition and turn it to the on position for about 10 to 15 seconds, then turn the key off and remove it, BAM! the new key is programed, simple as that! Now you can put the new key in and start your vehicle. Remember you do need to remove the new key after the programming process and then put it back in the ignition for it to start your vehicle.
B002R0SF08|5|was great good service
B00NRLCF5C|3|Decal looks great it even looks like the ones a car comes with originally. The only problem I had is decal seem to start losing strenght. Still on the car though.
B008RDL78G|5|Great product for the money. No need to buy from Mopar.  After reading countless Amazon reviews I was able to install the cross bars correctly. Instructions included in the package are useless.
B00351V582|5|Fast shipment form seller. Good quality and fit perfectly. Takes minutes to install, good product!
