B000E5U3ZI|5|Vehicle: 2009 vw jetta 2.5L S 89,000 miles<br />Easy to install. Noticeable performance difference once installed. K&n filter are far superior when compared to regular air filters. It's incredible the amount of dust and dirt that can accumulate in the filter.
B00H8YAX1W|5|Nice bulbs
B00RTLUPVC|5|You can unscrew the flexible section to use it as a filtered funnel. I bought it to filter the gas going into my lawn tractor. Always lots of grass and dirt that wants to get into the tank. I store it vertically on a nail in the shed to keep the dust out. I was originally looking for ss screening to insert into the gas tank opening.
B0027XEKQ8|5|Works great!!
B00WSCKP0S|1|Works but is not gates power link. No markings on it at all
B00VXFKGE6|4|I have a side patio where I have just a few plants, unlike my backyard which is chock full of plants. This side yard gets eastern sun only and I've put out some succulents there, which means I only need to go out there 1-2 times per week, at best, to water. I do have to clean the patio off once a month or so as well.<br /><br />Because my needs at this area of my house are vastly different from my heavy-duty needs in the backyard, I have a much lesser hose on that spigot and needed to replace the nozzle. I purchased this Etronic hose attachment and it arrived quickly via Prime.<br /><br />Looking at it, it's nothing special. It looks like any other handheld hose attachment.<br />But as you screw it on, you get the feeling it's well made. It screws on smoothly but very sturdily, and upon turning the water on, there was no leakage at all.<br /><br />What's most impressive is the sheer strength at which this nozzle will spray! I do have really good water pressure at this house, so bearing that in mind, this tiny little thing is good to make you take a full step back when it sprays that water!<br /><br />The shower function is extraordinarily good, strong and even. The flat function, as is the case with any handheld sprayer, is not very useful for me. I need a wand to really effectively use the flat spray. The jet function is good--not the best--but it effectively removes the webs and dust that can build up out there over the course of a month. It also is fair enough in washing off all my patio furniture--no complaints.<br />But none of them are as good as the shower function on this head, and luckily, that's primarily the spray I use anyway for my plants. That, or mist, which is also as I'd expect.<br /><br />My favorite is still this: [[ASIN:B004RUFCUC Orbit Hose-End 58674N 36-Inch 9-Pattern Turret Wand with Ratcheting Head]]<br />Nothing really compares to the sheer functionality and strength of this wand, but wands are not to everyone's liking. If a handheld nozzle is more your thing, I find the Etronic one to be quite sturdy and useful at a very fair price. Cheaper models exist, but it's nearly guaranteed you'll need to buy a new one each year or spend additional money on rubber stoppers, etc. to try and get the nozzle to work right. With this Etronics model, it's quite literally attach and go.is more your thing, I find the Etronic one to be quite sturdy and useful at a very fair price.

B007EGE8O2|1|can buy a Lowes for 2.95 a can!
B00LIXEWXO|5|Great Stuff, I didn't know but this is only 1 single sheet.  Not cheap, but I didn't need a ton.  I lightly wet sanded some scratches from my car with no training and then buffed with compound using 3k and 5k grit.  They came out perfectly!
B00SL2STX4|4|This cargo carrier is a great deal. I bought it because it is aluminum and inexpensive.  I needed the light weight to go on a Prius and it was great.  The imperfections are: They drill a couple sloppy holes in a couple slats to bolt the hitch frame in a different location for shipping.  Once it is assembled, you have a couple sloppy holes in a couple slats.  Just cosmetic.  The other imperfection is it comes with only 4 holes for tie-down hooks and my ratchet tie-downs from Home Depot (pretty standard items) did not fit.  I spent some time drilling and slotting additional holes so I could tie down more boxes and from both directions.  Now I'm very happy with it.
B001CEG90I|1|Didn't fit my car even though chart showed it as the correct size.
B000C57YOI|5|Great buy, exact fit for my vehicle.
B00FZQ5UT0|5|Thanks
B009M1VO6C|3|Decent lights for the price.  If only the caps on the ends of the lights would stay together instead of leaving the light itself exposed
B00V4049K2|5|Works wonders, can't even smell my hockey gear or my dog's odor in the car

B00C5T2I54|1|I ordered the bra for a 2014 CRV and got one for a 12/13 CRV.  The headlight openings are in the wrong place. So far no response for the refund and/or replacement.
B003R7LP7K|5|Replaced my 2007 Yukon Denali handle cause apparently GM can't even make door handles right! This saved me a fortune and was easy to install.

B000F5LIFG|5|I should have purchased it years ago!!
B00O042A46|5|Nice quality good price
B002P37DKK|5|This is a top notch product. Andersen Manufacturing should be proud. I love my Ranch Hitch, this is the second one I have had. The first went with the first 5th wheel trailer I had which was sold. Now I have another 5th wheel trailer and I put a new Ranch Hitch on it. They are great to put on, and they are a blessing when you back up under them to load the trailer. Great product, can't say enough good things about it.
B00W78E7AC|4|I should have given them 5 because they are excellent considering what I paid. But, if I spent more, I could have gotten better.
B004GCY9A0|5|Exact replacement and perfect fit.
B004QCCKV0|1|This seal has a metallic shield which will not allow<br />the drive axle to position properly. The axle shaft<br />support bearing bracket will not go over the dowel<br />pins in the cylinder block. Ended up using an O.E.<br />rubber seal, and the TO-68 went into the trash bin.
B007K8AA7I|5|I was on the market for headlights that look great and produce amazing light. These lights do just that! They make my Jeep look great while keeping the night bright. The install was so easy an 8 year old could do it. Very happy with these lights and would definitely recomend if you're looking to spend some money, it's worth it.
B00ACGI1GW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000IEZEHM|5|It's a good product for the price.
B00279JM4W|3|The box is good quality and I would have given it 5 stars but it was shipped without the keys. I have other weather guard boxes and I was lucky enough to have a key that fit this lock - otherwise I would have returned the box. I emailed Weather Guard with the problem 6 days ago and they have not responded which suggest that their customer service is on par with their shipping keys with their boxes.

B0023VIMCW|5|We needed a replacement front headlight for our Toyota Camry because it was all hazy. We had tried several products to try and get the haze off to no avail. We only needed one because an accident provided us with one new one. So the car looked really bad with one new one and one old one. We ordered this part and under an hour my husband had replaced the old headlight with this one and it looked just like the one from the dealer. I give this 5 stars because it is as good as you will get from any dealership.

B010DP8PIU|5|Update 9/25/2015: Yesterday, I bought a 2008 Toyota Highlander V6 3.5L from a salvage auction.  The battery was completely drained, and I could not start it.  I pulled out my traditional jumper cables, but then remembered that I had the Anker Jump Starter sitting in my other car.  I connected the clamps to the terminals, saw a solid green light, and then my brother-in-law immediately started cranking the starter without waiting at all.  After about 3 seconds, the engine started.  Now, had he waited the prescribed amount of time, it would have started within half a second.  What impressed me was that despite this jump starter being recommended for up to 3.0L engines, I was able to start a 3.5L engine easily.     First of all, this jump starter is very compact.  It leaves one wondering how such a small device can pack enough punch to start a 3L engine.  One thing for sure, ladies will love its simplicity, compact size, and stylish design.  I have yet to try its jumpstarting capabilities (right now the batteries in my cars are both fine).  Still, I tried to attach it to battery terminals on my 2007 Honda Accord V6 3.0L to see what it would do.  It kept blinking red and green, never turning solid green.  I don't know why, but perhaps my battery did not need charging.  As you will see from the pictures (taken without a flash), its flashlight is decent enough to illuminate under the hood.  Speaking of its IQ USB charging ports, I like them just like I enjoy other Anker chargers with IQ technology.  To get the full picture of its capability, I drained the batteries on my iPad mini 3 and my Motorola Moto X completely.  Then I took the jump starter just as it came out of the box without charging it additionally and plugged in both my devices into the jump starter.  2 hours and 12 minutes later, my phone was 96% charged, and the iPad mini 3 was 58% charged.  At this point the jumpstarter was dead.  I don't know if it was fully charged from the get-go, as the only gauge I hadwas the yellow charge indicator light on the jumpstarter itself, which shows in increments of 25%.  So if my jumpstarter was at 76% charge, all 4 bars could be lit.  I will try this test again later, only next time I will make sure I fully charge the jumpstarter before using it to charge electronics.
B0038KVOZE|5|Great price and product.
B003TU662Y|1|Don't use on seats I did a test spot and lift up too many swirls and material. I don't like the way it leaves the carpet either. Sucks.
B0000AY9W6|3|Stops a basic trailer.  Which they were a little sturdier or offered a Heavy Duty version for large trailers, but this will do.  Like that if I ruin or crush one I can just get another for a few bucks.
B00DMHS1JK|4|Tight fit to go in. I read the reviews of these falling apart, so I took the liberty of applying crazy glue. These don't come with as many LEDs so when you see other folk driving around their Camaro's with brighter DRL you will see why these cost $10 less than the iDJMToy ones.
B00NPL7VVW|5|Works great
B000KL11K2|5|If you have a 2006 Ridgeline, you can't go wrong with this.

B0015PPWBG|2|I have had two sets of these in 3 years both had the same issue the mounts fell into pieces. The first set lasted a month then the lights fell out. The second about a year and a half. Trying to get in contact with the company is pretty much not ever going to happen they will just ignore every email you send if it pertains to getting replacements cause yours failed. they look nice and are bright but they are junk. If you want to buy tail lights every year these are the lights for you.
B0002JMF98|5|as described
B00EF1EW6S|5|Really nice perfect fit on my 2015 Silverado.  Looks great looks like came from the factory with them on it. Fit with Factory molding that comes on the fender just take out the 2 torn screws put on the clear paint protection film. But first clean the edges so the 3m tape will stick. I recommend using both 3m sticky tape and adding the additional screw.
B005H7DRQA|5|Works very well on my car interior both to clean and keep nourished.  Nice smell too!
B0007WJQ6K|1|PRODUCT RAITING: 1-Star (I hate it).<br /><br />Even though customer service (Joe) was 100% awesome, and I wish there was a separate rating category for customer service, I have to be honest about my review of the Lund 95075 Genesis Tri-Fold Tonneau Cover product. Despite this cover arriving damaged, the cover did not fit my 2015 Ford F-150 XLT 5'5&#34;-bed truck. The 2015 Ford F-150 beds aren't 100% square, so this cover did not fit. When I tried to make a side of the cover flush on one side of the bed, there would be a 1-2&#34; overhang on the other side/corner. It was just not even no matter how I arranged the cover. If I tried to make the cover flush toward the front of the bed, there would be less than 1/2&#34; coverage on the tailgate, making this cover unsecure. I simply did not like this cover. Some reviewers on the Lund 95072 product mentioned that they liked the fit, but I'm not sure they set it up correctly.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5-Star (I love it).<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I wish I could give customer service a rating, because Joe deserves 5-stars! I initiated a return for the defective product via Amazon and I later received an email from Joe. I sent the appropriate pictures showing the damage. Joe and I discussed alternatives and he was able to find a new cover that actually fits my 2015 Ford F-150 XLT 5'5&#34;-bed truck. I was very appreciative of Joe's efforts to make my purchase and experience right. He was very professional. My new cover arrived quickly and fits perfectly on my new truck! Thank you, Joe! You deserve 5-stars!<br /><br />Note: If you are in the market to find a tonneau cover for your 2015 Ford F-150 XLT SuperCrew 5'5&#34;-bed truck, I strongly recommend the RUGGED LINER Premium Vinyl Folding Tonneau Cover, Part #: FCF5515. I promise you'll like the fit, quality, and style.

B00E6AENL2|5|I received these pegs pretty quickly in the mail and was pleasantly surprised when I opened them as the add didn't mention that these pegs have replaceable cleats just as the high dollar name brand pegs do. They fit perfectly,  no slop at all. They are about the same length as stock pegs but about twice as wide. Awesome pegs for the $$$!

B00YC28OUU|5|Great price for a great product
B003XU0BFS|4|I have been having a similar problem to the other review. The radiator by itself fits very well, It just drops right in. The factory fans on the other hand don't fit very well. I also had to beat the weld seam on the cross member flat against the cross member in order to get enough clearance to fit the fan brackets in and to get the drain plug out. I had to make extensive modifications to the driver side fan in order to get it to clear my turbo. I will either have to get a new motor mount or shave the factory motor mount on the passenger side fan for the fan blades to clear the mount. This is a beautiful radiator and I really want to give it 5 stars but can't with the amount of modifications I had to make to the frame to make it fit. I can't imagine any other radiator out there is any higher quality than this one.
B004GFS2C8|5|Follow the directions.  Take your time.  You will have professional results like I did.  This worked as well as the $40 repair job offered by our local quick oil change place.
B000CITK8S|5|Last year I purchased a different brand after I dropped and broke my first Battery Tender Jr. I learned my lesson as that other (from a known brand) could not keep a good charge, my battery fully died over the winter, and I was forced to buy a new one. When I bought that I purchased this new BT Jr. and its performing 100% on point. Highly recommend this above any and all other tenders.

B000HZT89C|5|This is the best of the bunch that I looked at.  It's not super complicated with bags and compartments and such, just two mesh pockets for bottles, a tissues compartment, and one big compartment for trash.  I actually use the big compartment as a catch all for little toys and a can of disinfectant wipes.  I have a small car and I love how it only covers the top half of the seat back, so it won't interfere with the kids' legrooms in the back.
B00267PZUK|5|Oh my gosh!!! You won't be able to do this massive undertaking without this tool. You could literally save a thousand if you started this job and broke 7 out of 8 in the head (like I did) and then need to call a tow shop to take your truck to the &#34;stealership&#34;. Thanks to the tool I was able to successfully take all of the broken ones out.  It works great. Just have patience and know what you are doing before you start. There are a number of good videos on YouTube and the F150 forums to help you figure the tool out.<br />A couple of tips - you will need a way to blow or suck out all the pieces of broken porcelain and corroded metal from the cylinder head because pieces will fall down inside. Compressed air is a must. To suck the pieces out after I removed the broken plug, I used a 2 foot long section of clear 1/4&#34; tubing and rigged it to a shop vacuum hose by sealing the end of the shop vac hose with duct tape. I then cut a small hole in the end of the tape and inserted the clear tubing through it making sure to seal the tubing all the way around. You can then blow as much out with the compressed air and follow up by placing the tubing into the spark plug well and getting as far down as possible. I also took a coil pack rubber boot, boot only, (which you have to remove anyways) and placed it in the spark plug well and then inserted the clear tubing down the boot opening to create more suction. I could see the small fragments getting sucked up through the tubing.
B005JUOG9W|5|Don't forget to pay attention to size of plate. Plate wasn't long enough had to mount with holes already on bumper. Also needed to get two more screws. Love the plate looks expensive.
B00GWFOSRS|5|I believe this item is accurate. I have no tested it up against any others but it does what it is supposed to and is easy to read. The color scheme is nice as well to give you an idea of where your tread life is at.
B000LY0TWE|2|Hookers quality has gone down the tubes, looks like someone used a disc grinder to machine the flanges on the head ports and end mill in a drill on the exhaust flange. Copper gaskets were not enough to seal gaps and now I'm trying aluminum gaskets that our .094 thick.
B000GS1LZY|5|This is the BEST thing I did for my bike. I was toying with others but this has a WOW factor and it really helped.

B003ZOH63W|5|We use our Travel Trailer mostly on our lot in a very remote area in the Colorado Rockies.  It is a well-known fact amongst all of our neighbors that there is no broadcast TV reception, and satellite is the only option.  I bought this digital antenna to replace the standard broadcast antenna that was on our trailer.  Installation was very easy, and this antenna was an exact replacement for the one on our Coachmen.  I set the TV to scan for channels, just for the heck of it, and went outside to get our evening campfire going.  Low an behold, a few minutes later my fiancé was calling me back inside, very excitedly, because we were actually receiving channels from Colorado Springs.... which is about 75 miles away as a bird flies, through solid mountain terrain.  I was, and still am, amazed at the reception this fella pulls in!
B00UHD4HJA|5|love it!
B0000AXY5Y|5|Exactly  as I expected. It arrived on time and installation was easy with all the parts supplied. It works easier than the original equipment that came on the boat trailer.
B004AITV9Y|1|Didn't work on my 2011 chrysler town and country despite saying it would.  Cost me three hours of my time and $50 for garage to install, test and uninstall.
B0055AW0N0|5|Hesitated to get this as it was on backorder.  But it showed up in a timely fashion and works so well my friends are asking me where I got it.  Amazon, of course!  I am using it in a Dodge Caliber if that makes any difference.
B000C5WFDS|4|Had to splice the wires for 2001 Miata. Other than that it works fine. My OEM parts had Mitsubishi mark on it.
B00J11DY02|3|The manuals and videos from governing that you can find online and the one that comes with the product do not match the real system to attach the back bottom part of the seat cover. This is only one piece to start, not two separate parts like the images everywhere show. Also de two hooks hang from the back not from the sides of the cover. So it was really frustrating not knowing how to adjust de back side bc I was concern with the covers not being compatible with the airbag under the seat.<br />I hope is properly connected I'm not sure it is still at this point. Coverking should look into this issue and inform its clients before this becomes a bigger issue.

B00AK90LAK|5|These are authentic, genuine, weather tech products. They are fantastic and perfectly fit my 2012 Chevy Suburban.<br /><br />Let me review the company first, because the customer service I received was first class. First, before they shipped, they wanted me to double check my product numbers with Weather Tech's website. DO NOT TRUST THE AMAZON CAR FINDER. Go to the weather tech website, get the product number for your vehicle, then search for that number in Amazon. That way you know you got the right one for your year/make/model. I confirmed that with the seller, and they shipped it right away.<br /><br />Shipping - two notes. 1. I got these way faster than expected. Even before the earliest expected date. Maybe that's to do with my location, I dunno. But well done! 2. These are a rubber product that are shipped somewhat rolled up. Well, the mats for the front seats are not rolled up at all, but the mats for the middle and 3d row are folded. If you get the mat for the trunk space it will be rolled up. This makes some of the edges come up instead of lie flat. I emailed the seller, and they promptly looked up a solution for me (it involves using a hair dryer and putting heavy stuff on the edges). I am very impressed with the customer service.<br /><br />Now for the product. These mays are fantastic. They keep everything off the floor and on the easy-to-remove-and-replace mats. However, I want you to consider the one and only downside to these, and the one and only upside to carpet : dust from your shoes that used to get rubbed off into the carpet will now stay on your shoes, so expect some dirt and dust everywhere your shoes touch. If you only have adults climbing in and out of your car, this shouldn't be a problem. If however you bought a suburban because you have 5 monkey children like me, this means you have to invest in some cleaning wipes and some time to clean everything up.<br /><br />Honestly, that is the only critique I have with these mats. I love them, andwill likely buy them for future cars.
B00BC08EFA|2|I personally did not like the look or feel.
B0010E00T6|4|After market product.  Cheap replacement.  Slightly larger than OEM but fits and I bet does the same job.
B002VIVVFW|5|Product was as advertised
B010NHSNKS|4|These are great for applications where the bulb is facing the lens. If your lamp has the bulb side mounted it won't provide as good of light since this specific bulb has the emitters in the socket. There are other styles of bulbs where the emitters are outside the socket and can be seen from the side if you need that.<br />The light is very blue-white. Almost no heat, tiny current draw, and bright light.<br />Before you write off dead bulbs as defective, be aware that LEDs are polarized and you must have the positive and negative on the right wires, so turn on the circuit and try putting the bulb in the other way around in the socket.<br />I put in 15 of these bulbs for the running, clearance and license plate lights on a travel trailer. Only 4 of them lit up. You'd think that I have a 50-50 shot at having them right which would be 7 or 8 right. A moment of head scratching, then I remembered the polarity issue, swapped them around, and they all worked.
B00AMAFN2S|2|Bought a pair about a year ago. New to HID lights so I thought these would be fine. They are cheap, that's nice if you want cheap bulbs. They do light up. But they are NOT very good. They are rather dim. They also put out an ugly greenish hue. I know it's the bulbs not ballasts I have because my old bulbs were installed in the same ballasts and they were not green like this at all. If you want cheap HID bulbs just for the sake of having them, get them. (I should mention one bulb has burned out already. It is my low beam bulb but still.) I'm gonna look for higher quality bulbs.
B009MADRI6|5|As advertised.  With the direction of our country now, I feel it is important to be a positive testimony for Christ. Very nice quality.
B00UIDJ942|4|It is a much thinner cord than the OEM Sea-Doo cord.  After two months of use, it is starting to show signs of stretching out.  Both the metal and plastic clasp seem strong and have not been a problem.  We purchased this to replace a D.E.S.S. cable and were able to clip the D.E.S.S. module onto the metal clasp which keeps them together very well.<br /><br />You get what you pay for!!
B00CCSD6CW|1|Product seemed to be decent, but packaged horribly. The tint was so wrinkled on the roll that is was unusable.  This made it impossible to get the film to lay flat, let alone laying over a curved surface.
B005N53AR2|4|Love it! Rock n roll makeover for my car!
B004P5W66M|5|satisfied.
B006I24QAO|4|Good quality filters. Easier to take out than to put back in.
B000C2Y59I|4|The bend protection is hard plastic and I need to add tie wraps to keep it on
B00U1PE8C0|4|A+
B003SOKEXI|5|looks ,fit,works great
B000I2079E|3|Not nearly as effective as other penetrating liquids I've used.  Nowhere near the hype it has received.  Okay is the best I can give it.
B00OELXAD0|4|a bit cumbersome but did the trick
B002N2QTK8|5|Great:)
B0085IJXCU|5|Perfect match.
B00DDHC1YK|1|This does NOT fit my veloster turbo shifter! It won't let me shift into reverse.<br />Waste of money!!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Work as expected.
B00KMUDVA4|5|Everything as promised
B000765DMC|5|Excellent product and made in Eau Clarie, WI, USA!
B0031P6AIW|4|Made a little cheap, but are working for us.
B0012ZEZ8A|4|This kit works well.  I did the whole thing from washing to waxing and shining, even the wheels.  The only thing I don't care for is the bottle for cleaning head lights/plastics; I didn't see the difference. If there's an option to change that to leather spray for the kit, that would be great.
B0052XIR4Q|5|Accurate Description, Well Packed, Fast Delivery & Great Price
B0073WEZU4|5|easy to install, took 2 minutes. Much better looking and still retains normal signal strength
B00429NKWK|5|Works perfect,
B004QHP9A4|5|Product arrived on time and I was completely satisfied with it.
B003FBV8ZW|5|these were for my hubby and his new bike and he is happy with them and that's all i need
B00KN0UOEE|5|Unbelievable restoration of my bbq cover.
B003E26EV0|5|Have used the pads 3 of the last 5 brake jobs I have done.  They are smooth and quiet and long lasting.  The price is high but IMO these are the best pads you can buy short of &#34;performance&#34; pads.
B000CQOIVO|5|As described,
B00MVA7U3C|4|great product
B00IYO6OSG|5|Does the job
B0013V8GEC|5|Very useful.
B00N22TIEW|4|I installed but I had to purchase other clamps. The ones it comes with aren't good. You really can't fasten them well. We'll see how do they hold up.
B00029KC2K|5|Used on my 4 wheeler to re-cover old foil. Perfect amount for my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. Enough to cover all of the places that they had factory foil. Quick shipment. Good product.
B008S2A606|1|The pins are too short, therefore barely reaching the caliper foremen on the other side.
B00UBIMB0I|5|Best product I have used on my tires.  None better.  Last the longest
B007Y03YY8|5|My husband loves it.
B00S55F6RO|5|Switch is great . Nice and red
B00YY7M4AO|5|Bought it for a budding auto mechanic. He loves it!
B002RSIK4G|5|very sticky, works very well, no leaks, good product
B002P8QWSO|5|Worked great
B00L4J5UPQ|5|Easy install, great reception
B00KY5HB9O|5|Best bang for the buck
B00QQX0HXK|5|Pretty easy to install. Just a little tricky to get at a couple of the bolts. I left my stock screen on for extra protection and installed over it. Looks great. Great workmanship
B00029WSZ4|5|Excellent,really pleased with them.
B0019O1BS6|3|Although Amazon says it fits Honda civic coupe 2012, it doesn't and I have to return it.
B00JV0609A|5|Great fit and arrived when promised.
B004D4URV6|5|Transmission is now very smooth. Hope it lasts!
B003MO295A|5|Looks exactly like him!  My son loves it.
B000C55L3E|4|Good shock for my 2001<br />GMC 2500HD. Not to soft, yet still delivers a decent ride. Good price
B003SWNVI0|4|Read many reviews before decidin on this model so I felt I should also review to help others.  The most inconvient thing is it only zips off on 2 of the 4 sides so a corner can lift up.  We packed beach outdoor equipment in it so getting wet wasn't an issue on the way there but on the way home it oured and I eneded up having to put some laundry up there and it still didn't get wet and the flaps weren't even velcroed.  Just pay attention to how the unit should sit with the zipper facing the back.  We also do not have a cross bar so we ened up crossing 2 of the straps and then having 2 go from side to side.  Luckily my husband is good with knots so they stayed the 4 hour drive without a problem.  If you do no have excellent knotting skills I would just use a bungee or ratchet as this is why the tote stayed.  Once I figured out the laws of aerodynamics and put the boogy board on the bottom instead of the top, the noise and whisteling stopped.  Ocassionally a gust of wind made a noise on the tote but overall and exceelend job of standing up.  For all those reviewers who said it was shredded I think it was due to the 4 point system for the straps.  By crossing the straps we helped to hold down any extra material so it didn't flap in the wind so much and therefore was not shredded.  Good value.  I would definately recommend this to others.  Only bad thing was the 2 zippers as it made loading difficult.
B003UTH088|5|The remote is identical and works perfect on my 2007 GMC Yukon Denali. What a great price and easy to hook up.
B000CKJL1M|5|Thanks
B00O2FDSNU|2|Only for the smallest trailers, not sturdy enough for heavy or extended use. Nice and compact though!
B009XQ5W2S|5|Fast delivery and original part.<br />Very happy.
B00JRE38EA|5|Very bright. Put these in the smoked cab lights on my f250 and i know they can see me coming now.
B00SGTCWLC|3|It was a little flimsy and it doesn't stay in place very well.
B004AIJ0W2|5|Fits perfectly.  No issues with the cap that others have mentioned.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This is an awesome car shield from the sun.  it folds up nicely into the little pouch that it came with for easy storage under my seat, but it fills up the entire windshield for use during those hot sunny days.  The material seems very durable and it is has kept my car a lot cooler with just adding this.  Also, there is a black side to it, so I think if I put this on the opposite direction in the winter, it may help to warm up my car by absorbing all the sunlight.  That though I can't test out for another several months as it is too
B00HU93CEK|5|Found some bad markings on my chromed Harley pipe. Tried 3 very good quality chrome polishes.They didn't work. Disappointed I thought it was some type of acid marks or gouges in the chrome and was going to live with it. While at a friends I asked him what he thought caused it? He went to his locker and pulled out a bottle of this Collinite 850. In minutes he rubbed out these god awful marks. I was totally dumbfounded.Totally!! I immediately got on Amazon and low and behold, they have everything! Happy, Happy in Erie, Pa.  Damn, Damn, Damn............I'm still amazed!
B00852684M|5|6 lights (3 colors, 2 lights a piece) is great value
B000C3ZCLC|5|On-time and perfect fit.
B000CHHS92|5|works Great
B0066S2ROM|1|Part sh-erred in 15 months do not by this part unless you like working on your car unnecessarily. craftsmanship does not last. So disappointing.
B00H3ZYBZA|4|Works perfectly. Nice and bright in my Elantra
B00230MUJO|5|I have been using Emgo oil filters on motorcycles since 2001. At that time, members of my Suzuki forum did tests on available filters. Some of the brand name filters contained cardboard parts that leaked over time. Although the Emgo was the least expensive, the internals were tied with the best available. I only use Emgo. Don't buy these from Power Sports Superstore. They ship filters in an unpadded ENVELOPE, and they arrive all beat up and mangled. Taking a chance that gasket will seal.
B0024NO97Q|5|Had a mechanic install these lights. He was impressed with the quality and asked where he could find them.<br /><br />I got these for the UV resistance, which the OEM headlight lens lacked. It will be some time before I know how the UV resistance holds up, but so far it looks great.
B00RGQ1W7Q|5|comfy fits and works great
B0017OANWI|5|Exactly what I ordered and expected in performance.
B00B5ZY07I|4|It worked.  The caps on the otherhand didn't fit very well with my license plate frame.  Poor planning on my part.
B004A2WQPG|5|Good !!!
B00C5CN0CG|2|i could charge it all day and the battery life would run out fast. It also wasnt very loud. The range on the blue tooth was short too.
B0015FYQ90|1|Mirror was on vehicle for about 3 weeks, went out this morning the Allview and rear view mirrors where both laying on floor. I had to go to glass shop to have rear view mirror re glued to wind shield. Glass shop said things should not be hung on rear view mirror.. So buyer beware!
B00I0H26WU|5|OK
B004JB3EQ8|3|Seems quite a bit inferior to Aisin.  I installed it, and the bearings were leaking within a couple days.  I assume this was just a &#34;rare&#34; defective part, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars.  I replaced it with an Aisin, which worked perfectly.  If you compare the water pump design to Aisin, AC Delco is hollowed out in several places; it appears not nearly as sturdy.  Aisin is also the original equipment manufacturer for Toyota.
B000KK2DZU|5|Really great product, super easy to install!! Makes my 2000 chevy silverado tail gate drop like a 2015 GMC!! I love it will use this seller again!! thanks td
B00SBHXDV2|5|What I ordered fit just fine
B00JXYG7X8|2|The accumulator was a very tight fit, like the tolerances were just a bit too big. I had to file away the ridges in between the seals and use the spring from the old accumulator to install it. Ac blowing cold now with no leaks on compressor
B005G20GOC|5|Easy to replace old seals and new one works great.Much better /cheaper than having it replaced at dealer repair center. Took old toilet out ( and cleaned it!) , replaced seals and re-installed toilet in about 30 min.
B00H46KLNY|5|great job on mirror
B005UGIVIW|3|Didn't last long
B000CJYXDY|1|Chinese junk.  Left me sit 2 days after installation.
B001KSCEZA|3|Cheap fix, nice for the price. recommend buying a thicker double sided tape to install. Fogs quicker than the other mirrors on the car.
B004IV8NBU|1|How the hell does it add horsepower like it says in many reviews?
B0065UN8EO|4|This are nice quality plugs that should have all been pre-gaped. One was not gaped correctly. Maybe it was dropped because the plug's ground hook was pushed all the way up to the electrode. I would have given them 5 stars if it wasn't for the damaged plug which was easy to re-gap.
B00JDPQALG|5|Looks good and really turns heads.
B008S9CNLE|2|This helmet is way too thin for my taste. It fits well and was cheap. May do the job.
B00B9J21QW|4|Super easy install.  Product was packaged well.  Works great. The only issue was the leveling bulb came empty and was a little disappointed with that, but not the end of the world in my eyes.
B00ACXM8DW|5|95% of the reason you will consider this seat is to reduce the heat on your &#34;bottom&#34;. In combination with some heat shield tape lining the inside bottom of the seat pan.....the seat works nicely. The remaining 5% is because the factory seat is hard as a rock by comparison. It's true, you will be raised up on the seat by a few inches. This increased height will modify your riding position a bit. I can still support the bike safely when stopped. I'm happy with my purchase.
B00E16M1S8|3|Product worked fine for 9 months and then failed. Amazon provided a no hassle replacement it at no charge.
B0040CTUAA|5|good
B005BNG1U4|5|Love them!!!
B0002Z9N1K|5|Stainless tip from Dodge is $116 dollars, but doesn't have the Flowmaster  logo. It fit perfectly and looks great.
B002QAC66I|5|Excellent cord
B008LMNGA0|5|If you have a mischievous friend on a wheel chair, they will love this fun sticker! Great to cheer then up!
B001G7H4UA|4|It was pretty basic but did the job. Cable inside had to be hand rolled.
B001EOWR3Y|1|no directions on how this thing is supposed to be installed - looked on website and the installation bolt replaces my normal locking hitch pin and there is no security.
B008O0JKL8|4|It is more of a gray color in person but other than that it's a nice sticker.
B000CIY0U6|2|To many bad reviews to take a chance on it.
B000C2ALXM|5|I use Fel-pro professionally and have almost no failures.  Be sure to put RTV sealant at the seams where the cover and<br />back cover for the engine meet.  Don't put RTV sealant close to oil passage ports.<br /><br />Steve NV7V<br />Master ASE L1 A9<br />Precision Auto Experts<br />Orem, Utah
B000A09MCW|5|Perfect fit.
B003S2E4UE|1|The bond promised, was just not there. Very disappointed in this product.
B00E5OUOCQ|1|This shade is only good for small cars. Other than that it's so annoying.
B005MT439I|5|Works well, easy to apply and leaves a smooth shin on the surface.
B0083YDM00|5|absolutely love the look with this front grill..was never fond of the original one from toyota.....great look...
B000CD5QCC|5|arrived in timely manner and works as described
B004M3IQO8|5|This actually works very well, particularly with the whole Jet Black polish kit.  It does genuinely do what it claims.
B0015PN010|5|great tool, very solid
B00DBEOM56|1|Work great as parking lights and are very bright. Can't get them to work as turn signal lights even after installing resistors
B00466V9AY|4|good
B00M250FNI|5|Fit perfect on the guide poles.
B00ZGIIFCG|5|fit my 97 ram perfectly. extremely satisfied
B000GZEULE|5|fits and works perfect higher quality then i expected
B0009IR0PQ|4|Took most of a stain out.  Bought a used car that had a stained head liner, would have cost $700 to replace, spent a few bucks on this instead. I don't notice any staining unless I look really hard... I'm satisfied.
B000C91E9K|2|did not fit my car as specified  :( had to jimmy rig it. but other than that worked fine
B00REQVA34|5|Nice light, works great
B0071MFPYQ|1|I bought a full set of Sensen struts and strut mounts from another vendor (initials RA). These are the worst parts I have ever put on a car. I replaced the struts and mounts on my 1999 Toyota Avalon because they were noisy; the replacement Sensen parts made MORE NOISE than the original parts within TWO DAYS of installation. These struts aren't even good enough to put on a car you are going to sell immediately.<br /><br />The Sensen parts have a lifetime warranty, but the warranty is only valid for replacement with the same low quality part. Plus you get to deal with shipping and the labor to R&R the struts.
B009WDX1NE|5|Husband loves it!!
B00FZGXIWG|5|Fixed my leaky valve cover.
B00062ZIOU|5|The wax is a great product and came inna timely matter.....used this product before in the past,just couldn't find it anywhere.....very pleased with the wax....
B00O72Y2CE|5|Solved my issue in finding a proper jacking point on my 5th Generation Camaro.
B00HKJY1MC|1|what a piece of junk!! used 2 times and failed. i installed it and hooked to truck, took to camp site unhooked from truck. two months later tried to hook to truck and all it did was make a noise no movement!! was i pissed!! now amazon only has a 30 day return and that really piss me off too!! so i'm out 125$!! lesson learned when buying a Chinese product! i give this one a -4 stars!
B000JUT7RS|5|Night and day difference over the old points and condenser system. Also replaced my spark plugs when I installed this, so just gapped the new plugs per this on my '66 Ford F100. MPG improved too! Great product.
B0002U1TX0|1|Removal is a chore involving several aggressive passes. Maybe this works better with a powered buffer, but for hand wax this is the worst product I have ever used. In the garbage can it goes....
B00JG0531G|4|The set fits exactly as description, easy to install and good quality. I will recomend to buy this item to any one who ask.
B000PF1PFE|5|VERY GOOD
B00DLMGZ9O|5|Easy install. Fits and looks great
B00VX7CK4S|5|This hanging car trash bag can be used in a variety of way.  It has a nice waterproof lining, side mesh pockets, perfect for water bottles and an adjustable hanging strap.<br /><br />I like the fact that it can be hung around the headrest on the front of an empty passenger side seat to provide ready access for a driver.  It can easily be swung around to the back if passenger room is needed.  The hanging strap is adjustable so that the bag can be placed in exactly the right spot in a car.<br /><br />While it is designed to be a trash bag, I find it is more useful to me as an organizer.  I frequently have so many items on the passenger seat that something always seems to get knocked to the floor and impossible to retrieve while driving.  I love having this secure way of storing things right at hand.  The front of the bag has a cute logo of a car above the words, trash zilla.  I feel that the prominent logo gives me a way to conceal items in the car without tempting a break-in since it seems logical that the bag would only contain trash.<br /><br />Disclosure: A complimentary product was sent to me for trial and evaluation. I have no connection to the seller or the manufacturer and my review is based solely on my perception of the merits of the product.
B00A82A3RK|5|Great! I used this to replace my fried battery in my harbor freight 5-1 power pack. Works awesome!
B00FB3MT7S|5|I thought it would be a little bigger, even though I read from other reviews that it was fairly small. I put it on my back window on the top middle and it looks pretty nice. Really great sticker for the price it is.
B0067UD9TG|1|Does not meet Honda OEM specs.  The motor stud is larger at the base than allowed by this mount.  I didn't realize at first, and cross threaded the adjacent bolt.  Had to tap out the hole on the engine block, and drill out the mount holes to fit the stud.  What should have been a 30 min job turned into a few hours.  Do NOT buy this for a early 90's Honda Accord (mine is a 93).
B00BCRMAAS|1|CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!<br />Although these seat covers are attractive, they are poorly conducted, and began to come apart after only two days use.<br />We are sending them back and ordered a different set...hopefully better luck this time around.
B00LE61UA8|4|Overall I am very happy with the purchase. Use the fit chart to check for proper fit before purchasing. I am 5'11&#34;, 185lbs, and normally wear a L but in the case of this armor I ordered a 2XL. It arrived to the USA in a very reasonable time considering it was shipped from China. It fits well and is pretty comfortable; especially for riding my dual-sport around in the summer. The right shoulder zipper did break but both shoulder zippers really are not needed. I am giving it a four because the zipper in the front appears to be cheaply made. I wonder how long it will last. I may have my wife put a better zipper in and I would still have a great armored jacket at a bargain price.
B009AQMLMA|4|Product was smaller than I assumed
B001UFI984|5|High quality
B00WJ0GOQS|1|Cheap! Would never stay in with top down.
B0002MABGE|5|Great product and easy to assemble. I read a lot of reviews that stated it was more for a wagon but it fit my Honda Pilot perfectly.
B00L32LLPC|5|Purchased this for my 2014 Ram 3500 to protect my 5th wheel hitch from weathering and corrosion and it fits great. It came with instructions but installation was intuitive without them. So far it's holding up well to rain and light hail.
B00GMP33T2|4|GOOD
B0002UNON8|2|it shines but it doesn't take scratches away, used 100 cotton and did as instructed.
B007N6HHDW|5|Fits nicely on my Buick grand national.
B000AMLWH8|5|I really like this product! It left my car looking clean, without the greasy or oily look or feel of Amour-all. It was easy to work with, had a clean scent, and I won't have to worry about my dash drying or cracking in the future, as what happened with Amour-all in my other vehicles. And, you can't beat the price!!
B00EYV2PJU|3|Seem fine all light up well. Simple plastic battery pack, only thing when you add the batteries it makes a high pitch ringing sound some are louder then others and I don't really care for that.
B000YCDUVU|5|I own a 2012 Ford Escape Limited and these fit almost perfectly (despite what Amazon says).<br />The one flaw I did find concerned the driver/passenger seatbelt bolt, located just behind both seats near the floor - the plastic mold wasn't engineered to compensate for this so it sticks out a little. Nothing major of course, but thought I'd point it out. Kudos to WeatherTech for making a great product though; highly recommend.
B000S2VZ6S|5|Arrived on time and installed with ease. Fixed my issue. Hopefully wont need another but if I do I'd buy again.
B000C02WCW|4|Installed without issues on a 2011 Nissan Altima 3.5SR (along with Akebono ACT905 pads).  The coating has no issues after 2 months.  Make sure to keep the rubber hole-plug from the old rotor.
B007ED70YK|2|I bought this because it was tall -- hoping it was tall enough to stay under the sun visors at the top.  It barely meets that criteria for my Lexus.  Shockingly, it's not wide enough to cover the windshield horizontally.  It is well-made and looks durable, but I'm disappointed overall.
B0060HVCHW|5|I have tried/used every wax single product stores like Auto Zone and the big box stores sell and I keep coming back to Kit Wax, or as it is now known, Formula 1. Concerned that my favorite automotive wax had been chemically reconfigured I telephoned the manufacturer and was reassured by a company administrator that the only difference was the new name. Well, not quite - they did make that nice, easy to use, application sponge a lot smaller so that today it is about 1/3 the size it used to be. The new sponge is more difficult to use, does not hold up as well and feels cheap immediately causing me to think they had similarly altered the wax composition too. However, as far as the actual wax is concerned I have not found any difference in ease of application, polishing after it is dry which can take up to 30 minutes depending on temperature and humidity, the durability of the wax film, cleaning properties and even the scent between Kit Wax and Formula 1. For all intents and purposes as far as I can tell by actual use and from testimony via a corporate administrator, the Formula 1 product is identical to the former Kit Wax product, except for the much smaller application sponge included with the wax when you purchase the can, not the bottled product which does not include the application sponge. For our use in NW Ohio, I have found the wax to last about 3-4 weeks on our daily drivers that are garaged each night. But, this is predicated on how you wash the car too. Detergents might reduce or totally eliminate the wax film. So, I always wash the car using cold water only. This does appear to extend the life of the wax film and also helps to preserve the shininess of the clear coat. Because the car is frequently waxed, only after it has been cleaned, there really is no build up of dirt/grime etc. I wash the car once per week and because of the wax film, all accumulated grime is easily removed. Interestingly I have found that this product can make a Plexiglass windshield look like it's new, eliminating those accumulated blemishes form normal wear. On Plexiglass the Formula 1 wax makes them sparkle like new and does not distort or alter the clarity of the windshield in any way.  I demonstrated this on a friend's aircraft windshield and he was astonished how much sharper and clearer the windshield clarity was after the wax was hand buffed using a terry cloth towel, the same way I buff it on the car. I know almost everyone has their was product preference and how it is applied, etc. No argument there. This posting is just my opinion based on my personal use. Nothing more. And, I don't work for the company or have any association with it in any way. I am associated with a local university engineering college.
B000BUU5YU|5|This cord is nice. Lovin' it and the price was right too. The handles are great for grabbing onto the plugs
B000BXKYW0|5|We have been camping for eight years.  I have found that it helps to be prepared.
B003YJNH4K|5|This is a great product. I still use wheel chocks too but this makes my 5th wheel seem like its sitting on the ground and almost eliminates rocking. It feels more like a house now than a trailer.
B000C9MIYU|5|Great purchase
B00D9C2CDO|2|The bag was too big to fit in between the crossbars on my Chevy Equinox  but I was able to get around that minor problem.  I bought this carrier specifically because it is advertised as WATERPROOF but it is not.  Upon arriving at our destination after our 12 drive we had to spend the next couple of hours drying out the wet clothes in the frontmost suitcase.  On our return trip we put everything in large plastic trash bags.  The bags were wet but the contents inside were nice and dry.
B00NJRGD70|5|Wonderful bargain. This product is very easy to use and also folds up easily when not in use.
B00D3298A0|4|Protects my true car floor haha. They're really good to use and they have cut lines where you can cut them if you need to adjust them, but I didn't need them. Has them perfectly for all 4 seats (no middle seat in the back unfortunately) but great to use, durable!
B00KN0UOEE|5|Excellant
B000C91ETA|5|This is the whole pipe from cat all the way to muffler with the resonator.  Can't beat it.
B00VER7Z10|5|Definitely a high quality gasket. The stock one blew out within a few weeks of use, so I ordered this one. You can just tell that it will hold up when you put it in your hand and feel the weight of it. I would recommend getting this even if your exhaust gasket didn't blow out yet.
B004BGN0L0|4|With the Drought in CA. I just wanted to have my car clean and not waist water. This does the job. Very happy with the results.
B00G0ZORNK|5|Fit like a glove, 5 minute install
B001AVONK6|5|As expected. Second time ordered this item
B006STTIVY|3|It's average.
B00P2SYBJG|5|Was a little iffy on buying these but after seeing the lifetime warranty i figured why not. I must say def impressed. A neigh or had random misfires on his 97 f150 5.4. So we ordered these and immediately noticed no misfires and better mpg when on highway.
B00G8UNQQ6|5|Quality parts!
B007R4GQ5U|4|Very good
B000EJV5N8|4|It doesn't work anymore but I had it for over 4 years and it's helped me and many other people in need.  The tire inflator didn't seem to work though or maybe I just didn't use it properly.  The jump starter itself was pretty good.
B00E7G1NGI|5|Love it looks great
B005CHT4W6|5|I read several other  reviews, usually use Mobile 1. Product came highly recommended. I am sure it will do as it is supposed to do.
B007RHX1IW|5|Exactly what I needed, showed up on time. Worked perfectly.
B009DJRB8S|5|Great people great price great product
B00O9YII7A|4|A little hard to install since the rubber casing is not exact in fit for the gas and brake pedal, yet I made it work. Im enjoying them.
B00KTH2UEI|5|exact fitting
B009DK3SDE|1|received wrong part had to send back
B000O0JQSS|4|does what is to do
B00RVAOFYO|3|only complaint is how hot this knob gets.
B00I3E2558|5|Very nice matt's sharp look to them clean nicely keeps the shine and doesn't fade quality matt's.
B002306ZMM|5|Perfect fit!
B008VLVDII|1|Not really usable with carseats - the holes for seatbelts do not allow use of the LATCH system.
B00J1BZ6E4|5|Super nice quality for really well
B00BMRRXXW|4|Great quality connectors. I bought these because I was tired of switching between the spray nozzle and sprinkler. They work great and do not leak. The one thing I did not like about them is the lower flow you get with these. They have an internal ball check valve that stops flow when switching between connectors, which is nice, but does dampen the flow a bit. I do not recommend using these with certain types of sprinklers, but they work great for anything else.
B00XRYRP5E|4|Recieved my lights.  They did not come with instructions.  Pretty much figured out on own which lights went where.  I was very happy with the look the lights displayed.  Would of given a five star if they would of came with instructions of which light went where.
B001B0WZR4|5|Perfect, just what we needed, and for the right price! Super fast shipping and great product!
B003CKFP5K|5|I have used various batteries in my bikes and some of the discount brands have not lasted as long as I would have hoped.  Yuasa does make a good and dependable battery.  I will stick with them.
B007NLOZAU|5|Very fast shipping through Fred Beans! The coolant does its job.
B00V5BTCYI|5|fast shipping, great product
B001UGJPXQ|5|Excellent way of stabilizing your camper!!
B00KTIR7EK|5|Looks good and works well.
B0011CXBQ6|5|I have a lot of comments on my license plate
B0002YUQ4E|5|GREAT PRODUCT. Will keep on buying until I retire in 15yr.
B0073W3QW2|5|Installation instructions call for a 17/64 drill bit, which I didn't have. Used 1/4 inch drill bit and it worked fine. I installed the left side first and had a little bit of bow in the guard from the nextie deck. When I installed the right side I used a couple of c-clamps to hold the guard to the deck after I attached the first end even after slightly bending the guard to match the deck curvature. Still have a little gap between the guard on that side but neither side is more than 1/8 inch or so. The side I clamped may be 1/16 smaller gap than the side I didn't.<br /><br />In any case I'm glad I got the guard since I already had some scratches/rub marks in the deck where it rubbed up against my back patio and fence posts.
B001GJ9K8C|5|The first car wash I ever bought was this one. Since then I've purchased many different car washes from cheap to expensive on the price scale and of different brands. I purchased this wash again last week because there is none other like it. Leaves my car looking really clean. I have not been able to find another soap that leaves the car with as much shine as this one. Looks almost as if I just waxed the car and for the price it's unbeatable. Highly recommended!
B00SH1SN6C|5|My car was having some battery issues. Had to use it three times to jump my car. Only charged it when I first got it, haven't had to recharge it yet. Great product in a compact case.
B002ONTBMO|5|just what it was supposed to be
B008C0YFGK|2|comes off of the backing. Ordered a replacement and it was also coming off.
B00HYIKEKW|3|plastic
B000C9WJ3A|5|The dealer wanted $65 to replace this. Granted, the old one was pretty filthy, but I knew I could handle the job for much cheaper. I ordered from Amazon and had it two days later. Watched a 2 minute You Tube video, and had the filter installed in my wife's Accord in less than 90 seconds. Couldn't have been any easier. The quality of the filter actually seemed more robust than the old factory Honda one that I removed and the A/C runs much better now. Don't ever pay for the dealer to do this service for you, it is one of the easiest maintenance items you could ever do yourself.
B0006MRRP8|4|My pup chewed the old ones off, so I thought we would try these. We put some glue in them to help hold on.
B008LMOM9O|5|Great size, easy tom apply, now all my co-workers want one.
B007VR8C0U|5|satisfied
B00L2L8XAU|5|Good
B0032IH2TO|3|For the price these glasses are adequate. The fit is a little sloppy because of the looseness of the snap-on arms. Size wise the fit could be better. The small pointy nub on the end of the arms makes it a challenge to put the glasses on if you are already wearing your helmet. The photo-chromatic tint is not dark enough at all. If you have light sensitive eyes these are not a good stand in for a good pair of sunglasses. The foam face seal does not make a good wind tight seal on smaller heads. If the manufacturer made at least two different sizes of these glasses in small and large and used darker tint these would be much better glasses.
B00EAOIHMK|1|Didn't do a thing for freshening the air when we turn on the air conditioner in the car ...
B00RM26HH4|5|Very good quality!
B00JV1NALK|3|The turbo manifold flanges are pretty thick which is good but when I installed it the original nuts just barely got over a full nut of thread. I will re tighten after a few heat cycles. The sound is obviously very tuner-ish which is expected from a v6. It is a lot louder than I thought it would be when combined with a 4&#34; mbrp catback but that would mean more flow and less back pressure which would spool quicker.
B00QWD1ROM|5|Worked and functioned just fine.  Shipping as requested.
B002Q1INDM|4|Got this to use with my solar system in my RV. It works, so far...always so refreshing to have ice-cold or even frozen drinks and treats in a hot camper RV. Get it now. Highly recommended. It pulls about 5-6 amps on a 12 VDC circuit, and depending on the temp settings you choose, ot will run on and off to maintain the chosen temperature. Yes, ambient temperature is a big factor especially in the summer and inside a vehicle. I have installed mine in the coolest part of the RV, with vents for air circulation around the motor. So far so good. I keep it on with sun during the day and off at night unless it's fuller than half.<br /><br />1-star off because temperature reading on the display is not accurate. I have a temperature gun and the temps do vary by as much as 10 degrees. It may be because the temperature sensor is at the bottom of the fridge. If there were an array of sensors from top to bottom and the display showed the average, then that would be closer to accurate....but price would be inflated just for that. So if you understand 'cold' as a feeling, and don't care whay the number is, then get this for sure. If you're the OCD type or prefer super accurate temperature readings directly from the fridge, then you may want to look elsewhere. For me, cold is enough.
B004ZF39T0|5|Love this product easy install and great product
B00TEG0Z56|2|The adhesive is very cheap and falls off after a day.
B003VDX5D2|5|This ladder is great it took me an hr. to install, which wasn't long considering the modifications that I made. I took some advice from other users of this ladder like putting plastic bushings between the hinge mount. I also purchased stainless steel screws for the plate that mounts on the tailgate. I also took rustoleum paint and sprayed it into the legs to coat the inside, I used a straw to get it down the shaft. The unit doesn't rattle and is very sturdy, I am very pleased with this ladder, it eliminated my bad knee from acting up and no jumping down from the truck. I would recommend this ladder to all my friends and as a matter of fact I did.
B0027Z6CK8|3|Performs as expected
B00OBWOH02|5|Great fitment for my DRZ S converted to SM. Great quality and great price. Very happy with my purchase.
B001CQWM8E|5|Bought used..couple easy mods..Works great
B001T92M20|1|what a bunch of crap, these are not xenon they are yellow coated halogen lamps.<br />I honestly wish sellers would quit using terms like xenon and hid to describe halogen capsules be it yellow coated or blue coated.<br />The only xenon are HID's and they require a ballast.
B00Z2CXC24|4|Did the job. Easy to install.
B0002SA3P2|4|Ordered these to go with the &#34;Bestop 53818-15 Black Denim Halftop&#34;. The doors do not fit well. The top left corner of each door is not quite flush. But it gets the job done.
B00B1V9OUE|3|Face shield will not adjust to a comfortable position.
B00Q66F7G4|5|It's not a genuine KIA part, but a genuine Hyundai part.  However, it is known that both brands equip their cars with the same parts,  so you can feel confident you are getting the exact replacement for your KIA.
B00C0XA9JW|5|Worked great, it did take some time but that is normal with any modification. I would buy this product again
B000VU51C6|4|Great compact horn with a big sound, I installed the horn in my polaris ranger. For new installation would be nice to have wire a fuse holder and wire ends
B003BXMAX8|3|Quality not as good as I had hoped, but will do for it's intended purpose
B0057FK08A|4|Loved how quick it was to change and I loved the price. Jiffy lube wants $35 for it. Saved me some cash!!
B00BAZCVDS|1|These are not Xenon nor are they HID, quit labeling your product as such.<br />They don't even have the light output of HID, these are nothing more than blue filtered Halogen there is nothing special about them.<br />Junk
B00KN0UOEE|5|Been using this for years , can't beat it no streaks or hard work.
B00CTUCXEA|5|A+
B00C0XCHKG|5|👍🏻
B00LB9ZEIW|1|Mats didn't match product description or photo.  Was given as a gift so I was not able to return within the timeframe.
B00BTL7P5M|5|It worked perfectly, and about half the cost of going through RV shop.
B001CF3QU8|5|Just like it was supposed to be!
B0041DY10C|5|The first one ordered arrived damaged,  seller replaced at no charge.  The second one installed in minutes and works great.  I recommend this one over the cheapest one found on amazon,  I tried that one first and it was cheaply made and the motor did not operate.
B00E9BEA48|5|A perfect fit for my Escalade EXT - thank you !
B00KTHXJHK|1|Advertised to work with a 2003 Toyota Avalon and it does not.
B00NJOJ7ZI|1|Cheaply made button fell off on install poor quality
B007S3KIDQ|4|We lost this part of our landing gear on vacation when we ran over a tire on accidentally on the freeway, had this part shipped out to our destination by Amazon and it fit perfectly and works great.  We had a 24' 2014 Cougar 1/2 ton Series 5th Wheel.
B00WMK6Z46|5|Great product; has helped keep my car clean during this very rainy year.  Easy to clean - just pull them out and hose them off!
B009F463Z8|5|Bought for replacement on '03 350Z with factory spoiler. Arrived on fifth day from order date. All parts in the box: rod ends, brackets with screws and gaskets, shocks. You don't need to save anything from the original set on the car. Mine came with two business cards in the box with a link on the back for install tips and FAQs.<br />  This is an easy DIY. Just use the right tools - 10mm socket, 12mm open end wrench, 13mm socket, someone to help support the liftback.<br />What not to do!  I tried to cheat by removing the existing upper rod end with visegrip pliers, and a cut-off disc on a Dremel because I didn't have an open end 12 mm wrench, and didn't want to wait for the stores to open. Turned a 15 minute job into about 45 with lots of &#%$(&@^  for only the upper end of one side! Got the wrench and the other shock was changed out in under 10 minutes. Liftback works great now. Very good product, all parts are direct match replacements from good company.
B00OK59E3U|1|Applied the product and it fell off 2 hours later. Either the adhesive is old or the product is just poor quality or both. I did waste my time and it cost me an additional $200.00 in labor billing added to the material and expedited shipping $25.00.
B001G6443G|5|Fit perfectly in my 1995 E300 diesel Mercedes. Would order again, and was definitely comparable in quality to the thermostat it replaced.
B005RUPM1K|4|good replacement for original key.
B008E32NJ6|5|I had 2 of these go out in a week the 1st cost over $60 at a local parts store and these one cost me with 2day shipping only $16 and I went on a 1560 mile round trip after installing and work flawlessly and still continues to this day
B004HPSI6M|1|DOES NOT WORK WITH GARMIN GPS!!! PLUG IT IN AND THE GARMIN SAYS IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE... DO NOT BUY!!! (returns include shipping so you lose everything)
B00EQ021IE|5|I Love them worked out good
B00VB2OJLW|4|Inexpensive cover for my old (gen 4) Camaro. Fits and is what I expected.
B00KL7SFMM|2|Cheap plastic
B00QSLORI6|4|Direct replacement
B003XCHBE0|5|Shipping was a little slow but i bought this a little over a year ago for my mother and it's still completely on her car. Granted she doesn't wash it often but still. Rain and an unusual snow storm and a hot summer and it's still there. Pretty tough sticker.
B0015PN010|5|This thing is incredible. I've used it countless times and I really cannot imagine life working on cars without it. If you are doing any type of suspension work, you should have this essential too. It makes separating ball joints as easy as a snap. One time this tool had difficulty removing a lower ball-joint on a Honda accord. That thing was incredibly stuck in there. I was really pounding this tool hard with my air gun, and despite me being quite scared of the tool blowing up in my face from the extreme pressure, it held up just great. I got some propane heat on it and with this tool applied and the ball joint finally gave way. When the ball-joint finally gave way, some sparks flew off and I heard a popping noise equivalent to a small firework. That is a true story, and I could not imagine having done that job without this tool. It would have taken hours! I highly recommend this tool.
B0079QRRRM|4|This is an excellent backpack in general -- spacious, well-built, well-engineered -- but it has one glaring, almost spectacular design flaw.  As has been mentioned in many other reviews, the waist strap buckles on the side, making it nearly impossible to clip when wearing a riding jacket.  This makes me think that (a) nobody on the design team for this thing was a rider and/or (b) nobody tested it out before release.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever worn fitted motorcycle leathers knows that they are designed to work well *on* a bike, but range-of-motion is not their strong suit (pun intended).  So, putting the waist strap buckle way off to one side on an otherwise rigid backpack makes it borderline useless.  It's really too bad, because this pack is otherwise excellent in form, fit and finish.<br /><br />Overall, it's well worth the investment and works really well, but it does so in spite of this flaw.
B0081ZYPLG|5|good price on this hard to get item
B000EOR1I6|4|leaks
B000WK69US|5|Really liked it almost looked like airbrush.
B00OSTEED8|5|Great price, very bright and compact. Used for loading lights on a cargo trailer. Mounted inside the rear door.
B00PBNZS0I|3|its not direct fit
B0049MTGXM|4|Perfect fit. One central holder and one screw per each side is quite enough (3 supports); some models do have 2 screws at the muffler side, but this is solid as rock, so I see no benefit of the second screw on similar models at all.
B001PWFPRU|4|Why don't trucks come with this from the factory? This is a great idea. No more tailgate slamming down when you have to open it while your other hand is busy. I have had quite a bit of trouble with the cable pinching and getting caught between the piston and the edge of the tailgate. I tried wrapping electrical tape around the thingy on the cable to make it thicker and that helped, but it still gets caught sometimes. It is worth the hassle though. Having the tailgate lower softly is worth the inconvenience of having to mess with the cable every so often. I've gotten to the point where I'm OK with just letting the cable loop protrude from the seam, but that might not be acceptable to everyone. Overall a great idea, fairly well executed.
B0081ZYPFW|5|good product
B007S2OMU2|5|A little longer than my stock speedometer cable on a 1993 Kawasaki ninja 500. But it works great, no issues, would buy again.
B007VXD1WI|1|stop working in 3 month,having a hard time getting in contect with anyone to help with this.thats why i dont like to order things online.
B000XRHRZQ|5|These hubcaps are an excellent value and they look great. They are easy to install and fit securely. It dramatically increased the aesthetics of my Corolla.
B003YI1784|4|Great product. Really like them.Only issue was one front mat had only one anchor hole and car had two anchor.
B00LY81CAY|1|I don't normally write reviews. But I felt like I had to in this case. This does not have a mirror finish. This does not stretch. A piece of paper has more give then this. If you crease this product it will forever have a crease.
B00O83KLS6|5|Awesome product
B0046I9FSU|5|Worth buying it....I am just loving it.
B006B28896|5|These fit the rear caliper of the 2009 Vulcan 900 Custom.  I'm happy with their performance and they don't exhibit any brake fade as far as I can tell.  Writing this &#34;review&#34; since it took a little research to figure out what parts fit my bike.
B007MX5LT8|5|It's a good product for the price.
B005CLN5RW|5|Satisfied. Excellent.
B000B8N3GE|5|When I bought a new radiator on this site (Shepard all-aluminum) I cheaped out and used an off-brand from Auto Zone.  What a mistake.  It was dimensionally wrong, so I had a coolant leak.  These Stant caps are what the OEM's use.  Now I know why.
B004GCEBLW|5|Looks good!
B00UBIMGSK|4|It did not work as advertised
B00BL0M43E|5|Really like these, helps to avoid stepping in puddles in our dark driveway at night time; will certainly help with ice during the wintertime. Installation will require a little more than basic skills but wasn't too complicated; those with advanced skills could get both sides done within an hour, whereas basic skills may require 3-4 for both. Most time will be spent on the first side done, the other should take a fraction of the time. You will need to drill some holes through plastic, it is not a tool-less installation. The wiring you will be plugging into is already there, hidden behind the wheel cover -- these are plug-and-go, no splicing wires together.<br /><br />The lights will turn on when unlocking the car with your remote key and when the doors are opened. They will stay on for about 20-25 seconds after closing the doors. Once you lock the car with your remote key, they will shut off after about 2 seconds.
B00JXZIVOA|5|This compressor worked great for me. The shop quoted $1,000 to replace my bad compressor. I ordered this one from Amazon and had a mechanic who worked at home installed for me.  Total cost: $350. It worked so great ice cold feel like when you are outside in the winter. No problem with seller shipped on time as promised.
B00MOOPNXY|1|Spent about 4 hours installing the system on my Electra Glide. Once complete, I fired it up and everything worked and sounded great. The next day, I'm riding the bike home from work and the music starts cutting in and out, like there's a loose connection. I get home, take the fairing off again and check all the connections, All look good. Then I start moving wires around and I find something wrong with the power harness. If I wiggle it, the power cuts in and out. Visibly the harness looks OK, so I assume its an internal short or loose pin. I do not want to take the system off the bike to send it back, so I call Rockford Fosgate in hopes I can just purchase another power harness. The two people I spoke to did not seem interested in my problem and offered no help. I told them I would be willing to pay for the harness and the guy tells me they don't sell parts. Uh, what?? You manufacture the product! How can you not sell parts? I had a positive impression of Rockford Fosgate and have purchased many of their products, but if this is their idea of customer service, I'll take my business elsewhere. So now I'm stuck with a great sounding system that doesn't work properly due to some Chinese manufactured $2.00 power harness. Buyer beware. Also, I have scoured the internet looking for this harness to no avail.
B00ZUZ6YDC|5|My husband is a volunteer firefighter. I am always looking for things to help him out when he responds to wrecks and fires. Red Earth Naturals did a great job when they made this tool. The tool is designed to complete multiple jobs. It can bust a window out as well as cut seat belts. Overall, the tool is the perfect essential to bring ease to an already stressful situation. My husband used this tool to cut a person out of a vehicle. He really likes the tool and wants the whole department to get them. I received this item in exchange for my honest review.
B008SEJRJA|5|Good price and they fit fine and installed great in my 2003 BMW M3.
B002ZTK72U|4|Happy with, but a little problem with the controls being lose had to add a rubber washer for a tighter fit.
B005JU5YCU|5|I use the on my 2011 F-150 almost exclusively.  They work great and last 8-10 months in the Maryland climate.
B008ZOIJAG|1|They look cheaply made and very fake. the picture on the website does not look anything like it does in front of you.
B007TEL9FA|5|All I can say is LOVE IT!!!!! Looks great in my new ride!!
B005G82C8E|5|I love these sunshades and I have people ask me all the time where I got them!<br /><br />I sent in the make and model of my car and they sent what was supposed to fit. When I tried to install them they did not fit. Because they are so cool, we decided to see if they would fit in my boyfriend's car, and they did so we kept them. I emailed the company and asked if I could order two different sizes and they said yes, so I measured and then ordered an XS and a S and they fit great. My car is not common so it was understandable the sizes would be off. I had to account for the rear view mirror when measuring for mine.<br /><br />They are so handy! I honestly don't think I'll ever have a different sunshade for any car I own! Love, love, love!
B001N729FS|4|very well made and it works!
B004RZMCCI|5|They work great
B000CK5KYY|3|They look nice but thanks to Amazon's buggy car system they will fit a Toyota just fine...and not my 2004 Honda civic ex.<br />Lesson learned and shared. BE SURE TO CHECK FIT ON EVERYTHING. The also bought and other links do not check fit and you can end up buying the wrong thing. Amazon also neglected to put a link to give THEM seller feedback...go figure.
B00R59Z0SQ|5|So easy to install and the compant sent detailed instructions as well.

B000XBKNCQ|5|just what i needed
B000IZ3OH8|5|Hengst Filter made in USA. There's a gm tsb stating that the cap gasket ring is a lifetime part which should not be replaced with an aftermarket ring. Hence why there is no gasket ring. If you need a new oem one then buy the ac delco pf458g, which comes with new ring and cap
B001KQAAFS|5|so far so good!

B000C9TY8I|4|This filter was ordered for a neighbor whose vehicle I installed it into a few days ago. He said his vehicle drives better now.
B00P9R8O2U|5|It does about as well as you could expect something so simple to work.  I use it for my sim racing rig, when sitting in it for a while, the seat can get very hot, this thing does make it a bit more bearable, and the beads feel nice on my back.  Seems to be holding up fine as well.
B000VWHQJA|3|I wrote this review for a smaller metal can that I first got from Amazon: More convenient than the 32 oz. can I just used up. I slip a 20&#34; hose onto the spout, with another spout jammed in the other end of the hose so it can be applied in just the right spot. I recently removed a Ford 460 exhaust manifold without breaking a bolt or stud. I soaked the studs and nuts for over a week though. Afterwards I used a percussion procedure of my own that has worked since buying my first car in 1960; you jam on the tightest combination wrench that fits the nut and pound on the open end with a hammer until the thing breaks loose. I tried PB blaster on two nuts; it worked, but no better than Liquid Wrench. UPDATE: Found a puddle of oil on the work bench today when I picked this plastic jug up; sure enough the corner was cracked. I dumped it into the original 32 oz. can and tossed this horrible plastic container... and changed my rating from 5 star to 3 star.
B008GT1J2K|3|Thought I was getting a deal with buy the drain plug, gasket and pan together but the pan came with a drain plug already and have yet to receive the gasket. So now I have two plugs and no gasket. Pan feels solid waiting for gasket before I check fit.
B004P4TH4C|1|Didn't work out of the box Eastwood sent a new one  Had mine 3 years light use and every time I used it gave me trouble now it quit working
B00W2XE3O2|3|Very light weight and I had to replace the tape one  it would not stick. I would say they were what you paid for, did go on and fit ok. Look good.
B006LJ80C4|5|Fast shipping and good price!
B000Q0PG9E|5|FIX LEAK IN REAR  MANIFOLD NO MORE COOLANT LEAK ON 1996 K1500 5.7 SUBURBAN .OLD ONE WAS WARPED
B002UC18HU|4|It took me two days to get this thing installed! I first had to fight with the old one, it didn't what to come out. This thing has to be at a weird angle to make everything line up perfectly. Was not an easy install. It runs a little hotter than my old one did, but not a necessarily​ a bad thing, just a fact.
B00CPFD0DC|4|Would be 5 stars but I thought I was receiving the whole hitch, not just the attachment.
B005WG88KQ|5|Just wish the power cord was a bit longer but that's easily remedied with an extension. The valve grips very tightly on Schrader and can be difficult to get off causing loss of air. This will probably become easier as it loosens with use. Great pump!
B000V20XBS|5|Purchased a new car and just had to put my team on it!  Love this decal
B00BQS7UEO|1|Like many other parts for old VWs, these appear to be made in China.  That in itself isn't a problem, but for this part in particular, the quality is not there.  Unfortunately there are few other choices and none seem to be any better.  I bought this to replace another Uro coolant level sensor that had failed by allowing a small amount of coolant past the connection terminals.  The leakage was minor but causes a coolant smell and will eventually foul up the plug.  One day after installation, this sensor shows the same failure, a small amount of leakage past the terminals.  If you need it, you need it, but be aware that the quality is poor.
B003RYOWH8|4|Very simple, but fit well and seem to be holding up well so far
B00OU0SPWQ|5|I love this product. Really nice. All my friends love it and ordered some for them.
B008P0US7M|1|cheep and used
B00VF7HZF0|5|works good like it very much !
B00802FFA0|5|Nice product and packaging. Easy to install. Took about 30 minutes. Look greatand very bright and blue!
B00T0UNU4E|5|Good product. Very bright. Two pairs(4 lights) are at least as bright as my low beam headlights with a much wider field of view and just as far of projection. I did take them apart to add a yellow tint to the lens. I do not recommend this. The gasket behind the lens shrinks and was a pain to stretch back into place and I'm not sure how water tight they are anymore but I have not noticed any moisture inside the lens.
B00B8Z5P2E|4|Few minor dings that will need to be fixed  but overall looks pretty decent.
B003VDX5D2|4|very  good  ladder
B000E4PVD8|5|It went in and fits!
B009Z1KQ2M|5|These grips put out some heat.  They are too hot for me on the highest setting, unless its below freezing outside.  They seem like they are good quality and installed easily.
B00LLZFIK0|5|have not needed to use these as of yet, but feel better knowing they're there.
B000NUCPKK|5|Fits great and easy to install.
B007T9NMH8|5|Worked as advertised.  Quality tool.
B000XBDIZU|5|spark plugs!
B000C59YPU|5|Excellent product and great service. They were in the original box and just like the ones in the local parts store and at a better price.
B001NQIQAG|5|The Hubs Loved It :-)
B000F1Z6NA|3|A bit too light.  Expected a higher quality heavier product. Several weeks wait.
B00BTGDRB8|5|great kit for the money and an absolute must for a detail starter.  It is really handy since most compounds and swirl removers will have different results depending on the pad stiffness.
B00I03JE5G|1|Same problem as review above.  Broke at the point where it joins the thread, came our or socket.  Lucky that shaft did not puncture break line or penetrated the fuel tank.  For 7,000 pounds vehicle seem to be insufficient design or faulty materials
B007S8M0OG|5|Wish I had one of these years ago.  Never had much luck with the &#34;bar type, two wing nut&#34; flaring kits.  This got the job done in 10 minutes, no slipping and destroying the flare.  Used it on the vehicle on a line on the rear swing arm.  Works as described in tight places.
B00D393XYA|5|We haven't had a chance to attach it. But it sure came right away, couldn't believe how fast it came. It looks very nice and just what we wanted. Thank you
B0000AY2Z6|4|Not as powerful as I hoped.  I wired it into a golf cart and hoped that it would provide strong airflow to the driver and passenger, however the fan is just not strong enough.  It is well built, convenient to carry and quiet.
B007OXCIB0|5|Good stuff!
B005HAYDR4|5|These look great in the Jeep. Strong. Good quality.
B007Q7WC38|5|product as described. works well
B00V89ZVUG|3|I bought the 5000K set. I would describe the color as purplish. I'll keep them, but the color is not as advertised.
B00DPYAGVG|1|Took several weeks to arrive and when it got here the sticker was wrinkled and creased so badly it was impossible to apply.
B000CM3I9G|2|The mirror is cheap and the fit is terrible.  It was at least a 1/4&#34; smaller all around and did not fit into the opening well.  I made it work but it doesn't look good.
B004BWU8AA|4|Received on time! Fits our truck perfectly.
B000C2SB8O|4|The bend protection is hard plastic and I need to add tie wraps to keep it on
B004BWU8H8|4|Installing it was a bear. The 2012 Sahara seat is riveted on (no screws) so I had to cut off (thank you drummel) the metal arm off that supported the heated seat cables. Other than that the box does what it says.
B004304C0W|4|Came quickly and is as described.
B00UEMH5L6|4|Very easy to install. Hope the two-sided tape holds the wash :)
B007S0LDME|5|Great stuff. Easy to use and NO smell.
B00K1C1WC2|4|Simple and they work well
B003VP5D6W|3|did not work on my 2000 chevy Silverado because I have built in seat belts and they was not for my seats so I put them on my 93 Toyota camry so I used the any way.
B000SNBSMI|5|For the price... I wasn't expecting much. But upon opening and installing this cover I was very pleased and counted this purchase as one of those products that restores your faith in online shopping! I would have been this happy at twice the price.
B00AZ1X0E2|4|So far so good.  Installation was straightforward. (for the Trans shop I took it to!)  Haven't pushed the car through any tough sections, but overall the fluid temperature seems to be 10-15% lower than before installing.  Rarely &#62; 200F - which is good.
B00GKTZCPI|1|Just like the other reviews. I expected this decal with a transparent background.  It came with a white background, with faded paint.  Contacted the company with these concerns and was told that the picture in the ad was with a white background and I was wrong.  But the picture obviously has a clear background.  Very disappointed.
B00TQWUSFA|5|excellent product
B00I1ASC06|5|Worked as intended. Easy to install and rather fast. The light is much better than the factory bulbs.
B004LF140U|4|Had to make some adjustments to both the unit that this was going to be installed in and the replacement board.  The original inverter base was flat metal where this has an elevated plastic one.  After bending a few tabs and drilling holes to secure it, works just fine.
B007568DA6|5|Excellent
B001BAIYII|5|So far so good. I put these on back in May here it is August on one of the wettest summers around and so far they work great, and unlike the last pair if wipers I had these don't flop around in the wind.I am going to replace my wifes car wipers for these!
B002N5PR5S|2|Will not fit a 5/8&#34; hose (but says it will).<br />Screws are too short and stripped out.<br />Ended up using a Hose Clamp.
B00AFVRF8Y|5|works great.  Easy to install
B0007QGT34|4|Using it in my Dodge' differential.  Great product.
B0009IK4M2|4|It's a wiper blade, a rubber strip. What expectations?
B00D99T2VC|1|This are not what I wanted , not the style I need plus the sun roof visor is to long, not for my vehicle
B009UOPSOK|4|These LEDs works perfectly as described they are way brighter than the stock lighting and looks way better. They arrived on time with no problem. The only issue I had is with the 2011 accord coupe 2 of the bulbs do not fit anywhere. Other than that  perfect product.
B001DCH2ZA|5|Great!!
B000WKHVIM|5|Looks much better than stock, good quality anodizing.
B004I11DFI|5|Good quality. Fit fine.
B00MBI1CGA|1|I actually bought this from Auto Zone but I wanted to warn everybody. The fuel inlet stickes about 2.5 inches out of the bottom which makes you have to wedge it in instead of the OEM having the inlet on the inside. This pump is actually an 1.5 inches taller which made it so I was completely unable to put the retaining ring back on. Long story short this fuel pump does not fit 2004-2005 RX-8
B00LMRFJGK|5|Its a little big. Could be little smaller to go over the &#34;wrangler&#34; sticker. But can't complain or say anything bad about the actual sticker. I'll find a good home for it.
B000K12EA8|5|Worked like a charm.  I'm using it to host the top off my Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  We have a 14' garage ceiling.  I took about 5 hours to install, including paining the supporting 2x6 boards.
B00KTJ8FKY|2|Not too happy with these because only one of them worked all the way. The other one would lock and sound the alarm, but would not unlock. I had to use the key to unlock it which set of the alarm every time until I put the key in the ignition and started it. I had to make two trips to a mechanic to get them fixed and programmed correctly.
B001KS86VQ|5|Perfect fit! Don't even notice the difference.
B005LD2C98|4|Worked ... carb cleaner is carb cleaner.
B0079MOTOA|2|made in china a lot of filing and sanding
B00KTIYXLU|1|didn`t work. followed the instructions but no luck worked the last time I replaced the fobs
B004MU8VRS|4|The faucet fit well and was easy to install. It sure is a better replacement than what was there. It works exactly like it is supposed to.
B001FMBHRM|5|New product beats dealer any day.
B00AB2PBU6|5|Fits my 05 Tacoma just fine, great cover the price.
B00U2COE7G|5|WORKS!
B005PD64T8|3|Takes a lot of movement to get theses lights to turn on.
B00BJ7Z562|5|As promised. Look great!
B001CF4UXU|4|(July) Haven't had the opportunity to use it but appears to be well made. Very stiff when new but that will go away overtime.<br /><br />Update (Dec 24,2015)<br />We received 8-10 inches of snow in a matter of a few hours this morning. I was heading over to a friend house around noon right as the storm was letting up. The city has this habit of not plowing anything until the snow has cleared. I went down a 2 lane road with a sizable ditch on either side. I came across this new AWD Lexus sedan in the ditch and I decided to help. The tow strap did great. It is a little stiff but after putting it to use it straightened out and loosened up a bit. I don't have a clevis so I had to loop the strap through the front eyelet on her bumper and to my hitch. I pulled her car straight back into the road no issues. I would definitely getting at least 2 clevis so you don't ruin the strap.
B001N41U1A|4|Great product, but seems to be very overpriced. As other reviews have stated, plastic is fairly thin (to allow the seats to fold down). I think this should be priced more in the 40-75 dollar range rather than 100. It's taken a couple weeks for all of the creases to come out of the product after being shipped rolled-up. It does what it's supposed to and it's nice that it has a raised lip to keep liquids from spilling over into the trunk.
B005Y54OH6|4|Got them, will use later.
B00AN2L0TU|5|Love it. Fit perfectly and easy to install.
B001PTQJBY|5|First kit arrived but didn't work. Easy return/exchange and installed the new kit without issue. Looks great! I put these on my 2014 Shadow Spirit. The 12&#34; pieces under the gas tank, 6&#34; under the rear fender, one 5&#34; under the air intake, and the other 5&#34; on the bottom cross frame.
B0041Q9MEO|5|very satisfied
B005LU2XKY|1|ordered the correct part - it was DEFECTIVE when I installed it - BLS (seller) so far is not willing to refund the price - Say cannot replace b/c it is now out of stock - Contacting seller again to try to resolve and get a refund on this. Stay tuned.
B004ZK0W7M|5|Great.  Fit perfectly and works great and FAR cheaper than OEM.
B004J9FVTS|5|My hood lift arm had failed some time ago and I have a couple of those versatile 3 to 4 foot items around the house I had to use instead. This new hood lift is far more effective because I don't always have my 3 to 4 foot children with me!<br />This was well packaged and promptly delivered and easily installed in our Buick Enclave. Perfect!
B000C5DUEG|5|WORKS GREAT LITTLE SOLDERING BUT VERY HAPPY. I AM GLAD I CHECKED AMAZON FIRST.<br />  THE PRICE WAS GOOD.  HAPPY I GOT IT WORKING.<br />  GREG
B010K8VBDG|1|Tool didn't work. I paid 380$ but they refund me 280$. Overall..... Lost my time and my money.....
B00CQAR23A|5|The awning replacement  fit great.
B00826OVWW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B005ETESLY|1|A little over a year later and I'm replacing this alternator. Bosch is known to have good quality. I'm not sure what went wrong this time. However these items are too exspensive to have to replace yearly
B00CPPJ8LU|5|Looks and fits perfectly tailored to my xterra!
B000EZVXCK|5|works great and great value. I'm not running to the store so much with this size
B0082365AQ|5|Pretty easy to use. I didn't have too much trouble about the stinky wheels because I leave it outside, so it doesn't bother me.  Instructions would help but even without them it isn't hard to figure out. I'm happy considering I bought the cheapest one I could find. I didn't bother with the strap and went straight to using a bungee.
B0026OKUYO|3|Its ok, looks good however it didn't really work with my car.  Or maybe I couldn't figure out how to make it work.  I couldn't get it to fit tight.  It seemed a bit tall on the stick.  As I said it looks good, my issues could be installer issues.
B00JSSZBGS|4|Baker builds a quality product - however, this is for the transmission shaft NOT the front shifter, front shifter shaft spline is a little larger (on a FLHTCUI).  You will also need to chase the threads in the top part to connect to the linkage.  If you have a stripped shifter arm on the transmission, you will need to disassemble the primary to replace this lever [ the Better Lever is a quicker - cheaper alternative] . This is much stouter than the stock lever - but it is big job to swap it out just for the looks.
B00656YYS2|5|Made by Honda for Honda. Fits like a glove, and top quality!
B00RIIQV3M|4|lol I got these lights and the words tiwan were all over them Taiwan is not usa made but they look good and worked!!
B00LNLZHZI|5|It's amazing I luv it
B000WO8MKY|5|Great buy for my 93 Kawasaki ninja 500. Didn't even need to use adhesive, tight fit! Would buy again.
B00335D79U|5|Works great, had to remove grill to sandwich it in place.
B00SI6V30E|1|Ripped up on the first ride
B00A11K7DS|5|Great price
B000FQ7AI4|3|WHAT the hell, I bought one of these last year or 2 ago, 18.00 bucks.  You do know the price you have listed must be wrong. WHO in their right mind would give you over 100 bucks for this  hahahaha  get real
B00OI0DEVK|1|Nice looking plate quality except for a bend crease from shipping I am assuming.
B00KTHXJHK|5|5 stars, item works great on 2005 Toyota Sienna LE and was manually able to program the key.
B0012LCX5Q|5|keeps the motor clear after a day of running through the dirt.
B000SKV4U2|5|Excellent product
B000KYT2AU|5|GOOD
B00BRL73Z6|5|Perfect fit for my 2011 Camry!  The darker gray is a perfect match for the gray of the car, so don't hesitate to get these if you need mats.
B00861LUWC|5|Good feeling from 1000rpm to red zone, I love it.
B001GH1PU0|4|Nice looking Switch for the Jeep.
B00R6S0MEI|5|Heavy duty nozzle.  Appears to be made of brass.  My old hose nozzle fused to my hose end due to galvanic corrosion because it was made of aluminum.  I shouldn't have that problem with this nozzle.
B00BTLEHSK|5|They are what to be expected for the price. good
B000E7DMU4|5|I got this to match my car color and help keep filter clean. So far sogood. Awesome seller got item super quick!!!
B000HS4QA0|5|Great grips.
B000BUU5VS|5|works great
B007KTINWQ|5|awesome
B002XL2IEA|5|works as described
B002UC6RUS|5|Does what its supposed to do.  Tok 30 seconds to replace, and seems just as good as the original door bumper did.
B008Z3W06G|5|Was exactly what I wanted
B000C492CG|5|Works great fit perfectly
B000BUQODG|5|Easy install, and love that I can have my vent open while driving and during terrible rain storms.  Came in handy through some bad storms already.
B005CLMWYO|5|Worked perfectly for my needs (2001 Ford Explorer). I had to change out my OEM handle about 5 years ago and the replacement handle failed recently.This was a great economical replacement handle and I expect it to last until I trade this vehicle in.  I would suggest going to youtube and find a video by 1A Auto (9:32 long). They do a very good job of showing you how to replace the handle.  Once inside of the door, make sure the window is UP when you are removing the window track bolt. This will help you move the track around as needed. Good luck!
B007KFMI9Y|5|Excellent price, great quality rotors & pads! Great Job Amazon! Better than the auto parts stores on line!
B00EJA3E1Y|3|Not quite the same tan color as my 2001 Silverado....but way better than the old cracked one.
B000630IPI|1|cap does not seat on the cap properly and therefore the rotor button does not hit the electrode correctly.<br /><br /> Proform 66993 Electronic Conversion Distributor Kit
B0022ZS2SI|5|A great product I will order more soon for project  my vintage go karts thank you!!!!!!!
B0017LWB8A|5|High quality SS band clamp providing a flawless seal.
B00684TAYY|5|Good easy to actived
B009DJQF08|2|Would have worked fine, just too short
B004A0WEAA|5|Great, perfect  is the best .
B0006IX87S|5|Works like a charm
B0054YCW62|5|this is great. used many times to secure a load in my pickup bed. i would like another with smaller holes. thats what she said.
B00PU7WHMM|5|good
B000CGHQW2|5|Great would reccommend
B00EPDLRKA|5|High quality and looks great on my 4-Runner!
B0041CDPQO|3|Works great
B008G3KCHE|5|My lights fit perfectly on my 97 ram. Very affordable
B000CAINEI|5|Definitely worth the price, very useful.
B00ET990WW|4|It does what it's supposed to do and helps when hooking up to our new 2015 Ford pick-up which has a deeper box than our older truck.
B000C3F316|5|Perfect fit and easy install. Installed a new water pump on my 86 ford ranger.  With a 2.9 L V6.  This was a simple install for a properly completed job. I also installed new belts and hoses. .  The fan clutch wears at a similar rate as the water pump.  It's a good idea to change it out at the same time  My last one was 10 years old.  I expect the same life out of this on.  High quality part.
B001GC2LVM|3|This was to long we had to cut it to go between the wheels
B00JVJ444O|1|came bent and had air bubbles everywhere
B001F0IE7A|4|Fairly easy install. Would rate a 5 but there was a little slop not a true 3x3&#34; therefore had to tighten bolts beyond the recommended torque setting. Also says 3/4&#34; wrench needed, but makes no mention of needing a larger wrench or and adjustable one for hinge bolt which is a 1&#34; bolt. Overall I am satisfied. I would recommend getting the welded version. Drilling 1/2&#34; bolt holes through steel is not any fun.
B0016C3SZK|5|Nice
B0041CG55W|1|I ordered this for my 2004 sportster and it did not fit.
B00UVYL7U2|1|Don't let the images fool you.  The AMG logo is just a sticker.  A very bad one at that.  Improperly placed, with air bubbles that are very visible.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great!
B00IFHNEYO|5|works like a new battery should
B003TTX6FU|5|Great product. VP should just sell all of them with the spouts.
B004RROBT8|5|Great battery that arrived quickly and does exactly what is should for a honda scooter.  fit great and came fully charged.  Half the price of local stores, great battery!!!
B0024E6V30|5|Great bargain - I was buying mine from WalMart but the price for these makes it VERY affordable.
B000O825LK|5|Works as expected
B004WZ90GE|5|I bought this brand for my wife's Subaru Outback and loved them so much that I'm buying a set for my Envoy.  These are the best quality that I've seen to date, as they are more sturdy than most and don't look cheap.
B000CN91NW|5|Buy two and connect them together for an adjustable throttle rod.
B003RATDHQ|5|Works wonderfully, the DIY guide to programming was super easy to understand too. Took me less than a minute to program. Also shipping was super fast. I highly recommend this product to anyone.
B00KTIYXLU|5|saved a lot of money. good used quality
B002GO93I8|5|Perfect fit, took less than 30 min. to install.
B00E6A9IMG|5|Obsessed!
B00YVHGTBM|5|It worked great with my 2013 Audi A5. Very easy to customize with a good variety of options. Great customer service. Waiting for the next update!
B00XIY8NNQ|5|Perfect product! Fit great, very easy to install and soooooo much better than the open/empty cavern that was between the seats before. Don't get me wrong, I love the size of the storage of the center console and storage in the 2015 F150 but this organizer makes it actually usable. The OEM sliding tray still fits/works great as well. Highly recommend this organizer!!
B0027XK7OW|5|Excellent fit and super easy to install.  Quick and easy fix after a really bad hail storm!
B0067DNYVG|5|Outstanding!  I bought a 4XL, and normally wear a 46 XS suit jacket.  I've received lots of compliments on this vest.
B00SGUCP68|2|Not as large as I was led to believe.
B001U4Z73A|5|as advertised
B000F13I2G|5|fit absolutely perfectly in every way on 2003 chevy trailblazer. Color true to picture.
B005SEJTUA|5|I put this in BMW 745-I. Royal purple makes one of the best oil's there is. I will run this for about 10 K miles.
B009JXVKOO|5|Good product. Solved my problem with flashing head lights. Quick shipping.
B00P9EJGR0|5|&#34;I just put them in my car and so far I am happy with them!  I like the fit and I like the way they look. I am hoping they continue to work well for us. I was very pleased to receive an email from the manufacturer after I placed the order, but before I received the item. I felt like they cared about my satisfaction!  So far, I would definitely recommend this product to others!!
B002K66FYW|1|The bulbs appear to be of a decent build quality, better than the cheap eBay ones. However, I purchased the 4300k bulbs that are supposed to be OEM white. I've only used them for one day so far, but the color temperature appears to be closer to 5000-6000k when compared to a Philips 4300k. It's more on the blue side. Perhaps after several hours of break-in it will whiten up? We'll see. Fair price, we'll see how they hold up.  Update: these are garbage  I don't know why the reviews are so good. I didn't even get ONE DAY use out of it. Disappointed.
B008THQ7S0|5|Great deal, two filters fe price of One from a dealer and they are genuine HD filters.
B00B9FEN9E|5|I am very pleased and will indeed tell other's about these keyless Remote offers.
B00843V9G4|5|Relatively light and comfortable, looks great.
B00LWKO7C4|5|I love this product they turned out great and so bright to
B0043FCNTO|5|Perfect Part
B000J3ZS96|5|Fits perfectly! Can't say enough good things about Coverking. Also got their front and rear seat covers, that are just amazing! I prefer them to the factory seats! Only complaint is that my sunshade got a crease in the middle from putting it up one time, but that's just me being picky over a cosmetic detail. In functionality, this performs AT LEAST as good as any other sunshade, and probably better. With 30% tint on the front widows and 20% on the back 3, I can put this thing up, let my car take 5-6 hours of Fresno, CA summer beating (often 100+ degrees), and not feel like I'm getting into a volcano pit. But on top of that, it fits the windshield perfectly, rolls up conveniently, and looks great when deployed across your dash. Save yourself from the hot sun, and save your dash from fading, cracking, etc. Invest in one of these!
B00390ME0M|3|***Update April 11th, 2017<br />Noticed while changing oil that there is a significant &#34;ring&#34; of fluid slung around my double cardan joint at the SYE yoke. Seems this seal is now letting fluid down the splines and the spinning yoke is tossing it everywhere. Glad I got a couple while I did. Lost two stars.<br /><br />***Original August 10th, 2015 review<br />Got a couple of these to reseal my slip yoke eliminator kit on my '00 Jeep Cherokee. The original seal on the output shaft leaked horribly (the shop didn't catch it...) so I had to pull the seal and you ALWAYS want to replace this little washer. I put a little bit of black RTV on it to hold it as I walked the yoke down with a socket; helps keep it from tearing.
B003ZWHJV8|1|Junk.  Broke after 1 week
B002ZS4QCS|5|These are great at keeping my purse and laptop bag from falling out of my seat. I wish I would have thought of it. :-) I have one facing back for the garbage bag and one facing from for my purse and such.
B00KZCALVQ|5|It's super bright and got here really fast!

B000C9Q2UG|1|Quality not good.  Made in mexico.
B007OW6LSC|3|the filter does fit and it works
B00JH23KVS|5|I've had this in my bike for about a month now. Fires up immediately every time. I had thought there were some issues with my bike that must have been related to an under-performing battery because since this has been in the bike is running much smoother. Very pleased with this battery and when I need a new battery for this or another bike I will be purchasing this product again.
B00ZR7WT5U|4|We purchased these for our rv thst is on a perManent. Site. Easily installed, nice lighting. Only complaint is that a white plate looked like it had yellow stripes from the lights. The old lights got hot and the covers had bubbles. These are much better.
B004VPX1TM|5|Perfect and practical, a light that's their if you need it. As always I only buy from Fowler Volkswagen.
B00B9W4HLQ|4|Good cleaner just don't rub to hard.  I found it left a lot of the original color of the Leather on my cleaning towel.  It didn't take the color completely out, but was a little concerned with what I saw.  That's why always use on inconspicuous place first
B007J7G1TG|5|I bought these a year ago for my crown vic. I didn't get them put in until probably a month or 2 later but I have put about 20,000 miles on my car since installing and they have worked flawlessly. I have seen better starting, no hesitation, and smoother acceleration since putting them in and almost a year later, they still work like they were just installed.

B00YHJ4BAK|4|the product was what was expected . It did however, take quite a while to get it.
B002MO7MQW|5|Rear right outer tail light was as advertised.  It was the exact OEM replacement outer right tail light  for my 2007 VW Rabbit and installed relatively easily for a VW.
B00498YH62|4|They work great and are sooooo  much better than the stock items.  Very good item.
B0022ZXO40|4|i love it! its strong and keeps good storage.
B007K9D7NG|4|I had a bed extender that was just that, a bed extender only. Pretty simple and easy to use, but not as sturdy as this Extreme Max. Still used it for years till it got stolen. I wanted to buy something better that also served as ramps since I have 2 motorcycles. Planned to use the ramps for break downs and not transport. So far thankfully I've not had to use this Extreme Max for break downs as my motorcycles have not left me stranded. I have a 4x4 truck so it still may not work well for ramps since my truck is a bit high and will make loading the motorcycles difficult. Still hope to find the ramp function useful some day. As far as an extender I've used it a couple of times. I find the strap system takes more time to secure and don't like that as much, but that may change as I use it more. So far it seems pretty strong and well built. I did one MOD that I found useful. I kept finding it annoying that every time I went to pick it up it would come apart. I bought 2 extra long bolts with lock washers and nuts to secure the extender so It no longer comes apart when you go to pick it up.  So if the next version has some kind of latch system to lock the 2 ramps that would be good and add an easier system to secure the extender to the truck tailgate. Hope this help. Overall I'm glad I bought it so far.
B00BITLNAS|5|Quick delivery, part fits perfectly.
B000C13UDG|5|The window regulator is solid and well built.  To ensure that this will work properly and not bind up in your door upon installation, I found that you need to do a little work to this new Dorman regulator.  First, stand up both your old regulator and the new one so that you can see the contour, curvatures and bending of the old versus the new regulator arms.  Remove the long and short black channel slides from their ball and socket couplings, and using a bench vise and a rubber mallet, form the new Dorman regulator arms to match the contours and bends of the old original OEM regulator. Try to match the spacing between arms and angles of the arms as best as you can to the original.  Pop back on the two black channels and you should be OK to install.  Don't forget to lube and install the rear rail channel guide clip on the end of the long black channel.  To prevent problems and issues, I always take digital pictures on dismantling and installing.  Reviewing the graphic record can help a great deal.
B00651C998|5|Adds a nice touch to the trucks appearance (2012 Tundra).  I don't use the FM radio too often - 99% XM. So the purchase was mainly for cosmetics.

B000CIV4O6|5|Great price
B00B5N2L6W|1|they are so flimsy,would not recommend to any one
B000MX2ORM|4|Shipping was fast, but the battery was not an exact for for my '05 Yamaha Venture. It was taller than the one I was replacing and my power cables barely stretched across the top to reach. I could not use either set of bolts as the one meant for top use was too short, and the side bolt was too long. Trip to the hardware store solved that, but inconvenient nonetheless.
B00H3QJ5PA|5|Knobby knife works great very good tool ,thanks ,roy.
B00979OEQQ|1|I purchased these on crapmazon in extra large in and I don't have big hands these are so tight they will more than likely rip within a week take my advice go to a store so you can touch and see what you're going to get. Yeah it is again crapmazon let me down 😕

B009KTAZF2|5|Works as described. Expectations were met.
B000C5SG86|5|Actually better than the OEM I took out. Works great.
B00ECWFGYW|3|The instructions could have been a little more specific as to which bar was which. For the box I received, the drivers' side hardware & bar were in green bubble wrap/plastic, while the passenger's side was in clear bubble wrap/plastic. I've dinged the product a star for this.<br /><br />The mounting brackets are also stamped with DX or PX, indicated (D)river or (P)assenger side. Where X = position.<br /><br />One of my step bars arrived slightly dented. I decided not to do anything about it as the hassle would be more trouble than it was worth to me, considering that the truck has 140k on it, and these bars are just going to get hit by road debris and feet for their entire service lives. This is where the 2nd star was lost.<br /><br />Otherwise, installation was quick enough. My mount holes still had the plugs in, so it was simply a matter of pushing the center cap in, and removing the whole plug. Definitely be sure to NOT tighten everything up for a side until you've got the three mounting brackets and the bar in place. The brackets need to move a little bit to meet up with the bar. Once you have the bar bolted on with hand-tightened bolts, push it back and forth a couple times to get things to settle, THEN tighten the bolts on the underside of the body, alternating between each of the three to get things seated nicely. Do the same thing with the bar once that's done.<br /><br />I'd recommend against using any kind of impact wrench on these bolts. I thought about it. I had one ready to go, but I decided to tighten things up to &#34;solid, by hand&#34; tightness with my ratchet. I didn't want to strip anything out. I feel like the bars are mounted sturdily enough for every day use, but having a 4th mounting bracket would just make them feel that much more solid.
B007JMTS14|5|Well made, Simple science it works.
B00K56PUJ0|5|Cute for my granddaughter who loves penguins !
B00N2T7216|4|cute wyw..that you can see from the inside when the sun shines through
B00K56K1W6|4|Quick delivery, easy install. Have to wait and see how well they hold
B00D1CQVIY|4|Seems fine so far.  I did have to splice in some wire to add length for the black line to the switch inside the cab of my JK.  I also added an inline fuse from switch to battery as suggested.  Why it didn't just come with the extra inline fuse I don't know.  That was the reason for giving it 4 stars.
B004AQU3WA|5|Exactly as described. Fast Shipping. Thank you!
B000C9RQ5G|5|Genuine Delco/GM, great price
B00KRHPHAE|5|I have had these for several months and they are still on. Make sure u check the size of your centercaps because they were too small to fill the whole circle. We just painted the circle and stuck them over the paint. They look awesome.
B000WJCSCM|4|great product
B000JZFV8C|5|Gives the truck a nice mean growl when you punch the gas, noticeable increase in the throttle response.
B000HAB7B4|5|Like other.. My tool box covers the Corner anchor location in the bed of my truck so I purchase this style ones.  They works very well.  I applied a lot of shear loads on them and they remained tight..
B002P8EMRW|1|Very poor quality.  Material is very thin and cap &#34;dome&#34; pops right off after several weeks use.  Cap also does not completely cover threaded valve stem shank, leaving threads exposed to elements and corrosion.
B000BUQODG|5|very satisfied
B00ADPHD02|5|Hesitation and shuddering stopped on first oil change and first tank of diesel.  I'm sold on this product and will use on every oil change.<br />2006 F-350 6.0 diesel!!
B002VJ7HWM|3|These shocks did not work on my 2001 Lincoln Navigator, but this was my own stupidity!  I did not catch that they were specifically for the Lincoln Navigators with the &#34;stock&#34; air ride suspension.  I had removed the air ride, and replaced it with an aftermarket coil spring conversion kit several years ago.  Evidentially the conversion kit made the ride height the same as the Ford Expedition, which made these new shocks approx. 3&#34; to short on extended travel.  This has caused the rear end to hop as you come to a stop, due to the shocks running out of travel.  I have since ordered the G63717 Ultra Gas Shocks, which I'm hopeful will correct the situation!  So just beware if you have done away with your air ride system.
B003S62WNG|4|It came on time , it did what it was intended to do ,it fit right in , it hasn't been long so I can't rate long term performance .
B000NF1SBC|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00JSJMV38|1|The best thing I had ever seen at amazon. A quality reall leather.

B000LNS47W|5|I bought this to touch up a Peg Perego John Deere plastic tractor and it was spot on to the original John Deere green.  Excellent product for a good price!
B00062ZIOU|3|I've used similar products in the past with better results. It will cover very fine scratches and swirl marks but not much else.
B0000BYEXO|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00E9I97QC|2|they did not fit and i had to install them with only one of the two screws the were provided.
B000VEKRTE|5|PERFECT FIT
B0028SHNMU|5|Smells like leather.
B00IRVF3DS|5|Great for drying. Use it for a swim towel and travel drying towel. Compact and very absorbent. Larger than sports towel of similar material and more absorbent.
B00CZEZNGU|5|Works well.
B000IY7ABK|5|love the brake pads.. way better than Honda brake pads..
B003VLBPJA|5|Extremely happy with this purchase. Got many compliments.
B000JFHNG0|1|What a disappointment. Received in June as a Father's Day gift from my brother. Used two times and high side gauge blew out and refrigerant blows out of the gauge when it is hooked up. Worse than China Freight product IMO. I sure hope Amazon has some kind of guarantee on these! Definitely NOT up to Amazon's standards and I sure hope they stand by the customers who are stuck with them rather than just quit selling them!
B001V8U12M|3|The shaft that fits into the  drill is very short
B00DMTTSIQ|5|Fits great, works awesome, I have had them for over a month, and really helps keep the interior clean, great investment
B0093A83KW|5|Works great. It keeps my car cool so I don't have to wait long for the interior to cool down. I would recommend this sun shade for anyone who wants to keep the car cool.
B0089LR0T6|5|Got a Honda? Use this - nothing else works better.
B012CKJBN2|4|In my area light bars are the latest and greatest thing to add to your truck or off road vehicle.  Since I have an old &#34;project&#34; Yukon and I was offered this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review I decided to buy one and try it out.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I got this item is that it comes with no instructions whatsoever.  All the was in the box was a well packaged light bar, a small box of mounting hardware, and that's it.  Since I've installed another, smaller light bar in the past that wasn't a huge issue but the lack of instructions is either an honest mistake and someone left them out of the box or the manufacturer makes the assumption you know what to do with everything.  Obviously some people are more mechanically inclined than others but as far as I'm concerned anything electrical should always come with at least basic instructions.  Something like a diagram for mapping your mounting location would also be a huge help since you are going to be drilling holes into your vehicle.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is how nice the look, feel, and build quality seems to be on this light bar.  The entire framework is made of aluminum and the curve is even and looks much better than the straight light bars of this size that I've seen around.  Even the front of the light bar has nicely polished accents to make it look nicer than just a big panel of lights.  After mounting it I can also say that it sits much closer to the roof line of my vehicle than the others I've seen and this 52&#34; size is really a perfect fit for my use.  Anything smaller would have looked out of place, anything bigger would have caused mounting issues.<br /><br />Some positive things include-<br /><br />Mounting hardware is included and comes with rubber pieces that help keep water from getting under the brackets and causing leaks.<br />Simple 2 wire hook up.<br />Combination spot/flood built into the same light bar.<br />VERY bright.<br /><br />Some not so positive things include-<br /><br />No instructions.<br />Included mounting bolts were too short for my application and were replaced with bolts from the local hardware store.<br />Wiring leads are fairly short, you'll need extra wire to complete the install no matter where you mount it, except maybe a front bumper.<br />Sometimes emits a high frequency &#34;whine&#34;, which I've been told is very common with larger light bars.  Not enough to be bothersome while in the vehicle.<br />Doesn't include a switch to wire it up.<br /><br />Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  There are a few minor things that could be improved on but for the money you'd be hard pressed to find anything close to the value of this item.  I've included pictures of both mounting brackets, some close ups of the spot and flood sections of the light bar, and some overall views of the light bar when installed and turned on.  I had also taken some video but Amazon is having trouble with it.  I'll add it later if possible.me not so positive things include-<br /><br />No instructions.<br />Included mounting bolts were too short for my application and were replaced with bolts from the local hardware store.<br />Wiring leads are fairly short, you'll need extra wire to complete the install no matter where you mount it, except maybe a front bumper.<br />Sometimes emits a high frequency &#34;whine&#34;, which I've been told is very common with larger light bars.

B00PP79NAQ|4|Better than the stock easy
B0006IX87S|5|seems to work great
B0029TQDLA|4|these cards last a long time but this is my second set. they do crack in the heat and break. but other wise serve the purpose.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|I love it and was shipped fast.
B0035U52KA|5|These fit the front caliper of the 2009 Vulcan 900 Custom.  I'm happy with their performance and they don't exhibit any brake fade as far as I can tell.  Writing this &#34;review&#34; since it took a little research to figure out what parts fit my bike.
B000HBNWOI|5|Great speed and strength, do not think my rearview mirror is going anywhere anytime soon.
B002IM0WO2|1|This does not have the 45th anniversary emblem/logo as shown, it is the regular mustang pony, also even at that the ink for writing and logo isn't very crisp it runs
B0009F9UZM|5|Works perfect.  Easy plug in and done.
B000FQ7L92|4|Would be 5-star rating if it could be used in both horizontal and vertical orientation.
B00PYLFM4O|5|I works. a bit pricey
B00O29G5NG|5|BETTER LATE THAN NEVER. Finally this item, red jumbo sunshade  showed on my doorstep just now(8/10) It was supposed to be delivered on the 7th. Personally, I found this very helpful.It is thick and the quality is very good. I have 3 red and 1 blue. I use them alternately. I am giving 2 red  to MY STAFF. It is jumbo size so it covers the entire windshield of my car.It is very nice and very different from the rest. I got lots of compliment. Modesty aside, I am driving a RANGE ROVER SPORT HSE &#34;young model&#34;. I broke the monotonous boring silver color sunshade in the parking lot. I HAVE MY OWN PARKING SPACE with MY RANGE ROVER , with the red or blue sunshade. How awesome is that !!! BTW, This is the item that tons of people got involved to track it down.To STEPHANIE a STAFF from AMAZON, state of Virginia, thank you for at least helping me.
B006N9HUGE|5|Good
B001GN29LI|5|Exactly as advertised. Fast shipping. Easy install.
B00C7I4JXC|5|These are good, little bags to sort small items in my pack and keep from losing them.  I wouldn't dunk them in water, but the weave will keep things somewhat dry if I'm careful.  They are small, for small odds and ends that you might otherwise search for 10 minutes to find.  Inexpensive and handy.
B000EQ83I6|5|Fits like the factory one. Easy to install.
B003S1RQ2S|5|This is a great product..<br />I00% satisfied
B0002KKIXC|5|This stuff is amazing. Will clean just about any stain off of your carpet.

B002IVD12S|5|WHAT I NEEDED
B004PHDWMM|4|Very user friendly instructions. Thankfully, we have not had to use these yet, but we have a piece of mind in case of emergency.
B004VWETFU|5|WELL DONE
B00CMOUX5E|3|The rotors that came with it were not as advertised. They were not drilled/slotted. The packaging was also torn and items were just stacked on top of one another.
B007ZG2JW4|3|I purchased this to match up with my Kartboy short throw shifter on my 07 Forester XT.  I was disappointed with how high it sat as the threads only go down half way in the plastic adapters. (Picture included) to correct this, I had to get a tap to finish the job, so that it would sit correctly in my opinion ... bottoming out of the shifter in the knob.<br /><br />This will heat up and cool down with interior temps, especially if it sits in direct sunlight. I've had only one time where it was uncomfortable to hold, due to extreme heat. I will update when the weather turns bitterly cold. Otherwise the overall feel is good, I don't even think about it, as I did with the stock shifter, nothing feels out of the ordinary just after a few drives.<br /><br />The weight isn't much different than my stock one, so I don't really feel any difference there. Also, the color isn't black, it's more of a gun metal color in my opinion. If you look at the pictures I've included, you'll see a fairly big difference.
B0009IQZFM|4|This towel can be washed in the regular wash, but it needs to air dry. It's a good drying rag, and it sucks up a lot more than my cotton towels did, I will be ordering another one so I can do my full truck
B00BI1U8VQ|1|Not impressed at all
B0000AYCSF|1|here's how the item arrived so it took a lot of work to bang it out into a shape that worked for us...it looked JUST like this out of the box...took us ages to make it fit

B004XJ0EF0|5|Product was exactly what I was looking for and delivered when promised.
B00MR2QRGK|3|Working great at first, now they aren't cutting so straight. They kind of go over each other like scissors. But they are just supposed to touch.

B00LZYROEU|5|It's a great wallet worth buying
B00OHWQAHO|2|bag is whats expected, made in China lol. It works for small item, BUT I HAVE NOT USED ON THE BIKE YET. I PICTURE THE WIND CAUSING AN ISSUE AND RIPPING THE STRAPS RIGHT OFF WHEN TIED TO MY REAR SEAT. oVER ALL CHEAP PRODUCT, BUT IT WAS CHEAP TO BUY SO WAS EXPECTED.

B005GYA618|4|Works well, fits well, would reccommend to A6 owners.
B00Z7ZH08I|5|I put these on a 2013 KLR650. Worked great. I'm 6'2&#34; - 190#. The stock bar height was just too low. Very uncomfortable for both highway and off road, especially standing. I had to eliminate a cable tie or two to keep everything moving free. I really didn't think a 1.2&#34; riser would help all that much, but it did. They look good. My bars and top tree are black, so they look almost factory. My only problem was the shipping. They came from Oregon and went to New Mexico. Took almost 2 weeks. There wasn't any other shipping options, just USPS. No next day, no 2nd day, no express, no choices. I like to get what I order ASAP, regardless of cost, just that kinda guy. All that aside, the risers are just what you need if you're a little taller than average. Try these before you go with the 2&#34; pivoting, more expensive ones. I think you'd have cable issues with those anyway.
B001KOBBAS|2|The screws were missing

B00KTIQAZW|5|Got the remote activated at a local dealership at no cost. Works flawlessly. Beats paying $250 at the dealership for a replacement.
B002855VQS|5|Lay them out the way you want them on your car, then put clear tape over them. Turn them over and remove tape from letters and stick to what you got them for. Two inch clear tape is recommended. Once the letters are applied they will not come of, the clear tape will peal off. Job done.
B000GOJWGS|5|Perfect replacement for original blower fan in 1996 Toyota Camry.  Installation is not too hard with standard tools, but you need to be flexible to get at it.
B00QSLNJ44|5|Good
B00192JGY4|5|Now I know how much propane I have left and that I do not have leaks. Great gadget.
B00NM1A8SI|3|item as described
B001FCC2QW|5|With four clasps this fits on tighter than other brands so that it does not leak.  It is hard to turn and you may need a large oil-filter wrench to tighten and remove.
B00VGL7XPW|5|very fast delivery and item was exactly what I needed
B00GYDBPL0|5|This is so cute! Love the way it looks on my car! Five stars.

B00BIA526I|5|worded great fast shipping
B0039HF3X0|1|no instructions, ended up using my own switches and wireing

B004AIMNM6|5|Works as expected so far, good price.
B004EIAADG|4|tire pump is very slow.  other than that this product is top of the line.

B007TMEQE8|5|Worked great!

B00PV5G0US|5|Arrived quickly, and fit well.
B00RUSRK1M|5|Super great !!!!!
B00FRJH1VA|4|Fits our 2015 Toyota Corolla perfectly and was easy to install. We have pulled our pop up camper and also bought a bike rack for attaching.
B00K157LTW|3|Ehh, just ok.  Color is pretty close to the grey interior of a 2000 honda accord, heal pad is nice for driver's side mat, but the mats are thin.  Positives are that they are at a good price and not all rubber/plastic, but the negative is that they are thin and feel a bit cheap.  Just OK.
B002WJ8WHK|5|Excellent resulys and easy to use. If you use it on a boat, be careful as it is slippery!
B005CQSVSA|5|Can't wait to put it on the truck, just need to find the perfect plate to go inside...
B000CIGDRE|5|Awesome quality and super easy to install
B000RDJNOY|1|wrong one.
B004O844DS|5|Took a lot longer to install than in description. But did the trick and worked out great.
B007IIPRAK|5|Love it!!
B002MH1W42|2|I thought it would have been a little more sturdy.
B007BKQC2M|2|Foam padding seams cheap. From the product image, I thought the frames were translucent and they are black.
B00ND83ADA|5|Comes with metal circlip! not all replacement handles do. Long delivery from Thailand but it's worth the wait, seems to be a solid part, easy installation.
B007V2BUCW|5|perfect fit to my porsche.

B00QAMKNYK|5|This tool was great. Everything I expected.
B0009JKI86|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000CZ2Z92|5|This fuse holder is the real McCoy.  The leads are 6 gauge. I am putting a picture on for reference.
B001MU5LSI|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000GU0MMU|1|I ordered this product thinking it was gonna get the job done just like it says it does. I followed the instructions just like it said and let the engine warm up for 15 mins and i pumped the 10-20 times and sucked only half a quart of oil out.  I had to continually pump the entire time this mad the pump hot and kept losing suction.  This simple oil change took 60 mins to complete. The following day i called the manufacturer and the said to warm up the engine for 30 mins next time and there instructions say 5 min.<br />What a bunch of crap
B00RL9LLOC|4|PITA to get on but they look great.
B00029WYVW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00E9HWS9G|2|This was suppose to fit my 2015 Toyota 4-runner, it said some other models would have to be trimmed, but it did not fit.
B005EJGSQ2|3|Good while it lasted... Made it through one season and then died.  Too bad, because it did the trick during the winter.
B00QRCQNU6|1|The first time we went out onto the highway, the cowling ripped of and we were left with just the face of Darth.  Lasted 3 days!
B0031I20NI|4|Just the right size for a Kawasaki Ninja 650.  replaced an older/oversized (XL ?) cover.
B00EOX2KZ2|5|I am so happy that I read through all the reviews so as not take chances because I hate returning things.  This product was perfect for the small utility closet in our condo with bi-fold doors.  The inner dimensions (ID) stated on the pan are smaller than what they really are.  Our washer fit in this perfectly with plenty of room to have the dryer beside it.  The pans they carry at the big box store were ginormous and way too big.... washer dryer units overall are getting smaller and more compact... so CAMCO did their due diligence with this one and I am sure many more people will buy it who have the same space problems I did or that have stackable units which this was &quot;made for&quot;.  THANKS!
B00TUNSV2W|5|I found this to be a pretty effective cleaner and degreaser in the instances I've tried it so far - floors and automobile.  It is however pretty strong and an irritant so you should use gloves, they do warn you.  It sprays in a non-staining orange color which is convenient, and it more viscous and clingy than other cleaners like simple green which are mostly water.  I like that it is environmentally friendly being citrus based and it smells good unlike some others.  Overall all, this 303 is a good product I am very happy to use.
B00GJ1D4RU|5|Smooth as silk
B004R662GY|5|Super cute! It's funny seeing people stop, look and try to figure it out.
B00B2ASZ18|5|I had to modify it a little bit, but it works great!
B00SA3WJLM|1|This is really really a crappy product. I don´t know how one can screw up a flat plate with holes drilled into it but thats exactly what happened. This thing is distorted so badly that if I didn´t have it in front of me I would not believe someone would sell such crap.
B000EDQR3M|5|The push bar on my home storm door broke,with very little adjustment this product worked well.
B003SG7BTG|5|The quality is very good, was surprised how nice they were. My boyfriend loved them
B000EH0ORI|2|Uses a glass marble in the siphon, and it's difficult to keep the flow. There's a backflow problem - not good quality device.
B009DJYDXE|5|Perfect condition.  I'm glad I saved my bolts though.  It did not come with any.
B000NU67V8|5|I put a remanufactured transmission in my F350 15000 miles ago and don't know what kind of fluid the shop put in it but when i changed the filter and used this fluid the truck never ran better.  Genuine Ford fluid for a Ford truck is the only way to go.  Thanks Amazon. Great fluid for a great price.
B00B9ZJT7A|2|Parts were missing and the plastic rivets did not stay in place...item returned.
B00N31BY30|5|Quick shipping had them fast and the work perfectly.  No more waiting for my door to be unlocked manually.
B00NBN1C78|4|Item is well-packaged in styrofoam, with everything already inside the metal box that everything stores in.  When you open that up, the first thing you see is all the mounting hardware.  You don't have to dig for that.<br /><br />The lug wrench is a 4-way lug wrench, with two of the sides being hinged so that it folds down into a compact size to fit into the box.  It has locking rings that slide down over the hinges on those two arms to keep those in place.<br /><br />The jack is a standard scissors-style that raises and lowers by the center screw which is turned with the included bar with a curved end that attaches to the jack.  The other end has a rectangular shape that fits into the 90-degree turning handle.  The handle has a nice rubber grip that makes turning a little easier.  As with all jacks of this type, you have to really watch what you are doing so the handle or turning arm doesn't disengage before you finish.<br /><br />When putting it all back into the box, you need to be sure to put the lug wrench in alongside the jack (at the same time).  If you put the jack in first, you will have an extremely difficult time getting the wrench in.  It is not tight in there, though, so it is going to make noise as you go down the road.  We added some cloth to keep it quiet.<br /><br />It has a place to put a lock to keep it from opening, which is nice.
B000CPHXLM|5|Classic look,classic sound.
B00LFL7RLI|5|Arrived on time. Installed nicely. No more ABS light.
B00AYA3Q0M|5|These fit great. A lot stiffer than I imagined. Thad a good thing. Like a shell.
B000CPCCRM|5|i love these. 2000 tacoma sr5 v6 and the ride is better than stock. worth the price
B001G6T5F8|5|Timely and as advertised.
B000EPXUTO|5|Great master cylinder fits just like stock, easy install i highly recommend
B002P8JJ2U|1|CAUTION!<br />Electrical connection is different and not compatible.  Arrived quickly and good condition.  Stupidly,  I did not return in time, and now I will need to eat the cost while I look for the right 3-pin connector type.
B005G55M0W|5|Great product, great price ... much cheaper than I could find locally in my town. In fact, I could not even find an AGM battery for my 1982 Yamaha.<br />So, I'm real happy to find this one! Fit perfectly and so far, working well.
B001C6LG3Q|5|Excellent choice, works very well. Packaging was great and arrived on time.
B0007LZI8G|5|Works fine and keeps you from getting ball grease on your pants when walking by.
B00WDSVEE8|4|good item!
B00GHHU00K|5|Good fit for 2005 VW Touareg.
B00CD2RHCC|3|the product came in very scratched up even under the clear film, I had to go out and buy the bolts for the rivit holes the ones that came with the flares were bad threads on some bolts and nuts. would not buy again nor will i recomend
B000MY1RB0|5|easy product...I like the finish.
B00F8PS5T0|2|Do you ever see those cars with highly noticeable bright Front light? --- This is not one of them.<br /><br />Typically, I do not leave a negative feedback. However, I will make an exception this time. Please read this and judge for yourself if I am being unreasonable.<br /><br />One may argue, what do you expect from a $45 product as opposed to $200 product? Well, I am not comparing different brands. I am strictly going off from what the product actually is, in comparison to what the seller promised, &#34;it will light up the halo rings much brighter and much crystal than most conventional LED BMW angel eyes products everywhere else&#34;<br /><br />The abovementioned statement made by the seller is certainly not true. And, the picture sample shown by the seller is certainly misleading. I am attaching a photo of my vehicle that has been installed with seller's product as evidence.<br /><br />Imagine a car coming towards you from the opposing lane. You can't tell whether or not if that car coming toward you has a light or not -- This lamp is exactly just that. You can't really tell that something is installed unless you examine it closely.<br /><br />However, I am going to give two stars because when the car is under the shadow, the light is clearly there.<br /><br />As far as these claims that the seller had made, they are misleading and false.<br />- &#34;Super Bright Xenon ... Super Bright White Angel Eyes &#34;<br />- &#34;it will light up the halo rings much brighter and much crystal than most conventional LED BMW angel eyes products everywhere else&#34;
B00TJ6PKAQ|5|Love these.  Helps cords stay in place and you are not searching for struggling where to put them.
B0056OFWVM|5|Works great. Easy to use
B00KFVDULA|1|I ordered black levers with black adjusters. But I got black with red. I'm not happy.
B00EHIOSPO|5|Great product! Works as described. Amazing customer service. They went above and beyond to help me out with an ordering mistake. Will definitely purchase another set for my other car.
B00F6XAO6G|4|Perfect fit at a resonable price.
B00PWKHOWA|5|Great product!!
B00QLOY0ZA|4|Nice. Very flexible. 3m doble tape.The only thing I don't like is the mirror don't fold complete.
B00FC22AS6|5|Bright direct fit and plug and play. Used to use ddm tuning but these are a little cheaper and with prime shipping is nice. Beats 2 week shipping from ddm.
B0002MBUP0|3|They are a bit large for my older Camry. Heavy, hold water and clean easy.
B00GOXMTBK|5|fast shipping  was as advertised
B00BFLW8VW|5|as advertised.  Good product exact fit, Good price.
B00EFDJB8A|5|love it gorgeous hot pink , came right on time and look exactly as shown .
B00VJRGA8E|5|I purchased this to replace an older WinCE unit. After a few weeks of use, I am very happy with the unit and have to say that it is much better than I expected.<br /><br />Unit takes half a minute to boot up when you start your car, just like cold booting an Android phone. However, the video from the reverse camera (if you have one attached) appears immediately and is independent of the Android boot process.<br /><br />1. Radio - Standard AM FM with RDS and presets. If your original car radio came with a diversity antenna or an antenna amplifier make sure they are accounted for in your installation or you won't get good reception.<br /><br />2. DVD / CD player - I don't use this much but did test it when I received the unit to verify it worked. Played all the movies I tried without issue.<br /><br />3. Wi Fi - Connects to my home WiFi without any problems when I'm parked in the garage. Can browse the web, use the Play Store to install and update apps, shop on Amazon, etc. I haven't tried the unit with a portable hotspot yet. Note this unit is NOT a phone and there is no persistent internet connection unless you use WiFi (I haven't tried the 3G USB dongle which is apparently available as an option).<br /><br />4. USB input - I've put my music library on a 256Gb thumb drive and connected it to one of the two USB inputs. I use the PowerAmp app for an MP3 player, and it reads the drive and recognizes all of the 20000+ tunes available. It takes a while to read the directory (it takes a while on my PC also).<br /><br />5. Backup camera - Works fine.<br /><br />6. Torque (ODBII application) - I have a mini ELM327 bluetooth type unit the I plug into the ODBII socket under my steering wheel. The included Torque app displays ODBII engine diagnostic information from the vehicle computer. Supposedly some units are finicky about recognizing the ODBII adapter, mine works fine (luck?).<br /><br />7. Bluetooth - Works great with my Galaxy S3. Transferred contacts phone numbers listwithout issue. Initiates and answers calls without issue. It also supports music streaming from the phone, but on a somewhat limited level because the MP3 tag info is not displayed on the head unit. Similarly to the WinCE unit this is replacing, you can only play, pause, and skip forward or backward. To my ears the fidelity over bluetooth in the music mode is good.<br /><br />8. MicroSD Card - I've only tried it with a 32Gb card and it worked fine. There are actually two MicroSD card slots, but one is reserved for the GPS.<br /><br />9. GPS - I reused the existing GPS antenna I had and it works well. Thus far I have only used the included iGo app and for basic navigation it works acceptably.<br /><br />10. Front camera / DVR app - Haven't tried. I already have a separate dash cam recorder.<br /><br />Take note that the height and width of the unit is a bit larger (3 or 4 mm) than the double DIN opening in the dash install kit I bought for my Camry. Some careful Dremeling solved that problem. In my case the depth was not an issue and once the front opening on the dash kit was expanded everything (lots of back connections) fit fine.<br /><br />The unit looks sharp after installation and so far the screen has proven to have good driver visibility day or night. Direct sunlught will wash it out to an extent of course but it is MUCH superior to the same size screen on the older WinCE unit it replaced.<br /><br />I've left the firmware in my unit unrooted and completely stock so far, but anyone really interested should check out the xda developer's forum for tons of additional info and mods.
B003VZEVY2|4|Look on my trike
B000NW157M|5|Worked for me....
B00905J37W|1|excellent
B00TH2G57O|5|Works perfectly took about 15 min to install, I bench tested before I started my installation. I found the in and out wires were opposite of what the directions indicated. Took a while to ship but I think they come from china. Happy customer looking forward to using on the trail.
B00BYFWCYW|4|Works well, but most of the cables are too short and may require extension (installed in Jeep Wrangler).
B002MQDY4O|5|Fast delievery and fits perfectly:)
B00K890RBU|5|This battery works just fine for my Simon XT system. No problems.
B009AY4GQ6|5|Great, Correct part easy to install, worked perfectly \.  Made the Honda bike start like it never has before.  Quick Shipping.
B00JBIB0GA|5|Fitment is 9/10; slight gap where the corner lamp housing meets the fender but almost unnoticeable; nobody else will see it unless you point it out. Light output from the headlamps is about the same as stock housings. They are supplied with some cheap 9007 lamps, don't bother with those. Spend the money on something decent like Sylvania Silverstars (which is what I did) or get an HID conversion (which I am considering even though I already spent $60 on the Silverstars). Very happy with the purchase, and so far there have been no condensation issues due to improper sealing at the factory (as is very common with all aftermarket housings).
B0024E6ZW2|5|So far so good
B007X6TBLS|5|This is a quality part at a value price.
B002PYBZJO|5|Wow! I was completely shocked.  I bought this product just for the elm cable but I decided to gove the software a try.  I half expected ot to be full of viruses and very cheap.  However it was not.  It is an incredible piece of software for a generic OBD II scan tool. It has a lot of features that I would not expect for the price.  I was impressed with the data logging capability and the customizable aspects of data readouts.<br /><br />I have been an automotive professional for over 17 years and have used all types scan tools from generic to manufacturer specific.  Even with this experience I was really impressed by this software.  It is something I would have expected to cost a lot more.<br /><br />This is not a professional scan tool (obviously) but for your OBD II needs anf for the price, it is amazing!<br /><br />This is one of the best purchases I have ever made and I have already recommended it to many other people.
B00LUPOSD4|5|Performed well and are well made
B003EM7IYW|2|These seat covers are well made, look good, and are easy to install and, under other circumstances would receive a much higher rating.  However, the Amazon (very helpful and generally useful) comparison of my car type to the various products available) selection of the correct seat covers did not work.  I have a 2004 Jeep Wrangler two door Unlimited extended (I do not think that they make these anymore) which compared the seat covers to a Jeep TJ model.  The rear seats can use the Coverking Custom fit seat cover but the front buckets (on my car) are bigger (longer) and the cut out for the seat back tilt out (to allow people entry into the back seat) mechanism is higher than the cutout on the seat covers sent.  The ones sent are unusable and will have to be returned.<br />Do not bother to write Coverking (the company that distributes the seat covers to Amazon) for any kind of discussion via e-mail.  They completely ignore that process and do not respond.
B00K9BFRSK|5|so cool its almost worth the accident
B00KCQSIRY|4|It was a little hard to install, but looks great 👌🏼 on my buggy 😁
B00AYSU47M|5|perfect
B005P54G0A|5|Great price! Nice product.
B00B6FBLFG|5|Wonderful! I bought a really old Louis Vuitton that was so dry and cracking. This product was recommended to me and my purse looks so much better! Before and after picture
B00C8E0T0C|5|Great helmet for my daughter. She loves it and it provides good protection.
B001C97V4Q|1|Does not open at appropriate temp
B00MJLCV5U|5|Perfect
B0007M4MKA|5|Works good
B00O83OF38|4|Good replacement. No instructions, no screws, and wire harness does not fit well. I had to force it and luckily it connected. Best of all no leaks. Do not over tighten screws the plastic will crack.
B006FUT0CS|5|The product is effective and produces a clean and high quality shine.
B00XW01OLO|1|I. Believe the mat. Is missing a. Center cover<br />It. Is too overriced
B001UP1F26|5|Good quality material
B00LBF63JA|1|Does not work for 2012 dodge ram even took my truck to local car audio shop whitch installs lights all the time. Had to use normal led bulbs
B00MW8G78C|5|Easy to program and affordable!
B00A7L1V3W|5|Great lights for night
B001DKO3X6|5|This made quick work of some ice storms we've had. I not sure how this would hold up for the Northern climates. It did help me break through some ice up to 1 to 1-1/2 inches thick though.
B00J3NPOM4|5|Great
B0026N1UOE|5|It's work just like OEM I be using on Mercury Villager.
B00DP9MXZS|4|Wrap worked great! Shipping was fast, it showed up sooner than expected. As stated in some other reviews the wrap is not crisp black its more of a dull color. That did not bother me, I sprayed a coat of black high temp paint over it anyway to help keep the hairs down and stop any fraying that may occur. It applied well, I just threw it in a bucket of water, wrapped my crossover and let it dry. It is holding tight with no strands hanging. The only think i don't like is the steel ties. they are hard to get tight and don't hold tight.  Over all  great product and would buy again on my next project.
B0038B7HJK|5|Headlights look amazing!! Fast delivery, great packing, easy to install!! will use this seller again!! thanks td
B009S2YBOW|3|Thanks
B00FN3PO4Q|4|Is to good
B00OQPRPK8|5|This is a must have for all the cars...so neat and easy to use, previously i would have issues keeping things in the car, if we keep bottle on the seat, water spills, ipad have to be carried in hand, so much to keep and hardly any space and then one would end up looking for things in the car. So would recommend this for all
B00BITI6Q2|4|Works great
B00BD3K526|5|great hitch for the money and easy to install
B004W5TJMO|5|Perfect fit and in about 10 mins. If you can get the old off, you can do these. If you have had the original on for a while you may notice fading so might want to explore if changing both is the thing to do. I did and glad.
B00FOX5D9Q|5|I was admittedly a bit leery at first. The only other HID conversion I've ever done to any of my cars, was actually using the full on European hid version for my car. No conversion, no adding ballasts. I ordered a projector beam version headlight for my current car and ordered this 4300 kit, along with their h7 wiring harness. With it being well over 100 degrees outside and parked in the shade, I accomplished the complete install in under 90 minutes. Plug and play. Nice and easy. Great output. No complaints.
B0001EXSJ0|4|Easy installation. Instructions could have been more precise. Havent Tested thru a &#34; touchless car wash &#34; yet. I'll add more info when i do. Update, Ran my vehicle thru a touchless car wash with no problems. The high pressure wash nor the air dry, affected the tape that mounts to the hood.
B00WH1ZC80|5|Amazing product
B0052SMYQS|5|Whay can i say it shut the window and it stayed closed no wow factor
B00ULNXJNG|5|Easy to install. Good quality.
B0009JKGJ2|5|Works great
B003K5S4NW|1|Leaves the windshield streaky and cloudy.
B00V8AATX4|5|Love it!! Easy fix to a ripped console. Looks great!
B007TYB6DA|4|Works great
B00OQ1F7PM|1|does not charge a battery below 2 volts
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Bought this for my Mercedes SUV which has an enormous windshield. This sunshade fits perfectly and keeps the inside of the car much cooler. I like it a lot because it's easy to fold and then I can put it between my seat and center console when driving, which is so much more convenient than having to store some huge screen in the trunk. Great customer service! They even sent me a PDF of instructions to help with folding it up--once you get the hang of it (which take less than a minute), it's super easy. Highly recommend!
B000CNN26E|5|I purchased it for my husband and he loves it! I asked him what his thoughts were and he said the sound was perfect. He said that it's the perfect middle ground for an average Joe with a truck. It's not too loud, but it's still not too quite. Easy to install and it fit without a problem.
B0000AXQPA|5|Came quick and worked great.
B006FUT15Y|5|Headlight Sealant lasts more than 6 months w/ regular washes. Haven't had to apply any more protection.<br />Seems to work great
B00DGX63FE|4|It works great.
B000CQHVLI|5|Fast shipping and good price! Have ordered LD toner for a few years and work great in Canon and HP printers. Out of fifty or so purchased have only had 1 that was bad and they immediately replaced it no questions.
B001FAGJAY|5|I was surprised by how simple it was to install. It appears to do it's job well. I don't usually have to lock it but the option is there if I am parking in a spot I don't trust.
B000AP6RD4|5|Have had K&N products over the years and all have performed well.
B00XAX4B9A|2|It seemed like a good idea at the time.  It covers my windshield just fine.  It's folding it back up that is bad.  I've watched all the videos on folding to no avail.  And....what really upset me was that there were NO instructions or directions on HOW to fold it up and put it back in it's bag.  Am I just supposed to know how to do it????  So when I am not using it....it's in the back seat taking up the whole back of the car.  Good thing I don't have passengers because there's no place to sit.  No....I don't like it and will go back to the accordion style.
B00IA9QURA|4|good product .just what I was looking for. didn't want to go huge. i'm happy with product. I put this on with jackstands in my driveway
B00KMYYQ1S|4|Product went on very well with the 32 oz spray bottle. Time will tell if it is every thing stated.
B003YMTJ2G|5|Came quickly, correct part, great price. Perfect.
B008N2JLRU|5|All weather from Hyundai, have Sonata on the mats.
B0009IQZH0|2|Whats the point of these towels if all they do is leave lint all over the place.
B006KVWYA2|5|Perfect fit on my 1983 V45 magna. Works great.
B00513G82U|1|Trunk lid cracked in half in less than a season  no heavy used to cause it.  My shed has a better latch to lock it
B0002YUQ4E|5|This single tube made us at least 300 bucks by identifying bakelite jewerly that we may nave over looked. it also polishes metal. LOL
B001H1I40O|5|Just what I needed.shipped very fast .
B005HMOSSG|1|4 lights didn't work right out the box. Very disappointed. Others look good but half the product was defective.
B006F8ZG7S|5|super great deal fast shipping
B00OAB48M6|5|Excellent Seller, fast shipping!!! Great product!!! Thanks!!!!
B000C8RATE|3|Heavy.  Tons of glue on the sides and a LOT of airflow resistance compared to the OEM Honda Carbon Filters.<br /><br />Box says &#34;Made in Taiwan&#34;<br />Product reads &#34;Made in China&#34;.<br /><br />I cleaned out the OEM, &#34;Made in USA&#34; Honda filters and put them back in the car.  Not sure what to do with these.  They're nicer than the store bought ones but the strong resistance to air flow is a downer. Maybe I just got a bad set, overloaded with carbon.
B00R6KWH2Q|5|These replacements were almost identical as the original locking straps that came with my Thule Vertex 2 bike rack. My original set of straps lasted 4 years. These replacement straps are made of high quality material, well constructed, and sold for great low price! I hope that they last as long as the originals. :o)<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase!
B003TPC58S|5|My board went bad due to water leaking in. This part was a direct fit. You need a star wrench to remove the tail light and a phillip head for the screws inside. It should only take MAYBE 10 minutes to install. Works great and doing it yourself will save a ton of money!
B009MC124K|5|Yes fit perfectly
B0069TND14|5|mounted on my 2&#34; pvc guide ons on 2 different trailers and they are GREAT my neighbor liked it so much he did the same<br /><br />VERY BRIGHT!<br />WELL MADE BUT USE A WASHER ON BOTH ENDS OF LIGHT tighten carfull
B0038N1VD6|5|It's good and cheaper than Dealership. You may have to modify the vent connection for 2001 Miata. My vents were rectangle and this one had round connection.
B0071MFJN8|1|I bought a full set of Sensen struts and strut mounts from another vendor (initials RA). They are the worst parts I have ever put on a car. I replaced the struts and mounts on my 1999 Toyota Avalon because they were noisy; the replacement Sensen parts made MORE NOISE than the original parts within ONE DAY of installation.<br /><br />These aren't even good enough to put on a car you are going to sell immediately.<br /><br />The Sensen parts have a lifetime warranty, but the warranty is only valid for replacement with the same low quality part.
B00BW9UTGS|5|Just what I needed.
B00GDGEA6K|5|Very high quality.
B00T2U112A|5|easily organized my plier drawer in my tool box works great bought three for all my pliers, vise grips and crescent wrenches
B004IA3YQK|2|item is made incorrectly......does not fit the bulb, as the way to mount bulb into headlite is in the way, 2004 chevy impala
B00AKHRK1U|5|Product is of good quality so far. Shifts feel more precise and shifter moves decisevely into position.<br /><br />As for installation, it's a tight fit and the bolts aren't easy to line up when lying on the ground under the car. Clear instructions are provided and it's really simple to find a video on youtube if needed.
B00KTHT4ZQ|5|I was skeptical at first, but this remote was easy to program and works great.
B000CIT3N0|5|Used them for 15k oil changes and no problems
B00HS1HOFI|5|Arrived on time, Fit perfectly but a little tricky to install for the home mechanic..
B00JBIBVFA|5|Excellent
B000C1MW8K|5|I just replaced my first set of Akebono front pads on our '06 TL with a new set. With 70k miles on the first set, they still had about 15% of material to the squealer. They were just starting to pulse a little so I decided to put on the new ones anyway. The first set were very low dusting and up to 70k always provided smooth, pulse free, strong braking. I have used a number of different brands of pads over the years and usually the big auto stores lifetime warranty brands. Mostly with mixed results, maybe 45k or 50k miles life. These are a little more expensive than the others I have used but well worth the little extra $$ for smooth and clean performance. I hate it when the wheels are dirty from pad dust in just a couple days of driving. Not here. Impressive product.
B000SL4A84|5|Nice
B00NR52FQC|5|Mounted these overhead in a topper. Gives plenty of bright, even light with no shadows. Easy to install.
B0019BSGTQ|4|looks and feels great!  was hoping for clips but it didn't say it came with them so all is well..
B001DUIICI|5|A

B00CH8AX1O|5|Right part and shipped as quoted.
B00CRR5KXG|5|So far so good. It seems to be made well. I'll write back if it fails.
B00D393IOU|4|This Awning cover looks good and seems very durable, the only thing I noticed is the front flap that covers the roller is squared off and not a wave look like the original, this may bother others
B000A835AY|5|Yeah very good products and very shinny for my leathers.
B0024ECGZC|5|Works great easy to remove and then put on

B00H15WHU8|4|Good
B00RZXVQSU|5|AWESOME!!!
B002DZJQ0A|4|Strong enough to hold up my ezpass.
B00JA3BMDW|4|We got this to check temperatures on a silicone mat and to use as a candy thermometer. It seems to work well. Not 100% sure on the accuracy, but things are turning out fine so I assume it is ok. It works well and it came with batteries. It was easy to use.
