The movie that it inspired was similar but, of course, much more superficial as movies are wont to be.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this as an intriguing look at some of the issues and implications that would surely arise should we someday find ourselves faced with proof that we are not alone in this vast cosmos.
B000KCHWCC|5.0|David Bowie-The Man Who Sold The World *****<br /><br />In the carear of David Bowie he has created many of the worlds greatest albums, songs and styles of music. No one Bowie album is like another and this, The Man Who Sold The World is one that manages to somehow stand out more then almost any other album the man has ever created. The Man Who Sold The World rock's harder then any other album Bowie ever made, and it's the most straight forward rock album the man ever made and is probabley David Bowie's most accesable album as well. Featuring The Spiders From Mars this album is sure to please. Mick Ronson's guitar playing is the best on here, this album is easily one of the greatest guitar albums ever, this show why Ronson was one of the best. David's vocals as always thrill and his songwriting is more rock and roll then anything else and its great.<br /><br />The album opens up with what is David Bowie's all time best song, 'The Width Of A Circle' this eight minute plus song is the hardest rocker Bowie ever made and is just such a cool song that must be heard to appreciate. Mick Ronson play's his all time best guitar solo ever on this track as well. The perfect opener! 'All The Madman' is another heavy rocker, not as hard but really heavy. Great lyrics and Bowie's amazing voacals and Viscotti's bass playing make this a truly great song. The next song, 'Black Country Rock' is one of the better songs on the album with a killer riff and solo by Ronson and Bowie's nice vocals this song comes across almost as something that should have been on Led Zeppelin I. 'After All' is a slower, darker song with errie vocals from David. The lyrics are really good, but the \\"Oh By Jingo\\" thing is kinda weird but that doesnt mean its bad, just weird. 'Running Gun Blues' is a great song about a serial killer felling guilty and sorry. Not one of the best songs on the album but still a good track. 'Saviour Machine' is a cool song about \\"The Church\\" and how people devote their whole lives to something they really have no prove about. Nice lyrics and pretty catchy as well. The next song is another one that really shows off Mick Ronson's amazing guitar playng ability. The heavyly distorted wah-wah pedal and slide guitar add a really nice touch to this already killer song. 'She Shook Me Cold' is another song that could have been on Led Zeppelin I, but then again this song is too good for Led Zeppelin I so never mind. Next is the legendary title track, \\"The Man Who Sold The World' which was covered by Nirvana on their unplugged album which they did decent but dont truly do justice as Bowie's original is just amazing. The lyrics are some of the best ever written by anyone, and the delivery is just flat out fantastic. Truly one of Bowie's brighter moments. The album closes with the right song, 'The Supermen' is just the song to end The Man Who Sold The World, because its hard and it rocks and it leaves you wanting more and not being able to wait untill you buy your next David Bowie album. Everyone really come together on this track, the lyrics are good as well as Bowie vocals the bass and drums flow perfectly and Mick's guitar is not to be challenged.<br /><br />The Man Who Sold The World is easily one of David Bowie's all time best albums, as there is no filler and all the songs rock. this album is a true gem in a collection of albums full of gems. Do yourself a favor and get this largly overlooked classic!e their whole lives to something they really have no prove about. Nice lyrics and pretty catchy as well.

You feel like you are going through the journey with her.  For the first time, I wish I knew what I could do to help spread her message.  For now, I will recommend this book highly to everyone I know.  I resented anything that interrupted my reading.
B000MM0L4Q|2.0|David Bowie-Young Americans **<br /><br />Young Americans is clearly not one of David Bowies strongest or best albums. I commend him in his willingness to try new things but this, this clearly did not work, now dont get me wrong Bowie can be plenty soulful when he wants to but this album is just generaly weak all around. Most of the songs come across as sad wannabe disco numbers, or left over demos from a Beegee's album. Clearly the songwriting genius that is David Bowie was not present on the making of this album. Even though a few of the songs went down as classics that doesnt even come close to making up for a entire album full of lackluster efferts.<br /><br />The album opens up with the title track 'Young Americans' and while that song became a pretty big hit for David Bowie in 1975 it is not concedered a classic Bowie song and it most certaintly does not still get radio play. The song becomes tierd and old by the end of the second listen. While 'Win' is a decent ballad it's not a song you can listen to very often because like the song before it this one does get old quickly. 'Fascination' is a souless atempt at a soul song that every time I hear it, it makes me think it is a left over Beegee's tune that he snagged. 'Right' is a just downright boring disco song that like most of the other songs on this album gets old very very fast! 'Somebody Up There Likes Me' is a religious disco song if there is such a thing, its gosphol dance music, which is done very poorly, had this been on any other album, a glam or new wave Bowie album he would have made the lyrics work perfectly bu insted they go to waste on this porr excuse for a Disco track, if only he had held off on it for one more album and put it on Station To Station. It is very hard to mess up a song so good and classic as The Beatles (John Lennon penned), 'Across The Universe' and Bowie, while he doesnt do it as good or better then The beatles did he does do it very well. This is his second best cover song of his carear. It's not as bad as people make it out to be. 'Can You Hear Me' is a decent little soul number that I can actually say I do enjoy. The only good soul song on the album and he actually has soul when he sings it to which is always good, when your singing a soul song anyway. The next song is a classic among classics, one of David Bowies all time best songs. 'Fame' took the world by storm and earned David Bowie the privlage of being the first white person to perform on Soul Train, which is a really big deal even to this day. Not only that it was David Bowies first number one song in America and maybe in the UK as well. But whats more is the song is actually performed with John Lennon, how cool is that. 'Fame' was most deffinatley the right choice for how to end the album! To bad such a gem got lost on a lackluster of an album like Young Americans. I guess you could call it a diamond in the ruff.<br /><br />Young Americans is a bad David Bowie album theres is no other way to put it. But I will say it is worth it for the last three songs because its got two classics so still pick it up.ver song of his carear. It's not as bad as people make it out to be.

0374105235|5.0|This is an amazing read! Ishmael uses simple language to describe what has got to be one of the most significant atrocities of mankind. This book is what a lot of people need to read to appreciate the value of their own lives and circumstances. What a bubble many of us live in - complaining about the \\"stesses\\" of our lives. We have no idea........ <br /> <br />Book of the decade! For sure.

Thank you Robert Spenser for your courageous and intellectually honest research.

It's not the end of the franchise for it will have several more interesting sequels such as the excellent \\"Saw 4\\" that came out recently, i swear these movies keep getting more fun and more interesting.<br /><br />This DVD contains the much more extended version with more gore and character development then the previous unrated and theatrical editions.

B0000844M8|5.0|Having first seen this movie in my youth and recently watching it again as an adult, it has never lost its charm or appeal and I think it deserves to stand as one of the most fulfilling and heartwarming family films ever made.  As it is based on a true story, that makes it even better.  And what a story it is too.<br /><br />Game warden George Adamson and his wife Joy are residents in Kenya, Africa and relate their experiences of raising an orphaned lion cub after the mother has been shot out of self-defense reasons.  Actually it is three lion cubs but two are sent off to a zoo and the third, eventually named Elsa, is raised by Joy Adamson.  It is interesting and enjoyable to watch the interaction of the cub with the adults and the relationship that grows ever closer between them.  Upon raising the cub to maturity, it becomes a difficult time for the Adamson's knowing that releasing the grown lion into the wild is the only real answer.  Due to being tame for so long, it is Joy's responsibility now to train Elsa to be able to survive on its own and she does an admirable job.  When the fateful day finally comes, it tugs at the heart strings to see the emotional effects on the Adamson's when releasing something they love so dearly.  It is also inspiring knowing that they cared so much and did it for all the right reasons.  It eventually makes for a wonderful end to a great movie.<br /><br />As for the film particulars, the cinematography is very attractive in Africa and the accompanying music is a perfect compliment to everything else.  The acting is so innocent and natural you can almost be fooled into believing this isn't a movie.  For being a timeless classic that is now over 4 decades old, this movie stands the test of time and will always be a treasure for anyone and everyone.  This is a highly recommended film all around.
075640407X|5.0|A new author who writes like a veteran. You will enjoy reading this story. You will enjoy meeting and knowing the characters. The author doesn't waste words, but instead pulls you through the story and into an incredible journey with every sentence on every page. I couldn't put it down, yet I didn't want to finish too quickly so I could linger in his world. Now I can't wait for the next one!
B00009N83Y|3.0|For a movie made in the mid 80's, you'd think pairing up 2 superstars like Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds would make for a smash hit but it just wasn't meant to be.  The plot isn't terribly exciting and the acting didn't raise any eyebrows but there was just enough humor and a few goofy situations to keep it from total destruction.<br /><br />It's the 1930's and the time of prohibition, gangland activity, and all the nefarious activity that goes with it.  Eastwood plays the seasoned, grizzled lieutenant in the police department trying to keep a hold on his city while Reynolds is his former partner now turned private eye who just can't seem to stay out of trouble.  These two trade wisecracks and insults throughout the film and put themselves into some corny predicaments that merit a few laughs here and there.  It seems that they're both trying to outdo each other also so that distracts a little but not too much.  They finally team up together to save the day and roust the gangsters in a predictable and unexciting ending.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot of saving graces other that what has already been mentioned but at least you can see some different, although hollow, acting performances by Madeline Kahn, Rip Torn, Richard Roundtree, Jane Alexander, and Irene Cara.  It's not enough to rescue the film but if you go into watching this with the idea that it's just a guilty pleasure and nothing more, you probably won't feel so bad about wasting an hour and a half of your time.
0751532711|4.0|To address some of the questions the reader might have: <br /> <br />* It is written in an easy to read language. <br />* The presented materials will take only an afternoon hours to read <br />* It contains some fundamental rules about investing money. <br />* It contains enough story elements to be interesting. <br /> <br />This book can be considered fundamental reading material of every investor as the basic principles apply to other forms of investment as well. Real estate investments are a good goal to have, but for most of us it is not that easy to finance a home. <br />    <br />The author has many good ideas but often seems to be vague in delivering strategies that give concrete advice. If you need more ideas this book is recommeded highly! <br />
1401302378|3.0|Simply put, this book contains 100 pages of absolution wonderful information scattered across 225 pages.  It gets (very) repetitive and dull.  Another negative is that the author draws a lot of uncritically broad parallels.  For example, he regularly compares the demand curve on music CD sales in brick-and-mortar stores to the demand curve for on-line services such as Rhapsody.  I'm not convinced that a business model that sells music subscriptions would ever have the same demand curve as a sale-by-the unit business.   The book's assumption that the difference is due entirely to distribution differences is a little simplistic. <br /> <br />However, despite these weaknesses, don't write this book off.  The author's concepts of how the internet is changing the business environment are some of the best I've seen.  I love the fact that his points are backed up by real statistics rather than hype and hearsay.  I definitely plan on leveraging this knowledge in my business and personal pursuits.  (Which is more than I can say of many books I've read)
081541028X|5.0|Michael Collins' \\"Carrying the Fire\\" is the best first-person account written by a Gemini/Apollo-era astronaut.  Collins' narrative is told from a layman's perspective and does a great job of explaining the more complex aspects of lunar spaceflight in terms all can understand.<br /><br />Collins also portrays his, in my opinion, major contributions to the space program and personal abilities in a very humble, almost self-deprecating fashion; all an unusual trait for an astronaut.  There is a striking comparison between Collins' descriptions of his own endeavors and abilities and those by other authors, such as Deke Slayton in \\"Deke\\" or Gene Cernan in \\"Last Man on the Moon\\".<br /><br />I read this for the first time over 20 years ago, and continue to take it off the shelf from time to time.  It's easily one of my top five favorite non-fiction titles.
B000FIMG68|1.0|Caught half a new episode by accident and it's reminded me how unwatchable the show is and maybe enabled me to better articulate why.  <br />My major beef with Lost is the overuse of one-shots. Almost every time someone is speaking no-one else's face is allowed in the shot so it creates the effect of just one person talking to the camera. You never see the other participant in a conversation reacting while someone is speaking, like whether they're rolling their eyes or nodding or whatever, so it doesn't feel like a conversation. The directors apparently think their audience is too stupid to follow two characters emoting/acting at once.  <br />Also the sets and especially the ambient noise give such a fake sterile atmosphere.  <br />And the fact that the writing is so dull, plots are so slow, and characters have no personality.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I'm a fan of Kate W. Her acting in this film was just OK, but she was much better than the others. Cameron is awlful. I stopped watching this film about 45 minutes in before I threw up. Cameron kissing a total drunken stranger within 3 minutes of him waking her up in the middle of the night????? Come on?!? All the chics giving this drek 5 stars think that was romantic? Do they want to do the same thing? How did she know he was really Kate's brother? Why didn't he have his own key? Couldn't the writers (using that term loosely) come up with a better way for Cameron to meet Mr. Law? Jack Black's eyebrows would scare any woman with eyes. In reality, he wouldn't be able to pick up the 2 am bar-closing dregs. He's only good in zany goofball comedies. As a romantic comedy lead, that's just too much of a stretch. I can't believe anyone spent a dime financing the making of such a terrible idea. It couldn't have looked good even on paper! Gong this loser! Don't waste your money!
B00005UKE0|5.0|When George Harrison broke free from those other three clowns, it was the wisest thing he ever did!  No longer constrained to \\"Papa Lennon,\\" \\"Mama Mc.Cartney\\" or \\"Sibling Starr,\\" his talent exploded and he could finally joyously chant the Hare Krsna Mantra with total freedom!<br /><br />(I shouln't be so hard on Ringo!  He played drums for Harrison on this album!)<br /><br />This album has special meaning for me!  In my 20's in Pocatello, Idaho, every spring I had a ritual.  It didn't matter what vehicle I owned, whether the Volkswagen Beetle, the souped-up Javelin (Holy J) or the Firebird, I always had a killer audio system in it.  The system evolved from 8 track to cassette.  And I would drive that vehicle through the mountains on Cherry Creek road while blasting this album joyously!  All Things Must Pass is so positive and uplifting!<br /><br />Now I am 52, and my vehicle of choice is my Toyota Tacoma.  My medium of choice is the iPod.  My system of choice is a 700 watt Thump kicker, piped into two massive Polk Audio subwoofers, coupled into two huge horn tweeters in back of the extended cab! \\"EH....eh...:)\\"<br /><br />And my album of choice to make all the drivers on their cell phones angry at me as I drive my commute is this album!<br /><br />All I need to do now is to drive my truck back to Pocatello, on Cherry Creek Road to complete this glorious metamorphosis!  While frying the truck's electrical system blasting All Things Must Pass to the world!

B000N6U0E2|3.0|Based on a true story, 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is the story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) and the difficulties in his life prior to \\"making it\\".  His wife Linda (played by Thandie Newton (Crash)) just can't take the hardships anymore and leaves.  Chris is left with custody of his son Christopher (played by Smith's own son Jaden Smith).<br /><br />Chris suffers through many hardships, including eviction, staying in homeless shelters, tax collectors, and being jailed overnight for parking tickets.  He still manages to hang onto his son Christopher, even through devastating privation.  Chris is intent on selling a high end but spendy bone scanner machine to the medical community, but when his opportunity comes up to make a bid at becoming an employee of Dean Witter, he decides to go for it despite the unpaid time and attention it will take from his despairing life.<br /><br />Chris obtains a one in a lifetime shot, by hard work alone, to obtain the position he dreamed of.  But as one other reviewers put it, we never get the chance to see Chris on the high end of his hard work.  The movie would have been better if it had shown the results of Chris's dedication and determination.  Instead, we're left in the darkness of his becoming, with a few on-screen announcements intended to satisfy our need for closure of Chris's troubles.<br /><br />While very well done, the movie only earns three stars from me because of the abrupt ending.  It's one thing to document someone's hardship, but if (as in real life as the movie portrays) there is a happy ending, then the movie should include the happy ending.  I didn't sit through all this anguish for nothing.  Worth a rent, it's up to you for a purchase.  Enjoy!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie's third \\"best of\\" is great, almost perfect except for a few points. The DVD alone is worth the price, specially for the live version of Edge of Seventeen from The White Winged Dove Tour and the never before seen home video from the making of Bella Donna and Stevie's personal comments over each video. My disappointment is with the CD: A) Some classic songs are missing here, such as OUTSIDE THE RAIN and BEAUTY & THE BEAST; B) STAND BACK: This original version has already been included in Time Space and in the Enchanted Box Set. It should have been replaced by the live version with the Melbourne Symphony, recorded during the Australian Gold Dust Tour; C) ROCK AND ROLL: A classic song, immortalized by Led Zepplin. OK, it's one of Stevie's favorite songs, she is great singing it but, it's not one of Stevie's songs; D) EDGE OF SEVENTEEN: Last but not least, and most importantly, this live version is by far one of the best and most powerful versions of that song, Stevie is absolutely fantastic, everything is perfect, except for... at least 2 minutes of the original live recording are missing here. I found this unacceptable!! I just hope now a DVD from the Gold Dust Tour would be released... Finally, all things considered this collection still couldn't be rated less than five stars, after all Stevie's works are always the best! A \\"must-have\\" item for all Stevie's fans.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Buy it. Don't hesitate, just do it. My only beef about the DVD is that it spends too much time focussing on Kenny, while the other folks are why we are watching.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|Not only is everything illuminated, but the glow from this movie also provides warmth and, at times, deep heat.  The acting is so understated that this might be a video diary - a sign of truly wonderful performances.  This is a film with only a nominal protagonist.  There are a core of protagonists, or perhaps the film is the protagonist - itself an almost autistic Proust, where the concrete realities of experience are bagged and tagged, not because they are dead, but because they are so alive.  Somewhere I read that the past is too much with us, but perhaps we are not with it enough.  This movie cannot be captured in a review - everyone I know who has seen it makes a different meaning from it.  All a reviewer can do is recommend it.  When you don't want a chick flick, or a screwball comedy, or a romantic comedy, or a coming of age movie, nor an action-adventure, sci-fi or horror flick, but you want to taste life in a lingering reflection right about where the bitter meets the sweet, you could do much worse.  This is one of the few movies in which virtually every character changes, even those doing the viewing.
0761536434|3.0|Not for the casual retro fan.  This book goes deep - deep into the personal ins and outs of the early video game history.  Would be better if there are more photos spread over the book.  In all, a good read about the people rather than the actual games.
B000NA2776|4.0|This is the kind of pop that polarizes. The flamboyant Mika creates the kind of sugary pop that just begs for radio play, but gets slagged off for it's utter lack of 'edge' or grit. Lovers of unaffected pop will lap this up like sugared cream, but many will find it too fey. As for me, I just can't keep from snapping up hookfests like \\"Grace Kelley\\" and the weirdly unironic \\"Lollipop.\\"<br /><br />Yet there is a great deal of inventiveness here. \\"Any Other World\\" is a great ballad, and the quirky \\"Grace Kelley\\" is worthy of George Michael. He is also more than a little out. \\"Billy Brown\\" is about a man2man relationship and makes no bones about it. But as the lack of commercial success afforded the wonderful pair of albums from Scissor Sisters  shows, \\"Life In Cartoon Motion\\" has a slim chance of getting heard outside people who fetishize this kind of precociousness.<br /><br />So if any of the following ring bells in your musical subconscious:<br /><br />Freddy Mercury<br /><br />Abba<br /><br />Elton John at his most glam<br /><br />George Michael/Wham<br /><br />Scissor Sisters<br /><br />or any other shamelessly pop act of that ilk...<br /><br />then Mika's giddy, infectious debut will make you float on a hot fudge sundae of PopMusic.

B0000019PA|5.0|I cannot help but feel this is the most _indie_ album in my collection. Each song, in general, uses little more than an acoustic guitar and carefully paced vocals, yet each song attains an atmosphere and, in some cases, intensity not easily achieved even with more complex instrumentation. For instance, the first track 'The King of Carrot Flowers' begins with an oh-so simple acouatic guitar strum, yet the tight rhythm and easy flow of the chord progression is immediately enticing. Add to this the somewhat oblique lyrics (which fit the style of music and vocal delivery to a tee), and a brilliant building structure culminating in the second part of the track, and you have a veritable tour de force in the first two songs!<br /><br />The stark and deliberately simplistic nature of the music could be offputing, but there is actually a fair deal of diversity and the unexpected present here. 'Oh Comely' my favourite track, does begin with the trademark acoustic strum, yet unfolds into so much more over eight minutes, with horns, vocal crescendos and sparse interludes all incorporated. Also, the suprisingly rocking 'Ghost', the excellent untitled instrumental (which revamps certain musical themes from throughout the album) and the dreamy psych of 'Communist Daughter' complement the more conventional 'Two Headed Boy' the title track, and 'Holland, 1945'.<br /><br />What I want to get across then is the fact that, even though the musiacl approach is almost deliberately simplistic, and the lyrics rambling and nebulous, the sheer weight of songwriting here carries the whole thing through. The record is just unbelievably consistent, the melancholy, slightly deranged atmosphere is unique and interesting, and the songs have an insular, personal quality that ensures they are very endearing. So yes, I think it's a classic.

B000I2IT44|5.0|Es sencillo explicar por qué, desde hace más de un año, me he obsesionado con esta banda inglesa: porque en ella encuentro el compendio definitivo de aquello que más amo del rock: una composición sólida pero sorprendente, letras agresivas pero coherentes, una ejecución brillante pero apasionada. Todo ello se ve corroborado con este concierto en directo, donde la banda lidereada por Steven Wilson (voz y guitarra) demuestra que es capaz de superar, con energía y entrega, la exquisita sofisticación de sus grabaciones de estudio. Las texturas del tecladista Richard Barbieri, la virtuosa cadencia del bajista Colin Edwin, las voces y los riffs de John Wesley y, sobre todo, la impresionante batería de Gavin Harrison, que con sus tambores y platillos nos hace retumbar el corazón y orbitar la mente. Un concierto que puede disfrutarse, a todo volumen, una y otra vez, y que nos muestra a un grupo que conoce y renueva la tradición musical del rock: un ensamble musical tan duro como Tool, tan dulce como Queen, tan alucinatorio como Pink Floyd y tan complejo como King Crimson. Verdaderamente memorables resultan las interpretaciones de \\"Hatesong\\" y \\"Heartattack in a Layby\\". Lamento solamente que no hayan incluido en este DVD tres de las canciones más originales y definitorias del grupo: \\"Shesmovedon\\", \\"Strip the soul\\" y \\"Radioactive Toy\\". Por lo demás, aquí se compendia una música tan pesada que nos hace levitar, y tan etérea que termina aterrando. Rock total, ni más ni menos. Rock total, señoras y señores.

David Downes has done an incredible job to showcase the individual and collective talents of these women. <br /> <br />I own both the CD and DVD and the CD produces a sound quality, transparency and depth not found in many current recordings and sounds fantastic in my audiophile stereo system.  I just wished it had the same number of songs as the DVD.  I prefer the sound on the CD because the music accompaniment is more subdued which I think suite the vocals better. <br /> <br />Celtic Woman has renewed my interest in great female vocals that I started listening again to recordings by Joni Mitchell, Jennifer Warnes, Sarah Brightman, Holly Cole, etc.  I'm also in the process of ordering recordings by new artists named Hayley, Lisa, Chloe and Meav. <br />

B000KQGP2G|5.0|_Scarsick_, in it's entirety, will forever remind me of rainy early mornings, during one of the most ambiguous periods of my life. Does this fact alone mean it merits five stars? No. But I cannot help feeling that there is a ceratin deep sadness, some sort of intangible melancholy present here, that reviewers thus far haven't really touched on or grasped, and that ensures this album (and, indeed, _BE_ before it) deserve far more appreciation. Now, don't get me wrong. Musically, I do feel that this is pretty much the weakest POS album. It doesn't have the emotional depth, staggering complexity or consistency or _Remedy lane_. It doesn't tackle weighty themes in an interesting, unconventional and challenging way like TPE. It doesn't have the grandstading ecelecticism of _Entropia_. Some of the songwriting leaves a bit to be desired. 'America', while being great fun and catchy, is, let's be honest, just silly. I actually really like 'Diso Queen' but it isn't much of a stretch for me to understand why others certanly wouldn't. 'Mrs Modern Mother Mary' is somewhat repetetive. And so on.<br /> Despite this, I have my doubts. None of their albums are entirely perfect (though RL comes close). 'Spitfall' is visceral, exciting, has a great chorus, and actually works spectacularly well as an ironic pastiche. 'Kingdom of Loss' is eerie, melancholy, and very affecting. 'Idiocracy' is a real highlight. 'Enter Rain' retains many elements of their classic sound, has an utterly gorgeous middle section, and Gildenlow's vocals just shine all over it. And so on.<br />Yet each time I hear the astounding ending to the title track, I am reminded of what I can't grasp anymore, and the combination of the music and the memory creates something no-one else can have. Perhaps my love for this album is filtered through nostalgia and distorted by comparison then. In places though, I find _Scarsick_ profound, enaging and utterly, utterly beautiful. Is that enough reaon to give it five stars? Well, yeah. Plus, my Mum really likes it (?).lus, my Mum really likes it (?).
B000002IM7|5.0|This was the debut album for Doug Pinnick, Ty Tabor and Jerry Gaskill, henceforth known as King's X. They would acquire a cult like following from this albums release that stands still today.<br />The truly great thing about this album is the fact that, when hair bands were spewing the same old crap that people seemed to eat up because it was always on the radio, these guys took it upon themselves to create a new version of the genre.<br />Out of the Silent Planet is a rock/funk/jazz and blues without the horns fusion that broke new ground. I would compare it to the genius of Steely Dan in the 70's, when they took the classic rock sound and added jazz/blues/soul to create their own sound.<br />Harmonies on vocals are the earmark of King's X. These guys were born to sing together. Jerry (drummer) and Ty (guitar) have the perfect voices to blend in as backup to Doug's (bass) soulful, low key bluesy sound.<br />The standouts on the album are: \\"In The New Age\\" which has one of the coolest bass lines I have ever heard, \\"Goldilox\\" which is a love song of sorts, \\"King\\" which was an early sign of their ability to play on words brilliantly, \\"Shot Of Love\\" which uses harmony like only the Beatles could do before.<br />Remaining songs on the album are strong at least. This is a stand-up, take no prisoners, this is who we are, welcome to King's X album and they don't apologize.<br />Thankfully, they didn't quit. Almost 20 years later, they are still going strong.<br />A great intro album and a must have.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|I have to start out by saying that as an avid movie watcher I generally try to keep an open mind when approaching a movie.  With that being said there are a couple of directors that I find this to be a particularly hard task to succeed in, Quentin Tarentino is one such director and the other is Spike Lee.  I have to say that whenever either of these two critically acclaimed directors releases a movie (or a `joint' as Spike Lee prefers to label them), I find it difficult to get too excited about seeing them, and sometimes I don't end up seeing the movie at all, though I try to make an effort because you never know when one might hit you just right.  So, when I saw the trailer for the upcoming Spike Lee movie \\"Inside Man\\" starring Denzel Washington and Clive Owen, I was somewhat interested in it simply because I enjoy both actors' work; however, Denzel had done a Spike Lee movie before that I didn't like, so that didn't guarantee that I would enjoy him in this one.  Over time I saw more trailers for the movie and read what the film was to be about and I have to say that for the first time ever, I was actually excited to see a Spike Lee movie, but whether my anticipation was misplaced or completely justified would remain to be seen. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Man\\" presents us with the story of a brilliant criminal mastermind (Clive Owen) who has devised the perfect bank robbery and subsequent escape without being caught by the law.  However, when the plan is hatched events quickly begin to spiral out of control and the police are fast on the scene led by a cunningly smart detective (Denzel Washington) who will not rest until the situation is contained.  Just when negotiations are beginning to take shape between the criminals and the police, a government power broker (Jodie Foster) interferes throwing this delicate matter into a state of uncertainty where one wrong move could spell disaster for all involved. <br /> <br />After watching this movie I quickly came to the conclusion that even though I generally dislike most Spike Lee movies, even he can surprise me sometimes.  \\"Inside Man\\" was a wonderfully constructed cat-and-mouse thriller that was completely engrossing and a genuine surprise to me, and was by far the most mainstream Spike Lee movie to date.  The story was well paced, full of twists-and-turns that you don't see coming, and the dialogue was so well-written and at times an absolute joy to listen to, especially the many exchanges between Denzel Washington and Clive Owen's characters.  The acting was terrific from all actors involved, each actor was given so much to work with, which is often a rarity in an ensemble piece like this one, where there are so many A-list actors gathered in one film, generally one or two of them get shorted on development.  A lot of the fun I had in watching this movie was trying to figure out the various motives every character had or which side they were truly on, so many of the characters had hidden agendas you really didn't know what to expect from any of them, which made the experience all the more enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />As I said earlier I'm not by any means a Spike Lee fan and enjoying this movie doesn't change that fact, but for me to have been even remotely entertained by this film is a feat in and of itself.  With all that being said, I think it would be nice to see more independent-type directors, such as Spike Lee or Quentin Tarentino, make more mainstream films and maybe, just maybe, I would like their work a whole lot more than simply one movie here and there. <br /> <br />\\"Inside Man\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B00009P1O5|4.0|I remember somebody putting this on the boom box while we were playing basketball the park, circa 1982.  I had a new respect for that guy after that. <br /> <br />This is a great album. <br />Not only is it a great album, it is Neil Young's greatest album. <br />It may the greatest album of all time. <br /> <br />Seriously, considering all of the misses that Neil released, how can you complain about this one?  T-Bone is primal beauty.   <br /> <br />I would much rather listen to this than, say, `Are you passionate' or half the catalog that followed.  <br />
B000KCHZK6|3.0|I love an album that I can sing to and enjoy the sound of the music- This fits the bill on most of the songs.  I love her last album- was hoping for another one of those-not quite, but still good. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|From \\"The Only Band That Matters\\" comes the only album that matters. Possibly the greatest rock album since...ever? The band accomplishes it all in this album: hard rock, counter-point, chorale, sonata form, avant-garde, and more. Though I have frequent addictions to Hail to the Thief, I keep coming back to this album. The variety of guitar tones is very rich. The percussion picks up where the guitars leave off, and the bass drives each song with intent, always there and never in the way. The use of electronics is masterful; not wedged and out of place or overbearing. As always, Thom's voice is eerily beautiful and innocent at the same time. The hook for me with this album and every other Radiohead album, is there use of harmony. It is very rich and the part leading, though unconventional to dissonant is always right. On the occasion that they do decide on unornamented progressions with authentic or plagal cadences, the result is not tired or overused.
B000001FKY|5.0|\\"Hysteria\\" is, quite frankly, one of the greatest rock albums ever created.  It doesn't take much to back up this claim.  It produced multiple hits which include \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me,\\" \\"Rocket,\\" and \\"Armageddon It.\\"  It put Def Leppard on the map in the United States and it crossed multiple genre boundaries with its songs played on hard rock stations, pop stations, and even AC airwaves.  People are still talking about this album today.  There are very few people walking around who haven't heard of at least one of the songs on this album.  They may not know the band's name or even the name of the album, but they do recognize the songs.<br /><br />If you've never heard this album before, please listen to it.  Def Leppard is one of a limited number of bands to crawl out of the late 80's who had a distinctive and easily recognizable sound.  Def Leppard was one of the loudest and heaviest of the hair bands AND they managed to crank out some wonderful ballads that have managed to stand the test of time as well.<br /><br />This particular album includes the aforementioned tunes as well as the wonderful title track, the anthemic \\"Women,\\" rockers such as \\"Animal\\" and \\"Gods of War,\\" and slower tracks like \\"Love and Affection.\\"  I guarantee you that there is something on this disc for everyone.  From raunch to romance, \\"Hysteria\\" has all of the bases covered.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005R1N3|5.0|The first time I saw it was a year or two after it came out.  I was a teenager and had never seen anything that scary.  This was, remember, several years before the genre of the teenage slasher flick first appeared. <br /> <br />One of the creepiest and most effective things about this movie is that you never got to see the face of the killer.  There was never a reason given for what he did, and you had no idea who he was.  It was just some lunatic who got into the house through a window,  No other explanation given.  Not many scripts or stories have the guts to pull this off. <br /> <br />Once the maniac gets in, he begins a series of chilling, sickening and utterly terrifying phone calls to the sorority girls in the house, who are in the midst of a Christmas party.  You realize, when listening to this psycho, that whatever is wrong with him is beyond a prank, beyond mental illness.  This person is unbelievably twisted and deranged.  The ability he has to shift his voice patterns and imitations, not to mention his hoarse, guttural and violent thrusts when he shouts are what let you know how unspeakably horrifying it is going to be for the parties involved. <br /> <br />The girls have a range of emotions, from frightened, amused, and, provocation, which is a mistake. <br /> <br />A side story of a missing, later found murdered child in a park lends to the growing terror.  A race against time while police try and track the calls from inside the house adds to the tension. <br /> <br />There is no satisfying, feel-good ending. <br /> <br />The great touches in this movie come fom everything you do not see, but from what is inferred.  There is almost no blood in the movie.  You do get to see several murders, but the murders themselves are almost beside the point.  Its the heart-pounding fear leading up to it that makes the movie worth seeing.  None of the slasher movies that followed can touch this one.  What a forgotten piece of work. <br /> <br />Hands down one of thebest scary movies ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0143038419|3.0|After reading and enjoying the book, I went on line to see what others thought about it.  I am so surprised by the extremes on both ends.  I just thought it was a mostly enjoyable read.  I thought India got tiresome, like she ran out of real material and had to stretch to get her three equal parts concept.   <br />I'm sorry to be negative, but cannot believe that anyone who reads much would find it to be \\"the best book\\" they ever read.  People who find it life-changing and enlightening,too, must not have spent much time on thinking in depth on spirituality. <br />By the same token, folks who gave it a one-star with scathing criticism-what were you expecting.  No, it's not great literature, nor is it very intellectual.  Just a fun little romp.  Does every book have to be so much more?
B00005LC1H|5.0|It's a real shame this series wasn't afforded a decent run because, had it been, I really believe Fawlty Towers would have become one of the greatest British comedy shows ever, right up there with John Cleese's old show at Monty Python.<br /><br />My favorite episode is \\"The Builders.\\"  The one part that leave my sides hurting from laughing so hard is the one where Sybil Fawlty comes back to find that O'Reilly's workmen have screwed up yet again (this after already hiring a competent, yet expensive, contractor to do the work).  Mr. O'Reilly claims that he, \\"...likes a woman with spirit,\\" to which Sybil responds with, \\"Oh, do you?  Is that what you like?\\"  Mr. O'Reilly assures her, enthusiastically responding, \\"I do! I do!\\" Sybil: \\"Oh good.\\"  She then proceeds to whack her husband in the stomach with an umbrella and then starts beating the living daylights out of O'Reilly while she says, \\"Come on, then, give us a smile.\\"  With O'Reilly crouched against the check-in desk Sybil proclaims: \\"I've seen better creatures than you lying on their backs at the bottom of ponds.\\"<br /><br />Fawlty Towers is British comedy, and comedy in general, at its best.  John Cleese's comedic timing and delivery are on-target (as always), and I'm really sorry to see there are only so many episodes to this fantastic comedy.  - Donna Di Giacomo
B000NVIXDW|4.0|My first reaction to \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" was, \\"This is what we've waited two years for?\\"  Not that it's a bad album, it simply didn't strike me as particularly memorable or the kind of masterpiece that would need that long a gestation period.  On further listenings, however, it's growing on me.  The formula here is pretty much the same as on Buble's previous two albums:  Mix established standards with some second-rate rock/pop songs given the Cocktail Lounge treatment, while throwing in an original song or two for good measure.  Some tracks are more successful than others, which is to be expected.  I find Leonard Cohen's \\"I'm Your Man\\" both creepy and cheesy (what the hell is this \\"beast\\" the lyric keeps on about?), and \\"Always On My Mind\\" doesn't quite survive (or warrant, for that matter) Sinatra-ization.  But \\"I've Got the World On a String\\" is just glorious, as is \\"Me and Mrs. Jones.\\"  And just try getting \\"Everything\\" out of your head or off \\"repeat\\" on your iPod; it's an instant classic.  Throughout, Buble sounds terrific; so much better than Matt Dusk, Robbie Williams, or a half-a-dozen other crooner wannabees out there.  Michael Buble is the real deal, and it's very nice to have him back.  How about one of these a year, Mike?
0374105235|4.0|\\"A Long Way Gone\\" tells the story of the adolescence of Ishmael Beah, who is (we can presume by now) a naturalized American born in Sierra Leone.  The story starts in January 1993, when Beah was twelve years and two months old and lived with his mother and older brother in south-central Sierra Leone.  It ends in November 1997 with his flight from the capital city, Freetown, towards the nearby Guinean border after serving in the Sierra Leonean army for over two years.  Ishmael was at that time a few weeks short of his seventeenth birthday.  A biography on the dust jacket informs the reader that he arrived in the United States the following year. <br /> <br />There are two things I need to say immediately following up that paragraph.  Number one, Ishmael was not deserting from the army, not that we would really blame him if he did.  Number two, he did not decide to go to the United States simply because he knew (much less everybody he knew knew) that it was the best country on earth.  In fact, he had been here during the time frame covered in the book.  We'll go into number two after we've beat number one to death. <br /> <br />What we begin to understand late in the book's second act is that Ishmael's war experience was very different from that of nearly all of, say, the soldiers now serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  To keep him hooked on war, the army kept him hooked on drugs (in addition to showing him a lot of bad Hollywood actioners).  The end of the war, a return to civilian life, even rotating out of the provinces most affected by the fighting, were impossible for him to conceive; the war was literally his only reality.  At no time during his service could Ishmael anticipate anything beyond the next attack he and his fellow soldiers, themselves mostly about his age, would be called upon to make.   <br /> <br />I don't have time to say everything I'd like to (and would on another site) about Ishmael's story itself, so I will skip to point two.  After many months of detox (apparently without the Twelve Step ideology that permeates such efforts in English-speaking countries), Ishmael was placed with a distant relative (his entire immediate family having been killed at the end of the first act).  Thereafter, he and one other adolescent veteran were chosen to represent Sierra Leone at a 1996 World Children's Parliament organized in New York City by the United Nations.  Like anybody coming to the United States for the first time, Ishmael was bewildered by what he saw, first off by the weather (he arrived in November), but later by everything else.  He met the woman who would later legally adopt him, Laura Simms, who worked with children for the United Nations, helping them tell their stories. <br /> <br />I am not going to tell you exactly why Ishmael flees the capital -- I want you to read the book, after all.  Suffice to say that this book reminded me somewhat of James Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" although Frey was never forced to kill anyone.  As Frey did in \\"Pieces,\\" I suspect Ishmael embellishes at some points.  That in itself, however, won't stop me from reading the sequel (I also read \\"My Friend Leonard\\").  If I were Ishmael I would start with my arrival in America for the second time, and end with September 11, 2001.  As a refugee from a country engulfed by chaos, I suspect he had a similarly unique perspective on the events of that day.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Heard mutterings about this BBC drama over the years and finally decided to check it out.  I thought I'd watch an episode a night, but couldn't tear myself away and hit the hay about midnight, my head full of the characters in this wonderfully complete adaptation.  It's the best BBC drama I've ever seen, and I say this having spent 30-odd years watching Masterpiece Theatre.  There are no slow moments, no plot weaknesses, each character is crystal clear, the cinematography is inspiring, and the acting is first-rate.  They really got the casting right on this one, right down to  Denby-Ashe's pillowy wide-eyed \\"southern\\" face contrasting with Armitage's dark, sharp, calculating \\"northern\\" countenance.  They are perfect, the film is perfect, and I can't recommend it more.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've never seen the television series Firefly everyone is talking about, but, I found this movie to be very interesting.    I would say it's similar to star wars without the light swords.  The human race doesn't exist only on earth. There is a galactic alliance and the government is training human children to be the \\"perfect weapon\\" using brainwashing and mind control.  One girl is rescued by her brother who breaks in to save her only to find they would spend much of their life running from an assassin.  What does this girl know that the government is  trying to hide?  Can they make it to the outer planet without getting attacked and eaten alive by the human consuming reevers?  Will her secret be exposed for the whole world to know the truth?  Watch and see...it really is a good movie.  (Serenity is the name of the ship.)
B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch's story-telling and directing are unparalleled and unique.  What is important about this film is that it depicts a certain truth that no other film has ever achieved: DEPICTS THE SUPERNATURAL STRANGENESS OF GOING TO THE SUPERNATURAL \\"OTHER SIDE\\" for fame and fortune.  Expert landscaping of Hollywood, covering Mind Control, Handlers, controllers, where power comes from, the satanic system and how it is propagated...    More important, Lynch shows what happens to people who rebel once they have sold their souls.      I believe that Lynch here is a prophet screaming in the wilderness about a reality that he knows--now he can't just outright tell you.  So he disguises much of it in confabulistic imagery and metaphor...but for those who know, IT IS THE REAL THING.      I am surprised they released it, but Lynch fooled them.  If you want to know how it works in Hollywood from a supernatural-mind-control-soul scalping perspective...see it.  As for the sex... it's psycho-sex... not gratuitous sex... everything in this film advances the plot, the point of which is: YOU CANNOT WIN. No one wins in Hollywood.  You just prolongue losing.      There are several versions of the devil depicted in the film--all of whom run Hollywood and all of whom are the same character.  See if you can spot them.  Hint. One resides outside by the dumpster of Mr. Winkie's diner, ruling the world. The other is a cowboy.  In my opinion, these are all the same Person.        I'll leave it right there.  I think the film is required viewing for any serious film buff interested in Hollywood and how it works.

0618680004|1.0|As a fellow scientist I have great respect for Dawkins ability to popularize complex ideas. Who can forget &#34;THE SELFISH GENE&#34;?! His ideas used to come across crystal clear and redolent with logical symmetry. And I think that he is long overdue for the Nobel Prize for his introduction of the notion of memes. I am afraid though that he bit the forbidden fruit for a scientist: Star System.<br /><br />The huge success and popularity he enjoyed for his previous books obviously addicted him to public recognition and with every new book he tries to titillate the media into turning him into an even bigger Star. His ideas get more and more provocative - sadly, mostly to provoke. From the air-time he gets, I would say he has the moves down pat.<br /><br />He might be an Oxford Biologist, and an excellent one at that, yet the territories he endeavors here are not Biology. For, any Biologist never forgets that we humans, are nothing more than metazoans, groups of cooperating animal cells. So are birds, butterflies and dogs. Birds can appreciate music, butterflies color patterns, whereas dogs can learn tricks. Yet they cannot comprehend simple algebra. We humans can do all of the above (and much more), nevertheless, there is no reason whatsoever our abilities to be unlimited. Actually, the opposite has been proven to be true.<br /><br />Case in point: we fail to comprehend the illusion of time. Our brain separates our consciousness into memories (past), present (lasting about 3sec) and imagination (future). The arrow of time is but a human shortcoming. Even its most modern definition (as the increase of entropy) only replaces the einsteinian &#34;observer&#34; or the classic &#34;clock&#34; with a humanly measurable change. We do incorporate time into our physical laws - only because that is how we perceive and are able to measure the phenomena they describe. Modern physics acknowledges, however, that time is but a human-brain artifact.<br />So, Plato had nailed it 2,500 years ago: we can only perceive the shadows of the true universe as it is reflected in the cave of our finite, animal intellect.<br /><br />Surprisingly, for a scientist he confines himself within...religious arguments.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|In the late 1970s, Dire Straits was a band that built a strong following.  Much of Dire Straits was the result of the awesome guitar work of Mark Knopfler, but there was also some great instrumentation from other band members such as drummer Pick Withers and bassist John Illsley.. In many circles, Knopfler is considered as good as they come. For Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the time of the  \\"British Invasion\\". In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way - a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country. Knopfler also proven himself to be a top-notch lyricist - writing both humorous and serious songs. The combination of outstanding instrumentation, great lyrics and a mix of old-fashioned Rock genres is really what made Dire Straits such a great band. .   The achieved success with their debut album - the self-titled Dire Straits.    Although, their follow-up album \\"Communiqué\\" followed up, many consider that album not as strong as \\"Dire Straits\\".    For the band's third album, \\"Making Movies\\", some changes would take place - and as a result it would become what many consider to be one of the strongest albums in the Dire Straits portfolio. <br /> <br />On the first two albums, many feel that Dire Straits had a more stripped down basic classic Rock sound.  For \\"Making Movies\\", things changed.   It would be on this album where we would see Dire Straits move toward more-complex arrangements.  This trend would actually continue on the album that would follow \\"Making Movies\\" - 1982's \\"Love Over Gold\\".   \\"Making Movies\\" would make a major personnel change in that Mark Knopfler's brother, David would depart the band.   At the same time, the band would bring in the E Street Band's Roy Bittan to play keyboards.   Bittan has one of the most distinctive keyboard sounds in the music business and it often is easy to identify his work.It is Bittan's unique style combined with the outstanding guitar work and music arrangements of the band that helped \\"Making Movies\\"s easily emerge as the band's signature sound to date. <br /> <br />There are seven tracks that make up the \\"Making Movies\\" album.  Here is a track by track review: <br /> <br />\\"Tunnel of Love\\":  This is the opening track of the collection and has easily become one of the band's classic tracks.   The song opens with an arrangement of a melody from Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"Carousel\\".    As the song progresses into the \\"Rock portion\\", you will first hear Bittan's trademark keyboards followed by Mark Knopfler's trademark guitar. This song presents a great narrative as Knopfler reminisces about his younger days at an amusement park.  Overall, this song just seems to capture the signature style that Dire Straits has really garnered a reputation for.  I saw one review say that this song this song is \\"everything that was great about these guys condensed in 8 minutes\\" - I couldn't agree more.  <br /> <br />\\"Romeo and Juliet\\":  As the title says, this is basically a song about Romeo and Juliet.   Here we get Knopfler's unique take and spin on this classic William Shakespeare work.   Knopfler displays humor when he says, \\"Juliet says 'hey it's Romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack'\\".  At the same time Knopfler gives his perspective on the whole story when he says (from Romeo's point of view), \\"Juliet the dice were loaded from the start\\".  More great instrumentation - especially from Bittan and Knopfler help complete the picture of this story. <br /> <br />\\"Skateaway\\": This is a sometimes overlooked song, but nonetheless still a Dire Straits classic.   This song might seem simple, yet it demonstrates some of the terrific arrangements by the band.   The song paints a picture of a girl at a roller skating rink.   Yet the part that really is interesting is how Knopfler tells the story of the girl listening to music on a portable music player (probably a Walkman).   The lyrics \\"she gets rock n roll a rock n roll station; and a rock n roll dream; she's making movies on location\\" tell the story perfectly.  Listen to how Knopfler creates a sound that gives you a feel of the roller rink.   At the same time, listen to how the music \\"changes up\\" throughout the song.  Bittan's keyboards shine as well - you will definitely pick out his classic sound. <br /> <br />\\"Expresso Love\\": This is another classic Dire Straits song.  It also starts out with some great keyboards by Bittan and like \\"Tunnel of Love\\", this progresses into a classic Dire Straits song.   Knopfler's guitar chords will have you jamming them over and over again. <br /> <br />\\"Hand in Hand\\":  This song takes a softer sound when compared to most of the other tracks on this collection.   In some ways this reminded me a bit of Dan Fogelberg.  In this song, there is a slight country-like sound - and this is something that would become an influence on Knopfler's influence later in his musical career. <br /> <br />\\"Solid Rock\\": This is the shortest track on the album, but that doesn't impact anything.   This song has a Southern-Rock feel and in some ways, Knopfler's vocals reminded me of Tom Petty.  Knopfler's guitar will be the primary star of this song.  In this song Knopfler sings about living a safe and conservative kind of life as he sings \\"Well i'm sick of potential; I'm sick of vanity now\\".  This is another terrific song. <br /> <br />\\"Les Boys\\":  This song was a most unorthodox song.    It basically pokes fun at the female impersonators in the cabaret.   The lyrics \\"Les boys got leather straps....get dressed up get a little risque\\" tell the whole story.   This song does a great job at creating that cabaret feel to it. <br /> <br />The liner notes include all of the lyrics.  Overall, this song exemplifies the classic Dire Straits sound. If one has any interest in Dire Straits at all, this would be the album I recommend getting. <br />
B00065MDRW|4.0|This album is a classic, as far as I am concern, this is one of their best of the seventies, my other choice would be \\"Red\\". I am not a fan of the band (see my other reviews) but I really like this one, it has what was clearly missing in the following albums and that is....emotion. <br />This cd is full of great melodic and emotionnal moments, I just like this album.
B000K15VSA|5.0|The previous DVD versions never included the original theater release. That is why I have held onto my VHS copy for so long. One can only hope that the original release will be included in the Essential 25th Anniversary Collection now called the Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition which may change again by release time. It is suppose to, but then from what I have heard it still will not include the original Vangelis score. I can certainly appreciate the Directors Cut [[ASIN:B000HC2LIK Blade Runner - The Director's Cut (Remastered Limited Edition)]], I just happen to prefer the theater released version. I like Deckard's narrative throughout the movie, sometimes referred to as Film Noir, and the scene of him and the girl flying away to Canada with some great scenery and music at the end. It seemed a little less dark with a bit more hope at the conclusion. I will snap this up in a heartbeat if this is the theater release. If it is another directors cut only release I will tell them to bite me. If you like the Director's cut that is fine, I'm glad you have what you want. Don't criticize us if we want something that was taken from us. If you have seen a movie in the theater and then seen it changed to something less, I can't believe you wouldn't want to have the full version. When George Lucas changed the original \\"Star Wars\\" it wasn't to take something away, but to add some special effects that he couldn't do originally. But I have to agree with a comment I got, they are still entitled to the original version as well. In the Blade Runner director's cut, dialogue and a scene are removed. No additions, just subtractions. So stop being critical of my review if I want the whole enchilada. By the way why don't we let the book critics weigh in on \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" while we're at it. I'm sure they will tell you neither movie version was like the book. Ask me if I care it wasn't the same as the book. I read to folks, but if I hold my breath till the movie = book, I will be dead much longer than the oldest pharoah has been.<br /><br />Three comments:<br /><br />One person pointed out that Ridley Scott was not responsible for the Director's Cut. You notice I never mentioned him in my review. I am aware the studio was behind it.<br /><br />A couple others pointed out they like the original \\"Star Wars\\", so do I, and I have to agree we are still entitled to the original version as well. That is kind of my whole argument here, everyone should be entitled to the original theater releases.<br /><br />Another person asked, \\"Why are we posting reviews already?\\". Fair question, now go look at reviews I posted at \\"Shoot to Kill\\", \\"The Enemy Below\\", \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\", et cetera. I posted them pre-release of DVDs to make sure there was a release. Do you think studios ignore these reviews? They do not. I regularly get invitations to write reviews at other sites and have spoken to some of the studios about planned releases. So I want to thank all the people posting reviews and voting here, it does make a difference.<br /><br />You folks complaining about our pre-reviews need to go work with the kids that like to brag about how they beat a game or quest by themsleves instead of giving useful information on where it was or how to beat it in reviews and forums all over the internet. Your lack of interest in pre-reviews serves no positive input to those of us that are interested to find out what we can about this upcoming release. I hope you realize when I first wrote this review it was but a dream to get the original release. All there was is a fill in your e-mail and we will let you know if and when this will come out on DVD. The name at that time was Blade Runner Definitive Release. There were no images here and certainly no details. So I hope that helps to show that the interest people took in this area I am sure played at least some part in making it happen. I want to thank all those that posted information as it became available for those of us that think pre-reviews are important. Saying you don't like pre-reviews is like saying, don't tell me that car is going to hit me. I don't want to know about the possible future. If that's the way you feel, why are you posting about a SciFi movie? As for those claiming these really aren't reviews, you will note the Amazon link says \\"Write Review\\", I think they know what they are even if you don't.think pre-reviews are important.

B000OCXM68|5.0|I fell in love with this CD at first listen! I'm sure you will, too!<br /><br />To make an impact on the ears of fine music aficionados, a singer has to have a great vocal style, an enormous talent and an innate passion. Michael Bubl&eacute;, without a doubt, possesses all these qualities. It's so impossible not to love and truly be impressed with the beauty of this latest offering from Mr. Bubl&eacute;, another one of his heartwarming and remarkable recordings.<br /><br />I first heard Michael Bubl&eacute; in 2003 over a radio station in L.A. singing \\"Moondance,\\" and that song turned me on to his gorgeous music and I was totally beguiled by his smooth voice, his great singing style, and of course his tasteful choice of material on all his recordings. And the rest is history. To date, I have most of his notable CDs added to my collection. I especially love the CD he recorded exclusively for Hallmark for its Valentine's Day offering, [[ASIN:B000ERIENE With Love, Michael Buble]], and of course his self-titled CD, [[ASIN:B000088E6D Michael Bubl&eacute;]], [[ASIN:B00070Q7VO It's Time]], and the Dual Disc/DVD[[ASIN:B0001IN07Q Come Fly With Me (CD & DVD)]].<br /><br />In this CD, the singer from Canada has illuminated the timeless songs of Johnny Mercer, Sammy Cahn, Henry Mancini, Jimmy Van Heusen, Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler, Cy Coleman, Eric Clapton, among others. He made each song breathe a new lease on life and gave each one a wonderful twist starting off with a sparkling version of John Clayton-arranged-track, \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\" down to dazzling \\"Dream.\\" I've never heard this Johnny Mercer classic interpreted in a most beautiful way until now. The charming arrangement was done by one of the greatest Sinatra arrangers of all-time, Johnny Mandel. The first time I heard it, I got goose bumps and chills up my spine! It reminds me so much of a legendary icon of a singer when he was younger. Many thanks to Johnny Mandel's brilliance and creativity in arranging superb and enchanting charts, and Michael Bubl&eacute;'s flawless rendition as well as the excellent instrumentation of the finest studio musicians for making this song so special and hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />My favorites include Johnny Mercer's \\"Dream\\" and Eric Clapton's \\"Wonderful Tonight,\\" which is a duet with Ivan Lins, a Brazilian singer/composer and well-known for his remarkable compositions such as \\"Love Dance\\" and \\"Velas.\\" Listen closely to its enthralling Bossa Nova arrangement by David Foster and Jorge Calandrelli (strings) and the mesmerizing guitar solo by Hector Pereira. The inclusion of its Portuguese lyrics adds an enchanting glow to this song. The Latin-infused version of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's \\"It Had Better Be Tonight\\" (\\"Meglio Stasera\\") is a joy to listen to. I'm also delighted with the title track, Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen's \\"Call Me Irresponsible,\\" one of the best tracks and one of my absolute favorite songs of all-time. Ditto with his swinging version of \\"I've Got The World On A String.\\" I love its additional background vocals . . . \\"Hey Michael, come on and swing, looks like you've got the world on a string.\\"<br /><br />Two original songs, \\"Lost\\" and \\"Everything\\" showcase the singer's talent as a songwriter. He co-wrote \\"Lost\\" with another promising Canadian singer Jann Arden, and pianist Alan Chang. I love \\"Everything\\" for its heartfelt lyrics and music with a nice contemporary flair - it's now one of my favorite new songs.<br /><br />\\"You're my carousel<br />You're my wishing well<br />And you light me up when you ring my bell<br />You're a mystery<br />You're from outerspace<br />You're every minute of my every day\\"<br /><br />The bonus track, \\"L-O-V-E\\" is one of Nat King Cole's signature songs that was given a new flair and style.<br /><br />My congratulations to Michael Bubl&eacute;, David Foster, Humberto Gatica, Johnny Mandel, Jorge Calandrelli, Don Sebesky, Bob Rock, John Clayton and all the musicians involved with this wonderful recording. I'm looking forward to your next project.<br /><br />Absolutely, totally and most definitely recommended for your listening enjoyment.<br /><br />P.S. I'd like to sincerely thank a friend of mine who has a generous heart for sending me this CD (and a couple more) after reading my reviews and my Wish List and who really likes the same kind of music I so love. I appreciate your kind gesture and your praises on my reviews!<br /><br />P.P.S. I can't wait to be at Michael's concert in L.A. this summer. I hope \\"Dream\\" will be on the repertoire.recommended for your listening enjoyment.    P.S.

B000001F75|5.0|This cd is the first famous album, (not the first but the third), you can here Mama nature said with the great slide guitar of Eric Bell, Slow blues, black boys on the corner, and the famous folk song whiskey in the jar.<br />very good record! The deluxe edition is very good because you can listen the bbc sessions and songs like showdown and suicide played by Eric Bell and with different lyrics, the out-take little darling and Sitamoia and much more...
B00064WSNM|1.0|I just can't listen to this album, I know many of you rate it as a masterpiece, but I don't.  The music has no emotion, just as cold as Mr. Fripp can be.  I don't fell anything when I am listening to it. <br />I consider myself as an open mind and I am always ready to discover new things, this album might have been \\"hot\\" thirty years ago, but it is very dated in the 21st century ! I gave mine to a friend, giving space in my cd collection for something else.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Normally I try to avoid attacking people's opinions on movies, because they're just that..opinions.  But, that having been said, I have noticed several bad reviews for this classic and I cannot sit still and take it.  This film was created at a time when audiences didn't need to have things jammed down their throats to enjoy a movie.  If Jaws was released today it would flop, and that shows you how dumbed down and lazy we have become in our movie preferences.  Everything from the music, cast, special effects, and limited viewing of the shark until near the end, is perfectly done.  How many other directors could create such fright and terror without showing you the \\"monster\\" until more than half-way through the film?  This movie actually made people think twice before swimming in the ocean.  It held a nation in fear of what lies beneath the ocean, and it is simply a masterpiece.  The first half leads perfectly into the conclusion, where three men are pitted on a boat against the \\"monster\\".  Think of how epic the screenplay was when you have Quint, Chief Brody, and Dreyfus on that rusty old clunker \\"Orca\\", battling Jaws.  The scene at night with the whales singing before the shark rams the boat is just haunting.  While I'm sure I will open myself to attacks from people who don't love this film, I will dare say it anyway.....You are either under 20 or have an IQ in the same range if you don't like this movie.  In the year 2050, Jaws will still be considered one of the top 10 greatest movies ever made.  You heard it here folks.  Don't tarnish the classics, it's like blasphemy.
0124297854|5.0|This book is like an epic of reaction mechanism. When I read the book for the first time, I was tried to think about the mechanisms only but gradually I realized that application of these name reactions are more important than to remember. Real life mechanism applications are hard, but I am sure, if anybody can remember some of them that they referenced in the book will be great. So in one word, this book is awesome book that I ever read for reaction mechanism.
B000LC4CVA|3.0|My response to the original Celtic Woman concert and recording was so enthusiastic (giving away copies to friends) that perhaps a sequel was bound to be a letdown. The orchestration was as beautiful as ever, as were the singers themselves, but I found the selection of music to be disappointing (Over the Rainbow?) after the notable hits in their first concert. The best numbers this time were the three repeats from their original recording (Oronoco Flow, Danny Boy and You Raise Me Up). I'm sorry to say that frequent costume changes and more of Mairead's energetic and beautiful fiddling couldn't compensate for an uninspiring repertoire.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" is a series I never got to watch while it was on TV. My beautiful wife really dislikes science fiction, and I would rather spend time with her than watch anything on TV. However, I am a big science fiction fan, so when my sweetheart  is otherwise occupied, I enjoy watching reasonably good sci-fi if it is available. But I would have never bothered with this series had it not been for an essay by one of my favorite authors (Orson Scott Card) praising the movie \\"Serenity\\" and by connection, the series \\"Firefly\\".<br />I first bought the movie and rather liked it, but wasn't getting something about it. Then recently while on a vacation I bought the complete \\"Firefly\\" series on DVD and just loved it! \\"Firefly\\" is exactly what you want in a sci-fi drama. Wonderfully acted, incredibly believable visually, and a very good story.<br /><br />Again it is a shame that the FOX network more than any other gets it right when choosing series, and then gets it so, so wrong when it comes to cancelling series. And in some cases about marketing DVD's, but I digress.<br /><br />If you enjoy sci-fi even a little bit, you should find \\"Firefly\\" a worthy investment of your time and money. And then ,after you have watched the series, watch the movie \\" Serenity\\", you will be glad you did!
1582701709|4.0|Loved it! So much, that I had started a business! FYI - The Video and the book are exactly a like... and I thought that the DVD was much more moving! You get to hear and see their passion about this theory.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I know I like the album, I just can't tell to what degree yet. Some songs like \\"The Larger Bowl\\" are immediately accessbile, while others have so many time changes and style mixtures they take awhile to appreciate. \\"The Way the Wind Blows,\\" for example, is a mixture of blues, folk and rock--and that's just one song! I definitely respect and appreciate the band's desire to grow and evolve--if I wanted to hear Moving Pictures again, I would listen to Moving Pictures and never buy another Rush record. I think \\"Armor and Sword\\" may be among their best work--the synthesis between music and lyrics is as seamless as any of their songs, and the emotional impact is simultaneously jarring, poignant and philosophical. Time will tell!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched Serenity after reading an essay by Orson Scott Card praising it as a sci-fi movie that is the way sci-fi movies should be. I liked it, but didn't get it on a level that I did after watching the series \\"Firefly\\" on DVD.<br /><br />So it is almost like it is two movies, on one hand it is a satisfying completion to a wonderful series that many people loved, (even those who like me missed it until after the movie), and on the other hand this is a very good allegory of a story about big government, and even a look at the dangers of psycho-pharmacology. And no, I am not against psycho-pharmacology in any way, but I am against the idea of the government having a say in how I choose to or not to medicate.<br /><br />In any case this is a visually stunning film, very well written, very well acted, with completely believable special effects.<br /><br />If you want an excellent sci-fi movie this is it, but do yourself a favor and watch the series first. You'll be glad you did.
B000002TQV|5.0|I am a long time fan so I may be a little bit biased when I say THE BENDS is a masterpiece. It is however. Many bands come and go, some just slowly fade away but Radiohead has managed to stick through a grunge era, making somewhat digestible music for the masses while retaining a creative, viable edge? They are one of the few bands around that I look forward to putting out a new CD. I'm not going to go into particulars, I'm a simple love it or hate it person and I don't like every song Radiohead puts out, just 99% of them. No band is perfect, but IMO these guys are as close as it gets. This album is on my must have list and a great one to start off with if you haven't followed this band. O.K. Computers is great as well but The Bends seems more accessable in my opinion.
B00002SWEM|4.0|Essential for anyone who loves music. Ry Cooder is to be complemented for his work in bringing the musicians together back then. I saw the BVSC live about 6 years ago, and it was one of the most amazing and inspiring performances I have ever seen. The movie is a bit slow in parts, and the music is somewhat brought down by Ry Cooder unfortunately. I have the greatest respect for him as a master guitarist (his other collaborations are outstanding) but here he looks hopelessly out of place as the BVSC chugs on with their amazing brand of rootsy lightness. Cooder sits around producing a melancholy wail once in a while from his slide guitar, and that's about it. Pity. But still, if you are into music - and particularly Latin music - you HAVE TO SEE this film :)
1582701709|3.0|These people had parts of the secret; but not the whole enchilada. <br /> <br />This book IS better than the Creative Visualization books because the secret uses visualization, emotions, AND faith. <br /> <br />This is all well and good, and it works to some degree; but there is more to it than these three parts of the secret. <br /> <br />I credit the author for getting as much of the secret as she did; but there is a critical part of the secret that is missing. That of consciously gathering additional energy (ch'i, ki, mana, prana and other names) and sending this energy to the higher powers to bring the prayer action into manifestation. <br /> <br />For the Higher powers to work on our behalf they need energy from this plane in order to work on our behalf on this plane. <br /> <br />The ones who knew all of the secret were the pre-Christian Hawai'ian kanunas dating back to around 14,000 years ago. <br /> <br />The people the author mentioned in the book and DVD only have fragments of the secret.
B000GYI32M|5.0|The O.C. is an unbelievable show. It is worth all of the waiting moments and all of the tears cried. All four of the seasons were awesome. I recomend all of them. After watching the episodes, you start to become obsessed. Anytime I turned on the O.C. it made my day! I HIGHLY reccomend the O.C. to any teenager! Although it was sad to see Marissa go, The show still was strong. I own all of the seasons (Except for 4..I'll get it in a couple of weeks) and I watch them all of the time over and over again. <br /> <br />Season 1 - A+++ <br />Season 2 - A <br />Season 3 - B+ <br />Season 4 - B
B000ICLRIE|4.0|what can I say about this film, even though its a bit long winded in places its still a masterpeace that really shows what Blu-ray can do. <br /> <br />but as for the film, well the comment above says it all but not everything yes they were right to cut out the fact that Eva Green in the film had a child, it just slows up the movie to a point where your wondering heck GET ON WITH IT, the rest that was cut however was just plain crazy theres such a deapth within the characters that you'll find yourself chearing for sela hadeen at one point in the movie, and authough some may not like it (like most of the male population) the romantic element that builds between the two main characters is truly hartwarming wheres the original realase was well vage at best, to the point where you feel they are on first date teritory. <br /> <br />Getting back to the Blu-ray, Extra's wise it still ranks down there with the first set of DVD's there's not a lot extra unless your into directors commentary, Picture wise when you blow it up to a 40 plus screen size you can really tell the difference especially when your display can do the full 1080P shi-bang, and sound well lets just say those extra bits a second really do show. (just hope you have understanding neighbours when those boulders start flying) <br /> <br />if you have an upscaler in your DVD player and were quite happy with the original realease then find a rental store who has a stock of blu-rays, if however if you have a butt made of iron who loves a good movie that your sure the critics must have had a bad print when it came to review day then add this to your wish list asap you won't be disapointed.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is another great one from Rush. But this one has grown on me faster than Vapor Trails (which took some time) but paid off. All tracks on this one are solid. All three instrumentals are as good as any that followed \\"YYZ\\". The albums seems to really hit its stride with \\"Spindrift\\". \\"Good News First\\" and \\"We Hold On\\" do sound like they could have been from Vapor Trails. \\"Faithless\\" and \\"Bravest Face\\" really give me a Rush. I've liked every Rush album, except Feedback, which doesn't really seem like something Rush should do. I guess cover albums just don't do it for me. They are still better than any of the newer groups out there.
B000IHY9UW|5.0|If you just want to have a good time and not worry about details related to biography, this is the perfect The Doors movie.
B00005JPFF|5.0|I have been waiting for this film to be released since I saw Spider-man 2 in theaters(opening day)! I read some of the reviews before seeing Spider-Man 3 and I was prepared for the worst. I am baffled!, and can not understand why some critics are trashing this film? I think they are being a little harsh and overreacting. There is a lot going on in this third installment, yet it never felt confusing or rushed. I was impressed how they were able to keep so many sub plots going without them becoming distracting. Considering the high expectations there were for this film, I think it is a complete success! There is no reason anyone should pass up going to see this movie! I know this, I laughed, I cried(well I shed a tear or two)and the action and FX are incredible! What more do you want from a comic book super hero movie? This could be the best trilogy ever made! Think about it....The Godfather 1 and 2 are great, but 3 is OK. Ditto \\"Star Wars\\" I know that a lot of Venom fans thought that there wasn't enough story devoted to that character, but I thought he was ingeniously worked it to the main plot and the movie moved along at the right pace. There will always be some changes when they bring comic characters to the screen. The FX have never looked better with much improved battle scenes than the first two films. I thought Spider-man  was the best with part 2 coming in at a close second. This might not be as good as Spider-Man 1 or 2, but it's close(and better than 95% of Superhero movies...so far)! It would be nice to see a director's cut of this film.
B00008G9JM|1.0|This is the most disjointed record I have ever heard. No cohesivness whatsoever. Just when you think It can't get any worse, they throw in a nursery ryme to make things really entertaining. A big Tull throwaway!
0439813786|5.0|I picked up this book because it was recommended by Amazon.com, and after reading the reviews, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well I wasn't disappointed. At first, I thought this would be a good read while I wait for the final Harry Potter book to be released. Because THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET is over 500 pages long, it seemed like a nice long read.<br /><br />Going to a book store with friends, I looked at the book and was surprised to see that more than 80% of it comprised of drawings. So I was thinking to myself that a book with so many illustrations must be lacking in a strong story...I was wrong.<br /><br />The story, which would equal about 70 or so pages (maybe less!) if printed in regular book form, centers around a small boy named Hugo Cabret. He loses his father in a freak accident and is sent to live with his drunken uncle in a Paris subway station. Soon after, his uncle disappears and Hugo is left to fend for himself. Everyday is a struggle for survival as he steals bread and milk from stores in the station, and continues to fix the clocks there--which was supposed to be his uncle's job. But as bleak as it may sound, Hugo manages to hold onto hope by becoming obsessed with an automaton that he believes will save his life, once he is able to fix it.<br /><br />I won't give anything away but I will say that this story is about hope, compassion, and dreams. No wonder so many people enjoyed it.<br /><br />As far as the format of the book, the many illustrations never compete with the story only compliment it. It really is like watching a movie. And the placement of text--some in regular format from top to bottom, while other pages contain only one paragraph--also contribute to the unusual form of this book, but never detract from the story.<br /><br />Will THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET book change or create a new form/genre in children's literature? Who knows, but I'm sure it will become a classic.
B0000029GA|5.0|This isn't a review.  Because this album doesn't need another one.  It's 2007, and by now everybody knows that Illmatic is like hip hop's religious text: this album is the essence of hip hop.  There isn't a single critic who's got anything bad to say about Illmatic...except, maybe, for how it sent Nas into a career slump afterwards.  So I'm just wondering why Amazon hasn't marked this \\"essential\\", like it's done for other classic albums.  Maybe there's some beauracracy behind giving an album that title on this site, I don't know.  But \\"Life After Death\\" over \\"Illmatic\\"???  I'm a huge fan of Big, but nooo way.
B000N6U0EC|2.0|For a review of the movie read the other comments. This Blu Ray version is terrible. It looks like it is in 480 plus it is grainy. This disc is just like the Click Blu Ray version. What is up with Sony pictures? Their blu ray discs look terrible. I did once talk to a sales rep at the Sony store and he told me that Sony Blu Ray producted discs would play through component and not only through HDMI. I guess the reason why is that their discs are not in 1080. Don't get the blu ray version, stick to standard.
B000H5U832|4.0|Product was as described and  did not have any skips and reload problems/ damaged disc indicators. <br />Shipment was on time. Package was undamaged.
B00008DDRX|5.0|To complain that LeMans is short on dialog is like criticizing a butterfly for not having a beak. It's taken more than 30 years, but Americans are finally beginning to appreciate what Europeans and ardent racing enthusiasts around the world have known since they first viewed LeMans: it's an excellent motor racing film.  This emerging realization is due to several things, I think. One is that over the past three decades, even the densest moviegoers have had to recognize McQueen's disdain for dialog in ALL of his films. Unlike actors who lobby to have additional lines written for their characters, McQueen preferred to act through gestures, expressions and body language. He was all about presence, and Michael Delaney exudes all the presence of Frank Bullitt and Thomas Crown.  Another reason for the growing respect for LeMans the movie is the comparative shallowness of the charade that passes for motor racing today.  LeMans was shot on the cusp of the corporatization of the sport. It was well on its way from a gentleman's pursuit, that train had left the station in the mid-1960s, but the earnings of world-class drivers when LeMans was made were still comparable with CEO, rather than rock-star compensation. Importantly,  it still took huge balls and a lot of ability to drive a car like the Porsche 917 the length of a 3.5 mile straightaway at 240 mph, at night, in the rain, like Vic Elford did in 1970.  Mulsanne has long since been shortened, the number of co-drivers on a single LeMans team has grown from two to your average college fraternity, and drivers need to bring a lot less to the game in terms of guts and skill than they did in 1970. LeMans is not without its blemishes, and by all accounts it was a nightmare of a project, but McQueen delivered what he said he would - a film that did justice to race drivers and racing.

067003830X|5.0|Norman Doidge's book is beautifully written and brings life and clarity to a variety of neuropsychiatric problems that affect children and adults.  With case histories that read like excellent short stories to illustrate each syndrome, Dr. Doidge outlines specific constellations of symptoms/problems and proceeds to describe the thought processes of the researchers who have dedicated their careers to addressing these syndromes.  It reads a bit like a science detective story and is fun. This very readable book manages to humanize an often baffling area of science and controversy.  It is aimed at the well-educated lay reader-you do not need a Ph.D. to benefit from the wisdom imparted here. <br /> <br />Barbara Milrod, M.D. <br />Associate Professor of Psychiatry <br />Weill Medical College of Cornell University
B000K15VSA|5.0|Reading some of the other reviews here, I'm pleased I'm not the only one who prefers the original version of the classic Sci-Fi movie, based on the Philip K. Dick story \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\".  I've waited for the theatrical-release version of this film on DVD forever to no avail and even VHS copies are becoming difficult to find.  When I saw the \\"Director's Cut\\", I was seriously disappointed.  The narrated version has a Film Noir feel that you just don't get in the later version.  Some find the narration cheesy and distracting, but for me it is what makes the film different and unique amongst others of the genre.  So my rating would be 5 stars for the original release and 3.5 stars for the later versions.  I'm glad they included the original film in this set, though it would be nice if there were a single-release DVD of it as well.  To spend so much for a five-disc set in order to get a high-quality copy of the first version is a shame.  There are so many different versions of this film now it's become insane, not to mention confusing.
B00005JPFF|4.0|I could already feel where Spider-Man 3 could have had problems before even seeing the movie. Too many characters, not enough character development, too long, you know something along those lines. Although 3 villains may seem like too many it didn't feel overcrowded. In this third segment Peter Parker deals with so much but don't fear because spidey appears or does Venom. In the beginning it's all about Peter Parker and how big his ego is getting.<br /><br />Everybody loves Spider-Man; he took care of his school and work problems, and best of all he has Mary Jane. What more could Peter ask for but during his short period of joy three things are in the process of attempting to destroy Spider-Man. The first is of course the New Goblin (Harry Osborn) who wants revenge for what Spider-Man did to his Father. The second being Flint Marko who just escaped from prison and eventually becomes the Sandman. Parker's third problem is that Venom just landed on earth and is looking for a host preferably a Spider-Man.<br /><br />A huge series of events occurs after these three including one at the end that is hard to believe but will excite many. After thinking about how the film began and ended I understand how some people feel. I think that Spider-Man 3 is an amazing movie but it will create problems for the Spider-Man films to come, that's if there will even be future films. So much drama is added to all these films because of Mary Jane and I imagine that her damsel in distress act will get old quick. Without her these films don't have much of a story or a heart, they wouldn't be able to have a deep story. They need something else other than Mary Jane, how long will she hold up because she is and will always be the target but that is his one weakness so I guess it's cool for now.<br /><br /> Good bad villains were used in this especially the popular venom. I can only imagine that should there be a 4rth film that Carnage is next up to fight. The films pacing was pretty good, good suspense and great action, this may have been the most exciting of the three. The cinematography was great, acting was good, and the fight sequences were on point. The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 has to be that the usage of the villains went a little wrong but because these characters are not exactly human there is so much that can be done with them in the future. Where do you think Carnage comes from? There would be no him without Venom. Spider-Man 3 is a great film that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer. Comic fans may get a tad bit irritated but hey you can't expect them to keep everything the same.ction, this may have been the most exciting of the three.

It just gives you yet another way to be yourself the 'best way' possible without giving up your space and emotional well being.

1591841666|5.0|Kenny Rogers in his famous song The Gambler said \\"You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away and know when to run.\\"<br /><br />Seth tells you how to know when do do each.<br /><br />Seth Godin clearly demonstrates why many times quitting is the smartest thing you can do for your business or for your career, but it is only true if you are stuck in a cul de sac, not in a dip. Big results happen in dips. And, creating a dip behind you can make competing with you very difficult and not enticing.<br /><br />In addition to talking about The Dip, Seth demonstrates why superstar thinking is important, why it is sometimes important that you offend people and make yourself stand out. He says that the worst thing you learned in school is to be a well rounded student. Superstars are intensely focused in one specific area. You don't care that your accountant is a good driver or a good golfer, you care that she is masterful at doing your taxes.<br /><br />The book is a very fast read but the lessons are to be studied again and again. And, as you begin realizing where your dip is, Seth outlines the steps you can take to get the results you really desire for your business, for your career, or for your life.<br /><br />A lot of people will think that this is a book all about quitting from the title, but in fact, it is a book about the actions to take when you feel like quitting . . . and knowing when you are stuck in a cul de sac and need to quit to get ahead.<br /><br />Seth is the master of observing what is happening in businesses and culture and giving them names. But he is even more masterful at giving those identified challenges powerful solutions.

0618680004|3.0|As an atheist myself, I wasn't particularly surprised by the majority of this book, but rather, it's seeming weakness. Dawkins continually asserts that for God to be a legitimate explanation of the universe we must explain God and since he is inexplicable he must not exist. Such logic is a misunderstanding of an eternal, noncoporeal God...even as a physicalist, I know that.  <br />His most powerful arguments come from the idea best expressed in his last chapter, namely, that science is a process of consciousness-raising and that we are designed to function in the African savannah and not intergalactic space or on the level of quarks. if he had applied this idea to his argument against God, it would have made a much more interesting book. In fact, the only time I felt excited was when he crammed those shocking little tidbits of scientific relativity in at the end.  <br />In the end, this book functions as a whiny, shallow defense of the power of science when the author clearly had the ability to carpet bomb your sense of reality and all those conventions of thinking on the human scale. exercise of said ability would have had much more potential to lift god-lovers out of darkness. in its absence, i would suggest something like ishmael if you want to engage your brain a bit.

I will let the other reviews do that. <br /> <br /> What I will tell you is that I am 33 years old and have not read a novel since high school. Not because I don't enjoy reading, but because I couldn't find an author worth investing my time into. The search is over. I read this book in 3 days. Then I bought Post Office and Factotum.

B000BGH22W|1.0|John Williams is not simply a hard act to follow...he's THE hard act to follow.  Nonetheless this score falls far short.  There was once magic in the land of Hogwarts.. themes were stated boldly and elevated the story, flurries of woodwinds nurtured scenes of flight.  Doyle's score does dare to quote William's melodies at 3 points in this score.  They are harmonized poorly and treated even worse. The rest of the score just goes downhill from here.  He does introduce his own new \\"themes.\\" These are presented as boring quarter note string lines that you can't seem to remember 10 seconds after you hear them.  The rest of the scoreat it's best is a prime example of dated cliches. The dialogue scenes are overly sappy and the action scenes become hokey in an almost silent film music stlye. Watch the graveyard scene again and laugh,  check out the dance scene where characters get lifted in the air as simple scales comically mirror their moves.   The most common reaction to the music after viewing the film is \\"I don't really remember it as being good or bad.\\" If you go back and watch it again I think you story will change.  The magic is gone.

B000O77SBI|4.0|If you have been following Rush as I have for many years, you know that their legacy as a band is to do the unexpected  - to a point.  Overall, this is probably Rush's darkest compilation to date. I believe this is mostly due to Alex and Geddy's musical choices and the overall production of the record rather than Neil's lyrics; although one song in particular - Good News First - does has a rather pessimistic theme. I'm not sure exactly why, but after listening through the CD a couple times, I was thinking, \\"Rush meets Pink Floyd\\" and then noticed that David Gilmour is mentioned in the credits - the plot thickens.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, Neil has once again written some very thoughtful and poignant words for the times in which we live. The CD also represents a very open and honest agnostic point of view of those times, which some of the religious right might feel threatened by, but needs to be said just the same.  <br /> <br />Musically, the songs themselves are very eclectic with certain parts and phrases that often seemed out of place to me. A lot of flat vocal lines and flat lead solos give the CD a sort of nasty, mean-spirited feel; all in fitting though with the title I suppose. Sonically, this is a very full sounding CD - Alex's guitars, Geddy's bass and vocals and Neil's drums never sounded better; and it is just plain awesome through a pair of nice headphones. Ironically, if some of the songs containing lyrics rub against your musical sensibilities, the CD's hyper-eclectic style works out as a big plus for the three instrumentals that Rush chose to put on the CD. All three have to be - hands down - some of the best instrumentals Rush has ever done. I will eat my hat if Rush doesn't win a Grammy for at least one of them.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0618680004|5.0|The Jewish, Christian and Muslim priestly castes created 'God' in their own pre-Enlightenment image--violent, jealous, intolerant, with a preference for blind obedience over independent thought--for their own political reasons. Dawkins asks why we've shrunk from openly questioning their creation when their message has proved so antisocial, and when science continues to contradict its factual basis. 'The God Delusion' provides crystal clear evidence for closet rationalists to jump the fence and for diehard fundamentalists to fear the end is nigh.  No wonder it's generated such a vitriolic reponse from the happy clappy establishment. The book is the obvious sequel to Dawkins' 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Blind Watchmaker,' and is so exhilarating I found myself air punching and shouting, 'YES!!' while I read it. Buy it, lend it, promote it. The world would be a better place if everyone opened their minds to it.
B000LE1GVW|4.0|I really, really dig the song \\"New Shoes\\".  I generally am very hesitant to buy anything from new artists, because the music business has sucked for so very long (and I was never a fan of the 90's grunge and/or alternative scenes), but I really dig this stuff.  The song New Shoes is wonderful.  Catchy, poppish, and original without any trace of self consciousness.  Will Paolo be the \\"next big thing\\"?  Who really knows?  I just want to hear New Shoes again and again.  It is the best song on the album, but the others are pretty good too.
B00013RC66|4.0|Time has shown this 80s thriller to be a more durable, intriguing film than first it may have seemed. Debra Winger is at her most gorgeous, and the chemistry between her character and Theresa Russell's 'black widow' is palpable. I loved the colourful locations and the sense of glowing health of the cast. People who haven't seen it before will notice the 80s-style male chauvinism, but it doesn't detract from the movie. Great to see the portrayal of several murders without one violent scene or one spurt of blood. A genuinely adult movie.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is probably the most underrated album in the Yes cannon.  It's usually forgotten about.  People like to talk about Topographic, Yessongs, The Yes Album, Close to the Edge, and Fragile, but this album can stand up to any of those records.  In fact, as another reviewer put it, this album was probably the last great burst of prog rock from Yes until Keystudio (and some parts of Drama).  The title track is one of the most searing, rocking tracks Yes has ever recorded.  Parallels is another great rocker.  There are 2 quiet, beautiful songs in Turn of the Century and Wonderous Stories.  Wonderous Stories is arguably the most beautiful track Yes has ever recorded, and it's so moving and uplifting no matter how many times you listen to it.  But the final track, Awaken, is another great epic Yes song, as good (or better) than anything they've ever done.  It's criminally underrated, and deserves mention with the great epic Yes tracks like Close to the Edge, The Gates of Delirium, and Ritual.  It's one of my favorite Yes songs, and the band really brings it home.  If prog was dying in 1978, no one told Yes, because they ended up making one of their greatest albums.

B00005JLCI|5.0|I fell in love with this movie at age 12.  It was one of my first introductions to Shakespeare, apart from my mother's 'Macbeth' bed-time stories.  This movie truly captures all the emotion of the play, and is, in my opinion, the best cinematic interpretation of 'Hamlet' ever made.  I have been waiting for this DVD for too long, and cannot recommend it enough to anyone desiring a fulfilling, emotional movie experience.  I laugh, I am moved to tears, and that is what a good movie should do.  Branagh is superb, as it to be expected, and the score by Patrick Doyle is excellent as well.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|Look, I'm a Pink Floyd fan.  But, all of you who thought the original was much better than the new cut, I've got news for you.  That's because, when you watched the original in 1972, you were tripping.  If the new one looks fake, that's because the original was fake, too.  As more than one reviewer above pointed out, the music is studio-produced and put to footage of Floyd pretending to play.  Guess what-that's true of most other \\"live\\" rock films, too.  Nick's beard comes and goes because footage of Floyd lip-synching in Pompeii is intercut with blue-screen shots of them lip-synching on a sound stage.
B000002J1B|5.0|With over one hundred reviews already, there isn't anything I could add however in my opinion, after the departure of Rick Wakeman during this recording, the addition of keyboardist Patrick Moraz worked out great.  Moraz brought his own trademark sound to this album.  After having to invest a great deal of time to fully digest \\"Tales...\\" \\"Relayer\\" is a step back, albeit small step, from the Topographical music-scape the group nearly lost themselves in their previous release. \\"Tales\\" was and is the anti-climatic peak of the bands adventures in this type of rock opera musicals.  The Gates of Delirium, aptly named, shows the group refocusing their energies and concentrating their final \\"Topographic\\" installment in this final 21 minute tale complete with the sounds of footfalls running, swords clashing, doors slamming... that ends with the pleasing Top 40 release, \\"Soon\\".<br /><br />I didn't like this album at first but after a while and some additional years of maturing, I came to discover that his album actually was the pinnacle of their success.  They could go no farther than they had on \\"Tales\\" so this, as I said, was a step back from that style and a tentative reach toward the bands more accessible rock sounds.  Up to this release, the Yes fans had become conditioned to expecting and receiving an entire vinyl album of perfection. Thinking of Yes as having a bad release was unthinkable at the time. But later came other releases that would cement the fact that Yes was a group of individual musicians that were bound to change and try new areas of music and sounds.  Some with much less success than others.<br /><br />\\"Relayer\\" stands the test of time in that the sounds actually paint musical images when one uses the imagination.  It would take the group nearly ten years to come up with another album where each song was enjoyable and memorable which is what happened when Yes released Atlantic album number 90125.  The period of time between \\"Relayer\\" and \\"90125\\" had only minor memorable songs. Even the much anticipated \\"Big Generator\\" was a huge flop, following so closely on the heels of \\"90125\\" which only goes to show that the group had continued to grow and evolve and the glory days of successive smash hit releases was over. Yes continued to reinvent itself over the years with Wakeman returning and leaving the band much as the tide ebbs and flows.  The once in a lifetime chemistry that produced the first three albums could never be repeated even when the same band members rejoined as each of them had matured and changed. \\"Relayer\\" is still a solid album after all these years. Perhaps it takes a more mature ear to appreciate what the group had back in 1974.only minor memorable songs.

I didn't so much appreciate the essay 'On Fairy Stories' but the book is worth it just for Leaf.

6305907145|2.0|As soon as I read the above editorial, I knew that very little of the DVD could actually be an accurate representation of Austen's title. I mean, it says right there in the official Amazon description, \\"Mansfield Park is an 'autobiographical novel'\\"---it is NOT! Of all the novels, MP is probably the LEAST so; and while Austen was very careful to put realistic life-experiences in her fiction, none of them can be said to be strongly autobiographical, no matter how much fans and critics want them to be. <br /> <br />As someone who completed his Master's thesis on Austen, I know whereof I speak! When Austen novels began to hit the screen back in the '90s, I remember telling a friend--\\"They'll never do Mansfield Park; or they'll transform Fanny completely---which changes the entire main point of the book. MP is supposed to emphasize Fanny's INNER qualities, so Austen had to nearly eliminate the exterior traits of the pretty, perky, outwardly appealing heroine.\\" Those, of course, went to Fanny's devious counter-part, Mary Crawford.  <br /> <br />So, while it's a well-produced film, it's nowhere NEAR Austen's most controversial novel---controversial not because of the issue of slavery, but because most modern readers (along with a few of Austen's contemporaries) don't want a modest, retiring heroine. Which is fine; but then make another movie that doesn't pretend to be based on the book. It's like taking Dickens' Christmas Carol and making Scrooge kind-hearted but misunderstood. Sheesh.

It is a true inspiration to anyone.  It is proof success is the reward for hard work and dedication, that is not based on the color of your skin or the financial status you are born into.

B000KN9G3Y|5.0|I am long term DM fans since 80. This new SACD brough a new level of listening experience. When comparing to the original version, it was just different and a lot of details had been recovered. Dave's vocal was clear. Bass was deep and tight. When you got a chance to listen to it, you might first feel puzzle about the new mixes then you would quite enjoy it til the end of disc. <br />  <br />It is one of my favour DM LP/CD and now it is still. <br />The 5.1 DTS mixes was good but I still prefered the SACD version. Becasue the imaging was better ,the bass was deeper and the most important thing was it sounded warmer. The DVD was in PAL/region 3? format, be sure you have the way to watch it. <br /> <br />If they could have the \\"Get the Balance right\\" and other B-sides on the CD, it would be even better. <br /> <br />If you own a SACD player and you are the DM fans, don't miss the SACD version.

I was astounded at how the book kept my interest alive each time I did so and  would make me feel pressed to go on. Eventually, I decided it was about time, I paid respect to the \\"little book\\" and started off at page one. I have learned a lot from this book and recommend it to one and all, but most especially to people who study or work in an environment where English is the preferred language of communication, but whose native language is not English. This book should be read by all such people, regadless of their level of fluency. Trust me you will be smiling all along, either at having learned a neat little tip, or reminiscizing about the many times you have made the blunders that the book warns about!
B0009EP052|5.0|Because Amazon will not allow customers to change the track listings on CDs, I here provide you with the actual listing for this version of Power, Corruption and Lies: <br />1. Age of Consent <br />2. We All Stand <br />3. The Village <br />4. 586 <br />5. Your Silent Face <br />6. Ultraviolence <br />7. Ecstacy <br />8. Leave Me Alone <br /> <br />This is the original lineup on the album, which has since been overshadowed by the addition of the single \\"Blue Monday\\" for the stateside release. I have only heard the import, but the testimony of some New Order fans is enough to confirm my suspicion that it is superior to the American version. Then again, I only purchased this one because I was lucky enough to find a used copy at a lower price, and even then, it was not without a considerable inner debate.
B00000IQC8|2.0|Yes, this is deemed a cult classic however, it is full of poorly delivered dialogue and cheesy one-liners.  I would imagine it would be far more entertaining under the influence.  Silent Bob is the best actor in the whole thing ... imagine that.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|The review by displacedhuman accurately describes the plot.  No description, however, can adequately convey how hilarious this movie is.  All of the action takes place in the swank apartment of the protagantist, who is ultimately reduced to admiting that the idiot he has invited to dinner has human qualities that cannot be vouchsafed.  On the way to this realization, though, our poor hero is betrayed again and again by the stupidity of his idiot.  The pinnacle comes when the idiot's workmate (who else?) discovers who's wife is sleeping with whom.  Worth twice the price Amazon is charging.

0345350499|1.0|Where do all these 5 stars come from?  By page 30 it was obvious that the book is incredibly biased against (1) men and (2) Christianity.  The accusations leveled at Christianity are ludicrous, taking the most repellent and worn-out traditions (which were not part of the early church) and making them seem central to Christianity.  And as others have pointed out, the paganism portrayed in this book is not close to historically accurate;  it's an utterly revisionist, fantastic version.  The first protagonist, Igraine, was likeable for a while but by the end of a couple of chapters it was clear she took great joy in totally demeaning and mentally emasculating her husband.  About that point I put the book down;  I have precious little time for reading as it is (and not because I watch any TV).  I guess someone who hates men could enjoy this, but I did not.  Besides, just as I thought I was getting to know Igraine, she makes this complete personality change!  She became someone I did not know anymore.  And none of the other characters had any depth.  Maybe some day I'll try to slog through some more of it, but I doubt it will change my rating.
B00000JPH6|5.0|they really did a great job of remastering this muppet masterpiece. completely satisfied and thrilled i can watch this whenever i want.

0618680004|5.0|This book is insightful and informative.  It highlights the basic flaws in reigion and religious based belief systems.  Among its many well stated arguments, the book explains the true meaning behind the scientific theory of evolution and how it works as an ongoing investigation into the natural world based on fossil evidence and observation.  The author writes in a style which is both witty and entertaining.  He provides a devasting attack on blind religious belief as the cause of much suffering and strife in human history and the world today.  This book provides the best argument for atheism to date.  I would highly recommend this book to all who have even a passing interest in religion.
B000002LK1|5.0|I first bought this album 15yrs ago.  This album has great songs that take you back to those fustrading teenage years.  I bought this album again, and It is still inspiring.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|The first time I saw the film I was left confused. It took 3 viewings to really understand and then I cried. I really think fewer actors would have made the confusion less. I do believe this is a very very good film but again unless you are exceptional at following a script you will have to allow another viewing or two. I did really love it though and it will always leave me guessing about the subject and WHAT IS REALLY THE TRUTH behind the curtains. Finally this film reconfirmed my doubts of our government's honesty and their ideas and actions.
0380730405|5.0|This book was published in 1938 -- and is still one of the best of the mystery genre.  DuMaurier is a master of characterization as well as an expert purveyor of suspense. It's interesting how the times have influenced today's writers.  Rebecca has no profanity and no explicit sex scenes.  I didn't miss them!
B000NA1OXY|1.0|Did Avril get a lobotomy??I loved her first two albums but this one just stinks, plain and simple.It's painful to listen to these songs. The lyrics are beyond immature,I felt like I was listening to some 12 year old's diary. <br />It's just incredibly bad. I'm so disapointed. I guess all these people that called Avril Lavigne a \\"poser\\" were right all along. If she has any talent, it sure isn't showing in this album. <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool was a my favorite band through all four years of highschool. I hated highschool, and songs like \\"The Patient\\" became personal mantras for me. Towards the end of highschool, however, me love for Tool began to wane as the things which once drew me to the band began to push me away. 10,000 Days was the \\"icing\\" on the cake for me- combined with the then recent A Perfect Circle endeavours and Maynard being himself, I saw it as Tool turning away from their intellectualism and spirituality for something less than worthy.<br /><br />However, after a year my opinion has changed. \\"Lateralus\\" was a spaced out adventure, and \\"Aenima\\" was great too, but that album had a bit too much filler in it. The only problem with both those albums is that, though I think they were musically better, they failed to capture the energy of albums like \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Opiate\\". \\"10,000 Days\\" brings Tool 'round full circle by combining the musical styles of \\"Lateralus\\" with the energy of \\"Undertow\\".<br /><br />I've taken points off because this album, like all recent Tool albums, suffers from excessive filler. In fact, there's only 5 or 6 \\"real\\" songs on the album. But, lyrically, this album is so much more down to earth than \\"Lateralus'\\" far out spirituality or the drug induced \\"Aenima's\\". There's plenty of anger but it's not all rage like \\"Undertow\\" or \\"Opiate\\". Also, I might be alone on sensing this but I swear there's plenty of \\"christian\\" undertones in the lyrics, but feel free to discuss.<br /><br />Musically, it still sounds like Tool. But for the first time in awhile, Tool have a produced an album that gets the blood pumping. Adam plays the Guitar like it's a Guitar most times and Justin plays the bass like it's a Bass most of the time. By all means, this is an album you listen to loud in the car, sober, or during the day and it's probably better listened that way. Production values are looser than the super polished \\"lateralus\\", but perhaps that's a good thing?<br /><br />The art is also phenomenal. Very strange. But it's something that has to be experienced.<br /><br />So, in all, this album is a big \\"Welcome Back!\\" for Tool. To be precise, it's a \\"Welcome Back, You're a Rock band again.\\"he art is also phenomenal. Very strange. But it's something that has to be experienced. <br /> <br />So, in all, this album is a big \\"Welcome Back!\\" for Tool. To be precise, it's a \\"Welcome Back, You're a Rock band again.\\" <br />
B00003CXTG|2.0|\\"Pearl Harbour\\" could have been one of the great movies that stick with you for ages after the final credits were run. Although there were some excellent points, the overall movie failed to live up to that potential.<br /><br />The plot follows to aeroplane-obsessed friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker. Rafe falls in love with a girl Evelyn Johnson, but soon joins the Air Force, where he goes missing. Walker and Johnson end up in Pearl Harbour, start falling in love and then things get more complicated by not only the Japanese military, but also Rafe.<br /><br />The story rather descends into the mediocre with its amateurish mingling of romance with war. Rather than do one or the other well, it does both appallingly. Unlike other movies that mix genres well, (such as the horror/romantic comedy in [[ASIN:B000B2YR8I Shaun of the Dead]]), \\"Pearl Harbour\\" fails to inspire.<br /><br />The action scenes were fairly well executed, the CGI being of an excellent quality that enhanced the movie. Cuba Gooding Jnr was also another highlight in his role as Petty Officer Doris Miller. He really was a rare high point in this movie.<br /><br />For war movie lovers, avoid this one. For romance movie buffs, avoid this one. It was a tragic movie, and not in the good sense.
B00005JPFF|1.0|I waited a long time for this movie to come out. I watched the trailers with anticipation and slowly awaited its release into theaters. I heard great stuff about this film. \\"The best spider man\\" or \\"best movie of the year\\". So yeah, I had some pretty high hopes for this movie. Would Harry try to get back at Parker? Would Parker marry Mary Jane? Would Jamison finally get off spider man's back?<br /><br />Then I saw the movie. Well actually, I almost didn't, because I almost fell asleep half way through. The whole movie was boring from the opening to the cry baby ending. Nothing here was fun; even the bad guys were stupid. How can you have venom in your movie and have it suck? That takes skill, or lack of skill.<br /><br />this movie suffers from Pirates of the Caribbean 2 syndrome, which is basically \\"bigger is better, so lets jam as much stuff into a movie as we possibly can.\\" yeah, pirates was a complete flop because they tried to jam too much into the movie, and this one is the same. There are too many sub plots and no main plot. i mean come on, first we have sandman trying to get money to save his daughter (subplot 1) then spider man basking in his new fame and glory (subplot 2) then Harry trying to kill spidy and then being put in a coma and losing his memory, so now he doesn't even remember his fathers death (subplot 3). then Mary Jain losses her job and starts hating parker for being insensitive (subplot 4) and then spidy gets attacked by dark matter turning him into a bad guy (subplot 5) then parkers job is threatened by a new photographer (subplot 6) then Harry wakes up from his comma and starts going after peters heart, sound familiar? (Subplot 7). Not to mention the revelation that sandman was uncle bens real killer (subplot 8). Good god, that a lot of stuff. there's enough here to make two or three movies, but instead of doing that they decide to jam it all into one three hour movie (that's way too long by the way. the LOTR could pull that off, but not SM). What is missing though in this movie is a central plot. Unlike the first two movies there is no central plot that the rest revolve around. In the first it was Parker tying to learn how to use his powers properly and fight off Green Goblin, in the second it was Parker trying to juggle being a college student, spider man, his love life, his job, and his friends all at the same time and failing badly. Here it's just a jumble of subplots thrown in together with no logical thinking behind it. What is the main plot? Please, fans of the movie tell me. Was it spidy turning bad? Was it Sandman killing his uncle? What was it? Everything in this movie is just sort of randomly thrown together. After the first hour I got bored and almost fell asleep but couldn't because the lady sitting to me was eating her popcorn too loudly. too bad, I could have caught up on my sleep, but no, I had to watch this movie till the bitter end.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the ending. First of all didn't the scene where Mary Jane is stuck in the wed and the cad is slowly making its way down to her look kind of similar to a scene in Jurassic Park? Yeah, I think it did. Second, when did spidy become so much of a wimp? I mean really, I know he was outnumbered, but he is a veteran super hero, while sandy and venom were newbie's. Couldn't he have at least put up a halfway decent fight?  I don't want to ruin the ending for you but pretty much think of the most clich&eacute;, corny, idiotic thing that could possibly happen and that is the ending. I'll give you a clue, it involves Harry.<br />And after the battle when everyone was crying and boohooing I was just rolling my eyes. Everyone cries at the end, even sandman. How can he cry? He's made of sand. Now don't get me wrong, I like sad movies (read some of my lists and you can see that for yourself) but the \\"sad\\" ending in this movie was so over the top, so corny, so clich&eacute;, that I almost threw my popcorn at the screen in frustration.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed the heck out of me was that the characters would constantly say and do the absolute worst things they could possible can at the absolute worst times. Mary Jane is going through a rough time, so Parker kisses another girl in public and then doesn't understand why she's upset. Please...<br /><br />Overall this movie sucked. Nothing good here, not even the fight scenes. You should still go see it just because, but don't expect anything like the first two movies. This one was bad, plain and simple. if you read thsi review, whether you agree with me or not, please leave a comment.the heck out of me was that the characters would constantly say and do the absolute worst things they could possible can at the absolute worst times.

B000065U1N|4.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is not a complex movie, but it is gritty and real. Holding nothing back in the violence stakes, it plunges the viewer right into the middle of a ground battle in an urban setting.<br /><br />Following a unit of Rangers in an extraction mission in Somalia's Mogadishu. The mission goes disastrously wrong when the local militia decide to hit back. The militia shoot down a helicopter and the mission goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The action scenes, of which the movie is full, are gritty, realistic and close up. The violence is reasonably graphic, but not overly so. I think [[ASIN:B000068TPN We Were Soldiers (Widescreen Edition)]] is more graphic in this sense. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" makes the action frenetic and dirty, and that makes it one exciting movie to watch.<br /><br />The movie does something to introduce the complexities of operating in Somalia, and the obstacles that faced the US forces there. The fact that Hoot could wander about the arms markets in Mogadishu goes some way to increase the confusing relations between the locals and the US forces.<br /><br />For a movie heavy on action, lots of battles and tension, but relatively light on the intellectual loading, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a great one. I loved it and have seen it a number of times.
B000OY8NII|5.0|Eureka is a wonderful show. It is thoughtful, entertaining and on occasion very moving. It is one of the best shows available at this time. While it is not prudish it doesn't rely on the extremes of sex and violence so common on the popular network shows today. Instead, well constructed imaginative sci-fi plots, and a lot of humor make this show great for all ages. I highly recommend it.
B00005ATQF|4.0|\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a very effective movie about the training and war in Vietnam. Following the character Private Joker, the movie takes in the training of new recruits and their experiences in Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie itself really is an illustration of the dehumanising effects of war and the training. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann particularly illustrates this in his treatment of Private Pyle, (and, yes, Hartman has a lot of fun with Pyle's name). The dehumanising theme is continued in the Vietnam part of the movie, with the soldier's views on the locals being very much as objects. The movie does not simplify it, but looks at the complexities of the moral choices that face the soldiers in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a powerful look into the realities of war's effects on people. It is a hard movie to really \\"enjoy\\", but it is a very good film all the same. I have seen it a few times, and it has stuck in my memory for the way it addresses a very complicated and broad topic.
B000007489|5.0|This is still my favorite Suicidal CD. If you're only going to get one Suicidal Tendencies CD, get this one.
1582701709|5.0|I found this book to be totally engaging.  It was written in a format that was easy to read, yet it held complelling information.  I have always believed in the power of our mind so I accept the message it had.  I was able to put it down and pick it up during moments of free time and easily get back into reading.  I actually read it two times, and feel that I will continue to reflect back on it and re-read sections.  It certainly changed my perspective on many things.  I go to work with a more positive attitude and focus on good things.  That is itself has been reward enough for purchasing the book.  I remember to be grateful for even small things and to look to the future with excitment and belief that life will be good.  I think everyone should give the book a try.  I have recommended it to many friends, and have even purchased a few copies as gifts.
0751532711|5.0|Kiyosaki's ideas in this book are staggering. I have always paid 20% of any restaurant bill for waiting services. I still do so today. However, after reading this book, I now wonder why I hesitate paying any 'good' broker 5% for a good investment deal. Kiyosaki's ideas are simple and straightforward. Acquire assets, assets, and more assets. Rather than depend on your monthly income to meet your necessary and luxurious expenses, look for good investment opportunites and exploit the returns. There are still people in this world who consider education the sole means for success in their careers. Many students I know experience this kind of pressure from their parents. Kiyosaki's book gives hope and assurance to students with various types of problems including: financial and intellectual (learning diabilities). Instead of focusing on memorizing theories and concepts in school, Kiyosaki advises the reader to turn to financial literacy instead. I recommend this book to those who aspire to be successful in their careers, even when attaining an academic degree seems impossible for a number of reasons including: financial, intellectual, or even social.
B000BCE918|4.0|It's a great value if you like two of the movies.  But it's the same as buying one of those \\"Wal-Mart specials,\\" where you get a good movie with one or two movies that are so-so stuck in with it.

B000001ESP|5.0|OK folks, I don't want to sound over the top here but only one album can be the \\"best ever\\" and this is it for me.  Every track is outstanding.    This came out in my freshman year of HS but since I had no older siblings it generally passed me by until Signals came out.  I picked it up, went to the New World Man tour where they played every song from 'Moving Pictures' except for 'Witch Hunt' and hence... I found my favorite band.  As soon as I had the money I went to the store and bought up every Rush album including 'Moving Pictures'.    At that time a new technology was being developed -- the Compact Disc.  'Moving Pictures' was one of a handful of albums chosen for this new experimental technology and they could not have chosen a better set of songs for this experiment.  If I remember correctly the CD cost about $20 which was about 3 times the cost of vinyl.  It was well worth the cost.    Everybody knows about Tom Sawyer and Limelight -- played on classic rock stations to this day.  They have played these two songs on every concert as well and after 25 years I have almost had enough.  Notice I say 'almost'.      Unfortunately, along with YYZ, side B gets overlooked.  I listen to side B more often than side A because they are never played on the radio and the quality is just as good.  I remember being completely fascinated at how an 11 minute song (Camera eye) can have such little singing and come out so fantastic.  The traveling Lifeson arpeggios are simple yet clever and sound so outstanding with the other instruments as you travel from NY to London in a variety of time signatures that change like a well oiled Mercedes.    Witch hunt makes you feel like you are in a Salem witch trial with the mob stirring in the background.  The synth in this song is some of their best use of keyboards ever.       Vital Signs sounds a little different than the rest of the album but it is a perfect ending to a perfect record.  \\"Unstable condition.  A symptom of Life.\\"  The end of the song is so strong it makes you want to hit the repeat button and start it all over again with Tom Sawyer.
1400063515|3.0|I'm a mathematician and former trader, and I've always enjoyed Taleb's work, from his technical tome on derivatives, \\"Dynamic Hedging,\\" to the brilliant \\"Fooled by Randomness.\\"  These books provided a healthy dose of empirical skepticism about a field that sometimes gets carried away with its own \\"precise\\" models -- as well as some insightful commentary on why people are bad at recognizing randomness and making predictions, and how we should be wary of charlatans (and fools) trying to sell us false certainty, especially about financial markets.  Unfortunately, \\"The Black Swan\\" doesn't say much that \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" didn't already say (and say better), and I was disappointed by most of the new material. <br /> <br />First, Taleb's ideas on uncertainty have gone a bit over the edge.  Before, he denounced the poor use of over-simplified models (i.e. the bell curve) to model uncertainty; he now seems to have given up on models altogether (save for a brief and justified nod to Benoit Mandelbrot).  Rather than just attack bad science, and encourage better science in its place, he seems to view the entire scientific enterprise as hopeless -- adopting the somewhat anti-intellectual attitude that we should stop trying to \\"understand\\" markets at all, and be more like Fat Tony, the trader from Brooklyn.  His portrayal of mathematical finance types is a complete caricature, which is amusing because, whether he likes it or not, he's one of them!  (Taleb has taught in the mathematical finance program at NYU's prestigious Courant Institute.)  The idea that mainstream academics are too myopic to see beyond their bell-curve models is laughable, and in many cases, decades out of date -- even undergrads learn about the flaws in the Black-Scholes model, and the problem of \\"fat tails.\\" <br /> <br />While \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" suggests (wisely) that we pay attention to the magnitude of events and not just their probabilities, in \\"The Black Swan\\" he throws out probability altogether.  This results in some bizarre advice, such as that people should structure their lives (and financial portfolios) to capture \\"positive black swans,\\" i.e. huge but unlikely turns of good fortune, because \\"unlikely\\" is a meaningless probabilistic notion.  For example, he suggests that people should put 90% of their assets in extremely safe instruments (like T-bills), while gambling the remaining 10% on risky ventures and hoping to hit it big.  He claims that this limits one's downside while waiting for a big windfall ... but what happens when the \\"risky\\" 10% gets wiped out in a year or two?  Do you then start investing your remaining assets (possibly losing more), or do you just stick with low-yield T-bills for the rest of your life?  Taleb seemingly hasn't thought it out that far.  By the \\"positive black swan\\" logic, thousands of unemployed \\"actors,\\" waiting for that big break that never comes, have the right idea -- not to mention people who waste their money on lottery tickets (hey, the downside is only a buck, but the upside is millions!).  This seems to be a complete reversal from \\"Fooled by Randomness,\\" which had a brighter view of skilled (\\"Mediocristan\\") pursuits like dentistry, where one avoids living at the behest of good or bad fortune altogether. <br /> <br />Finally, Taleb has always exuded snobbery in his writing -- in the past it has almost been charming -- but this time it quickly wears out its welcome.  He never fails to remind the reader that he sees himself as an erudite \\"gentleman trader,\\" a rogue philosopher among philistines and eggheads.  Yawn. <br /> <br />I still give this book 3 stars, because it does have some decent content, but read \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" instead.  If you've already read that book, there's no need to buy this one -- but if you're in the mood to read about the problems of uncertainty and prediction in the markets, check out \\"When Genius Failed\\" by Lowenstein, \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" by Malkiel, or (for the eggheads) \\"Fractals and Scaling in Finance\\" by Mandelbrot.
6305907145|4.0|I always anticipate the difficulty of a relatively short film (2 hours or under) being able to fully bring to life the characters of ANY complex and beloved novel. Aside from maybe the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice, very few movies who aspire to bring Jane Austen's novels to life ever do. That being said. This movie is a piece of art in its own right, and also should be seen as such. I enjoyed this film. And while it did take many liberties, I still feel it was a genuinely well done movie. I LOVE Jane Austen's novels, for she was a woman entrenched in her time but also ahead of her time. I don't think she would take her stories to be sacrosanct, as many of her admirers and critics do. I enjoyed this cast and what the director did with the story. I was endeared to this Mansfield Park and the world that was created in it.
B00004VWA7|5.0|I wasn't sure at first, but after listening a dozen times, there's more subtle detail than I realized at first, both from Jaco himself and the collection of phenomenal musicians he got to collaborate with him.  The bonus tracks are really great too - not just some \\"junk\\" they added to make it look good. <br /> <br />It's rare to find a CD with this much musical sense, and you can \\"hear\\" the musicians listening to one another and framing each other. <br /> <br />One of the best CDs I own.
B000EGCITG|4.0|The album is pretty good. Just that after a few listens it gets slightly repititious. Just like Pink's other albums. But I bought it on the strength of 2 songs \\"Mr President\\" and \\"Just You and Your Hand Tonight\\" and they didn't dissapoint.
0920668372|5.0|This was one of my favorite stories when I was a kid, and now I'm passing it on to my daughter.  It reassures kids that no matter what, mommy will always love you:)

I dont get tired of it and I really like playing it in my car for my friends who say \\"Who is this?\\" The tunes are really catchy. My favorites are \\"Big Girls\\", \\"Grace Kelly\\", \\"Billy Brown\\" and \\"Love Today\\" but really they are all good.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|A truly lovely film. Unusual story, brought to life with great attention to detail. Very romantic,touching.
B000O178BY|4.0|This album is a wonderful concept album that ties in with its accompanying ARG (alternative reality game).  However, the album has the ability to stand on its own as well.<br /><br />The album brings together a set of topics that many people prefer to stay away from (politics, etc.).  I would recommend staying away if you do not like artists expressing their views on the issues (but if you are listening to NIN, I would wager that you probably don't mind).<br /><br />Taking a simplistic approach, Trent Reznor has resurrected his instrumental pieces and mixed them with what brings a feeling of the earlier days using electronics in music (reminiscent, I feel, of the original recordings in Purest Feeling without the spoken word sampling).<br /><br />There is a feeling that the album was written working from beat upwards to melody.  This makes the album have a solid, driving foundation and keeps each piece extremely unique from the ground up.<br /><br />What makes this unique amongst NIN albums is the smoothness of the orchestration.  From beat to melody, the album lacks anything \\"scathing\\" distortion and has instead opted for a polished, submissive and trance-like feel.<br /><br />Recommended for current NIN fans, I would not recommend this as \\"the place to start\\" if you are interested in the collection of Trent Reznor's works.

0143037757|2.0|Although there are quite a few books on aspects of European History written from a specific ideological angle, not many of them give an overview of the entire period. This book is one of them and, inevitably, it will cause many debates between those who agree and those who disagree with the author's political views. However, such a book should not be judged according to its political orientation but according to the  consistency and coherence of its documentation and argumentation. It is in this respect I have some objections to the book.<br /><br />In my opinion, its most fundamental flaw is the identification of liberal ideologies in Europe (centrist, social-democratic, Labour etc.) with left-wing radicalism, including accusations of Communist appeasement. If any proof were required for the manifest fallacy of this generalization, it is provided by facts described in the book itself, much as these are downplayed. The demand for fairer social policies and respect for human and civil rights by the liberals was not motivated by Communist sympathies but by the experience of the Nazi and the other fascist regimes (including the USSR) whose horrors are described well in the book. Liberal criticism focused only on actions and policies that contradicted the values for which the West was fighting the Communist tyranny. The book does not deny that such policies existed but excuses them in the usual the-goal-justifies-the-means manner. What is worse, it accuses those criticizing these policies as being soft on Communism! Absurdly, the book brands liberals as \\"discontents of prosperity\\", even though they were those who called for opportunities for more people to partake in exactly this prosperity.<br /><br />One is tempted to believe that in reality, Judt's problem is not the inhumanity and lack of freedom in Communism, since he is often indifferent to other cases of suppression of freedom by non-communist dictators. Rather, it looks as if he objects to the principle of more social justice and greater opportunities for the more disadvantaged members of the society to realize their potential, a principle he wrongly associates with its perversion in the communist regims. While, many people were indeed misled by the Communist rhetoric into an outlook sympathetic towards the Eastern Block dictatorships, the overwhelming majority of those believing in this principle had definitely nothing to do with Communism and a large segment of them actively fought Communism (the Christian Social Union in Bavaria comes to mind).<br /><br />It is a distortion of historical truth verging on the defamatory to collectively associate all those inspired by values of humanity with the Communist monstrosities.of more social justice and greater opportunities for the more disadvantaged members of the society to realize their potential, a principle he wrongly associates with its perversion in the communist regims.

In listening to it all day, I've been flooded with nostalgia. If only I could've written songs back then! But this isn't to say this is a CD that's only for a young audience. It's really well done and easy to listen to. What a great voice -- reminiscent of Deanna Carter and even the sweet, sweet sound of Alison Krauss on the ballads.
B000N6TX22|5.0|The movie was amazing. The filming was documentary style and the fimmakers really pull you into the action. It makes you feel as if you're watching news footage of the future. Really cool! Loved the movie! BUT the HDDVD is a bloody pain; it doesn't work properly in my HDDVD player. I was so mad, but I had been dying to watch the film, so I flopped it over and watched the regular DVD side. The actual filming is very moody, and gets you depressed and moved. The DVD quality is not so nice; the compression is botchy. The fault is on the DVD technitions not the filmmakers, and it's too bad because the movie is very suave! If you like sci fi this will rock your socks! ONE STAR FOR DUAL DISC! ONE STAR FOR DUAL DISC! THEY DON'T WORK :(

B000OMD4BG|4.0|If EITHER/OR, ELLIOTT SMITH & XO are his best albums, I'd say NEW MOON is 4th in line. Longtime fans, need no persuading, but this probably isn't the best place to start. This is after all, an over-generous collection of outtakes. True, they lack the Brian Wilson-like arrangements of his last 3 albums. But the lo-fi quality here is far from sub-par. Without a doubt, the folks at KRS put this together with love & care.<br /><br />For my money, Smith was undoubtedly, one of the finest songwriters to emerge from the mid 90's. In terms of angst & heartache, he all too quietly pulled the rug out from under Kurt Cobain. Suffice it to say, all the songs here are terrific. Vintage Elliott Smith. Catchy Beatleseque hooks, intimate vocals. Audio butterscotch. Smith's unique playing style is on full display, especially on \\"Seen How Things Are Hard\\".<br /><br />Recorded between 1994-97, Smith was probably wise to leave these songs off his official releases. Not because the the songs were bad. But one gets the sense that his best albums would have been less so with their inclusion. Fortunately for fans, they all work so well together here. Sequencing is half the battle on things like this & folks here have done a fine job. Nothing feels particularly thrown together last minute.<br /><br />Highlights include, the fragile, \\"Angel In The Snow\\" and the bleak, \\"All Cleaned Out\\". The early version of \\"Pretty Mary K\\" outshines its eventual incarnation on FIGURE 8. And it's nice to finally hear the title track of \\"Either/Or\\". Oddly enough, the last 2 tracks (\\"See You Later\\" and \\"Half Right\\") act as more of a fitting fond farewell than nearly all of FROM A BASEMENT ON THE HILL.<br /><br />Like much of Smith's classic work, alot of the songs herein evoke a similar mood to that found on Nick Drake's PINK MOON. Comparison between Smith and Drake has never been much of a stretch though The Beatles have been cited as a major influence.<br /><br />While somewhat underrated, BASEMENT felt a little stitched together and ghoulish but MOON organically captures Smith at the height of his powers. Though, there's nothing here that particlualy sheds any new light, Smith always excelled at leaving you wanting more. Well, here you go.<br /><br />An essential glance back at what we all miss.ut MOON organically captures Smith at the height of his powers.

B00005JGAB|5.0|Great CD. I wish I grew up when the Ramones were getting big, but I was about a generation too late. Today's music is total crap with a few exceptions. There are too many labels and genres. Feels like people are trying to pretend they've got everything figured out by now. Or maybe that's how it's always been in music. Lot's of crap with a few beautiful exceptions.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|I have been to several Rings -- 2 in San Francisco, 4 in Seattle and even the 1990 Met production on this DVD. I have also seen several versions of the Ring on DVD, including Stuttgard and Bayreuth productions. Of all the Rings I have seen this Met production is the only one that meets Wagner's standard as he wrote it -- with the visuals true to his directions. It is this version of the Ring that I show to my local opera group, and the only one I recommend as an introduction to the greatness and immensity of the Ring itself. The other versions, though excellent productions in themselves, are not produced the way Wagner wrote it, as Nordic mythology, but as a contemporary interpretation of this amazing work.<br /><br />This production is as good as any opera you would expect from the Met. Because the Met has all the latest equipment and technology available to them to really put on an incredible show you should expect nothing less but breathtaking -- and all the special effects are there (no horses, however). The most disappointing character, however, was the dragon. It was pitiful! (We call it a crab or Dungeness dragon at our house!) Shame on the Met for not having more imagination and giving us a truly awesome dragon. They certainly have the talent to pull it off much better than they did. Seattle's dragon was the best I have ever seen -- and they were able to keep it a secret from the audience up until its amazing debut. Kudos to them! The Fire Music at the end of Die Walkure is breathtaking, and you are left with the feeling you have truly seen the best there is. Siegfried was a lot of fun to watch. Mime was fabulous and with all his antics it was hard to remember that he is a good tenor in his own right. The only frustrating thing was in the third act, Siegfried's ring kept mysteriously switching from one hand to the other and it became distracting. I actually counted eight times the ring switched hands -- my suspicion was that it was two takes that were spliced together. But why Siegfried can't remember which hand he had originally put the ring is beyond me.<br /><br />I was at the 1990 Met production and got to see the Immolation Scene at the end of Gotterdammerung from the back of the orchestra section. It was truly stupendous! I kept poking my mother saying, \\"They really pulled it off! Wow!\\" The DVD version was less spectacular, however, with the camera intent on getting close-ups instead of just backing up to a full stage and letting the special effects run their course. You lost the continuity of the staging, suddenly finding yourself underwater with the Rhinemaidens, and not knowing how you got there. It's a shame that they didn't duplicate the experience I saw being in the audience. It's hard to describe to anyone watching the DVD.<br /><br />The singing, though not really spectacular except for the brilliance of James Morris, Matti Salminen and perhaps Jessye Norman, was more than adequate. Although the singing took a back seat to the \\"Dream Team\\" of Kirsten Flagstad, Lauritz Melchior and Frederich Schorr, the singers were always on key and certainly gave it their best professional performance. Hildegarde Behrens will never be another Birgit Nilsson, but she certainly made up for it in her exquisite acting ability, her loveliness and her physical agility. She was a believable Brunnhilde, and that's hard to find in today's buxom bunch. The close-ups of her facial expressions and body language were truly hypnotic. Siegfried Jerusalem was also very believable as his name-sake, superbly pulling off his role, though you could see how increasingly tired he was getting by the end of Gotterdammerung. He acted the true teenage brat and jumped over logs in the forest with ease. Matti Salminen was a sinister Hagen. Not only was his deep voice magnificent, but his acting was also wonderful. In the dream sequence with Alberich he did not blink once, but just stared straight ahead. It was riveting.<br /><br />James Levine is still the master of conducting The Ring. His orchestra was in top form and was rich and exciting. In the Solti recording, however, they used real alpen horns in Gotterdammerung, making the vassal scene a bit more realistic.<br /><br />In general, other than some minor criticisms, this is a superb \\"traditional\\" production and should be shown before you see any other contemporary interpretation. As they said in Seattle, \\"Sometimes you just want to see 'it' and not an interpretation of 'it.'\\" This is really a wonderful production and Wagner himself would have been proud. My opera group loved it and couldn't stop talking about it, and I guess that's the real proof.e Ring. His orchestra was in top form and was rich and exciting.

B000065PUE|5.0|But at the same time I'm kind of glad that so few people know about the Pixies. No, forget that. I know I listened to crap before I found out what good music was. Sometimes I need to warm up to a band a little, but with the Pixies it was love from the beginning. This is my favorite Pixies album, I think. But Wave of mutilation is a good CD if you want to listen to your favorite Pixies songs. I don't care what people say about best of albums. They are convenient. Seriously though, awesome CD. You can call them Post-Punk, but I'm always gonna think Punk Rock when I think the Pixies. I never really understood that label. Didn't know Punk was a period of time. Also, I don't you you should review things you don't like.
B00007J4SI|3.0|I've listened to this recording for 6 months now, and I have a few thoughts to share.  First, it might help to consider this recording is NOT the complete piano music of Scriabin.  Actually, it is not even close to the complete recording.  What is missing takes up another 2 CDs.  Second, the playing is adequate.  I'll explain.  Scriabin's work is full of colorful dynamics; it is also poignant, covering a broad range of emotion.  Each and every composition demands from the pianist in a way that can overwhelm a musician, and, in this case, I think it did.  For me, the emotional messages of pain, fear, desire, and so on were missing, and these emotional messages are at the heart of Scriabin's work. Finally, I prefer a piano sound that is not so bright.  At times, when the composition reached its climax, I cringed a bit at what I experienced as a unpleasant piercing sound.  In the end, I still encourage you to explore this recording for yourself if you are so inclined.  I think listening to many recordings by different artists helps us all refine our taste in music.  A recording, in my opinion, is never a complete waste of money.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I have to admit I passed this movie by so many times thinking it would not be good, but when I finally broke down to watch it ... oh boy ... did I enjoy it -- It's a well-put-together feel-good story and you'll feel good watching it.  I found that I was more partial to the Kate Winslet side of the movie as I found her story much more intriguing and heart-wrenching.  The story involving Cameron Diaz was good too, but I think you're heart will break more for Kate.  This movie is well worth watching -- I know you'll enjoy it ... I did ... !
B000NIVJHM|3.0|After all the DVDs that have been released of Dirty Dancing, the movie is still in Wide Screen format, so I gave this DVD 3 stars, because the production company should've released the 20th Anniversary in full screen format.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|As a twenty-eight year major fan of the band, I find S&A to be their most complete and enjoyable album since Moving Pictures.   I have already listened to this one start to finish more times than 2002's poorly produced Vapor Trails (shame in that it had great songs - hope the 'unclipped' version is on the horizon).  There is not a weak song on S&A, and many new classics in my opinion (Far Cry, Spindrift, TWTWB, Faithless, Bravest Face, three instrumentals).   Nothing will ever unseat Moving Pictures and Permanent Waves from the top of my Rush favorites list, but I now have a new number three - Snakes & Arrows (sorry Hemispheres for the demotion!).

B000N6TX1I|2.0|I'm American, but my parents were from the British Isles so I didn't struggle with the Brit accents, though I'm guessing many non-Brits may have. I did struggle with the sound in that I couldn't hear dialogue one moment, would turn up the volume accordingly, and then get blasted by a surprise loud sound. I grow quickly resentful of movies that make me focus more on the volume control than the movie itself.<br /><br />If it was given in the movie, I missed out on the goal of our anti-hero  and the young woman and the miracle baby -I somehow didn't hear exactly what 'The Human Project' was, that is, I knew they were desperate unto death to make it there but without knowing why or what it was.<br /><br />I agree with those who lauded the technical achievements of the film -cinematography, set design, casting, costuming, etc., but I also agree with those who noted all the loose ends, lack of back story, and nonsensical notion that (1) the loss of procreation ability has prompted an epidemic of illegal immigration, and (2) that the Brit government appears to be focused on nothing but their capture and eradication. Why?!?<br /><br />The movie uses the age-old premise of 'big peril/little peril' (a sterile and therefore doomed human race in the big picture, and a totalitarian militaristic response by the British government that threatens our heroes at every turn in the more immediate picture)but offers not a hint as to *why* it should happen that way in these circumstances, not a hint as to why everything and everyone in the world has broken down -except for the British government's military capacity. WHY?<br /><br />Ultimately, I found myself checking the length of the movie from the Netflix sleeve and calculating when it would be over -never a good sign.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|I was totally let down. Since I had read the book, I could not wait to see the movie.  Bad Move!  The book was very thought provoking, but the screen version did not follow the story line at all.  I had to force myself to finish watching it.  Don't waste your time or money
0887306667|4.0|This book was fun to read. It is straight to the point, a quick read, easy to follow and written for the novice or expert with lots of meaningful contents, great ideas and examples. It is not a book that will leave you confused, it will leave you with a full understanding of what it takes to be successful in marketing. This book is not going to turn you into a marketing guru over night.  \\"Marketing situations are subject to a zillion of circumstances\\"  as Alexander Repiev puts it.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|With an HD tv (1080i or better), good dvd player and HDMI connection, this is one of the finest nature documentaries ever made. I'm not a nature documentary fan, I mean I remember the National Geographic days, but I didn't go out to try to find them on tv. You get access to some of the most amazing footage found in nature, the lion chase (they take down an elephant), the polar bears, the caves, all of it was amazing. The only downside as others mentioned is the environmentalist bias in the last DVD. They use some good science, some junk science, thankfully the preaching is primarily kept isolated to the last DVD, however it does rear its ugly head in spots in the DVD's itself. Worth a look!

B000OMD4BG|5.0|Perhaps only Elliott Smith could generate an album's worth of \\"outtakes\\" and \\"rarities\\" that stand alongside even his most powerful work. At worst, New Moon is graceful. At its best, it's mesmerizing. The more I listen to this album, the more I think no one quite comes close to his balance of restraint, passion, intimacy, and splashes of baroque intensity. Not Samuel Beam, not David Gray, and certainly not the chronically overwrought Damien Rice. I think only Sufjan Stevens is on this level. And Smith didn't even think this stuff worthy of an album! The mind reels.<br /><br />Gorgeous guitar work, the classic doubled vocals (sometimes harmonized, even)... the \\"right beside you\\" sound is arresting at times. Ironically, the strength of this album *as* an album is the variety, where before Smith's releases were each notably unified in tone; this sometimes pushed his work to the brink of homogeneity.<br /><br />This guy was a folkie for the 21st Century. Like any great posthumous release, New Moon celebrates his strengths, over and over again. If there were any doubts, I think this one seals the deal. It's a keeper. It is quite unfortunate that the source of his genius was also apparently the source of his greatest darkness.

I am very impressed with Obama.

This book clearly demonstrates that Obama is not only highly intelligent but also deeply caring, introspective, and has spent a lot of time thinking through the issues. As someone who almost always votes Republican (for fiscal and militaristic reasons, I'm not conservative on the social issues), I would vote for Obama for President.

B00005JPAO|4.0|i am not a fan of the hanoversaxecoburggothawindsormountbatten family, but putting my political opinions aside, this is a fine and objective view of queen elizabeth II in the days surrounding the death of her ex-daughter-in-law diana.  faced with a public that chose to view a silly vapid little twit as some sort of beloved martyr, the queen was caught up in a sense of the world that had left her and the rest of her family behind.  the movie is a salute to a woman who managed to run a stall action, delaying the inevitable end of a monarchy thats only purpose in the world of the 21st century is to provide a tourist attraction.  the entire cast does wonders, esp of course helen mirren in her justifiably praised role as elizabeth, with a special nod as well to janes cromwell as the queens toady philip mountbatten.  and of course like all movies about british royals its fun to watch those sets. <br />
0684830515|4.0|There is no question that this is Hemingway's best literary effort. Other works are more politically appealing, informative or just plain readable but this story of some of the American and Europeon denizens of the post-World War I \\"lost generation\\" their trials, tribulations and inner horrors is literature in the grand style. A sparse story line and, on a quick reading, seemingly one-dimensional characters represented a break through in modern novel writing and won Hemingway his first just acclaim as an author. A second reading gives a much better understanding of just what ails this cast of characters and either gains our sympathy for their plight especially the narrator or makes us run away in horror at the futility of their lives. As an aside- in a novel this assortment of bedeviled characters make for great reading but in real life one would not want to spend more that about seven minutes with them. Being part of the 'lost generation' did not mean that one was exempt from the laws of boredom or being boring.       Okay, so much for the literary end now comes the real question. Who was better at getting to the core of post-World War I angst- Fitzgerald with his 'lost generation' in America or Hemingway with his 'lost generation' in Europe? That is a different question that the literary merits of Hemingway's work. Sorry, Ernest but Scott just had a flat out better ear for the pathos of that generation. Is there any better understanding of such tensions than The Great Gatsby? In consolation Ernest wrote better war stories. By far.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|I watched the movie last night on DVD and found it fascinating, but also quite disturbing and depressing.      The movie grabbed my attention from the opening scene, and quickly transported me to a dark \\"near future\\" that was full of pain, fear and despair. It's not exactly an uplifting film! I guess what is most disturbing about this film, is that the premis is not that far fetched and almost plausable. Great acting, direction and set design make this movie realistic and quite believable.      Other reviewers have commented that the film ends on an uplifting and postive note, but I didn't feel that way when the movie ended. Maybe that's why I only gave it three stars. Does anyone really feel good after watching a movie so negative and bleak about future of humanity?    Mike
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|this is the movie martin scorsese SHOULDA won his oscar for.  instead it was deemed upon its release an inferior copycat of \\"goodfellas\\", what with the same director, writer, and stars, and a similar set of circumstances.  this though is a quite different movie, and (imho) a superior one.  while \\"goodfellas\\" is set among a highly parochial little group, the gangsters are only a part of the scene in \\"casino\\": its much more widespread a saga of greed and the corruption of stupidity.  whereas joe pesci is a cartoon in the earlier film, here he is a fully fleshed out character.  de niro (more a glorified supporting character in \\"goodfellas\\") offers an insightful reading of an ordinary man with one phenomenal talent (the ability to set the correct odds) who parlays it into a position of power for which he knows he is unqualified, yet enjoys the ride.  and sharon stone gives the performance of her career as de niros unfaithful drug-addicted wife.  excellent supporting work also from james woods, don rickles, and a host of unknowns cast as aged mob bosses, &c.  not to mention a great job of art & costume direction, brilliant soundtrack, the amazing opening titles sequence, and so on.  it might not be scorses most underrated movie (thats still the hated but brilliant \\"king of comedy\\") -- but it might well be his very best.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|What a dissappointment for Hardcore rush fans like myself.MARLON review says it all!This new C.d lacks all the elements of a classic Rush album,Geddy's  new 'heavy vocals' lacks melody guess it's tough to meet the  signature high notes that made him one of the best vocalist of all time.  In this c.d they are just playing with no direction (no guitar solos)...Rush new path since 1984's Grace under pressure has been without direction, Rush never released an album after 1985's Power Windows that's worth listening through.  Geddy and Alex gelled great in the past in arranging  music  on all their classics 2112,Hemispheres,Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures and Grace Under Pressure while as usual Neil Peart was responsible for Lyrics.  My point is if you want a classic Rush release bring back TERRY BROWN to produce the Fu%#*)g c.d's!!!  I think most of the 5 star reviews are less than honest ones and these reviewers are hoping this c.d will sound good someday....Wait guys wait...Get the producer who is responsible for Rush sound and  their only,(1974-1984) ten years of success... TERRY BROWN!!!
B000053V7O|3.0|musician dexter gordon stars as the prototypical jazz man in this paean to its type.  while im usually bummed out by jazz-based movies (these people do take themselves waaaay too seriously), this one is saved by the honest portrayal essayed by amateur actor gordon, and a strong score.  of its ilk, its as good as ive seen. <br />
B000002AGM|1.0|The tape hiss is SO loud on this issue that it nearly obscures the brushes of the drum kit.  And the horns are terribly brassy and unnatural, \\"screaching\\" comes to mind.<br /><br />It's great music but this CD is a techical mess.

1416914285|3.0|Clary Fray is just an ordinary girl, til she's the only person in an all-age nightclub to see a murder and her mother disappears.  A mysterious stranger, just a bit over her 15 years, comes to her aid and plunges her into a world where 'all the stories are real.'  That includes demons, vampires, elves, etc.      The novel started out with a bang, but was too long to deliver the kind of speed needed to keep me hooked.  Clare's world is interesting.  Her concept that faeries are a result of angel and demon matings could explain a lot.  I also laughed at the ultimate bikers--vampires, who would have thought that?      She's assembled a good ensemble cast.  Clary's a likable kid who just wants her life back.  She's also the kind of young woman who can take care of herself.  One particular scene where she slaps Jace stands out strong in my mind. Simon, Alec, Isabelle and the rest of the crew are also interesting folks you can come to care about pretty quickly.      The imagery of her writing is good. It's obvious she's been strongly influenced by Chandler and Parker's noir detective novels.  My problem is, the Chandleresque material doesn't fit in as smoothly as it could with her own voice.      While \\"City of Bones\\" was acceptable, if I'm going to read more YA fiction, I'd much prefer the stronger writing of Holly Black.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|forty years ago a great young director named mike nichols made his film debut with a movie (\\"whos afraid of virginia wolff?\\" for those who dont know) about 4 lost lonely self-deluded people who are forced to confront the lies of their lives in one long night.  and now, rather than edward albee, we get someone calling himself patrick marber, who wrote both the screenplay and the play on which it is based, and has with nichols, (and four otherwise talented actors whose names i wont embarrass you and them and myself by listing)  succeeded in making one of the uglist most nasty movies i have ever seen.  these people could only exist in the minds of a misanthrope, and their stilted dialogue is evidence of his being an untalented misanthrope to boot.  women are [...] and deceivers, men are cads and betrayers, sex is a commodity, art is a farce, &c: if these are the lessons nichols has learned in 4 decades, i pity diane sawyer ...
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I wasn't sure Renee would be able to pull off the great Beatrix Potter!  But I was proven wrong.  She played the part brilliantly.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with its antics of Peter Rabbit pulling off his bow, the carriage that Beatrix's Mama and Papa went to the party in, and Jemima Puddle-Duck being told off for her silliness when Norman Warne was looking at her drawing!  What an imagination Beatrix had!  The characters of Beatrix, Millie and Norman were wonderful.  Ewan McGregor and Emily Watson were sensational as Norman and Millie Warne.  A movie to inspire and send us on a journey of our imagination. <br /> <br />I have been fortunate enough to visit the actual Hilltop Farm in Near Sawrey and would highly recommend to any one visiting the Lake District in the UK to go and pay a visit to the home of this famous author.  You can imagine in the garden that you see Peter Rabbit hopping around, or Jemima waddling along. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen the movie, it is one that I would highly recommend for all ages.
B00005JPCF|3.0|i liked this but not as much as i had hoped to.  in that its not unlike \\"march of the penguins\\".  i think penguins are cute and fun, but they dont seem to have the acting range of other animals, like bunny rabbits.  still, this is fun -- esprcially if you overlook some of the more blatant political posturing.  and its beautiful animation.  just wish there had been a little more \\"wallace & gromit\\"-type sensibility.  <br />
B000EQ47GS|5.0|If someone asked me to pick the best example of a great debut album then I would have to say Boston's first album. This album was the album to own when I was growing up. I knew kids in grade school who were on their 4th copy because they wore out the other three. You couldn't escape this record and you know what, that was ok because this is what a debut album should sound like. I believe the local radio stations played every track of the album. I had the cassette because I didn't have a record player so the sound quality wasn't that good but the songs really grabbed me. It wasn't till later when I was gainfully employed that a got a decent stereo system and a \\"ok\\" turntable that I was blown away by the production.<br /><br />This album had great guitar playing, great vocals by the late Brad Delp, great songs with great hooks, and musicianship to match. Not only that, 90% of the album was recorded and mixed in the basement of Tom Scholtz's house in Boston and not at a big expensive recording studio so add points for it being a mostly a DIY job from start to finish. Remember this was before the days of digital reverbs and porta-studios. So if you never heard it, get it. If your wore out that vinyl and want to upgrade, get it. Got it? Good
B00005K3OT|5.0|i stayed away from this movie all this time because i was scared off by the \\"chick flick\\" aura it had, but if this is a CF, bring on more like it!  set in a small french village in 1959, still not quite caught up with the modern world, juliette binoche stars as a single mother who wanders from place to place imparting the magical spells of chocolate, altering peoples lives while sadly not managing to alter her own.  the townsfolk include a repressed mayor (alfred molina) who is her main foe with his reliance upon traditional catholicism, and a slew of fine actors (lena olin, judi dench, john wood, leslie caron -- & isnt it grand to see HER?, &c) all of whom are eventually won over, as well as johnny depp, her counterpart as an irish rover who manages to settle her down, as she does him.  the movie is charming, funny, and gripping from end to end.  plus, how can you NOT like a movie that hails the merits of chocolate? <br />
B000000QFV|1.0|C'mon people this album SUCKS! I love Sabbath and no I am<br /><br />not one of those \\"If it don't have Ozzy it's not Sabbath<br /><br />crying kid\\" but I just do not feel anything for this album.<br /><br />I like Martin,he is a very good singer and I feel The Eternal<br /><br />Idol is a fantastic album. This however is flat too me.Anno<br /><br />Mundi and Valhalla are perhaps the best songs on here and<br /><br />thats sad for they are filler tunes at best.If you like<br /><br />Iommi solo projects than buy THE ETERNAL IDOL-HEADLESS CROSS<br /><br />and Seventh Star(though Stranger to love makes me ill)and<br /><br />stay away from this TURD.The fact Amazon does not sell this<br /><br />anymore and you have to purchase from private dealers say's<br /><br />it all.

B000HIVQD0|5.0|Pretenders first LP \\"Pretenders\\" once again re-released on CD. Geeze how many times does one have to buy the latest new improved sonic love so-called perfection? This time it works ..swell!  <br />A lot of us bought \\"Pretenders\\" went first out 1979. We were thrilled and thought YES  us!  Music for Us and our times... <br />I won't go over and over just how important it was at the time, how many boy's and girl's lifes changed from this beauty. History, both written and unspoken  is the legacy. <br />But!  This is a truly best mastered CD with crisp clear Chrissie vocals and eager guitar by James Honeyman Scott  deeply heard bass by Pete Farndon and pounding drums by Martin Chambers. Each classic track sounds like one was there at the time. <br /> <br />Disc 2   stuffed with demos like a BEATLE anthology. And respected the same. Sweet to hear \\"Stop Yr Sobbing\\" like an offering head on shoulder teen age girl, \\"Brass in  Pocket\\" like the ache fake bravado well put, + live versions of classics, \\"Mystery Achiement\\", \\"Precious\\", \\"Tattoed Love Boys\\".  <br /> <br />This is so much fun!!! <br />Chrissie won!
1582701709|5.0|It's got to be the best book I've read in a long time. It's very enlightening and really makes you think. I sent copies to all of my family.
B00008HCCF|5.0|this is the best video (from two 2003 year dvd and 2004 year dvd) - because there are all the best hits, \\"come away with me\\" and others, and the video is teken by good taste (good video operator and editor work), it is pleasure to watch, not like dvd from 2004 year. the bad thing is that both video are in very poor quality, video compresion makes it impossible to get good sight when loked on big tv, or projected on the wall. <br /> <br />sory for my weak english:)
B000GRUMPU|3.0|Ok I know I only gave it 3 stars but that is mostly because lets face it, this is a remake and you dont need a lot of brains to make a half decent film out of it.  still its better than the usual Japanese remake (lets hope after Dark Water (awful in Japanese what made them think it would be any better in English!)<br /><br />Same story line, better special effects (obviously!) Yeh the characters are nothing special but this film does have enough to keep your attention, the real negative is because the characters are nothing special you realy dont care who lives or dies.  Take one character in the film (bit of a spoiler for you) He makes a few nasty comments to Kurt Russell then dies horribly.  Now apart from the shock of how he dies you watch the film and frankly couldnt care less.<br /><br />Still, it has a little drama, the film is on just long enough to keep you entertained but not too long so your bored.<br /><br />Good for an evening in (when there is nothing on TV) You may want to rent this one, dont know about buying it (unless amazon is selling it cheap)
0743289412|2.0|Not your typical King read, in fact, I started to have a feeling that the beginning was written by his wife and that he finished it off. I felt like I was reading material written by a woman in the first half...then suddenly, it became a fast pace pretty good read. I am prejudice, I do seem to enjoy the male authors' more (with a few exceptions.) If you are looking for a good scare, this is not the book. If you are looking for a so-so read because you are bored with your life, then this is the book you want. Sorry to all of the King fans out there, this one just didn't do the trick for me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had become rather bored with TV space opera ever since the originasl Star Trek left the air. Over the years Space Opera on TV  had turned into a kind of Soap Trek from my perspective - boring stuff --I didn't want to live there. <br />It seemed like the future of endless possibilities that the original series had opened up had evolved into a kind of a soap opera: tied, duck taped and bound  by all the previous plots -- nothing new and too much starch and stretch in the uniforms. Then along comes Firefly to the rescue and opens up a whole new view and bunch of realistic possibilities on what our future could be like - why not horses, cattle and settlers - makes perfect sense -- don't it?  <br />It's a beautiful work of art tain't no use in complaining about there only being 14 episodes - better to praise what's been done. When your eating an ice cream cone don't complain the whole time that is is disappearing- just enjoy it. <br />
B00007KQA3|5.0|Indeeed, the movie is best viewed if you prior read the book . I remember I was every excited when it showed up because I was just finished reading the book and the concepts of \\"thought police\\", Big Brother, totaliatarian state, etc  were developing in my mind.. I read in the paper that Orwell's window was very much into the production seeing that the true spirit of the book was held at all times... and the movie does that at perfection level.<br /><br />In 1948 Orwell wrote the book to exptrapolate a world where fascism, comunism and other totalitarian forces gradually swept the world to create this dystopia... your thoughts are your own worst enemies.. they must be controlled by the message of the big-brothers and their sect of leaders in a hierarchical scale where beong a common citizen is the worst you can be .. uhmm any similarities with present state is purely coincidential<br /><br />That 90% of the world's population has lived in a state no different than the medival ages, that concepts such as freedom, civility are completly alien, that the few nations that upheld such values are becoming totalitarian, this alone will tell you that we humans are build to live in a primitive state, that scientific progress has nothing to do with enlightment of the soul... that this progress can be ruthfully exploited to make harder conditions on this primitive state...those are the thoughts that this marvel of cinema show us, it is a perfect parallel to what is happening today, of our legacy to our grandchildren.<br /><br />recursiveness, this is a theme xplored by Orwell that just barely now I have been able to see. The meticulous investigation into the control, manipulation and influence of human behaviour is a formidable task, yet, it is  here that no resources are wasted to carry out this at unimaginable levels, this experiment works, the brutal repression is over the point of corporal punishment for those who deviate, it has evolved into a \\"humanitarian\\" method of assimilation.. at the end, we can be like Winston at the end of the movie, frighten, concerned at what is being shown in the tv, wondering if as a society we are able to come through, and then the barman, comes up to us and offers us a shot of gin, it will be alright brother-<br /><br />I can understand why this movie is not available now; again call me a \\"conspiracy paranoid\\", but now is not the best time to question status-quo, now that hey are so focused on finding the enemy of terrorism within and abroad... I thought I never see the day that the USA would give up their freedom over to a group of neo-fascist, christian puritans to convert it gradually in a totalitarian state.. they go out agaist the taliban just as we are converting to a new talibanism... no civil rights if any suspision arises, I wait 4 hours in line trying to get in the US to spend my vacations there, to be considered; just by  being a foreigner, as a terrorist threat.. while at the same time in my country the whole systems marches to a Castro like state..  Is there a place in the world for free thought now?? Is anyone out there??? helloooo... sure hope Australia is still a land of free thought.... terrorist indeed won over, they have taken away by our consent our right to freedom<br /><br />I am amazed at the price and the fact that is not available here in Amazon, or is this part of the conspiracy as well!!<br /><br />Strange enough we see Hurt as the leader of a totalitarian England in V for Vendetta (which you can see my \\"polemical review\\" as well)can be like Winston at the end of the movie, frighten, concerned at what is being shown in the tv, wondering if as a society we are able to come through, and then the barman, comes up to us and offers us a shot of gin, it will be alright brother-     I can understand why this movie is not available now; again call me a \\"conspiracy paranoid\\", but now is not the best time to question status-quo, now that hey are so focused on finding the enemy of terrorism within and abroad...

B000000WCA|5.0|My life was meaningless. I had no friends. My D&D character died after a seven year run, and I still lived in the basement of my stepmoms house. All that changed with the release of SPICE. My quest for the answer has kept me busy now for over 10 years. The secret is in the album, and my Holy Grail is Baby Spice.<br /><br />Never have I seen such a beautiful woman. She is the object of all my desires. The perfect female specimen can be wrapped up in just two words 'Baby Spice'. When I first heard the song 'Naked' I was taken to a dream world. I listen to this album 14 times a day, everyday. And when I hear the song 'Naked', I become naked and always have the same vision, kneeling behind Baby Spice and using her pig-tails like the handlebars of a motorcycyle.<br /><br />Now for the album. I only share this with you because I have come to a point in my research where a partner is mandatory. I did not want to bring an outsider in, but for the love of Baby, I must. I must have Baby Spice all to myself, and I promise a great reward for anyone that can help me. If you can assist me in my quest, I promise you fame, power, and glory. All I seek is Baby Spice, the rest of the world is yours.<br /><br />SPICE is an acrynom, it stands for \\"Supernatural Place In Central Europe\\". I first discovered this after listening to 'If you can't dance' backwards. After more listens, I realized that SPice World is a real place and the peretual Baby Spice needs to be rescued. After wrapping my face in tin foil, sitting on a carrot, and listening to 'Love Thing', the vision was revealed to me as seen through a pink cloud. Baby is trapped in a tower in Prussia, as if that was not bad enough, a three headed dragon guards her.<br /><br />I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a plastic sword that glows in the dark. The voices told me I would need it. 'Who do you think you are' confirmed my belief that I was the knight to rescue Baby. Only the man that rescues her can fulfill the prophecy of '2 become 1'<br /><br />My quest is temporary on hold. I must find the 'yan uber gorrsay'. I discovered this after listening to 'Mama' from :23 to :27 of the song and then playing the last 14 seconds of 'Last Time Lover'. It was then I discovered that I must enter the 'Spice-rit World' never to return. I must bypass the gates of the Spirit World and locate the afterlife that contains all Spice. It is there that I find the Path of Spicage. I will follow it to the Spice Sea where the keeper will sail me to the Island of Spices. But for a ride on his boat I want answer the riddle \\"What do you really really want?\\" When I anwer the 'The love of Baby', my journy will continue.<br /><br />But to enter the Spice-rit World, I must find a person with Spice of heart and Spice of mind. He or she must split my skull with one blow with a hatchet, separating my left and right brain. Immediately after doing this, he or she must shove the CD directly into my split brain and then tape my head back together with duct tape.<br /><br />I ask all who are reading this listen to \\"Some Kind of Funny\\". Write down every tenth word and also include the 14th, 27th, and 56th word. When you have all the words written down, take the middle word and write down the last letter of the word. If that letter is also the first letter of your first name, then continue.<br /><br />With your list, take the first letter of the first word and write it down. On the next word, write dwn the 3rd letter. Alternate between 1st and 3rd letters of the words until you reach the end, but beware on the 6th, 9th, and 13th word, you must use the fourth letter. When all the letters are written down, arrange the letters so that it spells your name EXACTLY!!! First, middle, and last. If you can make out your exact name with no letters left over, you are the one I seek. Please contact me.<br /><br />I am serious, this world has nothing for me. I must rescue Baby to find my true happiness. She has been so lonely for so long, she needsher warrior to rescue her. It is my destiny to be with Baby Spice in a world where it is always 1997.o long, she needs her warrior to rescue her. It is my destiny to be with Baby Spice in a world where it is always 1997.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|It amazes amd amuses me to see this serie, its so well documented and cultured, you truly learn something about leadership, negotiation tactics, plain political manuvering... just for this, the series is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />I also wonder if this is not part of the sublimination of reality performed by the media movers to make the american public (and the worlwide for that matter) feel good about their current administration.. so much info overload, ugly reality, lets see the romantic side in the tv, its more comforting...<br /><br />If the US had the kind of leaders portraid here.. well you know..
B000OLRH1A|5.0|Very entertaining, Action Packed.  This film gets more indepth the setting across most of Africa during the civil wars that continue to rip the continent apart today.<br /><br />Also view Lord of War if you like this movie.
B000FS9FCG|3.0|This is a pleasant, provocative movie that is either an insult or satyre,  that I  have not discovered, or a manifestation of the collective aspirations of british fascism... as I learned by reading other reviewers, this movie comes from a graphic novel, so it does come from fertile ground for uncovering or exposing dark truths.<br /><br />Ideally this review should be read by having Pink Floyd's \\"Waiting for the worms\\"  (from The Wall) as background and melody that repeats at certain intervals.<br /><br />\\"Would you like to see Britannia<br />Rule again, my friend?<br />All you have to do is follow the worms.<br /><br />Would you like to send our colored cousins<br />Home again, my friend?<br />All you have to do is follow the worms.\\"<br /><br />So we are in Britannia some 30 years from present day. Unlike 1984, the dystopia state ruled by a fascist dictator (ironically played by John Hurt, which we all remember as Winston Smith in 1984 a movie censored nowdays) except that we are in a prosperous setting. If you look closely, this is not the multi-cultural London we know, if fact, this is a state where traditional anglo saxon virtues have been restored, it is George Bush's and all the neo conservatives dream land. What happened to the US? To me it was unclear, though a reviewer says that a brief hint in the movies makes it seem like it was destroyed in a civil war.<br /><br />Britannia is at this state in peace, the terrorist attacks of the past and the \\"dark years that followed\\" where unexplained purges took place, foreigners, islamics, homosexuals, dissenters were \\"relocated\\", disappeared or subjected to a series  of nazi like  human experiments where our mask hero seems to have acquired his feline, supernatural talents.<br /><br />Just for this setting, the movie should inspire us to reflect about the manipulative campaign of fear that today the USA and other powers are resorting to flirting with totalitarian \\"selective\\" methods. It is the Hobbean ruler that takes over the mind of the collective, which infinitely prefers totalitarism over anarchy. Even though the movie fails to create a coherent message of the rise of the new British fascism (apparently the only good thing that came out of this was the suppression of that bloody monarchy and all the pomp and circumstance that comes with it)  it does a good job at hinting, and showing us how over with time, homosexuals were persecuted, and islamophobic culture was instated, etc. (the racial cleansing or departures was apparently taboo even in this kind of setting, well, it is still Hollywood produced).<br /><br />But wait, our hero while using an English complot inspiration (some fellow who tried to blow up the parliament in the 17th century) is really a republican, Jeffersonian inspired... by being able to take over the only tv station in Britannia, he manages to wake up the conscience of the dormant herds that now yawn at their complacency in totalitarism, by inviting them for a sort of \\"peaceful and collective\\" resistance to the regime.<br /><br />When the bull smells, it smells, and the brits recognize the bull that the regime says right away, our hero is able to carry out his Count-of-Montecristo revenge against those who wronged him revelaing the putrid state of religion high rankers, scientist, etc. He picks up a girl (Portman) and teaches her how to face her fears until true courage emerges from the depths of despair.. in here there is a message to the young that is very appealing and I guess why the movie is so popular for the young (Note- if you are young and do not understand this review, read some books and get the facts before you start spewing out offensive comments, valid if you are old too).<br /><br />The message of hope spreads like wildfire and the promise to start a new order is achieved in a way that is rather weak to me, for the blowing of the parliament seems more like a terrorist dream than a protest that the true power resides in the people... the problems that the revolting brits do not seem to have much republican enthusiasm.<br /><br />So if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want  some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea.o if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want  some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|I am a huge fan of the entire Dune legacy. The films, the mini series... books (Frank Herbert's- haven't read the son's yet because it always tics me off when something good is dragged out long after the originator is gone... who knows if these books were part of Frank's vision- BUT I digress)<br /><br />Where was I, oh yeah. Love Dune. Though this version is not true to the book, it has some true merit. You have to remember that it is from the 80s and forgive the effects, but if you are looking for sort of a cliff notes version of the storyline, this is it. Just don't watch it in place the book and go to a book club thinking you know the story.<br /><br />Besides, you get to see all sorts of actors much younger than they are now, Patrick Stewart, Kyle M, Sting, and that dude from Quantam Leap just to name a few.<br /><br />Good movie fodder to watch, and who cares what happens next- for he is the Kwisatz Haderach.
6305949980|5.0|This is comment on the movie and not on the DVD product<br /><br />Indeed this is treasure that can be viewed from many angles, and I leave the cinema forum discussion open..<br /><br />My view on the excellent art:  Jack- the maestro extraordinaire of Halloween- in his maximum competence level- has found no longer \\"zest\\" in his own creation and admiration of his Halloween peers- similar to a mid-life crisis - he undergoes a minor depression looking for that change of pace.<br /><br />Wandering far and apart, the finds it by having a rare access to Christmas town- a community that same as holloweenland  spend s all its time and energies in preparing for the date .. and now, comes the decoding part of the story, how does a Halloween character interpret  x-mas? You guess it, a no brainer here.. X-mas has that Halloween taste.. Yet everyone is so excited nobody can notice it... now you can see how to use this movie for conflict issues... Jack also elevates to his maximum incompetence state (to put it into Dr. Peter's celebrated theory) by hijacking Santa in x-mas night... fortunately reality kicks back to reestablish balance and .. Well see it<br /><br />I thought I did not need any explaining on how to use this movie for conflict issues, so let's begin with the simple things as I would with my teenage son<br /><br />- Discovery of America by the Europeans-  Columbus could not even accept the possibility of a new world, this was India and the natives sure looked like Indians., in turn, when they saw the horses, what could they think of such wonderful beast, what names can they be given?... Venezuela was named because the Spanish saw some villages made over the waters of a lake, and they related to Venice..<br /><br />I could go on with Freud's theories of the psyche, etc but I am tired
B00005JPLW|5.0|Ok, forgive the simplicity of the review; I'll try to keep it short.<br /><br />This is one of the best, most original films I've seen in a long time! I have just a couple of things I'd like to mention...<br /><br />In response to the negativity surrounding the \\"historical accuracy\\" of the movie and the way it portrays Persians, I'd like to point out that this movie is a narrative from the point of a Spartan who viewed Persians as the enemy.<br /><br />Just like with any war propaganda, the \\"perceived\\" enemy is portrayed as the... wait for it.. BAD GUY. That's because, in the eyes of the Spartan narrating the story, he is. Why would the narrator want to portray the bad guys as well rounded, nice, and approachable individuals from a progressive society that is making wonderful... yeah. whatever.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Persians are bad, or that the portrayal was \\"right.\\" I'm saying it was the narrative point of view to the story, and integral to understanding the point of view for the Spartans(in the movie).<br /><br />Also, something to mention- if you like action (good action), and great cinematography, and useful dialog... visual candy, amazing sound, originality, and the feeling that the people making this film actually put some time, and effort into giving a good show, then check it out for yourself.<br /><br />Me, I love this MOVIE! I will own it the day it is released on DVD...
B000002MG1|3.0|This was a massive success, completely dwarfing even Out of Time - not to mention each of the group's previous albums - in terms of units moved. And I can see why. It's a very accessible collection, much easier to listen to than the murky early records. And Stipe's clearly enunciating his words, rather than mumble his way through. Which is where the controversy sets in. Depending on who you ask, Automatic is either a brilliant masterwork of an album, among the best R.E.M. ever put out, or it's an abomination. At first I put it in category 2 - initially, only Man on the Moon and Everybody Hurts grabbed me. Now I think it occupies the vast territory between the two, much like Green.<br /><br />The beginning and end of this record are as strong as any - the orchestrated Drive sets the tone nicely, and the ballad Try Not to Breathe continues to. I assume you've heard The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite (AKA callmewhenyoutrietowakeher), and it's a brilliantly stupid song. And if you've turned on the radio for the past decade you know Everybody Hurts, which is brilliant but NOT stupid - a surprisingly emotional power-ballad. Great, great, GREAT song.<br /><br />You might as well skip straight ahead to track ten, though, because there's nothing of value coming for a long stretch. New Orleans Instrumental #1, Sweetness Follows, Monty Got a Raw Deal, Ignoreland, Star Me Kitten... No, no, no. What are they doing here? Get rid of 'em all. In fact, let's forget they ever existed.<br /><br />Okay, now we can get back to the good stuff. Man on the Moon was overplayed as hell back in the '90s, but circa 2007 it's much easier to appreciate the mature lyrics, deeply layered harmonies, and the song's atmosphere. I think this is my favorite off the album, maybe even the group's best of the '90s. Love it. Same with the lush, nostalgiac Nightswimming, the fourth ubergiganto radio hit. Another favorite of mine. And Find the River brings the whole thing to a lovely close.<br /><br />So, not a bad album, and thankfully there's nothing as bad as Shiny Happy People or Stand. But this is unbelievably far from R.E.M.'s greatest achievement - even if it kicks the crap out of Out of Time.ully there's nothing as bad as Shiny Happy People or Stand.

B000000W5F|3.0|Amazon really needs to consider some alternatives to the five star ratings. It is simply too easy to lump a variety of albums into one category even though they may differ slightly. It's the difference between a B+ and a B- if you will - sorry, it's the teacher in me. I would make this a 6 if it were a 10 point scale, opposed to Dirty Work or Emotional Rescue or Black and Blue being 7s. It's good but not a Stones cd that I play all the time. I play other eighties Stones albums more than this if that gives you any perspective.<br />What I used to really like about this recording was that, in the vinyl days, one side was rock, the other slower songs. It was kind of cool that you could choose your mood and play the side to fit. Granted, you can do the same now as the pacing is not changed, but I just wanted to point out that geezer factoid. I tend to like the slower side best. There are some really great songs there and Mick is in fine form.<br />The rocking side has the more familiar numbers including Start Me Up which can make the unique claim of having its opening riff being universally accepted as a sports icon. In sports arenas around the globe, Keef's opening hammer-on chording signals the faithful to get up and cheer the home team. Not many musicians can make that claim - not that they'd want to, either. It is a fast-paced and typical Stones rocking cadre of songs and it won't disappoint even the casual Stones fan. Ronnie's contribution of Black Limousine is the highlight for me. I love the Stones doing the blues.<br />Many call this the last great album or some such label and I disagree. All Stones albums since the 70s have to be taken at face value - they have some good and some average and even some bad. Yet, it's the Stones and that always makes me happy.
B000001EXR|4.0|This is possibly KISS' most ummm...... \\"interesting\\" albums yet.  They've decided to try to blend their music for the style that was popular at the time, which was Grunge, Industrial, and Punk.  They do manage to get some of their classic sounds in, but not much.  This earns them three stars, plus another star for featuring Bruce Kulick on lead vocals on the track \\"I Walk Alone\\".
B000NVIXFK|5.0|The very fact that every new Rush album has us saying \\"What is this???\\" is the very reason Rush rules. These guys are always evolving. Period.  <br /> <br />I've never bought a Rush album that I liked the first listen and I own them all. It took repeated listens to figure out where they were at mentally and musically when they recorded. After having listened to Snakes and Arrows numerous times, I'm feeling that old familiar thrill of \\"getting it\\". I love that feeling. I love hearing those bizarre melodies and odd time signatures popping spontaneously in my head and saying what song was that? <br /> <br />Admittedly, I lament a little sometimes when they veer off from a style I particularly love. I was less than ecstatic when \\"Roll the Bones\\" followed \\"Presto\\". But the album was still cool. And ultimately, it's not my music - it's theirs! Ridicule away, but Rush has never done anything but continue to make the music that they want to make which is why they are great. These are the same guys who gave us \\"Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"YYZ\\" after all.  <br /> <br />I find it amazing that every Rush fan has a different favorite album. Of course \\"Moving Pictures\\" is classic and most lightweight Rush fans own that one, but you won't find that at the top of every fan's list. \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is bound to be at the top of somebody's. It's good stuff.  <br /> <br />I don't know why other people don't think so, but their seventies style is very much at work here. \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" have elements that could have been straight off of \\"2112\\" or \\"Fly By Night\\". Yet at the same time, they are 25+ years older with a whole anthology of music behind them so it's not *identical*.  <br /> <br />It's something new altogether. And after 30+ years of Rush, that is exactly what I expected.  <br /> <br />Keep rockin' boys!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|As a long, long-time Rush fan, I was, of course, thrilled to acquire yet another album.  I had been listening to \\"Far Cry\\" (the single) for several weeks, and was pretty excited to hear the rest. <br /> <br />For the most part, the boys from up north have delivered!  There are some true gems on this album...particularly lyrically.  I wouldn't say this is one of their best albums ever, but it doesn't sit near the bottom either.  It is certainly a very solid effort, clearly indicating that these guys are not resting on any laurels.  What other major rock group that's been around for 30 years is still producing albums people want to hear? <br /> <br />My favorites:  \\"Far Cry\\" is the single, and it's easy to see why. It's the most immediately accessible, although I find the first 45 seconds or so to be a weak attempt to copy the bombast of \\"One Little Victory,\\" the song that kicked off \\"Vapor Trails\\" 5 years ago.  It's the boys playing loud, to kind of the get the blood pumping...but it's a little flat.  Once the song itself kicks into gear, it's very good.  \\"Spindrift\\" is a very evocative song...Neil Peart at his most poetic.  \\"Faithless\\" is good, but I am just a smidge tired of Peart beating the dead horse about his lack of faith.  I'm fine with the sentiment...but after the incredible \\"Freewill\\" 25 years ago...little more can be added.  The album finale is \\"We Hold On\\" and I found it to be very emotional.  It is sad in the way it talks about how we all desire a change, to walk out on our lives for something else...but how we also \\"hold on\\" and go on.  It was a bittersweet but very appropriate ending. <br /> <br />For me, the REAL treats are the instrumentals.  There are 3:  \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is somewhat forgettable...but \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is without a doubt their best instrumental since YYZ.  It's nothing like YYZ...but it's a sweeping, epic tune that shows their tunecrafting and instrumental prowess very, very well.  I've listened to that track more than any other.  \\"Hope\\" is, for me, the long awaited acoustic guitar solo from Alex Lifeson...the one I've been waiting for ever since the little throwaway track \\"Broon's  Bane\\" from the EXIT STAGE LEFT live album.  It is a little, 2 minute delight! <br /> <br />For me, the only throwaway song is \\"Armor and Sword\\" a musically and lyrically ponderous piece.  I felt the same way about \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" on VAPOR TRAILS.  Just a little too heavy-handed.  But easily forgiven, considering all the other gems here. <br /> <br />There are still better albums to use to introduce a novice to RUSH...but frankly, SNAKES & ARROWS wouldn't be half bad.  For devoted fans like me...I would give it 4.5 stars.  (And I even really like all the album artwork...except for the cover itself.  Some great photographs!) <br />
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is an atheist, a professor who specializes in evolutionary biology and writing books about it and a debater who concentrates on... well... making theologians, especially Christian ones, feel completely disconnected from reality because of their so-called `delusions'. Richard Dawkins is not a theologian, but sometimes he tries to be. Nobody can blame him for trying, but how does it bode when he gets something wrong and is trying to sell science at the same time? It either increases scientific awareness or it completely does science recruitment harm by making believers feel as if they may not be able to do both and Dawkins is clear, if now downright adamant, that it is either science or religion, not both. Atheist scientists are thus the end product of Dawkins school of thought. There is no two ways about it. This is his position.<br /><br />This book is considered a development of Dawkins challenge to religion, something that began with his BBC Horizon TV programs rebuttal to creationism (the Blind Watchmaker) to now an outright disdain for religion. Even some of Dawkins friends, such as Dan Dennet, have said that Dawkins has gone too far with The God Delusion and in many ways I would agree.<br /><br />At its most extreme Dawkins really might be challenging parts of the universal declaration of human rights on the freedom of religion when it comes to the profession of science. Dawkins may be implying that scientist can only be real scientists if they are also atheists without exception. Imagine if this argument (and it is an argument he makes by criticizing all scientists, like Stephen Jay Gould for example, who make any positive or neutral comments on religion) actually gained favor in the legal system. It means that a religious scientist could no longer give expert witness testimony as atheists where prevented from doing in the past. Should Atheism really be promoting an eye for eye policy? This is one big critic of the whole book. Dawkins seems to be going for an all or nothing here. Saying he is an atheist and that science is more interesting than religion is one thing. Blaming religion on everything is quite another.<br /><br />While Dawkins says this book is aimed at people who want to quit religion but don't know how to do it, it is obvious that he is also indirectly aiming his arguments to the sober Christian mind. Noticeably Dawkins is selecting his new prodigy from the Christian gene pool. Here he can find fresh brains. Clear-headed tee-totaling moderates are actually interested enough in the world to give him a second thought. Who else does Dawkins think he can lecture to? ...Crack addicted illegal bookies who might casually murmur about belief in a God when high? The only cell they will ever see is a prison and not the kind under the microscope. Dawkins has firmly found his base with thoughtful serious Christians, not with those who practice self-interest and dishonesty and frankly that is the atheist majority. Dawkins is trying desperately to disassociate atheism with that. It seems that all he can do though is separate the Dawkins from that lot... and so hard he tries... until he has an anti-religion flip out. This book is a big one of those.<br /><br />A happy religious person is going to be offended by this book. The same happy religious person who is interested in science would maybe do much better to consider a different Dawkins book on biology and or, Origin of the Species by Darwin or some modern books on biology, paleontology and geology. If you are religious and want science then go there because here you are only going to get heavy anti-religion mixed with some science. This is Dawkins in his post-`The Root of all Evil' form. It is Dawkins not quite like some have seen him before. His allergy to religion is on hyper in this book.<br /><br />The God Delusion is about anti-religion, but it incorporates science. His arguments are from philosophy (atheism), biology (natural selection) and physics (cosmology). Anyone who actually studies religion will realize that Dawkins talks about it from a critical and limited point of view. Dawkins does present basic mistakes which religious apologists correct daily. Anyone could double check his assertions on the internet and discover the apologetics that refute him. For example Dawkins makes the common error from inexperience that the New Testament Gospels writers use only the Hebrew (pp.96) when in fact they use and quote from the Greek Septuagint (the LXX... and yes they use the term virgin, not young woman). Dawkins quotes the 1909/1912 encyclopedia of Catholicism (pp.32) instead of the stance of post-Vatican II Catholicism (1962-1965), found in the 1997 Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC). There are theologies that hold that God remains unseen (Pope Benedict XVI as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger in `Introduction to Christianity' to name one) but they don't get any coverage here. Dawkins does not study up on any one religion in detail but plays selective apologetics. If Dawkins wants to critic Christianity he uses the apologetics of Judaism and Islam. If he wants to critic Islam then he uses the apologetics of Christianity and Judaism. This might seem smart at first but ultimately it shows that he is just using debate tactics and is not really presenting the reader with a proper understanding of religion... yet this is about the God Delusion! Why would he want to bother presenting religion if he thinks it the result of deluded minds? It seems if you can't prove the supernatural then why bother treating it seriously. Yet remaining outside of proof maybe what faith in the unseen is all about.<br /><br />The TGD is primarily aimed at people who are sick of their own religion and especially tired of fundamentalism in their own religion. To this end TGD will distort religion in order to give these people the extra nudge they need to give up religion. What these people actually need is for their religion to be explained to them by `responsible theologians' who understand their religion in relation to the world today and the implications of science since 1859. Dawkins however is adamant that such coexistence between religion and science is wrong and fraudulent.<br /><br />Ambiguously presented it seems the publisher can freely class TGD as fiction tomorrow. No genre description on the spine or rear, the product description is vague. The book's beginning chapters appear to be a combination of the works `Atheism: The Case Against God' by George H. Smith (without credit in this book) and Carl Sagan's (who is credited) book and television series `Cosmos'.<br /><br />Given that this book is aimed at converting believers over to atheism, believers who know their own religion will be hard pressed to believe what science and philosophy he offers between the pages of just getting religion wrong. If he doesn't understand it why does he still present himself as scientific? That is a big problem a learned reader will come away with. To this extent this kind of reader is more engaged in keeping track of the references cited and written works rather than Dawkins commentary on them and this is the key reason to read this book. There are a number of interesting names and book titles dropped along the way. It seems that Dawkins is a big player in the evolution vs. intelligent design literature/debate but his coverage of theology is very surface skimming and most of the time misdirected. He often quotes Swinburne on Saint Aquinas and Swinburne has clearly misread/misunderstood Aquinas as has Dawkins with his own paraphrasing of the Summa Theologica. This is just all bad theology laid out and attacked. It is strawman whether Dawkins knows it or not. I actually believe Dawkins thinks he is going down the right direction but checking his sources shows otherwise. There are many instances where he disproves an argument and then forwards the same argument himself. For example, Dawkins argues that advancedcivilization can be Godlike, but this is a version of the ontological argument as covered in pp.69.<br /><br />TGD is dedicated in memoriam to Douglas Adams, a close friend of Dawkins, who died an Atheist in 2001.<br /><br />Chapter 1 introduces great modern thinkers (usually dead ones), wins them as fellow atheists, done in response to religious writers who won them as fellow believers. Omits that the Saints can be quote mined tomorrow for the periods of atheism they experienced. Einstein is the big fish toyed with here. Benjamin Franklin is also quote mined.<br /><br />Chapter 2 lashes out at the wickedness of the God of the Holy Bible without mentioning the good, proposes that America is based on secularism alone (pp.38), admonishes agnostics for not being atheists (pp.46) and lists a pop chart spectrum of belief types (pp.50) but omits the lesson that faith is a developed condition in light of the normal belief/unbelief condition of a human being. Dawkins reprimands scientists for mentioning God (what does he propose? Lifting the unmentioned criticized scientist out of his wheelchair and dunking him in a bathtub for writing about the mind of God?). Dawkins correctly asserts that religions do make scientific claims such as historical claims but avoid philosophical and scientific claims that do not fit their belief structure. He does this by attacking Gould's NOMA (non-overlapping magisterium) (pp.54). Some of the arguments for God he covers are also rejected by theologians but Dawkins omits this. Dawkins says prayer experiments prove prayer does not work (pp.61) but omits the impact prayer has on the person praying. Dawkins argues that advanced civilizations can be better through science, if not God-like, without mentioning that our advances can also destroy us, such as global atomic war. However it is hard to imagine human beings today completely rejecting science from their lives. Even the Amish have clothes and use wheels.<br /><br />Chapter 3 has Dawkins odd paraphrasing of the introduction chapters of the Summa Theologica by Saint Thomas Aquinas (pp.77). The originals are how they should be presented. Section 1 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church also does a more complete job including divine revelation. Dawkins doesn't disprove the proof of the eternal (yes, no beginning) unmoved mover, but he correctly asserts that nobody can prove it is intelligent or even existing anymore. Dawkins limits a priori arguments to just the ontological argument with no mention of revelation through the prophets or Christ. I think this aspect in Catholicism is huge with a historical record that should be looked at, yet again Dawkins probably sticks to his `prove the supernatural before I go asking deeper questions about it' guns. Gasking's reduction is interesting in light of the idea that God is primarily unseen (yes, meaning undetectable not just invisible, except for special revelations). Dawkins argues that an experience of God could still be mistaken because we can't trust our senses but omits that he trusts his own rationality for his position of disbelief. Dawkins quotes book writers as the source for Biblical discrepancies (pp. 93) but omits that it is the clergy and theologians of the Catholic Church who have presented, and explained (omits their clarifications also) these historical discrepancies (they use the historical critical method). He does mention two very important criticisms. The God of the gaps argument (where people claim a mystery equates to God... until the mystery is explained) and the unscientific claims of irreducible complexity.<br /><br />Chapter 4 has Dawkins toasting himself with the argument from improbability that God doesn't exist. You cannot but help think at how his argument doesn't say God is impossible. It just says more improbable than the already highly improbable state of our own existence. God only needs 1 chance in the same argument.<br /><br />Chapter 5 has some good explanations for the evolution of religion. It is my understanding that maybe this is a recap of Dennet's book Breaking the Spell. I am inclined to want to read that book because of this chapter. The chapter is good, however Dawkins brings in the subject of memes and this is from another book of his called The Selfish Gene. I am inclined to want to read that book so I think Chapter 5 is loosely designed to get the reader to want to read those two books for a deeper understanding of what is presented. This chapter I feel is hard to understand without a foundation in the laws of inheritance and Darwinian evolution. It is for those who have experienced Dawkins views on evolution before.<br /><br />Chapter 6 seems to be based on Sam Harris' Letter to a Christian Nation. It basically makes you want to read that book. The arguments about religion and morality are extremely good.<br /><br />Chapter 7 is Dawkins picking the worst parts out of the OT and NT, forgetting the historical context and just laying it all out to shock today's politically correct person. In this way he does a job on fundamentalists but theologians with historical-critical coverage will maybe raise an eyebrow at worst. Religion isn't a vacuum from a book (there is a lot of common sense which we get from our friends) and it is doubtful that people actually live their lives completely that way, but he presents it like it is. There are other factors apart from religion and I feel he doesn't give those aspects enough coverage. It is all religion's fault according to Dawkins. On the topic of the religion of Hitler, the man was a liar. Hitler lied about anything to get his way. His two-face position is clear from the record. That point needed to be pressed more. However Dawkins is right about atheism from knowledge (such as cosmology). Why should his disbelief make him a madman like Hitler or Stalin? Dawkins is trying to give atheism a good name and in this he is somewhat successful although not avoiding the same `anti this and that' bias as he criticizes in religion.<br /><br />Chapter 8 is a very good argument against the politically incorrect historical biblical positions that still survives today. The subversion of other views, absolutism and the condemnation of sexual orientations are obvious difficulties. However Dawkins goes into how murder is acceptable to some people if it is done in the name of God, yet most people around the world, regardless of religion, know that these things are wrong. I think he doesn't give coverage to common sense which does prevail. Still Dawkins argues that it is still their fault because they allow their own religion to be subverted. This is a tricky topic. Blaming the religion of Islam for OBL is what Christian fundamentalists do.<br /><br />Chapter 9 is a very good chapter about some things that religions do, or have done, to children, especially on the teachings of hell and the psychological manipulation that goes on in religions. This aspect of religion is changing however through awareness and it is people like Dawkins who are helping to make that awareness known as well as psychiatrists and psychologists whom the clergy as pressed to learn from. In a way he is right about the freedom to choose and that people who base their lives on a fear of hellfire and brimstone often psychologically abuse people because they have been brought up this way. These psychological aspects deserve the admonishing he gives them. See Aggiornamento.<br /><br />Chapter 10 is consolation for the person who needs to let their brain take a rest from the fundamentalism they have been indoctrinated with. Dawkins talks a person through all the psychological aspects of leaving religion and getting on with their lives without God. He explains how there is no need to be worried about death and how it will be as if one had never existed at all. He is also right that life outside of fundamentalism reveals a lease of life and renewal of life that a person may never have experienced before. However Dawkins uses science as his means to stay afloat. Can we all be scientists? It seems we can if we work hard and have enough money to spend on getting the education or material, yet for some people the thought of spending their remaining years doing this is too hard. In many ways Dawkins is offering no easy solutions. Science is still hard work. Learning something else is hard work. The person must find an interest elsewhere to keep going somehow. He leaves the reader with a list of web sites and help groups at the end, so it is not as if they are alone.<br /><br />However is Dawkins really right about not believing in the possibility of a supernatural God anymore? What he does is to strip away all the statements people can make about such a God. The stripping is done by scientific replacement therapy, in this case to fulfil the wishes of Hawkings to have a complete description of the universe and everything in it. Natural selection and the other mechanisms of evolution when understood (in their original atheistic way) are a very powerful tool, more powerful that TGD could ever hope to be. Complex organisms developing in order (not randomly as most people mistakenly think) by natural means of the environment impacting on the genotype and the genotype impacting on the environment is more powerful an argument against the idea of God having a hand in creation then anything Dawkins comes up with. Really this book is a big nod to Darwin for getting it all going (and Dawkins is never short in giving him his due) but is not the Dawkins book for evolution (there are better Dawkins books on this topic). This is primarily an anti-religion book. If evolution doesn't give the theist sleepless nights, then either the theist doesn't understand the atheism that evolution naturally entails or his own doctrine. Theistic evolution is not science. To that end there is something rather emotional about coming to this conclusion. Despiritualization is depressing at times. When everything is being explained then there appears to be no room for anything other than the way it just is.<br /><br />I look forward to reading his other books. I hope he does reconsider his methods though and drops the amateur theology.7). The originals are how they should be presented. Section 1 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church also does a more complete job including divine revelation.

However is Dawkins really right about not believing in the possibility of a supernatural God anymore? What he does is to strip away all the statements people can make about such a God. The stripping is done by scientific replacement therapy, in this case to fulfil the wishes of Hawkings to have a complete description of the universe and everything in it. Natural selection and the other mechanisms of evolution when understood (in their original atheistic way) are a very powerful tool, more powerful that TGD could ever hope to be. Complex organisms developing in order (not randomly as most people mistakenly think) by natural means of the environment impacting on the genotype and the genotype impacting on the environment is more powerful an argument against the idea of God having a hand in creation then anything Dawkins comes up with. Really this book is a big nod to Darwin for getting it all going (and Dawkins is never short in giving him his due) but is not the Dawkins book for evolution (there are better Dawkins books on this topic). This is primarily an anti-religion book. If evolution doesn't give the theist sleepless nights, then either the theist doesn't understand the atheism that evolution naturally entails or his own doctrine. Theistic evolution is not science. To that end there is something rather emotional about coming to this conclusion. Despiritualization is depressing at times. When everything is being explained then there appears to be no room for anything other than the way it just is.    I look forward to reading his other books. I hope he does reconsider his methods though and drops the amateur theology.
0385336942|5.0|I read this novel several years ago and have been haunted by it ever since.  It is a beautifully lyrical morality play, chronically the maturation and corruption of an 'innocent'.  Drawing allusions from Christian, Hindu and native American myths (the balloon man as 'angel', trickster, magicians and healers, redeeming prostitute, etc.), the author has woven a magical tale.  One has to look only a bit deeper than the surface story to learn and marvel at this book.  Not to be missed...
B000001FNL|5.0|I just recently found a copy of this at the local church sale.  At the moment I didn't know it was a hard find.  I did know that when I had a vinyl copy in my youth, it blew me away.  Going backwards in time it not always a good thing for a pop music lover.  In this case, I just couldn't believe how great the Gibbs were at this point in their career.  The production is clean, the songs complex, and the harmonies are ones only these three brothers could pull off.  The hits from the cd sound wonderful so many years after the fact, and the less famous numbers are simply beautiful. Along with the BG's first, this is my favorite of their albums.
0895260131|5.0|Very interesting and scary at the same time to the mindset of the Islamic religion.
B000002MX7|5.0|After listening to every track on this album, I can truly say that the artist has REALLY put her heart into this work of art.  Especially great is the track #10, Through The Fire.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys a terrific voice and great instrumentals.  It is well worth the cost and the time spent listening...
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I still don't know how these guys manage to come up with tunes that sound unique and refreshing but have a style that can't be duplicated and is somehow all their own.  I bought this album ironicaly with another album with snakes on the cover (Meshuggah's Catch 33), and well they have nothing in common (actually that's not totally true).  I couldn't resist mentioning that...    Snakes and Arrows is many times wildly creative but also a little too hectic.  They are great songs, and there are the songs that seem like half an idea that wasn't quite finished.      Musically it sounds fantastic and Alex really gets to shine on this album, throwing in all sorts of instruments.  Ironicaly it's the musical instramentals of which there are 3 on this album that are probably the best material.    Lyrically, the themes deal with personal introspection for the most part, gone are subjects that don't have to deal with well.. yourself, some of the lyrics though come out a bit awkward with the music at time, I still can't get past the first verse and line of 'armor and sword' it almost doesn't even make sense the way Geddy sings it.    The good news is (no pun intend and a great track) there is plenty of material to keep the fanboys entertained.  And it's probably better than 70% of the musical product that is being released right now.      Also kudos on the cover and art work it looks great.    I'll let you all fight over what is the best/worst album period/hair/producer/era for the band amongst youselves.  I won't agree with you and you won't agree with me.. and that's fine...
B0000A0DRY|5.0|When Pillow was released in 1966 it was in the vanguard of the West Coast psychedelic movement. Those of us who immediately seized upon the Airplane as unique and exciting have probably played this record hundreds of times. As I listen again tonight I wonder whether I can be at all objective. For instance, one fellow reviewer referred in his review to the two Marty Balin ballads, Today and Comin' Back to Me as \\"cheesy.\\" I have always really loved these songs. However, were I hearing them today for the first time would I, too, dismiss them as lightweight pieces of fluff? Of course it is impossible to say. It is just a thought!<br /><br />Jefferson Airplane was truly a collaborative effort. Of the band members Jack Casady alone has no writing credits.  Only he and the drummer Skip Spence do not participate in the vocals. The scope of the music is very wide. The record features the aforementioned ballads, straight rockers and folk rockers along with the famous psychedelia of White Rabbit. One of the additional tracks, In the Morning, reveals that the band could do a very creditable job on a bluesy song.<br /><br />Surrealistic Pillow was one of the great LPs of the sixties. It is most definitely a record of and for the times. It could only have been released between late '66 and early '68. It  captures for me  the genesis of one of my favourite periods of music - the fabulous West Coast psychedelic era - the heady days of Grateful Dead, Quicksilver, Moby Grape and The Doors. The music does, at times, sound a little dated. This is hardly surprising. After all, it was recorded over forty years ago. To put this in perspective one has only to realize that the first talking movie was released just thirty-nine years before Pillow!
1932100660|5.0|This is a well written summary citing extensive statistical research that makes a very convincing case that the typical American diet is the direct cause of our high rates of obesity, heart disease, diabeties, and cancer. It shows that we can drastically reduce the incidence of these diseases by simply decreasing our consuption of animal based foods and increasing our consumption of plant based unprocessed whole foods. The diet change the author proposses is highly difficult and will require a stong commitment, but the good health that results will be more than worth the effort. Highly recomended for someone committed to making healthy changes in their life.

B000IJ79WU|3.0|This cut of Superman II is hugely better than the theatrical release. My only complaint is that with the DVD version, the picture quality is quite poor (the quality is better than the DVD version of the theatrical version of Superman II). I would recommend purchasing this film on Blu-Ray or HD-DVD disk.
0060832819|4.0|I bought Zahir when it first launched and then put it on my book shelf.  Two days back I suddenly picked it up to read and just finished reading it today.  Unlike eleven minutes, this book is more like Paulo Coelho 's style.  When you are in a miserable time especially in the relationship crisis or breakup, you will be inspired by Zahir.  The search for self and broadening perspectives in life instead of being pity for self can always drive us to move on.

It does, however have a few redeeming qualities, such as the beautiful music and very beautiful scenery, for the setting.

B00000G6TL|5.0|If all you're looking for a good place to start?, this is a very good Deep Purple greatest hits collection.<br /><br />I would say that this is by far you're best bet when it comes to a single disc hits package. It has classic purple as well as some of the newer stuff with Mr. Morse on guitar. It also sounds far superior to any of the other hits packages out there I've heard so far. Most of the bigger hits are found on here and for what it is, it's pretty darn good.<br /><br />Is it missing stuff?, you bet it is, lots of really good stuff like Lazy, Maybe I'm a Leo, Knocking At Your Back Door, The Mule, Space Trucking? etc, but it's still the best single disc yet!
B000002IQ9|4.0|Incredible stage, amazing music and a very entertaining Phil Collins in one of his best massive concerts ever.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Well, maybe not so literally. Still, the CD cover image, an ancient Indian game about self-knowledge represented by Snakes and Arrows, is apt for the subject matter. The sequence of songs does sound like a kind of spiritual journey through many trials and tribulations.<br /><br />Snakes and Arrows is a welcome addition to Rush's long line of solid albums. It is sonically and stylistically an evolution from Rush's most recent albums, especially Test for Echo and Vapor Trails. Varied arrangements, captivating melodies, passionate singing and vibrant choruses characterize the songs. Although much of the album has a moderate tempo, the instrumentation does have moments of busyness that are reminiscent of older Rush albums. However, that's not to say you can expect to hear Moving Pictures part II. It's more of a relaxed kind of clutter.<br /><br />The songs have a lush, \\"natural\\" feel because of all the acoustic guitar Alex Lifeson plays on them. He also returned to playing guitar solos, something he mainly took a break from on Vapor Trails.<br /><br />The lyrics are often gloomy and disturbing and tend to arouse strong emotions. But they come short of wallowing in despair. Themes such as adversity, struggle, hope, faith, and perseverance tie the songs together. A few of the songs cover controversial topics dealing with religious belief and current political events. They make ample use of symbolism based on naturally occurring phenomena.<br /><br />Among the highlights of the album are the opening track, \\"Far Cry,\\" which is an upbeat and characteristically Rush-sounding song. \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" appears to be based on memoirs of some of Neil Peart's many travels. \\"Spindrift\\" begins with eerie sounds that give way to a heavy guitar riff that resembles menacing waves crashing on a shore. \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is the longest of three instrumentals on the album. It has some intense parts and similarities to previous Rush instrumentals, especially \\"Where's My Thing\\" and \\"Limbo.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" is my favorite track. It starts off with a marching snare drum, which leads surprisingly to a passionate, bluesy guitar melody. The lyrics are critical of religious fundamentalists in both the east and the west. What's fascinating is the imagery used to describe the situation of people caught between the warring sides. In any case, it's just an awesome tune.<br /><br />\\"Faithless\\" is even more critical of religion, and particularly of what some people do in the name of religion. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is one of the other instrumentals, on which Geddy Lee plays a rocking bass groove that has an Indian/Middle-Eastern vibe. Finally, \\"We Hold On\\" is a kicking album closer.<br /><br />All in all, I think Snakes and Arrows is a strong album. If you're a hardcore Rush fan, you already own it and probably love it. It's a 9 out of 10 for you.<br /><br />Having said that, it does take a number of listens for most of the songs to sink in. Some people may be turned off by the battery of negative lyrics. The songs have an almost unrelenting tension that doesn't seem to be satisfactorily \\"resolved\\" even in the last track. Although that was probably the intention, it leaves an incomplete feeling to the album. (Maybe there will be a Snakes and Arrows Part II?)<br /><br />For these reasons, the fairest rating I can give it for everyone else is a 7.5 out of 10.<br /><br />But beware: the SNAKES and ARROWS will be with you until the bitter end!y Thing\\" and \\"Limbo.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"The Way The Wind Blows\\" is my favorite track.

1844137864|5.0|In a time when most works of art consist of either inconsequential pseudo-intellectual \\"abstractions\\" or fatuous entertainment, it can be a great relief to stumble upon something like Banksy's paintings/writings on the wall. And here we have a nice compilation by this growingly famous pseudo-anonymous artist for all those who do not plan to bother travelling to London, Barcelona, San Francisco, Palestine or whatever other hellish place that has been blessed with his striking graffiti creations.<br /><br />Incidentally, the Oxford Dictionary defines graffiti as: \\"drawings or writing on a wall, etc. in a public place. They are usually rude, humorous or political.\\" Banksy's work, of course, is all three simultaneously. Perhaps that's one of the elements distinguishing him from other (half)underground artists (or just assertive kids) trying to get their message through by painting public buildings without official permission.<br />For better or for worse, Banksy's art is loaded with meanings - and they're not that difficult to figure out, either. No wonder that no self-respecting \\"modern art\\" museum showed much interest in him - at least until he made himself noticed by blatantly breaking the rules. Don't we all love a non-conformist!<br /><br />In many ways, Banksy represents the good old punk ethos at its best: he is an exemplary practitioner of Do-It-Yourself techniques (up to his famous pranks of sneaking his works into big international museums); his themes are often (if not always) anti-authoritarian; his art is oozing with cynicism and (self-)mockery. Even the leitmotiv of the (nasty, snide, irredeemable) RAT as a reverse mirror of mainstream values, empty promises and not-so-subtle state disciplinary measures is reminiscent of the height of punk insubordination. Those were the days!<br />Still, as we all know, Punk is Dead. Anarchy didn't even come close to becoming more than a cute slogan. The \\"System\\" hasn't collapsed (yet). But that doesn't mean one should stop kicking and screaming, does it?<br /><br />Fortunately, Banksy isn't just a \\"retro\\" artist - quite the opposite, he manages to reflect his own time and culture in a unique and very convincing way. Which is a hell of an achievement, considering how quickly any defiance is turned into a (boring) spectacle these days, with cheap t-shirts and mugs thrown into the bargain.<br />Whether in his mockery of paranoia-inducing surveillance cameras, ever-present police officers, soldiers and impressive arsenal (of the peaceful West) - or his caricatures of a commercial culture incorporating everything from revolutionary anti-capitalist icons to flesh-coloured Christs that glow in the dark, - Banksy twists symbols and turns meanings upside down to shed a light on the contradictions lying beneath a stifling pile of stupefying nonsense and outright lies. Plus he's funny about it. What else could you wish for?<br /><br />Although there are lots of pictures of Banksy's art on the internet, this book offers two advantages: 1) it's much nicer and more comfortable to look at the (many) printed pictures; and 2) the artist has added some interesting personal thoughts/experiences which only contribute to his image of a smart, somewhat riotous but also admirably understated RAT.

B000IOM1Y6|4.0|The Alan Parsons Project hit their greatest commercial pinnacle with \\"Eye In The Sky,\\" the only album other than \\"[[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 I Robot]]\\" to reach the top ten. It was also the moment that the revolving members of APP centralized the two main strengths of their albums: concept and songcraft. \\"Eye In The Sky\\" is so creamily melodic that it's almost easy to miss the underlying concept of intrusive surveillance. Probably more than any other APP CD, this is where the Adult Contemporary sound that eventually dominated Parson's following efforts took hold.<br /><br />That is not to say the songs are lacking. As usual, they are tunefully hooky and usually memory grabbers, like the title track. The opening instrumental \\"Sirius\\" became the introductory theme for thousands of athletic events, and \\"Psychobabble\\" is the obligatory prog-rock song aimed directly at 80's AOR Radio. (Actually, the other song in the vein, \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned,\\" is the weakest song on the CD.) As on previous CD's, the highlights include ballads. On \\"Eye In The Sky,\\" it's \\"Old and Wise\\" with ex-Zombie Colin Blunstone on the lead vocal. One of the discs' more interesting extras is Eric Woolfson's vocal demo on that particular number.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are indicative of just how much work Parsons and Woolfsons put into their music. While \\"Eye In The Sky\\" plays almost like a soundtrack to a movie never produced, the demos show the tinkering that goes on before the final, lush and cinematic sound is crystallized. (Frankly, I like the album enough to have not needed to hear works in progress.) But now that \\"Eye In The Sky\\" and \\"I Robot\\" have been given their sonically upgraded due, it's a joy to hear the kind of mastery Parsons and company put into this soft-rock marvel.<br /><br />I am now hoping for the eventual remastered versions of \\"Pyramid,\\" \\"Eve\\" and \\"Turn Of A Friendly Card.\\"
B000I5X81K|5.0|There is a quality to Groban's voice that is just inspirational. Something about his vibrato mixed with his natural vocal quality is incredible. The fact that he could have gone more classical but found his own genre instead is very impressive. As a voice teacher, opera singer, and creator of [[ASIN:B000297VQA Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath]]and [[ASIN:B000297VQK Voice Lessons To Go Volume 2: Do Re Mi Ear and Pitch Training]], I do not snub his choice to appeal to the popular, rather I think it is fantastic that his voice reaches out to so many and that the pop listener has an opportunity to hear such a developed sound.

076075229X|5.0|Marcus Aurelius's Meditations is a thoughtful set of personal reflections on living and the purpose of life. The cornerstone of his philosophy was Stoicism, which does come across as a bit severe. There are many timeless maxims and thoughts expressed in his notes that are certainly worth remembering and even trying to apply to one's own life today. Some of the well-known quotes and themes expressed include being content with what you have, leading a virtuous life by demonstrating such traits as justice, piety, modesty and so forth, and living each day as if it were your last.     Aurelius believed in the gods and certainly states throughout this book his conception of the natural order of things as they established. We are seen as only insignificant parts of the whole; whether we live a long live or die young, it doesn't really matter. Death should be accepted as part of that plan. All things that happen are for a reason. His is certainly a carpe diem type mentality, though indulging in pleasure doesn't really figure in. Happiness, to Aurelius, is finding yourself and being content with where you are and understanding your role and leading a virtuous life. Don't let your actions be governed by winning the approval of others. Seek tranquility deep within yourself. Avoid passions. These are just some of the many statements and views incorporated into the philosophy espoused by this Roman Emperor. Though he was no supporter of Christianity, from what I understand, you can't help but see a few similarities between some areas of Christian thought and Aurelius's philosophy, at lease on a few points.    Unlike another book by Barnes and Noble I recently read, also part of their library of essential reading, this book has an introduction (which the other one had, but given the length of the other book, more information would have been useful) and helpful concluding sections on the historical Marcus Aurelius and his philosophy. This book is difficult at times, but more oftenthan not, you will grasp the essence of the ideas being conveyed. Timeless.
0823016714|5.0|My first though on seeing this book was: \\"What can it give me that looking through magazines or searching on the internet does not?\\" <br /> <br />A lot, as it turns out.  I was seriously underestimating the value of having so many pictures of faces in one place.  Especially photos showing various angles and extremes of expression -- which can be difficult find in traditional photos.  About thirty seconds with this book was enough to make me realize that I will always keep it within easy reach of my art desk. <br /> <br />In addition to being a great learning tool, I think this book will be especially useful to cartoonists and comic artists.  The extremes of expression make it easy to extrapolate the kind of exaggerated features required for such venues.  Included in the book are example cartoons and caricatures based on the photos.  Some of these even show the extrapolation to expressive animal faces! <br /> <br />No regrets about buying this one.  Now I want one for hands and feet too! <br />

B000MXPE7O|4.0|Ingeniously written, with superlative acting and a masterful score, this sinister drama delves into the mysterious and ruinous influences the CIA has on the lives of their dedicated operatives. A slightly disconcerting timeline doesn't deter from enjoying the crafty elements of betrayal, suspicion and sacrifice that permeate this Cold War espionage epic.<br /><br />Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a well-rounded Yale graduate who is quickly recruited into the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency due to his desired qualities of discretion and commitment. Suspicion and paranoia gradually overrun his once steadfast belief in American values, as he rapidly becomes a chief operative and an integral part of the system. Engulfed in distrust and intent on combating his KGB rival, Wilson consequently sacrifices his ideals and his family in the pursuit of his career.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd achieves what films of this length usually attempt and rarely succeed at, and that is to delve into the inner-workings of its characters and explore character development to its most complex and absolute fullest. Meaningful events and poignant dialogue work beautifully to immerse the viewer into the traumatic lives of those involved in the secretive CIA and its shaky roots. Most prominently is the character study of the fictitious Edward Wilson, whose dynamic rise and fall parallels films such as The Godfather. Although they both fail in preventing what seems to be inevitable destiny, Wilson manages to wash away guilt, feeling and perhaps even acknowledgement of his situation and the sacrifices made to preserve the job that keeps him in an ominous stranglehold. Inhumanly he acts according to its will, half conscious of the consequences to his family and himself, and yet he relishes in the accomplishments that lead to absolute solitude. So many of his ill deeds are attempts at righting other wrongs, and he is perpetually fixed in compromises, sacrifices and decisions that aid the agency. His choices are those of ill-fate and necessity; he is capable of love, but unable to display it fruitfully, and like his father, negatively impacts the lives of his wife and son. A truly tragic character, the viewer is made aware of his hopeless cycle throughout the film, but only at the conclusion do we see the shell of the man chewed up and spit out and left in reflection; he fails to accept the realizations of how his choices affect those closest to him, even though such repercussions are unintentional. The intense themes of paranoia, suspicion, and betrayal are wonderfully conjured up through masterfully dramatic performances by rising star Matt Damon, and equally stunning supporting actors Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert De Niro. John Turturro plays operative Ray Brocco, another outstanding supporting performance, who menacingly and efficiently carries out his duty; he retains a sense of humor at his inception into the agency, but gradually develops into an efficiently torturous henchman. Robert De Niro, who also directs, makes a short appearance, as does Joe Pesci, who has been curiously out of the spotlight for a very long time, garnering a high billing even though his character appears for only one scene...<br /><br />Read the full review at [...]e agency.

Miraculously after the movie is over one cannot stop thinking about the unexpected twists and turns the characters endured. Remaining as true to the book as it can in two hours and nine minutes the movie stayed accurate to Jane Austen's descriptions. The movie follows the book.  Elizabeth Bennet, the main character in the movie, is flawlessly played by Keira Knightley, who also played in the Pirates of the Caribbean, and Matthew Macfadyen plays the prideful, misunderstood Mr. Darcy. Since the movies title is \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" Elizabeth Bennet has prejudice and Mr. Darcy is seen as prideful, because of his reserved, publicly shy nature. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" portrays the perfect love story and envelopes and inspires the viewer with a passion for unsoiled romance.  <br /> <br />Elizabeth Bennet has four sisters all of whom were unmarried. This presented a problem according to their mother whose goal was to marry off all of them to rich respectable gentlemen, when the opportunity presented itself. Luckily two rich men named Charles Bingley and Mr. Darcy were attending a ball which was open to the public. All five Bennet girls attended. By the end of the evening two things about the gentlemen were clear to Elizabeth, one Mr. Bingley undoubtedly fancied her older sister Jane, and two, Mr. Darcy was conceited. Decidedly, hastily, and openly Elizabeth \\"swore to loathe him for all eternity.\\" Although Jane was shy Elizabeth could see that she liked Mr. Bingley. Talking periodically over the next months Jane and Bingley knew each other quite well until Jane received a letter basically stating that Bingley was returning to London. Elizabeth suspected that the despicable Darcy had convinced Bingley to leave because Darcy did not approve of Jane's relatives. After her family's farewells, Jane was sent of to London to stay with relations in hope that Bingley would learn of her presence and visit her.  <br /> <br />With her sister gone Elizabeth was bored and sad and confused fortunately she was invited to visit a friend. She welcomed the change of scenery and left. This friend lived near a rich pompous Lady who had her nephew, the Mr. Darcy, visiting her. In church all Elizabeth could do was stare at him in disgust then after the sermon she ran outside to be alone in the rain with her tears and thoughts. He had followed her. He proposed to her. She sharply rejected him. He then left her. Elizabeth's mind was spinning, the man she hated had proposed to her! Imagine that! Completely distressed Elizabeth went back to her friend's house to clean up. While staring at her reflection in the mirror, Mr. Darcy entered the house and placed a letter on the windowsill because he could not verbally explain his intentions toward Bingley and her sister. Reading the letter when he had left Elizabeth's view of Darcy had changed. Elizabeth returned home, still bewildered, and found that her aunt and uncle had delivered her sister from London. <br /> <br />Although Elizabeth had just returned home, her heart wanted to get away from her family so she gladly accepted an invitation to go with her aunt and uncle to tour the sights of the Peak District. Despite her swirling mind Elizabeth enjoyed the trip, until she learned that they were going to tour Mr. Darcy's home. That set her off. Instantly she tried to sway her aunt and uncle not to see his house, but to no avail. Mr. Darcy's housekeeper talked of her master as a wonderful man, a man Elizabeth prejudged as proud when he was really kind and considerate. She had been wrong about him. After arriving home again, talking with Jane, and resting in the parlor with her mother and sisters, Elizabeth was surprised when Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy knocked on the door. The two gentlemen entered the parlor said a few words then Bingley left suddenly again with Darcy trailing behind because Bingley, who was nervous, did not know how to express his feelings. Reentering the room, moments later, he asked to talk to Jane in private. Elizabeth knew all to well that Bingley was proposing to her sister, and guessed that Darcy had helped him do so. All had ended well for Jane, but does it end well for Elizabeth? You will have to watch the heart wrenching ending to find out. <br /> <br />Drawing you in like a hungry bear to food, \\"Pride and Prejudice's\\" actors and setting made the viewer feel like they were in the story. Keira Knightley did an exceptional job of playing Elizabeth because she showed the character's obvious outward emotions and internally complex emotions as well. She forced the viewer to experience, endure, and relish in happiness, disgust, and pain. Once you feel the emotions Elizabeth underwent it is easier to understand Mr. Darcy's emotions which are intricate and misunderstood. He is a complicated man. Exceptionally well written \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate love story. If you want a romantic and heart pumping movie, which touches your very soul, watch \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" <br />
0451526368|5.0|I absolutely love this story. It was written to be read more than once, as the humor is sometimes lost the first time around. My favorite thing about the novel is the \\"normal\\" heroine Catherine.  I found it really easy to relate with how she was feeling throughout the entire book and could just picture her talking to me.    <br /> <br />John Thorpe reminded me of high school and his character added to the adolescent/innocence of the overall book. <br /> <br />My favorite part of the book is Catherine's trip to, and arrival of, Northanger Abbey. Henry's tale was very graphic and Catherine's sleepless night and awakening morning made me laugh. <br /> <br />Any Jane Austen fan would love this book and those that found Pride and Prejudice too difficult/boring/etc., this book might make them a fan.
0811826848|5.0|As a hard core Beatles fan I can recommend many books,but if I had to recommend only one it would probably be this one. This is a complete,definitive biography,told in their own words. Not surprising that they should feel the need to do this. With all the tabloid fiction out there, I'm surprised they didn't do this earlier. I'm also not surprised that some people are calling it incomplete, saying that this seems to be their version of the story that they want put out. Could it be because this IS the actual true story about them? No really! Do they mean to imply that they ( the Beatles) actually know more about this subject (the Beatles) then some idiot who met them twice, or (maybe not at all) and decided to make some money by writing a second rate book? The audacity! This book tells the story from birth to break up. There is no filler, just facts. And it is told in their own funny,matter of fact,no nonsense way.  <br />  <br />  Of course the music is the spotlight. Each album is gone over with a fine tooth comb and you are lifted right into the atmosphere, and events unfolding behind the scenes that made each album special. Actually everything they talk about,from their childhoods to Beatlemania seems to lift you right into the scene.  This is helped by the gorgeous pictures, almost all of them from their personal collections. Even if you are illiterate you will want this book just for the pictures. By the way, John's quarter of the story is told through interviews. Thank goodness he gave so many. Some of the pictures even have his written comments scrawled on them,showing us exactly how he felt at the time. There are hundreds of pictures of documents, handwritten play lists, handwritten lyrics, notes, hotel and restaurant bills,lists of concerts (again with John's handwritten comments about what was going on.) These guys kept everything! I can't beleive that Paul and Ringo actually kept plane and hotel receipts from a long ago trip to Greece with Jane Asher and Maureen Cox.(at that time,the future Mrs. Starkey) There is even a document at the top corner of one of the pages, (I bet a lot of people missed it) which refers to the request for some lice removal medicine to be delivered to one unfortunate Beatle's home. Of course they are NOT  talking about head lice,and having read Peter Brown's pointless,vindictive book,The Love You Make,I know that this may have been Paul's way of saying,'Yes it's true but Epstein's creepy,lackey had no right to put it in a book (and make lots of money). Or maybe I read it in  that other rag, Yesterday by Chet Flippo. I had the misfortune of reading both books. Don't make the same mistake.  <br /> <br />    Don't get me wrong, I don't mind reading juicy,personal stuff as long as it's true and not embellishment. And there are plenty of interesting,sexy, stories,and stories of John's craziness but coming from their mouths, I know they are true. Except for that peeing on nuns story. Really John! George says it never happened and I beleive him. This book is like a huge memoir. A personal scrapbook and photo album. You will enjoy it's beauty,candidness, and it's entertaining style. And it's not true that most of these stories have been told before. I've read hundreds of books on the Fabs and 90% of this book is fresh, especially the early years. While you're at it, get the Anthology DVD set also. It's completely different from this book! Talk about quality, and value for money! Something that's always been important to the Beatles.    <br />      <br /> <br />
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Yah, yah,  I'm huge RUSH fan- all their cd's- got suckered into the $100 tickets to the last few tours, etc., etc.   Let's face it- a lot of the fans love their new cd's which is fair and fine and a bunch just find the last few cd's \\"phone-in's\\".  I'm not going to compare this to their moving pics periods, hemispheres, etc. (not fair) cause the band does evolve.  But to what now?  Just old rockers making cd's for their loyal fans.  I like this a little better than Vapor Trails if that means anything.  There's a few actually good tunes on here (the instrumentals- the monkey song is great) but it is already collecting dust on my cd shelf along Vapor Trails.  There's Sooooo much more fun/better/relevant music out these days (and I'm not just talking rockers) that I buy a new Rush cd, listen to it for a week or so and then move on.... forever.  Thank god for their back catalog!
1862303495|3.0|The subtitle of this book is `A Fable', and so I suppose we are not meant to look for too much realism in this Holocaust story.  Possibly (so one review suggests) written for children,  its subject matter is grim enough;  but  its tone, especially at the beginning, put me off: it is faux-naive and painfully arch;  and there are too many unbelievable aspects of it.  The central character is nine-year old Bruno.  The first false note is struck when Bruno learns that `the Fury' has big things in mind for his father, who is a high-ranking member of the SS and is in fact being posted, with his family, from Berlin to become the Commandant at Auschwitz.  Of course it is ludicrous that a nine-year old in Nazi Germany would have misheard - not just once but persistently - `the Fury' for the F&uuml;hrer or `Out-With' for Auschwitz (the puns don't work in German anyway).  In 1943 a little German boy, especially one whose father was in the SS, would have been in the Pimpfen, the section of the Hitler Youth for six to ten year olds, where he would already have learnt to worship the F&uuml;hrer;  he would have learnt the notion of the Fatherland, which in this novel seems to puzzle him;  he would most likely have followed the campaigns of the German army on maps and would have known (as he doesn't)  where Poland was;  and he would already have become familiar, at least in the abstract, with the concept of Untermenschen - instead of which he doesn't even know what a Jew is, and, when his sister mentions the word, he asks her whether he and she were Jews!  He had lived in the Commandant's house at Auschwitz for a whole year - and we are to believe that he had never heard the word!<br /><br />Some parts of the book are  a little more credible.  A child would probably not have known what it was dangerous to say (though I have to say that, as a nine-year old myself in Nazi Germany, I did have a pretty good sense of that.)  Many Germans, and especially children, would not have known of the horrors of the concentration camps and would have been as uncomprehending as Bruno was of what they saw:  the ghost-like creatures on the other side of the barbed wire fence which separated the camp from the neat garden of the Commandant's house.<br /><br />Bruno hates his new home.  For one thing, there are no other children for him to play with.  And then one day Bruno disobeys orders and goes `exploring' along the fence and at the far end and on the other side of it he meets Shmuel - the boy (of exactly the same age as Bruno) in the striped pyjamas - who is sitting there all on his own, and they meet in that spot and talk regularly thereafter for a year.  Shmuel understands the difference between their situations well enough,  but Bruno is impossibly naive and obtuse in picking up the meaning of what his new friend is telling him, though something tells him that he should not tell his family of these meetings.  He remains innocent until the end.<br /><br />Of course the heart of the author is in the right place; and he does convey the horror of the camps; but I could not suspend my disbelief  in Bruno - and without that ability, the book did not work for me either as a fable or as a credible story, and so I have some reservation about this flawed way of dealing with the Holocaust.horrors of the concentration camps and would have been as uncomprehending as Bruno was of what they saw:  the ghost-like creatures on the other side of the barbed wire fence which separated the camp from the neat garden of the Commandant's house. <br /> <br />Bruno hates his new home.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the brother copy of the Discovery Planet Earth which is currently televised.  The only difference is the narrator, in this case the celebrated actor Richard Attenborough. <br />The content is captivating and quite educaional.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I think this one will only get popular over time, as word of mouth and eventual DVD and cable distribution give viewers a chance to appreciate the strengths of this movie and the tale of Leonidas, who led 300 Spartans into battle. Unlike similar films, including that botched film about Troy with Brad Pitt, this one will resonate with viewers.<br /><br /> One warning - it has extremely graphic and bloody scenes, so if you take family members, consider their ability to handle this. Beheadings, dismemberments, deformities and cruelty - it is all here, but it is counterbalanced by other elements.<br /><br />  Here's my summary of this movie's strong points (in no special order):<br /><br />1. From beginning to end, there is plenty of action, much of it very graphic violence. But it isn't action without CONTEXT. It isn't just done for shock value. There is some real historical information but it is merged with the action and doesn't weigh down the film. In short, there aren't long, boring scenes. This one moves quickly!<br /><br />2. There is an exploration of the Spartan philosophy, including how young boys are trained for battle. It is graphic but believable.<br /><br />3. The characterizations are believable, particularly Leonida. There is an emphasis on action and emotion is used sparingly (except in battle), but what comes through is believable and all the stronger for it. You can feel the passion between Leonidas and his wife, even as he maintains his strict emotional control with his men.<br /><br />  I couldn't take my eyes off Gerald Butler as Leonidas, who combined steadfast determination, the desire to change from the old ways to the new and absolute believability as the leader of the Spartans.<br /><br />4, The graphics and the dark, heavy atmosphere. The director uses the red of the Spartan uniforms to make certan figures stand out and there is a lot of black and white in some scenes. It is very effective.<br /><br />5. A certain surrealism or mythic quality that transcends the script or any historical or other flaws that may be in the film (my husband, the historian, couldn't help pointing those out).<br /><br />  I don't know how Miller's fans (this movie is based on a book by Frank Miller) will feel about this film and I'm not familiar with the graphic novel. But, for sheer entertainment value with a bit of history thrown in, this one can't be beat. I haven't heard a single negative comment from anyone who has seen it.rrealism or mythic quality that transcends the script or any historical or other flaws that may be in the film (my husband, the historian, couldn't help pointing those out).  <br /> <br />    I don't know how Miller's fans (this movie is based on a book by Frank Miller) will feel about this film and I'm not familiar with the graphic novel.

B0006ZE7G2|3.0|I remember first time I watched this film in movie theatre when it was released to the first theatrical events, I left the room really disappointed. I felt that Floyd had lost one great opportunity of creating a masterpiece of images and music. By that time we all were still under the impact of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" album a real masterpiece and there was a great expectation about the film, but I have to confess, I had an insight that it wasn't to happen and why I affirm this, because one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my life was my decision of watching the worst film of all times, a film called \\"Fame\\" or \\"Infamous if you like\\", and guess who was the director of this ridiculous film, yes Alan Parker, so I couldn't expect nothing better from this guy really. Can you all remember good films this guy has been done? Well, no, so do I! It was really a disaster this choice, but how we cannot change what happened, I only can give three stars for the few really good moments this film has, like that of \\"Goodbye blue sky\\" and I'm sure this great moments is much more because of the music than the image itself, no, one thing we have to say and recognize \\"the work of Gerald Scarfe is a real work of genius\\" he was with Pink Floyd since the creation of the fantastic \\"The Wall\\" artwork. Can you all imagine if this film had been done by Ridley Scott with the help of Gerald Scarfe, wow, simply no comments... It would have been a truly masterpiece!
B00005JPD0|2.0|Deja Vu is about a man who is on this mission to get facts about a bombing that takes place in some remote dock out. There is time travel involved in the film. There is a lot of detective work and dragging storylines around this film. There is little or nothing \\"cool\\" about this film. I almost slept shortly before the intermission. I know there are a gazillion Denzel Washington fans and all; I can respect that but seriously, guys, WHAT A BAD FILM. This film reminded me of XXX 2. And readers, Van Helsing was a better film than Deja Vu and that is saying a lot without saying much.
B0001I55OC|1.0|Normally I wouldn't bother with a negative review but, I really liked the book, and thought that this will be such a cool movie. Wrroonngg!<br /><br />The science in the book was deemed to hard to understand for a movie audience and so this dumbed down story resulted. I can't even say you can relax your mind and enjoy this. Just skip it and enjoy the very good book.
0596007124|4.0|The book contains excellent explanations about the topic.  The presentation and detail is well thought.   <br /> <br />My only complaint is that the book is so LONG.  Not good if you are not a slow learner.

The deadpan deliveries are so \\"spot on\\" that I think if you have any appreciation for dry humor, you will enjoy this. The gore is comic not realistic , but very abundant. So for (in the words of Monte Python) \\"Something completely different\\", try out \\"Shaun of the Dead\\"

0140432051|5.0|There are many different versions of Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\" available, but I found this one particularly helpful.  First, while it is nicely printed and easy to read on good paper, it is not terribly expensive.  Second, it reprints the first or original version of the book which Darwin subsequently modified substantially in the the further five editions he published.  Third, it also includes Darwin's \\"Historical Sketch\\" and \\"glossary\\" which had not appeared in the first edition. Fourth, the color cover illustration by the Victorian artist Henry de la Beche is an important indicator of why the Victorians were so into prehistoric studies. However, the thing that really distinguishes this Penguin Books edition is the incredibily incisive and invaluable introduction by the editor, J.W. Burrow.  Burrow is beyond question one of the most significant intellectual historians of our time.  Among other things he has written extensively on the concept of evolution in Victorian thought in his classic \\"Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory.\\"  In 37 crisp pages, Burrow incomparably sketches the Victorian intellectual background against which Darwin wrote.  Although the essay is nearly 40 years old, it has stood the test of time very well.  It alone is worth the price of the book. Altogether, a very nice introduction to this critical event in scientific and intellectual history.
B000065BPB|5.0|After doing the usual review on the web for a pair of headphones I decided on the 280 model.  The headphones are very well built but the real proof is in the sound.  I tried them out and they sounded good. I am an electrical engineer and I have designed audio based products for 20 years so I really wanted to see what this product could do.  I used my function generator to inject a signal and varied the frequency from 10hz to 20khz.  I listed to each side and then both together.  The lows were great, very flat response all the way down to its lower spec. I thought the highs rolled off a little early so I had my kids listen.  Well I guess my age is catching up with me since I could not hear much above 13khz while both of my kids could hear it up to 18khz.    I then listened to a variety of music and the headphones reproduced the sounds very good, very tight with the base.  The bottom line is this product performs quite well.  If they were to break, I would buy another set. <br /> <br />Bob
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Shane Black, 2005)<br /><br />I sometimes forget that under Robert Downey, Jr.'s deeply troubled exterior lies a world-class actor. Then I see one of his good movies, and the late eighties come flooding back. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, despite its awkward title (and how strange is it that this is the sixth movie to carry that title?), is definitely one of those.<br /><br />Downey plays Harry Lockhart, a small-time crook who stumbles into the beginnings of an acting career while fleeing from some nasty men with guns. Lockhart is transplanted to the other side of the country and under consideration for the lead in a detective series; in order to get him some ideas about what happens on the job, he gets paired up with real private detective Perry (Val Kilmer). Meanwhile, he's run into Harmony (Unfaithful's Michelle Monaghan), the girl he had a major crush on in high school who went out to Hollywood to become an actress. Perry is planning on keeping Harry out of danger, but the two of them quickly become embroiled in an ugly, complex case.<br /><br />I don't watch too many comedies; not because I don't like them, but because I prefer other genres of film. So I don't laugh terribly much when watching movies. This month, though, I've laughed more at movies than I have in the past year. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was half the reason. (He Died with a Felafel in His Hand was the other half.) Kilmer and Downey are great foils for one another, and both have very good timing here. Add in a few overly weird minor characters and the mother of all Rube Goldbergian plots, and you've got yourself a winner. No one will mistake this for deathless cinema, but then again, it never aspires to be. *** ½
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I got to tell you all, this one caught me by surprise! I am a HUGE rush fan who owns all of their commercial releases. I have only read thru a few pages but i am stunned that any Rush fan could give this release one star. Of course this is all opinion, but come on - this is EASILY their best release in a decade, and apart from Counterparts (a mid 90's classic), one could argue this is their best effort since Signals! No weak songs and a number of real gems. Echoes of early Budgie (if you haven't heard of this influential Welsh power trio you best get with it!) on several numbers (esp. Any Way the Wind Blows) is simply wonderous! I have waited a LONG time to hear more acoustic guitar on a Rush record and this one delivers. Now if they will just do an acoustic medley that includes Twilight Zone and Tears onstage!.....These old goats still rock...if you are a Rush fan, I'd HIGHLY recommend you pick up this cd today!    <br />
B000NA28IE|2.0|Eragon (Stefan Fangmeier, 2006)<br /><br />Fangmeier, the visual effects supervisor for a number of high-profile effects-heavy movies (among his resume are Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, and Twister, among many others), takes to the director's chair for his big screen debut. And my oh my, is it an ambitious one-- Christopher Paolini's epic novel Eragon, here adapted by Peter Buchman. Don't know the name? Well, this was only his second project. The first was Jurassic Park III.<br /><br />Are alarm bells going off in your head yet? They should be.<br /><br />If there's one thing Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien taught us, it's that if you put a lot of effects in a movie and back it up with some solid characters, audiences will, in fact, sit through three hours of movie. (Most other countries in the world recognize this. It's only America where we have this odd attention span problem with movies over two hours.) And Eragon demands a three-hour treatment; I mean, come on, this is a book of almost six hundred pages, and it's dense. Paolini packed a great deal of action into those pages, but there was more than enough room for character development, uneasy alliances, witty repartee, and all the other things that made the book such a fun read. Buchman, in short, butchered it. Major characters disappear entirely, and others exist only, it seems, to pacify readers of the novel. (Murtagh is the biggest major character given short shrift, getting only eight lines; the big plot twist regarding him is relegated to a useless piece of trivia in the film.) He did keep a good portion of the action, but that's about it.<br /><br />Worse is (some of) the acting. There are a number of big names in here, and they give varying levels of expertise in their performances. Jeremy Irons, by far, is the brightest light among them. As Brom, Eragon's mentor, Irons conveys the character's mix of amusement, despair, and gratitude quite well (in fact, Irons makes Brom a much more likable and three-dimensional chap than he was in the book). John Malkovich comes perilously close to overacting to unintentional hilarity as King Galbatorix; his only saving grace is that he doesn't get enough screen time to really mess things up. Joss Stone is as flatly uninteresting an actress as she is a singer. Robert Carlyle I didn't even recognize, he's so cardboard here. Djimon Hounsou looks as if he's about ready to burst into laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. Edward Speelers, the unknown cast in the title role, comes relatively close to getting it right, but there's no sense of him going from naïve farm boy to accomplished warrior-mage. (I am, however, willing to place the blame for that entirely on the butchered script.) The others? Don't bother. Speelers, Irons, and Rachel Weisz (as the voice of Sephira the dragon) are the only characters here who get more than twenty or thirty lines in the entire film.<br /><br />The one thing Eragon does have in its favor is the visual effects. Given Fangmeier's usual job description, that's not surprising. A lot of the effects seem rather unrooted in the storyline, but there you go. And while Sephira's development is mostly sacrificed in the interests of saving time, what we see of her is wonderful, especially the scenes of her as an infant.<br /><br />Despite the above, I have to say, I seem to have liked the movie a lot more than most people did. It is not the book by any means, and it is clumsily-handled in the extreme, but I think it does manage to do what it sets out to-- be a mindless action flick with a whole lot of special effects. For a turn-your-brain-off good time, it's not awful if you've never read the book. ** ½likable and three-dimensional chap than he was in the book).

B00005JLCI|5.0|I was too impatient for the DVD and found a boxed set of the Laserdisc on e-bay and bought it (only to find out only a few months later I could pre-order a DVD version on Amazon.com). <br /> <br />I was one of the lucky ones who saw this film in 70mm in the theater and I loved it! Bit roles from legends Charleton Heston and John Gielgud are worth the price of the DVD alone!  <br /> <br />
0802130208|5.0|One of the greatest pleasures I have ever had in literature.  I re-read the book almost immeadiately.  Talk about a genius who died young?   I want this guy back!!   Please read if you have not, I promise you will not be sorry, it is a work of true inspired genius. <br /> <br />PS - makes me want to eat a Lucky Dog just thinking about the book!!
0790736918|5.0|I've almost never seen a John Wayne movie, but I had heard about <br />this film for a while from Marion from Madison County, Iowa. <br />Excellently paced with interlacing story lines.  A rugged yet <br />compassionate movie.  Some comedic interludes thru a dusty <br />and gritty tale of conviction and honor. An all-time great.
0452286751|4.0|Rand's ideology dominates all of her work, and this is her masterwork.  No one will ever accuse her of being Steinbeck, Hemingway or Hawthorne as far as her writing style, yet her charecters and storyline are among the best developed in modern literature.   <br /> <br />Her abject fear and loathing of Socialism/Communism is so palpable, that it gives you a real read and feel of the times in which she lived. <br /> <br />I just wish she was a little less long winded.

1400032717|4.0|It is not often that you read something that is actually original, and interesting.  This was definitiely both.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale proves that there is still a lot of life in this series and shows no signs of slowing down any time soon, which is great news for long time fans such as myself. There couldn't have been a better choice to play Bond than Daniel Craig, he brings a realness to the character of Bond, the likes of which hasn't really been seen since the Dalton films. Not saying that the Brosnan films are bad, no way, but it's back to basic Bond in this movie and it is like a fresh breath of air. This movie, being the first story in the series, gets rid of all of the gadgets that movies have relied on for so many films and goes back to emotion and excellent action sequences. It seemed that the Bond movies always tried to out-do the others by having fancier weapons from Q branch, so it is good to see something different.<br /><br />The story itself is full of emotion, comedy and action. Overall, this is exactly what I want out of my James Bond movies. I have seen this movie four times, twice in one day once, and it still isn't old. It is a movie that you learn more about the more you watch it. Everyone just fit, and what better way than to have the same guy who directed Goldeneye direct this?! This being based on the writings of Ian Flemming doesn't hurt either. This is a great movie that you have to see, I can't wait to see the next film!
1592289444|5.0|Rawicz grips the reader in each of his book's three stages: 1) his time in Soviet prison, 2) his time in a Soviet slave labor camp, and 3) his time walking from Siberia to India.<br /><br />Remarkably, in any one of these stages, the reader is apt to wonder how anyone could have lived through it.  But Rawicz lived through all three and does a wonderful job telling about them.<br /><br />Despite the book's fairly short length, it boasts great fullness.  Rawicz slowly introduces his co-fugitives and he sucessfully conveys the emotions he felt along each portion of his journey.<br /><br />These men's walk was out of necessity; however, to the reader, their journey is an adventure, as they move through strange lands, the terrain and climate of which were brutal but not nearly as brutal as their Soviet captors in hot pursuit.<br /><br />Great book.  Highly recommend.
1582701709|4.0|Easy to read.  A lot of very good messages that we have heard before, but really need to hear again and again.  The repitition of the message is good, because one needs to hear it again and again to really begin to believe it.  I am starting to try to live according to the principles in the book, and I hope it will make a difference in my life.
B00005JPFF|2.0|If you want to just enjoy wild comicbook-like action, you may love this movie.  Personally, if the action scenes are too unbelievable, the producers have lost me! <br /> <br />Also, the pace of this movie goes from veeeeeeery slow, to WHAM!  Son-of-Goblin wisks Peter off his unsuspecting feet and we launch into miles of thrashing each other into brick walls, up and down hundreds of feet in a split-second.  Where they lost me (early) was why were they each fine after certain building-bashing-blows, but then \\"hurt\\" by less severe thrashings?   <br /> <br />Ok, I liked that they introduced and blended a subplot of an escaped murderer (who we are supposed to feel sorry for because he's only trying to steal money to help his ill daughter).  But how tha-duh is he running across a huge grassy field in frickin' downtown NYC, and stumbles into some new technology testing pit, in which he is turned into sand?  Um... do we get a follow-up on why this top-secret experiment location is in downtown NYC?  Come on! <br /> <br />And there is ZERO follow-up at how there happened to be a living thing from outer space landing on Earth.  No one ever even questions the issues raised by that.  Come on!! <br /> <br />And I guess NYC is just a really small place, because Peter's recently-fired rival photographer is wandering the streets and just happens to hear Peter grunting hundreds of feet up in a downtown NYC bell tower.  What a cheesy way to get the bad black junk onto our next angry man.  The script writers may have recently seen the ending of The Exorcist and thought it was a cool way to effect this transition.  Better to get original, and THINK!  Come on!!!  <br /> <br />The way every street-walkin' NYC babe (of course they are the only kind of women in the city) went gaga over Peter's simple hip movement, was not exactly convincing.  Come on!!!! <br /> <br />And I'll end my complaints with the final scene.  How is it credible that after hours of falling glass, devastation by the giant sandman, and falling vehicles, we still have a huge crowd of Spider-man cheerers standing right in the middle of it all??????  Did the director recall 9-11-01, when real falling debree made real people really flee with every ounce of energy they had, and as far as they could as fast as they could? <br />Come Come on!!!!! <br /> <br />Sorry, Spider fans.  This box-office exciter is too stupid for anyone with more than sand for a brain.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|I've listened to the CD a few times and like it - IF I don't listen too closely. \\"Everything\\" is great and is getting some radio airplay - nice for MB! This guy KNOWS how to swing! BUT the lisp/slurring on \\"I've Got The World On A String\\" is completely weird and really interferes with enjoying the song. The same problem is present on other tracks but not as prevalent. <br /> <br />   This is completely baffling! How did they let these tracks out of the studio like this? Were the producers asleep in the headsets? If he has a speech impediment, I haven't noticed it before AND it isn't consistent throughout the album. Punch in, guys. (Now his slurry, sub-par American Idol performance makes more sense......) <br /> <br />   I really like MB - \\"Home\\" is one of my favorite songs - but this album isn't as good as It's Time and now, with \\"World on a THTWING\\" (ETC.), I can't listen with much pleasure. Sorry, Michael.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|This title is not going to be a blockbuster like Spider-Man and Fantastic Four but it was never intended to be. <br /> <br />You'll read good reviews from comic book fans and bad reviews from everyone else. Oh, some bad reviews from REAL hardcore comic book fans will appear too because the movie isn't EXACTLY like the comic. Well, neither were the two movies considered the greatest comic book adaptations of all time, Spider-Man 2 and X-Men 2. Those also strayed from the comics a bit (Spider built his web-shooters in the comics, they didn't just appear under his skin!). <br /> <br />Movies cannot always adaopt exact renditions of their original books. <br /> <br />But the movie also has a few plot holes. That is true. You can bicker about those or just do what Ghost Rider does... sit back and enjoy the ride! For Marvel fans, this has been a wonderful decade overall for comic book movies. They won't all be the greatest! (i.e., Ang Lee's Hulk movie which was a pure insult, far worse than EITHER Punisher movie in its lack of respect for fans as well as newcomers to the character.) But most will be a lot of fun. <br /> <br />Nicholas Cage is not the actor's real name. Being a Marvel fan as a kid, he adopted his screen name from Luke Cage-Hero for Hire. So it's GREAT that Cage finally landed a Marvel movie role and he does put his all into this one. <br /> <br />The plot? Good, certainly not great, but don't nit-pick and you'll enjoy the ride... and for those Ghost Rider fans who go WAY back to the 1950s' western version of the title... you are in for a treat too!
1591841666|4.0|Or so says Seth Godin in his latest.  If you are wasting away in whatever you are pursuing, stop digging a dry hole and get out. He gives sound advice with 3 questions to ask before quitting(a key one is to know the difference between one potential customer blowing you off vs. the market doing it); demonstrates why coming to the end of your rope is often a blessing(he who has little to lose often has the greatest freedom); and rightly assails the dumb stories we are told as children(and keep telling ourselves) that we must be well rounded(code for being average in a lot of things) and that winners never quit and quiters never win(it hurts to even type that; it should be rephrased as never quit anything with long term potential just because of the stress of the moment, but only get into something in the first place where you have potential). There are others ideas on the value of focus vs. the perils of diversification and the emergence of micromarkets. All in all, reading this slim volume is like having a good talk with a friend over drinks.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that when I heard that pretty boy from My So-Called Life put a band together, put on some eyeliner, and recorded a couple of albums I wrote it off as a Dogstar-ish (Keanu Reeves) effort.  It didn't help their cause that Jared Leto is just a very pretty man.  There...I said it.  Jealousy?  Maybe but it'd be like Angelina Jolie becoming a jazz singer.  Again, I was wrong.  I was completely wrong.  These guys kick some serious butt.  The music is tight, fast, and hard.  The lyrics are fluid, catchy, and just deep enough to rise about the mainstream.  If you want to hear some good musicians just tear it up.  This is a solid buy.  Their really isn't a weak song.  It's a tight album.
0786838655|5.0|I am reading this book aloud to a group of gifted 4th and 5th graders and they love it.  We have just completed a mythology unit and this compliments their academic achievements wonderfully.  I strongly recommend this book, particularly on a summer book list for students with some background in mythology.
B00005R5G9|5.0|This movie I grew up watching I love it. Product was as promised. If only things like this could happen in real life.  :)
B00005T30L|5.0|The phone rings.  Enid says, \\"Aren't you going to answer that?\\"<br /><br />Seymour says, \\"I have no desire to talk to anyone who wants to talk to me.\\"<br /><br />He picks it up anyway and listens and then says, \\"That's my mother.\\"<br /><br />I just about cracked up.<br /><br />Well, the whole movie cracked me up.  It's a work of art from indie auteur Terry Zwigoff whom I recall as the director of the edgy documentary Crumb (1994).  For some reason, as I was watching this, I thought it was directed by Todd Solondz who directed the amazingly real and funny Welcome to the Doll House (1995).  I imagined this as a kind of high school/out of high school progression from the junior high school of Welcome to the Doll House.  It could be, actually, with Thora Birch playing an older Dawn Weiner and having all those bad things happen to her, but still managing to survive it all.  Both Enid Coleslaw and Dawn Weiner are amazingly true to life and also amazingly talented and unappreciated outsiders in this arbitrary and capricious world.  Birch (whom I remember vividly from American Beauty 1999) in her glasses and all those campish outfits over her rather ample figure was just outstanding.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson who plays her friend Rebecca was as vivid as my high school date on prom night and actually prettier (I have to admit).  She was also outstanding.  Both Johansson and Birch are charismatic in a way that will glue your eyes to the screen.  They play ultra cynical slackers who love to satirize the world and their fellow creatures as they hide their vulnerability from themselves.  They are so cute.<br /><br />Steve Buscemi plays Seymour, a kind of autobiographical alter ego of cartoonist Daniel Clowes (thus Enid's last name, \\"Coleslaw\\") who wrote the comic from which he and Zwigoff adapted the movie.  Buscemi manages a tricky part calling for old school dorkishness, vulnerability and self-consciousness portrayed in an ultimately winning and sympathetic way.<br /><br />There are a lot of amusing insider \\"trivia\\" comments about this movie at IMDb, including the fact that Sophie Crumb, daughter of Robert Crumb, did the drawings in Enid's notebook.  One of the most amusing is this: \\"The actor who plays the high school principal in the graduation scene also plays one of the customers in the porno shop. This was not intentional--Terry Zwigoff cast him as a porno shop customer forgetting that he also played the principal.\\"<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />See this for Zwigoff who has the eye and the ear of a genius, a man who knows the hearts of his characters and the mass culture they live in, and how to satirize them both, but gently with affection..   <br /> <br />There are a lot of amusing insider \\"trivia\\" comments about this movie at IMDb, including the fact that Sophie Crumb, daughter of Robert Crumb, did the drawings in Enid's notebook.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|I love this show wish it was still on air. I can't find the rest of the seasons found the series but it is a bit pricy. This box set was in excellent condition and was as promised thank you so much.
B0000CD5FN|4.0|I'm determined not to gush over this album!! however I think Joe got close to where he was going with the mescaleros and it all feels criminally unfinished. It's clear that the band had to release everything to fill the whole album but when you listen to 'Get Down Moses' or 'Ramshakle Day Parade' you know it was a major step on from Global a Go Go. Joe's dream was this world music fusion that rocked!! I like to think that he got there but just think there was so much more to come. GUSH GUSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0743455967|5.0|If you have even a passing interest in writing, this book is an absolute must. Stephen King's insights are spot-on and extremely useful. <br /> <br />Even if you are not a writer, you still HAVE to read the first portion of the book, the autobiographical section, because it is wildly entertaining, as well as the section at the end which tells in all-too-vivid detail the horror of the van accident that almost killed him. <br /> <br />And for that matter, avid readers will still enjoy the middle section, On Writing, because it will give them new insight into why they like the books they do, and gives you new ways to think about those that you read. <br /> <br />This is the best nonfiction book I've ever read. Just fantastic. <br />
B000FL7CAK|5.0|...and I'm not necessarily describing Kristen Bell. While Season 1 of Veronica Mars packs more punch, Season 2 is not to be overlooked. The second season shows much more character development and almost as many plot twists.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I have been itching to see this movie for a while. I knew by the previews that this was going to be an enjoyable flick; but I didn't brace myself for how intelligent and perfect a film it would be!.<br /><br />The movie is about Harold Crick (Will Ferrell); a meticulously mathematical man living a simple life as an IRS auditor. He lives a very structured and monotonous life; and the 'voice' who's narrating his life brings you up to speed about Mr. Crick and why he is so special. On day, Mr. Crick started to hear it. The Voice! He starts to hear his life being narrated in detail by an female voice who also alerts him to the fact, that his impending death is near. (Ofcourse, no one else can hear the voice- which obviously leads to the movie funnier side!)<br /><br />From that moment onwards; his perfect little structured life gets turned upside down as he tries to find out why his life is being narrated and how to stop his death. We get introduced to a number of other characters that will become more meaningful as the movie progresses including an artistic and independent pastry-chef ( Maggie Gyllenhaal); an intelligent/yet/quirky literature professor ( Dustin Hoffman); The Voice ( and Narrator of Harold Crick's story, Emma Thompson) and The Publisher's No-Nonsense aide (who is sent to make sure all writers meet their designated deadlines for books; Queen Latifah).<br /><br />This movie is really deep. THere are many levels of consciousness here and one can easily analyze life and the 'meaning of it all' with this amazingly well-done flick. If you knew the plan for your life and the coming of your death; what would you do and how would you stop The Narrator from putting that final period at your demise.<br /><br />THis is a must. (It kinda reminds me of 'The Truman Show', but with a lot drama and an a darker-yet-more-liberating plot and vision). For every one who likes a movie that makes them think, dream, fantasize and visualize life as a whole narrated world..this is the movie to own..is the movie to own..
B000NVIXDW|4.0|First and foremost, I've been a loyal Michael Buble fan since 2003, when his debut album blew me away. <br /> <br />His follow-up effort, It's Time, was truly a tour de force, with masterpieces like Try A Little Tenderness, You And I, and Song For You, among many other great performances. <br /> <br />I suppose I just expected... more. But his latest release falls short of the mark. For me at least. <br /> <br />Vocally, Michael definitely still has it. His trademark crooning and cheekiness are present in abundance, and his 2 co-written originals ( Lost and Everything ) are lovely. <br /> <br />But covers of Always On My Mind and Comin' Home Baby don't really appeal to me, while It Had Better Be Tonight just sounds like a noisy Latin nightclub cabaret act.  <br /> <br />Stand-out tracks, IMHO, include Wonderful Tonight ( gorgeously romantic ), Me And Mrs Jones ( sizzling ), Call Me Irresponsible ( mischievously uplifting ) and Dream ( heavenly ).  <br /> <br />Overall assessment: There's no doubt that this is a good album. However, I wish he could've pushed himself harder and matched -- or better still, exceeded -- the standard he set with It's Time. <br /> <br />I hope his 4th release will do just that. <br /> <br />p.s. My mom and I had the pleasure of meeting him before his concert in Singapore in October 2005. Michael is just as warm, sincere and endearing whether he's on-stage or off, and immensely gifted. We're lifelong fans and wish him a long and extremely successful career.
B000000WHX|5.0|massive attack's 'blue lines' is a classic example of melding deep bass lines, great percussion tracks, fabulous vocals by tricky and shara nelson and inventive samples into the music phenom known as trip hop.<br /><br />many have tried and failed at creating music this good.  this is the kind of sound that can sit in the background or take center stage at any event.  and its inventiveness is matched only by its timelessness. this cd sounds as good now as it did 15+ years ago.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|When a musician dies way too young as is the case with Elliott Smith, there is always a fear of their legacy being tarnished. For us on the outside we have no idea of what Elliott's wishes were. It was clear that others had to make some decisions before they released \\"From a Basement On the Hill\\" so I think it's safe to assume that the songs on the new release \\"New Moon\\" were also left behind with no clear cut idea to what Elliott wanted done with them. Being a fan and loving his music the way I do I would hope that where ever he is, he realizes that these songs are being released for the right reasons. And reason number one is because they are damn good! This is not a 2 cd set of scraps and bottom of the barrel material that he saw unfit to release. But it's a glimpse into the soul of a brilliant and troubled guy who had something to say on many different levels. Many of these songs have been making the rounds between fans for the last couple of years but many times they were of poor sound quality. So it's nice to have cleaned up versions of gems like \\"Placeholder\\" and \\"Going Nowhere\\". The two highlights for me were \\"First Timer\\" and \\"All Cleaned Out\\". If you don't get a chill down your spine when the sweet double-tracked vocals come in on \\"First Timer\\" then you have no soul in my opinion. The hardest thing with a release like this is that it brings back all of those feelings of why?? As in why did he leave us so soon. There is talk that there is plenty more left in the vaults so maybe over the next few years we might get to hear what else was on his mind. It's amazing that songs recorded over 10 years ago by an artist that most people don't know have more soul and meaning then any multi-platinum flavor of the day garbage you hear today. I feel sorry for those who have never heard an Elliott Smith song or album as they are really missing out on something special. <br /> <br />Thanks Again Elliott <br />XO
055358202X|4.0|I believe this was a very good book...but it seems that a lot of books that people hate I really like(Eldest, Traitor to the Blood, MTG series).  You got a very detailed story with many different characters.  GRRM isn't just giving you mainly the \\"good guys\\" story and a small part of the \\"bad guys\\" story.  Except for the fact that depending on your own personality there isn't any definte \\"good or bad\\" guys, you get all sides of the story.  I say \\"all sides\\", because the series doesn't have 2 sides, there are several families all with their own agendas and it can be difficult knowing exactly who is on whose side and why. <br />I may be wrong, but I was under the impression that this was suppoused to be a gigantic book(1000+ pages) and had to be cut in half.  I can see the point in that, but personnaly would have liked to know what everyone was doing at the time, not just half of the characters.  The interduction of the new characters was great, although at times it did seem pointless, but could end up being important in the next books. <br />Something I've liked about the series is that rarely do the chapters overlap each other time wise.  Flashbacks and the rare overlap is necessary, but overall its always moving forward and uses a short explanation of what just happened if a long period of time passed and the last chapter wasn't directly affecting the current one.  I haven't found anything yet for certain, but it seems the next book is suppoused to be covering about this same time, just with the other characters.  This may be a good idea to help catch up with some of my favorites, ie John and Bran, but again I would have rather known a little about everyone than a lot about a few people. <br />Overall it was a really good book.  Like most books, you'll find yourself bored at times and just wanting to skip some charater's chapters, but don't.  There are some small but nice to know pieces in almost every chapter.
B000002IOW|2.0|I'm well aware that they have changed their unique style many times over their 30+ career and they don't look for anyone's opinions other than their own in determining the direction each album takes.    Presto is no different in this vain and it makes what could be their most radical change in direction from one single album (Hold Your Fire) to the next.  Gone are the use of heavy synths which held increasing prominence for 5 straight studio albums (Moving Pictures, Signals, Grace under Pressure, Power Windows and HYF.)  This is not an issue for me.  The real problem is that the keys were not replaced with anything musically.  As a result the songs don't have the depth of any previous releases by this incredibly talented trio.  The songs sound hollow and strangely ordinary.    I hadn't put this CD in the player in years but I did it just this week to give it another chance.  My reaction was the same.  ???  this is Rush?  Where are the crunching, time signature changing, hard rocking, driving parts to these songs?  I do enjoy \\"The Pass\\" and \\"Presto\\" (title track).  But in the end there isn't much to hang your hat on.
B000244FDW|3.0|I have watched four adaptations of Jane Austens book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and I must say that every version has its charm. There are also a number of classic scenes that each adaptation does better than all the others. This version should be mostly for hardcore Austen lovers than seekers of screen romance, I think. It is rather faithful to the book, in dialogue and casting - I don't think any other Darcy I've seen has been prouder than this. He is so proud that it is slightly unbelievable that Lizzie should detect his love, but she is a clever girl and she does and through inner monologue makes sure the audience also gets it. I will certainly watch it many times!
074356619X|5.0|The Law of Attraction explained simply with many different applications and examples. Now I know why I am what I am - and now I know what I can do to make my life so much better. I now understand what it takes to be successful - in anything you choose. One personal example - I pass a fitness center on my way to work every day for the past three years that is less than a half mile from my home - after The Secret, I signed up and have really enjoyed it - I am a lot healthier and have a ton more energy. There is no doubt in my mind that without The Secret, I wouldn't have signed up. Why? Because The Secret caused me to think about what I really, really wanted and a higher level fitness was one of the strongest desires for me. I am now acting in a way that is consistent with what I want. The challenge - and a fun one at that - is conditioning your mind and your feelings towards what you want. I am getting better at it every day. I am not embellishing in stating that The Secret has caused the most positive behavior change that I have ever experienced. I have now bought 17 copies and have been distributing to friends and family - I think it is that effective and that important.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|The trailers for \\"The Good Shepherd\\" looked really exciting; lots of action, etc. Apparently, all 2 minutes of action were packed into that trailer. This is not to say the film isn't worthy; it IS...on many levels. Matt Damon really is one of our current best actors, and he commands attention. The confusing time-shifts weren't helpful; don't know if that was a problem of director de Niro or the editor or writer. There's a terrifc cast, though Jolie was sorely miscast. Alec Baldwin & Damon had some good banter, as they did in \\"The Departed\\". I could watch a film with only those two, and be more entertained than all of \\"The Good Shepherd\\". The historical accuracy of this telling of the founding of the CIA is questionable, and putting it in the same league as Carol Reed's \\"The Third Man\\", or Demme's \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" cannot allow me to put this on my list of favorites. I admire Matt Damon a lot, and he's fine, but the overall result was disappointing for me. Apparently, I missed something, including the 2½ hours of my life that were taken up, and I'm too old to waste the time.
0060853980|4.0|Imagine Rosemary's Baby or The Omen written and starring the talent behind Monty Python and you'll have an idea of what to expect when you read Good Omens.  <br /> <br />Written by satirical fantasy author Terry Pratchett and adult comics and fantasy author Neil Gaiman, Good Omens is a witty and wild take on the Apocalypse myth of the Bible. The main characters are an angel, Aziraphale, and a demon, Crowley, who have both become accustomed to their comfortable lives with humans so have decided to team together to avert The Final Judgement.  <br /> <br />Dark yet heartwarming, Good Omens is British humour delivered through a steady stream of antics, caricature, and an all-round roast to modern society and culture.  <br /> <br />My copy of this novel is prominently displayed on the bookshelf, between a book on Western Atheism and the Holy Bible.
0060935456|5.0|I read this when I was perhaps 8 for the first time. I see all these young people on here saying how boring and 'detailed' it was, and I want to shake my head because it's a shame they can get bored at a book that IS so detailed.  <br /> <br />It's a book about talking rabbits? <br /> <br />No. Sure, the main characters are rabbits that have their own language, but the themes, subjects and concerns of these 'talking rabbits' should strike home to anyone that has the imagination and insight to get past 'lol omg talking rabbits!'. <br /> <br />To this day, this book remains one of the most haunting, touching, and -humane- novels I have ever read. I pick it up every couple of years for a re-read, and it never fails to affect me profoundly in some way. <br /> <br />I also was so enthralled with the story as a child (it is fair to say this book is a 'hard' read for kids under 10 or 12, but it can be done for someone who loves to read and think beyond Harry Potter-class stories) that I had a pet rabbit named General Woundwart.

B00000IMTH|4.0|Rainbow's third album, 1978's Long Live Rock'n'Roll, would be the last to feature original singer Ronnie James Dio. Guitarist and bandleader Ritchie Blackmore's penchant for constantly replacing band members for no good reason and sudden desire to take Rainbow in a more pop-rock direction would soon drive Dio from the group.     A couple of lineup changes took place just prior to the recording of this album. Keyboardist Tony Carey and bassist Jimmy Bain were both ousted, and Rainbow went into the studio without permanent repacements. David Stone was eventually called in to take over the keyboard duties, but how much of the album he actually played on is unclear. What is clear is that none of the keyboard playing on this album is comparable to the stellar work that Carey did on Rainbow's second album, Rising. Bassist Bob Daisley was brought in but only played on a couple of tracks, most of the bass on the album having already been played (very well) by Ritchie Blackmore. Drummer Cozy Powell plays every bit as powerfully as he did on Rising, and both Blackmore and Dio deliver the goods with their customary aplomb. Martin Birch is once again the producer, although this album is recorded in a rawer fashion than Rising, probably on purpose.    Despite the internal problems Rainbow managed to turn in a killer album. While lacking the sheer brilliance of Rising this album has the advantage of being the hardest rocking piece of work in the Rainbow catalog. It kicks like an angry mule, yet still retains flashes of the subtley of their previous efforts. It's not as progressive or experimental as the first two albums and seems to focus more on straight-ahead hard rock. Some great tracks include the Zeppelin-esque \\"Lady Of The Lake\\", the fast-paced concert opener \\"Kill The King\\", and the plaintive ballad \\"Rainbow Eyes\\". Then there's the mighty \\"Gates Of Babylon\\", an eastern-tinged epic that ranks right up there with Rainbow's best. Most of the other tunes are quite enjoyable aswell, if not on the same level as the ones I've mentioned. However the title track, which provided the band with a minor hit, seems forced and generic to my ears.    Of the first three Rainbow albums this is my least favorite, but for all that it's still a great album. After this Ritchie Blackmore threw out everybody except Cozy Powell and formed a new lineup that produced generic mainstream pop-rock. Get this album; it's full of great music and well worth the price.

B000002KKS|4.0|This could easily have been the last gasp for Black Sabbath. Following the artistic and commercial failure of their previous two releases (both of which were abysmal) and the ousting of Ozzy Osbourne (the group's most identifiable member from a media perspective) it seemed that Sabbath was on the skids with no way out. Ronnie James Dio was chosen as Osbourne's successor, having recently parted company with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. The little man with the big voice almost single-handedly pulled Sabbath's career out of the gutter, and in 1980 the mighty Sabs released Heaven And Hell, one of the all-time heavy metal classics.    Anybody who expects this to sound like early Sabbath classics like Paranoid or Masters Of Reality might as well not spend their money. Certainly there are echoes of early Sabbath here, but the addition of RJD to the songwriting team gave the band a much-overdue makeover. There tend to be more up-tempo tunes on a Dio-era Sabbath album, and Dio's sword-and-sorcery lyrical approach is quite a change as well. Another major difference is that while Osbourne would usually follow Tony Iommi's guitar riffs and call them vocal melodies Dio prefers to sing a melody that counterpoints the riff rather than doubling it. The fresh approach seems to rejuvenate the band and Geezer butler (bass), Bill Ward (drums), and Tony Iommi (guitars) deliver performances that are head and shoulders above the tired-sounding musicmanship on the previous two releases. Dio also seems to take inspiration from his new compatriots, singing with an edginess that was never quite there in Rainbow and would be his trademark sound for years to come. Rainbow's old producer Martin Birch was called in to oversee the process, resulting in a crisp, vital sounding recording.    Many of the songs here are timeless classics that are still regular features of Dio's concert performances and were for Sabbath as well until the ill-advised reunion with Osbourne. Some high points include the fast-paced opener \\"Neon Knights\\", the light-yet-heavy \\"Children Of The Sea\\", the hard-rocking \\"Die Young\\", and the slow, mournful \\"Lonely Is The Word\\". Then there's the title track, which is one of those tunes that really has to be heard to be believed. An epic in the best sense of the word; when it's over you can't believe that seven minutes have passed. I subtracted half a star because there is a little bit of filler here. Lady Evil is interesting but in no way does it stand up to most of the other songs on the album, and Walk Away is just fluff. But the rest of the album is so unbelievably great that it's pretty easy to ignore.    If you're a metal fan and don't have this album you need to rectify the situation immediately. Add to cart NOW!

B00000IMTE|4.0|Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had his work cut out for him trying to put together a project that would do justice to the work he had done in Deep Purple. Miraculously he managed it with Rainbow, recruiting singer Ronnie James Dio from Elf, a band that had been opening for Purple for several years. With Dio as a songwriting partner and using the other members of Elf (except for the guitarist) as session musicians he recorded Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. Released in 1975, this powerful debut is at least as good as anything Deep Purple ever recorded and a springboard for even greater things to come.    First the performances. Maestro Ritchie Blackmore whips out his patented guitar histrionics while displaying a level of subtlety and finesse only hinted at in his previous work. Ronnie James Dio proves immediately that he is one of the two or three finest rock vocalists ever, letting loose in a captivating and powerful way. Dio's former Elf bandmates deliver here as well. Drummer Gary Driscoll and bassist Craig Gruber make for a funky and grooving rhythm section, and pianist Micky Lee Soule comports himself well, although he seems a bit restricted by the guitar-oriented sound Blackmore was trying to acheive with Rainbow. The album is reasonably well recorded, but not spectacularly so. This is suprising considering that it's the legendary Martin Birch in the producer's chair. One assumes that deadlines and budgetary restrictions compromised his efforts somewhat.    The songwriting team of Blackmore and Dio is immediately a winner, producing some of the finest rock music in the history of the genre. Dio's melodic sense and sword-and-sorcery lyricism works very well with Blackmore's trademark classically-inspired heavy riffage. Some of the songs here are amongst either man's best, with highlights including \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\" (a staple of Dio concerts to this day), \\"Catch The Rainbow\\" (a gorgeous ballad), \\"16th Century Greensleeves\\" (melodic yet brutal), and the introspective \\"Self-Portrait\\". Most of the other tunes are also very good, and there's a very cool instrumental cover of the Yarbirds classic \\"Still I'm Sad\\". It should be pointed out that Rainbow was still trying to feel out their direction, and there are are obvious leftover elements of both Elf and Deep Purple that make this Rainbow's most interesting and varied release.    So with all these good things to say, why only four stars? Two reasons. Firstly there's a couple of stinkers here. \\"If You Don't Like Rock'n'Roll\\" can only be described as generic filler, and the cover of \\"Black Sheep Of The Family\\" isn't any better (it wasn't a great song to begin with). Secondly the band isn't very well suited to the material; the obvious jazz and blues influences of the previous members of Elf don't always work in this context. Fortunately these men would soon be replaced by the world-class lineup that appeared on the follow-up release \\"Rising\\".     Don't let these reservations throw you. I reserve five-star ratings for albums that are perfect or very close to it, and if I give something four stars that means I like it a lot.     The bottom line: Dio, Blackmore, and \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\". This is an album no rock fan should be without.
B000J10ERO|3.0|It has to be said that doubts presaged my viewing of this revival of the Superman character on the screen. These doubts were only reinforced by some fairly negative responses in this part of the world. Not to mention the fact that the movie had some big shoes to fill following on from the movies with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />As already mentioned, some of the events are borrowed heavily from the previous Superman movies. Of particular note is the scene where Lane and Superman fly together, the crashing of Superman to earth at the beginning and a few other points. However, enough was original to keep it from being purely a re-run. Luthor getting out of prison because the prosecution's prime witness had legged it, (or rather flew the coop), was a nice touch.<br /><br />The computer graphics are probably what stands out, and their quality is fairly good. The special effects are excellent, though you can still tell the CGI when you see it. It is detailed and very well done. Superman's flight sequences are particularly good.<br /><br />The movie has a good pace to it, and it will not leave you looking at the watch. It has a good story line, with Luthor finding out about Krypton and all their technology. I have to admit, Kevin Spacey makes a good Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie. I would not say that it left me breathless, but there is something about Superman that always wins the day. It was a good reprise of the character and a good night's entertainment. However, see it again? I do not think so.
B00000IMTF|4.0|For the follow-up to their superb debut, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and singer Ronnie James Dio recruited a group of world-class musicians to create the definitive lineup of Rainbow. With Cozy Powell on drums, Jimmy Bain on bass, and Tony Carey on keyboards they went into the studio and recorded Rising. This 1976 release is not only Rainbow's finest work but an album that redefined heavy rock in one fell swoop.     Firstly it has to be said that in terms of shear musicmanship this has got to be one of the finest rock bands ever to enter a recording studio. Powell's drumming has to be heard to be believed, and the most amazing thing is that no matter how furiously he bangs the skins it never seems to be overdone; the man never overplays. It's easy to see why he went on from Rainbow to become one of rock's most in-demand drummers. Inventive and solid bass from Jimmy Bain completes an amazing rhythm section, and keyboardist Tony Carey is a virtuoso who can play in any number of styles flawlessly and creatively. Playing with this stellar group seems to bring out the best in Blackmore, who delivers some of the best studio performances of his long career. The same can be said of the extraordinary Ronnie James Dio, who sings like a God all the way through. These killer performances are augmented magnificently by a stellar recording courtesy of veteran producer Martin Birch.    The songs are undeniably some of the best any of these men have ever recorded. Gems like \\"Tarot Woman\\" and \\"Run With The Wolves\\" rock hard without ever sacrificing melody, and the great stomp-rocker \\"Starstruck\\" with it's lyrics about a groupie is tremendously fun. There are also two eight-minute-plus epics here, the hard rocking \\"A Light In The Black\\" and the unbelievable \\"Stargazer\\", the latter of which is Rainbow's best song and one of the all-time great rock masterpieces. Lyrically this album is perhaps the best example of Dio's fantasy-fiction approach to writing.     The impact of this recording on heavy metal can hardly be over-stated. It wasn't a huge seller in it's day, but it's now acknowledged as a vital step in the evolution of the genre and many artists of the upcoming New Wave Of British Heavy Metal site this as a defining influence. Unfortunately it was released during a time when hard rock had been temporarily overtaken in the media by disco and punk music. It was also a little ahead of it's time, which is artistically laudible but not commercially viable.    If Amazon offered a 4.5 star rating that's what this would get. It's an incredible rock masterpiece but I took half a star for the utterly disposable \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\", which sits awkwardly at best with the rest of the songs on this album. Don't let that stop you... this is an absolutely essential hard rock experience.
0439813786|5.0|My mom bought me the Invention of Hugo Cabret. I heard that it was for fans of the Harry Potter series.( I adore the Harry Potter series.) Now I thought that this book  was no way going to be better than the Harry Potter series. But I was terribly wrong. I picked up the book and started reading it at about noon,and did not stop till 4:30. I had finshed a 544 page book (284 pictures are pictures) in four and a half hours without even noticing, IT WAS THAT GOOD!  <br />      Now I will not give away anything that will give away the ending, but it is about a boy who lives in the walls of a train station. He is so poor he steals mostly everything in sight. Then he meets the toy makers daughter, who has a secret of her very own...  <br />       Take it from me, if you like Harry Potter, you will love this!! Even if you don't like Harry Potter, you will still love it. It was way better then any other book I have read. I say the age level is probably 10-adult. I hope there is a sequel!!!!!
B00000IMTG|4.0|Rainbow's live album On Stage was recorded during the promotional tour for the phenomenal Rising album. Released in 1977, it features the band's definitive lineup of Ronnie James Dio on vocals, Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, Tony Carey on keyboards, Jimmy Bain on bass, and Cozy Powell on drums.    The performances here are simply out of this world. These musicians are all at the top of their game and demonstrate an extraordinary ability to deliver the goods live. These were the days when extended onstage jamming was in vogue and this band does it at least as well as Deep Purple (and a lot better than Led Zeppelin). Some of the songs are stretched out to ten minutes or more without ever becoming boring. This is also amongst the best-sounding live recordings you'll ever come across, which comes as no suprise with Martin Birch in the producer's chair.     The setlist is a bit suprising. This was recorded while the band was touring in support of the incredible Rising album, but the only song from that LP that's included here is a partial version on \\"Starstruck\\" stuck into the middle of a medley. Of course this isn't a full concert; a full Rainbow concert was too long to fit onto a double LP in the '70s. For the live album they chose to focus mostly on material from the first album. That actually makes sense to me; it's really great to hear these songs played by the incredible Rising lineup instead of the members of Dio's previous band, Elf. Elf did a good job but Carey, Bain, and especially the late great Cozy Powell make these the definitive versions of tunes like \\"16th Century Greensleeves\\" and a much-extended \\"Catch The Rainbow\\". A couple of real treats here are the Yarbirds cover \\"Still I'm Sad\\" featuring one of Dio's best-ever vocal performances, and a ripping version of Deep Purple's \\"Mistreated\\". The opener is \\"Kill The King\\" which had yet to appear on a Rainbow studio album; it was written specifically to be the show opener and would be recorded the following yearfor the Long Live Rock'n'Roll album. The only thing that I don't like much in this live setting was \\"Man On The Silver Mountain\\" which is played WAY too fast. And although I'm glad we got a good recording of this lineup performing the earlier Rainbow tunes I can't help but be disappointed that \\"Stargazer\\" was cut from the program.    If you don't stress too much over what's not here and focus on what is this is a truly great live album that has stood the test of time. These guys absolutely rip it up on great classic tunes and have great time doing it. Too bad Blackmore would start firing people immediately following this tour.
B000957O82|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for \\"Hitch\\" back in 2004, I couldn't wait to see this movie, because this role seemed tailor made for Will Smith, and it definitely was. Smith as New York City dating consultant Alex Hitchens (aka \\"Hitch\\") is very much like the real Will Smith - tall, dark, handsome, suave, outgoing and humorous. This is quite a change of pace for him since Will is such a huge star of some of Hollywood's biggest action blockbusters (\\"Men In Black\\", \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Bad Boys\\", \\"I, Robot\\", \\"Enemy of the State\\"); romantic comedy isn't something he's done but he is a natural in this role. He's a coach for men looking for serious relationships, not casual flings or one night stands, but have no clue as to how to win over the women of their dreams. He's good at what he does, but only because he was once very much like his clients - \\"romantically challenged\\". He is able to parlay his skills into a very lucrative yet inconspicuous career for himself and he wants to keep it that way.<br /><br />Enter Kevin James (TV's \\"King of Queens\\") as Albert Brennaman - a bumbling, asthmatic accountant who is everything that Hitch is not. He is secretly in love with a rich heiress/socialite, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta, \\"What Lies Beneath\\", \\"Premonition\\"). Albert's company oversees her financial and business interests. But because Albert lacks confidence in himself, and is clumsy, overweight and shy, he thinks he has absolutely no chance in hell of getting with this woman. However, there is a quiet charm and sensitivity about Albert that you can't help but find to be appealing - like a big teddy bear that you just want to hug! He enlists the services of Hitch, who is called \\"The Date Doctor\\", and that's when the fun begins. Hitch teaches him the right things to say, the right things to do, and little by little, the formally inattainable Ms. Cole becomes closer to being attainable to Albert. I thought the scenes between Will and Kevin were hilarious, and they have great on-screen chemistry. Hope to see them paired up in something again in the future.<br /><br />However, Hitch's romantic life doesn't quite flow with the same ease that his clients have. Having his heart broken years earlier has left a lasting impression on Hitch, so he doesn't allow himself to get too close to people he's attracted to - he prefers to keep them at a safe distance. Eva Mendes (\\"Training Day\\", \\"Out Of Time\\", \\"Ghost Rider\\") plays Sara Melas, a gossip columnist who takes her job a bit too seriously and the object of Hitch's affection, but nearly everytime they go out he does something wrong, or something embarrassing happens. I like Eva Mendes as an actress, but I found her character of Sara to be rather obnoxious at times and other than her being attractive, I couldn't understand what Hitch saw in her. I enjoyed her scenes with Hitch when she let her guard down, but for most of the film, she is difficult to like.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie up until three-quarters of the way - then the behavior of certain people started to annoy me with an incident that really wasn't that big a deal. Without revealing too much, I will just say that it was stupid for one person to place blame on someone else for a decision THEY made willingly. This incident was blown so far out of proportion that all of the main characters ended up unhappy. For that reason, I had to dock it one star. However, \\"Hitch\\" DOES conclude with a happy ending so it wasn't all that unpredictable. It has its flaws, but it is definitely worth watching, and one of the better romantic comedies that have been released in the past few years. This is a movie that both men and women can watch and really enjoy - it ain't just another chick flick, guys! :-) I also loved the music and being a lifelong native New Yorker, it was fun recognizing the locations where almost every scene was shot.<br /><br />Sidenote: There are some interesting extras on the DVD, such as deleted scenes that included Hitch's ex from college, Cressida. This explains why the actress who played her, Robinne Lee, is listed as a major member of the cast in the opening credits - however, in the final edit, her role is reduced to just appearing in Hitch's flashbacks. I'm glad they chose not to put those scenes in the theaterical release, because it would have made the film too long (like what was done with the unrated version of \\"The 40 Year Old Virgin\\" DVD). In this case, less was definitely more. :-)is explains why the actress who played her, Robinne Lee, is listed as a major member of the cast in the opening credits - however, in the final edit, her role is reduced to just appearing in Hitch's flashbacks.

1591841666|5.0|Being #1 is worth the effort, but it requires lots of quitting.<br /><br />Most things worth doing can be described by two curves, either a cul-de-sac or a dip.<br /><br />A cul-de-sac is a dead end. The Dip is the \\"hard part\\" between getting started and becoming the best. If you're going to reach a dead end, it's better to quit early. No amount of effort, positive thinking, or anything else will help. The Dip in contrast, requires lots of persistence to get through, but results in enormous success.<br /><br />For example, I rowed crew in high school with Andy Sudduth who eventually made it to the Olympics (twice) and won a medal. I didn't make it to the Olympics - instead I quit, which was the right decision.<br /><br />Why? I enjoyed rowing, I was good, but I could never be great. This cul-de-sac was caused by my leg length. All great rowers need long legs. At 5'10\\", I could never be the best in the world. I'd never make the Olympics, never mind win a medal, no matter how hard I tried.<br /><br />Andy wasn't facing a cul-de-sac. He was taller and otherwise better than I was. He powered his way through The Dip and emerged victorious. There may have been other equally talented rowers, but most people give up even when they are facing The Dip, not a sure dead end.<br /><br />Why is being the best so good? The difference between good and great is vast! How much more does a rock star make than an average excellent musician? I'm a successful business book author, but I probably sell 1% or less of the books Seth does - he's at the top of the heap. People beg him to speak for tens of thousands of dollars. Some people ask me to speak -- for a lot less.<br /><br />Being the best is worth it - is worth the hard work to get through The Dip. Being the best means quitting when you can't be the best.
0451169514|4.0|This seems to be everyone's favorite King book except for me.  It's great and a must read, but if King ever choose a time to ramble on and on (and on and on) this was the book he focused on.

B0000026DJ|5.0|My single favorite band of all time - nothing will ever come close. This album is a great introduction to their sound. Full of incredible passion, powerful lyrics, unreal guitar solos, and creativity and originality in every song. The popular Beds are Burning is not even in my top 5 songs on this album (Sell My Soul is #1, and possibly my number 1 song of all time. Dreamworld is pretty special too).  <br /> <br />If you fall in love with the album, as I did, you can move onto some of their older stuff - 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, or Red Sails in the Sunset are similarly incredible, and even more creative.  <br /> <br />The Oils are truly a special band, and 6 years after their breakup, I still pop in my mix CD's in the car when my kids aren't around. I'll never understand why they didn't become as popular as, say, U2 or REM - they are all that and more. But I suppose it makes it that much more amazing for the die hard fans that still rave about the Oils to this day. <br /> <br />Hope you enjoy  - I'm pretty certain you will. <br />
0151013047|1.0|I found it flat and uninspired.  And I absolutely hated the monologue/conversation style.  It was more of a distraction than anything.  To be honest, some of the reviews I've read here were more interesting than the book was.

I love the the bright colors of the set and costumes. The Mel Gibson version was way to dark and it was crap compared to this one. Hamlet is so much more likable. I thought Kate Winslet as Ophelia was perfect!! I loved it. I never cried watching Hamlet till this.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|My wife and I watched \\"Planet Earth\\" on the Discovery channel recently.  I am astounded at the professionism in making this documentation.  I always admired the photography of \\"National Geographics\\", and in comparison, this is just as good if not better.   <br />My only regret, is that I am buying this DVD set for my grandchildren ages 6 and 4, and I am afraid that some scenes will leave a certain amount of sadness when they see some of the anamils eating others, i.e., a pack of lions eating an elephant.  This is nature for sure, but I think children at the young age will have difficulty comprehending this sort of scene.  It would have been nice if there was a separate set available that does not depict scenes as mentioned above.  Perhaps I can warn the parents to view the scenes before showing them to the children. <br />All in all, great work and a whole lot of kudo's to the members of the crew that went to great lengths to bring this type of documentation to us.
B000021XR5|5.0|With the exception of 'Glide', this is a perfect album to me. From the lyrics to the unusual melodies, the crunching guitars and tight bass/drums combo, this is an album that begs to be played very LOUD! Everything from grunge, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, and The Beatles are represented here in terms of influences and song writing styles, but none of these compositions in any way rip those artists off; STP make them their own, and play the hell out of them. Scott has rarely sounded more at home, and the energy on this album makes it one of the finest STP outings ever. Plus the great production never hurts!! Something most rock and metal fans would appreciate...
B00000IMTF|5.0|Even after three decades, this CD still hold up as one of the best in the whole 'progressive metal' genre; Whether it's the stellar drumwork by Cozy Powell(one of the best drummers...like...ever...), the powerful vocals by Ronnie James Dio, or the masterful guitarwork by Blackmore, this is one of those CD's that is a milestone in just about every way. It represents 5 players at the top of their game, with all the right material, and everyone is allowed to shine. Where alot of Rainbow albums are spotty in terms of the compositions, this one gets them all right; 'Tarot Woman' still remains one of the best Rainbow songs ever, and while I have heard this 'album' over 300 times since it's release back in the mid '70's, I'm still impressed. Those looking to be introduced to Rainbow can do no wrong here; Truly a cornerstone in the genre, and certainly required listening. Sounds even better remastered!!
B000NVIXDW|3.0|Upon first listen, I did not notice the lisping. But now after reading the reviews here and going back for a re-listen, it's almost comical on several songs! It's like getting a bonus game with the album. <br /> <br />I think this is the least-best of his 3 albums so far. I don't want to say it's his \\"worst album\\" because that would imply that it sucks - which it doesn't. Needless to say, if you liked the first two, you'll enjoy this one too. I liked it, just not as much the first two. <br /> <br />My main complaint is it seems a little slow-paced, especially toward the end.  The first half is noticeably stronger than the back half.  There are a few yawners toward the end which I almost found to be sleep-inducing.   <br /> <br />I love Buble though; he's a great performer. He embodies the hipster coolness better than all of the other so-called Sinatra ripoffs. Buble needs to set up a night show in Vegas - wouldn't that be awesome?  <br /> <br />Anyway, it's great to hear that nice, quality new music is still being made in this timeless genre of vocal jazz standards.  Keep on keepin' on.
159562015X|5.0|I took the original Strengthfinders and loved the 39 different categories of strengths. Our WOMEN Unlimited Northeast leadership team used StrengthFinders 2.0 to compare and contrast our strengths with each other. We had a virtual meeting to review the results and to acknowledge what's important to each other. <br /> <br />These original strengths were reviewed and updated so some have changed in 2.0 which is fine. Some of my strengths shifted and the results ring true to me. Using these strengths 2.0 for a team--or even as an individual--is very insightful for (1) how you present and show yourself to others, (2) how you find work that honors your strengths instead of taking a job just because it's open and (3)knowing your needs to allow you to fulfill them. <br /> <br />My only regret is that Woo disappeared from my strengthsfinder the second time.  I loved describing myself as having Woo--winning others over. And I'll choose to keep that because it works for me! <br />
B000002KDX|5.0|early 70's Warner/Reprise period music is the bomb (america, van dyke parks grateful dead, beach boys, too many cool artists doing cool music on this label at the time!) If you like Crosby Stills Nash and Young, you will like these guys. Good guitar and great harmonies. But listen to a track like Jawbone and you realize these guys can rock out like a mellowed out led zep or neil young.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|This show was one of the very best of its kind I have ever seen> Liza was at her top-notch best that night and this DVD has captured it in a rare moment of superb talent being reproduced by the technology of the day. Both are seldom seen with such clarity,color and sheer fun to watch.I confess I am prejudiced where Liza is concerned since the night I saw her live with Frank and Sammy. Nobody did it like Liza,even her moyher. Sadly,her demons threaten to overtake her now but buy this DVD and re-live one of the great moments in entertainment history.
B000LC55F2|3.0|I missed this movie in the theater, but I always wanted to see it. So when I ordered the dvd I couldn't wait to watch it. I was wondering what twists and turns it had and there were many, but esthetically, I was put off by the intensity of the rivalry and the form it took. It was just too dark. I can say it was a top notch production, with convincing performances and meticulous details, but it's not for everyone. The lengths these men go to is unsettling and sad. If you tend to like the modern trend toward dark movies without a satisfactory resolution, this may be for you. Otherwise, I can't recommend it.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Ben Stiller is hysterical in this unique comedy set in the world of jet-setting male models. Stiller has once again knocked it out of the park with his hysterical portrayal of Derrick Zoolander. Blue Steel and Magnum forever!!!
B000007492|5.0|I bought this to restock the Cd's having owned the vinyl album for over 20 yrs. I was not dissapointed, all those early memories coming back when I first heard this again. Pure nostalgia and neither the music or the lyrics have dated over the years. A true super group. Go on give yourself a treat and buy this cd, you will not be dissapointed.
1405304677|5.0|This book is sturdy and will last many years.  This book has good illustrations and has really helped me to learn several knots easily.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I bought this for my Lady,( Thats my excuse ) she just loves it. I had never paid much attention to this artist but it suddenly caught me unawares. His music to me borders a little opera but in a modern musical way. Maybe not for todays youth but I guarantee when the romance hits them later in life this will be the stuff to relax to. Very passionate moody music. Not your usual fluffy ballad stuff that is all around us. Thank you Josh for making life a little more enjoyable.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|This is Great Movie!!!!  A sad, violent, real history about the human absurd in Sierre Leone. the actors did a very good job.
6304779356|5.0|The great thing about this dvd is on one side is the 'full screen' version , and the other side is the 'Widescreen' (2:35) version. Its cool when dvds come with both versions!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Yikes, what with new A/V effects, and the predilection of our current generation of movie makers, (and watchers), to seek ever greater thrills, and spills, this movie is violent and brutal.  I am sure the effect will wear off over time and my intellectual detachment will go into overide, but so far I have only been able to watch it once.
B00004XMTJ|4.0|The delivery was fast and the price was fair, but I was disappointed that as a commemorative edition there was no poster, booklet, anything at all in the case other than the cd.  It led me to wonder if this was indeed a brand new item as advertised.
087349976X|5.0|This is a great book for all levels of crafters. It has easy to follow instructions and great detailed pictures. The projects included in this book are very stlyish. I am extremely pleased with the purchase of Bead & Wire Art Jewelry.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|In my opinion, there are the matrix fans, and THE MATRIX FANS.  If you fall into the later, this is a must have item.  All the movies, the inbetweens and production clips.  Beautiful case.
B000IU3Y3W|4.0|The music's fantastic-the dvd is not much-just the same few photos over & over & over-c'mon!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|This show is very great!!! I like it!!  the boys are good, they sing very well and also they dance very well. The show is good, funny and remarcable. Bsb rock!!!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a great album.  But more importantly this is of historic significance.  A must!  Buy this if you are a blues fan!  Buy this is you are not a blues fan!  Buy this and increase your knowledge of American music.  The dvd is a knockout!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The story is one of childhood love torn between social classes; as the inevitable starts to rear itself, the boy leaves, travels the world, and learns the art of illusion.  He returns to his home years later as an astounding magician.  During one performance, his childhood love comes up on stage, and their passion is rekindled, although the social status issue has not been resolved.  Her aristocratic life puts her in danger of an abusive crowned prince who abuses his diplomatic immunity.  A murder is committed, and the movie follows the investigation. <br /> <br />The details of the plot are somewhat predictable, but the story is well told and enjoyable.  It appeals equally well to both genders.
0743496728|5.0|There were times I wanted to run from the story and times that I could not put the book down.  A crystal clear example of truth that is painfully hard to swallow. I encourage parents to read this book for it's insight into a disturbing social problem that must be addressed for the good of us all.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|The sixth year of this century would go down as a year when all the old horses gave what they got .. and finshed with astonishing results. Stones rolled, Plant grew, Paul resurrected and Bobbie proved again that he ain't gonna leave the building quietly.  <br /> <br />For us, who started listening to Dylan in mid to late eighties, that's a real treat.  <br /> <br />I remember growing up in Calcutta, when listening to counter culture classics and watching Ray movies meant the coolest thing in the world ( a far cry from today's decadent mainstream behaviour, you see), and Dylan was crawling through a dark decade. Darkest were the years when we saw releases like Knocked Out Loaded and Down In The Groove. Both got issued on vinyl LPs which we promptly procured with our pocket money, little that we had, only to realize that these recordings did not stand a chance agains the earlier gems of the previous decades (way before the times of online reviews and thirty second intros on itunes, you had to buy to listen to judge .  <br /> <br />We did not realize that as much we anticipate masterworks from the living legends everytime, it's just not possible to deliver a classic everytime you happen to be in the studio.  <br /> <br />I, for one, had given up. Content with what I had from the sixties & seventies.  <br /> <br />Keeping that in mind the new resurgence of Mr. Dylan appears both fantastic and spectacular. I have not had a chance to write reviews on the the earlier two studio albums: Time Out of Mind and Love & Theft, both classics and will stand the test of time much like Highway 61 or Blood on Tracks.  <br /> <br />It would appear, at least to me, that Bob, in his sixties and reliving the sixties. Backed by a class act, second maybe only to 'The Band' in the seventies, he tears through a collection that matches with the best in class.  <br /> <br />If the younger buckaroos are producing music half as good as this, forty years on, I will consider myself to be damn lucky.  <br /> <br />As for the album, many many words have been spent in reviewing Modern Times (the best that I have read was on Uncut, a British magazine). I don't have any intention to rehash the same .. it's a great album, Dylsn's third classic in a row and consider yourself fortunate that you are sharing your mortal time with Dylan, and that he has not stopped amusing you.  <br /> <br />Keep on rolling, Abraham!! Modern Times, whatever may that be, both for you and me .. this is our time!!
B000NA1OXY|4.0|Avril Lavigne's new album contains all the elements that made her previous recordings so successful: catchy pop melodies often infused with a fun rock beat, with some nice ballads thrown in the mix, full of simple but cute lyrics that will please her core demographic (young girls and the rest of us who view her music as a guilty pleasure).  Her new album features more of a punk vibe.  If you liked her previous releases, you should like this one too.  If I were to rank her albums, I'd say this one is slightly better than her last one but her first album is probably still the best.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I found this film mind blowing, and l shun the reviews that say it wasnt \\"enjoyable\\"...its primary purpose wasnt to be enjoyable! It was meant to INFORM- which it did.  What I dont understand is how the h--- Bush was RE-elected after this film was made?!!? This movie gave such insight into the crookedness of politics and how Bush and his crew are profiting financially from the moves they make. Michael Moore did a great job, bottom line, he uncovered numerous facts that most of the public is unaware of and really NEEDS to be aware of. George Bush should NOT be in the position he's in, and the clips of him in the movie really show his smug, arrogant characteristics. Dont get me wrong, he's great for a laugh. (His verbal slip ups, quite amusing...and his statement when he choked on that pretzel- l giggled..) l think EVERY american should see this film. The fact that the title of the documents Bush recieved months prior to Sept 11 was \\"Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.\\" and yet they were STILL ignored, is unbelievable. He was too busy on his Texas ranch and playing golf to take it seriously and now look what has happened. My favorite part of the film was when Michael Moore is standing outside the building where all the congress members are coming in, and he's handing out military recruiting brochures, asking members of congress to consider getting THEIR children to enlist and go serve our country! They look at him like he's insane - it's priceless. See this movie, and convince everyone you know to see it. What have you got to lose? You're sure to come away from this movie with some astonishing information...
B00008RH3L|5.0|Hard to find faults; only nits, like the fact that the many injuries Byrne should accumulate thru film should hospitalize him. Great acting, photography, the usual Coen kinkiness (not overdone), and a deliberate pacing that is nearly perfect. Characters are clearly defined and credible, even when their personalities are eccentric. The only thing missing is the lack of a feature-length commentary on the DVD. <br />I highly recommend this movie.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I thought, a very moving look at the band through Page's eyes and heart. <br />KIller end of concert \\"filler\\" tv shows in Europe. Wow! Don't miss the last footage from 79' where Plant and Page are strangers on stage; you can actually feel the tension as they perform (Plant left at end of this tour).  <br />Having played frisbee with Plant and JP on a Malibu beach in 73', I was moved by the sincerity Page reveals (if you look!)
0743550927|5.0|...even if you have read the book, it's a wonderful experience to hear Frank McCourt tell the story himself. Unless you really don't have the time or inclination, do yourself a favor and buy (or borrow) the unabridged version (12 CDs). It really is a delight and privilege to listen to McCourt telling HIS story. One gets so much more insight into the mood of each event whether it be heartbreaking, frustrating or funny. I cannot speak highly enough of the book, and even more highly of the audio book. Some books are just worth hearing - this is one of them.
B00005LC1H|5.0|this is a classic british sitcom that has the slighty on the edge of sanitity basil fawlty running around like a headless chicken it is a must see so buy it now!
B000J10ERO|5.0|Wonderful show.  We saw the movie and decided this is one we want for our own collection.
0634060384|4.0|The new addition is good, but it isn't comprehensive. There's some older material, some of it Broadway-based but still certainly in the canon of standards, that I think were in earlier additions but aren't in this one. Check the contents before you assume everything you want is here. I'd probably have been better off with an older edition for the background gigging I occasionally do, particularly for solo piano.
B00003CX96|5.0|I attended IU and I very much enjoy watching this movie again and again.  It was a well written screenplay and adapted well to a movie version.
0385512058|5.0|Phenomenal Read for anyone interested in pursuing any professional career (this book can benefit anyone)!  Keith has some great advice, and he does a wonderful job conveying those ideas...get it, read it, apply it!!!
074356619X|5.0|All the hype is reallly true!  I have changed my life around this book.
B000NA2776|4.0|When I put this in my CD player I was all what the heck is this.  Week later I was dancing and bopping in my car, doing cleaning at home, and even even  \\"pretending\\" to excersize to it.   Even my 8 year old neice wont let me take it outta the player.  Its fun old school pop, with elton john, and queen influence.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm glad I decided to give this show a chance.  Fellow fans of other Sci-Fi shows I watch all told me I should check out Firefly.  It really was an enjoyable, if brief, ride.  This show really is a western in space, which is basically what Star Trek was originally called in order to sell it to a network.  Who would have thought you could put people on a spaceship, as well as give them cowboy hats and horses, and still have it work out so well.  At the heart of this show is some fantastic drama and a wonderful cast of characters.  Even with only 13 episodes, each of the series regular's comes forward as a memorable character with a unique personality.  By the time this show was cancelled they had barely scratched the surface, yet already there was enough substance to hold a loyal following of diehard fans, who eventually were able to convince the studio to bring the franchise back for a movie.  Firefly is a milestone in television history.  It is not to be missed.
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut was the most brilliant mind alive at the turn of the century.  It is an utter shame that he died recently, but so it goes.  In my opinion, this is his finest work.  He satorically questions religion, war and the nature of man all in one hillarious masterpeice.  He is the Mark Twain of the 1900's.  I recomend EVERYONE read this novel.
B00007GZQI|2.0|strange movie, very dated. <br />it was better when i was 13. (in the 70's). <br />
B00006RIO7|5.0|I got this for a very close friend last Christmas. She is completely and utterly fascinated by this movie, its woman empowerment, the dancing, and especially (I eventually agreed) the fantastic lyrical and musical composition.  <br /> <br />It's in her stereo, her mp3, HER HEAD, all the time. She adores it. <br /> <br />I'm not much for musicals, but I admit, the few scenes she made me watch were pretty nifty...
B000NDIAWO|5.0|What could be better than Beyonce? Beyonce plus Shakira plus Alejandro Fernandez. Bravo.
0723257639|5.0|I'm a young adult, and I had most of the collection as a kid. <br /> <br />I was perusing amazon, just for fun, and saw this set for a hundred bucks... I showed my sister....she encouraged the purchase...and I bought it. I'm in college, so a hundred bucks is like a thousand. It's a GREAT BUY, no doubt; this is a timeless collection, and this edition is a step up than the previous. <br /> <br />No regrets. Keeping it for my own kids.
B00005RYL2|5.0|I have seen this movie a quite a few times. It's one of my favorites. I was suprised with added scenes.
0143038419|5.0|I know it sounds trite, but this book literally changed my life. I completely and utterly identified with the author and adored her narrative and colloquial writing style.
B000E9910W|5.0|This double CD set is one of the best greatest hits compilations I've heard in a long time.  If you want Doobies to listen to and don't know what CD to throw on, get this one.  You have all the hits and more right here.  A must for any Doobies fan!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I can't believe what I have been missing! If you love genre shows like the X-Files, then this show is for you. Dark and moody, action packed with great special effects, great writing and imagination, first rate acting that ranges from slapstick comedy to tragic drama, stand alone and mythology building episodes, all in all--a DVD set that will draw you in. What I love best about this show is how it takes science fiction's/Horror's favorite archetypes and gives it's own twist. You have the 'evil doubles', 'machinery taken over by another intelligence', 'Luke Skywalker/Han Solo (the two Winchester brothers), the big 'too powerful for it's own good' bad guy constantly in the back ground, spirituality/faith versus non-belief, the hero's journey (the cost of fighting a war on the individual), what truely makes something/someone a 'monster', and of course, 'good vs. evil'. This was one purchase that I felt like I got more than I paid for.
1596680180|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to start making my own cores for embellishing with beads and decorative ends and cords to showcase focal beads from the multitude of gorgeous hand-dyed embroidery floss out there.  <br /> <br />This book provided thousands of design possibilities and is an instant favorite in my collection. Each braid is very clearly illustrated, and includes several variations (all shown in photos) for each braid based on strand thickness or type of cord. Exact instructions for each variation is also provided--I have never seen a book so detailed. For someone like me who gets frustrated seeing something I like in the gallery or variations section of a book but then can't reproduce it, this is a great idea. <br /> <br />I was also pleased that the title \\"200 Braids\\" was true. Usually when books say they include X number of something, what is often included are a number of pretty close variations and quite a few uninspired items just to fill the quota given in the title. Not the case here. 200 unique braids give you a lot to choose from.
1582701709|5.0|I believe this book is so valuable, it should be a part of the curriculm in every school in the nation. Everyone on this planet needs to read this book. All I can say is buy this book, you'll cherish it forever.It will give you deep understanding about the life your living and creating the life you want to live.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is in my opinion the best James Bond of them all.  Most of the action scenes are real and not computer generated like in the previous films.  This is truely one of the best films in the bond franchise and I would recommend any person to add this to their dvd collection.
B00003CXBH|1.0|My disappointment is because, having received the disc, I found it would not work in European format. The subject of the film was the basis of a discussion I had with several friends when the bi-centenary of the abolition was discussed. I told of this film which I had seen in the UK some years back. As I could neither see it nor show it, I lost my argument!!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|What a way to go out!!!  This is one of my favorite Rocky's.  It was a great end to a legacy of Rocky's.
B000777J2S|4.0|I had been recommended this singer and the music by family abroad. It came up to the glowing reports they gave of it. Thanks!
B000FIMG68|4.0|I watched lost I and was itching to see LostII and feel just as strongly about viewing III,but the only way I can imagine thoroughly enjoying this program is sans the commercials. <br /> <br />The acting is refreshingly good,especially since it's stars are not the usual household names.I can appreciate the opportunity for the writers to be able to extend the story for as long as it takes to disect each and every survivors life.As long as the story-line remains in the realm of reality-I shall be a fan. <br /> <br />
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I bought this CD at the beginning of the week and I've been listening to it endlessly.   If you like this album very likely you will like his past two albums.
0930289528|5.0|This book is estupendous. It's nothing like the movie even better than the movie. It's worth the price. The only thing is that the book is in color and not in black like it's original print, but worth reading. You will not be disappointed, it's a page turner like Stephen King's books.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This film was full of energy, singing, dancing. My grandaughters liked the film as much as the stage play.
0345479092|5.0|when you have a baby, you'll probably wish it came with a manual... well, this book is the closest you'll get to it... i recommend this book to every future mom! tracy was able to give simple and easy to follow methods on creating rountine for you and your baby. 100% worth reading!
0783229372|4.0|The Film was very entertaining.  Show details of the actually account.  I reall enjoyed it
B000BF0D9M|5.0|My husband and I had never heard of Jesse Cook, but we like Flamenco music so we went to see him live. The show was outstanding, and this CD has some of his best songs on it. If you want something uniquely different to listen to, this is it. The music is a blend of Spanish, African, and Island sounds. Very nice.
1594481717|5.0|Daniel Pink was a keynote speaker at the National Art Education Association National Conference in NYC in March and makes an incredible argument for the values of Arts Education in our modern society. He was preaching to the choir with so many Right Brained Art Teachers in the room but is himself a Left Brained Lawyer who is trying to enhance his creative thinking skills to better fit our world. Highly recommended book- another Art Teacher and myself bought numerous copies for the administrators in our district.
B000MQ54OO|5.0|Absolutely the best picture and sound I've experienced yet on HD-DVD.  A demo title all the way--put this one in your platter to show your friends what \\"The Look and Sound of Perfection\\" is all about!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I watched Dr. Who in the late 70's and 80's and enjoyed the show (though sometimes the plot lines would drag on a bit, & special effects were quite cheesy). But the new Dr. Who series is far superior to those older shows. The budget and visuals are much more substantial, and the writing, characters and pace of the new episodes is wonderful. I especially love Christopher Eccleston's portrayal of The Doctor. He is Brilliant! I've heard David Tennant is very popular in the second series, (I've only seen one so far) but I really miss Christopher. Any Science Fiction fan, and especially a Dr. Who fan, would really enjoy this DVD.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Seriously... do I even need to review it? What sci-fi fan wouldn't want the best almost 100% compuer made movie of it's time period?
B00064X8M2|5.0|This is obviously a collector's item, but for really huge fans, this vinyl classic is a really cool version of one of Incubus' best CDs.  It's a fully playable CD that works in any CD player, but it looks like an old vinyl single record.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Very good movie with lots of surprises you wll not go to sleep watching this one !
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Great movie!  In great condition!  I would definately recommend this movie to ANYONE that is looking at it.  If you're a movie a lover like me and grew up watching movies with your parents and learning movie quotes and using them in your conversations, then I'm talking to you ESPECIALLY!  This is a movie you don't want to pass off!  I love this movie SO much!
B000NQR7NO|2.0|so what, they sound a little like the strokes, killers, and the bravery mixed together and I dislike all those bands especially the killers. Oh and you can't forget about the vines. And do all these cookie cutter bands have an ipod commercial?
0060578793|5.0|This is the type of book to have if ever lost anywhere. Information is not sugar coated.
B000MV9026|3.0|Without question, Mumble the Penguin is adorable.  The music throughout this winter musical should appeal to a wide audience, and the computer animation is great.  On a downside, the plot is a little thin.  It borrowed heavily from the story line and info shared in March of the Penguins.  I also felt the movie was marketed to a younger crowd in commercials but is really more appropriate for teens and adults.  Since I tap as a hobby, I'm glad I got to see it.  Not on my list of favorite movies though...
B00005JPCF|5.0|This is a great movie. It shows facts about penguins in a way that kids understand. And is very amusing. I love Robin Williams in this, he is great. Wonderful movie, great for the whole family.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|This movie was certainly an adaptation.  The characters were not as I envisioned in my head when I read Jane Austen's novel.  I think that because so much was cut it was hard to see how characters developed so quickly.  Some of the actors were downright obnoxious.  I have not seen the A&E version yet but I think I would have preferreed it over this one.  Although this review seems harsh, I think it is a decent movie for someone who has not read the book first. I wish I rented this instead of buying it.
0679805273|5.0|Every year I give this book to graduationg seniors who I had in my second grade classroom.  We have a reunion picnic, open a time capsule, and sit around and read this book as they start on a new path of life.
B000J103PC|5.0|Very good movie. Very good acting. I watched it a few times over, already. I love this movie. Merryl Streep and Ann Hathaway were fabulous.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|ok..I bought this for one song and the more I played the CD the more songs I came to like.  It's a little bit repitious, could use some rhythym variation as well as intros to the songs, but I like heavy base and bluesy qualities....think the group could grow on me.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|A very good series. Ten beautiful years of great comedy and drama. It is a definite classic.
1596680199|5.0|I've bought quite a few books on polymer clay but this is the best one so far.  It has clear step by step instructions and photos which takes the reader from the very beginning of the process of making beautiful polymer clay beads to finished pieces of jewelry.  What else could any polymer clayer wish for?  Excellent book for the beginner right through to the more experienced.  I have learnt some new techniques which I love, in particular the combining of oil paints with polymer clay which makes the finished product look like enameling or the technique for making faux stones.  Just brilliant!
B000NA2776|5.0|This CD is Amazing!  I would give this CD twenty stars if I could.  I have listened to this with all my friends and they all love it.  I will bet that MIKA will become the next BIG worldwide phenomenon.  This sound is original but his voice is totally cool. Original with a twist of Freddy Mercury.  I listened to Grace Kelly before I bought the CD and I was afraid the rest of the songs wouldn't live up to how great that was but they do.  I have found songs I will LOVE forever on this CD.
0793542049|5.0|I new to playing the bass guitar and have not read music before. The lessons start out just right easy to understand.
0618477942|4.0|This book is unlike any other I have ever read: a literate, complex and absorbing comicbook.  But then again the author had a childhood quite unlike others.   <br />In the 20/21 centuries, what can we possibly do with the pressure of our private tangled childhood pasts, especially if we eliminate the random killing, depths of alcoholism routes?   <br />We can make art. Bechdel has used hers to make art of a high order in a book that is utterly 21st century: quick to read, nuanced and compelling, making the idiosyncratic universal.
1582701709|5.0|This book is making a difference in people's lives by showing them that they are in charge of their lives and what happens. How we think and feel is an important element to what happens to us and we can control those things.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I loved the 80's pop included on this soundtrack-it remind me of Wham!-remember them? My favorite though is the song Hugh Grant and Drew Berrymore sing together, \\"A way back into love\\".  I had to have this cd the moment after I saw the movie!!!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Most of the new CD is good the music is awesome, but the they are forcing melody to an unmusical and unworkable lyric set, like a lot of country music. Vapor Trails sound with extras. At least on VT Earthshines grabs you. I haven't found anything similar on this one. Having read Ghost Riders, VT comes in as a my 3rd favorite. Hemispheres is 1st then Moving Pictures.
B000N3SS80|5.0|The songs are good, most of them great. It is not the Jennifer Lopez we are used to hear, but definitly she did a great job. Music, instruments, rythm in great harmony with her voice. Very nice one.
B000N3SS80|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jennifer Lopez and was thrilled to hear she had a new album in Spanish. It fulfilled my expectations! Her Spanish is clear and lyrical.
B000GFLE86|4.0|I love this calming, yet quietly powerful music. I've listened to it again and again and it always has a magical effect.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|From the opening chase scene to the closing moments of this film, I was riveted. I love the intelligence, the passion, the simplicity, the beauty of this new Bond. Forget Spiderman, Superman, Cat Woman, X-men, Superheroes--we've got a breathing, human beast in BOND.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|What an interesting, fun, quirky series. A space opera and cowboys combined. Interesting concept. They really should have kept it on the air. <br />Excellent ensemble cast as well. Who knows what passes for thinking and judgment in a television executives mind.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'll admit that most of you guys are probably skeptical since its a show where a serial killer is the good guy. <br /> <br />Just...the show needs to be seen. Watch the first episode and you'll be instantly hooked. <br /> <br />Michael C. Hall gives us one of the most complex and interesting characters to come on television in the last decade. His acting is superb on every level and the kind of role that never would have existed without method acting. After Hall, the next acting award from me goes to Julie Benz. As much as I liked her on Angel, this is on a different level. She has the hardest job because she has to understand all of the subtext and still be oblivious to it. Not an easy thing to do. <br /> <br />The dark comedy of the series works perfectly ever time. <br /> <br />The dialogue glimmers with subtext on every line. <br /> <br />The show is so good that it even manages to get one of the most ridiculous Silver Age comic book cliches ever to work plausibly (I won't give away what it is though). <br /> <br />With this series, Showtime went from a solid record of series to surpassing an HBO network that has struggled for a few years to find the next big thing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a wonderful show with intriguing storylines and rich characters. It has moments of drama, intrigue, action, romance and lots of fun. The fact that Josh Whedon and the fans were able to convince the studios to shell out millions of dollars to make the movie AFTER the show was cancelled is a testament to the show itself. Be sure to watch the entire season THEN watch the movie Serenity.
0783240287|5.0|We had this movie before and wore it out watching it. I had to buy another one.  It is still the best movie I have seen in a long time.   Wish I had seen it in person.
B00005JA2B|5.0|By now it is fairly well known that the album Leftoverture contains lyrics written by Kerry Livgren during his years of spiritual searching.  As Kerry himself wrote in his book \\"Seeds of Change,\\" the albums Leftoverture, and its follow up, Point of Know Return, are excellent listening for those considering Christianity. <br /> <br />Kerry's lyrics reflect the struggle of not knowing for sure what life is all about, but each song always seems to end on a hopeful note.  From Carry on Wayward Son:  \\"Now your life's no longer empty--surely heaven waits for you.\\"  From The Wall:  \\"Smiling back at all who wait to cross--there is no loss.\\" <br /> <br />And of course, the music of Kansas is just great!  The combination of rock and blues with violin makes them unique in the annals of popular music. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this CD.
B00005JLT5|5.0|should be seen by everyone. no doubt, there are good Germans, there are bad Germans--but what Hitler and the Nazis did should never, ever be forgotten.  <br /> <br />some of the scenes are quite painful to witness, as they should be: human beings, absolutely innocent of any wrong-doing, stripped of their dignity, left to starve to death, beaten, shot, seperated from family and loved ones, loaded up on trains to be taken to the death camps...will leave your eyes welling...and this is exactly why the film is a must-see. <br /> <br />you don't have to be Jewish to relate to those who suffered and were put through the living hell. <br /> <br />I applaud Roman Polanski for his impeccable direction.
B000N6TX22|3.0|I really thought the characters were believable and the sets were great.  The problem came from the motivations of why people were doing what they were doing.  It made no sense for the government to try to deport people from a country whose population was becoming rapidly depleted.  If sterility was rampant, wouldn't the gov try to bring in as many women from all over the world as possible and test for feritilty??? This is a big logic flaw.  And low and behold, it IS in immagrant who becomes preggers.  The point is that the whole thing is so metaphorical that the plot is unrealistic. (The Messege:  Left/Right Politics have become \\"sterile\\"  We need to get beyond what we know, go out into the fog, to \\"catch the ship of tomorrow\\") Bleh.  What makes the film interesting are the characters created by the actors and the cinenatography, which is excellent.
B000002G7G|5.0|Much more quiet than the other Velvet releases, so if you love them purely for their noisier tracks ala sister ray, don't bother with this one. If you like their slow emotional songs though, this album is packed full of slow and beautiful songs. Candy says and Jesus are the standout tracks.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This movie guides you step by step through the nine different insights. It was inspirational, eyes-opener and interesting. It explains concepts such as the law of attraction, energy exchange and relationships in a very simple way. A must-see if you are in the search of your higher-self.
B00005YJMX|5.0|This film is a wonderful reinterpretation of the 1922 original.  It includes dialogue by the characters, while still maintaining a sense of being more visual than audio-based. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who loves the Dracula mythology, especially if you like the 1922 original.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|This is one excellent concert DVD! Picture and sound very good for an older concert. Widescreen format looks great. All their big songs. A must have for any AC/DC fan.
B000N6TX22|5.0|It's very hard to categorize Children of Men and identify it as a thriller movie or something. <br />Children of Men just is, it's unique and well worth experiencing!
B000002R48|3.0|OK for a debut but not up to par with the rest of their work.
0786670665|2.0|Tommy Emmanuel's cd's and dvd's are tremendous. But this \\"book\\" by Mel Bay Publishing is a joke. Why? Because it is the equivalent of 6 pages long. I could not believe this was ever priced at $15. It is a tiny step up from the free music folders stores hand out. It should have had much more material, or cost much less money and been labeled a sampler.<br />I've been around the music industry for decades; this offers little value.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A great family movie. Dont expect any crashes, explosions, or special effects. A true story about a simple man on a quest to visit his dying brother. This movie needs to be seen from beginning to end, so don't start it unless you have the time to watch all of it. The director did not allow a chapter guide in the DVD for this reason.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Once again Clutch does it. Every time these guys cut a new album, it is completely amazing. Their style is forever changing, but their foundation is always rock-solid. When a new album comes out, it is like Forrest Gump's mom said - \\"Life's like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get!\\" <br /> <br />You may not know, but it is always pleasant surprise (like getting those chocolates with the liquor flavoring on the first try. <br /> <br />If you are a Clutch fan, I need not say more than buy this album, if you are wondering about the boys from Maryland - let them take you on audio chocolate tasting. <br />
B000007492|5.0|After listening to this music 20 years ago and forgetting about it, the internet radio station played it a few tunes.  I had forgotten just how good this music was.  I only wish that they would put it out in 5.1 surround format.  This is some of the best music from the 70's.  A must have for any audio file.
B000068FWC|1.0|I never received the CD as it was sent to the wrong addy. I'm sure it is spectacular though. I did get my $$ refunded after I e-mailed Amazon to tell them that I didn't get what I ordered, and I have ordered other items which have come to me in a timely manner. Thanks Amazon!! Love ya, T-
1582701709|5.0|I have been working with The Secret for several years now as I am a member of Agape International. But I have never been able to share it like I did at my 50th Birthday dinner party. To set the intention for my life for the next decade, I gave each and every person a copy of \\"The Secret\\". Sense then many many many miracles have happened to many of the people who came to my Birthday. My friends and family love the Secret as much as I do now!!<br />Thank you Secret people, we love you!!!
B0007VZ91C|5.0|This is the best CD to use while doing Reiki. I use it in my Reiki business all the time. She is amazing!!!
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush really branch out in a new direction on this album.  They take many chances, and in my opinion the results are fantastic!  This is by far the most organic Rush album in 25+ years, if not ever.  Alex Lifeson brings the guitar back in a big way with some very fresh riffs and solos, and also an abundance of acoustic guitars.  His style seems fresh and new, and he sounds great.  Geddy tries some new things vocally including some falsetto which surprised me, but it sounds cool!  His bass playing is always great, and the keyboards are all but absent.  Neil is solid behind the kit, and his lyrics continue in the vein of life and travel.  These songs retain some of the new Rush sound, but also sound like some wouldn't be out of place on Caress of Steel, 2112, or even the Witch Hunt side of Moving Pictures.  Overall,  its the most satisfying album I've heard from Rush in many years.  It sounds like they're having fun, and I hope they continue down this new path!
B00008CMR6|5.0|My review title says it all.  I have always loved John Wayne movies.  I have never seen one I have not liked.  Some are better than others, but all are enjoyable.  Rio Lobo is one of my favorite westerns of his.  The great thing about his movies is that I can watch them with my 2 grandsons and do not have to worry about them seeing something inappropriate for their young age unlike movies made today.  We recently purchased a LCD HDTV so we can enjoy them like they were shown in theaters which makes them even more enjoyable to watch.
B00004YA66|5.0|Frequency is a totally different story-line than the usual fair and <br />a much overlooked fantastic movie. It certainly never received the  <br />attention it should have. It is a movie you'll never forget and  <br />definately want to own.  If it seems slow at the beginning, stay  <br />with it -- it gets really dramatic and when you figure out what is  <br />going on, you'll be intriqued. Great Movie!
B000BT97AO|4.0|I took the time to browse through the existing reviews already on-line for the '05 movie `Mirrormask' before composing one of my own, which is something I usually avoid. The reason for doing so was to get a feel for what others think of this surreal, imaginative film and see if my personal rating was going to be in tune with a consensus opinion. However I was to discover a wide and varied spectrum of opinion on this highly original, artsy fantasy film that seemed to be just as enthralling to some as it was immensely boring to others. Isn't that always the way with true art? Oddly enough and impossible though it may be, I fit into both mutually exclusive categories.<br /><br />How is this possible? Well... let me explain. If I'm in the mood for something that is simply meant to entertain, possessing a storyline that will keep my mind focused on the twists and turns of a good plot than this would be a horribly boring movie to sit through. On the other hand, if I'm in the mood for a journey into the inner landscape of dreams to explore vistas and inhabitants so bizarre that they literally become the plot in and of themselves, a place where it's better to remain unfocused on plot development and approach the film as you would Zen meditation then this is the film I would absolutely love.<br /><br />Give 'Mirrormask' a try if you're in the mood something different. All you have to do is become open and receptive to the experience and let the colors, textures and images on the screen take you wherever they are so inclined. After all plot development isn't everything. I guess it's all about your approach. Definitely not a journey that will be enjoyed or appreciated by everyone, but it's a real treat for those that do.
0736063684|5.0|The illustrations in this book are amazing. Each muscle group is drawn to detail in every single illustration so you know exactly which muscles are worked with each exercise. This is useful for athletes, trainers, and pretty much anyone that has interest in exercise or anatomy.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Glad I got it. It was precisely what I thought it would be. Hopefully this documentary will inspire more of us to be more environmentally responsible.
0887431461|4.0|The book is colorful and full of different exercises for kids to practice counting, writing, sorting, analytical skills....my daughter, who just turned five and has attended two years of Pre-K loves the book and will spend 30 minutes completing different exercises. <br /> <br />
6305882592|4.0|I love this story about a guy who has spent most of his life thinking about death until he learns a powerful lesson about life.
B000F6YPOG|5.0|This Album(At the time it was album) this was the freshest sound out there.This was & will be again be played till It's worn it out.I listen to a lot of music, this CD, if it were to come out today, would sell very well, the New generation of music lovers would find it fascinating.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I love this album! It is deep and powerful and hits close to home, buy it you wont regret it. Amazing for a band that has been at this for 32 years, to make a current and relevent recording it is astonishing.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie turned me on to Mozart. Listen to the sound track in surround sound. Really nice.
0790740443|4.0|Great Si-Fi action flick.  This movie will be for all whom love Si-Fi movies and Kurt Russell.  The price was right.
0790733226|5.0|Somewhat believable tale about potential life in the universe. Inspiring and fun to watch.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I am new to the Gilmore Girls and wanted to see how they got to where they were.  The First Season was great and I have also ordered the second season. It helps put it all together. I did not begin watching until last season and did not know how they got there. If you are new to GG, buy the series because it puts all the pieces together.   <br /> <br />I love the show and hope the CW does not discontinue it.
B000005RQT|5.0|There is no words ,35 year of knowing and loving ,steel is my # 1.
B000Q66PXE|1.0|This is the second time I have written a review for this item. I was the first to review this item some time back and it received numerous ratings. All I said was that it would be silly to pay more for the two pack than what they cost seperately. Why would you even market a product like that. I also stated that most HBO series were over priced anyway. Well I guess they didn't like it so here I go again.<br /><br />Rome series 1 and 2 are awesome series. They are in my opinion the best series on HBO. That being said, season 1 and 2 seperately are overpriced. With that being said, why would anyone pay $180.00 dollars for a set of two when you can buy them individually for $45.00 less. It makes no common sense or marketing sense. \\"You can buy either one for $70.00 or I will sell you both for $45.00 more.\\" Yeah HBO that makes a lot of sense.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Anyone who loves Michael Buble or American pop standars will enjoy this CD.  New and interesting work from a vocal master.  The clarity of the sound will have you believing he is singing to you!! <br />
B000FSME1A|4.0|The expanded version is still good but the original is a masterpiece.  What he put back in was stuff that really didnt need to be in there and took your mind off the real story.  The French Plantation scene, the screen with the Playboy Bunnies, Willard stealing Kilgore's surf board and then them hiding from him while he goes looking for it.  None of the was needed and was a distraction in my mind.  The original is one of the best movies ever made, if it ain't broke don't fix it!  The only thing of benefit was the Special Features they added to the CD.  The real annoying part is it is 2 CD's and you have to get up and put in the other CD regardless of what version you are watching.  Don't like Intermissions!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|Norah is always good, but this album isn't up to her previous work. Still, I would buy it again.
B000NA77YO|4.0|I like both Sabbath and Dio but I am not enough of a fanatic fan of either to go out and buy all of their individual CDs. A while back I bought the 2-disc remaster set of the best of Black Sabbath. There's well over 25 songs on that compilation but only two (or three? I can't recall off hand) Dio-era songs and one Ian Gillan tune - the rest is Ozzy. <br /> <br />I caught the Heaven and Hell reunion tour last week because Megadeth was opening. Dio and the guys put on a very impressive show! That's what sparked my interest in this CD. This is a fantastic supplement to an Ozzy-era best of collection. For what it's worth, the three new tracks are good too. <br /> <br />That being said I have never owned Heaven and Hell or Mob Rules so I don't know if I'm missing any essentials but I'm satisfied with this collection as it is. <br />
B000O75F7C|2.0|As a long time dedicated PT fan, I'm always looking forward to the next PT album. Since Signify I know it takes about 10 listen sessions to get caught by the album. Usually the albums grow by each session but this one did not get me the first time and I quitted after the tenth. I miss the empty spacey atmospheres and I miss good songs. The second Blackfield fulfilled expectations, FOABP did not. FOABP, the best selling PT album so far, supplies a lot of riffs and catchy refrains. But this ship does not sail in any direction, it floats but does not reach any harbour. The new fans have a lot of brilliant PT music to discover and I hope SW wil be back on the track with the next PT album. <br />
B000F3TBIO|3.0|I've been a Patton fan since I first heard the self-titled debut of Mr. Bungle, still one of my favorites, but Peeping Tom is one of the weakest projects he's ever been involved in. Patton has been making music like this since the beginning, only this time it's more accessible and has less heart.     A good portion of the songs are worthwhile and catchy but there just isn't much substance here - the songs wear thin fast. The lyrics, though written tongue-in-cheek, are so poor that it truly hinders my enjoyment. I preferred the sound (and lack of lyrics) of the early demos to what we got here.    Still, the music is quirky, fun, and catchy. I just hope that next time we'll get a little more substance with the style.    For other quirky pop/electronica/trip-hop music I'd recommend you check out the following:    - Cornelius  - Vincent & Mr. Green  - Miho Hatori (of Cibo Matto)  - Tujiko Noriko  - Kid Beyond  - Unkle Ho  - CocoRosie
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Arcade Fire's Neon Bible may be the best bible ever written. Each song is of intense lyrical value. Most of the songs are political. There is even a song about Joe Simpson, \\"Antichrist Televison Bules\\", which is awesome. An example of Arcade Fire's amazing lyrical abilities from this song is, \\"...if that little mocking bird don't sing, then daddy won't buy you a diamond ring\\", hilarious. Another example of great lyrics from this album is from the song \\"The Well and The Lighthouse\\", \\"...Heaven is only in my Head\\", LOVE IT.        Neon Bible is also full of great melodies. If you liked the driving bass in \\"Funeral\\" You'll love the melodies in this album. The acoustics are catchy yet inovative. Win, the lead singer, didn't change his vocals, which is good, because as we all know, it's very easy to go \\"comercial\\"   Neon Bible is an amazing cd. My favorite songs are \\"Ocean of Noise\\" and \\"Intevention\\" But I love all of them. Neon Bible is way better than that other bible written by that dead guy.
B000GY729M|5.0|To give the reader a reference to which rock artists I consider to be great, here are some examples: Led Zeppelin, Roxy Music, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Talking Heads, The Clash, REM, U2, Pearl Jam, The Replacements, and Paul Westerberg.(Yep, I'm probably pretty old for a Killers fan; my son turned me on to them, for which i thank him.): This album has very tight musicianship, excellent lyrics and vocals, and sounds just as good each time I put it on. It is filled with fantastic energy and hooks, and many of the songs make me want to turn the volume knob way, way up. When I look at the music that has come out the last 20 years, this album is right near the top.
074356619X|1.0|There's not one thing wrong with \\"The Secret\\" except that it's all been told before, over and over again. If you are new to advice or inspiration books, then this is probably for you. If you've read others, then this is one to skip. Remember this advice? : \\"Anything the mind of man can see and believe, he can achieve\\".  I may not have that quote down perfectly, but that quote or something very close to it has  been credited to so many people, I won't even attempt to put a credit with it here. That's the crux of \\"The Secret\\". see it  in your mind, Believe it, achieve it. The author narrates the CD version, but there's way too much drama in her presentation. Some folks may like that, but it was just way over the top to me.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Though the RPN might take a little bit to get used to, the calculator works great. I was debating between the HP 12C Platinum Anniversary edition and cheaper the TI BA II plus but now I don't regret getting the HP 12C Platinum Anniversary edition. I had read some poor reviews about the HP 12C Platinum but it seems they have worked on the problems in the Anniversary edition. Also, the keys are not flimsy, which was one of the reasons I did not buy the TI BA II plus. <br />I think HP could work on the looks but as long as it works great I am not complaining. <br />
B000HWZ4CA|3.0|I ordered the movie Sgt. York not realizing it was the black and white version. We saw the colorized version on TV and wanted it. It was our mistake by ordering the one advertised and returned it for a refund. We can't find the colorized version but would love to have it. If ever available we want to purchase it. Can you put a request on file? If not, we will continue to search for it. Thank you. Joann Hefner
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie nicks is as classic as apple pie, you just do not get tired of it, whether new or old, everytime you hear her sing, you just can't help but to go back in time, thinking of where you were when the tune first came out, and luckily enought it's always good times, this Stevie nicks new CD truly makes you relive the past with a great big smile.
B000MV9026|5.0|It is a feel good movie for all ages.  The music in it makes you want to dance along with the characters.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I'm very glad to have bought this DVD. This is something that everyone needs to see.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|The wife loves watching the dvd every morning when she gets up. It puts her in a good mood to start the day.
B000002U9W|5.0|Found it strange at first, then fell in love when I keep on listening.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|One of the best Alien invasion action movies, amazing effects, great acting and an awesome story, highly recommended!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie Nicks's new CD is an excellent complilation of songs and I absolutely adore the DVD with all her music videos.  And the best part?  The behind the scenes making of Belladonna.  This sums it all up:  \\"Once in a million years a lady like Her, rises.\\"  Hope you guys and gals enjoy!
B000NA28IE|5.0|This is an excellent movie for all ages.  We are in our seventies and really enjoy it.  We like adventure movies and this is a good example.  The special effects are excellent and the story line is well done.  We would recommend it to anyone.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|The films in itself isn't the best, but her singing simply draws you into the story in such a way that in the end, I cried! snif. Yep, it was gooooooooood. <br /> <br />Go babara!
B000MV9026|5.0|it was very funny and entertaining I like it better than the kids did
B00004I9VE|1.0|This is not a review of the music itself, but just a comment on the SACD version of the album.  I had this album on analog cassette tape way back when, and always wanted a CD version.  When I saw that there was now an SACD encoded version, I immediated added it to my cart, thinking that it may have been re-mixed as multi-channel audio (like Dark Side of the Moon and Brothers in Arms had been).  I guess I should have done my homework, since it wasn't.  This album is in SACD format, but only as 2-channel stereo.  I probably shouldn't have paid extra money to get this.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|I bought this DVD on the day it was released and I must say this is a very extensive and the BEST DVD release ever of Dirty Dancing! I am so glad it is in widescreen and not stupid fullscreen (which is very annoying). You can defenitly tell that the sound has been remastered..I could not believe my ears. And all the special features is mind blowing. Throw away all your other versions of this film as like I said this is the most extensive and best DVD version ever released. The film is presented in a widescreen format of 1.85:1 with tons of new features including all new interviews with Jennifer Grey, writer Eleanor Bergstein, and others. Along with Deleted, Alternate, and Extended Scenes and very funny Gag Reels/Outtakes. Just take my word for it..BUY IT NOW if your a true Dirty fan! I do not think this movie should EVER be released in fullscreen format because if so then it will be taking away some of the picture in the film and the movie would just be terrible if it was in fullscreen as you do not get the full effect of it in fullscreen like you do in widescreen. One word left to say...BUY THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY DVD! You will NOT be disappointed!
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Well... I've been a fan since 1979 and I am a bit down about this one.  The first track is awesome.  Far Cry is the best song for me hands down but ----  what happened on the rest of this one??  I read a lot of reviews hailing this one as there best yet and 5 stars left and right.  I have to disagree and this is why.   Acoustic electric guitar.  Period.  TOO MUCH!  Alex is getting soft from what I'm hearing.  All the bridge sections are weak on almost all the songs as they just drop into some baladish acoustic blandness.  I expect to get some charged roaring guitar and some spirited interplay on the bridge of Rush songs but unless I'm crazy I dont hear it.  I know Rush is always taking a new approach to music and never scared to do something new but this just isnt the Rush I was waiting to here after that first listen to Far Cry.  That song set me up for more of that kind of music and the rest just isnt quite there.  There are some darn good songs but maybe I'm not giving it enough time.   Time will tell I guess.    One more thing - all the songs have a level that doesnt seem to change much.  Drama is falling short here.  The way songs like The Camera Eye used to move through different layers of melody and attack.  Another song they did well was Between the Wheels... there is a dynamic balance missing on this one.  Clarity if you will.   When the guitar does come to the forfront it overdrives the music.  Ah well... I'm sure it will start to grow on me in the end.
B000MV9026|5.0|we loved this movie. we watched it,with our grandchildren, and had to buy some  for our friends grandchildren, too. its a movie for all families, <br />to watch without being embarassed by language, or acts. LOVED IT. <br /> <br />
075640407X|4.0|The writing in this first novel is without many peers in the genre. Of course, that is to be expected from a teacher of writing. The story line, however, is very predictable. Let us hope the sequel brings suprises.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Wonderful cast and spectacular sets.  I am looking forward to attending a live performance and becoming what opera lovers call a \\"Ring Nut.\\"
B000000XB9|5.0|I love ccr so this cd is great! If you are looking for some good music, order this cd and rock out to Green River.
B000NA2776|5.0|Mika's sound is refereshing and exciting....Love it. <br />Fun music.  Great to exercise with too! <br />I was introduced to his music style on the Jay Leno show! <br />I share this with everyone; friends and family. <br /> <br />Thank you!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This  movie was great! Absolutely crazy but awesome at the same time. You have to pay attention to what happens because the plot goes from past to present alot but its a great movie. You'll enjoy.
0618680004|4.0|Richard Dawkins is an excellent writer.  This book is comprehensive, persuasive, and evidence based (or lack thereof).  I'm glad there is someone so articulate and well-informed when it comes to discussing \\"The God Delusion\\".  A well-educated person should have read this book regardless of religious persuasion.    <br /> <br />The author drops the ball only in a couple of chapters at the end (maybe he was tired).  His understanding of biology is limited as evidenced in his discussion of abortion;  he loses his objective touch when discussing that subject.  I think the case for abortion (misnamed \\"choice\\") can be supported on social, economic, and politcal grounds rather than using emotionally distorted biological grounds. <br /> <br />All in all this is a book all serious thinkers should read, especially if they have any desire to explore the subjects of religion and spirituality in humans.  Well done. <br /> <br />JHC
0684830485|5.0|I love this one. Great book. Ive read it 4 times now and each time it gets better and better. You begin to see things you didnt at first and then everything is more clear and its just great. A must have for every book lovers library
0684857219|4.0|It no doubt is a must have for all who are into weight training, not only the ones who are into bodybuilding. I love this book, it tells me precisely what I need when working out in terms of exercise and it's correct technique. All exercises are ridiculously easily described with photographs. I am a beginner and the plan works just fine for me. Its amazing how well- educated our Governor is on the diet aspect for bodybuilders. Must have guys !! Don't think twice.
0062502182|5.0|I think some people truly don't understand this book when they read it, and don't enjoy it. Oh well, to each his own.  <br /> <br />I loved fables as a child, and still have read this books several times as an adult. The lesson the book teaches us is one we already know, and while we think our destiny is before our eyes, there are sometimes more complications to it than that. Life will always take us down another path.  <br /> <br />This is a quick read, a great story. It's a master piece in it's simplicity, not because of character development, etc. It's a wonderful book that I would change nothing about.
0465043577|3.0|Certainly much easier to read then a Financial Analyst's Journal article.  Asks the questions although does not necessarily provide the answers.  A must read for anyone talking to their financial advisors about portfolio construction based on the efficient markets hypothesis.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was the first blu ray disc I purchased for my ps3 and brand new  hdtv, it is simply awesome!  You will not believe how gorgeous the images are, the footage and narration are fascinating to boot.  If you are considering the additional investment required to purchase a blu ray disc, look no further.  I cannot reccomend this highly enough.
0143034901|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  It is an intelligent well written book that should be read at least a second time.  I highly recommend it.
B000NDIAWO|4.0|when this album first came out everyone said that it was complete crap, and that they were disappointed in what Beyonce released this time around. I bought the album because I was curious and wanted to get my own opinions.<br /><br />In agreement with the others this album was definitely different from her last works, and did not follow the same skein that Dangerously in Love did. I will also say that it takes some getting used to at first. But I will not agree with the rest in labelling it as crap. What I see here is Beyonce experimenting with a new sound and recreating herself.<br /><br />\\"Flaws and all\\" is a beautiful song where she talks to her significant other about how she does not feel worthy. In this song she infers to the audience that despite her not being perfect, her significant other still loves her anyway.<br /><br />\\"Get Me Bodied\\" has this sound reminiscent of a New Orleans funeral procession with the blaring trumpets and infectious beat that makes you just wanna get down and jam.<br /><br />\\"Suga Mamma\\" makes you just want to get your own suga baby.<br /><br />All in all a very goo0d work.
B00030590I|5.0|If you haven't watched a lot of chinese epic film this story may confuse you. But the cinamatography is amazing no matter who you are.
B000JRYNXE|4.0|Where this album never followed the classical Gwen that we are used to the different experimentations she did with garage sounding beats were well worth the effort. I highly reccomend purchasing this CD.
0060872675|5.0|If your buying this cause you like discworld, it is a children's book. It's not another \\"the Last Hero\\" so don't be mistaken. It's a great childens book though, and I recommend it on that premise. And if you collect the discworld series.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I've been a hardcore Rush fan for 21 years.  I found my way into the band by way of the bass guitar and for a long time I learned note for note every new Rush song that came out.  I began to think they were losing their touch in 1987 with Hold Your Fire, and for the next several years I saw a pattern that they would put out a good album every other time, it seemed like.  Then they semi-retired in 1998 or so and stuff seemed to get put on hold for awhile.<br /><br />Vapor Trails was an enjoyable comeback but as many people commented the mastering on that album was horrible.  I'm still hoping they re-master it someday without quite so much ridiculous compression and let that music breathe.  But nothing on Vapor Trails compares to this CD.  I've been hooked on it for several days now and I just ordered the MVI version.  I am humming along with all of the songs.  It's a beautiful thing to see one of the best bands of all time get serious about their art and really put the effort into the material.  I just hope I can find my way to a show this time around.  I last saw them in '02.
B000N3AXQU|5.0|Amazing movie for anybody who has not seen it go out and buy it.
0634060384|5.0|This is one of the best books out there.  It has just about every standard (and there's a second book if you cant find the song you want).  Big font, alphabetical order, and a table of contents.  The only annoying thing is that they switch up chord symbols sometimes.  E.g. half-diminished might be written -7 b5 or the \\"o\\" with the slash through it.  Stuff like that-- but i figure it just keeps me on my feet.
B000MQ54OY|4.0|If you like fun family movies, this is a great choice.  It's funny for both kids and adults and has a good message of how we tend to exclude people that are different from us.  The blu-ray version is beautifully crisp,and you can clearly see the hairs on the penguins.  Highly recommended.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|This film is great for the futuristically Sifi inclined watcher however if you have seen the hype of the film you may be let down by this movie.  I would say Give this film a day in court and see what you think of this film, Its one of those that each individual will really like or will really not like. One thing I can promise is that the speciall effects are Phenominal.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|this album reminds me of my childhood.  It is the ultimate Simon and Garfunkle album.
B000HCO840|3.0|Not a bad movie in itself and good for individuals not familiar with the xmen history comic or other, I also found this X men to have a week plot but has a good story line. So would I watch it yes would I buy it again no.
1400063515|5.0|This is one of those books that demands a lot from the reader, but the investment is well worth it.  A background in statistics, at least at the rudimentary level, is almost a prerequisite.  Taleb is a pragmatic, down to earth philosopher and thinker, and each page contains delights and new perspectives.  He writes extraordinarily well and the book contains many laugh-out-loud moments (I particularly enjoyed the description of f.y. money as that sum which enables you to say this a few seconds BEFORE hanging up the phone, rather than a few seconds after!).  The book covers not only statistics and the stock market, with an emphasis on what is called behavioral finance, but also human nature and perception.  Taleb enjoys being a gadfly and on occasion toward the end of the book takes a bit too much delight in his squabbles with others in the field, but overall this is a 10-star book.  I only wish there were more like it published on a regular basis.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|This film is a great Alternative Love story that can touch your heart if your willing to keep an open mind. This film has won several awards, and is well worth the cost of owning it. Not for the close minded or faint of heart. However if you are an open minded hopless romantic then you will love this wonderfull film.
B00005JPFF|4.0|Much-awaited second sequel of \\"Spider-man\\" offers a lot of thrilling action sequences (as you expected), but sadly lacks a coherent story with one (or two, or maybe more) too many characters who should have been kept for another installment of the series. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching \\"Spider-man 3.\\" Yes, I did, but at the same time while watching the film, I was thinking: \\"Did Sam Raimi really need two villains to make this film?\\" Actually I don't think \\"Sandman\\" is really a villain, but anyway, Spider-man has to fight this formidable enemy before fighting another one, more vicious and powerful Venom. <br /> <br />The cast is all excellent, and the action scenes are exciting. The CGI-created Sandman (played by perfect Thomas Haden Church) is simply great, but I still don't know why some characters should re-appear here in this way. It is not a bad idea to show the tragic background story of Sandman and his family, or the estranged relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but the story of vengeful Harry Osborn and short-term memory loss puzzled me, which goes nowhere after all.  <br /> <br />Add to them, there are Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, excellent too), Peter's new friend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father Captain Stacy (James Cromwell). Not only Aunt Parker re-appears to give kindly advice to Peter, but Uncle Parker is also seen again in the flashback scenes, and Bruce Campbell (always welcome) appears again. You need to be a skillful storyteller to handle all these characters, but even Christopher Nolan would find it hard to wrap up all these threads within 140 minute. And don't forget the Venom character which appears too late in the film and lovely Ursula who is totally wasted.  <br /> <br />\\"Spider-man 3\\" has great special effects and great cast, with which they could have made two \\"Spider-man\\" films.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Ok Vampuric Horror fans our Movie has arrived. This film has it all suspense, grate story line and plot, excellent speciall effects, Drama, Suspence and for those that love gothic love stories this one is right up there for you. WearWolf and Vampire Fans a must see as well as the first movie the Sequal lost nothing and was no less impressive then the first.
1571200851|4.0|fun, project.  Instructions are great. though I have yet to figure how to make the sunflower look right.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|one of the greatest dvd i have seen, it really is amazing, the images that will stay with you forever... and in hd-dvd it is just unreal.  Very happy with my purchase, and it will be a collection that will stay with me forever, that can definetely go to other generations.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had watched a number of the Planet Earth episode on my HD TV (65\\") and, like most people, I was blow away. <br /> <br />Thus, when the series was released in a Blu_ray edition I ordered it AND a Blu-ray DVD player. I am not disappointed in the least. What an introduction to full digital viewing! <br /> <br />I contacted NetFlix and was told that, if I registered as having Blu-ray, they would automatically ship me Blu-ray disks when they become available.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I love listening to any of the Celtic woman CD's.. I have all the CD's and keep a watchful eye out for any new ones.My granddaughters enjoy it right along with me.It has a soothing effect on the younger ones and watching them dance with the music is great.. The sounds and tones that come from this amazing group of young talented woman are uplifting and spiritual.. I recommend it to all
1419359827|2.0|So much of what is in here is pretty much the same old, same old. To compound it further, I found the narrator's voice sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring to listen to. Do not waste your money - if I could send it back, I would!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I really enjoy this cd in the car and on a sunny day.  The songs are really fun and Buble sounds a lot like Sinatra.
B000002AH7|5.0|I'm listening to Miles here in Madrid.  We've just done the tapas crawl after seeing a bullfight.  No kidding.  Now, the ipod is playing Sketces....and I've got to tell you that Miles and Gil Evans got it right.  In fact, everything they collaborated on was so fantastic.  And Miles is Miles. Here, a little more sophisticated than in his \\"Kind of Blue\\" phase but, still Miles.  The one and only.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I've been waiting for a John Mayer cd for a while now and I think this one was worth waiting for.  The tracks are meaningful and beautiful.  I'm a long time fan of John Mayer, so maybe I would like anything he put out.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|THE GREATEST - WATCHED IT A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY
B000053V7O|5.0|Buy this movie now !! Dexter is great. Music is awesome. Acting is very real.
1577314808|5.0|I HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, BUT TO DATE, IT IS DEEP AND PRESENTS GREAT CHALLENGES TO THINK AND TO PUT ASIDE WORRIES AND REGRETS, RENDERING PEACEFUL MOMENTS AND THE ABILITY TO CHANGE AND LET GO OF TRIVIAL MATTERS.  RECOMMEND IT.
B00007AJF8|1.0|It's not really THAT original when you look at more independent films, and even originality can't help a boring movie. Not really that funny or entertaining. It feels as if it is trying to hard.
032147404X|5.0|i am a professional photographer and i am not ashamed to say that i learned from this book some really cool stuff, this book is for every one. <br />and it's good fun to read it. <br />i wish that there will be more books like this on the market
0553381350|5.0|As a 'random' book to pick up and read, I was pleasantly surprised at the depth of information provided in this book.  I also enjoyed the writing style.  Excellent excellent, must-read book!
B00005QC4O|5.0|The Music is pretty strong here, with a couple of actual hits (Sugar Magnolia and Truckin') and a bunch of lesser known gems. Lots of acoustic guitars, and probably their best vocals and harmony effort. No \\"Dead space  jams\\" here, the arrangements are quite tight. But the real treat here is the Surround Sound Mix, done by Mickey Hart. His goal was to put the listener in the middle of the band, and he really succeeds. The various instruments and vocals come from specific locations all around you, so that you really experience a 3D sonic image, not just some effects, reverb, or atmospherics from the rear.  <br />The mix also deviates slightly from the original releases on some tracks where additional guitars and vocals that were mixed out of the original release have been added back into the mix, and to my ears generally improve the track. <br />This is definitely the best use of Surround remastering I've heard yet (along with Dark Side Of The Moon), and it was probably the Dead's most accessible and \\"commercial\\" release for the casual Dead fan. A great way to show off your Surround system.
B00003CXDD|5.0|A great movie classic for fantasy and adventure lovers.  Good plot, great acting, and good clean fun!
B000002H97|5.0|It's kind of hip to diss this album to prove that you're a \\"real fan\\", but that's just silly. This is obviously a fantastic rock album as anybody should be able to see. The songs are great, memorable and they rock hard. Even the ballads are awesome. In fact, The Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters are probably my two favorite songs on this album. The Unforgiven is amazing because it sounds Ennio Morricone-inspired and Nothing Else Matters is just a fantastic, heartfelt song. And of course, you have the classic Enter Sandman. I defy anyone to not get the urge to headbang in traffic when this song comes on the radio. If anyone tells you that this ablum is crap, don't listen! Use your ears!
B000NA2776|5.0|I enjoy this upbeat \\"Freddy Mercury\\" type sound. I enjoy every track on this CD
B000001GQQ|5.0|The collaboration between Argerich and Abbado is impressive. Argerich is at her best. A must for your classical collection.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I have always liked Johnny Cash but had none of his CDs. This CD shows the difference between a performer and an artist. This CD is true art. The whole Cd has a very deep message, if you listen and then think of what Johnny is saying. The 1st song \\"The Man Comes Around\\" is maybe the BEST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD, but certainly one of the best.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|One of the reasons why I purchased an HDTV so early was because of Discovery HD.  This series years in the making is a must have for any nature/earth enthusiast.  I know the BBC began filming 5 years ago when 1080p wasn't available yet so it was probably filmed in 720p and mastered in 1080p. <br /> <br />Anyway, this series is fantastic and a must have in either HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.  Sir David Attenborough is a seasoned professional, but I kind of missed the comforting sound of Sigourney Weaver.  After watching both, I must say there's a reason why Attenborough has been doing this for decades.  He's fantastic at what he does. <br /> <br />I tried playing the shows simultaneously while the Discovery Channel played.  It's interesting that Discovery edits bits and parts of the episode to make it somewhat shorter.  Have a map and a metric converter ready because the BBC references Europe frequently and obviously the metric system when making a comparison to the Amazon as an example. :)  The dialog is also different.  The BBC (Attenborough) focuses on the raw review of the footage whereas Discovery (Weaver) constantly mentions how this footage was brought to you never before seen with modern technology. It gets a little old, but I appreciated both perspectives. <br /> <br />With that said, here are my list of very minor issues: <br />- It would be nice to have the option of choosing narrators. <br />- At the end of each Discover episode, there are behind the scenes commentary.  No such commentary on the HD-DVD series. <br /> <br />I'll just want to quickly mention the technology difference when watching this series on Cable or Satellite as opposed to HD-DVD or Blu-Ray.  You get the most from the latter simply because Cable/Satellite providers have limited amount of bandwidth to show all their channels.  Thus, they must make compromises and compress material before showing it to you.  This means the video quality degrades once viewed.  Of course there is compression with HD-DVD/Blu-Ray, but it's not nearly as much.  Yet another reason why this series is a must have!
B0008KLVG4|3.0|The movie is great. The documentary interesting.<br /><br />But we got the 30th anniversary edition and not the cheaper movie or even the 25th anniversary which was on sale in other places for less than $10 because of the commemorative photo journal. Well it came without it.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they were really good and sent me another copy; THE NEW CAME WITHOUT BOOKLET EITHER!<br /><br />IF LIKE US YOU WANTED THIS EDITION IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA BOOK BEWARE.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Another Pedro Almodovar masterpiece! It was moving, strong, beautiful. He weaves a woman's story so well...
B000E41MS6|5.0|This is great science fiction, great human storytelling, great acting....  Christopher Eccleston is such an excellent actor, it's sad this is his only Dr. Who season.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush's best since Hold Your Fire. If you are a diehard like me you will absolutely love this album.
B000GPIPTW|5.0|Please see producer Mark Linett's review under the deluxe \\"fuzzy\\" version of this new CD/DVD. The mono version of the album has been remastered from a superior source to that used in 2000, and a more complete version of \\"Hang On To Your Ego\\" has been used.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|This movie keeps you on your toes, very exciting and entertaining, not a dull moment, just great.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|While I found it very consuming I also found that I too have been guilty of contributing in so many ways . For one, I am so sorry that I did not follow through with the same \\"green\\" ideas that I grew up with. Second, while it may have been impossible for Mr. Gore to accomplish much in the White House in this truth, I feel that he would have given it a great try, although the American Congress ( I am a registered voter) is blind to these truths while the rest of the world is most accepting.  That in itself is a sad testimony of our people that we vote into office.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|I have the whole series of the Star Wars movies and I do enjoy watching them often.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|A fabulous review of WW II through the eyes of the British. Complements the \\"Vistory at Sea\\" series.
B000MV9026|2.0|This picture was cute with the animation, but was much too slow in developing the story plot. Interest was lost in a number of places, although the over all idea was good.
B000NA28IE|4.0|Thought the movie was pretty good. It's very family friendly movie,I especially liked the dragon.excellent animation.
0385336942|4.0|I'm not finish readding yet. <br />I give 4 stars which I have read a half of book.
0792164903|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas in 2006.  We all watched it that day, and it was pretty good.  The shipping was very quick.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I know I could get plenty of arguments about this, but I feel this is Kidman's best performance on film. She holds her own, and excels, in very distinguished company.  <br />It's long.....but intense enough to prevent boredom.  It is also quite a disturbing film.  So pick a time when you have a few hours to spare to watch it right through, and then some time to digest the fare.  <br />
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I remember viewing this movie back in the 80's. The movie still scares me today. With all the wars and fighting going on. World War 3 is still a high possibility. Nobody is ready, not even myself. This movie is a must see for everyone. A Very realistic Nucular War movie.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This CD is kind of like her first one.. Full of energy and different kinds of feelings to each song! I LOVE IT!!!
B000AOEMXM|3.0|I was not pleased that the first disk contained several commercials, even before you were able to get to the Enterprise content.  Most annoying.  The series was great, and shouldn't have gone off the air.  For me, this collection was a chance to see all the episodes that I hadn't seen.  It was like having the series in new release again.  The most disappointing part of this collection as purchased from Amazon was the fact that all the so-called, \\"Extra Features\\" were not viewable, for some technical reason.  You only get to \\"see\\" pixels of the features.  This was true of not only this \\"Complete Seasons 1-4\\" of Enterprise, but of all the complete seasons of all the Star Trek series I've purchased from Amazon.  They bait and switch you.  They say they've never been used, or are original product from the manufacturer.  Which may be true, but these DVDs certainly are not error free.  I was very dissappointed.  I would not recommend buying any DVDs from Amazon.  Look elsewhere.
0783231032|5.0|Very pleased with the condition of the dvd and the timeframe that the dvd was received. <br />Thanks
B000LPS47U|4.0|Awesome release, interesting bonus matherials and nice marker inside. Bravo, Anchor Bay!
1400079276|3.0|This is my first encounter with Haruki  Murakami-a popular writer of many bestselling \\"page turners\\"  where facts and fiction skilfully intermingle <br />.I like the imaginary world of Chagall or Gabriel Garcia Marquez ,but Kafka on the shore ,even if entertaining , disappointed me.The plot and the characters have  to be believable  even in the supernatural world, and here the  vagaries of the plot and the wild actions of the protagonists  peppered with unnecessary pornography (yes,not eroticism) turned me off ,but I can think of many readers who will   find   the swift action and the wild imagination of the author quite  enjoyable . I may   even try another sample of Murakami on a long airplane trip.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|These ladies can really sing! Perhaps the best of all the Celtic Women choices out there.
B000059T00|5.0|It was a superband that had it all, and it is a delight to tool down the highway to these tunes.  Each song on this \\"album\\" is a gem.
B00005JPD0|2.0|Okay, look, I agree if you stick it through \\"everything does pull together\\" in the end and there is the usual fine and polished acting from Denzel, but did anyone really believe the time travel?  You know, the part where Denzel, whom I respect so much, was sitting in what looked like a sewer pipe with a oversized torpedo hatch-like door waiting to go be bop back in time.  I'm all about cashing in my suspension of disbelief at the movies, but this bending time rubbish was handed to the audience like it was no big deal.  Like, hello, doesn't all law enforcement bend time via their uber-secret projects when needed to solve terrible crimes?  Overall not my cup of tea, extra star for Denzel 'cause I like him.  I'd guess others will like this movie better, because it's really not terribly crafted overall, if they're will to buy the comic book parts of the story line.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is without a doubt the very best movie we have seen in the last 20 years!
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Now I understand why this movies recieve an Oscar for best animation, it's realy funny and the message of the story is realy important and true.<br /><br />A pure HD moment!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This is a great buy - the CD is fantastic and it was very interesting to <br />read the enclosed booklet and hear all Stevie's personal comments about each <br />song and what inspired her to write or record these particular songs.  The <br />DVD is great.  She looks good now and then.  This is a good buy and you <br />should definitely get one.  I purchased one for me and then another one as a <br />gift for my sister.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Just Perfect!<br /><br />Amazing pictures, best sound, best action, name: Ray....Blu-Ray!<br /><br />I think Blu-ray it's the best technolgic product ever made in audio & Video!
B00006F7IM|5.0|The movie arrived on time and in great condition.  One of my favorite sports movies, and happy to add it to my collection.
B000MV8ABS|4.0|This book is a mixture of interviews and an overview of Mr. Lynch's career. I'll be the first to admit that he's not the best at interviews. He gives none of the magic of hios movies away. Which I for one think is a good thing. <br />Out of all the books on the subject, this is the best.
B000NA28HU|5.0|An action fantasy that teaches.  One should never give up your dreams because you failed one time.  Support and love from family and friends is what this movie is about, and the trust of animals in good humans.  I just love this movie.
032147404X|5.0|All the terms are made easy to understand.   <br />Pictures help with explanations.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I've always been fan of the Alien series and I wanted to have them all in one package, and this set box is great. The 9 discs are worth the price and you can get to see other versions not previously seen, which are excellent and give you a different perspective. Only the first one has no major changes, maybe a few extended scenes, but the rest of them are amazing! My favorite so far is \\"Alien Resurrection\\", when we get to see a glimpse of earth after soooo many years and Ripley is finally home. Get it ONLY if you're a true fan, otherwise...
0307237699|5.0|Barack Obama does a wonderful job of expressing his values and beliefs in this book.  The book is not only well-written and insightful but also a breath of fresh air.  While we don't know yet if Obama will be the Democratic nominee for President, this book provides good reference material if you are pondering who to vote for in the next election...
B000N3ST8O|5.0|of course this Stevie Nicks cd is great, all of her music is. I bought this cd/dvd set mainly for the dvd. Its great to havre Stevie's videos finally. It took her long enough. now if we could just get Itunes to sell some of those videos...
B000JLQQ12|1.0|This is no different that Biggie \\"Biggie Duets\\". All it is is old material a capella, re-worked with new instrumentals, new names and new recordings by musicians who are still living. Then they are attempted to be passed off as a new song. That is not right. Just let Pac RIP
0767802659|4.0|Starship Troopers gets no \\"respect\\" from serious sci-fi fans because of its paint-by-the-numbers characteristics.  But, it's a rollicking, 1950's war movie right up there with the best ones by Cary Grant, John Wayne, Richard Widmark, and dozens of other actors who starred in Hollywood's re-telling of WWII.  A British captain guides his capital starship, survivor of a dastardly sneak attack, on a hopeless quest to warn Earth of impending Doom and Destruction.  And, you guessed it, a gifted young pilot volunteers to fight his way through hostile hyperspace.  Will he make it in time?  It's rock'em, sock'em, Saturday serial adventure! If you liked B-grade war movies when you were a kid, you'll love this one!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Know how some of your favorite bands seem to get a little less great over time, until eventually you stop picking up their weak albums?  Well, Incubus has broken the mold because their newest album, \\"Light Grenades,\\" is actually much stronger than the past two.  While I would give \\"Morning View\\" a 4/5 and \\"Crow Left of the Murder\\" a 3/5, I give \\"Light Grenades\\" a 5/5 for sure.  Every song on the record is a slam dunk, seriously.  BUT if buy this CD thinking it's full of crunchy guitar riffs and expecting to rock out, you might want to preview the songs first.  This is a melodious and beautiful rock album but it's nothing to mosh to.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Being a big fan of all the Rocky films (apart from Rocky V which I was a bit disappointed about) I thought this wouldn't come near the other four but it turned out to be a fitting end to the series.  Rocky Balboa proved to be my second favourite of all the films (Rocky IV being the best).  It opens with Rocky running his wife's restaurant Adrian's after her death from cancer, the customers attracted by hearing his reminiscences about past glory. <br />Of course Rocky isn't satisfied with the quiet life and when the opportunity arises to box again he grabs it with both hands. <br />The film is well acted and even though Sylvester Stallone is in his sixties he puts in a convincing performance as the veteran boxer.  If you enjoyed the earlier Rocky films you'll love this one.    <br />
0060012234|5.0|This book is truly one of the best books that I've ever read. <br /> <br />With that said, I'll say that the book seems geared towards young adults but I'm 25 and I can still relate to the book.  This book actually brought forth a lot of emotion within me - especially since I've dealt with many of the issues that this book deals with.  There were points throughout the book where I found myself actually holding my breath and reliving part of past experiences because all of it was so real.  Brent is an amazing author with a mastery of words and a rare talent for imagery.  I absolutely respect him for what he has done with this moving story that truly is a part of all of us whether we're gay, straight or otherwise.
0440234743|3.0|This book surprised me in that there were many slow parts.  I like John Grisham but this story was lacking.  It went on too long in some areas and made me want to skip to the end.
0972169504|1.0|Not funny.  It goes in the trash so no one else has <br />to read it.
B00005JPCF|4.0|This is the feel good movie of the decade. Not that this is the best movie you'll see in the next 10 years but this movie delivers solidly on its promise. For anyone who has not lost all of the child in them, Happy Feet brightens your day, lifts your mood, and makes the world, for a short period of time, seem like a happier place to be. The animation is stunning when it has to be. The music is nostalgic and yet the arrangements are fresh and certainly appropriate for the message the music needs to deliver. Happy Feet is not great drama,but it is an emotional tour de force sweeping the viewer away in possibilities. I doubt anyone can see Happy Feet and not be uplifted. I know I have been each time I've seen it.
1582701709|5.0|To whom it may concern, <br /> <br />First of all, thank you for your prompt response with the order.  I was highly delighted to have received the book so quickly. <br /> <br />Regards to the contents I would recomment it to anybody who wants a greater inner understanding on the mysteries of life. <br /> <br />For those who have no hope this book will undouptedly inspire and show the way to achieve their desires and fulfilment.  For anybody who wants to be empowered this is the knowledge that will free mankind from any cultural hypnosis or mind-set, be it religious, political or any type of dogmatic belief. <br /> <br />Many thanks, <br /> <br />John.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|Fantastic Bond adventure. I am a fan of Pierce Brosnon, but the Bond franchise was starting to tip into the unbelievable as far as the special effects went. This entry into the Bond franchise rights a ship that was beginning to list. I am already looking forward to Craig's next performance as James Bond.
074356619X|5.0|Really enjoyed this great audio book. It is well produced. I have listened to it three times. I highly recommend it for everyone that wants to learn \\"The Secret\\" even if you have seen the movie and read the book like I have.
B00005JPFH|1.0|Spend your money on Spiderman part 2 dvd, its much better!     Spiderman 3 is total garbage. It does NOT follow the comic book, or the animated series storyline.     The storyline for this movie is very poor quality, and there are plots twists that will make you want to punch the writers.
B000002LEU|3.0|We really can't compare Joy Division to bands like New Order... they are very different. New Order is mostly synthesized, whereas this is very raw guitar, plus a lot darker. They are known as being influencial to the punk rock industry, paving the way for bands like The Cure. <br /> <br />This isn't my favorite album or band by far, but at the very least should be appreciated. <br /> <br />I wish the sound quality wasn't so poor, though. Makes the album a little difficult to jam to. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000IFQLLY|5.0|What i have to say about Depeche Mode.. <br />Only that its awesome!!!  <br /> <br />They've sold over 13million copies of their albums!!  <br />Anyways.. i think this truly does bring out the best of Depeche Mode if u've never heard of them before..
0439813786|5.0|My intention was to give the book a cursory overview to assure its suitability  for Garrison. Instead, I became engrossed in the story.  It's delightful, and I know Garrison will enjoy his birthday present.  Thank you.
0385512058|4.0|In a way that might result surprising for a European mindset (perhaps too direct?), Ferrazzi details his networking strategy and methodology. I enjoyed it a lot and have given it to several friends.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|If you are a fan of the original Star Trek series like I am, then this is the ultimate gift for you.  Since receiving this gift over a month ago, a night does not go by without my watching an episode or two.  Nothing has or will ever replace the original series and cast members of Star Trek. It still amazes me how much the show still appeals to people young and old.  It is certainly better than many of the current shows we're getting on television these days.
0312330529|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  The insight into life in India is astounding.  The author's self-analysis is brilliant.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE JUST LOVES THE MOVIE.
B00006LLNU|4.0|The first half of this two part album is really very good, although the lyrics, which are in the made up language of \\"Hopelandic\\", seem a bit repetitive.  The album seem to fade for the next three tunes before the band re-emerges for another honest go of it in the in eighth and final track.   <br /> <br />Definitely worth owning if your are a Sigur Ros fan, but not as good as Takk or AEgitis Byrjun
B000002O59|4.0|Just about all the other reviewers have summed up this gem of a soundtrack.  It's great for parties, it's great for driving, it's fun. <br /> <br />There's only one major problem I have with it.  That's the fact that it's just not complete.   <br /> <br />The main track that's instantly missing is \\"OH YEAH\\", by the band 'YELLO'.  Also 'Walking On Sunshine' should deffinatley be on there also. <br /> <br />I purchased this album from Amazon a while ago and feel it's high time there was a re-released special edition containing all the missing tracks, especially 'Oh Yeah' as that's the first song that comes to my head when I think of the movie full stop. <br /> <br />Here's hoping it's re-released without the mistakes of the new Top Gun soundtrack. <br /> <br />Sean.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Usually you buy a CD and only like one or two songs on it. I love them all. I saw these two perform on MHD(MTVHD)and was blown away. Always have loved Emmylou Harris but these together make some very pretty music. Thanks you two.
B000MXPE7O|1.0|This was a very disappointing movie given a wonderful cast. Robert DeNiro should stick to acting. The direction of this film was horrible. It lacked pace. What pace it had was slow and turgid. No wonder it did not last in the theatres. If you buy this DVD as I did because you love the genre and the cast you are in for a bad experience.
0060920432|5.0|Though I recently bought a 1990 edition of this book it still is quite relevant to this day. A well researched book which really makes one aware about how one can enhance the quality of one's own life. A must read for all those who are in purusit of happiness and beyond. I have been through what Mihaly describes as the state of 'FLOW' many times before. In fact at the time I was reading 'FLOW' and even at this very moment as I am writing these lines of this review I am experiencing 'FLOW' and the book apart from resonating that feeling has provided me with the awareness of ways of sustaining this state longer and has taught me how to bring this state about more often and perhaps in due course at will.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|You can't fault Pierce Brosnan. It's not his fault the writing for the previous Bond era (1995 - 2002) was silly. In fact, the audience had been dumbed down so much that when you caught a glimpse of originality and intrigue in the torture sequences of Die Another Day, we took that and ran with it, even past the idea of a villian wanting to use a laser beam to detonate the landmines between North and South Korea. <br /> <br />Once you see Casino Royale, you are slapped awake from your lethargy,  saying \\"What exactly was that nonsense from the last ten years?\\". <br /> <br />Daniel Craig is my 2nd favorite Bond (Connery still on top, and likely to stay since he was the first). He looks like someone who would sleep with a girl, and then kill her afterwards if the mission required it. He isn't a pretty boy, just Agent 007 looking to serve the queen. He looks weathered, and plausible as a secret agent. That realism and danger brings the necessary depth to a Bond film, because that is what makes this character and his world so intriguing: the smoke-filled Baccarat tables lined with used poker chips and pungent alcohol, settled with sharp black suits and form-fitting dresses. This is Bond's world, and that is why people watch. <br /> <br />I like the villain, and the fact that he too had weaknesses and was not all-knowing. I liked how they dealt with his character, and how it changes the arena of the film. I like that Bond lost. I like that Bond lost (bears repeating). I like him coming into his own. I like Bond saying \\"The bitch is dead.\\", and I like that famous introduction once he becomes James Bond. <br /> <br />My only hope is that they continue what they started with this film. I don't want to see invisible cars, laser-guided cigars, At least for the Craig era. <br /> <br />Negatives? Bond driving that car before the Aston Martin. I accepted it, but it really is a blot on the character. Also, Bond should be smoking a cigar. I don't care if a kid gets the wrong idea, he should have enough life experiences to tell him otherwise. Bond smokes, and should have. It feels like a neutered version, but it's something to consider later. In the next movie, just have Bond light a cigar in economical movements, and blow a big puff of dirty gray into the MPAA. <br /> <br />Stuff like that gives this film a 4 star rating, though it was close to a 5. Close enough, but no cigar.
0684135051|5.0|As you can deduce inmediately, english is not my mother tongue. EZ's \\"Knitting without tears\\" is THE knitting book for beginners or for experts. I've been knitting for more than 30 years and I learned many tips and hints from Elizabeth Zimmermann's \\"Knitting without tears\\". Something really important about this book is that we can enjoy knitting with no stress, we can be creative with no fear, and most of all, from the basics to the most elaborated you can face yarn and needles with confidence because everything is in those pages: how to start, how to solve problems, how to knit for YOU (every body is different), how to finish as a pro...<br /><br />If I ever have to chose only one book to teach or to learn knitting, \\"Knitting without tears\\" is, by far, THE ONE (even for someone that doesn't speak english like me!)<br /><br />One more thing: once I had this book in my hands, I order all the other books and videos by EZ!!!
B000EGCITG|5.0|This CD has not left my car CD player since I put it in a month ago.  Outstanding range of material.  All of it was executed with energy and punch.  Love this CD.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|What a phenominal movie!  Ryan Gossling's portrayal of a caring but conflicted/addicted teacher was the best acting showcase I have seen in years.  While Forrest Whitaker was great in \\"The Last King Of Scotland,\\" he should have won for supporting actor.  Ryan actually made me believe that he was a crack addict who cared he was so good in this flick & should have won the Oscar for Best Actor.  And don't get me started on Shareeka Epps.  How she didn't even get nominated for supporting actress is a mystery to me.  Overall, a devastating movie with some of the best acting you will see in this year or any other.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|If this will be your first time buying The Downward Spiral, I would recommend buying this Dual Disc edition.  It includes videos for \\"Closer\\" and \\"March of the Pigs.\\"  The videos are of pretty good quality.  I would guess they are near or matching DVD quality, but I'm not sure of the resolution.  The option to listen to the album mixed in 5.1 is also great.  Since the disc also plays in standard CD players for a stereo mix of the tracks, you can use it just like a regular CD if you want.  If you're buying this just for the surround sound, I'd recommend getting the Deluxe Edition of the album, which is a SACD and includes an album of b-sides, most of which are mixes collected for the singles that accompanied the release of TDS.  Or, if you're like me and just have to have ever NIN release there is, this is a great addition to the collection because you get the videos.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is a Wonderful classic that will never be matched.  <br />Disney has never been as well done since these earlier classics.  <br />They are truly the Best.
1582701709|5.0|I love the inspiration that this book provides.  I read this book in just 2 days and I loved it.  Not really a secret but a good compilation of wisdom, beliefs and faith.  Well worth reading.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Bought this as a gift off of a wish list.  The person and their family really enjoy the movie
0321344758|5.0|Desiging an interface is easy. Desiging a *good* interface is hard. This book helps the user identify what good design looks like, and why different elements are on a page. Many sites, amazon included, use Tabs as a navigational element. Breadcrumb trails identify where you are within a site, which is similar to how signs identify your location at Lowes, Sears, or some other mega-mart.
630522577X|5.0|I personally like classic movies compared to some of the movies out there now.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie has an awesome plot. How often do we see a movie from almost a hitman's perspective? The gun fighting and hand-to hand combat is pretty realistic. Tom Cruise does look like he knows what he is doing with his USP .45 ACP.  Jamie Fox should probably be dead the way they both were shooting, but otherwise great movie. I like the views of LA and the whole town not just the part everyone sees. You can tell the director knew LA. Yes, I have been to LA use to live in CA. Plus the music made this just as much as anything, Air in G in the cab, and the Korean Club music were awesome adding to the mood. This a great movie with a different plot. Warning: may make you almost like Tom Cruise again!!!!
1577314808|2.0|An old French Quarter come on by the local kids was to tell a tourist, \\"I bet you $5 I can tell you where you got them shoes.\\"  If the tourist bit, the kid said, \\"You got them on your feet.\\"  Kids made a few bucks, everyone got a laugh.  Now, on a takeoff of that sucker punch, I bet $5 I can tell Eckhart where he got his spiel. He got it from Krishnamurti, and put it in his books. Having said that, he at least gets it right, and he serves it in a digestible form, so more \\"power\\" to him. Anything that encourages people to quit looking around for gurus and attempts to get them to understand the simple fact that this is a journey you have to take yourself, not through the formulas and methods of another, is worth a go.   Be forewarned, you aren't entering a 12 step program to awareness, you are going to have to strip away all your crutches, supports, opinions and biases. You might take on J. Krishnamurti as well, but forget it if you just want some touchy feely navel gazing baby food.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|This is a movie of a bygone era. Today the plots are all either paper thin or incredibly complex, but they give you enough clues to figure it out. This movie is so complex and has so many twists it is awesome but you might don't feel like it is handed to you. This is a product of a bygone era and the car chases are the best since bullet. Realistic yes, the stunt drivers knew their stuff and they performed excellently. The shooting is done quite realistically, and the guns are interesting and exotic (foreign) as well. It is cool too, to see Europe but a different view than most, we see some of the slums and regular parts of Europe. All-in all this is an amazing movie with a great plot, great acting, and great action. This is not for the casual Hollywood inaccurate action/suspense flick guy. Well, this is for everyone; but those who know stuff about guns won't be disappointed because there are no inaccuracies. Those disappointed by the surreal car crashes in Hollywood, will find solace here, with three realistic ones. Those that hate the paper thin plots will feel alive with this movie. Two-huge thumbs up!
B000GIXEIG|3.0|I was disappointed in the film.  Somehow, it just didn't grab my attention the way I had hoped it would.  All the elements were there -- I enjoyed the actors performances, the retelling of the story, the film itself, but it just didn't meld compelligly to me.  However, the scenery was astonishing and beautifully eerie, and I found the commentary much more interesting than the film itself. <br /> <br />Therefore, I would recommend the commentary as the Making of the Film, is more interesting than the film iteself.
1400064287|5.0|I immediately used the SUCCESs concepts in my classroom...Right after I read the book, a student challenged me to explain why he needs to learn accounting...I had the best answer thanks to this book...This book has changed the way I teach...
B000003CM8|5.0|A great debut by the Allman Brothers Band. Though they would make even greater music, with Duane's guidance, this album still stands the test of time.
B0000252YK|5.0|Against some popular opinion, I have always thought it was one of his best albums.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Sit down on a rainy Sunday afternoon with a bag of popcorn, pop in Willow and you will spend two very enjoyable hours with your family.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|Así como todas las obras de Almodóvar, ésta es excepcional. El libreto, su dirección, la puesta en escena, los personajes y la actuación de un elenco estelar constituyen una de las mejores películas de los últimos tiempos.
B000NA2776|5.0|While I haven't heard a lot of Mika before this album, it is an amazing CD. His songs are extremely catchy and I love listening to it on the bus or on the way to work. There are a few slow songs that seem a bit out of place but still a great piece of work. Well worth every penny!
B000M343BM|5.0|I already knew the movie, but never had it on DVD. <br />Excellent service, ease of order, and delivery.
0553213105|4.0|I was surprised by how much i liked this book. Jane Austen's style is very original in its own way. Although it's way too gossipy and cheesy, the story was well thought out
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is an ok CD to have. I only like about 3 songs on it.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We were introduced to Blokus by our grandsons in the travel version on a family ski trip to Aspen.  As soon as we got home we bought both full size versions and have been playing it since.  It's become our new home entertainment after-dinner activity (substituting for Scrabble) that our guests are now REQUESTING.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is probably the BEST voice I have heard in a long time. You can feel the songs that he sings. I recommend this CD to everyone; because this is the way music should be.
B000HKCRW2|4.0|much more upbeat and listenable than \\"echoes\\" despite the prior album's great singles.  this album is less schizo than echoes yet has the same vibe.  great to play loud in a car.
0634022296|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  I purchased it with the complete scores book and have found that I predominantly use this one, since it is less bulky and contains all the tunes.  Although the recommended chord shapes are a bit 'dumbed down' and certainly not the ones used by the group, it is a nice feature. <br /> <br />Also, you sort of have to bend the spine a bit, so that the thing will stay open when you play, but since the price is so low, there's no desire to 'baby' it.  Bravo!
B000M3452Y|5.0|just what one wants and needs from lcd soundsystem.  totaly addictive.  best songs:  North American Scum, Get Innocuous, All my Friends.  acutually they are all the best.  i just really like this CD.  Similiar to the debut, but with better songs.
1400064287|5.0|About a year ago, I gave a project proposal at work for some of the higher-ups in our company.  I'd tried, as I always do, really hard to do the best I could.  Later, my boss raked me over the coals, saying that the higher-ups had remarked to her that it was one of the worst such presentations they'd seen.  My idea had died, hard.  I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident, but my whole life has been like this, although fortunately not with as dire consequences as this time.  I just can't seem to persuade people. <br /> <br />A few months ago I saw a notice about a book talk by Chip and Dan Heath.  I'd never heard of them, but the title of their book grabbed my attention.  It offered a possibility, that maybe these guys had a solution to my problem.  I don't usually attend these self-promotional book talk lectures--after all, they just want to sell me a book, right--but that subtitle just wouldn't let me go.  I was sick and tired of my ideas dying.  So I went to the talk, all the while thinking \\"this is probably going to be a big waste of time.\\" <br /> <br />Rarely have I been so happy to be wrong.  What Chip and Dan laid out for me in the 45 minutes or so that they spoke was nothing short of revolutionary for me.  They laid out a set of simple, concrete principles that explain why some ideas soar like eagles, while mine flop like turkeys.  I bought the book.  I read it and found it to be fun, easy reading, packed with wonderful, engaging examples.  It wasn't at all the sort of dry, academic material I'd expect from a couple of university professors.  They had clearly taken their own advice to heart, and it shows. <br /> <br />And the next time I have to give a presentation at work or anywhere else, my ideas won't just survive, they'll thrive.  Thank you, Chip and Dan!
B000001EYW|5.0|This is a really great CD. I have 2 copies; one for my car & one for home. After all the years I've listened to their music, I love getting these less popular (in the U.S.) albums. I'm hearing songs for the first time because they were just nominal hits's in the U.S. If you love the Bee Gees, buy this one too.
074356619X|5.0|This item is so extremely well done, and the content so pertinent to improving one's life, that I keep it in my car and listen to it over and over repeatedly.  Each new listening reveals new insights that I had previously missed due to focusing on another great idea posed in the material.  It proves to be fantastic as regular daily motivation!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Much better than built-in flash on my D70. Can direct upwards for even lighting.  Compact and light. And a bargain.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Unfortunately Depeche continues to do their best work when fueled by life's darker and edgier concerns... personally, it's a love/hate aspect of one of my favorite alternative bands. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm unimpressed by Gahan's (and collaborators) lyrical contributions though his singing is as strong and emotionally packed as ever.  In conjuctions with, Gore's edgy lyrics, the two define what Depech Mode is.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|As an adventure movie it is great but as a James Bond movie it just does not make it. James Bond was supposed to be a suave sophisticated upper class spy. Daniel Craig comes across as a yobbo just off the fish cart and jammed into a suit.<br /><br />Sure he looks pretty and there is all the car scenes and the shoot them up, beat them up bits, but he just does not fit the image regardless of the hair colour. And what happened with the card game scene, firstly we have draw poker instead of chemin de fer, a traditional casino card game similar to Blackjack and then in the middle of the game the continuity gets messed up. Were we considered too stupid to understand chemin de fer ?<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film, so much for that.
078628952X|5.0|I believe this is one of the most important books of our times.  Obesity, dieasese related illness and a host of other problems can all be traced back to the change in farming techniques and food BUYING practices as well as our eating habits.  If we are to improve our health, cut health care costs and save our planet from further environmental decay in the process we MUST change the way we grow our food and what we eat. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is even mildly interested in any of the issues I have touched upon.
0575077859|3.0|There's been quite a bit of hype for this book on the internet in the fantasy circles, and I was expecting something as fun as Scott Lynch's \\"Lies of Lock Lamora\\". But that's not the case here. It's accessable and a fairly entertaining read, but it does read like a portion of one book, ie story lines are left hanging, with a let down of a climax. Ordered this as an import, but don't think I'll be buying the rest of the series.
074356619X|1.0|A friend of mine started reading it and thought I might like it.  There is nothing new in the book, I've done most of it all just by common sense since I was a senior in high school (I'm 64 now).   Content was a total waste of time - good thing I purchased the CD so I could listen to it and not waste even more time reading it.  Now for those of you that have no common sense, it might be worth your time.
B00000I8BX|4.0|not the best ff album ever, however certainly not the worst. you cant be a ff fan without owning this album.
B000HVHM5S|5.0|Excellent movie. Acting performances are some of the best you will ever see. Natalie Portman is fantastic as well as Hugo Weaving. Great choice for your DVD collection.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|After I bought my first HP12 more than 20 years ago (it still works), I thought I'd never change it. However, the Platinum edition brought add-ons really worth having. The Hp12 is a product so well designed that few products have or will have the live span it has experienced. I bought the Platinum HP12 but will stii carry and use my old HP.
1582701709|5.0|this is a Must Read for ALL.... <br />Excellent , Easy Read. <br />Something we as Humans should follow in our every day lives for all Eternity.
B000002IZM|5.0|I have been looking for the original soundtrack to Blade Runner for years,I even recorded the love theme from the movie I had on tape. I was sure thrilled to see it was available on CD years later. The \\"Love Theme\\" is my favorite. \\"Rachel's Song\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" are my next two favorites. The tape recorded version was very hissy and full of noises, but the CD is so crystal clear, and an extended version of total perfection. Vangelis is great, and this CD is a masterpiece.
B000MV9026|5.0|My grandchildren and I watched this movie I think 12 times.  They loved it and giggled and danced.  My 10 year old grandson still watches it over and over when he comes to visit.   I would like to point out that watching TV at granny's is very limited but the exception to the rule was made after seeing them enjoy this so much.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is truly a wonderful dvd and seeing it in hd is fantastic. It is like watching the world through your window. It makes you appreciate the world we live in and it will show you that it is worth saving.
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie is phenominal. The story, music, and cinematography are all amazing. If you love medeival times, this is a great pick. It is gorry, but it represents war in that day very well.
B00007KQA3|5.0|This is an amazing movie, and the thing that is really unfortunate is that these sellers are gouging the prices and keeping this movie's important message from the rest of the world. Despite this movie being out of print, it is ENTIRELY available through the United Kingdom AMAZON and you can purchase it regardless of where you are. I just bought mine for 7 dollars and with shipping it totalled 11 DOLLARS and 54 CENTS!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING FROM THESE SELLERS! They are turning a profit on George Orwells work and keeping 1984's crucial message from the average viewer. Like I said before, they should be ASHAMED of themselves. Great, great movie and everyone needs to see. Once having the opportunity to watch, I highly recommend looking into todays politics and seeing how it relates to much of what is going on today (ie patriot act and the almost patriot act II) Very eerie. Nonetheless, everyone must also check out 1984LIVE dot com. It is mildly humerous yet at the same time daunting. REMEMBER, SHOP UK AMAZON and dont get sucked into buying from these money-hungry sellers in the United States.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|i <br />I LOVE THE MOVIE!!!!! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT PURCHASE, COULDN'T BE HAPPIER!!!!!
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|This movie was really a complete mind blowing experience.  It should be the poster movie of why not to do herion.  Showing what addiction to anything can do and what it will bring you to.  Somewhat a love story and very sad for all the characters involed.
0671799320|5.0|Outstanding history of oil politics, economics and foreign relations. Even though this book was published in 1991 the information is not stale and the information on Sunni and Shia conflicts were well known when this book was written. Yergen who is also the author of \\"Commanding Heights\\" the proclaimed PBS documentary is an excellent writer. Althought I came late to the table to read this book it is still as valuable today as it was when first published. If you are interested in oil and oil policy this is a must read.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Certainly the best series of all time.  The Godfather Trilogy is the defining movie of the 20th Century
B00008BRB5|5.0|Love this CD. Needed it for my collection of albums turning CD.
B000IHY9UW|5.0|This movie transported me back to the 60's. It brought back some great memories. The sound track is excellent!!!!!
0385512104|5.0|A wonderful book.  The debate about this being a child with asperger's or autism needs to be considered second to the fact that this book serves a greater purpose.  Mental illness/disabilities are so misunderstood and this book serves to help educate the reader about the different ways people view the world.  If you are an educator and reading this review please read this book and then add it to your students reading list.  After that invite a local psychiatrist or psychologist to talk with your students about mental illness.
B00005JPFH|4.0|There will always be naysayers to a franchise such as Spiderman's. It's a mega blockbuster and come time for a sequel, expectations run amok. But I am happy to report that the third outing of this arachnid adventure is just what you would want it to be: very decent popcorn, amid some gulpy, wide-eyed sips of Coke.<br /><br />Nothing more, nothing less. Don't read too much if you haven't seen the film, it is best enjoyed with minimum hopes. The visual FX are a labor of love and grandeur, despite the running lament of CGI geeks. I had little idea prior to the movie that one of the villains would meet his biological alchemy. Very well composed (and decomposed).<br /><br />In trying to better what he has accomplished before, the director may have gone over-board by tripling the number of characters and by going for a much too bombastic face-off in the climax, which only amount to the exact opposite: a diminishing effect. But that is offset by the rewards of continuity from previous 'episodes'. There's a heady dollop of good-natured humor, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, love, morality, even some funky moves on the dance floor! Which is fun as it goes a bit beyond senseless derring-do.<br /><br />In the end, Spidey III is a refreshing departure from cardboard caricatures of good and evil. Bad guys are not always dripping in venom (they have a reason to do what they do, sometimes even rooted in affection), nor the good guys in saccharine. Tobey Maguire is effortless as the gentle, goofy Peter Parker, but we see an extra sliver of his acting range as he stretches his character--and his Spandex--when he is overcome by a dark, sinister thingie. Gives a whole new meaning to the expression \\"getting one's tights in knots\\".<br /><br />A word for Topher Grace. I am thoroughly impressed by how far he has come from That Seventies Show, to capers such as 'P.S.' and In Good Company, to a sharp, screen-dominating cameo in a Level A blockbuster. And he is equal to the task. His gamble with being the baddest of the bad guys, whose vindictive gene gets the better of him at last, is administered with such flair that one is guilty of hoping he would come around in the end. Does he? I'll leave that for you to find out. While he is at it, he sure is punchy.<br /><br />This is no classy noir but it is spectacular. And while it is studded with perhaps more characters than it may have time to fully develop, it does do its job, and does so with flying colors. Literally.with being the baddest of the bad guys, whose vindictive gene gets the better of him at last, is administered with such flair that one is guilty of hoping he would come around in the end.

B000ESST6U|5.0|<br />An opera performance that includes the musical insights of conductor William Christie and the imaginative production values of Glyndebourne can hardly fail, and the performance of Handel's \\"Giulio Cesare\\" captured on this new 3 DVD set succeeds admirably. The entire cast sings and acts with excellence, but I feel compelled to praise the brilliant and beautiful young American soprano Danielle de Niese, whose gorgeously costumed Cleopatra--an impudent sexy adolescent Queen of Egypt, married by Egyptian custom to her brother Ptolemy and locked with him in a violent struggle for sole possession of the throne--develops into a woman maturely in love with the Roman conqueror Julius Caesar. Sarah Connolly is totally convincing in the trouser role of Caesar (written by Handel for a castrato), and sings with true bel canto viruosity. In the orchestra pit, The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment provides an exemplary accompaniment. The setting and costumes for the story have been updated to the 19th century: Roman soldiers are dressed as British redcoats, guns are fired, modern battleships float on the waters of the backdrop. This also is convincing; colonialism and imperialism remain much the same from the time of the Roman conquests to the time of the Suez Canal and beyond. Despite these anachronisms, Baroque music performance style is observed and the repeated sections of da capo arias are expertly embellished. With this production, the Glyndebourne directors intended explicitly to entertain the audience as well as to satisfy the experienced music lover; they succeeded. The opera itself is one of Handel's finest. Audio for the DVD is superb high fidelity, video is brilliant high definition. Extra documentary features offer interesting glimpses behind the scene at Glyndebourne. A literate and lavishly illustrated booklet is enclosed with the boxed set. The price for all of this is remarkably reasonable. What more could you wish for?
B000LXH0AE|5.0|The 2nd best film of 2006. A comedy only insomuch as films like \\"Being There\\" and \\"Being John Malkovitch\\" are comedies. Brilliant script, story and perfs. from everyone. VERY nice perf. by Queen Latifah.
1582701709|3.0|The author restates what has been in literature for a long time--The power of thinking.   I am concerned that people will develop guilt when \\"all good things\\" do not happen to them and will fault themselves.  Reality is that bad things happen to all people.  There is not enough emphasis in the book on the actions that need to accompany the thinking. Also, as a reader of Scripture, I found much of the information both complementary to scripture and contradictory to scripture.  Therefore, as with all books, this book needs to be read with much discernment.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|If you own a DVD player what ever the format (standard, HD, or Blue Ray), you should have Planet Earth in your collection. The best thing I have seen on TV.
1400063515|1.0|very difficult to follow. very disjointed writing. a poor follow up to fooled by randomness. reminds me of a music group with a great first hit single - the next song is a flop and the group never achieves the same results. but of course there was no reason to infer that since his first book was excellent, the second would be the same. the black swan is an example of taleb's very point about the pitfalls of inductive reasoning. but it's not like he had 10 bestsellers and this the eleventh was a failure. the flop of the second novel by the fictional author in the book is a fitting end to this book. or maybe i just missed the point of it all
B000J103YI|5.0|CD was as described, arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.  Thank you
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  This the kind that I watch over & over! <br /> <br />I have been waiting for years for this one to be available on DVD. <br /> <br />I was ten years old when it was first released.  Watching this movie takes me back to those WW2 years.  Those years were mainly very sad - this movie cheered us up!
B00007AJF9|4.0|I was almost as much enamored by the stunning visual feel, cinematography and lighting-effects of this film, as the performance by Miss Blanchette. This film ranges in tone: from silly to grave timbres, certainly covering the catharsis of emotion, as well as creating believable characters (with a glaring exception or two: you be the judge) ...this film would round out the many colors in a collector's set of biographical royalty movies. I'm not sure I'd watch it five times a week, but I'd make sure it didn't gather too much dust in my collection.

B000EHSVOG|5.0|In this age we live in, one of ultra-serious tragedy abounding in daily news, the genre/medium of the American Disaster-Thriller Flick is a wonderful diversion from reality and sometimes a downright *HOOT* ... Disaster movie-as-vehicle for questionable performances by aging famous stars can, in a way, be a touching reminder of their theatrical days gone by... but let's just laugh, shed a tear, sweat it out, and have fun with this film, the Airport-movies series, Poseidon Adventure, and more~! <br />My only regret is that Fred Astaire doesn't dance enough in this one, like in the olde days with Ginger Rogers :P
1582701709|1.0|I was so disappointed in that book! I thought there would be something new, never before seen in print the way it was tauted by friends and the media. <br />It's been said before by better authors...namely, Norman Vincent Peale..in the Power of Positive Thinking.....and big companies trying to  <br />generate fires under their employees to produce more...i.e.Arbonne International at any National Conference or meeting...(a major network marketing company with anti aging products from Switzerland)... <br />I do, however, think the illustrations, and book layout were exceptional..and loved the size of the book.....so it will stay in my home, but will not suggest it as a \\"good read\\"... <br />Carol Verna, Woodland Hills, CA
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Forbidden Planet may just be a sci-fi genre collector's cult classic... but it *does* have interesting moral and philosophical implications, as well as tons of fantastic special effects, especially given that this Sci-Fi film is   50-something yrs old now! <br />my reaction to casting (Walter Pidgeon really got lost in the part, i think) is mixed... as much as Pidgeon and Leslie Nielsen seemed overdone, the real hero-duo in this production is Robbie The Robot and Anne Francis... just my own taste, not everyone's tea. <br />Buy and watch this flick. It's a timeless fave, for the stated reasons.

B00003CXSP|4.0|Hannibal is a great movie, and it is worth watching.  But, if you did not feel satisfied from the movies ending, then read the book.  It will more than fill your appetiete for Hannibal Lector.  Hannibal is by far the best book in the series and it has alot more information than the movie.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because the book was so amazing.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This romantic comedy is definately for those who love romance and happy endings.  It is sooo cute!
B000089A07|4.0|I give this movie four stars, because like all Hannibal Lector movies, the book is better.  But if you are not up for reading a book, then the movie is a short and sweet summary.  Of course Anthony Hopkins is as slithery as ever, but the rest of the cast is also amazing.  Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes are more than qualified to fill these complicated roles.  If you have ever seen Man Hunter, erase it from your memory, it will only cause you damage.  Red Dragon is a much better version than Man Hunter.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really enjoyed this series on DVD.  It was a real shame the series did not last any longer.  This is a series any SciFi lover will really want.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|A wonderful film, well presented on disc with excelent commantary track and worthwhile extras. It goes well with the VIVA ALMODOVAR set I bought on Ameazon Marketplace after I had purchased VOLVER. I got this set after much  dleiberation. I'd already bought three of the movies on the 8 disc set and I had one on laser disc, but I still wanted the others, which are not avaialble singly. But the $90 price tag was too steep. so, I waited, and got a new set for 44 bucks on the Marketplace. It's great to have as many movies by this great director as I can.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Beautiful package set. Quality material. Gave it a 3 because Lucas changed the ending to Jedi so it matched with the prequels. What a jerk!
0060578793|5.0|Every 'outdoors' man should have this book.   <br />I will probably never have to use 99% of the survival techniques but it's fascinating reading anyway. <br />This book sits on my coffee table and travels with me everywhere. <br />Open any random page and you will be instantly fascinated by the topic. <br />Very well written, good instructions and excellent diagrams/pictures.
0143038419|5.0|What a lovely ride!  Such an honest, heartfelt journey EG shares and I was glad for the invitation.  Rich in experience and told with style, it was like going right along with her, vicariously enjoying even the food.   A perfect remedy for pain or confusion.  The characters along the way could have come out of an imaginative mind, but were real and related with respect and gusto.   I am sure Ms. Gilbert will encourage in her writing, a more courageous solution to the problem of identity crisis.  Instead of self pity, continuing on the journey with an open heart and mind and discovering what else life has to offer.   One of those books that I could savor slowly and completely satisfied, reluctantly came to the end.
141694740X|4.0|Bought this book for a change of pace and to laugh. It is a great read if you are looking for something light and humorous. I am sure there are a lot of women out there who could benefit from the advice! It's definitely and empowerment piece! LOL

B000MRAAJW|5.0|After watching several episodes of \\"Planet Earth\\" in HD on the Discovery Channel, I knew I had to own this - in HD.  Purchasing the series in HD required me to upgrade to an HD-DVD player, which then necessitated the purchase of a new surround-sound receiver when we realized that our surround-sound wasn't compatible with the HD-DVD player, and finally a new sub-woofer when I realized the old sub-woofer was not compatible with the new receiver.  Several hundred dollars later, all I can say it, it was worth it!!  The cinematography is absolutely stunning as the magnificent handiwork of our Creator God is displayed over and over again.  Having watched the series on TV with Sigourney Weaver's narration, I definitely prefer the original BBC version with Sir David Attenborough.  This is an outstanding series!
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Incredible as it may seem, Ridley Scott actually had a better film than what was initially released.  I wish I had known of this Special Edition at the time of the first DVD release so I could have waited.  Instead I'm stuck with two versions of the same movie and though there is a certain \\"insight\\" into the process of making films (and dealing with studios etc) that comes with this abundance I can't avoid feelin just a little gipped.
6304712936|5.0|i had to look at this movie for a classical music class i took in college and i thought it was going to be boring and braced myself for it - and actually it had me rolling! good movie! i had to buy it for my movie collection! (i collect movies as well as scents)
B00005JPG3|5.0|I was just a kid during those days, but I do remember hearing about it.  As a 50 year old now, I was impressed with how much work went into this film to recreate those days just as they were without overdoing it.<br /><br />The look was right on, the look of early 70's San Francisco perfectly recreated.  I thought Jake G. did a great job considering how obscure his character was to begin with.  He is the main element of the movie rather than the killer which was good to know.  The creepy end title music \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man/Donovan\\" was perfect!

A very nice gift for young people and parents who read with their children especially younger generations this book introduces them to a great classic.

B000KCHZK6|2.0|I love almost everything Norah Jones does, but this CD is a yawn festival. It doesn't have the hook that her other work has. I would wait for this one to go on sale before buying.
0763621803|5.0|My son is obsessed with this series - the books and DVD's. He is also a fussy eater - perfect for that - it makes food fun and silly. Also such a wonderful example of a great sibling relationship. highly recommended. I got this when my son was 2 1/2.

B000002KY8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums/CDs EVER!  It was so far ahead of its time, as is usually the case with Prince's music.  I listen to this every day while driving in to work, sometimes while doing homework, or cleaning house.  Regardless of what I am doing, as soon as \\"1999\\" starts I am ready to take on anything. <br /> <br />I adore Prince and admire him for his God-given musical talent and his self-confidence.  There is something to be said for a person who can write a number one hit overnight AND play all of the instruments on that number one hit (When Doves Cry from the Purple Rain CD).  Not only is he one of the most forward-thinking musicians of all time, he is, without question, THE most talented musician in pop history.  He is also the sexiest musician I have ever seen.  I thought that when I saw him in concert in 1986 in England, in the movies Purple Rain and Under the Cherry Moon and still think it today, over 20 years later, when he performed the half-time show for Superbowl XLI.  Even now, in my 40s, when I watch his movies I get chills just listening to him sing and scream.  To meet him would be a 20+ year dream come true for me.     <br />

We decided to re-purchase because we wanted our 17 year son to read it.  We felt that he would be receptive to the ideas outlined in the book and would find them helpful as he goes forward in life.
B000021XR5|5.0|for my buck the best record in their collection, slightly ahead of purple and tiny music...well put together, and songs like atlanta, sour girl, and i got you show amazing versatility! it's really sad that critics don't give these guys their just due. a reunion tour would be fire! forget the police!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Quite simply, the best bond movie! Daniel Craig might go down as the best Bond ever if he continues in this vein. He is the whole package. This is the first time that I felt that Bond could kill someone with his bare hands. The action was quite nice and to top it all, the acting was first class. I am definitely waiting for the next bond film. <br />The movie shows how Bond became the Bond we all know. This Bond lacks all the polish that we are used to seeing and hence it was a pleasant surprise. Great way to restart the series and am sure they will continue to mould his character in the following movies. <br />Definitely a MUST SEE for all you movie lovers out there. 5 * out of 5!
B000001FZK|4.0|It's obvious that Talk Talk were getting as far away from pop music as they could by the time this CD was issued. This CD sounds much more like solo effort that Marc Hollis released years later. The songs are well played, the tunes are nice but not really easy listening type, so you have to listen a couple of times before you remember them. I just missed  a couple of more recognisable melodies (think of Life's what you make it, Living in another world, Tomorrow started etc), but wasn't disappointed in general.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|This is definitely one of the better action movies I have seen in a long time. The comedy in the movie is also worth a watch. Stephen Chow tells a great story with absolutely amazing special effects. I have watched this movie many times and watching it on Blu-Ray is an experience in itself. <br />From the opening sequence, you are drawn to the plot and Stephen's portrayal of his character is first-class. His tribute to Bruce lee is evident throughout the film. <br />This is definitely a MUST WATCH for all!
0765315246|4.0|Have been looking for somebody new to read for a while.  I read this and then bought everything he has written. <br /> <br />Great story.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie showed me a lot.  I had no idea Helen Mirren was in this movie.  What a movie!  Baryshnikov is as always an amzing dancer, but what an actor too.  And Gregory Hines is amazing too.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|Movie Score: 4/5  <br /> <br />Just when it seemed the Bond franchise was getting stagnant, Casino Royale comes and serves as a much needed breath of fresh air into the series. Although I was a bit disappointed in the way that Pierce Brosnan was unceremoniously dumped, I have to say, it appears that Daniel Craig was certainly up to the task and has already proven himself a worthy successor. <br /> <br />Although the story is a bit predictable and it does drag in a few places, the adaptation of the very first Bond novel is quite entertaining. There are some insightful moments that really let you delve a bit into Bond characters (such as why he tends to somewhat, umm, objectify women over the years) However, there are plenty of great Bond action sequences. There is an extraordinary chase scene early on in the movie that really helps it get off with a bang. <br /> <br />It seems with this movie that the studio was initially going for a test run with Daniel Craig at the helm of Bond. However, what very well could have would up being a medicore movie wound up become a stellar one with solid performances given all around. Cheers to everyone involved in the making of this film. <br /> <br />This film achieves all it sets out to as it will surely catapult Daniel Craig's name into the mainstream;s collective conscious and build high anticipation for future installments to come. <br /> <br />Video: 4/5 <br />Audio: 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Video and audio are both superb. One of the best Blu-Ray releases I have seen so far from both a video and an audio standpoint. Highly reccomended. A great technical showpiece early in the Blu-Ray's life-cycle. The video was vibrant and certainly a noticeable upgrade from standard defintion. While there are a few blu-ray titles out there sporting better visuals, Casino Royale is by my no means lacking in this department. 1080p is, with the case of blu-ray, once again a given. <br /> <br />The uncompressed 5.1 PCM sound track does a wonderful jobof bringing every gunshot, grunt, and groan to our ears. The aural component of this film is very much a winner and will surely make you the envy of anyone whom you present this film to (especially if they know little about hi def video/audio) <br /> <br /> <br />Extras: 2.5/5 <br />We all know that MGM knows how to make a film proper, so how about learning how to give a solid slate of extras along with the film. Is it really that much to ask for? The extras are sorely lacking and the absence of a commentary in this day and age is simply unexcusable. Hopefully, they'll learn to clean up their act. <br /> <br />Final Verdict: Buy it.  <br /> <br />While a double dip of this film is imminent (see: every other re-hashed Bond film), if you can look past the sore lack of extras, this disk delivers everything else in spades. Strongly reccomended.
034544678X|3.0|I have enjoyed but this is not one of those dog books you can pick up and find a quick fix to a problem.

To read an interesting book on dogs and get some good information.
6304712936|5.0|Amadeus was released in 1984; 25 years later it is still an exceptional movie.  Even though they portray Mozart as a buffoon, who is also a musical genius, the sensational music is timeless.  The sets and costumes are extraordinary, as are the acting performances.  F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as Antonio Salieri; he literally steals the show from Tom Hulce, who portrays Mozart.  Amadeus is a first rate film that will still be magnificant 50 years from now.

B000N3T0DW|4.0|VOLVER is a good movie, but not your typical Pedro Almodovar film.  The film has exceptional performances especially by Oscar-nominated Penelope Cruz & Almodovar regular, Carmen Maura.

TIE ME DOWN, ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, TALK TO HER, and BAD EDUCATION, but its still worthwhile similar to WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

B000286RKW|5.0|I had already seen the movie before I bought this two-disc special edition.  It's one of my favorite movies, although the language is very strong (the f word is repeated over and over), but it's such an interesting story that I love the movie anyway.  It has some violence (after all, it's about the Mafia), but it also has some humor.  If you like the Godfather, you'll probably like this, if the language doesn't bother you too much.
B00028HBKC|5.0|the movie was excellent. the characters performance was excellent and i love Mel Gibson
0743454537|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a great read for teenagers and parents. <br />
B00005K3OT|5.0|I saw Chocolat at the theater when it was new, now I've bought it for my collection.  I love Chocolat every time I watch it!!
B0007OY2MG|4.0|This season really shows the transitions their relationship is taking with Rory growing up. The show is not afraid to go places that don't feel good, but make it so relatable.  <br />I definitely recommend this one.
1582701709|5.0|I have bought 4 of these books as gifts (I bought myself the DVD).  It is a great gift to show You Care and, I think every household should have one.
1581806574|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday gift for my 11 year old daughter.  She is a big fan of fantasy creatures, and loves to draw-however, is not especially gifted at it.  This book makes it easy for her to draw dragons and other creatures with much more skill and detail.  It was a big hit.  I would reccomend it to anyone who loves fantasy creatures but may need help w/ drawing them.
B000LSAJ3O|5.0|If you are a Toto fan, this live concert is a must have!
6304602944|4.0|Has everything needed. <br /> <br />*Two friendly and enjoyable cops. <br />*Romantic Tension <br />*Big cars <br />*Big guns <br />*Action Action Action <br /> <br />I give it two thumbs up.
B000002GQL|4.0|Said to be loosely based on the Canterbury Tales (or at least it started that way), Seventh Sojourn was the Moodies' last album before a lentghy hiatus.  They definitely went out on a high point. <br /> <br />Three of their FM radio/concert staples are found here: \\"For My Lady,\\" \\"Isn't Life Strange,\\" and \\"I'm Just A Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)\\".  That alone will probably be enough for any serious fan to want this disc.  (If you are a serious fan and you aren't familiar with any one of those, trust me, you need to buy this!)  But what about the five other songs?  Like most Moody Blues album tracks, they take a bit of getting used to, but are worth the repeated listens.  The opener, \\"Lost in a Lost World,\\" comes as close as any song does to explaining why they broke up temporarily after this album, with its themes of isolation and lack of communication.  But on the surface at least, it's not autobiographical.  It's more of a rather cynical statement on the world at large.  \\"New Horizons\\" begins almost dirge-like, but the balladish melody masks an optimistic tale of finding oneself.  \\"You and Me\\" is one of their heavier rockers, and the \\"story\\" it tells works on a couple of levels.  \\"The Land of Make Believe\\" and \\"When You're a Free Man\\" are characteristic acoustic ballads with orchestral backing, less radio friendly than the songs you already know but just as enjoyable once you get used to them.  <br /> <br />The Moodies are as close as any progressive rock band ever came to being singles-oriented rather than album-oriented, and it does show occasionally here.  Still, it's one of the most consistent albums they ever made.
B000NA77YO|3.0|Not as good as Black Sabbath with Ozzy and not as Good as Dio alone but still a good cd.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Great Movie - Who is Kaiser Sosi? This where I became a real Kevin Spacey fan. This was his first Oscar winning role and he deserved it. The story is engrossing, and the climax terrific. If you haven't seen it, you won't guess what happens. I have never met anyone who has seen this film who didn't think it was terrific.
B000MV9026|5.0|We all loved this movie. Even my 13-yr old grandson wanted to watch it again. It is just a lot of fun and very heart-warming.
032147404X|5.0|I must say this book taught me so much in such a short period of time. <br />Scott Kelby has a unique way of helping us understand alot of techniques that in the past seemed very difficult. It just seemes so easy to learn with this book. I must say Mr. Kelby also seems like a very likeable person with alot of humor, and a few good jokes along the way. Some of them i read back to my wife, and she got a laugh.  <br /> I liked this book so much that I just purchased Kelbys photoshop elements 5 for digital photographers. Another excellent read. I will review that book also. Great book, great author. Just buy it!!
B00008973A|5.0|Saw the revival in Oct 2006 and have been listening to the CD every weekend ever since. Superb musical as was the original.
1582701709|5.0|I have studied many different fields of \\"metaphysical\\" thinking over the years. Everything from Buddhist to Thelema and Hermetic Traditions.  <br /> <br />This simple, small, unassuming book opened my eyes to the Universe in ways I never imagined. Stripped of the cumbersome ritual, uncertainty, insecurity and teacher/personality worship I have found so discouraging in my other studies, this book stripped bear the SIMPLICTY of the underlying \\"law\\" of the Universe.  <br /> <br />I have had many insights into my faith and experienced a harmonizing effect in the sense that I can now look back over my previous studies and fully, honesty UNDERSTAND!   <br /> <br />Give this little book a chance.  <br />
B000088E6D|3.0|Buble has the style and phrasing of the great singers of the 50's through the 80's.  He needs a little more work on his styling but that will only come with experience.  You like Sinatra and Darin?  Then give Michael Buble a shot.  You won't be disappointed.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Jude Law is so hot..He'll make a fan out of you in this chick flick.
0807014265|5.0|One of the great books of the 20th Century.  Frankel as a philospher and psychologist is to be admired for his legacy to mankind.  A must read for any serious thinker.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|This CD is a decent reflection of A-HA's talents, though I would have liked to hear it before buying it. I based my purchase decesion on glowing reviews and was hoping for a little more from the get go, though it does grow on you. No big hits like \\"Take on Me\\", and the main reason I bought this CD was for the song \\"I wish I cared\\" which is fantastic, and album would get 5 stars if they all followed it's strength.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter does not disappoint.  Based on the novels of Jeff Lindsay, Dexter is the story of a serial killer who murders other serial killers.  While yes he is a sociopath, I find that one of the most fascinating parts of both the novels and the Showtime series is that slowly Dexter is starting to show that he may even be developing emotions.  Could be a distinct possibility since he has had to wear a mask of humanity ever since he was three years old.<br /><br />The surprising thing about this show to me is that it is very different in many ways to the novels.  I think that Jeff Lindsay has to be both pleased and upset over what Showtime has done with Dexter.  And in my humble opinion, I think that the series is actually much better than the books.  The characters are much more developed and Deborah is no wear near as annoying in the series as she is in the novels.  Plus I like how Angel \\"No Relation\\" Batista is a full on Homicide detective instead of just working for the M.E.'s office.  In short, Showtime improved vastly on the novels and developed a much more diverse and rich world that Lindsay had created.<br /><br />The part that ends up really getting to the viewer the most is that Dexter becomes a hero of sorts that even though his actions are quite immoral, you begin to view them as justifiable vegence for the victims of the people he kills. Maybe admitting that means I have a problem myself LOL but seriously, you can't help but like the guy.  He is the nicest serial killer you could ever meet.  And make sure you do meet him and buy this DVD.  The replay value is outstanding.
B000N3SRRC|4.0|Great lyrics, driving beats, and a whole lot of funk.  There isn't a throwaway song on the whole album.  \\"Electric Worry\\" has a distinct blues flavor that makes it a standout, but every song will have you grooving in your seat.  If you are a fan of Clutch, pick this album up.
B000N6TX22|5.0|A must buy, but beware - the majority of the first-print discs have been wonky when played on certain HD players. Mine froze and skipped around on an Xbox 360 player. But, Universal is sending out replacements if yours crunks out. Don't be afraid to buy it however as the special features and the film itself are beyond 5 star quality. If you can find any discs from Cuaron, Innuritu, or Del Toro definitely pick them up. These 3 guys are the future of dramatic film and I couldn't be happier.
B00003CXAY|5.0|What a deal this was!  I bought both DVDs at a low price from Amazon, and realized after watching them that is was well worth the money.  The movies are really in depth, and though my TV is not an IMAX it does give that illusion.  Really trippy imagry, and factual acts of life give these two movies a high rating in my book.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|REALLY REALLY BETTER THAN GOOD!!!  Still fresh and has held up to all tests of time.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|What is there to say?  Diana Krall is simply the best.  This album is another fine example of consistently high quality musicianship.
B000002WU9|5.0|One of the best old rap CD's I've purchased.  Raekwon was a beast on this production; the beats, the story-telling lyrics.  Great CD. <br />
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|It's very early to review the above item, but it was received in less time than I expected and in good shape.  So far I've had no problems with it.  I thought this would be a good companion to the HP 11, which I've had for more than 20 years, and it works like the day I bought it.  Hopefully the HP 12C will serve me as well.
0151013047|3.0|Changez presents an interesting perspective of life in America in the aftermath of 9/11 but ultimately fails to deliver because ofhis overly superficial treatment of complex issues.  He disappoints with some unsupported statements such as that he took secret pleasure in the terrorism that claimed 3,000+ lives but gives the reader no reason, up to that point, why this should have pleased him. Changez experienced a first class university, acceptance by and recognition from his peers, and an enviable professional opportunity. He then expresses outrage at the US \\"invasion\\" of Afghanistan without an attempt to connect the dots.  He prides himself on his education and his enlightened background but he ignores the presence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, a brutal and oppressive regime that kept women in ignorance, most of the country in abject poverty and provided training grounds for terrorists. I would expect a more nuanced perspective from a Princeton educated observer. Again, his infatuation with Erica was cliche driven - the unattainable golden girl from Park Avenue.  This reader failed to feel his passion or the true nature of his involvement.
0439680093|5.0|This book is yet another fast and easy read from Anthony Horowitz. He manages to take you on a fast paced journey, all the while giving you characters to care about. His words provoke such clear images that you feel there is a mini movie going on in your mind.<br /><br />This one also plays with your mind, taking you through some evil twists and turns. By the end, you're anxious for the next in the series. The Power of Five series and the Alex Rider series are definitely appealing for adults as well as kids.
B000IONJJ2|5.0|This is a great set of CD's. The disc describing the making of the movie is as amuzing as the movie itself.  The story line of the movie is a typical example of English odd ball humor. No Amercan writer could have possibly invented it.  Not many comedies can be viewed more than once but this one will make you laugh no matter how many times you view it.
0743454537|3.0|This book is okay, but it feels so much like a Lifetime movie that it's quite hard to read and take seriously.  Everything seems to be designed to be a 2 hour melodrama on Lifetime.  Only read if you like generic Movies of the Week.
1587264013|5.0|I've always owned a copy of Little Women ever since I first read it at aged 9 (which means I've gone through numerous copies over the past decades!)  This particular edition is sturdy, attractive and exactly what I needed to replace my last falling-apart copy.  Since I read this book every year, I expect this copy will see me through at least another few decades!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This is one of the best Rocky movies made. Although it follows the typical Rocky formula, it is very touching and worth a watch. One thing I liked is that Rocky's opponent is for once a likeable character, and not detestable like Ivan Drago or all the \\"Anti-Rockys\\". This movie has alot of heart and concludes the series on a high note.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|We have been watching this movie almost yearly since we saw it the first time shortly after it came out.  We had a vcr version and watched it in our travel trailer.  Now with the dvd, we have introduced it to our youngest grandson.  For him it is a change from his normal space adventure.  And he loves it too.
014240165X|5.0|Boy, was I suprised at how wonderful this book was. I sometimes read books my children are interested in and they raved about this and the rest of the Alex Rider series. They were right. It reads so fast and easy that you feel you're gulping it down.  <br />Anthony Horowitz has a way of making you want to be a part of Alex's world. The gadgets and scenarios he finds himself in are not so out of this world that you can't relate. Once again, he has created a character that you need to know more about. I highly recommend this book and the movie for adults as well!  <br />
B000MV8ABS|4.0|Was just as much fun watching it again as it was the first time.  The Documentary of how it was made was also enjoyable.  Alot clearer than I remember on video tape.  All in all a great one!!!!
B000HCO83Q|5.0|A wonderful conclusion of a great story.  Enjoyed this not only for the great special effects but also for the acting by several of the stars.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This DVD collection of the first season of Everwood is wonderful.  This series deals with so many issues and difficulties that youth and adults alike face - it can be a great conversation starter for parents and their kids.
B000H5U832|5.0|Great film!  Excellent character voices.  A super film for the whole family.
B0000640SB|5.0|I watch movies simply to be entertained.  I don't want to bite my nails and I don't want to be taught a lesson.  I just want to escape for a couple of hours.  This movie gives me what I want.
0374105235|5.0|I bought this partially on a whim and partially because I heard it was a good story.  Normally when I see books being offered by non-booksellers, I think a touch feel good hope for humanity story.<br /><br />This was not the case.  It is the story of a child running from the war, caught up in the war and trying to return from the war.<br /><br />The story is an easy read.  Ishmael writes as if he is telling the story.  He tells of the simple childhood he was living.  Listening to American Rap, he speaks of his family, his friends, going to school and forming a music group.<br /><br />War destroys his home and scatters his family while he and his friends are going to perform a show for the neighboring village.  He describes running from village to village trying to hide from the rebels and yet find safety.  Sometimes they would find friends; sometimes they would be assaulted and or driven away.  Stories of the child gangs killing and plundering have traveled widely and people view a group of kids with suspicion.  There is even one act of cruelty where their shoes are taken and they are driven from a village and forced to walk across burning sand.<br /><br />The few times they find a welcoming village, it invariably gets destroyed by the rebels.<br /><br />They eventually find one place that has soldiers.  They think they are safe until one day the lieutenant announces they are surrounded and every able bodied male needs to fight.  He and his friends join the war.  They are trained and slowly brainwashed into fighting the rebels for revenge of family and friends that have been killed.  They are given drugs to \\"give them more energy.\\"  In the battles that follow some friends die and they slowly become drugged out killing machines.  They attack villages for supplies and kill the enemy without remorse and times rather savagely.  In time he even picks up a name \\"little snake\\" as he becomes rather adept at picking a good spot for shooting; aided by the fact he is a small in size.<br /><br />A couple years go by and eventually they come on a town where they see the lieutenant talking to some civilians.  The Lieutenant announces they have served their country and now their fighting is finished. Ishmael and a few others are picked, they are disarmed and escorted to trucks where they are taken to rehabilitation centers where they go through detoxification and rehabilitation.  In time he comes to hate the phrase \\"It's not your fault\\"<br /><br />Over time he slowly begins to leave the soldier behind.  Later he learns he has relatives and in time goes to live with them.  His uncle welcomes him without question and tells him that he and his wife know of his past but his cousins do not.<br /><br />Slowly things are returning to \\"normal\\"  He goes to a dance.  He is called on to go to a UN conference about child soldiers and children in war zones.<br /><br />The war comes again.  There is a coup and the rebels work with the new government.  They basically wander around killing people.  He tries to survive and he feels if his old army buddies spot him, they will kill him.  Eventually his uncle gets sick and dies.  He decides he has to leave the country else he will become a soldier again or be killed if he refused.  He contacts a woman he met in New York during the conference and she offers to take him in.  He then goes about trying to get to Guinea where he can make his way back to New York.<br /><br />In some ways I wish the book had more.  For example, you don't get \\"a where are they now\\" section.  It would have been nice to hear about what happened to some of the people he knew.  However, the story would have suffered if it was an academic effort.<br /><br />You get a short chronology of the history of Sierra Leone.<br /><br />Overall I found it very interesting.  I should say that if you are rather squeamish about violence, you might be bothered by his descriptions about killing and the violence he saw.ct he is a small in size. <br /> <br />A couple years go by and eventually they come on a town where they see the lieutenant talking to some civilians.

1881273156|5.0|This book is a great book to understand other's view on how they percieve love.  It explains there are basically 5 different types of love languages and gives examples of how to show love to a person with a particular love language.  It is a short and easy read, divided into chapters making it convinient to reread any chapter/love language that pertains to you or your spouse.
B000000WFZ|5.0|An excellent sound track from a powerful movie. Ennio Morricone is a very gifted composer and really captured the haunting beauty of the film. Well worth listening to.
0767805712|4.0|Uma Thurman is a favorite actress of mine and since this film included her husband at the time Ethan Hawke,I thought it couldn't be a bad movie.<br /><br />The subject line is about a man who always felt inferior and had the opportunity to excel.<br /><br />Sci_Fi at the time,it is becoming plasible at this time.<br /><br />Changing and rearranging DNA always a unique idea and subject too controversy.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|\\"Children of Men\\" is the kind of movie that leaves you thinking ... long after the credits roll. Are human beings headed for this sort of dark and dangerous future? Are we racing toward our own demise? Clive Owen provides the perfect calm demeanor for this chaos driven film. I'll watch this one more than once.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, Will Smith is a favourite of mine, but this was exceptional, a great story of hard work and determination paying off in the end. It was inspirational for anyone who is struggling through life.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Not only do my kids beg for Pan everyday, I catch myself watching it with them. The magic is still there.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|The unexpected harmonies in some of the songs were enjoyable. <br />Many artists show excitement and can harmonize, but the work done here shows   <br /> a love of music, a love of heritage, & a love of hard work.
1581806574|4.0|As a freelance artist I have perused many art books and I find this one to be quite a catch.  Dragonart is aimed more toward the beginner artist then the experienced one, but even I have found a few new ideas to try from this book. <br /> <br />The book takes a friendly laid back approach to drawing.  It begins with basic anatomy, the subject that perhaps is the greatest obstacle to an artist, discussing how to properly design your dragon so that it looks pleasing and has a sense of weight and realism.  The book then refines your drawing skills with details on drawing those difficult body parts such as hands, paws, wings, and maws.  The pages are filled with colorful examples and the text is easy to read and understand. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to other artists, both novice and experienced, who enjoy drawing one of the most inspirational creatures ever to appear from our imaginations.  If you are not an artist, but are a collector of dragon books, this one might be a nice touch to your collection. <br />

0393327655|4.0|A very good title. Substance a bit predictable but covers a number of areas well. I just wish authors in this genre would think more about what challenging questions we ought to rehearse and fire at believers in the sort of pre-enlightenment superstitions and fairey tales he describes. Reason could then be used as a tool instead of something being lost post 9/11.

6305291446|5.0|In 1998, Director Steve Minor put his stamp on the Halloween series.  This is the entry, the sequel everyone was looking forward to, the return of Jamie Lee Curtis and when Laurie and Michael see each other again.  \\"I'm not who you think I am.\\" is exactly right, it truely is a great sequel even though it is part 7. <br /> <br />Laurie has a 17 year old son and she is the headmistress of a secluded private boarding school.  20 years after he first attacked her he came back, she thinks her son is the one in danger, he is, but she has more to fear than her son's life.  Laurie stops running and faces her fear in the most amazing ending the series has ever seen. <br /> <br />Note that this movie completely ignores parts 3-6 so continuity for this entry as part of the series is completely screwed up.  The acting is extra ordinary in this entry, the best acting in the entire series comes from this entry.  Jamie gives her strongest performance as Lauries in this entry.  And unlike the previous two entries Michael is top notch in this entry, Michael is really scary. <br /> <br />This entry doesn't suffer from much asside from giving LL Cool J a role this entry soars on all levels.  The ending where she attempts to grab his hand is the most emotional part of the series. <br /> <br />The bonus feature \\"Unmasking the Horror\\" is very informative, but again, Jamie sounds like an idiot in her interviews and everyone else sounds smarter than her which is the exact opposite as on film where she appears to be the smartest person on screen. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is the definitive ending to one of the longest running horror series.  This entry has an A list cast and some great scares.  Too bad the series continued on and on and on...
B000FQJAIW|5.0|When I reached my 1,000th review on Amazon, I gave a lot of thought as to which item I wanted to be in that 1,000th spot. After all, I spent many years writing all of these reviews! Finally, I decided the spot should belong to Star Wars. This movie is one that literally affected the vocabulary of the world, and has become a cultural touchstone decades later. You can point out many books, movies, TV shows and even documentaries and news stories that refer to plot situations and characters from this very first Star Wars film.<br /><br />I was a child when the first Star Wars came out, and I literally went to see the show over 10 times in the theater. It was that powerful for me. There was a princess who stood up for herself - who grabbed the gun and defended herself, who helped plan the escapes and attacks. But on the other hand this wasn't a war movie - there were characters who talked about how the universe was interconnected and how every person in it could make a difference. People of all shapes, sizes and colors were accepted here. There were infinite worlds and infinite options. I adored this movie.<br /><br />While I appreciate the \\"improvements\\" made to this over the years, I really feel strongly that the original story was powerful because of the way it was written. It was the story that mattered - not high-flying special effects. I liked that Han shot first when he was in trouble. I liked that Mos Eisley was a desolate, quiet town - and that to Luke, this was a \\"big city\\". It really showed the relative value we all place on community. I think the *only* thing in the first movie that seemed a bit odd was when Han and Chewie were chasing after the stormtroopers on the Death Star - and fled because there were suddenly more than two. I do agree that that one change was probably necessary, but given that they were able to have \\"lots of people\\" (real or fake) in the final medal-presenting scene, I would have thought Lucas could have pulled that off here as well.<br /><br />In any case, I think there is a huge value in seeing the actual movie, as it was released, without any trickery or post-movie additions. I also think, if you've somehow never seen this movie at all, that you should really watch it at least once. With all the many subtle references to this movie that pop up in our culture every day, it's good to have that grounding and be able to understand the references properly.r /><br />In any case, I think there is a huge value in seeing the actual movie, as it was released, without any trickery or post-movie additions.

Their earlier records are also good but they really came up with something unique on this one. If you like Prog, try this record. Give it few listens, even if it doesn't hit you at first, in a while you won't be able to get it out of your head.
0735619670|5.0|This book turned to be exactly what I expected. It's one of few books that I have that is fun to read. It's not just a practical guide for software construction, but it also points out everything you need to know about software development cycle if you don't already know them.<br /><br />The actual talk about software construction starts at chapter 5. The chapters before this is an emphasize on the importance of software prerequisites and its impact on projects success.<br /><br />The book is a must for anyone involved in software development.

B000FA57US|1.0|In 1989, Director Dominique Othenin-Girard unleased the worst entry in the Halloween series to date. Nothing good came out of this entry. What came was horrendous acting, ugly teens, and a music score that is a total embarassment. <br /> <br />Michael apparently didn't die in the explosion at the end of #4, he escaped and traveled down a river instead.  A year later, Jamie is a mute (a bad decision because she's the only main character that does a decent job) and Dr. Loomis has been keeping a very close eye on little Jamie Llyod.  Racheal is going away for the weekend, but while she's packing, she dies. <br /> <br />More teens with bland faces who are annoying as hell and don't have a personality you will remember 20 minutes after you view the film, Jamie finally talks with about 1/16th of the movie left to go.  Donald Pleasence is great as always, but the writing is so increadibly awful that he can only do so much to save this movie, and even the great Pleasence cannot save this movie from being a total disaster.  Don Shanks is also the worst actor to ever wear the horrific mask.  Praise God he did not return for #6. <br /> <br />The bonus features on this DVD are quite good the audio commentary makes the movie slightly bearable, it's more entertaining than the movie will ever be.  Also, the documentary is very good and interesting. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is the worst horror film sequal I have ever seen in my life.  Avoid at all costs!  Even Halloween die-hards will have a tough time sitting through this entry.  For die-hards only.
B00000K0DT|5.0|The Usual Suspects is a film noir movie set in modern times. I adore film noir movies, and one of the first things you learn about this genre is NOT TO READ PLOT DETAILS! I will not give away ANY plot details in this review. If you get even the inkling of what happens in the plot, it tends to make you \\"wait\\" through the entire movie for that particular twist or turn to happen. It is so much better to watch the movie all the way through the first time, plot unknown, to watch how it unfolds. That's what makes the film noir movies so great for watching and rewatching. The first time you see it, you are caught up in how the mystery elements are linked together and unraveled. In subsequent watchings, you know what the end game is, and you now enjoy all the clues and hints that are laid out for you along the way. Where most movies can get boring after a viewing or two, I've seen many of my film noir movies quite a large number of times.<br /><br />The beauty of The Usual Suspects is the stellar cast involved - Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Spacey, and many others. Every one of these actors does a fantastic job. There are so many quotes, so many specific lines of dialogue, so many tiny eye movements and looks that just bring incredible depth to this story. Again, I don't want to give away the details of the plot for you to \\"watch for\\". Once you've seen the movie, there will undoubtedly be moments that stand out for you. But don't stop there. Go back and watch it again. Suddenly you'll realize the meaning in the way someone looks at someone else - the way someone reacts to a specific line of dialogue. It's simply brilliant.<br /><br />There are a number of heavily accented characters here which means the first time through you might not really realize what someone is saying. They do that on purpose. Those people *have* accented voices. It means you don't really understand what's going on in some scenes. Again, when you re-watch, you start to sink deeper into the environment. You realize what certain words mean. You realize the context of the situation. It is a multi-layered adventure and each time you take a look, something else unfolds for you.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for owning. This isn't a one-time-watch film. It's something you see multiple times, share with family and friends, and then discuss afterwards. Highly recommended!tart to sink deeper into the environment. You realize what certain words mean.

B00003CXB2|5.0|In a world where we can only take YouTube videos for 10 minutes at a time, or have commercials that are a brief 30 seconds long, it's amazing to expect people to sit still for 217 minutes straight in order to watch a long, drawn out epic story. This isn't a rough-and-fast war film full of flowing blood and heads blowing off. It's much more subtle than that. It's about understanding a people very different from yourself, about being willing to immerse yourself in their world. <br /> <br />Get yourself set up front for a long, thoughtful experience. Pour yourself a glass of wine. Set out a tray of cheese and grapes. Watch this on a widescreen TV if at all possible so you get the full sweeping experience of the hot desert, the enormous landscapes. This movie really does transport you to another world - where the ticking clock doesn't matter as much as the hot sun moving slowly ... slowly across the sky. <br /> <br />This really is a journey. Lawrence was an 'every man' at the beginning, drawn into the situation, drifting along. As he went, he grows, matures, and learns to take a stand. When others would abandon a boy to the fates, Lawrences decides that the boy can be saved. It is not up to nature - it is up to each of us, as a human, to make a stand for what we believe in. <br /> <br />This is definitely a film you want to watch on DVD - no commercials, no interruptions, no cutting out segments to \\"save time\\". It is almost a form of meditation, to immerse yourself in a world where a different clock kept time. The messages from the early 20th century are just as meaningful today. We must learn from our history. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS FILM. IT HAS SUSPENSE, ROMANTIC, COMDEY AND REALITY ALL WRAPPED UP IN ONE MOVIE.  I WAS IN THE SUPERMARKET A FEW WEEKS AGO WITH MY FRIEND AND TOLD HER TO HURRY UP BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO WATCH THE MOVIE.  THIS MAN SAID, ITS ON HBO OR SOME CHANNEL, I DON'T REMEMBER, BUT HE SAID IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE ALSO. THE MOVIE IS NOT NEW BUT I STILL WATCH IT AND SO DOES OTHERS. OH YES!  THE MOVIE SONG: DON'T WANT TO CLOSE MY EYES, DON'T WANT TO FALL ASLEEP, CAUSE I'D MISS YOU BABE, AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS A THING, NOW THATS HOT!!!
B000MCH5P4|5.0|A Really good representation of Latin Directors, Beatifull Photograpy and amazing Actors. only comparable with Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro Gonzales Iñarritu.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Casino Royale was overall an awesome movie. The blu ray looks way better than the standard dvd. For those of you who were waiting for a more realistic, dangerous Bond, you got him. This movie is action packed and with one of the greatest poker scenes ive ever seen. SEE IT!
B000BRBH90|5.0|Love this concert. For someone who has little exposure to her work, this DVD is perfect. It contains so many of her best songs and the production value is just phenomenal. I have watched this DVD many times and each time I am msmorized by the concert. Wish I was there.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I've never seen a historical rock documentary go into as much fascinating detail as this one does. <br /> <br />I was most impressed by the fact that the producers were able to get the original recording enginner, Alan Parsons, in the studio with the original master tapes and walk through the recordings track by track giving you a glimpse of the small pieces that make up the whole of this great recording.  <br /> <br />If the other artists and albums in this \\"Classic Albums\\" series didn't suck so hard, I'd buy every single one of them. Unfortunately, out of the whole work of these documentaries, there are only 2 or 3 projects that interest me in the slightest. I do, however, plan on investing in other DVD's from this series that feature artists that I like. <br /> <br />For any Floyd fan, this is a must-own. <br />
B000002H7I|5.0|This is an excellent CD. I have all of Tracy Chapman's music on old tapes and now I have them in a digital format. This particular album's songs seem to focus on freedom from oppressive situation of various natures. Very inspirational and soul inspiring!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|What can I say about Crystal Visions ? Excellent! It is the very best of Stevie Nicks. DVD Watch it all the time.  The CD listen to almost every day at work and at home...Edge Of Seventeen, Dreams, Silver Springs are updated a little but sound better than ever.  Wouldn't change a thing about it...So if your Stevie Nicks fan I'd say buy it.  You will not be disappointed.
B000003BDY|5.0|The raw power of the early Rolling Stones albums are awesome. Have been a fan of the Stones since the beginning.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I admint, I am a big fan of enigma but overall this album is very good. It's a culmination of their previous albums I would say - similar sounding tunes a little modified. I liked it
B00004Z4SD|5.0|It was a heartwarming story, like a book and movie should be.
0790733226|5.0|Contact is a movie about Astronomy and the search for signals in space from remote, intelligent life. Jodie Foster plays a gifted astronomer who struggles to keep her work and reputation alive in a very controversial field that very few people--including most other scientists--do not take seriously. Even a non-scientific audience cannot help becoming totally engulged in this story. The acting and direction are outstanding, and the special effects are stunning. The viewer is swept into a whirlwind of excitement and suspense as a world that does not yet exist for us becomes not only alive, but compellingly believable.
1582701709|4.0|This book is very inspiring. <br />This must be what praying once was meant to be
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah wrote an incredibly great book, A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier. I truly could not put the book down, as it was extremely absorbing reading. I understand why it is on the Best Seller Lists. I had seen an interview of Mr. Beal on television, and I thought that it might be interesting reading. I feel that we need to be especially sympathetic to the turmoil in Africa, whether it be in the genoicide of Darfur or the terrorist situation in Somalia. I feel that the book could be used by Universities as a reading requirement for incoming Freshmen.  <br />                                    Richard Klein, Ph.D.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|After waiting a couple of months for receiving the dvd's, I was glad to have . Very nice state, complete and without any damages of shipment. the extras which were promised were complete and in good shape. Sometimes there are little technical problems (no or scratched picture) but all in all a very good investigation. A musthave for all \\"Everwood-Freaks\\" ;)

B00003CXD0|4.0|Tootsie is an extremely funny, well-made movie for ages 15 and up. It is an inside look at acting and the acting market as well as a look at people and life itself. The acting and direction are top rate; the pace is non-stop. The story involves a talented actor (Dustin Hoffman) who cannot find work until he makes an impulsive and desperate decision.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|they still have it the music is as always great for the ears and eyes
B00007KWHG|5.0|Yes, a great one to have and really fun to listen to over and over. I have taken to work and everyone likes it alot. Thank you for putting it out there for us to listen to. Yeah!
0618551050|5.0|I strongly endorse the purchase and reading of this book for several reasons: <br /> <br />1. The author gives an accurate and understandable (even to the scientific layperson) explanation of the status of man's understanding (or lack thereof) of the fundamental concepts of nature. In short, he tells the reader what is, and is not understood by physicists to a reasonable degree of certainty. <br /> <br />2.Contrary to the misconceptions perpetrated by the media and many scientists, physicists are not \\"on the brink\\" of developing a \\"Theory of Everything\\" (TOE).  <br /> <br />3. String theory, touted as the \\"be all, and end all\\" of modern physics, is most likely not only wrong, but has led many researchers down a \\"blind alley\\". <br />  <br />4. As a matter of fact, there has been limited progress in the past three decades in understanding the basic laws of nature, much less having developed a TOE.  <br /> <br />5. Smolin gives what I believe to be a reasonable and accurate picture of the sociological processes such as groupthink that have led to this 30-year impasse. <br /> <br />6. Finally, he offers several candidate areas for ongoing research that offer some hope of renewed progress in our understanding of nature.  <br /> <br />I commend the author for insisting on maintaining an objective approach to science. As a scientist (physicist), and as a science historian, I know that this phenomena that Smolin writes about -far from being an unusual occurrence  in the practice of science- is, in fact, a fairly common occurrence. Some examples: <br /> <br />1. Geologists resisted for decades the \\"radical\\" concept of tectonic plate theory and the movement of continents.  <br /> <br />2. Physicists, as recently as the early 1900's scoffed at \\"peasants tales\\" of rocks falling from the sky. After many years, they were forced to acknowledge that meteors of various sizes are constantly striking the surface of our planet, sometimes with devastating effects. <br /> <br />3. Most scientists of the time of Galileo were opposed to the radical theory of a sun-based solar system (developed by a Catholic priest Copernicus) and clung to the earth-centered Ptolemaic system. It turns out that Galileo had no evidence to support his theory, but he turned out to be correct. Yet, historians today falsely put the blame on the Catholic church for \\"resisting\\" Galileo, when it was primarily the scientists of the time who opposed his views. It took many decades for scientists to accept the Copernican theory. <br /> <br />4. For nearly 100 years (in the 18th century), the theory of phlogiston was held, advocated and taught by the vast majority of scientists to explain the combustion of materials. This was in spite of a lack of evidence to support this theory and a growing body of evidence to contradict it. <br />  <br />5. In my own time, I can remember studying quantum mechanics and  accepting all its concepts as valid. My friend and fellow student scoffed at some of the \\"far out\\" claims of quantum theory. He was right, and I was wrong. While some of quantum theory has held up, it has certainly not proven nearly as valid and basic as previously thought.  I went with the crowd and fell prey to a groupthink mentality. <br /> <br />6. For the past 150 years, most people in the biological sciences have clung to a general theory of evolution to explain both the origin and development of species in spite of an almost complete lack of scientific evidence to support such a theory. There is no question that species adapt to their environment (such as the development of longer beaks) by relatively minor changes -called microevolution. But even after 150 years since the publication of the Origin of the Species, there has not been a shred of evidence to support transitional, gradual development of one major biological member into another major biological member -called macroevolutionary  theory. Darwin's macroevolutionary theory rested on two fundamental axions: <br />a.A functional continuum of all life forms linking all species together and ultimately leading back to a primeval cell. <br />b. A belief that all adaptive design of life has resulted from a blind random process <br />Neither of these two conjectures has been validated by a single empirical discovery or scientific advance.  In the past 30-40 years, advances in micro cell biology have shown the extreme complexity of individual cells as miniature \\"factories\\" performing many complex and interrelated functions which -according to many cell biologists-can not possibly have arisen in a single-step process Yet the majority of scientists cling to their \\"religious\\" belief in macroevolution: Another example of scientific groupthink.  <br /> <br />Lee Smolin has done a great service to science and to society by his writing of this highly informative book. <br />
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Hello, <br /> <br />I bought this DVD for my daughter. She loved the dancing, songs and story. Even my 12 year old son was dancing around the house singing the songs. Has some drug use in the film and is about people with AIDS. Heartwarming story that is worth watching.
B00005JLCI|5.0|It is one of Branagh's best goodies. I still like Mel Gibson's version a little better, but this one follows the play practically line for line.  Great actors, Kate Winslet, Judi Dench, Robin Williams, etc (to name a few). <br />Excellent interpretation.   <br /> <br />If you're a high schooler who wants to cheat and not read the play,  pick this version.  (This was meant to be seen anyway.  So don't feel guilty). <br /> <br />
B000FS9FCG|4.0|3.5 stars.  This is a descent movie, however, I think the concept and the story is better suited for graphic novel medium and doesn't translate as poignantly as a film.  Film, books and music are often warning us to mindful of our goverment and how easily we can slip into a totalitarian rule.  Fear is a very real weapon most goverments have already learned to weld to shrink civil rights in the name of national secruity.  Yet as a film, this one is missing some things.  I never truely contected with V.  There are a few scene when he comes off looking rather silly (cooking-kissing).  Weaving, likely a strong actor with a very theatrical voice, the mask was too cold a shield for an audience to connect to.  At the very least I would have liked to see his eyes.  Something for him to become more real to me.  Portman's character could have just as easily been taken out.  I know what she was suppose to symbolize, but, eh, I wanted her to be more involved in the revolution and I guess I wanted a bigger revolution than what was delivered on screen.  Again, it's a good film, just not a great one.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Lots of enjoyable tunes, but not many really \\"stick\\" with me. This album has a fairly pop music feel to it. While you can't really point to anything wrong with the songs, they don't really speak to you either. <br /> <br />It's worth the money but don't expect to be blown away.
0060578793|5.0|Over the years , I have purchased many outdoors survival books and have never felt like they have given me the confidence to really put them to possible use , if I  were put in  a real life situtation , until now . This book , after  reading it a couple of times , I believe has given me that confidence .  This book shows edible plants and reptiles , as well as poisonous plants in color . In color , it is much easier to recognize the correct plant or reptile.Making the right decision in the wild is a matter of  life & death . It  goes into great detail on how to get  food, water and to make shelter in any climate, anywhere . I would definitly recommend it to anyone .
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I think Rocky Balboa was a great success! It is impressive and emotional! I strongly advise you to watch this movie!
B000O174CM|3.0|Was really excited for Dreamgirls to come out.  I haven't seen the play, but I am happy that Hollywood is doing more film musicals.  I don't want to give too much away, but the story really becomes flowery at the end.  At the start it brings in heavy subjects like: drugs, pregnancy, weight problems, who is the center of the spotlight, love tiffs, and more.  I KNOW it's a musical, but this is obviously a biography of the Supremes.  And I am pretty sure the outcome that happened in the movie, didn't happen in real life. It has a great begining and build, but the conclusion is just not what I thought it was going to be. <br /> <br />I'm not going to say don't see it because the music is great, Jennifer Hudson deserved all her awards.  During the finish of her big number the theatre greatly applauded for her.  That never happens at movies!  See it for that.  But the script adaptation did not really sell it for me.    <br /> <br />
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a great general flash for any newer Nikon.  I used to be on a Canon system and had a huge assortment of accesories.  I switched to Nikon when the D50 came out.  So I had to start from scratch to get everything I needed.  Well, I had a top of the line hot shoe flash for my Canon but hardly used any of the features.  So I spent a huge chunk of money for a piece of unused technology.<br /><br />So when I finally got back into doing some photography I quickly found that I needed a new flash.  I have been on a tight budget recently and found the SB400 in my price range.  I bought it based on some of the reviews out on the net.  Reviews elsewhere show that people may have a SB 600 or 800, but for a lot of their work, they use the SB 400 most frequently due to its size.<br /><br />I bought the SB 400 and used it for the first time for a job last weekend.  I used it on a small senior portrait session.  It works very well!  I modified a Lumimax Proquest flash bounce to fit on the SB 400 because I didnt want to spend another $15 at the time when I knew I had this to at least to try to mod to work.  You can tell a very huge difference in fill with this flash compared to no flash.<br /><br />**Biggie for me at least..does not work with the SC-29 focus assitance<br /><br />Pros:  Small size; flash head only moves; uses only AA batteries (easy to find, cheap); fits perfectly in the included bag and fits into small compartments in your camera bag<br /><br />Cons:  Flash head only moves, not whole flash body (some flash accesories need modified or dont work);  no PC connections or battery pack connections; cannot control other flashes wirelessly; does not work with SC-29  focus assitant
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|What can you say about this landmark CD that hasn't already been said. It is a miracle of the genius of Paul Simon as he continuously trys to reinvent himself. My favorite tracks on this CD are the ones with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. This is a must have CD for any Simon fan or any fan of pop music. I recommend \\"Shaka Zulu\\" by Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Two great listens!
0316010669|5.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking is a book you can't put down. A very inspiring and easy read.  Malcolm Gladwell's writing style is smooth and delicious without being too complicated.  This book is for anyone interested in those little things you \\"know\\" but can't explain....Also read the Tippimg Point by Gladwell...you'll feel like you've learned something!
1582701709|2.0|Wouldn't recommend this one. Once you've read a few chapters there's no need to read any further.  The book lacks substance and is disjointed.
0486237664|5.0|This is just packed full of brilliant illustrations of birds frogs fish girafee spiders butterflies you name it , throughly recommended for any one who loves botanical illustrations or engravings , really good source material for artists or designers.very nice book but rember it is a paper back not that that matters to me.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|To me, this is probably the best film I have seen in years.  This film has it all.  Superb cast, mesmerizing cinematography and most important of all...a thought provoking script.  I have watched it many times.  Buy the DVD and check out the extra features.  I couldn't believe that there was so much about this film that I totally missed until I watched the commentary.
B0002YCVXI|4.0|Having recently succumbed to Yo Yo Ma after a longtime love of Ennio Marricone I was excited to get this CD from Amazon. It is superb! All of the songs had to be recrafted by Morricone to suit Yo Yo Ma but it is a great listen as you sonically travel down memory lane through some of Maestro Moricone's musical marvels. \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" from \\"The Mission\\" now becomes \\"Gabriel's Cello.\\" I laugh as Yo Yo Ma bows his brains out on the \\"Ecstacy of Gold' from \\"The Good,The Bad, and The Ugly.\\" I recommend this to all Yo Yo Ma and Morricone fans...a great listen. Soothing after a hard day!
0618680004|3.0|[[ASIN:0618680004 The God Delusion]] <br /> <br />The book was alright.  Not earth shaking and nothing that changed my mind much about anything. <br /> <br />Dawkins is a good writer and more entertaining than convincing.  I found myself being amused by his obvious frustration with the God or No God issue. <br /> <br />For centuries men have struggled with this question and have been unable to come up with any concrete proof one way or the other.  He presents a very eloquent and compelling argument to support his thesis but in the end I don't see that the \\"proof is in the pudding\\".
1582701709|5.0|Very good info not only on manifesting things but how to live your life using the laws of the Universe and becoming A person we would all like for A friend, neighbor, or relative!!!!
1594200823|4.0|After reading the opening chapter I thought I may have made a mistake because the vocabulary was very highbrow. However, once I settled into the book it became very fascinating how food makes it to your plate. I've never looked at processed food the same since reading this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who cares what they eat, which should be everyone.
B000M06K5C|2.0|I don't like having to write negative reviews...however.  I am pretty enthusiastic about much of the new music that gets played on alternative radio (such as the almighty KEXP in Seattle) and thus bought this CD based on the buzz around this band.   Unfortunately, I didn't hear much to match the hype.  The singers voice quickly grated on my nerves and repeated listens only verified my first impression.  Sorry.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is by far, the greatest movie for kids of all ages.  It is a wonderful, happy movie with a great sound track.  I havent met anyone who doesnt like this movie.  Simply wonderful, is all I can say!

B00011F5DK|5.0|This game reminds me of Tetris.  But you can only have the corners of your pieces touch, and you're playing against 3 other people for space.  It is a strategy game.  We have fun as a family playing it.  It is probably a 30 minute game.
0761944524|5.0|Andy Field gives simple explanations and humorous examples to make the confusing world of statistics more understandable. Highly recommended for anyone who is required to take statistics.
B000002G7G|5.0|It is impossible to over-emphasize how influential this band has been.  This is still my favorite V.U. album.  It gets better with each listen.
1569242739|5.0|Ever since being vegan I haven't found any good cupcakes. They've all been too heavy, the toppings thin like gravy, etc. This book changed all that. I had perfect cupcakes on my first try. The buttercream frosting is amazing, just make sure to use Earth Balance margarine, as some other margarines aren't firm enough.
0765315246|4.0|With, as of this writing, 161 reviews on file yet another seems like overkill. At the risk of not contributing anything further, some quick thoughts. <br /> <br />\\"Old Man's War\\" is a well written and refreshing read. Classic space opera, it moves along at a brisk pace. This is truly a good story and a fun read. <br /> <br />At the back of my mind, however, are some nagging thoughts. \\"The numbers\\" as they relate to stars in the sky, habitable planets and the size of the universe probably do not justify the conflict Scalzi envisions. Space is simply too big. If my consciousness were transfered to a green super-fit body after 75 years in my current model I think I would have some pretty significant mental adjustments to make. Amazingly, Scalzi's old men do not. John Perry is a very good soldier. Why? What makes him so good or what in his 75 years has led to his being so good? There is nothing on the dimension of Perry. <br /> <br />While these thoughts prey on my mind they should not stop you from reading \\"Old Man's War\\". Take a break from the everyday and have some fun. Enjoy.
B000M341RI|5.0|If you enjoyed the original then you should be pleased with all the new bells and whistles in this edition.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|This is classic Van Halen.  \\"Runnin with the Devil\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\", and \\"Jamie's Cryin\\" are my favorites.  I also like the hard rockin' version of the The Kinks' \\"You Really Got Me\\".  Turn up the Volume and enjoy this one!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|Ends where nicely tied up in this last movie.  A real good final movie for the Rocky pictures.
0395389496|5.0|This is such a wonderful heartwarming story. I have read this to my classroom for years and now share it with my own child. Terrific. And of course the illustrations are beautiful.
B000MV9026|5.0|he was already a fan of the penquin sequence to madagascar. this just gave him an added thrill and enjoyment
B000FFJ85I|5.0|No, this album is by no means like anything else you've heard by them, but if you are a true AFI fan you are going to know that already.  None of their albums have ever sounded the same. They grow between each record.  The earlier hardcore punk kids have now evolved into something that you just cant classify.  The only thing you can do is sit back and listen.  The hard work that went into this cd is clear and it was well worth the three year wait between STS and DU.  Davey blows us away again with his powerful voice and lyrics and Hunter, Jade, and Adam are right there with him pounding unforgettable music through our veins. <br /> <br />Prelude is a great opener with a heart pounding drumbeat and amazing guitar. Davey's voice is commanding and soft at the same time, a real preview for what is to come for the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Kill Caustic is one of the two hardest songs and probably the one closets to resembling anything from Black Sails on backward. <br /> <br />Miss Murder was the single we waited for and it was amazing when it came out.  Its the way the close their shows and it really is just a good fun song.  Not that the lyrics arent deep, but the music will cause you to bop your head despite what the words are. <br /> <br />Summer Shudder should have been the third single but I think they have decided to go with The Missing Frame.  Melodic with a little bit of violin.  Great song. <br /> <br />The Interview was the first song on the cd to send chills down my spine. Davey's voice is amazing here and the lyrics are beautiful.  Its the slower song on the cd and its one of my favorites.  \\"Hold me you may drop me tomorrow' is an amazing line and the emotion you hear in Davey's voice makes it all the better. <br /> <br />Love Like Winter is catchy and its fun and just a good song that really shows where some of their influences come from. <br /> <br />Affliction is the second hard hitting song on the cd and its coupled with hard hitting music and melodic background vocals. Nice. <br /> <br />The Missing Frame was the song they chose as single number three and it definitely has the potential for airplay.  Its one of the longest songs on the cd, but its not overdone. <br /> <br />Kiss and Control... God, its my favorite one.  This was the one I wanted as a single because as an AFI fan, its the videos that make a lot of this so much fun and this would have made an amazing video.  Its dark and rough and everything you'd want in a song.  The guitar is amazing and the tiny speaking part towards the end is hard hitting and powerful. <br /> <br />Killing Lights is a fun little song, very bouncy. <br /> <br />37MM is amazing, very Depeche Mode.  I loved it upon first listen and love it still. <br /> <br />Endlessly She Said was the only song on the Cd to make me cry.  The raw emotion in Davey's voice, the music, all of it is so heartbreaking and at the same time very angry.  An amazing song and a great way to end the cd. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000M4RG4C|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.. it had some gory parts, but the content was a teaching experience of what our forefathers endured so many years ago... not a typical war movie, and it jumps around a little from what I recall, so pay attention to characters and remember their names.
B000M4RG42|4.0|I was expecting a standard world war II movie: the explosions, the yelling, the confusion, the shaky camera, the best friend dying, and all the other horrors of war brought into your living room. <br /> <br />Although this movie has most of those elements, the main story is about the famous \\"Raising of the flag\\" photograph taken at Iwo Jima, and the surreal lives of the men behind it, who suddenly found that the simple act of getting their photograph taken while raising the flag made them overnight into national heroes. <br /> <br />In my opinion, this makes for a much more interesting movie. Standard war movies certainly have their place to help us understand what the average soldier goes through, but there are only so many of those you can watch, especially after \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Band of Brothers\\", \\"Thin Red Line\\" and all the other war movies we've had in the past few years. <br /> <br />The story of the men behind the flag of Iwo Jima, and how they dealt awkwardly with their newfound fame, is a story that I was completely unaware of before, and one that deserves to be told. (Actually a bit of internet research reveals that this is not the first time their story has been told, but at least it's the first time for our generation. I had no idea before seeing this film.) <br />My internet research also reveals there is a bit of a debate about whether this is a patriotic film or an anti-war film. It is easy to see how you could go either way on this film. It does certainly touch on issues of government propaganda and media manipulation of the war, and one could easily make parallels to the way our government tried to frame the story of the Jessica Lynch rescue, or the Pat Tillman death. <br /> <br />However, politics aside, I thought it was just a really interesting story. And it does make you think about the nature of heroism and the culture of celebrity. <br /> <br />As with a lot of war movies, it is often hard to tell who is who in all the confusion. And the fact that this movie jumps around in time doesn't help. I was halfway through the film before I felt like I had a good handle on what was going on, and who was narrating the story. Some of this was probably intentional, but I think it could have done with better editing just the same. <br /> <br />For me this was one of those movies that I thought was only so-so when I was actually watching it, but once it was finished I found the story really stuck with me and gave me a lot to think about afterwards. <br />
B000NA1VIW|5.0|i'm so glad i bought the 2 movies. I watch them all the time and I probably wouldn't have heard or seen layer cake otherwise.
B00005JPGO|5.0|wow, this was a new awakening movie. It was gory and disgusting for the people in Africa. We are all so stupid, the real cost of a diamond is so cheap. It has all do with greed and take advantage of the human race.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This DVD of Celtic Woman, A New Journey is really very good. Every year I watch the St.Patrick's Day parade from N.Y., being I'm a born and raised New Yorker, but now living in New Jersey, and they opened the parade with total entertainment. I decided to check out Amazon.com and look for a DVD that both my hubby and I could enjoy one day. Well, I spotted this one and its really very good. Anyone interested in pure entertainment would love it, trust me. Once again, I'm very satified with my purchase and always check out Amazon.com when looking for something special. Thanks and keep up the good work. One very happy customer, I am, Maureen from N.J.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is a new CD from this group, and it is EXCELLENT.  It makes for some easy listening.
0714834491|3.0|I guess because this is such a huge book, they had to print on cheap, thin paper or else it would have weighed 100 pounds.  It kind of took away from the designs however .  The paper is a little thicker than newsprint.  I also didn't see why it had to to be sooo honkin' big.  I get the idea that you open the book at random and are exposed to different ideas and designs.  I just thought it could have had a bit of editing as I found many of the designs and ideas repetitive.  There is some interesting stuff here no doubt, but I was just not bowled over.

B000NA28IE|2.0|The Eragon movie (which came out in Dec.of last year) was a huge dissapointment to all fans and box-office numbers. The movie was given horrible reviews by most (if not all) critics. Fans of the book by Christopher Paolini found the movie to be rushed along with characters, plots and chapters missing from the movie entirely.  <br /> <br />For myself, the movie was horrible. If you are a fan of the trilogy, you will find the movie Eragon incomparable to the briliant book. One of my favorite characters from the trilogy (Angela the witch) was only in the movie for less than a minute (and for some reason, was played by Joss Stone?!) <br /> <br />The direction of the movie may be at fault for its blunder. The actors portraying the memorable characters can be found misinterupriting their characters (by the books standards).  <br /> <br />On some high points, the CG's of the movie are up to standard. Saphira is depicted in an acceptable manner. The movie was shot in Eastern Europe, so the land of Algaesia is true to its form.  <br /> <br />The bonus features on this two disc edition include interviews with the author Christopher Paolini, \\"making of\\" specials and cast interviewed. Nothing special sticks out from this \\"bonus,\\" disc.  <br /> <br />All in all, the movie is a let down. I strongly recommend reading the book if you haven't already.  <br /> <br />

B000024C7W|5.0|I was honestly surprised how underrated and underappreciated JOURNEY THROUGH THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS was, upon first release in 1979.  Stevie Wonder, who received glowing reviews for his classic SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE, was riding the high of well-deserved positive musical critiques, and veered off in a new, innovative direction that he hadn't explored until PLANTS.<br /><br /> JOURNEY THROUGH THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS was music composed for a documentary (of the same name) based on what was originally a very engrossing book.  The film celebrated and explored the \\"secret\\" world of plants, their mating habits, interactions and cycles in a way that was previously unexamined in quite the same way in nature films and on public television.  This film sounded fascinating.....unfortunately, it was unreleased to the general public, and remains unreleased today. Except for the two weeks it was in the theatres, and its rare appearances at smaller film theaters, it remains unknown and impossible to find.  Through this beautiful album, we are transported to that secret world.  Wonder's innovative and beautiful attention to detail in his distinctive percussive numbers, that incorporate African-derived rhythms, djembe drum and chants in songs like \\"Kesse Ye Lolo De Ye\\" (on disc 2), Japanese-inspired melodies (\\"Ai No Sono\\") and synthesized dance numbers, illustrating the journey and (even) social life of the plant (\\"Power Flower\\" and \\"A Seed's A Star/Tree Medley\\") are just beautiful.  A song particularly worthy of more appreciation and airplay is the beautiful and haunting \\"Come Back As A Flower\\" (Stevie's duet with Syreeta Wright), and sounds like a life affirming anthem, promoting love, peace and environmental awareness.<br /><br />The lyrics in many of these songs are rich with double meaning, alluding not only to the environment, the life cycles of plants (\\"Black Orchid\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Plants\\"), but also to the African/African-American experience in the world.  The lyrics make reference to appropriation, forceable possession and exploitation.  I truly don't think the critics were ready for Stevie, when he took on such strong subjects.  It's surprising to me, because in SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE, he sang about ghetto life, growing up and the like and the album was received far differently.  I only hope that we one day have the privilege of seeing THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS, the documentary that this music was inspired by.  It couldn't come at a better time.  What's more, the book is definitely overdue for a reissue.  Don't overlook this beautiful album!  It's poetry set to music.reference to appropriation, forceable possession and exploitation.

B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the most amazing movies I've seen. <br />Anime or not, as a movie, the content is very deep. The message that provides in this world where companies just want money and forget about nature's real value. <br />Great to watch with kids too!

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush has been around for over 30 years. In that time they have held to their guns unwaveringly, immovable against grunge, pop, rap, and every fad and trend the music industry threw at them. Sometimes they were nearly successful (\\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Permanent Waves\\" were very successful Billboard albums) and other times virtually ignored. They have experimented with many diverse styles, always with a progressive edge and intent, pushed themselves artistically, written some of the most intelligent, humanistic and philosophical lyrics in modern music, and displayed a caliber and standard of musicianship far above their peers. Due to all of the above, I have always liked and respected them, and look forward to each new Rush release.<br /><br />\\"Snakes And Arrows\\" actually sets a new bar for the band when compared to their last several releases, and sees them moving in an even more exploratory and progressive direction, with dense, layered production, elaborate and complex instrumentation, and a textural and epic approach to songwriting. It takes a couple of spins to sink in, like many good prog albums do, and is one of the most satisfying rock albums of the year. All of the trademark Rush-isms are there; brilliantly thought-provoking lyrics and amazing drumming from Peart, standout vocals and melodic bass themes from Lee, and diverse, varied and textural guitar explorations from the perpetually underrated guitar hero Lifeson....add great production, the wonderful artwork and packaging Rush fans have come to expect from the band, and an epic, progressive vibe sometimes missing from the band's '90s output, and you have an awesome addition to the collection of any fan of smart modern rock. When these guys hang their hats up, it will be a sad day for me......
1582701709|5.0|I bought the book for all my friends and family members. A copy for each family.  At first though, things started to go wrong, they then changed and miracles started happening in my life'  I just had to keep the Secret working in my head. This book is wonderful and you just need to keep in mind what you are told.  Then it really works.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This film is an acknowledged masterpiece.  Kurosawa is a genius of the first magnitude.  I can think of no better way to spend an afternoon than by watching it.  The characters interact flawlessly and you are transferred to a land of ronin and bandits.  The characters are human and their lives are interesting.  You wonder what happens to the remaining three characters.  You know the farmers will always be farmers.
0743496728|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring books I have read.  Jodi Picoult's insight into her characters is awesome.  I found myself understanding for the first time, the impact bullies have on their subjects and sympathizing with the abused and the abusers.  The characters are so finely drawn and my heart goes out to both the perpetraters and their parents who are ordinary, caring well meaning, and loving folk. <br />I could not put this down.
B000I2J2W2|5.0|A brilliant film and a a great chance to see Leslie Neilsen play it straight (well nearly, at any rate).  The film is a classic and was, at the time, a fresh take on an even older classic (The Tempest).  The acting may be a little wooden or hammy overall but that isn't what's importantsince the film itself is wonderfully engaging and introduces us to Robbie The Robot and the over-use of the Theremin for sci-fi sound effects & music. <br /> <br />This HD-DVD is a lovely clean-up job (check out how clean the titles look) and has some interesting extras including a whole extra film (which is quaint but you wouldn't pay for it in isolation). <br /> <br />Overall great fun, good value & a classic reminder of early evening sc-fi re-runs from when I was aged about 5¼!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I bought  this DVD for my grandson who will be two next month.  I know he will enjoy it.

Combining Shakespeare's King Lear with the genius of Akira Kurosawa is good enough for me.  Nearly three hours of exquisite photography and flawless dramatic action leaves no doubt as to the greatness of the director.

It is well written and it makes you think about your own life and the choices you make. Any book that makes you think on higher cognitive levels is a superb choice.  I believe everyone should read this book during their life time.

My 3 year old absolutely loves \\"Peanut Butter Pan\\"  but strange to see some of the Disney spin..like female jealousy from Tinker and the mermaids, Wendy for the Indian maid..weird white male humor with the \\"Redskins\\"?  Little kids only see scary croc, adventure and fun...we have watched it together about 37 times  so I am getting to see a lot of nuances I suppose....
B000MXPE7O|5.0|I am rarely reviewing movies but this one is too good to miss it.<br /><br />In short, a very complex spy thriller, beautifully acted and directed.<br /><br />This is without doubt THE \\"mother of spy movies\\" as a critic justly comments.<br /><br />Get it without second thoughts!!

B000MZHW40|4.0|Es una película muy entretenida, donde constantemente tiene al observador en alerta. Muestra un crudeza y frialdad muy dura que posiblemente existe en algunos paises pero no siempre el espectador está acostumbrado a apreciarla, esto hace pensar y cuestionarse ciertas realidades del mundo. Por otra parte el final es un poco obvio lleganda a alargarse un poco. Las actuaciones en general son convincentes.
0736063684|5.0|This is a fabulous book for planning or modifying weight training workouts. It provides anatomical drawings of about 20 exercises for each body part, highlighting the primary muscles worked. The drawings are excellent, providing a clearer understanding of the muscles worked than either a photo or a verbal description. For each exercise, there is a concise description of how to perform it, as well as pictures of some variations, with explanations of their effect. As over-stress injuries are common, this book explains and pictures the most common injuries and explains how to treat them

B0001Z363W|5.0|This is a great album.  While a little heavier than Zakk Wylde's \\"Book of Shadows\\", this certainly can be considered his idea of \\"SAP\\" or \\"Jar of Flies\\".  This is a great record with some mellow stuff as well as some heavier stuff.  A must have for an Zakk Wylde fan.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Yes, this film completely lives up to the praise it has gotten. Excellent acting, direction, writing, and some amazing cinematography add up to a stunning technical achievement. It also has a story that seems much more relevant than most of what's out there. This'll probably be remembered as one of the top films of the decade. Please see it if you haven't already.
B000OMD4BG|5.0|Many (but not all) of these songs have been circulating on the internet for the last several years, raising the question of whether or not this album is worth the purchase price. The answer is an unqualified yes. Having heard rough cuts of many of these songs, my jaw hit the floor when I heard how beautifully they've been remastered. The songs sparkle and gleam, and hidden complexities of Smith's virtuouso guitar work leap melodically forth from this stupendous collection.  <br /> <br />The often-unaccompanied singing/guitar work of these songs most nearly recalls the work on his self-titled album. These are not second-rate tunes that were dredged up for release - some of these songs are as good as anything he released during his tragically-short career. \\"Angel in the Snow\\", \\"Looking Over My Shoulder\\", and \\"Georgia, Georgia\\" are immediate standouts that will surely join the top ranks of his corpus.  <br /> <br />This is a magnificent parting gift from one of the greatest musical minds of his generation, and an absolute treasure.
B00005JPCF|5.0|The DVD came in amount of days that i paid for, very quick. the movie was in excellent condition, so was the cover. it was almost as if i had bought it totally new, it was still sealed.
0307346609|4.0|When an acquaintance first referred me to this book, the idea intrigued me.  Instead of a narrative story, it's a series of scattered interviews with survivors that take place AFTER the Zombie War is over.  Each story presents new challenges and scenarios that humans had to face, from an international perspective.<br /><br />While the writing is average, the idea behind the book is genius.  In addition, the short interviews and the layout make it easy to read in small increments.  As soon as I started reading the book, I thought to myself \\"This would make a great HBO series\\".  Alas, while HBO did not pick it up, I have since discovered that it is, indeed, on the way to becoming a movie.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to commend the author, Max Brooks, for not overdoing the horror and gore of zombies (though there are certainly plenty of those situations).  Probably half of the stories and interviews present very little or no action/gore at all - allowing the suspense to build up and giving the reader a chance to imagine other frightening images other than mutilated corpses staggering over each other.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This movie was like good comfort food: not particularly nourishing, but great for one of those evenings when you need something cozy, homey and enjoyable.  Rated this chick flick movie 4 stars because of 4 outstanding performances: Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Jack Black and the absolutely wonderful Eli Wallach who was so endearing.  Cameron Diaz was like watching a cardboard cutout playing in a romantic comedy - but the others were fabulous. <br /> <br />The scenery was great with beautiful sets.  Music was fun.  Script was a tad on the predictable side, but so is comfort food! And the little girls who play Jude Law's daughters were simply priceless.  My favorite line in the entire movie was when Jude Law admits to Cameron Diaz that he has a cow in his back yard and he is learning to sew. This was Jude Law at his most likable - just a great fun holiday movie to enjoy over a bowl of popcorn or a cup of hot cocoa.
6305907145|4.0|I wouldn't call myself an Austen purist, but I definitely compare the books with the movies I watch. For purists of Jane Austen's novel, this movie really tears the book apart substituting characters and cutting some out completely. But as a movie, Mansfield Park is one of my favorites. Most of the more recent Jane Austen adaptations really stole my heart in the movie category and this one was no exception. The heart of Jane Austen's story is still there and, as we all know, no one can write about love and romance quite like Jane Austen. <br /> <br />So purists: Beware! Dramatic and Romantic movie lovers: Check this one out!
0515141429|5.0|This was my introduction to Lee Child and I was hooked.  I have read all his Jack Reacher books except for the latest and can't wait to read that.  Lee Child is a terrific story teller who, from all accounts of my friends and relatives, appeals to both men and women alike.

B00005B1W5|5.0|When I first saw this video years ago on PBS, the concert was broken into segments of music clips and PBS soliciting for funds, which did it absolutely no justice.  Truly the magical power that is embedded into this concert increases as you move through it in a continuous fashion.  One can feel the powerful energies of the Taj Mahal as you are embroiled into the music of this concert.  It is a masterpiece of talent from around the globe and imparts to the viewer a peaceful energy of love, appreciation and oneness for all the people of the world.   It brings one into a space of happiness, joy and spiritual reverance.  I can not say enough good things about this concert.  It is a must to own for anyone who is awakening to the powers of the Universe.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I do not usually watch movies like this, full of blood, violence, destruction of countries for profit, but I decided to give it a try and found it to be a provocative movie. The fact that Americans can contribue to the destruction of a country and its people just by buying diamonds was an eye opener of me. We never give a thought to how our buying power will or can affect the rest of the world. I also found it interesting that the market for diamonds is kept artfically high by keeping them off the market. While I recognize this is a movie and may or may not have any truth to it I found it very thoughtful. This is not a chick flick.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|The recording quality, Neil's voice, and his guitar playing on this are awesome.  The video is not much, but who cares.  I like all the songs, as much or better than the originals.  I had not heard \\"Bad fog of loneliness\\" before, its definitely shows Neil's country roots.
0743289684|5.0|This was an amazing book. Most people have absolutely no idea what it is like to be a woman in a muslim world. Itis a real eye opener to the atrocities which still continue on a daily basis. What growing up muslim is truly like for everyone, not just a few extremists. Ayaan Hirsi Ali takes the reader through her whole life journey, simply telling her story of how she finally came to her own truth. <br />Very easy to read, not at all preachy.

1582701709|5.0|Great Book!! From 25 years in nursing I've seen these principles work over and over again. I always knew this was true on some level and have seen it in my own life. A must read for any truth seeker. The Secret was even segmented on a 20/20 special about faith. Read it!
B0000073NC|5.0|You can hear the early talent of the Scorpions shining through on \\"Rainbow.\\"  It is not as commercially known as their 1980's releases, but it is nonetheless packed full of great music driven by intricately woven guitar work around great drumming and vocals.  I began listening to the music on Fly to the Rainbow as far back as 1983...and continue to play it today.  It is definitely a keeper!
B00000255X|5.0|Over and over, I hear that phrase, \\"best Dylan album since Blood on the Tracks\\" used to describe new Dylan albums.  I guess those people haven't heard \\"Desire\\", which is arguably rather better than \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", and came out a year later.  \\"One More Cup of coffee\\"?  \\"Sara\\"?  \\"oh, Sister\\"? Scarlet Rivera's violin? Emmylou?<br /><br />I have all of Dylan's albums.  This is the best one ever, and considering just how good some of those other albums were, that is something very good indeed.  Enjoy.
B00005JPCF|1.0|The cd I received does not have the ability to go to the menu. I don't know what is wrong with it, but it does not look like a real cd movie.
B00006JDSI|4.0|For a film released in 1922, the archivists in Italy did a very good job in their judicious splicing together of the few existing prints of this film (which are of varying quality) to produce the best possible transfer that we shall probably ever see. However, both musical accompaniments have their weak points. Still, I would recommend this film to any silent film fan or discerning fans of films based (or in this case \\"inspired\\") by DRACULA.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is a great positive source to have in your book collection. I reference the book quite a bit.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Esta película parte de un guión muy bien escrito lo que la hace ser una película diferente y muy entretenida. Me gustó mucho que el dvd trae 4 finales alternativos para la película. Recomendada.  <br />

0790731509|5.0|Great Movie, A Must See. Cool hand Luke Is awesome. This was my First Time seeing this movie, and Loved every minute of it. <br /> <br />Five Stars
B000089Q9D|5.0|I believe this is one of the most perfect films ever made. While appearing to be a simple \\"coming of age\\" story it reaches into the depths of human relationships; Mother and child, child and Mentor, Friends, Lovers, Priest and Parish, Idividuals to their community. All of these within the context of Movies, our fears and fantasies made visual. It is a story of courage and of cowardice, of monumental love and devastating loss, Enormous acts and emotions all contained in a small and somewhat insignificant village. This is the story of a community and how it shaped the life of one boy - and sent him out into the world. It is also a love story. And a director's gift of love to his audience [note* I urge you NOT to buy the director's cut of this film it is awful, the theatrical is perfection.]  The last moments of the film are soo touching that I found myself, like toto, laughing and crying at the same time. This film enriched my life, if by reminding me of all the wonderful people I have known and the times we spent together. A Classic film - don't miss it.
1582701709|5.0|I bet is a great book.  I purchased for my cousin that she asked for, she told me to read it first, but I have not had time to do it.  But I have heard that is excellent so I give it 5 stars even that I have not yet enjoy it.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This haunting, magnificent movie has never looked so good. The archivists at Paramount did a fantastic job remastering the film, and the \\"extras\\" are very informative. Highly recommended.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I first saw this movie in original release on the BIG screen.  Since the invention of the DVD I have been waiting for Grand Prix. <br />The wait is finally over, and it was worth it. <br />Beautiful cinematography, a great score, and the cars, oh the cars.
B000KRNCYY|2.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE!!!!  Not nearly as good.
0783229364|4.0|This is a very funny movie.  It is a classic 80's movie.  You have everything from the love stroy to the for the family story.  Micheal J. Fox did a very well job in this movie and so did the other actors.  This is a good movie to watch on a friday night.
B0009X7664|5.0|One of the best movies of all time.  Excellent story, excellent acting, and excellent message.
0765316978|5.0|This is definitely Scalzi's best work. I never thought I'd say this, but his work is on par with Frank Herbert's Dune universe and with a great sense of humor as an added bonus.  He proved that he can write a great story without resorting to casual sex to sell it as in the other books of this series.  I have read all his scifi works and will be on the lookout for his next
B000GIXLO8|5.0|The film shows more detail about what was not shown in the theatrical version.
B000FZETKC|4.0|This movie is a very good teenage love story.  I always get goosebumps when i wacth the movie.  The actors are great and the stroy of two friends falling for each other is wonderful.  If you like chick flicks then this one is a must.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|By far, one of the best romantic comedies in years reminiscent of those performed by the likes of Cary Grant, James Stewart, Kathryn Hepburn, June Allison. <br /> <br />Pure joy, nothing to be offended by. Paramount acting by both Brits and American actors. Quiet portrayal of love lost and love regained within the quaint settings of an English Village and a high-end Los Angeles environment. <br /> <br />Truly a movie to collect and watch on those snowy or rainy nights when the cozy factor is high.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Face paced.  Lots of different locations and you tend to forget it isn't the original Crockett and Tubbs.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Well we'll keep  this short-n-sweet, my boys know to step it up, there is a reason they have been kick'n out the jams for  such a long time..... descent bands come and go but clutch has been and will be here to stay kiddies! So give 'em a listen and become a fan,and for some kick arse reason the more you listen the more you love.
B00005JPCF|5.0|In short, this is a feel good movie.  I simply enjoyed it.  Don't spend a lot of time trying to decipher meaning or social values.  For me, this movie did what it set out to do -- entertain.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|All around great movie, I am not big on the \\"special features\\" but I am a huge White Russian fan.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|One of Martin Scorsese's best picture.  Leonard DiCaprio is brilliant and is the rest of the cast.  Hard to predict and definitely worth watching.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Unique unearthing of subjects which sort have lived in the ether of American thought for the last ten years or so.  Subjects and presentations range from the 'would you please just shut up' to 'that's odd and interesting' variety.  <br /> <br />Good to know that films like this can still be made. Every once in awhile nice to see something for people who enjoy thinking and aren't embarrassed to say so.
B000E1155E|4.0|I saw this CD on many \\"best of 2006\\" lists and picked up a used copy at the music merchant.  I like the pep.  The Monkeys keep you awake.  The thrash of the early tracks gives way to some variety of shading as the CD unfolds.  \\"Riot Van\\" is the only slower track; and it has its tongue firmly in cheek.  \\"A Certain Romance\\" has a jazzy bass part and the edgy lyric, \\"He thinks it's all right to act like a d*ck.\\"  \\"Fake Tales of San Francisco\\" has a killer bass part and vocals full of swagger, \\"I don't want to hear you kick me out.\\"  \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\" is an excellent rocker with stinging lead guitar and shotgun lyrics.  \\"She don't do major credit cards; I doubt she does receipts,\\" opens the lyric about a lady of the night on \\"When the Sun Goes Down\\" before the track explodes as the Monkeys spank out a rocker.  \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\" is an excellent rock & roll CD.  Enjoy!
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I have seen all the James Bond movies and was somewhat skeptical when I sat down to watch Casino Royale. The producers did a fine job of modernizing the Bond character and Daniel Craig represented James Bond with a no-nonsense edge. It was very well done and kept my attention throughout. Highly recommend.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked was a wonderfull play and I fell in love with the music. Living a ways from where they actually have these shows, I can't just go see it again. I thoroughly enjoy this cd, satisfying my needs of that lovely Wicked music.
B0000033J9|5.0|Doctor Zhivago is a soundtrack that goes from soft and slow to thunderous and dynamic.  If you never knew the story, the music would move you to joy and tears with each selection.  From the Overture to Lara's Theme, it is a ride of high and lows.  This is one soundtrack you just put on and close your eyes. It is perfect.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Wonderful performances by Will Smith and his son Jaden.  Based on a true story, this film was well done, well written and fascinating to watch.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|I had it already in LP and want to keep the shwow for as long as I can. <br /> <br />Clovis Jr. - Brazil
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I am a huge Superman fan. And I love the theatrical version of Superman II best of all. But the Richard Donner cut was the biggest disappointment (until Spiderman 3). It was interesting at first, and fun to see a scene that only came out of the screen checks. But the ending was completely disappointing and just made the movie terrible overall. I would give it 1 star, but gave it 2 for historical purposes - it is good to see that sometimes the studios do make the right decisions on movies!
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|HP-12 is a very powerful financial calculator. However, it is little hard to get used to its functions. Mastering the calculator can be a great asset to a Financial Planner as well as a Real Estate professional. I wish there were instructional classes offered for this product.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|My son worships this toy and uses the other characters to act out episodes.
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|The 12cp seems to perform about equally with my previous 12C, but there is a huge downgrade in the quality of the display.  The 12CP display has thinner characters with less visibility in poor light, and most importantly they lose contrast at even a slight viewing angle as compared to a direct 90 degree observation (important when not directly over the calculator, such as on a desktop).  The 12C had a very robust display with great visibility at an angle.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Solid, fast and compact, I have Canon and Nikon cameras, this flash is better than the canon cohort.
039472903X|4.0|This was a great book from an advertising legend. David Ogilvy writes about what makes a successful advertiser drawing from his years of experience. The best part for me was his recommendation to read Tested Advertising Methods by John Caples. Mr. Ogilvy breaks down his advertising method and there are a lot of samples of real advertisements that worked. Even though it was written in 1984 his methodology applies to Internet markeing.
B000MV9026|5.0|I love this movie and enjoyed it so much @ the movie that I took my grand children and saw it 3 times, since getting it from amazon,we have watched it more than 3 times. This is a wonderful family movie and I highly reccomend it for viewing.
B0000067L2|5.0|Anyone who remembers real classic rock from the 60's knows this CD is a must have. It makes it easy in CD form to hear it and has good sound qualty, having been re-mastered. I think it's fantastic to have something from a great band that only lasted a brief time.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This a very sweet and good movie. It is very enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
1883217040|5.0|A valuable tool for understanding how to speak the language of jazz (and music in general) on any instrument.
B00004SA88|5.0|I really enjoy this CD set very much. Accardo is phenomenal in playing violin. I listen to thisevery morning and sometimes while I am cooking.
B000E1155E|5.0|i bought this product because it was a reccomended one by amazon. It was the best of the 3 discs i bought. I would definitley reccommend it to anyone.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|AWESOME! TREMEMDOUS!,  I bought tickets to see the show. My 12 year got this as a gift and now I want a second for myself.  We play it on a daily basis. We also bought the book.The best musical in a long time.
0312323867|5.0|This is the second book in the series and it was just as awesome as the first.  I read this book in less than a week.  It was hard to put down.
074356619X|5.0|This is a life changing movie, book and audio set!!  Anyone who wants to live the Secret should also have this audio book to travel with!
B000IZJZLM|3.0|Quite a romantic music for those who enjoy the genre. But the songs are very alike. Good for driving in the car- I hope in the future they will have more original songs than covers in Spanish and Italian.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|It came as I had expected.  Best James Bond movie since 'From Russia with Love'.  The story was everything that Fleming wrote but seldom was put into the movies that were made.  Craig is good but I like Connery and Brosnan better.
B0000009SG|5.0|It is a pure masterwork, and also a very good introduction to Zappa's music. The band at this period is at its best, the repertoire is fantastic : to get immediately !
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Cannot praise this show enough.  I love it !
B000N3ST7A|5.0|JUST GET THIS CD , YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID !
B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane - the film that showed the world what a film could be.  Decades ahead of its time in terms of camera angles, directorial technique, and a melange of images that criss-cross time in the life of one wealthy and ultimately self-destructive genius, it is easy to understand why this was regarded as Orson Welles greatest screen creation.  Quite simply, Citizen Kane, is a master class in the art of film making.   <br /> <br />Nor are we likely to see its equal again.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|The sweeper is very practical and does the work as they promises on TV. <br />But (and this is big significant but) the charger and battery are made with low quality electric materials. <br />My charger was burned after one use and seems that the butteries will not keep much longer. <br />It is very sad and pity because the idea is brilliant. <br />So my suggestion is wait for a better model. <br />
0743289684|4.0|Although Ayaan Ali is not a gifted writer, I highly recommend \\"Infidel\\" because of its fascinating account of her journey from Muslim fundamentalism to atheism. As an atheist myself, I could not help comparing how easy that jouney was for me with how difficult it was for her. To fully appreciate the difficulty, one has to read the book and learn the horrible things that were beaten (literally beaten) into her as a child. Yet, when she was about thirty, she looked into a mirrow in her hotel room in Greece, where she was on vacation at the time, and said, \\"I do not believe in God.\\" How she got from her childhood in Somalia to that hotel room in Greece is a story that will hold any reader's interest, regardless of the reader's beliefs about religion. \\"Infidel\\" is also a story of exceptional courage, courage at overcoming her fear of Hell (beause of her upbringing, Hell was very real, not just an abstract concept), fear of bringing dishonor to her tribe (Americans cannot appreciate how horrrible this is), and fear for her personal safety (a man with whom she had made a controversial film  about Islam was assinated by a Muslim fanatic). With respect to her personal safety, she will probably have to look over her shoulder for the rest of her life, because, for a Muslim, there is apparently no greater sin than renouncing a belief in God. Ultimately, this is the story of a young girl, who, despite being subjected to brainwashing of the worst kind, never lost the capacity to ask, \\"Why?\\"  <br /> <br />
B000050GQA|5.0|I had heard about this movie. I was bored and so I asked my mom to rent it for me. I'll admit that I wasn't expecting much, but it ended of becoming my favorite movie. Something about it is so inspirational and almost makes you want to be closer to your friends. I'm 14 and was 13 when I saw it. I hadn't noticed the rating till I found it kinda fishy that it would be pg (which I read somewhere). Despite the bad language and gangs it is perfectly appropriate for kids my age and should not be rated R. In fact, I think it is target toward all audiences. I showed my dad whose into horror a sci-fi but he liked it. I'm definitely glad I got the movie.
074356619X|5.0|I watched the DVD of THE SECRET.  The CD set is an amplification of the DVD.  It is a wonderful commute companion, and opens up the DVD ideas by fleshing them out in illustrations and rich details. You cannot listen to these CD's and remain untouched by what you hear.  Epiphany after epiphany with each roll of the wheel as you find you are on two destinations - to get where you are going, and to go where The Secret takes you.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Bought this as a present for my husband - he loves it and listens to it just about everyday on his walkman.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|this series was one of the best i have ever seen.the pictures and film was outstanding.i would highly recommend this series.
B000I5X81A|5.0|the guitar playing by both is fantastic, I would like to see Eric and JJ on tour together, what a concert that would be, imagin!!!!!!!! <br />
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This movie is SMART, sweet, cute, and HILLARIOUS, with great music, great acting, especially Toni Collette (underrated!), and the boy who plays Marcus. I think he has the potential to do big things! Buy this movie-trust me, you'll love it!!! One note--This was a book first and I have it. If you read the book it has a lot of other parts that are missing from the movie and that are hillarious. So, if they didn't cut those parts this movie would have been beyond HILLARIOUS! A big part that is missing from the movie is the bully Ely, who Marcus befriends. I think in the book, they run away after Ely hears of Kurt Cobain's suicide. There's just so many funny parts that weren't included, so read the book too! Nick Hornby makes us laugh while teaching us about life. He is a comic genius!
B000MGUZM0|4.0|This group has potential to break through into the majors - interesting use of instruments and rich vocals. A bit on the dark side but then that is what was intended.
0316166685|5.0|A very good book!!!  It's definitely great since it tells the book through the dead girl's view!!!
B00005JPPL|5.0|Next is a movie based on a classic science fiction theme, the \\"small\\" wild talent. It is based on a short story by Philip K Dick, the great science fiction writer whose stories have inspired numerous movies; works by Dick were also the basis for \\"Blade Runner\\" (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep), \\"Total Recall\\" (We Can Remember It For You Wholesale), \\"Minority Report,\\" and \\"A Scanner Darkly,\\" among others, Nick Cage plays Frank Cadillac, a Las Vegas stage mentalist who can actually see the future; the catch is that he can normally only see his own future, and only 2 minutes ahead. He has made a life living \\"under the radar,\\" exploiting his talent in minor ways, until a rare precognitive glimpse beyond his 2 minute horizon reveals to him the woman that he is destined to be with. <br /> <br />The film is extraordinarily well crafted, gradually introducing the audience to the nature of Frank's power. There is a terrorist nuclear bomb subplot that provides a major plot motivator. With \\"24\\" now in its 6th season, this is already beginning to seem a bit tired as a plot device. Nevertheless it keeps things moving and offers Cage's character a fundamental dilemma: what good is a 2 minute warning against a nuclear bomb? In addition, Frank is being chased by Julianne Moore as a federal agent who has figured out Frank's talent and hopes to use it to find the bomb. I found this to be the one serious plot weakness, in that there is not enough of a backstory to explain how Moore's character has become so convinced that she absolutely must have Frank on her side to stop the bomb. <br /> <br />Initially, we see only the effects of Frank's power as he effortlessly evades capture in some beautifully crafted chase scenes, but as the film proceeds, we begin to become privy to Frank's glimpses of the future. I can't recall whether I ever read the Phil Dick story (The Golden Man) that the film is based upon, but it introduces a type of uncertainty that Dick loved to play with, in thatwe become less and less certain whether we are viewing the actual present or one of the many alternative futures that Frank sees. For Frank, the future has almost a Schrodinger's Cat quality, since just by looking at his future, he changes it. There is a wonderful scene toward the end in which Frank becomes a sort of quantum cloud of alternative Franks working his way through a booby-trapped factory.  <br /> <br />The reviews I saw for this movie were not impressive, but film reviewers have always tended to have trouble appreciating Phil Dick. I thought that it was pretty nearly perfect. The ending, which I won't reveal, might strike some as a bit of a \\"bait-and-switch\\" but I thought that it worked perfectly, because by that time I was very much into Franks mindset in which possible futures become as real as present experience. There is one scene in which Jessica Biehl's character says something like, \\"life should be a surprise,\\" and Frank says wistfully, \\"That would be nice.\\"  <br /> <br />The acting is top notch. Cage clearly appreciates science fiction, and is listed as a producer, and he is very convincing as Frank. Biehl and Julianne Moore round out the strong cast. <br /> <br />Be sure and stay for the credits, by the way; there is a minor joke. <br /> <br />The concept of the two minute warning is a great one, and my only real complaint about the movie is that I'd like to see this idea played out at even greater length. Perhaps Cage will consider producing a TV series with a similar character.
1400103789|5.0|A well researched, interesting, strong argument for athesism.   In particular, I enjoyed the section on the \\"morality\\" of the Bible.
B000O179A4|3.0|Good movie.  Jennifer Hudson is AMAZING!  Eat your heart out Randy, Paula & Simon!!!
0743496728|5.0|Jodi Picoult's latest novel, Nineteen Minutes, is a gripping, powerful story of a school massacre.  The killer is portrayed from childhood as the child in school other children \\"pick on.\\"  He is a loner aware of his status as an \\"oddball.\\"  The reader actually develops an empathy for this young man - until the day of the massacre.. <br />Very hard to put down...
B00005JPAO|4.0|This is an exceptional film.  But, it stars Helen Mirren, so how could it be anything but exceptional.
1582701709|1.0|Here is an exact quote from page 10. \\"Thoughts are sending out that magnetic signal that is drawing the parallel back to you.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to believe the drivel some people write and, worse yet, that some of us purchase. Please take my advice. Don't waste your time or money. Sit down and write up a plan and try to accomplish some of it. Or, failing that, go for a walk. In either case, you'll be better off.
B000M341RI|3.0|I thought with the title saying \\"FULLY EXPOSED\\" that there would be a different ending than the theatrical version.  BOY, what a disappointment!  It was exactly the same!
2913903878|4.0|This is the penultimate guide to ETO gear.  As a ww2 reeneactor it is often hard to tell exactly what's what while sifting through piles of stuff at the local surplus place.  this book is a great help.  the only negative i have is that there are very few pictures of gear in situ, so that makes it hard to tell exactly how a piece was worn/used in the field. <br />
B000O1799U|1.0|Diana Ross,Berry Gordy,smokey Robinson,etc... should be paid for this weak Movie that just takes everything from it. Jennifer Hudson pretty much steals the whole film. Beyonce ain't got a clue at acting.  Jamie foxx is trying to hard and it's mixed. as for Eddie Murphy his many takes on singers and stylings feels like One of his standups,except he is suppose to be playing One,but he can't get One fully right let alone the many he is trying to emulate. the film is too long and it jumps all over the place and it's so cliche and everybody who knows there music history knows this film is about Motown. this Film is a Insult to Motown.  that Corny Broke take on the Jackson Five really took the cake.  this Film was Corny and a straight up slap to the face to what Motown Records Accomplished.
B00005JPGO|4.0|The movie is an interesting look at the diamond trade and how it can fund civil conflicts and create the opportunity for genocide. Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job as the soulless smuggler while Djimon Hounsou is a capable foil for the character.
075640407X|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm military so with not too much time to read it took me a few days to really get started reading this book, but by the time I had made it into the second chapter I couldn't put it down.  I find it hard to believe that this is anyone's debut novel. <br />
B00004XQ83|5.0|Oh Brother if you liked the movie you will love this CD, a great blend of poignant, funny and foot-tapping music.
0062502182|5.0|This book is a great asset for keeping the dream alive.  It is well written and progresses very smoothly and quickly.  A story of a shepard boy who was in search of his dreams to travel, never accepting his birthplace in society.   <br /> <br />The book provides great insight into following your dreams and what those dreams may become.
B0000025VU|5.0|I agree with reviewers who find Infidels to be Dylan's return to from the Christian wasteland of soft lyrics he was lost in for the previous three albums.  And I agree this is perhaps his best album since Blood on the Tracks, and better than several that came since.  His lyrics and voice returned to a sharp critiques and soulful poetry with this album.   <br /> <br />While all that is true, this album to me is something more, and its greatness is not found in its lyrics.  This was the best band Bob Dylan had put together in many years.  Dylan's band for these studio sessions was: Sly Dunbar on drums with Robbie Shakespeare on bass (Bob Marley's Wailers rhythm section), and Mick Taylor on guitar (the blues, rock and roll guitarist who played lead on those brilliant Rolling Stones albums of the early 70's).  Hand this band a backlog of well crafted Dylan songs that were waiting for their day after his brief muted period of Christianity, and you end up with a Bob Dylan who sounds more excited and alive than he had in years.   <br /> <br />This band lifted these songs and produced the kind of driving groove that Dylan's albums had been missing for years.  You can hear Bob's voice and spirits lifted by the groove.  Put this in your CD player, put it on repeat, and leave it there.  You will have a great day.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Absolutely loved this album. Even more than the last one. All the songs bluesy and very Norah-like. Mellow and interesting all the way thru.
6305882592|5.0|Love refuses to accept age and cultural differences as a deterrant. Freedom of thought and spirit can <br />trancend time and space. H & M and the love they have for each other are timeless. It teaches ya!
B0000029PC|5.0|This recording has opened up an appreciation of Schumann that I did not have before. Powerful and expressive performance by Szell.
B0002PUHF6|5.0|They just don't make them like this anymore. This movie belongs in every REAL horror fans collection. The special effects are outrageous, very well done, and Jeffrey combs gives a great performance as well as the rest of the cast. I have \\"bride\\" but haven't watched it yet and I cant wait. Good movie to watch around Halloween.
1582701709|1.0|I've believed in positive thinking from the time I was a child. My grandmother has believed in positive thinking from the time I was a child. She lived a difficult life and so have I inspite of  two degrees. However, If positive thinking is the key as this movie so adamantly states then I should have been married by now, a movie director plus novelist, living in a two story home with children to booth. Am I saying there's no truth to positive thinking being the key. No I am not. But it's only part of the key. If you have positive thinking, but lousy karma, lousy family, and the kua (feng shui related) of your home is horrible, jealous individuals or sabotagers around you on a daily basis( amulets may be needed then, not to mention prayer, fasting, eating healthy,education, positive affirmations etc.)then all the positive thinking in the world will not help you. This movie isn't realistic. The (1) key to having a better life ( my life is improving now) is Feng Shui (is your house aligned correctly) (2) Symbolism -place positive energy or objects that you long to have in your house in certain areas that relate to your specific want or need (3) Work on yourself- affirmations, meditation, positive prayers and whatever negative energy people have sent to you send it back to them and cast it from your aura. People's negative energy ties itself to you and this is what causes you to have bad luck and be depressed. It's not always your thoughts that are causing problems in your life. Also wear an amulet to ward off negative energy and thoughts from others. (4) Wear peaceful colors (colors you find relaxing, not necessarily pastel. Go by the colors you've worn when you were happy, peaceful, won a prize etc.) and listen to soft peaceful music and learn to rest and enjoy nature. When you do this then what you want comes to you instead of you wearing yourself out pursuing it only to receive lost years, grey hairs and a bald scalp. If people follow this \\"Secret\\" book it will only work for those individuals who naturally have good karma, which means they were going to be blessed anyway they only had to have a little belief. But for individuals who've gone through problems all of their lives and have been constantly struggling in life will be disappointed. Because I'm telling you all the positive thinking in the world did not help me in my negative situation. However, the only thing I can suggest for individuals who are truly in negative situations, the best thing they can do is use symbolism, pray, affirmations, fast and meditate. But in my opinion Feng Shui and the ability to control your environment is the key to your success.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This early 70's performance finds an acoustic Neil performing the highlights of Harvest and After the Gold Rush. Neil's vocals are strong and assured. It's almost like sitting in his living room while he demos the songs for you. While the cranked up versions of the songs on After the Goldrush rock harder on the original album, these acoustic versions bring the emotional guts of the songs to the forefront. One suspects that Neil has thousands of hours of similar performances in the vaults at Broken Arrow.  RRR
1401301010|5.0|I'm a huge Anthony Fan and this book gives me an opportunity to see the life behind the man. This book really paints an interesting picture of the life he has lead from childhood to present and it was colorful and the photos are great. Highly recommend this if you are a fan you won't be disappointed, you feel like your on an adventure with him. Love Love Love it!!!!!
B000AY74OG|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie and I have sent it to a frined who also enjoyed viewing it.  Very cute! I loved the Move It Move It song.  I was hilarious at the end of the movie.
B000LRY9PY|5.0|We purchased Corinne Bailey Rae, one week before we saw her in person. What a talented young lady. When I think of Corinne Bailey Rae, she defines CLASSEY. Her performance in person speaks volumes. We didn't have the best seats in the house, however, if she comes around again, we will be sure to see her.  BUY THIS CD, you will really enjoy it. She is like a breath of fresh air to the music industry.
0679746323|5.0|This book opened my eyes to the true nature of Mao -- a truly evil, power hungry tyrant willing to kill tens of millions of his own citizens for his own self-interest. It seems from my readings of the past 30 years that that is what it takes to truly make Communism \\"work\\".
0151012768|5.0|A marvelous romp of a transformed salaryman, under the guise of an improbable project. A good read, well crafted.

B000KRNCYY|4.0|I'm a big fan of live DVD's for just about any music genre so this is no exception.  I must admit that while I do like this title, their first production (smartly performed inside) made the bigger impression on me.  While the girls still did a great job, the cool evening weather just barely affected them I think.  If I can see their breath on video, they must have been cold.  The song selection remained varied.  Still Irish in nature, not as many tracks as in the original would be 'recognized' by the casual listener.  That's okay though, after all a sequal often is intended for the avid fan who already is fancied with the group.  Then again I may just be fancied with Lisa  ;-)  Either way, I was happy with the purchase and having it as an addition to the collection.  You will too!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|As soon as we saw this movie in the theaters my kids asked me to buy it when it comes out on DVD..so we did..loved this movie!

1933784032|5.0|Very nice quality book with large quality, color close ups.  Very interesting insight into the model making and figure sculpting used in the making of Star Wars series.   <br /> <br />Only regret is not all of the models are covered and not enough multiple view, but that would require a series of books not just the one.
B000FIMG68|5.0|There are plenty reviews commenting on the content already. However, I'd like to comment on the price. In other countries, Germany in my case, Lost is being sold in two-box sets for one season. One set costs more than the complete season here at [...]! This is a very fair price and delivery was very quick and the packaging was also very thourough so that no damage could come to the product - even sending it overseas.
0151012768|5.0|It is not often now that you read a book so enjoyable. Humorous, interesting, creative, totally outside the standard commercial formula for current best sellers.
B000GY729M|5.0|This is the best of the lot! I love the Killers and their music is out of this world! I hope that they can top this on their next CD!
0743496728|5.0|This book is so well written, it held my interest from page one to the last page.  I found myself at odd times reflecting on the story.<br /><br />Well done Jodi Picoult.  One of your best books, and I liked them all.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|When I thought it was not going to be possible to do another Rocky movie, here comes one that Rocky pulls off nicely.  Even my teenage nephew enjoyed it.  Kudos to Stallone
B0002OXVDW|5.0|The best collection of scenes from various MGM musicals over the years available without a doubt. This first \\"That's Entertainment\\" is much longer than I thought but features many favorites scenes from a wide variety of MGM musicals. It is hosted by a wide variety of stars (including Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.) And a great part is it was shot on the now non-existent MGM Back Lot (most of what you see in the wraps no longer exists.) Parts 2 and 3 include more scenes from various films and a few different perspectives - part 3 shows how well rehearsed Fred Astaire would be with his dances.) If you like movie musicals, this collection is a MUST!
B000N3SS80|3.0|I have always been a fan of JLo's music. I grew up in the disco era and her previous cd's have been charged with that classic dance club sound that I love. This is obviously a departure from that, but unfortunately, it fall flat and doesn't deliver. Que Hiciste, the most upbeat song, is one that I really like and comes closest to what her fans expect but it sticks out like a fish out of water on this collection. All the other songs are classic Telenovela-style ballads that I remember hearing on my grandmother's radio growing up. These ballads were meant to be sung by STRONG vocalists. Clearly Lopez struggles when the songs are in the high range,she should stick to lower range songs, that can ultimately shown more emotion in a singer's voice, (think of Marlene Dietrich's sultry tones) Sounds like she's trying to mimic her husband Marc Anthony's style, and that is her fatal mistake with this cd. I admire her attempt, but it IS too little , too late. If she had released an all Spanish album earlier in her career, it would have been more meaningful to her fans and established her commitment to her Latin roots. Releasing this now makes it seem like she's just doing it to appease those who would accuse her of ignoring her heritage in favor of coasting on her romantic comedy appeal to movie audiences. Her recent appearance on American Idol just proves how weak her voice is, you can clearly hear the background vocals singing along with her, so that you never hear her own voice cleanly. I was hoping this cd would have some tropical salsa style songs, which would have gone better with her vocal style and reached a wider audience. As further proof that this cd was a mistake, my boyfriend (who liked this album more than I did) went to buy it at the Virgin store, here in New York, and this cd was in the $10.00 SALE BIN! Just three weeks after being released!
B000N3T0DM|5.0|The Blu-Ray release of this movie further brings to life one of Pedro Almodovar's warmest films up to this date.  Penelope Cruz's performance is one of her best, and the supporting cast is wonderful!  The film to video transfer is flawless with an superb soundtrack. A real treasure of a film to have in one's collection.  [[ASIN:B000N3T0DM Volver [Blu-ray]]]
B000O178BY|5.0|This is the album that I thought, With Teeth, was going to be. Year Zero, is in the tradition of Pretty Hate Machine, however, it has a new raw electronic edge and the production is extremely Neve / API forward and punchy and thick. It really has a depth in the synth textures and drums when compared with the production of Pretty Hate Machine, which sounds far less produced. Year Zero is so lush and buttery sounding which lends to Trent's subtle programming genius and subtle over-dubbing fingerprint. I read somewhere that he used like 9 samples of a David Bowie drum kick for the kick drum sound on The Downward Spiral's \\"Closer\\". Everything stands out on this record. It's absolutely Pop genius songwriting and production.  <br />Perhaps NIN will remaster PHM for us, eh? So we can really hear the way it is supposed to sound ... you know, like, live! I saw NIN at Irving Plaza for an unannounced gig and it was tremendous. The sound was over the top. That's what this record sounds like. Just \\"right there\\".  <br /> <br /> <br />To my ears, this is where trent might have gone after Pretty Hate Machine had he not become famous. Absolutely Brilliant.  If you're into electro/industrial/EBM etc. buy this record. You will not be disappointed. It's really great.  <br /> <br />Side note: I'm hoping that the next record picks up where the Downward Spiral left off ... somewhere in the art noisey production of Steve Albini and the intensity of Flood's engineering, both of whom worked on that record with him.
B000006NX5|5.0|Anything that's Barry White has to be good. I love his style and way to bring music into the bedroom.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|After seeing the previews for this movie, I thought it looked like the typical Hollywood BS of blowing things up and killing eveyone in their wake.  I was VERY wrong.  I guess it lends itself to an update of the cliche: Don't judge a DVD by its cover.  This is a wonderful story in the simplest form of good versus evil.  It is well acted and the special effects are perfect in the context of the storyline.  It has the quality story of an indy film with the budget and productions of a major film.  It is a keeper.
1577314808|5.0|I found this was what I needed to read NOW.  It is not a hard read, and makes so much sense.  The author did a good job on what could possibly be a difficult subject to grasp.<br /><br />Still reading and taking time to pause and reflect on the material.
0399226907|5.0|This book belongs in every home library.  And it must be the board book, as there are many little holes in the pages that little fingers MUST be put into.  We always give this as a gift to first time parents.<br /><br />The story is a great intro to the natural world as well as counting and identifying many foods.  THe story has so much to teach!  The art work is fascinating as well!  Check out Eric Carle's other books as well.  You are sure to find many more to love.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This film is MUCH better than the theatrical release (which I liked a lot).   There is a lot more cohesion and apparently peripheral characters like Foggy Nelson, even Bullseye, get much more screen time in this version.  It's a shame this wasn't the version that came out in the cinema.  Maybe we would have been spared the dross that was Elektra..... <br /> <br />Anyway, great film, far superior version.  Buy it. Definitely.
0374105235|5.0|[[ASIN:0374105235 A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier]]  I saw Ishmael Beah on the Daily Show with John Stewart and was moved to read this book.  I don't usually read memoirs, but this book was a beacon of hope that needed to be heard.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|A handful of songs work for me..the best are the three instrumentals. In fact I think this would be a superior collection minus the vocal track as there is a LOT of fantastic musicianship and \\"bones\\" here that are handicapped by attempts to put melody to an unmusical and unworkable lyric set. The dreary, negative and ponderous lyric lead to an overall lack of structure and melody that takes the overall effort incomplete, taking it up sideroads with no destination, a foundation with no mortar.  <br /> <br />With the exception of the openning Far Cry track I think the latter half of the cd works best, finally building a bit of energy and cohesion.  <br /> <br />Overall an ok release; its wonderful to hear these three veterans making music again.
0743496728|5.0|I was assigned this book for book club last month and I was half way through it when the Virginia Tech Shootings took place. It was so real to life that as I read and listened to the news I felt like I was mixing fiction with reality. Shocking and sad was the ending. I fear that things that happened in the book happen in real life too often.
B000056BOR|5.0|I loved this movie and all the actors in it.  It's very cute and funny and I would recommend it to others.
1596680199|5.0|I love looking through this book to give me ideas for my caning. If you are going to make a bead using polymer clay you NEED this book It's terrific!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|It is a good documental, I believe that it shows the reality of what can happen if we don't change our lifestyle.   <br />The only bad is that it combines some politics inside the documentary.
B00005JO9J|4.0|I've read some reviews that call it a soap opera posing as high drama. and I can't disagree, but I think it is very well done.  The characters are well defined, warts and all, and they stay in character despite the grueling pace of their jobs. Each episode is very well plotted and the medical problems and procedures are believable and involving. Although the sex lives of the staff seem a litle too casual and open, that may be just a reflection of my own advanced age and outdated attitudes.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Great movie, very witty. All actors were terrific and strong in their roles. <br />Worth watching numerous times to pick up on all the cleverness. Happy it won <br />for best director. Fast pace & exciting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just another 5 star rating to lament one of the only watchable shows that's been produced in years...
B00005JM8V|5.0|Director Claude Lanzmann purposefully chose not to show any horrific footage of what the Nazis did to the European Jews (such images he deemed as a kind of pornography).  Instead, SHOAH is nine hours of imagery involving interviews with both victims and perpetrators, and curious images demonstrating how Nazis even managed to violate 'nature'.  Horrific and brilliant.
