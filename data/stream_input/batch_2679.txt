B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My daughter like all the Temple Run games. I have not spent much time playing them as she has but if a game can keep her attention more than 20-ish minutes, I know she likes it.
0307730700|5.0|This is an inspirational, against all odds kind of book.  I wish it to be read by everyone at the earliest age, boys, girls, men & women.  Everyone will take away something to admire about Adam Brown, his wife, his children, his family.  You will know the purpose for his place on this earth because millions will benefit from it.  I am honored to be related to him.
014242918X|4.0|In his own words, John Steinbeck called Of Mice and Men a \\"playable novel.\\"  He wrote the novel in defined scenes that could be easily acted out just as they are written, with very little editing.  In fact, Of Mice and Men was developed into a play soon after its publication in 1937 and it was that play, along with the subsequent movie, that made John Steinbeck a household name.<br /><br />I liked this audiobook a lot.  You just can't help but feel for Lenny, and I always find myself wishing things could have turned out better for him.  Steinbeck uses his believable characters to discuss such topics as loneliness, the callousness of the world, and the importance of taking care of your own.<br /><br />Mark Hammer did a fine job in his narration of Of Mice and Men.  He's not a master of voices, but he matches the speech of the characters nicely.  His interpretation of Lenny was particularly convincing.<br /><br />This audiobook has some important lessons for us all, and also provides an insider view of a piece of American history and culture.  Of Mice and Men is highly recommended.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She just started really playing with Barbies and I wanted something cute to put the Barbies in. This is great because you can unzip the sides and she can play with her Barbies on a mat that has different scenes on it. The only thing that I wish it had was somewhere to put the shoes, etc. I am just using baggies to hold accessories. It's light so she can carry it herself. This was a good buy!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander MD, a brain surgeon with twenty five years of surgical practice, including fifteen years on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. He had never read a book on near death experiences (NDE) and as an agnostic had never believed in heaven. He devoted himself to science. At the age 54 of he was struck down by a lethal form of ecoli menengitis that sent him into a coma for seven days. During that coma he had a visual experience of heaven and the presence of God.<br />  When he recovered - very few with that condition recover - he told his son that he wanted to write about his NDE experience. His son wisely advised his father that if he was to write about it, he should not read a single book or article that others had written on that topic. There are many books and articles that have been written by others. He completely agreed. This book comes only from his inner-life experience of crossing the boundary of dying and coming back.<br />  I found this book deeply moving. As a priest of 56 years, I have always believed in a life after death, but have never had a thought of what heaven is like except that God is in charge and that none of us are lost to God. However skeptical you might be, this book is worth reading to open a window on a more  profound and hopeful dimension of Life.<br />Rev. Clarke Oler
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I liked the movie, but it left me feeling like something was missing. Like, a solid ending. I hear there may be a sequel, so maybe that will tie up the loose ends.

B005IQZB14|4.0|What a brave woman this author must be to set out on an 1100-mile trip on foot alone while carrying an extremely heavy backpack!  The author shares with us her feelings, emotional and physical, while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in temperature extremes.<br /><br />  My back ached as she struggled with her weighty back pack, my feet and toes hurt as she described her blisters and blackened toenails.  I was thirsty when she was thirsty and felt guilty even thinking of a snack when she described her hunger.  I was disappointed when she could not get the box she had expected to pick up at the post office and when the box did not have all the contents it should have had.<br /><br />  The book was so interesting that I forgot to keep track of any typos, misspelled words, subject/verb disagreements, and other similar items that I usually find so annoying.  However, there was one annoyance that I could not overlook - the author's extensive dropping of the f-bomb.<br /><br />  I wish this author and other authors along with their editors and publishers would consider going back to the comic book way of swearing in print.  I do not need to know the exact swear words and would much prefer seeing  !@#$%&*  to the actual swear words.<br /><br />  Perhaps the Kindle version could give readers a choice of seeing the actual swear words or the comic book type of swearing.  Another Kindle improvement would be showing the percentage of the book reached when beginning each chapter or section.  The percentage could be shown instead of the page numbers in the Table of Contents or Index.  Another table showing a conversion of percentages to pages would be helpful for book discussion groups that have some people who prefer Kindle books and some who are sticking with the hard copies.<br /><br />  Now that I have hiked the Pacific Crest Trail vicariously by reading this author's words, I plan to read more books about long-distance hiking.  While I realize that I will miss the true experience of hiking in the great outdoors, I will not be losing any of my 70-year old toenails.

1416550550|5.0|This book was so good that I forgot to keep track of any typos, subject/verb disagreements, or other things that generally annoy me. Perhaps there were none; I do not remember any of those items.<br /><br />  The author did a very good job of telling the stories of three women across the span of four generations and how the lives of earlier women affected those which followed.<br /><br />  After reading the book, I learned that the author drew on several experiences from her own life and that of her grandmother to compose the book.  However, the author did not hurry the book; she waited until she could assemble the various pieces into a compelling story.<br /><br />  As I read this book, I thought that I was solving the mystery.  However, the author gave her readers just the right amount of information to come close to solving the mystery without the readers being sure everything really fit.<br /><br />  Moving from one character in a time period to another character in a different time period and then a third set was confusing for the reader, but the author was justified in using this device to link the characters. The author gives her readers a map of the estate on her web site; it would have been helpful if the map had been included in the book itself.<br /><br />  I hope the author continues to write books that are so delightful to read.  By the way, she gets bonus points for not dropping the f-bomb.  I wish other authors would follow her example.

B009IH0ICG|5.0|EDIT: fixed my calculations for volume<br /><br />For my grill the easiest way to control the heat (225F for long smokes) is to limit the fuel. I have a full size chimney and found myself only filling it to 1/3 full (33 Kingsford Original briquettes). I decided I wanted half that and found that so few briquettes didn't catch on fire as well. I use the Minion method of using the lit coals to light unlit coals over time. So, the question is does this smaller compact chimney starter work for 15-20 briquettes?<br /><br />Here are the numbers: The full size chimney starter is 12 inches high, 7.5 inches in diameter. The interior cavity is 9 inches deep. There is an internal grate that provides air space under the charcoal about 1/4 of the way up from the bottom. It's conical in shape but I'm ignoring that; I don't think it makes much difference. Total volume is 126.6 cubic inches (or about 2 liters).<br /><br />The compact chimney starter is 8 inches high, 5.75 inches in diameter. The cavity is 6.25 inches deep. The total volume is 51.7 cubic inches (or 0.85 liters).<br /><br />1 full compact chimney starter fills the full chimney starter to 1/3 (33 briquettes as it happens). This is going to be perfect for me. With my usual load of 15 briquettes they didn't even cover the whole bottom of the full sized starter.<br /><br />I made this measurement because briquettes aren't fluid and don't flow to fill all available space. I was concerned that the briquettes would not pack as well into a smaller volume.<br /><br />There is some discussion of the compact chimney starter not firing up coals as well. The volume beneath the coal grate that allows air in is smaller than the volume beneath the full size chimney starter. That's obvious. I just lit a 15 briquette load. Fifteen minutes, same as the larger starter. The charcoal in the compact starter is more uniform gray and better started. I think this is because a small load stacks better in the compact starter and you get more of the chimney effect. In the larger starter, they don't even cover the bottom. Since I don't intend to light more than about 33 briquettes I'm better off with the compact starter.<br /><br />If you need 50 or more briquettes to get your grill going the compact chimney starter is too small for you. If you are invested in the Minion method or in using a charcoal fuse or snake (look it up) then the compact chimney starter might be just what you need.<br /><br />When I'm doing a long smoke I have to add coals every hour or so. The small chimney is great for adding lit coals to a waning fire. Adding unlit coals produces too much smoke and takes too long to get the temperature back up if it dropped.<br /><br />2014/08/09:<br />I tried the small chimney starter with lump charcoal and I have to agree with Chris. It is too small for something as irregular as lump charcoal.the chimney effect. In the larger starter, they don't even cover the bottom. Since I don't intend to light more than about 33 briquettes I'm better off with the compact starter.<br /><br />If you need 50 or more briquettes to get your grill going the compact chimney starter is too small for you.

I am tiring of the back and for of the love interests but there were several surprises in who were good guys and who were not.

B00B769XB8|1.0|I don't see what people liked about this movie. It is stupid and mindless to say the least. I enjoy action movies but this was just plain stupid. Save yourself some money and 2 hours of your life and skip this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie Despicable Me. I saw and loved Despicable Me 2. So I knew I would love this app! And I was right! It's basically a mix of Temple Run and Subway Surfers, two of my favorite games, so I really enjoyed it. Great time-killer for Despicable Me fans!!<br /><br />10-08-2013 EDIT:<br />Okay, I meant to add this sooner, but this game and other Gameloft apps freeze my Kindle Fire. Unless I had all WiFi bars, the game froze and I had to wait for my Kindle Fire to run out of battery and then plug it back in and blah blah bah. This problem may or may not occur on your device.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|Based on real-life events, this movie gives an account of the impact on the personal lives of those involved of the WMD episode in the Bush administration. President Bush Jr. was so obsessed with invading Iraq to finish the war that his father had started that he fabricated the story that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. CIA operative Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) is sent to Iraq under cover to find out the truth. She persuades several of the Iraqi physicists involved in the program to defect to America. She makes it clear back home however that there are no WMD. Her partner, Joe Wilson (Sean Penn), writes a newspaper article about the fiasco but in return the administration discloses Valerie's identity and the nature of her mission. The Iraqi physicists are abandoned to their fate in Iraq and they are rounded up and executed. The chief `hawk' in the administration is Scooter Libby (David Andrews) who subsequently stands trial for his part in the fabrication, and is sentenced, but has his sentence revoked by the president. The movie is an exciting dramatization of events, directed by Doug Liman. This deplorable story has been told in print by those concerned: `Fair Game' by Valerie Plame Wilson and `the Politics of Truth' by Joe Wilson.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it works very well and is easy to bring. i like it. i will recommend this produce to my friends.
B00C6B9976|1.0|It tries to play both roles as a comedy and science fiction but it falls flat on its face.  I liked other movies like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, but this movie just never clicked.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read about 6-8 books a month and this was a best.<br />It helps if you have been in the military, especially combat, to understand the funny side of the book. It is intense in many parts and for those who can't or don't take to a REAL life experience, as opossed to the phoney reality programs on the TV, then don't read it. Real life isn't so easy and retrievable.
1449437524|5.0|A wonderfully-written funny, yet poignant tale of man's best friend! You'll laugh and you'll cry, but you'll love it! Whole-heartedly recommended!

B001DM1VXE|1.0|It almost felt like I was on some sort of hallucinogenic &#34;trip&#34; through most of this movie, never quite knowing which parts were supposed to be real, and which parts were supposed to be the hallucinations/delusions of the character.  I kept waiting for something to tie it together, and it never came, and suddenly it was over - without being over.  Perhaps I just didn't &#34;get&#34; it, but in the end I found no value whatsoever - entertainment, meaningful social commentary, even socially redeeming.  According to the credits, the &#34;star&#34; (if it's even right to call him that) was also one of the writers, which then suggests this was just a piece of self-indulgent catharsis, or exhibitionism, or even a function of his own psychotic mind.  Award winning?  What were they thinking!?

B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Sorry, but I just couldn't stay with the plot to get far enough to understand it. It was a long reach from the previews. What I mistook for exciting action, turned into &#34;helter-skelter&#34;. Just my opinion...take it or leave it. Normally, I love movies, especially Tom's. I will say, the makeup & costumes/sets were out of this world, literally.  Maybe someday I'll give it another try,if I don't have to pay for it again.

Interweaving British, American, German and Russian characters into a flawless framework for intrigue and emotion, Ken Follett matches the skills present in his previous  works.

B008JJM88Q|1.0|It is a nice app but it  requst a lot of non sense permissions and several ads that not make sense for a paid app.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun game when your stuck somewhere and are trying to pass the time. I gave it four stars only because it is actually kinda hard to play for a long length of time without having to start over. I get killed a lot.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Nivce game with good visuals but it could be improved a little more for high definition screens.  In my Nexus 10 it doesn't look as sharp as it could.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun and challenging! i couldnt put it down...cant wait for more levels! a few levels were a little tougher than usual but def gets your brain cranking
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I was a big fan of the HBO show, and I really enjoyed the movie, loved the fashion the girls wears. If you are a fan of the show you will like the movie to see what happens to Carrie and Mr. Big.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The style is classic, yet snazzy. My 2 year old often asks to listen and dance to this. Plesant to listen to just about anywhere.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan, Pride and Prejudice is one my favorite books. the movie is great I prefer this version better than the others.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Nesbo's books always have interesting plot twists and turns. His characters are interesting and usually more complex than other writers. I like the fact that Nesbo doesn't always provide obvious conclusions. that sometimes the good or handsome/cute character comes in last. This book provided some interesting info on Australian culture and provided some extra problems for Harry Hole. I thought the ending was weaker than his other books or I would have gone for a 5. Nesbo and Ace Atkins are for and away the best detective novels available and both provide the best entertainment for the buck. The translation , as always was excellent. As always, this was a enjoyable and thought provoking read. Rgds
0920668364|5.0|I purchased this book for my dad when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer.  This book isn't just perfect for children, it's perfect for adults as well.  My grandmother passed and my dad still gets it out to read it!  Love this book!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading this series and I still feel it's a worthy read. There are moments when the main characters are a little annoying, but for the most part they truly do love one another through thick and thin..
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this app looked really fun, so I got it. every time I tried to open it though, it told me I wasn't allowed
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|A great cast, a good plot and movie that actually makes sense.<br /><br />This is a movie you will want to watch a second time. I have seen it 3 times and still enjoy it.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|I'm not much of a Nicholas Sparks fan, I admit he's a good writer, but I was never much into all of his love story themes and plots. However, with that said, the Notebook is a book/movie that I could read or watch over and over and over again. Beautiful story!
B009AMANBA|4.0|Generally when you combine all of the talent that was put into this movie, you can reasonably expect to get a good outcome.  The contribution of the actors playing the various characters in this movie overshadowed the story itself.  The academy did a great job in how they recognized talent this season in the way they dispensed the awards.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This escape game was one of the most fun that I've played. It was challenging at times, but I never needed a walkthrough or tips. The fact there there were multiple levels makes it more entertaining and fast paced. The fact that it was free makes it 100% worth it off you like (good) escape games.

031262820X|5.0|When I read the title and the brief little synopsis before purchasing the book, I was expecting a cute little summer read.  A sort of a romp of a story through wedding planning, bridesmaids, just a silly little story.  What I got was a much deeper, reflective story on secrets and the effects of hiding our true selves from the world.<br /><br />Milly Havill had a fun summer ten years prior with two good friends.  Her actions to try to help someone, come back to haunt her at a time, when it really matters.<br /><br />Fast forward ten years and Milly is preparing to have the wedding of the century to the son of one of Britian's most successful businessmen.  Simon Pinnacle seems a bit of a perfectionist and Milly, who adores Simon, is willing to remake herself to fit Simon's perception of her.<br /><br />Milly's mother, Olivia is caught up in the wedding preparations and the idea of being connected to the Pinnacle family.  She also runs a successful bed and breakfast and it sounds as if she is truly a great hostess making certain her guests are well cared for when visiting.  James, her husband is an accountant.  He is beginning to feel lost, as if their lives together have grown apart and they are heading on separate paths.  James wants more.<br /><br />Isobel is the older sister, a successful career girl, blazing trails and making her parents proud.  Until she discovers that her life is taking a huge turn.<br /><br />Harry Pinnacle is Simon's father.  Harry abandoned Simon's mother when Simon was young.  Without his wife, Harry became successful in business.  Simon, has been trying to best him and make a way for himself.  One thing is certain is that Simon is certain that he will definitely best his father in the love and family area.<br /><br />Rupert, is one of Milly's former friends from ten years prior in Oxford.  Rupert was uncomfortable.  Rupert set out to remake himself, but has he been truly happy?  His current life requires some reflection and decisions, whenMilly comes crashing back in to his life, looking for their mutual friend Allan.<br /><br />Alexander is the photographer, back in Milly's life, after ten years, ready to photograph the wedding of the century.  However he knows Milly's secret and teases her about it.<br /><br />Esme is Milly's beloved godmother.  She is always there to comfort, console and support Milly.  But, is she truly as wonderful as she seems?<br /><br />This story examines the secrets and winding and unwinding of lives.  How sometimes, we remake ourselves to make ourselves attractive and acceptable to others.  How sometimes we lose our way to our true selves in a search for happiness.  Then, only to wonder are we truly happy as we are now.<br /><br />Don't get turned off by this title.  And, don't expect a sweet summer read.  Do, however, read this book for an examination of how some people discovered who they truly were and find themselves back to redemption.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this game is very addictive once you get the hang of it you really have to pay attention to what you chose for battle or you will get slaughtered like nothing funny.
B0026PW67W|5.0|My nephew had seen one of the Harry Potter Marauder's Maps and had it at the top of his birthday wish list.  After much research I ordered it and had it shipped to me before wrapping it up.  It came on time and looked like what I had seen/heard about and when my nephew opened his gift I knew instantly that it was exactly what he wanted. He/we couldn't be happier!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Wish all of your horses could interact and the advertisements are always a bummer. Aside from that it's a pretty good app.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Loved it then bought it then wife took it to play it.I will beat this thing with every deck. Can't wait to unlock everything.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I think this book was even better than the first book! This book brought me to tears and had me bouncing up and down with happiness! I can't wait for the next book!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This is one of the best movies made in a long while. I love the creativity behind it and the story. It's great.
B003E8AF5U|4.0|I had avoided this record for awhile because I heard so much mixed opinion on it. I knew it wasn't like their last one so I gave it some time. This album stands on its own and is solid from start to finish. Give it a listen.
B003INBOE2|5.0|This story is based on true facts... Bruce lee's teacher, historic hero. Watch it you won't regret it if you like Kung Fu, and Donny Yebn's acting is superb, not to mention that the actor himself actually knows these martial arts, puts the quality of king fu and acting in this film higher.
B00000IQW5|5.0|We watched this movie the Friday before the Yarnell Hill fire that took the lives of 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots on Sunday, June 30, 2013.  These men had just fought at the Doce fire north of Prescott, AZ a couple of weeks prior.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Just finished reading all 850pages.<br />Loved that Jake/George got to see Sadie even though she didn't remember him.<br />Great ending
B0037UUZQY|4.0|My daughter is very into Disney Princesses and I stumbled on the package at Target that included all of them but it had terrible reviews on how the dolls held up. I opted for this series through Amazon and we couldn't be happier with them. This one is her favorite and she has the Rapunzel hair salon to go with it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I like the size and layout of the backpack.  For the price it is great.  I dragged it around the UK as a part camera/part personal bag.  It got some wear and tear and here are the following:<br /><br />1.Part of an inside pocket is coming apart.  So far not bad enough for me not to be able to use it.<br />2.A strap on the outside came off.<br /><br />What I would LOVE on this bag is an outside pocket for a water bottle.  It is a no-no to stuff a water bottle inside with camera equipment in case it leaks but there is no-where in this bag to put one.  The elastic on the front doesn't hold the water bottle.  It is find for a light weight jacket or sweater but no heavier.<br /><br />Another feature is something a little more heavy duty to strap on a tripod on the side.  There is the strap that got ripped off.  Maybe my tripod is just too heavy and I can modify the backpack.<br /><br />For the money, layout and construction, it is worth it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We rented this after a USA Network Season 9 marathon left us hanging - we weren't disappointed!  This is the first television episode we've ordered through Amazon, I was impressed by how easy it was.  Picture quality was great and NO COMMERCIALS!  (YAY!)

B0029LCJJS|5.0|Excellent show with a great cast and very well acted.  You get caught up in the story and it is a little overwhelming when you realize these 'characters' were real people in history!  Very well done show!
B0063IH60K|5.0|LOTS of fun for the whole family!  It works well on all of our devices, computer and tablet. I have not tried it on my cell phone.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Excellent cast of historical characters!  Well acted, and very believable!  Really enjoyed all seasons!!!! I may have to sit down and watch it again on Amazon Prime!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My 2 year old neice loves this game. She will spend hours of I let her playing it.  In fact after installing this one I had to put a time limit on the kindle for her or I would never have a chance to read my books. It is very well done and engaging to her.  Love it well worth the 2 or 3 dollars I spent on it.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|better than expected, easier than going out to the movie store to rent, cheaper than on-demand rentals from the cable company
B006LSZECO|4.0|While my brother was visiting last week, I downloaded this book on my Nook after seeing it topping charts for weeks and getting fantastic reviews. This was my first time reading a Gillian Flynn novel, and I must say, I'm sure it won't be my last.<br /><br />It is so unique for me to find a book that can grab me by the very first page, but this book did just that. Opening on the day of his wife's disappearance, you're instantly thrown into Nick's world and mind, witnessing the current events through the eyes of his failing marriage and changing opinions of his wife. This book was such an absolute roller coaster! Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ending was a HUGE let down for me. I felt as though I had gone through this emotional journey and flip flopped back and forth over who I thought the killer was - and then - the whole story just dropped. Maybe some found it poignant, but I didn't. I just felt let down.<br /><br />However, considering how much I enjoyed the rest of the book, I'd be more than willing to give Gillian Flynn's addictive writing style another try.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have loves Neil Gaiman since I first read Neverwhere 12 years ago.  His fantasy is of an ilk that you almost believe it could truly happen. Ocean at the end of the Lane is just like that. And n typical Gaiman style, he leaves you wanting more.  Fantastic read.  I will be reading this again.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  So glad that I have it on my Kindle Fire.  I take it everywhere with me.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Incredibly clever and creative production.  Captured the interest of my three year old granddaughter, all without words!  Very well done.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was both riveting and frustrating at the same time. The book got off to a pretty slow start and then just shy of halfway through, it really began to move. Both of the main characters were well developed but maintained enough mystery to surprise you. However, from the beginning, I saw through Amy's character and was beginning to get annoyed by the way the townsfolk were siding with her over Nick- who was equally flawed yet somehow more likeable- at least for me. I guess I have grown weary of female \\"victim\\" do often portrayed in media. Anyway, there were a few plot twists that literally blind-sided me and a few I saw a mile away. The ending left me a bit dissatisfied as I expected more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its fun but why when you get your horse to a high level to pop up ads start to come up?
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Reminds me of a homework assignment in college that I waited to the last minute to complete.  I remember saying to myself at 3AM, &#34;good enough&#34;.  I'm pretty sure that's what the Director said to himself when he decided this turd of a movie was &#34;good enough&#34;.  The whole movie just felt awkward, lacked any sort of suspense, and was full of forced humor in an attempt to recycle some &#34;Die Hard&#34; quotes from the past.  Harsh?  Maybe.  I just expected more from a Die Hard.  I really hope this is the last one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I would recommend this app for anybody that likes my little pony pegasisters rule bronys too but Pegasisters are better
B00BHMETKC|2.0|I can't believe this swept the awards! I rented it because it got such excellent reviews and the preview made it out to be better than it was. Not worth the rental price.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE all the details on this game they should have been a kindergarteners game my best friend in heaven and if he was alive he would have said I love it

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book!!! I can't wait to read the Son of Neptune!! I'm also excited to see the Sea of Monsters in theaters this August!!
B00AOOHIJS|5.0|this is my favorite movie of the year, I love it. I took my 10 year old science buff son to see it in the theater and he loved it but his best friend said he didn't like it solely because it was black and white. I'm a Tim Burton buff and it is along the lines of my all time favorite movie, Nightmare before Christmas, so I was very happy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm completely addicted I love this game when I'm trying to pass time or I'm just bored . I play every chance I get
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|can't believe it didn't sweep the awards, I really enjoyed this movie and bought it after renting it. I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater, subtitles in parts really helped out
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I don't even typically like this genre but my love for the show made me pick it up, and I am so glad that I did. Much like the show, I was on my toes the whole time, but what really won me was that the dialogue so brilliantly captured the characters on which they were based that it was just like watching the show. Well done!
B000059T00|4.0|This supergroup only cut one album, and this is it.  You can find Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker (both ex-Cream members) joining force with Steve Winwood (ex-Traffic member) and producing a superb work here.  The longest track Do What You Like is especially memorable.  Though we are in the 21st Century, the album does not sound outdated at all.  Recommended.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is great full version for free love how easy it is to maneuver around and upgrade your city and buildings
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|I can't tell you how much we love this show. My baby, at 21 months, he is beginning to ask for &#34;Sheep!&#34;  Most kids shows are pretty awful and we don't allow a whole lot of TV.  This show is the big exception, and the whole family loves it.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|if you enjoy puzzles and problem solving games then I highly recomened this thrilling game.  it was free and its one of the few games that lacks anoying pop up adds. on the contrary there are only ten levels. this makes it a quick game
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I tried this movie because of all the hype surrounding the series but it proved to be too fictional for me.  I'm sure if you like that type of thing it would be good but I'm more realistic...

B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I felt it quite quite similar to Coraline in story development, that's why it was not able to engage me. I think it should have been a short story, as it was first intended. The style was worthy of Gaiman though.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I read Pollyanna first probably when I was nine years old. I immediately got pulled in by her strength and, well, gladness. I just recently found this sequel and I could not put it down.  Pollyanna, even when she grew up, wore the same joyful smile. The twists and turns in the plot kept me interested, and I didn't see most of it coming. It's a lovely story with a touching and happy ending. I would definitely recommend for anyone to read this book.

B0087EACJK|5.0|When I first got this game for my iOS devices, I couldn't put it down. Every day for multiple days on end, I was lost in this beautifully minimalist world. Trying to get the highest rating on every level kept me engaged in each for longer than your average puzzler. Turning your device to manipulate gravity is genius, and I enjoyed moving portions of the level around as \\"cards\\" to get access to new rooms. It makes you think, but no puzzle is so hard or \\"unfair\\" that you get frustrated.<br /><br />When I saw it again on Amazon (and now owning Android devices) I had to get it and play it again. Sure, it's pretty easy the second time through (after all, puzzle/adventure games typically have poor replayability), but it was no less enjoyable.<br /><br />When is Continuity 3 coming out?!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Beautiful and lyrical album from Adele, you can't go wrong with this CD, I highly recommend trying it out if you like the popular songs on this album.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Chimpact is easy to pick up and hard to put down. In the style of Donkey Kong Country, the environments are beautifully rendered and definitely portray a lush tropical land. There are also a river themed world, a swamp themed world, and a ruin themed world, each with 12 levels. After I beat the first style of gameplay, where you hunt for gems, I thought \\"Is that it?\\". OH NO IT ISN'T! You play the 4 worlds over again, but this time, each level has 5 different objectives. I enjoyed the gem game, but this objective-based style of gameplay, the \\"totem quest\\", was A BLAST.<br /><br />As you play, you can collect bananas that you can use for power ups. These are NOT in-app purchases, thank goodness! There are 8 different powerups that are all fairly useful; I got by with just getting one that allowed me to blast through barriers (bird nests) easier. You can also choose from 4 different chimps, at no banana cost whatsoever, which I liked (if it doesn't enhance gameplay, it shouldn't cost me anything, no?).<br /><br />One small complaint is that the \\"camera\\" sometimes puts the slingshot where you're going to launch the chimp really low, and it is hard to pull it all the way back without your finger going off the screen. This is remedied by just manually adjusting the camera before you shoot, but that costs time, and some of the totem missions are timed, so that can be nerve racking. Another small complaint I have is that, for a couple of levels, the objectives in the totem quest seemed almost impossible to find. They don't have to be linear like the gem quests, which is normally a positive, but there were a few times where I had absolutely no idea what to do next after playing the level 20 times over and getting stuck. You might argue that this is \\"part of the challenge\\", but I think timed missions should be about precision slingshot shooting, not getting lost trying to find something.<br /><br />Overall, really great game. Surprised me because I didn't think I'd like it so much. It will easily suck up 10 hours or more of your time - a great value at $1. Can't recommend it enough.much. It will easily suck up 10 hours or more of your time - a great value at $1. Can't recommend it enough.
0307730700|5.0|\\"Fearless\\" is the story of Adam Brown , who was a member of the elite Navy SEALS. He was a Christian, a devoted family man, and a courageous hero. But it wasn't always that way.<br /><br />  Fearless documents Adam's life from his birth and high school years in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to his growing addiction to drugs, to his time in prison (where he finally came back to God), through his training at BUD/S, and his Naval career until his tragic death in Afghanistan, where he died saving his unit from enemy fire.<br /><br />  Adam's story is so much more than just another biography. It is a story of a man who went through a literal hell, to rise above the ashes and continue on to a story that is both heroic and tragic. It is the story of a man who was deeply devoted to his wife, Kelley, and their children . It is both heartbreaking and inspiring.<br /><br />  His story left me with feelings of laughter (I spent the vast majority of my childhood in Arkansas, so I understand a lot of the country boy antics) , frustration as Adam slipped into relapse, joy as he finally overcame his battle with drug addiction , and grief for his family for their loss.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this book, as we often see the heroics of the military elite, but rarely do we see their sheer humanity, and this book definitely shows that side of Adam Brown.<br /><br />I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review.I was not required to give a positive review.

B000BZISTE|5.0|I love the collectors edition of mash I had the whole series boxed season by season and then my house burned down and I wanted to replace it and when I saw this it was great the delivery  came way before the date that was emailed to me, I would recommend this to any mash buff.
B001KWZ796|5.0|Warm fuzzy feeling when watching this movie.  Family favorite.  Nice to see a Cinderella story where the step mother finally gets what she deserves
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Engrossing show, settings and characters give a glimpse into the past and helps explain how politics, fashion, and morals evolve
B004X6PRO6|5.0|If you're looking for light-hearted summer fare, this won't fit the bill.<br /><br />If you're looking for a thought-provoking story that provides insight into life in North Korea, (not sure if anyone's actually LOOKING for that) you will thoroughly enjoy this book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Not necessarily in agreement with all behavior or values being promoted but certainly relevant to teens. Extremely funny addresses blog writing and possible consequences of opening up to the public about personal matters which teens tend to do often without thinking about the possible outcomes.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This was one of my favorite series. I was counting the days until this book came out. It tied no loose ends up for me. I really felt like the author was trying to extend this series. This book felt like a filler. I enjoyed the other two books with great passion and enthusiasm. This one did not meet my expectations. I could not wait to get done reading it.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Great movie for teens, positive message about spiritual maturity. A good youth group or Christian movie to share with students.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|The more I think about what I remember the more I really didn't enjoy it. Iron man vs lava man<br />!? They never bothered to explain why every time lava man touched him iron man basically shut down? Tony creates this new element that is supposed to lead mankind into an era of free energy for all and he throws it into the ocean?! And speaking of his super element...why the F is iron man running out of power every ten seconds his new chest piece is supposed to power a city but can't power the suit?! at one point he charges it with a car battery! Tony is getting his butt kicked by lava man at the end but and is about to meet his maker when super pepper saves him...but there are about 40+ iron man suits flying around with no one left to fight during this time?! The manchurian takes over every TV on the planet repeatedly and holds the world hostage and it turns out that he is a street performer, who I guess has no family to recognize him and no one has ever seen him before?! This could have been a very good trilogy. This latest entry seems extremely forced and very poorly thought out.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I love this movie and all of the other predator and alien movies. Came in the mail with good timing and works years later.
0812975219|1.0|I fully expected to like this book given the subject matter and all the positive buzz it received.  Now that I've read it, I find myself struggling to find the right words to express how much I hate this book.  I'm generally an upbeat, positive, glass-is-half-full kind of guy, but I honestly can't find a single redeeming quality about this book.  I slogged my way through Taleb's narcissistic tribute to his own genius in hope of finding that one pearl of wisdom that would make the torture all worthwhile, but to no avail.  There's nothing new or interesting here, just bluster. It's made worse by the complete lack of organization or unifying theme to tie together Taleb's stream of consciousness ramblings.<br /><br />When I like a book, it typically finds a permanent home on one of several already overloaded bookcases because I just can't bear to part with it.  This book found a home in the garbage can. It seemed like the only fitting repository for rubbish of this caliber.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|dont wait, buy it now.<br />if you saw the first one, this is a must see.<br />you will love it
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was interesting.  I felt the character of Jacob was flat.  I would have liked to see the author develop his character . This book had its riveting moments but completely predictable ending.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I thought the movie was great. It was entertaining every second, I could never take my eyes of the screen. There was humor and it contained most all of my favourite characters. Although it did not reflect the comics perfectly, it was still overall a great movie
B002VPE1WK|5.0|We currently own a Canon D-7000 with 2 different lenses (one for close and one for distance). This camera bag holds the camera, the extra lens, the external microphone, battery charger, extra battery, wires, SD cards and our tripod perfect. The Tripod attached to the outside side of the bag very snug and will not fall off. Everything feels safe and secure when in this bag and I would not be worried if I dropped the bag. Their is enough space while also allowing it to fit snug which the last camera bag did not do for me. Overall I am very satisfied with this AmazonBasics camera bag and would recommend it do anyone with a SLR camera!
141694737X|5.0|My son was diagnosed with mild Autism, he loves this book. Most Autistic children have a hard time engaging with others but he loves sharing this book and reading it with us, its wonderful...we read it over and over! He is non-verbal currently and cant talk but makes noises so he tries to make all the noises for the animals, very cute =)

B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Season 7 of Dexter is still just as twisted and fun as the seasons before it. Michael C Hall is still so charismatic and amkes you root for the serial killer (ie-him). Can't wait to watch the final season and see how it is all wrapped up.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cool game it's fun you should get it. I love it it's nice. If you are reading this to see if you should get it or not, you should totally get it. It's just a little laggy
B00DU74U74|5.0|This movie stays true to the book, it is fantastic. The casting is perfection. The music and setting are also amazing; worth buying let alone renting.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book helped adjust how I run so that  I could go farther without the usual aches.  It was an inspiring story as well as informative.  The author tends to veer off to other sub stories but stick with him it's all connected!  Thanks to this book, I am enjoying my run more than ever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this Is the awesomest thing ever I play this anywhere and it is way better than temple run and subway surfers
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|So I read this series in the winter of 2012. I must say I may be a little addicted to the series. Don't believe me? I've read The Hunger Games 4 times, Catching Fire at least 5 times and Mockingjay about 2 or 3 times. The reason I haven't read Mockingjay more is because I truthfully didn't like it as much. (Sorry to those who love this book beyond compare.) Catching Fire was my personal favorite in the series. But don't let this rating stop you guys from reading this book it is a worthy ending to this amazing series!!!!  (READ IT!)<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert!*<br /><br />So going more into depth with why I didn't enjoy this book as much...  First of all, to much death! I don't know about the rest of you but I adore Finnick!!! I freaked out when he died!!! Especially after he and Annie get married! Although I must say he died a worthy death. Next is Prim .... Oh beloved Prim.... WHAT THE HECK COLLINS!!!! Not only was it horribly tragic and depressing, but it was unnecessary!! Why did you kill prim? WHY!?!? Then....*sigh* then there's Peeta, who is dead to me. I realized this after his brain washing. I mean yea I was happy that he ended up all right and that Katniss chose him over Gale. (Sorry Gale fans!) But he was never the same!!! It was so sad! I like how Katniss kills Coin instead of Snow though that was VERRY good.... all in all it was still a good book, and I enjoyed it very much! (It was also better the second time) so plez read this book and enjoy!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I love this soundtrack, Hans Zimmer is the new John Williams, each track has great music in it, each track evokes a different mood, it even has an alien like feel to it. i play it just about everyday, can't say enough about it. Good job Hans Zimmer; I hope he gets an oscar for it!!!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|A not so great book by Mr. Archer. Tries to push in a lot of history and a bit of suspense, which can be seen from quite a distance.
B000FMGTTE|4.0|Their are a few Good tracks on here, but not as good as the original with John Williams!!! But not too bad!!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Very nice movie. Captures all sides of pregnancy. Funny, romantic and serious all in one. Highly recommend to all women who have or want a family one day.
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|What great acting performances, especially by Ed Harris!  It is amazing to me that this movie did not have critic and popular success.  When the academy awards come around next time, they should look at Ed Harris as best actor for his role...this is a must see!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This novel grabbed my attention from the start and never let go. I couldn't wait to find time in my day to pick up the book and read on. I think you will enjoy it as well.

0345529057|5.0|Loved it.  It held my attention from the very start and I was not able to put it down once I started.  The bundle price was almost a steal.
0689835604|5.0|This book is adorable! The illustrations are great and the flaps are super fun for our 11 month old. Like many babies Peek-a-boo is his favorite game, so this book has become his favorite at story time. He actually pointed to it last night when we asked the rhetorical question,  \\" what should we read?\\"!  Great purchase, great gift for a baby!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is the best games ever.. very cute lot of thing to do.. I just love love love this game.. recommend for anyone who likes games like the smurfs.. farmvillage and etc.

B006XBSAP2|5.0|No problems. I listen to this cd all the time and it great. I'm not sure but I think this was used but you would never know it.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|I enjoyed the read but expected a bit more substance.  The author really only provides a basic outline of tips as far as conversation goes.  You can flip through this book in about 15 minutes and grasp the concept.  Hmmmm....... Glad it was free.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I can suggest anyone to watch this movie who is a Tom Cruise fan.  It is interesting evem of you<br />re not.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|In descriptive language, the expressed view of the idea that free will does not exist was put into perspective. Satisfied
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I quite enjoyed reading this. An adventure with Holmes and Watson is never a dull one. Hence, you should definitely read this!!
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I was surprised that this worked with my Dell wireless printer V525w.  I haven't needed to upgrade to the pro version yet.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|The first two books were fantastic and this one had its moments, however i found it to be lacking in storyline it seemed repetitive at times and didn't seem to be going anywhere fast and the ending was terrible, however i am hoping that the 4th book is better. I think it would have been better if it was a 3 book series as this book didn't seem necessary  however I haven't given up hope.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Lana Del Rey's Born To Die - Paradise Edition is the bomb. She's got such an acoustic voice with eclectic songs!

B00AMBH70S|2.0|Sometimes the movie studios carry a product to far. The Bourne series with Jason Bourne the first two were exciting action since then the series has not lived up to those first two films.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a quirky, fun, action adventure with an all star cast. Lots of action sequences as well as comedy. Some foul language but not a lot(one f bomb). I don't want to drop any spoilers so I'll just say that I saw this movie when it was in theaters and I liked it so much that I rented it to watch when my daughter was down visiting.
B006G7R25W|4.0|This movie was well directed well acted with a great Cold War plot. Movies like this and others in this genre like Bedford Incident were well written and well done.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Very inspiring and thought provoking! I enjoyed the book and recommend it to anyone who has questioned their worthiness or Faith.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I really enjoy watching the UK version episodes through Amazon Prime. Easier than the dvr durung the regular season on PBS here in the US.

B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles this one is the best. The graphics are beautiful. The pieces fit together nicely and has a little click sound so you know the pieces went together. I like how the pieces are on the right side of the screen and you scroll down through for the one you want. I also like how you can push on the 2nd button on the bottom right side and it will give you the border pieces, push same button again it will let you scroll through all the pieces. There also a nice melody playing. They offer you a lot of free puzzles. If you like jigsaw puzzle don't pass this one up. I highly recommend this app.
B000HEVALC|5.0|I really like to listen to this cd. I really don't like so much is all talk and not to much singing. I remember when they all started their singing careers. I am a music guy, I really like the 50&#34;sound. I will be buying more of these cds.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|He has a very easy voice to listen to when you sit down in the evening.<br />It adds nice variety.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Difficult to keep up with all the characters but a lovely story. Really portrayed well the sad and difficult lives of people in this troubled country
B000I0QK74|4.0|This is a good dvd for diversity to your holiday music. Very easy to listen to and enjoyed by<br />a wide age group.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|It's like watching a MTV with story plots behind them.  Excellent execution and interesting characters and plots. I got to watch it with my daughter too. Good for the family entertainment.
B003629IPW|5.0|My 6 yr old granddaughter loved it. She is a real fan to the point of doing his moonwalk. This is one of his<br />really good DVD'
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a great app, but recently they added ads, youtube-type videos and extras to it. Now I can't even find the hourly weather. There are now ways to \\"earn rewards\\" on it as well. I don't want rewards, I just want to know if it's going to rain in the next few hours so I can plan my day. Hope they go back to the old app, pre-advertisements, but in the meantime, I deleted it from my kindle and am using my local television station app where I can just get weather.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|i uninstalled it yesterday.  forecasts have become less accurate during the past few months and, since when does a weather service app need to become a game with &quot;achievements&quot;?  it's too busy, too cartoony, and the forecasts are still inaccurate.  and thanks for the distracting ads everywhere.  it's alot like the weather channel itself.  it has everything on it but the weather.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Love the SG1 series.  I watch this series twice a year.  Acting is good and has a great story line and realistic back stories.
B0000012XC|5.0|This set of the sonatas dates from the early 1950's and is in mono. This compares with the later stereo remake made in the 1960's. That later set has marginally less spontaneous playing in several of the sonatas and the sound is not really an improvement over the mono set which is remarkably good and certainly capable of delivering musical satisfaction without undue compromise. Indeed, it is arguable that the piano sound is preferable.<br /><br />The performances themselves are very similar. Having owned both sets for many years, I have steadily developed a preference for this earlier set, fine though the later set undoubtedly is. Kempff plays in such a way as to make one unaware of an 'interpreter' in any interventionist sense of the word. Rather, he seems to simply play the music as it is - in other words, as Beethoven wrote it. This is not as easy as it seems, otherwise there would be countless others to choose from at this level. Nor is it possible to be absolutely sure of what Beethoven intended, especially bearing in mind the developments in piano manufacture since then. However, the illusion remains and seems valid at the time of listening.<br /><br />To expand a little, it is possible to make some generalisations about Kempff's approach to these works. Firstly he works on a relatively limited range of dynamics and tempo, avoiding the extremes of expression and keeping within the tonal limitations of his piano and the bounds of the generally perceived realms of the Classical period. At no time will the speed of a Richter, the power of an Ashkenazy or the percussive aggression of a Kovacevich be heard. The sense of restrained proportion of a Gilels is closer to Kempff but without the power.<br /><br />If this sounds so safe as to be without interest then that is to be unaware of the compensating attractions. Although Kempff works within the limitations as described above and keeps within perceived period boundaries, his skill lies in the extraordinary variety of subtlety he brings to touch and phrasing, almost as if it is an alive thing to be constantly cared for and managed throughout each performance. Thus, as each piece unfolds, it is like an act of spontaneous creation, the act of actually conceiving of the work itself. One must remember that Beethoven himself was renowned during his lifetime for his highly developed ability to improvise for extended periods of time with complete musical conviction. This is how Kempff comes over as a pianist and each sonata has its own subtleties and there is progression through the sonatas as boundaries are stretched and move away from the early classical model.<br /><br />it is not appropriate to enter into a detailed analysis of each work within such a large body of work such as this. However, the above outline of Kempff's apparent approach to this music and some suggestions as to comparisons may be helpful to those considering this purchase.<br /><br />I would therefore conclude by suggesting that this set has earned its place as one of the long-term reference sets for collectors and as such is certainly well worth some serious consideration as a purchase option.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Excellent, intelligent and very helpful review.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Years later, I can now say that this is the best Britney Spears album of all time. It's buried in history, mostly forgotten, and hardly successful compared to her other releases, but it's everyone else's loss if they don't listen to it.  It's actually considered to be a mix of RnB/Swing, Europop, and Euro House.  A stellar, consistent album of edgy club tracks.<br /><br />I still have a copy of underground demos that leaked out before the official version, and I still like the raw versions better, but have grown used to the official as well. Amazing album all the way through. Don't miss out on the bonus tracks like \\"Everybody\\" and \\"Get Back\\" that appear on special versions of the album, so if you never got those, check them out. I even like the sappy, mellow bonus cut called \\"Outta This World.\\" It's Britney, b*tch.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|This is a murder pot boiler at a Miss. Marple-esque pace and a Goodreads people's choice nominee for funniest crime thriller of the year.  I hope it wins.<br /><br />English author Duncan Whitehead does crime in an off-handed, character driven way that is charming and filled with gentility.  Laps around a dog walker 's park lead to Argentina and Paris and red herrings galore.  Some of the characters deserve Spanish Moss growing in their hair.<br /><br />So join the Club. Huzzah for Whitehead. More please. 5 stars.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Though one could sense impending doom throughout the entire season, you can't help but want more of this British drama!  It's amazing how opinions change about characters in a blink of an eye. And who can't resist the tongue in cheek humor of the Dowager Countess?  Cannot wait until Season 4.......
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Every movie i watch with Wahlberg is great.  I love his alpha personality. The only thing I hated about this movie was that his dog gets killed.  :(  'The Departed' character is still my favorite, however.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not his best, perhaps but very readable. The main character changed personalities halfway through, which was disconcerting. Good beach book!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The premise of this film seemed interesting so I watched it. The mark of a good story is one that would work on a stage with minimal props and dazzling effects. Characters that you identify with are also a plus. Look elsewhere if you're hoping for a coherent narrative and sympathetic characters.<br />  The premise involves past lives, karma, and the effect one's actions have on the future. Evidently they signed off on a huge budget for big name actors,cgi, wardrobe, and set design without considering that a good screenplay might be a good idea.<br />The result is a confusing mishmash of about 6 vignettes that take place throughout history and into the future. The scenes flip back and forth arbitrarily and leave you wondering  why you spent three hours of your life watching this.<br />  I imagine the book the film was based on might be worth a look. If you like the premise, consider watching the film adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's &#34;Slaughterhouse 5&#34;, which also deals with time travel while managing to be touching, funny, beautiful and thought provoking. The book is great,also.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game!  Yes, it's a quick play, but that's probably because I couldn't put it down.  The graphics are great, the puzzles were challenging, the storyline is interesting, and some of the music is just plain creepy.  After I finished it, I played it again!!!
0978607651|5.0|A well printed book of masterful designer/artist Charlie Harper.This is a joy. I look at my copy regularly and always find some small wonders I missed the last time. He was an extremely prolific artist whose influence on modern design is enduring. An excellent gift for anyone interested in art.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really interesting story line.  I like the graphics and it was really cool to interact within hidden object games. Would definitely recommend.  Wish was easier to buy entire game upfront instead of interrupting play.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|When the real story was revealed at the end, I felt cheated. It was such a let down. The one thing that I took away from the movie was when the \\"Adult Pi\\" talks about life becoming an act of letting go & appreciating what his parents taught him but, not having the opportunity to say thank you before it was too late, was the only thing that moved me. Such a waste.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|easy to use,, helps with spelling, quick response, works as well on my smart phone.  GVreat help for Jumble and crosswords.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game on the kindle fire is a really good addition.<br />u should get it is really fun.<br />for me it was to free!!)<br />so yeah!!)<br />U should get this game right after yo read thisss!!)<br /><br />  <3 Christina!!)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works with my Galaxy S4 to download and/or view YouTube videos that can't be seen on mobile devices for whatever reason.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am very impressed with this game! It is more addicting than temple run, has more people and power ups, and is challenging to play. It is a worthwhile choice, especially since it's free!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome if you like this game you also might subway surfers.this game is good for all ages and is really fun
B009NY43NY|5.0|A twist I was trendy for still great and was hooked from the start. Wish this wasn't the end to the series
0345529057|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should buy all books at once without knowing first whether I would be interested in the sequel to the first one.  But needless to say, I am officially HOOKED and can't wait to devour rest of books.  This was a great deal, I'm glad I purchased.
B002HTWYZ6|5.0|A very well recorded CD. Music is clean, tight and natural with great space around the instruments / musicians. Highly recommended if your preference lies with the Jazz genre. A great recording to test your system's capability.
B00AVFO41K|2.0|i looked at other reviews before trying the game and they said impossible to win. those reviews are correct i have tried tje game and it is impossible.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book was one I could not put down. It kept me excited to see where the author would take me page after page.
B007L5LD9O|5.0|Persuasion was slower than this movie and Pride and Prejudice was about the same pace. It had just the right amount of romance and good looking men.
0061478784|4.0|If you can stand a departure from maturity, this book is worth the read. The plot feels a little bit jumbled and confusing - not quite so clear as the movie - but her writing style is crisp and fresh, never growing stale even after repeated reads. The book is also a delightful break from the seriousness of other fantasy novels. It's absolutely hilarious at points and will undoubtedly make you laugh out loud...so you probably shouldn't read it in a library.
159514188X|5.0|I picked this book up at the recommendation of a few friends, but none of them knew the impact this book would have on me. A definite must-read.
B005LAII3A|2.0|Up front, I am not a fan of Colin Farrell, so I waited until the price came way down on this one.<br />As expected, it turned out as I had predicted.<br />The movie was very muddy with just enough story line to almost make it worth watching.<br />Hire three big names, throw in non stop action and CGI, and this is what you get.<br />The only thing worth watching was the very physical Kate Beckinsale go through her fight scenes.<br />Poor Jessica Biel should have probably stayed home, as her talents were never even partially utilized.<br />I did not compare this Total Recall to the original, but took it on it's own merits, and while it had<br />it's moments, was an overall flop.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This is one of those books that forever changed the trajectory of my life.  You can read the other reviews on what it's about, but when you absorb the research and understand the ramifications it can change your life and the life of your family.  I operate differently in every facet of life now, I parent differently and my marriage is better.  Most books are good education and they have things that are good to know, but you can be a different person, you will be motivated to be a different person, after you read this book.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I know this app skews politically to the left, and I'm ok with that. What I dislike is the crude attempt at humor and strangely out of place sex stories on the main news page. How can I take you seriously HuffPo? I fit your young educated liberal demographic, but I don't want to scroll past \\"men twerking to classical music\\" before I get to the article on the latest news in Washington.<br /><br />Update: videos and pictures fail to load on frequent basis. Scratch another star.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|the product is very good, has many important functions, is a very functional for any activity and / or work.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I feel like the creative and imaginative ideas were just bursting from this book! There were so many wonderful thoughts written in here that I feel like the actual writing took a backseat. Like Riggs had all these great ideas but to keep the book from being 1,000,000 pages long they had to scale them back at the sake of some detail.<br /><br />This book would be fantastic for teenagers and preteens. It is kept very chaste and the writing easy to understand. I enjoyed it as an adult but I think I would have been head over heels if I had read it as a teen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|once I started figuring out the clues, I couldn't stop until I had gone up the 10 levels. can't wait until more are available.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|As a long time AIC fan I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of a new AIC album.Their last one Black Becomes Blue was great and the revised lineup didn't disappoint. So I am proud to say that The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is a continuation of the AIC legacy. Opening with the heavy rocker Hollow you instantly know it's AIC and that they are going to deliver the goods. The standout track for me is Stone which is in the upper echelon of AIC songs in my view. Other songs like Low Ceiling and the title track also are of note.With 12 songs you will get a bit of filler and  1 track rewrites a riff from a previous AIC song as well. I highly recommend this album as a nice addition to your heavy rock collection.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great Action!!! Funny!!! Sad!! translates well for comic to screen very worth buying watching an keeping. Robert Downey Jr, It surly great to see him doing what he loves.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game versions 1 and 2. Although 2 is better of course with the heightened animation. Just down loaded 2 fun fun and more fun!
0875428940|5.0|I highly recommend this deck. It is also a good deck for Beginners learning to work with Tarot cards because the symbology is very clear. The artwork is delightful. Katrinna Wynne teaches Tarot Classes on line from the Oregon Coast and this worked well with her class.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|My three year old son recieved this as a birthday gift.  He love, love, loves this pool.  He will play in/on it for hours.  However I do have a few complaints.  1st, you have to blow this up w/air manually(I was under the impression that you filled the tubes w/water using a hose). We don't have a pump and the bike pump we do have didn't work with the size of the holes for the pool.  It took FOREVER to blow all of this up and there were two of us doing the work.  Once it is filled w/air and you're left hyperventilating, the main tubes around the pool do continue to hold air very well.  The small items such as the slide, and tree do need to have air added daily in order for them to work and/or stand up properly.  Especially the slide.  If the slide is not completely full, it won't bear weight very well. It doesn't take too long to add some air, however you have to GET IN THE POOL and on your hands and knees in order to get to the holes, so you are most definately going to get wet....2nd complaint would be that it is near impossible to move once you do have water in it.  It weighs a ton.  Once you spend all that time and energy blowing it up, you don't want to take it down to move it.  We don't take it down, but it takes emptying a lot of water out of it and two adults to DRAG it over to a different area so the grass won't die.  Overall, my son loves it and it's holding up well, hence the 4 stars.  However if I had to grade it just on convience and ease, it would be a 1!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how fun this game is it feels like you own a real horse in conclusion I love my horse!
B008J34466|5.0|Love Pink....love this album.  If you purchase it, you probably won't regret it.  I have no regrets... Happy listening, everyone!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This is the genus of the &#34;King and Maxwell&#34; series. Tells how the two former Secret Service agents were drawn together to solve a common case, and went on to form their own private investigator company. A gripping story with many twists and turns.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not a huge television buff....but I kept seeing friends posting on FaceBook about this and hearing people talk about it, that I decided to give it a shot.  I would be embarrassed for you to know how many hours that I watched this, once I began.  I have seen all 3 seasons and just wonder how I'll make it till more are ready to watch.  Awesome.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|It's a good story but complicated<br />You should read it anyways but if you hate fighting than this is not the book for you
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Unexpectedly good and suspenseful. Don't normally watch these kind of movies based on YA novels but this was really good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series. No obscenities, no nudity, excellent acting.  I was disappointed with the ending of the third season but I'm sure there is a reason.
6304698798|5.0|I think it's an unedited version which makes it unique and awesome, it seems to have scenes that I've never seen before and that's really cool compared to most other copies of the Good the Bad and the Ugly. Fast shipping and great Cost. Thanks so much!
1442366621|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of the book and began the fast diet on April 11th.  I am a middle-aged woman and had tried numerous things to lose weight.  I needed to lose about 14 pounds to get back to where I wanted to be.  Today, 3 months later, I have lost 14 pounds.  I feel great, friends and family tell me I look great and it was not difficult at all.  I just had to get my arms around the fact that I was consuming too many calories to maintain my acceptable weight.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Not the kind of book I would normally like but this trilogy was very exciting and  &#34;can't put it down&#34; except for this second one.  Compared to the first and third book, this was dragged a little.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We enjoyed the movie, not a big Tom Cruise fan, but all in all a pretty good movie.<br /><br />two more words, I hate this part of reviewing.
B000W93CHC|3.0|I've read several of Ken Follett's books and found them very, very good.  However, this one has been dumbed down.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Couldn't give it 5 stars because I got 2 weeks into the app and unlocked some minions then it decided to not open. Had to uninstall then reinstall. It works now but it is still a headache.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun. Not too easy, not too hard. Very addicting! Keep the levels coming, I can't wait to play more!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Not the most focused or strong but better than dark!<br />Quick light in a pinch!  You won't stumble.  Easy to operate.
B00633W614|5.0|Having read the first installment of The Clifton Chronicles, I eagerly awaited this one. Obviously, I was not disappointed. The story<br />begins with Harry Clifton's dilemma in entering the United States and continues rapidly through ensuing episodes. This book, too,<br />ends with a vital question unanswered. It served its purpose as I have already read the third installment and enjoyed it as much as the first two.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A can't put it down until you know how it ends book. Well defined and fully dimensional characters keep you fully engaged in the plot
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset provides superior sound quality to all other headsets I've owned in my life, is comfortable to wear, and just plain looks cool. This is a must-buy for a quality gaming experience.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|This storyline is unlike most others.  It focused around an alien and her conflict between two worlds, her own and the one her species has invaded.  Throughout the movie, the flaws of humanity are shown, but as it continues, the uniqueness of humanity is revealed as well.  I don't want to put in any spoilers in this review, so I won't.  However, this movie has a great message and meaning that can be appreciated whether you are or are not a fan of The Twilight Saga and Stephenie Meyer.  Twilight and The Host are completely different, and this movie and novel should not be overlooked just because they are from the same author.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not stop reading it!  I loved how it went back and forth, written from husband and wife's perspective!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This movie was pretty good & more in the usual Cruise genre.  I liked the actors & laughed at a few parts although story wasn't a comedy.  Wouldn't own this one but a decent rental.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great story about how teens deal with cancer, just a heartwarming story about bad things happening to young people and how they cope.
B002QZ399G|3.0|This movie was interesting for the foreign components, risk etc. If this is your genre, then it's fine. Not at the top of my list ...
B001DE29SS|5.0|Chaplin was a true creator of comedy. After watching this movie I see him as more then a comedian, I see him as a true hero. I never knew what type of man he really was until watching this movie. Excellent movie and very touching in so many ways. Its a movie that shows you his true side. I can not tell you anymore until you watch it. I highly recommend it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I have started ruling out movies & selecting movies based on the actors' body of work.  They seem fairly consistent in putting out movies to their fans overall.  Denzel is a good actor whether playing a good guy or not.  As I said, I just like him. :)
B004TI5N38|4.0|Well developed plot with consistent detail development. Lots of action and macho military maneuvers, if that is your thing. A bit too much social class warfare for my taste-commentary about the evil, greedy, callous wealthy people!  But, well written and engaging.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|It was a bit confusing and boring.  I thought the scene between the 2 females was annoying & a unbelievable conclusion.  The ending tied up the loose ends.  Mostly a waste of time hoping it would have a better story.
0061733199|5.0|Very thorough.  It will go into my BugOutBag for reference.  Too much to remember just reading through it.  I would recommend it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I enjoyed how the author tied together an understanding of knowledge/intelligence with the life and works of Tesla. The title is a bit misleading because while its focus is on Tesla, it also relates to a theory of how to generate more &#34;intelligence.&#34; Regardless, it was a wonderful and well-written book.
B00C5GZKVQ|4.0|Not sure I have the strafing right but nice keeps some of the kids around busy. Not violent either which is nice. Shooting at model helicopters not real ones.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun and some levels too easy.  hope to have more levels out soon.  hopefully levels after 10 will get more challenging.  Multi room levels were pretty good.  most levels were elementary
B00821PCJS|5.0|My girlfriend showed me one episode and I was pretty hooked. It's a bit hard to get used to the beginnings (which start in what feels like the middle of a story) but you get used to it. The story arcs are not over extended or used to make extra unnecessary episodes. Overall it's a great show. I hope it lasts for some time.
B000003RCY|5.0|The album was in great condition when I bought it used and it was generally what you would expect when you buy a cd. You know... Music?
B009MO5ES8|5.0|Willee (Gordon Levitt) is a smart ass, who rides like lightning in this fun to watch, thriller. Michael Shannon reprise the role he plays on Boardwalk Empire as the prick who does what the hell he wants. The movie flirts with drugs, gamblling and the world of China's infamous Black Market. It is told by a nonlinear story method, where what you think you know you are wrong. Then you got it and your wrong again.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I love this author, and while I wouldn't put this book as one of his best I still found myself staying up late and turning those pages.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin does not disappoint. A superb new album by this great song writer and singer..<br /><br />A good CD to listen to in the car on the way to work.!!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I read it as a kid and I am happy to do it again. Sometimes you have to just give yourself a break from all the adult stuff that crowds the media and news. I could get lost in the book and appreciate a time when life was a little less complicated and not so high tech. It's a good read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game love  the different levels the voices are too cute five stars keep more coming !!!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I had trouble getting to the beginning of this book.  I bought the audio version and found that that did not help.  The three readers spoke with a heavy accent so the book was hard to listen to.  The book had too many difficult names with too many convoluted twists to the story.  Finally after a discussion with my book club I was able to tup the entire story with the connections in the book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This was a great game until it started crashing every time my son tried to open it. Please fix this!
B002TVQ4GW|4.0|I highly recommend this movie. The plot continues to twist and turn till the very end. Solid acting! Good old fashion horror flick with another room 237, from the Overlook Hotel. I'll watch this again.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|funny and true to life about borderline polar personalities. Deniro cooper and the full cast was enjoyable. Truly a treat.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|I bought this for the 3D and Nick. Very pleased I did. Good 3D although there are some glare,problems with windows thru out the movie. Hard to really notice because there's so much action. The sound is excellent. The plot is typical action movie fare, thin. Nick is good, Patrick Lussier is great and Amber Heard is excellent plus super hot. Buy it.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|the beauty and the landscape was something to behold. Is witness the sample of the up coming input and if it is anything like this movie, it should be a treat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played through the various levels during my breaks at work. The first several levels are extremely easy, but they start to get more challenging around level 5 or 6. Not too hard that you can't figure it out on your own,but it does require some thinking at times. I would love to see more levels or more games like this one.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|tarantino does it again, He is one of the directors. the movie was quite enjoyable for one and all. thanks
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Saw the price and had to try it. Overall, the bag is a good bag but it does (as you would imagine) have a few drawbacks .. one pretty big, the rest minor.<br /><br />Pros :<br /><br />I can easily fit my Canon 6D, 50mm 1.8, 17-40L f4, 70-200L f4, YN-560 II flash, two wireless remote triggers and several packs of batteries (just in the main compartment).<br /><br />The build quality is nice, I have had no issues with tears, etc.<br /><br />Cons :<br /><br />When fully loaded, this bag seems to want to choke me, it just doesn't sit well at all. This is a pretty big issue, hence losing two stars.<br /><br />The straps for holding the tripod in place are easily lost if not clipped together when no tripod is being carried. I would think a way to secure these strips without having them clipped (Hey, I'm forgetful) would be better.<br /><br />If you need a cheap bag, this one will do .. but just keep in mind the cons.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|a truly great adventure of to and fro. the cinema and the places of respect were of sense of aw for back and forth was a rollercoaster ride of fun.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|This book was chock full of boring historical nonsense, secondary characters you don't much care for, and useless inner monologues... None of which contributed to main story lines readers actually care about.  All that said, I truly hope all this killing of my favorite characters leads to a masterful ending.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the 1st time that I've ever written a review for any book. I got hooked with this book right after I try the sample. It is so good with great plot and characters. It's unique because it was written in a guy POV. The author did a  really good job in that. I love Drew and Kate. Drew is so funny, honest and caring in his own way. The way he thinks and talks is so funny. Kate is a girl with backbone not some whiny, stupid chicks who fall head over heel for the male alpha leads. Buy this book and you will never regret it. I'm looking forward to buy more book from thus author in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun creative different. Countries that make cense but need to make more places or states<br />And people or more cheap hoverboards<br />Q
0061950726|5.0|I absolutely loved this story and found it very hard to put down.  It was amazing to find how so many orphans from New York were just shipped off on trains to live in totally alien environments; all done in the name of 'Christian Charity'.  The lives of the two main protagonists were similar in so many ways while they appeared on the surface at least to be total opposites.  It just goes to show, you can't judge a book by it's cover.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's easy to use . The  only thing is remember to turn up your volume.<br />!!! ;) This I d the best free alarm app. I promote you you will be satisfied with this app.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The ending is stupid. After all that and then that ending? Really? An author with that kind of imagination should be able to do better than that.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Great film. Cruise was delicious. Another reviewer mentioned that Tom played the role exactly right . I totally agree. He was subdued, sort of Anthony Hopkins like. I thought he was brilliant.
B007JMW46U|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is among the bast stories I have ever read and seen made into reality. Sherlock Holmes is the perfect man as created by Sor Arthur Conan Doyle.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The documentary format of this book was different than most fiction books.  The detail in story telling was great. I would recommend this to anybody that has an interest in intelligent story telling.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is amazing and fun I would recommend it it is for fans of my little pony and describes the fun adventures of the gang
B0091REZMW|4.0|Great for killing time. good theme, good music...keeps you guessing on what you'll come across next.<br />I'm still kind of new but love it so far...a little harder to see on kindle fire.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's a mix of despicable me and my favorite running games subway surfers and temple run with extra it is awesome
B000066744|5.0|I saw this movie by chance on one of the movie channels. And thought how did this one get by me. I will never know. I watched it again and finally made sure i got it on DVD so i could watch it when i wanted. A + acting all the way through it. And a good story makes it one of those films you cant get out your mind. A+++++++ and maybe better than that. I dont think it won any awards. But isnt that the way it seems  the way to go in Hollywood. ? I missed it because i never saw it advertized. (Shame)... Watch it you will like it. I bet you will have to watch it again and again. It is that good..
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The vital attitude of the film's young Indian hotel owner was inspiring.  It is a movie that left me with a blissed out feeling
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise,mainly due to his ability to perform most of his own stunts.Besides that,the movie lived up to my expectations,action and a great plot.
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|I always look forward to Neil Gaiman's latest releases, with the expectation of being entertained and challenged by his often &#34;sideways&#34; view of the world around him. &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; was no exception. Some people may find it disturbing to be immersed in Neil Gaiman's ideas, which extend in ways and directions that challenge the comfortable certainties of our everyday lives, and hint at powerful supernatural forces which lurk below the otherwise normal-appearing surface. The notable difference in this story is the lack of the unequivocally &#34;happy ending&#34; previously so typical of all his other works that I have read to date.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I'm hooked! These characters feel like people I know and I find myself cheering or booing them.  Right now I'm hanging on the edge until I know who died in that crash.....................
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are well-written, riveting and will keep your attention from start to finish.  The characters are complex, and overall the series has an edgy, dark sci-fi feel (think of things like Soylent Green and/or the Running Man).  There is violence but it makes sense and is not gratuitous.  Worth a read, regardless of age.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun to do. not to hard but makes you think. cant wait for more levels. need more words. neef more words<br />need more words.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what it says. It lets me know how much time remains for standby, music, reading and videos.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|This is one of my favorite cold war movies of all time.  Great bluray transfer, great exposure.  Do not hesitate to buy it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Most likely the best WWII story I've read - and I've read a lot of stories about WWII! A must read!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray version after owning the DVD version.  The audio in this bluray version is great- as great as the DVD version.  The entire concert is contained on one Bluray disc as opposed to two DVD's.  I consider this their best work- not many 80's groups sound so close to the original songs.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|What more can be said that other reviewers haven't already?  This is an outstanding mobile game which plays flawlessly on my Galaxy S4.  It is a shame that Google Play doesn't allow phone users to install this game, but I suppose that is to Amazon's benefit.  Thanks to the developers for producing such a slick and enjoyable game, and thanks to Amazon for allowing me to install it on my phone.  Now back to playing the game!
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I love the Underworld series, and this is a logical continuation of that story line.  Great video transfer and some of the best audio around- it will really showcase your surround sound system as well as your subwoofer.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This guy is 5&#34; of solid 1/4 steel. You see that tree over there? Is that tree bothering you? Well, now you can show it how much of a man you are and chop it into kindling as fast as you desire. You can deck it out with different grips, strip the coating if you desire, etc. I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i had technical problems in the begining but other tha that it a great game it is also a very challenging game for your finger
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play.  Opens quickly. I haven't encountered any glitches.  There are ads, but they don't interfere with actual play, and they keep it free.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's a great war game. Love that there's no energy involved. Great strategy and units.<br />Well made. I look forward to future updates.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun and challeneging some rooms more than others. I cant wait until the next levels are available
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I expected the book to be insightful about social changes in models of work. Instead I received inconsistent pile of personal stories, tacked around several points that barely touch the issue. It's like someone has taken all these years' papers out of drawer and assembled an incoungruent &#34;thing&#34; out of it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I wish I can be rich and have friends to play. Great game. This is way to fery cool. Awesome.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, it kept me thinking and on my toes to find the objects n solve the puzzles. I'm looking forward for more room n I will tell my friends about can you escape for them to play.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was having a good time with the app over the last few weeks, until today.  I was locked out and forced to try to update, except when I tried, no update was available.  I forced appstore to repair and lost all my progress.  Then when it did finally update, I got a parse error message.  Good job on the update, I had to uninstall.
B00BGIC170|4.0|Melissa McCarthy, as usual, was a perfect in this movie.  Be sure to watch the extra content at the end of the movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so easy to use and it is so addicting!! It's only been four months and I have over ten thousand pinned already and over 500 followers. It's great! I definitely recommend it for anyone who needs a new hobby or time-killer :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|the fact that 2 people with that many problems can actually overcome them and learn not to run from each other. I read all three and am waiting for the next chapter of their lives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I got into this show a few years ago, this season kept up with everything I expected.  I hope there is another season!
B00846REIS|2.0|Annoying characters and one too many sex scenes.  I like an easy read, but I lost brain cells by reading this book.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Well done documentary - really enjoyed learning about her life and the mix of convert footage plus interviews made this a fun movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome!<br />Really enjoyed being able to use my brain and have fun. I would for sure recommend this download! Great way to take a break and keep your mind fresh.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, but so fun that I beat all the levels in a few hours. Wish there were more levels to play.very challenging, and gets harder as you go
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters without knowing much about it. I knew it was filmed beautifully, but not until I watched in 3D did I realize just how amazing the filming was. Some people felt this story was too preachy or religious. I didn't get that vibe at all...it does speak of religion, but not one but many. It is about a man's personal story of survival. I love the twist in the story from a psychology aspect...though I did think I had it figured out part way through. I did, but still a good story. Highly recommend.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was searching for another book similar to this one  before I was finished reading it. Very sensitive and compelling.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I had no doubts I would love this movie. I loved the LOTR and the first part of the Hobbit. I am counting down the days until the next part of the movie. Can't wait to see Smaug played by Benedict Cumberbatch! Filmed beautifully, great story, amazing soundtrack and terrific character portrayals by very talented actors.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Not as good as previous books.  It was supposed to be a book for adults but I found it perhaps a young adult level.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a wonderful movie. Daniel Day Lewis was phenomenal! No wonder he got such accolades. Sally Fields puts her heart and soul into her character.
B007704HO6|5.0|I never had time or patience for drug addicts, but this book was so meaningful, delightful, easy ready and inspiring, I look at many things in a different light. well done James Bowen and Bob<br />Glynis Keet South Africa
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I know, I know it won awards, but I didn't see it before that happened. This is a movie of imperfect people, problems, struggles, raw emotion and it was wonderful. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence was refreshing. If you want to cry, laugh and everything in between watch this movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My daughter and I got this for my husband for fathers day. It was something they both enjoy watching together.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Allows you to do more than just click and wait. You get to be invopved in battles. And it is free.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|it's a quick reference that I like to use to know where they got their information...quick reference for when my 8 year old asks me random weird questions, like, &#34;Where does polio come from?&#34;  I want to know where that question came from!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I LOVE Despicable Me especially the minions! I got the app and it is just like subway suffers. I played it once and then the next day it wouldn't let me... I had to delete it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this game is silly, and sometimes I just slide a pudding monster off the table to hear its little cry, which is cute.  I think this is a good puzzler game and very innocent.  Don't like that you can buy solutions so easily, so if your little one is using your phone or tablet, make sure he/she does not get anything you don't want to pay for!
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Good family movie....excellent teacher role model....neglected child smart beyond her age....bad parents and brother...exciting and funny;  all mixed with a little magic.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|meaningless silly game, but it's a puzzle sort of, and it captures my attention and my kids' attention.  They like it as well.  Easy time sink.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Inspiring!  Great story of a boy who uses what he has to create energy and solve problems, highly recommended read
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|just a calculator for me; I don't use its advanced products, but I would be sure they're fine to use for the graphic calculator stuff.  Old me :)
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The movie had its funny moments, but overall, it was more serious than expected. It left us feeling kind of depressed to be honest. Sorry.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|of course, the only job where you can be wrong and still earn your salary is a weather person, and we have a running joke in my house about the weather...this app is as good as any other, I suppose
B001P3SA8U|5.0|I got this for my sweetie's birthday. It's his all time favorite movie and he LOVES it! Thank you so much!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|the Kindle tried to direct you to Bing, which all the commercials for it make it seem lovely, but I am a tried-and-true googler, so I keep google instead
B000Q66JXA|5.0|This movie is visually wonderful! It is a marvelous telling of the King Author legend, I really loved the Merlin character, and the Holy Grail quest was simply stunning. This is a wonderful movie, the costumes were fabulous and this is a thoroughly entertaining movie that I would highly recommend.
B000V39KDO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I wish they had a 3d version. That would really put the cherry on the cake
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Everything about this movie was AWESOME!! This is now one of my top 5 favorite movies, and any red blooded American woman would be crazy about this movie. Lots of GREAT LOOKING guys, lots of action, lots of funny &#34;quips&#34;. This movie was worth every cent, and I DEFINITELY recommend this movie to anyone who loves action, adventure and sexy hot guys!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandsons love this game even though they are only 1 and 2 years old. It's easy for them to view because it's on my Kindle. D Me2 Rocks!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|like my descipsion says I love minions!! its basicly just like temple run or subway suffers! Yay!!! get this app!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have never played MtG before until I downloaded this game. Now I am addicted and want to start collecting cards to build a deck of my own irl.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|This movie was bizarre the whole inner voice thing was annoyingly dramatic. Walked out of the movie and looked st friends and said what did you think consenses was it was ok not a great movie. Had the whole Stephanie Meyer love triangle thing and some sports cars thrown in for promotion.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is sooo fun! the game is definitely an improvement over Bloons TD 4. the new towers are awesome. WARNING this game is really addictive. get it!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|They added this mPoints feature in order to he able to throw more advertising in your face. In the meantime, they also took away useful features like he hourly forecast and the In Season reports (pollen reports and such) both of which I use frequently. I don't mind putting up with ads in a free app, but not at the expense of actual useful features. Am uninstalling and will be looking for another app that isn't so intent on sacrificing information for advertising.
B001R10BM8|5.0|Exactly what I wanted thanks for the quick shipping and great product not the best of the series but needed for entire set
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book from the very first paragraph.  It's been a long time since I've read something where the author was able to get inside each characters' heads through written prose, rather than only dialogue.<br /><br />For a book that only has a few locations in it, I felt like I was given a tour of them all - that's how good this book was written.<br /><br />I look forward to Mr. Howey's future books, as well as his others that are currently in circulation.<br /><br />I will always watch anything directed by Kubrick, Fincher, P.T. Anderson and Wes Anderson, and now I will read anything by Chuck Palahniuk, Neal Stephenson, Jonathan Lethem and Hugh Howey.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|This is a great movie encompassing several stories.  As with most rom coms, there is some unrealistic situations, but unlike most rom coms, there are some reality checks which I enjoyed.  Overall, I highly recommend.
B008602KQI|1.0|I really don't know how this movie won any awards. In my opinion it was the most borning movie I've ever seen in my life. To those who enjoy it. More power to you, but it just didn't catch my attention.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|He has done it again. What a wonderful piece of music. These songs will lift you up and make one feel good.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|What's not to say good about this movie? It's THOR.. This is a great movie to watch if you love the Marvel Avengers movie. This gives you the chance to see how Thor became the protector of Humans and gained some humanity himself. I loved it!!
B00CW665VI|4.0|I highly recommend this book. It has interesting characters and throughout the book, I couldn't stop smiling and laughing. However, it was very cheesy but it fits nicely which turn into comical relief. Also, I love how it is the male POV; it's rather interesting and hilarious!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was great!  I couldn't put it down.  Was a little surprised by the ending, but I absolutely loved it!!  Sylvia Day is such a great author!!
B00969PR18|2.0|I found it to be inaccurate on addresses and locations lications. Sometimes it would work and sometimes not. I would not rely on it as a guide to get to a specific place.
0792839749|5.0|Loved it as a kid, Love it  even now as an adult.  One to watch on a rainy day or any day for that matter.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I really love this great red stylish cover for my Kindle.  It is a very nice design and looks like expensive leather.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Uber talented musicians creating a unique sound that will always stay with you. I loved it when it came out in the 90s and love it all over again. Awesome live footage. Impeccable sound. Love!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game keeps your mind active and your eyes moving. I really enjoyed it....when will I be getting some new floors
B005DC68NI|5.0|Gaughran spells it out and breaks it down. Everything you need to know to get started for self-publishing. A must read!
B00821OX98|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised when I started watching this show. Didn't really know anything about it, other than the fact that it wasn't available anywhere else for free. This show has a great plot, and it has great character development. The special effects are decent enough for a tv show. I originally came in being hesitant to watch for fear of low budget graphics, but it turned out that they were decent enough for me to keep watching. Overall, great show. I'd prefer it over the Walking Dead in an instant; there's not nearly as much stupidity and overdramatic characters to constantly be annoyed with. Not that the Walking Dead is a bad show (it's one of my favorites), but it is the closest comparison I can make with my list of post-apocalyptic shows I've seen.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Thought it was a really good first season.  Really like Ragnar's character.  If you like Vikings then I think you'd like this show.  Seems to be a lot of realistic customs involved.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very captivating game. Love the critical thinking aspect. Hints would be a nice feature for some levels, or for the next step.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|One of my fav childhood movies and the VHS version I have is beyond worn out so had to buy the DVD. Maggie Smith does an amazing job in it like everything else she's in. I think this movie is a must see for any 90s babies out there
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I love the books, and perhaps that's my problem.  This film is derivative and tries too hard to tie in to the Lord of the Rings, when the story is fully capable of standing on it's own (as it always has).  Also - breaking it into 3 films?  When the Lord of the Rings was completed in 3?  Neither me nor my wife could stay awake during this.  I expected to be disappointed, and I was.  I didn't expect to be so thoroughly disappointed, though.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's fun. I was getting tired of the first Angry Birds , but never did complete all levels. This game is different, but still getting more difficult to play.  Get this 71 year old brain stirred up.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Installed the app. Waited a few seconds. Screen shoes what needed to be cleaned by category. Pushed the button Bam
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is an excellent writer. I have enjoyed all of his novels and highly recommend each of his books!
B00563K3DA|5.0|It's a very good runbook to build a pure spirit for life. I encourage everyone to adapt the techniques for better life.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I am in the same level. I could have played for free instaed of paying for a game this not working. Please fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy just play for free.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This is an intelligent and thoughtful presentation of social dilemmas we currently face wrapped in a captivating story. She has a great command of the English language and uses it to provide nuanced insight to issues and characters.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I had low expectations for this but was pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of tongue-in-cheek about this film and they pull it wonderfully.<br /><br />I only give 5 stars to films I would enjoy watching again.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As excellent as everyone say it is. Can't wait to read the net books in the series. So good indeed
B0011MZOEI|5.0|This was a really good episode of the franchise. Willis has the character down and the script gave him something to do with it. Directing and editing is spot of for this genre and Willis's style.<br /><br />I only give films 5 stars if I would enjoy watching it again.
B009O07NDY|5.0|My husband is a HUGE fan of Lord of the Rings.  He loves this CD and plays it a lot.  Probably too much.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|It's the one of the best free games I have ever had its really fun the sound the graphics are all there
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I am not a Rush fan, but my husband is.  This was on his wish list.  He had also been talking about what an amazing concert this was supposed to have been and how this album is supposed to be some really big deal in the world of Rush fans.  So of course, I bought it for him as a surprise.  He loves it and talks about it all the time.  It has very good sound quality for a life show. Great gift for the Rush fans in your life.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved the grafix good story line very creepy some puzzles were a tad confusing but I truly liked the gAme.

B00066VUPM|3.0|Only liked the song Why does it always rain on me. heard it sung on pbs british sitcom William and Mary, was well done but didn't like rest of songs on cd .
B001HN694K|5.0|did not think that I would like the movie, but did and had to get the dvd,it was interesting and actually loved the movie.so I had to buy it
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Not a bad little scanner. Used it for a few hundred 35mm slides. Does a good job. You will need small needle nose pliers to quickly remove the slides.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I got this from Big Fish for my pc, delighted to find Kindle version. Only negative.....I don't get anything else done .....just love playing!!!!<br />Just fun.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I was having trouble with my Kindle Fire and I was advised by Kindle support to download this to get online easier.It does open up right away but is slow to post.Also no edit button when you are writing a post so you are stuck with your mistakes sort of.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I liked this movie a lot. I thought it flowed well from the first Iron Man and the main actor are in the second one. Overall a good movie and a good addition to your dvds.
0812975219|5.0|Challenging and mind expanding, yet pleasant and entertaining; very well written. A must for anyone who wants to develop critical and independent thinking.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I've had The Weather Channel on my Kindle since they first came out.  It was simple to use and I had no complaints.  Now it's too busy and that reward thing is annoying.  So after I'm done with this review I'll delete this app and look for a new weather app.
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|The insight in this book is easily digestable and actionable. The real life examples also make for a very easy and enjoyable read.
B0026772N8|1.0|I had to really slog through the book. A motorcycle mechanic but definitely not dad material. Definitely not QUALITY reading!!!!!
B00122A28A|2.0|This is a re-review. I've done some personal research with this album, and gave it another chance. I simply just cannot get into it. Main reason; the music. The content of the album is standard. It's interesting how a few touch-ups & adjustments through DJ'ing and remixing can entirely improve a song -- giving the listener a different perspective all together.<br /><br />I tend to prefer the more raw or cutting-edge, Madonna. I look for these things when following up with her craft. Much of what I consider Madonna's 'ideal' form is not present in 'Ray of Light'. Like, Music, and American Life, 'Ray of Light' has put me to sleep.<br /><br />Madonna has switched gears, this is not the issue. The issue lies in the arrangments, which are not the best of their kind. I've heard better forms of trip-hop, or lounge-y pop music within my lifetime, Ray of light is not 'it'. Like, 'Music', this album is a sub-genre of dance, but still a sub-genre of its very own. It's an album that would play with recessed lighting, light cocktails, evening attire, and the use of indoor voices. It isn't an album I would tune into, daily. It's something you 'hear', but don't actually 'listen' to -- if you're able to grasp that concept.<br /><br />Some major strongpoints are missing throughout this record. The passion in her singing is not present in the studio-versions of these recordings. There are no vocal standouts. On occasion there tends to be some heart in the matter, but it is limited. Tuning into some of the album's live performances of 'Frozen', and/or 'Power of Goodbye' showcases the range that's non-existant on the actual album. You'll notice her voice has not changed much since 1989-1994. Yet, her studio recordings of these songs suggests, otherwise. There is a distinction in the studio & live vocals between the 'Ray of light' and 'EVITA'  album releases. It's almost as if she's channeling Barbra Streisand in her vocal style, this cannot be denied. She's never sang this way in any other era of her career -- before or after the Ray/Evita era. She was definitely having a Barbra moment, which makes sense considering the shift in vocal style came about with Evits. Is noone else hearing the Barbra cloning? She's been paying close attention to those streisand records, I'm surprised noone else has mentioned this. Nothing wrong with it, but can be a bit pathetic at times when all you want to hear is Madonna. Especially, If you're not a Barbra fan [no pun].<br /><br />I believe this album would've had greater appeal had she incorporated a bit of her stage vocals in the actual album work.<br /><br />Although, this album does nothing for me at all, I have the utmost respect for it. I respect the art of it, and the need to evolve as an artist, taking different strokes.<br /><br />Initially, I did feel the album was terrible, but it's not the songs that I don't like, It's the music that I don't like. I know this because I was online and stumbled across a remix of Candy Perfume Girl, I could not believe what I was hearing. The remix has a hip-hop undertone with a grunge-y feel to it. I think Alanis Morrisette would be quite proud. This is exactly what I had in mind while purchasing this album, a sound with more edge and intensity. I began to stumble upon several remixes with 'Swim' being another one. The 'Swim' remix [again] shares the hip-hop/grunge formula of CPG, but this time with a mix of industrial sounds, baring even more edge. After all these years I said to myself 'this is it, this is the (Ray of Light) album I wanted all along', it was perfect.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I enjoyed the Sticky & Sweet tour version of the 'Ray of Light' track. The pitch was taken down w/ a slightly less aggressive sound. A bit more bubblegum, creating more melody and a dance-y edge. I personally never liked the original versions of anything on this album. As I mentioned before, this album is something you've got to have a taste, or mood for. It isn't a basic, or traditional pop record -- nothing wrong with that, I wouldve preferred better craftsmanship with the music, which ive found on my own through remixes, club mixes, live versions, and so on.<br /><br />Little Star' caught my attention when schimming through the album, but the music seems to be a coarse grade than what the song calls for. 'I know' its what they were going for, 'I get it'. 'Nothing really matters' touched me for a moment, but something seems to be missing. I like the contemporary/dance vibe, but it has no charge. Unfortunately, there are no good remixes for this particular track -- at least none that I've managed to come find.<br /><br />I own all the remixes for 'Music', 'American Life', and 'Hard Candy' and it's fascinating what a 'club mix', and some rearranging can do for a song. I can listen to these remixes as if theyre the originals. The original formula for these albums are just not the same. As Ive said time, and time again -- if Madonna's albums aren't cutting it go for the remixes, they never seem to fail....<br /><br />Last, and certainly not least -- the Drowned World Tour does this album great justice! There's added elements in much of the songs that are not present in the originals (the album/studio versions). Candy Perfume Girl is a rocked out version of the song, the performance is wicked an extremely thin Man, or contortionist performs in a spotlight to the sound of the daring music while Madonna's stands still playing her guitar, and giving us what we need. I think this is the 'Silent Remix' done live, the title is an oxymoron, as it is not silent at all. Another great twist from Drowned World would be the 'Mer Girl/Across the sky' contraction -- I think the live versions of these two songs together create more passion, and she's actually singing with more effort which adds to the experience. Especially, from all the moving-around & dancing she did on that tour; she was slightly winded, as a result the singing contains more effort. She doesnt sound as nonchalant like she does on the album (I hate that), and again the remixes are better too<br /><br />I rewrote this entire review, it was more judgemental =)referred better craftsmanship with the music, which ive found on my own through remixes, club mixes, live versions, and so on.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is much better than the movie.  I cannot wait to read the next one.  Missed a lot of sleep the past few days staying up and reading.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Cleese, as always, is hilariously brilliant! These 12 episodes of his post Monty Python venture into more conventional SIT COM territory, all play up both his physical and cerebral shenanigans to the max.  Always cowering to his wife's constant reminders of his failed strategies to improve things at their shore side hotel, Basil Fawlty's (Cleese) continuous passive aggressive snarling and snake tongued barbs aimed at co-star Prunella Scales (playing his wife), are priceless.  Even if you weren't a fan of the Pythons, you will love these shows and want to watch them over and over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it teaches me how to care for horses and I love horses a lot. The horses in this game are very realistic and I love playing this game everyday.

B0052AC8C6|4.0|Found myself wondering about the mix of animal types interacting. Not sure why, that doesn't normally come up while watching an animated flick - we are supposed to suspend disbelief. Kind of jarring and takes one out of the story when that happens.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Another perspective on life after death, or more appropriately, the true reality of what always is present.  An interesting approach of writing what was happening to his body while his consciousness was in another place.  Whether you agree of disagree with his vision, it is a unique possibility that lends itself to the expanding field of direct experiencing a deeper reality.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I am of the opinion that songs and movies should not be covered (remade) unless it is better than the original. Just updating to current time does not do it. That is all they have done here - best. They made some of the characters a little closer to real human behavior instead of so stereotypically (Hollywierd) bad in the original so that redeems it some.
B001LM1456|4.0|New to the Marvel Universe and found the movie entertaining and fun. It was a good introduction to the Avengers.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game to play when you are board it passes Time and is great for you kids as well.great game.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|In this novel, Gaiman perfectly recreates the surreal quality of childhood in which reality and fantasy co-mingle.  The story begins as the narrator revisits the neighborhood where he grew up and remembers an event that ruptured the innocence of his early years: the sucide of a boarder his family had taken in, a man who had accidentally run over the narrator's kitten and taken over his room in the house.  He takes refuge in the home of a neighbor girl, Lettie, who lives with her mother and grandmother in a farmhouse at the end of the lane.  While they appear normal on the surface,  these women are anything but, and the body of water that looks like a pond turns out to also have magical qualities.  He and Lettie go on an adventure during which he accidentally brings back a spirit from another world who, while apparently well-meaning, begins to cause all manner of trouble in the young narrator's life.  What's magical and enrapturing about this novel the way Gaiman captures the inner terrors and surreal qualities of a child's point of view.  If you liked _Coraline_, _Neverwhere_ and any of Gaiman's other novels, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use the reading plan daily. Love the multiple translations available for study. Word lookup has helped me find an illusive verse or two.

B000007MVM|5.0|I didn't know Syd Barrett's work outside pink floyd and I feel totally satisfied after listening this album, full of wonderful melodies.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|For mindless entertainment I like the Reacher novels.  The character is an interesting shell of a man who basically travels on buses with no fixed address because that is cheaper than buying a house and no one can know his whereabouts.  But beyond this and boasting about his prowess he has little to say.  In A Wanted Man he crisscrosses numerous states about 50 times too many for my interest, always proving to any cop willing to listen that the cop is wrong.  About mid way through this book I got a little tired of Reacher.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down. The suspense, humor and crafty style of John Corey kept the pages turning with great reward
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|just like the game called tumble run. I have had it for 2 days now. I am going to delete. there's no mission. unlike other games. I will give this app( game ) a 0 stars. I HATE IT
B0063IH60K|3.0|This app plays well and offers lots of options. My only real complaint is that although the app features a &quot;Custom Background&quot; option, it won't accept any of the photos I've downloaded onto my Kindle. If I knew what resolution the photos must be, or if this can be fixed, I'd give 5 stars!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Man you gotta try this game out its epic its all about blocks you can survive and go on a game mode called creative where you get unlimited blocks and can fly can cant die man and it only costs a little bit of money!
0316077046|5.0|I am really enjoying this series, guess  I am spellbound by the story, not my typical read, but the story line is really good. when I read the first book, Beautiful Creatures, I was very disappointed by the movie, they changed way to much and left too much out, I like the two characters they chose for Lena and Ethan. hope they don't butcher this one if they make it into a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is the first app I got on my kindle fire!!!!!!!!! it was great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wow!!!!!!!!! cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not best ever!!!!!! but still good!!!!!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Great Action, Quite a twist on the original story, a fun flick for the older set. Good for a night of action to watch.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I've seen the previews for this show for the last two years but I never took the time to watch it. My husband suggested that we watch it, and so this week we have been binge-watching season 1 and 2. It's a well-scripted and well-acted show.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This one never gets old! One to watch more than once. Alfred Hitchcock was a master story weaver. Clsed captions would be great for hearing impaired.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|The characters are not caricatures and the plot twists and turns in ways that surprise you. Good story. Keep them coming.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Hannibal is one of the most clever crime-ish shows I have seen in forever, I think what sets this apart from any other series is that we all know the end of this story, yet watching it unfold and wondering how it unravels is brilliant.
B00006RAKP|3.0|When I was searching for a tape of Elton John I was hoping for one that had quite a few of his songs I had heard and enjoyed such as I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues, Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Daniel, Philadelphia Freedom and Pinball Wizard. This one had least had all those or maybe all but Pinball Wizard. It also had others I liked such as Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Can Yo Feel the Love Tonight?, but it also had lots I didn't remember hearing before and found I didn't like many of them. I ended up putting the discs back in the box and am now wondering what to do with it except play it again. I guess I would be better off with one or two smaller CDs of his that don't have so many tracks I don't recall in order to be more pleased with my choice.
0812523008|5.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 1995 COLLECTION [[ASIN:0812523008 I Am Legend]]<br /><br /> The world has ended, everybody is dead, kinda, and now Robert Neville is alone, all alone, kinda.  The solitude and tragedy has made him a chain smoker and a haunted alcoholic.  He is not without his own form of company however, every night he is besieged by the walking dead who are just sentient enough to know Neville as their enemy and as their prey.  However they are not sentient enough to know how to get at him, and so, night after night it becomes a stand-off between the two; them outside, and Neville inside his fortified household.  And the situation is wearing Neville down.<br /><br /> \\"I Am Legend\\" takes place over four distinct time periods; January and March 1976, June 1978, and January 1979.  This novel starts off as a post-apocalyptic siege story, moves into a medical science fiction thriller as Neville decides to investigate the plague, find out how it operates, and finding out that there are two types of vampires, the dead and the near dead, and eventually moves into a critique of religion, blind belief, and mythology.  Eventually, as the days move on, Neville falls into routine, and then one day he meets somebody, somebody who also may be immune to the disease.  And this begins to awaken feelings in him that he had thought long dead.<br /><br /> The plot by now is very familiar to most; however, to put things in context, this novel was probably born of the dreaded polio scares of the early part of the last century, as this was the first novel to treat vampirism overtly as a commutable disease.  When this novel was first published it was given middling reviews; however time has proven these reviewers wrong as it has become one of the most influential novels published in the last century.<br /><br /> One of the things that this novel brings to the forefront, and surprisingly enough, it would take a pop vampire movie (the original version of the [[ASIN:B000WN4MVS Fright Night]] [\\". . . you have to believe . . . \\"]) to popularize the heart of this novel's philosophy.  That is, most of what we know about vampirism is based in psychology; it is our inner faith that causes most of the vampire's behavior.  Afraid of the cross?  This is because of the vampire's faith in Christianity when alive; Jewish vampires would be afraid of the Star of David.  Can't see themselves in the mirror?  This is hysterical blindness, and as this turns out to be an atheist vampire novel, it would be a long desired nail in the coffin of the faith-based, gothic oriented, vampire story.  Don't look to God for help; he ain't home when humanity knocked on his door when it needed him.<br /><br /> This is the novel that would not only influence, directly and indirectly, literature, but movies and television as well.  You can see where this novel influenced other genres, starting with [[ASIN:B001KSLG40 Night of the Living Dead]], and moving on to almost all zombie and quasi-zombie novels and films.<br /><br /> The Tor movie tie-in edition also contains ten extra stories, and this is much like getting a CD and finding that it has extra bonus tracks.  Cool.  Too bad there are readers out there that don't have the brain matter to figure out where one story starts and another ends.<br /><br /> A number of these stories are genuine bona-fide classics.  Matheson wrote some great stories over the years, and besides the title novel, other stories in this collection have been filmed.<br /><br />********There are two stories dealing with funeral parlors and both try for humor.  'The Near Departed' reads like a trunk story from the fifties.  It just couldn't happen today, and besides it was done on \\"Night Gallery\\" better ('The Late Mr. Peddington', 1972), on the other hand 'The Funeral' was also done on \\"Night Gallery\\" (1972) and it is genuinely funny.  Not great, but fun nonetheless.<br /><br />********There are two stories dealing with African mythology and religion, andboth are classics.  'Prey' (filmed 1975/1983/1996) deals with a young woman with an overbearing mother, who brings home a possessed Zuni hunting doll.  Soon there is a life and death fight between her and the rampaging doll.  Long before [[ASIN:B0016BRGZY The Exorcist]], 'From Shadowed Places' deals with a rich man who becomes cursed by an evil African Ngombo and the young African-American female professor who has to save him.  Supposedly the rituals described are authentic, there is an interesting subtext of friendship between the white girlfriend of the rich man and the black woman back when the South was still proudly holding on to the tradition of lynching.<br /><br />********'Person To Person' (filmed 2011) is another possession and haunting story.  Millman is hearing a telephone ringing in his head at three o'clock every night.  Is he possessed, haunted, or insane?  The story is short, and the ending is a bit unexpected, and so the ending will have to be interpreted by the story's readers.<br /><br />********Matheson has written extensively about haunted houses ([[ASIN:0553072773 Hell House (Bantam Horror, N7277)]]) and in 'Mad House' he puts a new spin on the idea.  A man is having a bad day, the keys in his typewriter get stuck, three times, he cuts his throat while shaving, twice, gets dental floss stuck in his teeth, twice, and he can't cut his food with his knife.  He's also a deeply angry and bitter man who blames all of his faults and problems on everybody else.  His house has been drenched in his anger, and now the house is fighting back.<br /><br />********'Dress Of White Silk' is another of Matheson's odd children stories, try Ray Bradbury having gone terribly, terribly wrong, as here a somewhat backward child sees reality in a different manner than others, with ghastly results.<br /><br />********'Dance Of The Dead', filmed in 2005 as [[ASIN:B002MS4DSS Dance Of The Dead - Tobe Hooper]], was originally published in [[ASIN:B002EY68UG Star Science Fiction Stories No. 3]], the \\"Star\\" series of original anthologies presaged both Damon Knight's \\"Orbit\\" and Harlan Ellison's \\"Dangerous Visions\\" anthologies in both content and literacy.  Post, an unnamed, apocalyptic war, this story deals with four college kids who go slumming to a seedy downtown bar where they drink and watch the Loopies dance.  These are the walking dead, infected during the war, and now exploited for giggles and bucks.  Fans of Joe R. Lansdale should like this story about a young woman's loss of innocence.<br /><br />********'Witch War' was published during the Korean War and is a \\"superman\\" type story that was probably aimed at John W. Campbell's \\"Astounding Stories\\", but if so, it probably gave Campbell fits.  Three adorable young girls just wanna have fun, but they got psychic powers and during an unnamed war they are used as killing machines.  Their cuteness is contrasted by their viciousness.  A weird war story that horrifies because of the utter banalness of its protagonists.<br /><br /> For those who are interested, this 1995 collection shows why Richard Matheson became an influence on such people as Stephen King and Steven Spielberg (Matheson's \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode [[ASIN:B005HQLSHG Little Girl Lost]] was borrowed by Spielberg to become [[ASIN:B00471TLZS Poltergeist]]).<br /><br /> There are those who won't get these stories.  Forget 'em, they're dead to the world anyway.  This is a great collection for those who want to look at a writer who was there to help, along with Ray Bradbury and Charles Beaumont, horror transit from its gothic trapping into a the modern genre that it is today. Sadly as I started reading this collection Richard Matheson (1926/02/20-2013/06/23) passed away, he was one of the two or three authors that I turned to instead of drugs during the sixties.  He was also the last surviving author of the seminal anthology [[ASIN:0765305372 The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Vol. 1: 1929-1964]], which is, oddly enough, reviewed by me on this site.tion Stories No. 3]], the \\"Star\\" series of original anthologies presaged both Damon Knight's \\"Orbit\\" and Harlan Ellison's \\"Dangerous Visions\\" anthologies in both content and literacy.

B004FOA84A|1.0|This game is very boring. It seems like each room has only two objects or two activities, there are no hints if you get stuck. Graphics are very lame.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I just think this is a great movie. I love the art, the music, and the feel of this movie and the meaning behind the story. Such a classic! And in my opinion this version is well done.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed this game. I could not put it down. I cannot wait for the next room. It was challenging and creative.
B00BESIKWM|5.0|My brother said it continues to follow the video game really well. And somehow magically they were able to make this movie just as good as the first, which does not happen in the cinema too often.<br /><br />I'll continue to keep watching!
B0000667RO|5.0|Love Bryan Adams, great album. Easy to listen too, there is plenty of variety. Love his soulful voice and guitar work.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Very different sound than their previous albums but it still does not disappoint.<br /><br />Honestly, it took me a bit to get used to this new sound. It is so much more mature than Horchata (which I still love). In the end, it is still them and goes to show how as musicians they can continue to please.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love the story that is unfolding, but can't believe you're leaving us hanging like this. Can't wait for the next book!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|As silly as it sounds, I began waitressing and actually used this game to help me.<br /><br />It's very fun but can get frustrating when you don't win, much like angry birds haha
B002H5HJ9G|3.0|Ed Norton is lackluster in the lead, Anthony Hopkins is still the scariest serial killer on film but the movie did not live up to the book.
B009IQ0TGM|2.0|Following one of the other reviews that casually compared this singer to Adele, I gave this CD a shot.  I have no doubt that if I was a 14 year old girl, this artist would appeal greatly to me- as the music is loaded with that bubble gum pop sound that seems to be so popular these days.  However,  if your'e a longtime music lover who appreciates quality lyrics and more serious music, this may not be for you.  I'm not saying she is a bad singer - just maybe marketed for a different audience.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|great album gift for a great price. came on schedule and it was perfect for what i needed and when i needed it.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|Great album by great DJ's! I'm really sad they had to break up but im glad i got to see them on their last tour. I love all the songs on this album.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|great album gift for a great price. came on schedule and it was perfect for what i needed and when i needed it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the story, although I felt, at times, that it was too long, too wordy and that Mr. Hosseini did not quite know when to stop &#34;talking&#34;.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|We saw this movie on You-tube and as lousy and grainy the picture was, we watched the whole thing in one day.<br />As soon as we found it on Amazon, we had to buy it!  Great story and great actors too!
075669812X|5.0|My four year old grandson loves it!  This is a great reference book for any Ninjago fan; it has colorful photos of all of the characters.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Saw this movie at the theater and had to buy it and watch it again!  Great actors, great movie.  Lots of laughs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so far Paris is my favorite on subway surfers I.would reccomend this game to anyone love it!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Funniest game when it worked. Stopped opening this morning. Must be going to go from free to pay...couldn't believe it was free in the first place.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I usually nod off during Jane Austin. this had some slow moments, but i enjoyed it. Not very deep, but pleasant
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoying this MahJong while bored &amp; waiting.  Visually clear for tired eyes especially.  I will continue to obsess &amp; complete.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|If you want to see some great acting - watch this series.  Kevin Bacon is fantastic!!  Good for people who like murder mystery type programs.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 4 year old and 2 year old really enjoyed this. My four year old understood the humor and thought it was really silly. She giggled throughout. My 2 year old loved the minions!
B00CATSONE|4.0|i like it, it is very good book for its price. i definatelly recoment it. Tesla was a grate man
B003SI3URQ|3.0|We watched this for a movie night with our 4 and 2 year old. They didn't seem to hold their attention like other Disney classics we've watched.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|Had this movie before on VHS - makes you wonder about people - they never changed-only the cloths changed-Thank you
B00CWY76CC|2.0|it is not hard but it is challenging but it is a really good game. it makes you think about the game and what your suppose to do next.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|If you stop and think about people today<br />People still give other people the power to control them-what makes them think they know more then me?<br />Never go away with out your children- he was lucky-
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I'm a fan of these kind of movies and this was is decent - I enjoyed it and it's worth a watch
0767817710|5.0|Power of one man with a big mouth-and a child grown up never to forget her past can shut his big mouth for good.<br />A real strong group of actors - pulled it together - and it became - an eye opener - on many emotional levels
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This game works well in the kindle edition but the game itself is not that entertaining.  It is however a great way to pass the time when you are bored.
B007ZRZF8I|2.0|this game was hard and a little bit boring:( all you need to do is go up and down and try to get away from this guy:( it's not that fun:(
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.....it has some comic relief at times, suspense almost all the time........I really enjoyed this book and will recommend it to my friends.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love to play this game it is very fun! I'm always geting higher scores every time! get the game! I hope they put more stages on the game! :)
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was difficult to read as the words depicted an uneducated farmer using much slang along with a heavy Irish accent.  I found myself re-reading the words to understand what was being said.  The story also kept bouncing around from present to past time periods, making it a bit challenging to follow.  I'm glad I forced myself to continue reading it as it was an interesting story, worth the read.  You just need to have some patience with this one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|If your a were's  my water fan and a Perry fan you should buy this game! It is worth the money.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I love the Twilight novels, but I waited to get the DVDs until I could get them almost dirt cheap. It was worth waiting to pay less than $10. Product came quickly and without issue.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I liked this game when I played it but it was pretty hard:( :) that's why I gave it a three. I played the first level and it was ok. I uninstalled it quick though. but if you like it get the game!<br />  :)
0756655307|5.0|Another one, this is for my son for Christmas, he will think this is fantastic. I love the value for money that you get with DK Books and products.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I loved this game when I got it!! it was hard and super fun!!:) I got lots of coins and new things! I wish I could give it more stars!! BUY THIS GAME!!!  :)  :)  it's a really good game!!!  :)
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really like that I can shop while on the go.  However the barcode scan does not work that great on all items.  I scanned 4 items in the store to compare prices while being on Wi-Fi and it was unable to view results.  But when I typed in the item name it worked.<br />So hit or miss.  But I like to quickly add things to my wish list.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is fun and hard! it is also addicting! but I love it! you should get the game! the good thing is it is free!!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I did not like linking with friends on the game however it is always great to keep up with friends scores and levels.  Too much information needed.  Not everyone has Facebook. Bummer.
0385486804|5.0|After watching the movie I was thrilled to start reading the book. Although more of a biography and different narrative than the movie, it was a very good read. Told in fairly good detail about Chris McCandless's life and adventure, and experiences of the people he met along the way. Good to read if you want to learn what not to do if going into Alaska's wilderness alone!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I wish there were more features.  Maybe with the non-free version.  Great to have a handy note pad when you need to jot down a quick note.  Also it stores better than my smartphone's calendar.<br />Worth downloading for quick note taking.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is the second time I have seen this movie, and I absolutely loved it! It is a great go to movie if you're having guys over or just want to watch again.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I did not find this helpful my stock battery indicator on my smartphone works better than this app.  This is just my personal opinion.  I have archived this in my cloud.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game every evening during the commercials of my favorite shows. Love trying to get to the next puzzle piece. Great fun!
B004LZFWJO|3.0|I downloaded this with hopes of this being similar to The famous game Candy Crush Saga.  Nothing like it.  It is great for a pastime.  However, if you are comparing it to Candy Crush no comparison.  Looks great on a larger screen.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I'm 56 what am I doing watching a high school show? Enjoying the great TV that's what! I'm glad I own them now.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A great game to pass time.  But like anything after playing for awhile it is just another game.  I will say it is fun.
B003VVAE4W|5.0|Wow Was I surprised how much I liked this show and as a second season I was impressed they kept up the quality.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This is not as reliable as the Android original alarm clock that is installed on my phone.  However, I will use this while on vacation.<br />Not the best but not the worse either.  Give it a try; you may like it.  Maybe my network connection could have been very low.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|not as good as the first two seasons but still great TV. they messed up canceling this one. I hope the movie is as good.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The update is terrible. Information is not complete and difficult to navigate.  I have removed this app and am looking for a more friendly version. My suggestion is not to waste your time on this.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I was a fan of Band of Brothers for the longest time, and when I saw the first episode of The Pacific, I was instantly addicted. Great series!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good app. I have weatherbug the paid version on my phone and was hoping the app for kindle was the same but sadly mistaken... I found this one after several attempts of other free apps and may even purchase the ad free version eventually...
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've been a fan of Band of Brothers for a long time, but never had the chance to own the whole set. Great series!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Game keeps my attention, graphics could be a little better and level design, but it was free so whatever. Keep it up.
B000FC10HA|5.0|This is my top 3 marketing books. A book that I will be studying every year and so should you.<br /><br />Every marketer and entrepreneur should have this book in their library. It was referred to me by a very successful entrepreneur. No wonder, he's successful.<br /><br />Buy 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing to aid you in making your enterprise or product a success.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to navigate and fun for all ages. no problems yet. The competitions are great, but need a faster way to earn gems.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My ten year old granddaughter loves figuring out these puzzles. She plays this as much as Wheres<br />Perry and Water.
B008R4ZCY0|4.0|But, I must say that overall the cd is very good, there is some almost mood music on there I still can't get into. Yes, his guitar work is like no other, and yes, the musicianship is amazing as always, some of this release will have to grow on me to give it 5 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game for the whole family! the kids love it and so do the adults! only downside was how long it took to download... but other than that- excellent!!!
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|One of the best since the release of Promised Land, for me. Strong songs, musicianship and vocals but the band has never been the same since Chris DeGarmo left the band. I enjoyed the varied styles of songs and that they actually have a couple of faster tunes here. Let Rockenfield shine!!!!! By far the winner of the two Ryche albums released this year!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|this is a great idea, especially for me as a senior . easy to use. the  HD camera will add a lot of fun for a family.
B0042EJD8A|1.0|Amazing how people eagerly believe what they want to instead of looking at any facts.<br />The peoples water in Penn that supposedly was contaminated was determined to be clean by the Penn EPA.  The supposed contract that Josh Fox had was false.<br />Most of this movie has been discredited as not true or just falsified and the rest just wild speculation. Most people who are against fracking don't have a clue how it really works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the greatest thing.  I love the minions. I like you have to fight against the other evil people like Vector.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another awesome book by James Rollins. I love that he takes me on adventures all over the world. I just can't get enough...I love it!! I can't help but to do research on locations in his books, places that I have never heard of but turn out to be beautiful. Keep it up and I look forward to your next book, either Sigma on stand alone book!!
B000I186FW|4.0|This drama is pretty applicable to our times.  Enjoyable, a bit gothic, albeit science fiction.  Pretty entertaining for a low budget offering.
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|Borrrrrrrrring not worth ten cents.  Don t waste your time.  Exrcrusiating details that aren t worth knowing.<br />Story goes no where.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun. It is a fun game to play for kids and older people. This game is fun for all people.
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|This is one of televisions premiere show. Well written ana acted. Well worth the money. If you like drama I advise that you watch this series.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|got this game for my grandson. it has been great....until they updated. lost everything and now freezes up everytime you try to play. and now you have to merge with facebook. this stinks
034552554X|5.0|Quite a gripping story.  Hard to imagine someone living this way, but what a happy ending.  Good read for anyone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What a great testimony of faith and science blending together.  We will use part of this book in our Sunday School for reflection and study.
B00BXVKKPA|4.0|After hearing \\"Runnin' Wild,\\" I could tell Airbourne was going to be a band that stuck tightly to a sex, drugs, and rock and roll theme to their music. Their first album was like that. Their second album was like that. This album is like that. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing. This is a good album. True, it is essentially a continuation of their first two albums, but they did some different things with this album. The song \\"Hungry\\" has a Spanish sounding intro to it leading into some heavy palm muting that reminds me of Metallica. They also slowed down \\"Cradle to the Grave\\" a bit which is something they don't often do. In the end, it's a good record, but nothing special.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Played another big title TCG style game for kindle and found it near impossible to enjoy playing but thing keeps me hooked for hours.  Great fun, well worth the download.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like this game but it needs several more combinations for someone who wants to play for several hours at a time.

B00AM7E4P8|5.0|What an appetite stirring read!<br /><br />An insightful and engaging exploration into the history, philosophy, science and methods of the culinary craft. Pollan once again displays his ability to seamlessly weave different facts and ideas together to form a powerful narrative about human's relationship to nature as bridged by the act of cooking. I know I will never look at a dish or food product the same way again!<br /><br />I have to admit though, it did took a while for me to take to the book (and I did complained about it!), but maybe Pollan's fondness of slow cooking was transposed to his writing. \\"Cooked\\" is definitely a book that you'd want to savour with intent, as it gets more and more interesting and fascinating with each turn of the page. In the end, it all redeemed for what seemed to me like a laggard start.<br /><br />I also loved that he even touched on some of the political economy, ethical and social issues accompanying some of the culinary crafts. Enough for it to be though provoking without overwhelming the unsuspecting reader.<br /><br />This book should go into every foodie's must-read list.
1451695195|5.0|I have shared this with key persons in my life.  It is a significant read!  I recommend it highly -- it will have a lasting effect.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I give it 1 star because whenever I try to open it, it goes back to the menu and its really annoying.
B0001I562I|4.0|It's funny when you look back at movies you loved when you were a kid, how very different they seems as an adult. This is certainly true of this movie especially when you look at the &#34;state of the art&#34; technology back in the 80s. I pose this little question: How did an advanced drone from far beyond our level of technology not blow our simple technology out of the water? How did a super intelligent drone lose it's memory files by encountering a power line? Somehow, someway, the drone was able to implant information in a childs brain which allowed him to communite with our primative computers in binary code. Technical problems asside, it's still a cute movie and I still like it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a fun and brain challenging game. Trying to figure out the clues and where stuff is so much fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We are hooked!  The writers have helped us know so many characters.  We dread running out of catch-up episodes, and having to wait like everyone else.

B00498XRPE|5.0|My girlfriend mentioned that she had not seen any of the Alien movies after I bought Prometheus on Bluray. I decided to stream the original in HD. I'm glad I spent a little extra to see it in high res. It still looks great. Sure loved it and we just bought the whole anthology.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Very entertaining and wonderfully written. Everyone should read this and make this apart of their bookshelf so they can re-visit it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Creepy and complex. This is the best game I have played so far on my Kindle Fire HD. It takes a little time to load up but only because the graphics are so detailed. Definitely worth buying. Just when you think you've solved a puzzle, you get another one.  Very well thought out. I loved it and can't wait for the next game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|just the right amount of brainpower to keep it interesting and the clues were very clever! I wish there were more levels.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|except for the image controls being somewhat dificult to operate on the tablet i would have given it a rating of 5 stars

B0095G5AFU|4.0|Good app I have all note books in one place - meeting notes, lesson ideas, journal - and can access easily.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is a tear jerker I can tell you that much. It is simply wonderful in ways of a teenager about to go in to high school not knowing who the  be and what they will do. I cannot express to you how much closure this gave to me. Thank you.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love the first two quell games, but quell memento is far better. I found myself stretching out the puzzles to make it last as long as possible. It has all of the addictive qualities of the first two versions with several new kinds of tasks and rewards. I really hope they produce a fourth game. And then a fifth, and a sixth...
B000P407K4|5.0|The dialogue still sizzles.  Full of quotable quotes. Peter Sellers is at his peak is his portrayal of three important characters.  Still political dynamite. Lots of laughs, sighs, groans.  Sadly still relevant to today's politics
B00C90T4QK|5.0|If you're a Michael Bublé fan you won't be disappointed. This just continues his run of great stuff. Refreshing to hear a real singer these days.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Always enjoy this type of games. It has its mystery but easy to play. Rarely had to use the hints but if you need it , it's there.
1593975457|5.0|I have always loved James Herriot's books and especially enjoy the unabridged recordings for long-distance traveling.  With a good book in the CD player the miles roll past.  Herriot's wonderful writing style is both soothing and stimulating, and Christopher Timothy's recordings have become the standard I expect.  I was very glad to be able to purchase this since my library has stopped carrying many of its audio books in favor of MP3 downloads or Kindle books.  Thanks.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lady Mary rises to the occasion as her love for Matthew tames her selfish side,  They find each other although shaded by death of an innocent. Sybil is another innocent lost to arrogance and Branson becomes a true noble because her love gave him strength
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I felt like the movie was long. I feel asleep.  Overall the story was hard to follow.  Also the costume design was weird...
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Good photography, good sound quality.  Did not really understand what was happening until the movie was over.  I find that typical of movies made in the last several years.  However, we will never miss a Tommy Lee Jones movie.  Interesting how much Ned Beatty has changed since his appearance in &#34;Deliverance&#34;, a movie I did understand.
1400069807|5.0|An outstanding book that combines psychology, history, nutrition, sociology and yes some actual hard science to show how America has sold its soul (and health) in terms of food consumption to behemoth corporations that tweak their food products and advertising campaigns for maximum sales.  The author takes us back to the early days of mass food production and conducts some fascinating interviews with many of the early innovators in this arena.  Unfortunately he also buys into the popularly accepted but not scientifically grounded \\"facts\\" about nutrition including the dangers of fats (for the best evidence see 'Good Calories, Bad Calories' by Gary Taubes).  Overall this is a book well worth reading that changed my perception of food marketing and how I shop when I am at the grocery store.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|I sorely miss the old Kyuss/early QOTSA sound. But there’s plenty of bands to scratch that itch. The fact is that the band remains awesome in pretty much every way, and I totally respect Josh Homme’s artistic decisions, even if not quite all of them work. With three nearly perfect albums and three very good to excellent albums, plus Them Crooked Vultures with John Paul Jones and Dave Grohl, this is a seriously classic body of music, rivaled in the mainstream rock universe only by The White Stripes. Mainstream! Who’d have imagined back in 1998 that Homme would be striding the earth with a bona fide rock god from Led Zeppelin, and then having a number one album?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy puzzle games and this one has some good ones.<br />The progression of the level of complexity is fairly good.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I had just finished Neil Gaiman’s latest novel, The Ocean At The End Of The Lane earlier today as I got off the train coming home from work. A couple minutes later I passed by the Music Box Theater and saw that Neil Gaiman was doing a reading a book signing, right there at that very moment. It was sold out so I couldn’t go in, but it’s just as well, as my reaction when I finished was, “that’s it?!” For his first general novel in over eight years since Anansi Boys (2008), I definitely expected more. At 192 pages, it’s slight even next to The Graveyard Book at 320 pages, which was marketed for children. But my disappointment wasn’t that I wished it didn’t end so soon. It’s that I wanted it to end even sooner.<br /><br />One of the things I love about Gaiman’s books is his skill at building fascinating worlds. They may be dark and often terrifying, but they leave you thinking and even dreaming about them long after reading the books, particularly with Neverwhere (1996). While The Ocean does present a potentially interesting world, it falls short, mainly because it’s largely seen through the eyes of a seven year-old boy. Now if this were one of his fantastical fairy tales or children’s books, it might be appropriate. But instead it’s a 50+ year-old man remembering surreal events that happened over the course of just a few days, and deals with some horrifying stuff, from child abuse and infidelity to nightmarish body horrors of monsters burrowing into his body, attempts to extract it and being subsequently terrorized. These feel like they ring true with my murky memories of my own old childhood nightmares. However, given that it’s a seven year-old boy, he is completely and utterly helpless, at the mercy of abusive or non-understanding adults, monsters, and dependent on the help of a trio of multi-generational, immortal women neighbors. So the main character really has no control over his surroundings or fate, and thus there is no sense of adventure, only a feeling of impotent horror of watching events unfold, just like a nightmare.<br /><br />The most intriguing characters remain mostly mysterious and undeveloped. And there’s little reason to consider the boy at all interesting or exceptional, save for one act of bravery. I wish I could say it provides fascinating insights on the nature of memory and how it changes in order to protect your psyche from real horrors in childhood, but I really don’t think it’s all that profound. While I still enjoy Gaiman’s writing and ideas, the unpleasant parts of this one outweighed any redeeming qualities. Gaiman is reportedly working on a sequel to American Gods (2001). Here’s hoping he can revive his epic sense of both wonder and adventure.venture, only a feeling of impotent horror of watching events unfold, just like a nightmare.<br /><br />The most intriguing characters remain mostly mysterious and undeveloped.

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I downloaded on my kindle fire and it plays after I download but if I close it out that's it. It will load to the universal screen then crashes. :(
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|The writers of this show are genius. I can't help but laugh out loud at each episode. Mumble mumble mumble.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A very fun puzzle game, definitely needs more levels as I made it through all of the included levels very quickly.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed in this story.  It was not very interesting to me.personally.  This is just my personal view.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|1 of my new fav cd's, every song is great...flawless. Even people who don't know southern rock should give this cd a listen.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|This is a fascinating subject.  I found it well-written, though, at times, rather repetitive.  I would recommend it highly to my friends.
1439193630|5.0|I'm not into mysteries and horror but I thoroughly appreciated the background of SK's and the advice he gives to writers. He sets a good example in his work ethic, determination, and love of writing.
B0090SI4LU|3.0|She's not afraid to try any role and has been excellent in every role she's played (to date). Some of her movies, at best are C (direct to video, i think). She is the only reason to watch this dvd. She does her own stunts. She can change from one character to another with complete believeability. I predict, in time, with the right supporting cast, and movie, she will be an Oscar winner. It's fun to watch her act out her characters; they're so believable, you get involved in the show. Worth a rental or found in a $5 WalMart bin.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Where has this been for the past 15 years or so? When are these guys touring? The last couple of 'ryche shows I went to, it became more about the show than the music. That's not the Queensryche I grew up with. They may have had some great stage shows through the years (Livecrime, Promised Land, Mindcrime II), but it was always secondary to the music. Geoff Tate got away from that in the later years and as much I love his vocals, I think the band is better off without him. They've gotten back to what was important in the first place, the music. And the new guy sounds a lot like Geoff.  This is the album I've been waiting for since Promised Land.  It gets back to their old sound and is a solid release.  I look forward to the upcoming tour.
B003ES61EE|5.0|I've already reviewed the LensPen elsewhere - the same applies to this model:<br /><br />&#34;I've been using one of these for a couple of years and the other day I couldn't find it, so I ordered another one. The brush is so useful for cleaning delicate items, especially nooks and notches in electronic devices, cameras, scopes, etc. But the squeegee end is just awesome for finishing off a good lens cleaning to remove any last bit of streaks - or just for a quick clean-up by itself. Awesome item.&#34;<br /><br />However, this model has a removable and reversible squeegee end which makes it even more usable and valuable for cleaning the corners of scope reticles, etc. I can't believe they can make this product, package it, ship it and guarantee it for the price. One of the best values I've seen in a looong time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|when you play this game you don't want to go back to the other solatiare game I could play this game all day
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Awesome movie and a must-have for all superhero fans. Lot's of action and emotion as usual. I love this movie!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Regardless of who they are, how many, how long we've known them, and under which circumstances, next to God, family is the most important, enduring, and valuable asset each of us possesses.  This is a heartwarming story of  an extended family whose love knows no bounds!  I thoroughly enjoyed this read and will recommend it with gladness!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|It is an interesting short novel, and as most of Gaiman's works it moves you. However, it is not his best no even compared to his children's novels.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is one of America's best authors-when he wants to be. This time he wants to be. If you can read this book (or listen in my case) and not be totally immersed and involved, you are a unique individual. The 70's carnival-type setting is described spot on. Seldom have I cared  SO MUCH about SO MANY characters in a book. The protaganist, 21 year-old Devin Jones is a young every man, but is, in most ways, wise and proficient beyond his years. Many of his dealings with his young, wheel chair bound friend Mike will create chills and possibly a tear or two.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great read. This is a very short read and a superb summary on Nikola Tesla and the power of imgination and innovation.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It keeps messing up my kindle not to mention it keep shuting the game off by itself I would not reccomend tho app.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I loved the book & don't doubt his experience at all-  but was confused how the writer was able to mix the occult with God. There were vague references to Jesus- I guess.<br /><br />I imagine that his experience with our Father is only beginning. I am very grateful to God that he chose Eben to show His Immense Power, Love, Mercy & Grace.  May Eben continue to be intimate with the Father & read The Bible to increase his spiritual knowledge & closeness.

B003477DVK|5.0|A realistic, heartwarming film for the whole family. It reminded of the movie Sandlot but it wasn't about baseball.  Same kind of learn about life as a kid type movie.<br />I love getting movies from Amazon right in the comfort of my family room.  I don't have to worry about returning it or paying for an extra day if I don't.<br />I use Amazon for my Kindle Fire too!  I can download books, magazines, movies, etc.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Oh my this book series had major ups and downs..from the frustrating characters and the writer using the same words over and over (murmmer, and hiss) I could not take it. But I will tell you I could not put this book down i read all 3 in one week.

B00846REIS|5.0|You don't want to put it down, it keeps you at the edge the whole time.  I thought it was very entertained.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie but definitely not for kids.  Allot of swearing but the plow really is very good and realistic.  Would recommend to adults only
B008JFUPK8|3.0|This movie was an awesome action movie with a great cast from Laurence Fishbourne as Perry White to Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman. Russell Crowe did a great job as Jorell, and the back story of Krypton was also enjoyable. So how with all these great things did I feel the movie missed the mark from being the greatest Superman movie since Christopher Reeve, well here is the list and don't read further if you want to avoid SPOILERS!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I'm doing my list by the worst decisions made in the movie to least important.<br /><br />1. Superman/Clark Kent does not kill. He has a heightened sense of right and wrong, and would have stopped Zod without killing him. Superman is the Boyscout, and would not cross that line. Batman would be more apt kill someone for the greater good, and even he has principle about killing. That last scene in the movie ruined the whole film for me personally.<br /><br />2. The first 20 minutes or so of the film I felt I was watching Batman Begins again. You can defiantly tell Christopher Nolan directed this film since he took the story ideas from Batman begins and brought it directly to Man of Steel. No where in the comics did Clark Kent travel on a fishing ship all rugged trying to find himself. The only thing missing was Liam Neeson making an appearance to mentor him and give him purpose. Oh wait I forgot Russell Crowe filled that void when Clark made his way upon the spaceship.<br /><br />3. I feel Lois Lane was miscast, she did not have the feisty and strong personality of Margot Kidders Lois Lane or Erica Durance from Smallville who I personally feel would have done a much better job in the role. I also feel Tom Welling would have done an awesome job as Clark/Superman since he had done it for 10 years, and basically had the torch handed over to him from Christopher Reeve, but hey what does he know, he was just the only successful actor to portray Superman on the big screen and succeed. I don't want to knock Henry Cavill though he did a great job in the role.<br /><br />4. In the comics Krypton was shown and being more technically advanced, but also a beauty to behold. Krypton in the movie got the technical part right, but made the world a dark and ugly place. This is more an aesthetic opinion than a deal breaker for the film.<br /><br />My bottom line on this film is that if you never read the books you will probably love this movie and as a stand alone sci-fi action film it is a entertaining movie, if you are a purist like myself you will walk away from it, and hope one of these days Dc comics will get it right when it comes to these superhero films and stop Hollywood and their directors from trying to put their own stamp on the movies.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Husband is a freak about the Die Hard movies and this one did not let him down.  Lots of action - would recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its fun and its Better than subway surfers, it has a couple annoying features like the fact that you have to tilt it sometimes. Still in all its a good game.
1878424319|4.0|I like it and it is a good read. A little simple and could be a smaller less expensive book.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|From the moment the film began I was captivated. The cinematography is spectacular with a 3D added bonus (optional)! Crisp, clean and crystal clear, unlike anything I've ever seen on the bigscreen. I mean from the colors to the clothing, the actors, aerial angles, flashing lights and special effects, to the energy and the excitement delivered by the soundtrack and the high speed revving from the roaring engines of the rich were mesmerizing. For me, what this film projected was intensely engaging, ever arousing and fantastical in a sense. So much so that I saw the film in theaters 3 times!<br /><br />Let me just say, the anticipation leading up to Gatsby's onscreen introduction had me overly anxious. As a huge Robert Redford fan, I wasn't sure if Leonardo DiCaprio would measure up, but boy was I wrong ol' sport! Leo became a man in this film. Exit Jack from The Titanic, enter Gatsby, Jay Gatsby... And woo-hoo, the ladies in the theater go wild!! Needless to say, I was done! Stick a fork in me why don't ya!!! LOL! From that second on, I fell deeper and deeper in love with his character, his story and his passion for love in his lifetime. Face it y'all,  I am hooked for life. Granted, there were 2 songs on the soundtrack that were over the top and unnecessary (H to the Izzo 0 Jay-Z and a remake of Beyonce's Crazy In Love), but they come and go so fast that they become tolerable and easy to ignore. Other than that and the fact that Gatsby dies, I have no room for contention. Matter of fact, I can't wait to buy it on DVD.<br /><br />In closing, I know for those who saw the original, the modern day twist to the film threw many for a loop. But given the fact that Baz stayed true to the story, the added flair of the 2013 flavor was far from a bust. If anything, Baz's adaptation introduced a younger audience (who may have otherwise lacked interest in the original) to the F. Scott Fitzgerald literary classic. My 15 year old niece also saw the movie 3 times and not with me. She went with her 16 and 17 year old friends who enjoyed it just as much as she did and that says what? It says Baz did something right!<br /><br />All I ask is that you see the film for yourself, but please watch with an open-mind. If you can't do that then this movie is definitely not for you. Don't watch expecting to see the 1974 Robert and Mia, softly lit, slow and semi-boring version (which don't get me wrong, I liked) 'cause you'll be highly disappointed. Watch, remembering that its 2013, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life and I'm feeling good!
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|It does the job of helping me organize my day as well as ensure I do as much as possible in a given day.

B000055Y0X|5.0|An interesting movie from the early 60's staring Peter Sellers, It's primary message was an anti-war movie (remember, this was made during the Vietnam war), and at the time was considered quite inflammatory. An interesting movie, especially in todays time period.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|A friend recommended this to us.  We absolutely got hooked!!  We love it.  Cant wait for the next season.  Not a show for the young ones though.  Language and nudity.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie. Thought provoking. Dragged in spots. I'm guessing the book is better as is usually the case. But don't worry, it's not a waste of time.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Love the great 80's music, it took me back into time. Love getting the ultraviolet Digital Copy. Love all the features.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I love this movie so much. One of the best love stories I've ever heard. It was beautiful and a treat to watch.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great series for the price. I would recommend it to any science fiction reader. A few spots with too much filler, but overall a good story.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The new version of The Weather Channel App for the Kindle Fire HD has too much pizazz. The old version was simple and easy to use with no ads or annoying achievement bars.<br />Pros:<br />1. The map has 15 different layers to play with. Clouds and radar is accurate and very up-to-date. Road Weather Index is helpful and plus their is live traffic.<br />Cons:<br />1.The annoying achievement's bar that appears every time I open the app or a different page. I have 131 achievement's and don't understand how to redeem my points.<br />2. Every time I check my local weather an annoying pop-up asks for my location. When its on, the Location Based Service on the Kindle Fire HD cannot accurately pinpoint the city I live in. No big deal though.<br />3. The pictures in the background on the \\"Now\\" tab make it hard sometimes to read the current conditions. Simply just touch the temperature and it expands and has more info, easier to read.<br />Not a bad app when it comes to the map layers, however the older version wasn't as flashy as this one. Indeed it is a battery hog. Miss the old app...
B005L38QK2|5.0|So I am a hardcore gamer,  not into mmo, previously has g5 lasermouse bf 2142 edition,  was pretty nice.  So this mouse is a nice mouse, not ergo but eh whatever,  been using it and its great, responsive, etc...  The true test just happened a little bit ago.  My son spilled a full glass of water on this thing.  ruined my M$ keyboard.  Mouse pad is still drenched.  My son kept clicking away playing his game.

B001CISHU4|5.0|Coming off their watershed release in 2006's \\"With Oden On Our Side,\\" the seventh album from Swedish heavyweights Amon Amarth marks less an evolution/change of sound and more like a glorious refinement of said sound, a terrifically memorable and intoxicating melodic death metal stew with strong by Bathory-like Viking metal, doom metal, thrash, and Enslaved-style black metal influences. If anything becomes clear within the first few seconds of the album, it is that age has not mellowed or slowed down one bit, nor have they missed a single beat, despite being fourteen-plus years old. In fact, if anything 2008's very aptly-entitled \\"Twilight Of The Thunder Gods\\" proves that Amon Amarth's sound has actually grown a little bit heavier and more aggressive over the years. And speaking quite frankly, the end result is an effort that rocks like hell.<br /><br />The title song morphs into a blistering deluge of fiery, melodeath-meets-thrash chug and churn riffing, galloping, At The Gates-style beats, thunderous rhythms and brisk, undeniable blast beat drumming. Sure, a few slivers of melody do shine through here and there, mainly thanks to the number's guitar solos (it includes one especially noteworthy, ascending melodic solo near the end), but for the most part, this is a very brutal opener. And it eventually breaks into a slower section, but the song remains still quite heavy throughout, as it features some beastly brutal, skin-crawling death metal vocals that come courtesy of Entombed frontman Lars Goran Petrov. \\"Free Will Sacrifice\\" is a suitably strong follow-up, as it locks into a typical Amon Amarth-esque groove with chugging guitars and stomping drums. The tune is mostly of note for featuring some ultra-evil, growly, and visceral -- if not overly so -- vocals. And tracks three and four are even more brutal. The former, \\"Guardians Of Asgaard,\\" is an especially thunderous number that booms out of your speakers, and features some catchy and brilliantly-placed vocal patterns and choruses that are utilized to maximum effect. And Children Of Bodom axeman (Roope Latvala) drops by, here, too, in order to chip in a terrifically ripping and epic melodic guitar solo, too. And the latter, \\"Where Is Your God?,\\" really lets it rip by pulling out all of the stops and flooring the gas pedal with blistering, pure death-thrash speed. That, said, though, there is just enough melody present, here, to keep it all together and prevent the song from becoming monotonous.<br /><br />A bouncy, energetic drum fill introduces the next song, \\"Varyags Of Miklagaard\\" before it eases into industrial-strength chugging and thumping drums. And from there, it gradually speeds up even more to thrashy territory with some unforgettable vocal hooks and choruses. And some occasional melodic sections, including twin-guitar harmonies and melodic backing vocals, eventually enter the picture, thus allowing the clouds to part a bit. \\"Tattered Banners And Bloody flags\\" serves as the record's first real curveball, as it is a piece of pure, sludgy, murky, and relentlessly dark and depressing doom metal akin to the likes of My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost. And then, following \\"No Fear For The Setting Sun,\\" a death metal-inflected speed-fest with ripping guitar leads and solos, comes \\"The Hero,\\" another doomy cut that evokes vintage Grave, with its crunching guitar hooks and ominously restrained (read: doomy) breakdowns. It also has some creepy, gothic-tinged vocal rasps, and a few classic melodeath-derived harmonic leads in the background, too.<br /><br />The album is then rounded out by a couple of prototypical Amon Amarth epics in \\"Live For The Kill\\" and \\"Embrace Of The Endless Ocean.\\" Both adhere to a patented A.A.-esque gallop with rhythmic rhythms, thudding drums, and chugging riffs. But only \\"Live...\\" can claim to also boast a whipping fast guitar solo, as well as a melodic breakdown where a cameo from symphonic metal band Apocalyptica gets time to shine with its use oforchestral-sounding keyboards and violin arrangements. And \\"Embrace...\\" is another safe-yet-satisfying Amon Amarth tune. The only difference between it and the ones that preceded it is a fantastic, soaring, and infectious guitar melody that carries the song almost majestically.<br /><br />Superb!orchestral-sounding keyboards and violin arrangements. And \\"Embrace...\\" is another safe-yet-satisfying Amon Amarth tune. The only difference between it and the ones that preceded it is a fantastic, soaring, and infectious guitar melody that carries the song almost majestically.<br /><br />Superb!
B000BKHL1K|5.0|Very pleased with this rack . Stylish and modern looking. It blends well in my kitchen among the other stainless steel appliances .
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is quite good and addictive.  The only con is that you have to race through the entire course every time.  Even as you complete stages, every time you race, you start in the beginning.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book! I couldn't stop talking about the story and characters while I was reading it and I've recommended it to all my friends who enjoy reading. This book has substance...depth of development, heartwarming and heart-wrenching story line.
B0035G0U2O|3.0|It is OK if you like disaster movies.  There are some good action sequences but don't expect the move to be very believable.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|However, I found out that this did not go w/my KINDLEFIRE,  I gave it  away!..nowhere did I find how to take pictures w/my KINDLEFIRE....am I over looking it somewhere?
B009WUBERW|5.0|The movie was fun to watch and didn't take itself too seriously.  I liked the first Expendables but this one is much improved.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't get facebook on the Kindle like I get on my laptop.  There's a lot I got to learn yet
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|I have ready every Harry Hole novel that has been translated into English.  I have read them in the order in which they were translated.  So while BAT is the first in the series, it is the last one that I have read.  Had I started with this one, I don't think I would have read another.  It's not nearly so good as the later ones.  In fact, it is significantly worse.  Harry's character is not nearly so well developed as the his Australian aboriginal colleague, Andrew, who serves as his partner.  Worse still, the mystery is much less well planned than the ones we encounter in subsequent novels. Too few clues are given along the way.  Chapters do not flow well.  Key linkages appear absent.  I was not impressed.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|George Martin has written a masterpiece. Mixing magic, fantasy, war, love, intrigue into an unforgettable epic that thrust  storytelling into another dimension altogether.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|When Joss Whedon came on board to helm \\"The Avengers,\\" I knew that this film was not only in good hands, but that something wondrous would come of it.  Having been the creator, writer, director, and producer of some of the best TV shows in recent years (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly), I was familiar enough with his work to know that the story, dialogue, and characterization would all be well done.  Whedon is a master at balancing all of these things, and not allowing special effects to overshadow the story.<br /><br />Marvel did a very smart thing leading up to The Avengers.  Rather than spending time trying to explain the origins and backgrounds of these six characters, this was already taken care of in their subsequent films leading up to this film.  At nearly two and a half hours, the story wouldn't have to suffer distractions of an hour-long origin introduction.  In other words, they could just jump right in!  And, boy, does The Avengers jump right in!<br /><br />This is easily, in my view, the best superhero team film done yet.  The only thing that matches it is the animated TV series, \\"The Justice League.\\"<br /><br />A crisis is threatening the planet.  It is a threat that no one superhero can deal with on his/her own.  And so, Nick Fury the Director of SHIELD (and wonderfully played by Samuel L. Jackson) has arranged to assemble a group of superheroes to deal with the crisis.  However, the question becomes, can these heroes put aside their egos and differences in order to work together?  This is the question that the film spends half of the time dealing with.<br /><br />Loki is the principal villain in this film, and Tom Hiddleston plays him superbly with a type of cunning and pleasure that Loki is renowned for.  He has made a bargain with beings from another dimension, to help him conquer Earth.  He holds the Cosmic Cube (Tesseract Cube), a source of nearly unlimited power.  Loki agrees to give these beings the cube in exchange for help in his conquest.<br /><br />The members of the Avengers do not come together easily.  We are treated to the first great battle of the film.  Iron Man vs. Thor.  The other thing that makes this film so much fun is that in addition to watching the Avengers fight the villains, we also get to see them fight each other!  Anyone who is a fan of superheros, comic books, or both, hold the eternal debate: who is stronger?  Who can beat whom?  Message boards are littered with people arguing about these things.  And while the film doesn't necessarily answer these questions outright (and the comics rarely do either), it is still fun to watch!  Later on, the ante is \\"upped\\" when we get to see the two juggernauts of the team go head-to-head: Thor vs. Hulk.<br /><br />When all differences are put aside, and the members of the Avengers realize that they must work together, then we see what happens through the power of unity.<br /><br />All of the actors fit their roles beautifully.  What can be said of Robert Downey Jr. that hasn't already been said?  Whedon's script gives him a chance to shine even brighter than he has in previous films.  Stark must answer the ultimate question for himself: is he willing to give everything of himself to save humanity?<br /><br />Chris Evans is a good Captain America.  In the comics, Cap is the natural leader of the team, and he's always giving strategical orders to the members.  He commands a presence, that regardless of his lack of real power, is highly respected.  I hope to see more of this quality in the next film.<br /><br />Another standout for me is Scarlett Johannson as the Black Widow.  As the only female member of the team, she has a covert intelligence that is sorely needed on the team.  Johannson plays Natasha with a quiet cunning.<br /><br />The final battle scene, which takes up nearly a full hour of the movie, is a battle of epic proportions.  We see the Avengers fighting an endless sea of Loki's minions in the heart of New York.  The battle is superbly done, and it never detracts or overshadows the story.  The build-up to this point gives the film epic climax.<br /><br />The Avengers is just a ton of fun.  But it is a far more complex and deep film than people may realize.  Whedon never loses sight of the human element, which again, is so characteristic of his other heroes like Buffy and Angel; that it isn't so much what you do, but who you are while you're doing it; that there is a lot more to being a hero than simply fighting the bad guys.<br /><br />This epic film will be a fan favorite for a long time to come, and we can only hope that the second entry will be as good as this one was.  And if you want a sneak-peek at the villain for the next installment, then don't turn the film off during the credits!  Nearly everyone in the theater gasped and cheered when they saw who it was!le is superbly done, and it never detracts or overshadows the story.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will make you think, but not so challenging to make you frustrated.  It took a few tries to get the rhythm of the game, but it was a fun way to pass some time in the airport.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent program, great characters, liked it alot!  I enjoy watching this commercial-free series.  It's so much better than watching it on network TV.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm so surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel.  The characters grew on me and the plot surprised me. I've thought about it several times since I read it.  The characters remained with me.
0143121421|5.0|When John le Carr&eacute;'s published Spy in 1963, the tautly written international bestseller was unusual for its cynical, amoral protagonist--a fictional character much less exceptional fifty years later.  This economically told, plot-based yarn is without doubt one of the finest spy novels ever written, the writing being especially impressive because the author was barely into his thirties.  My caveat is that such a protagonist works better in films than in books because a viewer is less likely to ask why a cynic would risk his life for (in his worldview) nothing much in particular.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I devoured this  book.....could not put it down....Read it in one day. Wish it had been longer. Such a good read.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I really did, but the main character was character free.  The story only worked when he was peripheral to the action.  There was little to no character development and it felt like the short story it was intended to be.  It just was unsatisfying, the first Gaiman book I've EVER felt this way about. It wasn't worth the wait.
B004YLCKEU|4.0|This was a wonderful, nostalgic visit to some of my favorite A-Ha songs. (I saw them in concert on their first visit to America when Hunting High and Low was released.) My only quibble was that, for me, there were way too many closeup shots of Morten's tongue and Pal's whiskers and wrinkles in the first half.  The videographers could have created more flattering shots that wouldn't have been so distracting, unless they were actually trying to show them warts and all. Quibbles aside, this was a good video in which the performances kept getting better during the course of the concert,  and worth watching again.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|I watched the film version of &#34;The Help&#34; within a week of finishing the book. I have to stop doing that. I did the same thing recently with Neil Gaiman's &#34;Stardust&#34; and was disappointed with the movie version. I experienced the same with &#34;The Help&#34; but on a much lesser scale.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the movie. It flowed well, didn't seem too long (even though it was nearly 2.5 hours), and the acting was great. The problem was, it went too fast. It stayed pretty true to the book but there is a lot of character development in the book and I felt the movie missed some of that. As with many things, it probably would have been better as an HBO miniseries.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'll admit that I hadn't read this book until after having seen the movie, having been told by several people that it was very weird.<br />I totally disagree. I found this book to be supremely well-written and loved the main character.<br />A classic!
1401937519|5.0|Really touching book.  Anita's story was riveting and interesting beyond belief.  I am so glad that I chose to read this book.
1451668945|1.0|Generally I enjoy MHC's books, but this one let me down.  It was contrived, predictable, and altogether a big disappointment.  The writing was poor, the story jumped around too much, and was not very interesting.  As you can see, I did not enjoy this book!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's hard to stop playing this game!  Great for passing the time, or for putting off things you really need to do.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started this book and could not put it down. As you read the book, you begin to understand that all these people are living underground and have been for a long, long time. It unfolds a little at a time keeping you engrossed until the end and on to the next book.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|this game definately keeps ya guessing.  the challenge is what keeps ya playing.  I really like this app and hope that there are many levels to come
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is THE BEST fps on the appstore. The controls will take a few missions to get used to, and you can change the layout of the controls if you don`t like the way it is  already set up. Multiplayer has no hackers at all. They are just using the classes and the special skills that the game has to offer. Unlike most other gameloft games, getting the main currency is much easier, so you may not have to buy credits. In the new update, they added a Grenade launcher pistol, a sniper rifle, a new grenade, and countless other bullets, rockets and scopes. They also added the ability to make clans so you can play with your friends om the same team. It takes a lot of download space, but if you love fps games, be sure to get this one. If you have any questions/comments, send them to me. My gameloft username is: NexusPlaysMC.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like Pinterest! Love the recipe boards, especially. Also a great way to share photos with friends,  promote my business, collect decorating ideas, find new ways to deal with health issues and find sewing and craft ideas. Great way to share interests with friends and get to know them better.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If Neil Gaiman wrote a new novel every month I'd buy it and read in one sitting if I could.  The Ocean at the End of the Lane is classic Neil Gaiman - wonderfully constructed story, &#34;old&#34; magic and suspense and of course marvelous characters. Characters you would like to personally encounter (but then you wouldn't remember you had).  I highly recommend this novel.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So masterfully written that I have decided not to see the movie because I know I would be disappointed in it. This book is impossible to put down, it is insanely good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME ever I play minecraft every day I play minecraft I like multi player so I can join games with my friends omg I'm defently sharing this game!
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot's artistry in combining science, research and a true life adventure of her own into a spell-binding book is nearly unrivaled. She has the rare gift of understanding the role of a white professional exploring the life of a Black woman and her family with directness, honesty and respect. She manages to include her own experience of going places she had never been, meeting people from a completely different background and letting their stories shine through. It is a heroic effort, meticulously edited.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by my own editor because of the masterful writing, particularly the weaving of personal experience with telling the stories of others, of another race.  But the story itself is the primary reason to read this book. Anyone who romanticizes medical research or doubts that ongoing racism permeates the institutions of this country will wake up to some harsh realities.  No wonder this remains on the best seller list two years after publication.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|get ready for lots of thrills in this movie I sure hope you like to laugh& lots of fun great job Nicolas Cage

B007ZYK3CE|5.0|with a twist to surprise you!  Its a bit gritty and makes you appreciate your own life.  Great struggles and acting.
B005HED11Y|4.0|I would rate this as one of the top ten Star Trek original series episodes. Word of caution that the &#34;HD&#34; moniker is a bit misleading as it still plays in a standard definition box.
B001NA6096|3.0|I dont know what I was expecting...maybe something with a bit more humor?<br />granted I have seen the previews for all the sequels but these look much more entertaining.  Not a bad film, but not exciting.

B001EOOQEM|5.0|9th studio album by Black Sabbath, who would of thought, they would release this classic after the turmoil they went through in late '78.  \\"Heaven & Hell\\", (1980), brought in Rainbow vocalist Ronnie james Dio (who made me forget about Ozzy) and master producer Martin Birch.  This album starts off with the first single \\"Neon Knights\\",  a classic in the Black Sabbath canon,  just a smokin' track, never gets old.  The crunch of \\"Children Of The Sea\\",  a solid tune, \\"Lady Evil\\", reminds me of Early Rainbow, another Iommi screamer.  \\"Heaven & Hell\\", great 7 minute title track, the band rules on this one, excellent chord progressions.  The blitzing \\"Wishing Well\\", Ronnie James sings his heart out here.  \\"Die Young\\", nice intro, Iommi let's it rip on this track, great pounding rhythm section of Butler and Ward, Dio's vocals are tremendous, metal at it's best.  \\"Walk Away\\", had a feel good sound to it, could i say commercial sounding Black Sabbath, good tune.  \\"Lonely Is The Word\\", maybe the only tune i really never got into when first released, but it has grown on me over the years, Tony plays some groovy guitar here.  I saw them with BOC on the Black And Blue Tour in St. Louis.<br />Geoff Nicholls played some fine keyboards on this album.  \\"Mob Rules\\", would come out in 1981.<br /><br />The band in 1980:<br />Ronnie James Dio  vocals  Born 7-10-42  died  5-16-10<br />Tony Iommi  guitars  2-19-48<br />Geezer Butler  bass  7-17-49  (same as my dog Riley)<br />Bill Ward  drums  5-5-48<br />Geoff Nicholls  keyboards  2-28-48
B003PIUC02|4.0|The show follows the slaves/gladiatiors from training to the arena to fighting for their freedom from the Roman Legions.<br />Very good series from Starz  Roman Empire: war, blood, sex, violence and politics.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Shinedown is one of my favorite bands, because of all their amazing music they have released over the past 8 years.  All their CDs have been amazing with tons of singles released on the radio, and yet I am still not bored hearing that music even after all this time and radio play.  Amaryllis is a wonderful CD with some nice songs like Bully, Unity, Enemies, and the title track Amaryllis as well.  If you have enjoyed other CDs from Shinedown in the past, then it is a good bet you'll enjoy this one as well, but do keep it in mind that Like a Whisper and Amaryllis are a bit different in their overall sound.  As it is seen with many bands, they have different sounding music at different points in their lives, but also, it does tend to happen that with age the band mellows.
B00004RCO9|5.0|What a GREAT Movie..A must have..Funny, an oldie but a goody...Bought this for our Mother to see, she really did not get into the movie that much, maybe she just did not understand it, but it is one of my Sister and Daughter and my all time favorites...Fast shipper too...thanks

B003XVYLDU|4.0|Quirky, insightful, strange, funny...I love Vonnegut's weird style, and this is a classic, but it is not for the average reader.  If you are not familiar with the Allies bombing of Dresden in WWII, you should become aware, but I am not the anti-war dove that Vonnegut is, although I do not blame him after what he went through.
B00023BLXK|3.0|I like Diego Luna, which was my main reason for buying this film, I could not find it on Netflix, etc....... Obviously it isn't comparable to the original....... but has a similar plot. Disc came in good condition, but there was no cover art in the dvd case (blahhhh)

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 delivers! Seasons 1 and 2 did well with defining characters and setting plots and subplots. Season 3 is refreshing and surprising.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Good read but the ending was predictable and a bit smultzy.  And, don't get me wrong, there were some very good things that happened in the 80's but to make someone watch War Games over 100 times?

B004X6PRO6|3.0|Clever, quite inventive, much too overdone and broad, often repetitive but satisfying novel. A couple of extraordinary characters keep the pace flowing. Get past the first few chapters.
0061950726|4.0|Orphan Train is such a great book, historically accurate and written with such vivid imagery that it is more like watching a movie than reading a book. I loved the characters, rich and dynamic. Yes, the story is a sad one but it compels the reader to believe in the power of perseverance.<br /><br />This is a very fast read and one I was wishing didn't end so soon. The only reason I didn't raise it a 5 was because of the abrupt ending.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This story reads like a novel but it is an actual account of a dangerous operation.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|I'm not in the YA category but I enjoyed this series very much.  Like so many others have said, this series was a bit too tame.  The YA category can handle a bit more violence and I think Ms. Meyers let everyone down by not including some head bashing with the Volturi.<br /><br />While I wished the Volturi had been given a larger role in the books AND in the movies, I got really tired of them always being so damn intimidating.  I'd have been pissed as a Cullen if they all traveled with the entire clan across the Atlantic to end my life because of Irina.<br />Yes, the Cullen's are a peaceful bunch, blah blah, but Breaking Dawn was a big let down in the end.  I completely agree with Summit Entertainment for adding a fight scene via Alice's visions.  PERFECT.<br />It took a movie to finally give the audience what they'd been wanting for such a long time.  I'm am so grateful no one had spoiled the ending for me when my daughter and I went to see Breaking Dawn Part 2 in the theater.  We both gasped right along with everyone else as soon as Carlisle's head was torn off his shoulders.  Lol<br /><br />After the movie, I remember thinking, \\"Dang, they needed to do this in the book.\\"  I would have liked to have seen Bella with a bit more humor as well.  Maybe when she's sure she knows she wants Edward to change her she could ponder never having an icy cold vanilla coke again or a chocolate bar.  Maybe ask Edward if you're changed with an extra 20 pounds would you forever be frozen with the unwanted weight for all of eternity?  But, that's rewriting the book too much and I honestly have no desire to write a vampire story myself.<br /><br />I would really love to see the continuation of the series, but not focusing on the Cullens so much.  I think the story should go on to let the readers know what happens to Renesme and Jacob as time goes by. Charlie needs to find out about the Cullens and vampires in general and everyone needs to come together once again to fight the Volturi when they come to end the lives of Charlie and Sue Clearwater (who are a couple by now.)<br />A couple of side stories could include Leah finally imprinting on someone and putting to rest her incessant whining throughout the previous story in the Twilight Saga (very annoying.)<br /><br />Maybe Meyers could kill off Mike or Jessica at the hands of a Volturi (and the Cullens could end that Volturi in return or something to that effect.)  I don't believe the reader is interested in nobody characters like Bree Tanner or any of the other of Victoria and Riley's creations.  The Short Life Of Bree Tanner was a terrible book and not worth the money.  It had been offered free on Meyers website for a time and should have stayed that way.  I was livid when I paid nearly $10 for that small small book.<br /><br />Ms. Meyers could also go in another direction with Aro's wife or maybe Jane could make a huge mistake and is on the run for some reason.  ANYTHING would be more entertaining then Bree Tanner.<br /><br />I gave Breaking Dawn 4 stars because it was the conclusion of the saga and I enjoyed the entire saga very much.  While book four was a letdown in the end, it still somewhat satisfied me as a reader and I do sincerely hope Meyers is secretly writing more of this great story (and make sure you hire help that won't leak it to the internet this time!)when they come to end the lives of Charlie and Sue Clearwater (who are a couple by now.)<br />A couple of side stories could include Leah finally imprinting on someone and putting to rest her incessant whining throughout the previous story in the Twilight Saga (very annoying.)<br /><br />Maybe Meyers could kill off Mike or Jessica at the hands of a Volturi (and the Cullens could end that Volturi in return or something to that effect.)

0061148512|4.0|As someone with a minor in English and a penchant for writing, I am thoroughly ashamed of the fact that I have never read The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath. Obviously, I have learned quite a bit about Plath and her bouts with depression and suicide attempts [and eventually successful suicide] and her poetry. Hauntingly beautiful poetry about the saddest feelings a human being can experience. I honestly assumed that The Bell Jar was a memoir, a non-fiction account of her own demons, but this is Plath's one and only novel, fiction.<br /><br />The novel follows Esther Greenwood's decent from normality into a deep depression, much like Sylvia Plath herself. It sounds like an entirely too melancholy novel, but it really wasn't. Esther is calm in her dismissal of the joyous happenstances of life and there is something admirable in her distaste for the small lives most people live. It's not the way I feel about life, but is still an interesting portrayal.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app has recently changed and I absolutely hate it.  the screen is so filled with junk I can't even see the weather. I don't want this point stuff or whatever it is to keep popping up.  You can't get rid of anything or make changes in the settings.  If you can I sure haven't found it yet.  I have uninstalled it and will not be using you app again.  Way too much trouble and unfriendly to use. Too bad because it used to be a fairly decent app.
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is the quintessential nerd novel for our generation! Wade Watts is a typical nerdy kid in 2044's technology obsessed world, where everyone lives the majority of their life in The Oasis; a virtual reality lifestyle for all. When the creator of The Oasis dies of old age without an heir, he leaves his company up for grabs for any game-obsessed \\"Easter Egg\\" hunter [aka: gunter] who can pass the three hidden gates successfully!<br /><br />Without giving away the plot, I'd just like to say that Wade Watts ROCKS! He's such a great hero-character to this video-game-and-80's-trivia novel. I loved trying to guess the clues to the hidden gates and attempting to guess the plot. Cline kept me guessing until the end.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED this novel! Are you a nerd? READ THIS BOOK! Just saying. It was incredible. Definitely a top 5 in my own novel list!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]

0486275590|5.0|Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is my father's favorite novel from childhood. I have never really taken a grand interest in it and even tried to start it at one point in college, but never got farther than a chapter in. What a mistake it would have been had I assumed I knew the story and avoided reading it myself!<br /><br />You think you know the story of Treasure Island, but if you have not read it yet, you know nothing.<br /><br />The novel is about young Jim Hawkins and his run-in with an assortment of pirates, leading up to his discovery of treasure island. I think my favorite character is Long John Silver... the captain of the mutineers! Silver's treachery and switching of loyalties is far beyond entertaining... and the way Stevenson writes his characters really draws you in. What incredible storytelling!<br /><br />Treasure Island has definitely made it to my favorite books list! Worth checking out, even if you are a 20-something year old working in cube world. ESPECIALLY if you are a 20-something year old working in cube world!<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
0452298482|4.0|this book puts a lot into perspective. Nothing shockingly new - but the stories from the people are very great.
0393327345|3.0|Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk was my high school boyfriend's favorite novel, but I felt meh about the movie. Too judgemental about the fact that you didn't realize Tyler and the narrator are one and the same.<br /><br />Knowing the twist, I did not know what to expect from the novel. I found it to be more of a story of one man's delusions and how quickly others came to admire and follow such a lost soul. The fight club is almost a sort of cult with this deluded man at the center of the group. There are some pretty classic lines from this novel and I found myself enjoying the novel more than the movie.<br /><br />Chuck Palahniuk definitely has a style, though I'm still unsure as to how I feel about it. I'd give the novel 3 out of 5 stars... I liked it, but I'm still undecided as to whether I would suggest it. Still glad I've read it finally.<br /><br />-Sarah<br />[...]
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love Temple Run, and when they came out with Temple Run 2, I loved it more!  But then they updated it with some new obstacles, which are great, but now the game is very glitchy.  My character dies much more often because it did not register my command.  I would also love to see further improvements to the different levels and challenges.  Getting to level 8 is really fun.  I like collecting coins to be able to buy upgrades and other characters.  But once you reach level 8 and have gotten all of the upgrades, the game then becomes boring.  There is no longer a reason to collect the gems and coins, and without a \\"goal,\\" the game gets boring.  Then you have only one goal left before you can reach level 9, and that is just collecting \\"meters run.\\"  A person can reasonably achieve level 8 in about a month (or even a week if you really just play the game a lot!)  But then it would take several months to run enough meters to reach level 9.<br /><br />So I would love to see more interesting goals and challenges, or things to buy with the coins and gems.<br /><br />I play this game on my iphone4.  I suppose the review is a bit unfair, because when my kids play on their Kindle Fires, the game is not glitchy.  And technically, this review should be for the Android devices.  But there you go.

I don't subscribe to Showtime, so I have to wait for the dvd.  I have to agree with other reviewers regarding the promos on the dvd.  You are forced to watch the promos for at least two minutes and you're not allow to skip ahead.  Other than that, it's a great addition to any dvd collection.  I look forward to purchasing Dexter: Season Eight the final season.

B00CX7OX6U|5.0|There is a reason every single critically acclaimed and independent director cites Malick as an inspiration. You just have to be intelligent to watch his movies. Sadly, a lot of people that watch his films and then comment on things like this are of the unintelligent collection. 'To The Wonder' is a masterpiece. A visual symphony of emotion that is realistic in every possible way. 5/5.

034580709X|4.0|By now most readers of crime fiction know the somewhat odd release schedule of this series.  But just in case....Jo Nesbo, author of the Harry Hole series, writes in Norwegian, hence the need for English translations.  Which don't often get financed by publishers until the author has a favorable track record.  Nesbo's third book, The Redbreast was the first to be translated into English and published in the UK and the US.  The Bat is the first in the series, only recently translated, and first published in English between the release of books 9 and 10.  Book #2, Cockroaches, is scheduled for release in the US Oct 15, 2013, and the newest Harry Hole, #10 The Police, will be out December 10, 2013.<br /><br />This is a series that relies heavily on events in previous books, so finally having The Bat available is a bit of a blessing and a curse. A blessing because there have been many references made to events in this book which have been confusing and are now clear, and a curse because eager fans like myself will read three Harry books in five months with very different time periods.  For example, The Bat was written in the late 90's.  Cell phone technology was still very new for most users and not all features we enjoy today were available then.  So there is considerable description of how cell technology works and how a caller's location can be tracked by getting data from 2-3 towers, etc. Then another passage where a called party id's his caller, not by caller ID which apparently wasn't available then but rather through some amateurish analysis of background noise.  Felt like a 1939 movie for a moment there.<br /><br />\\"The Bat\\" takes place in Australia, where Harry has been sent to observe, or is he being punished, or is he expected to assist?  Anyway, Harry behaves for the first 50% of the book except for one rather silly bar room brawl.  But then we finally see the real Harry, the bad boy Harry, and the book begins to get interesting.  There's a gorgeous redhead, and there's an old flame that Harry ruminates about, and a critical point in the ending where the two somehow get mixed up in Harry's mind and confuses him - and me.  Enough that I had to go back and read the passage twice more.  There is a good twist and there are two especially tense scenes describing a carnival beheading act.  Also, the location for the climax was an interesting choice, and the ending was two thumbs up. So as usual, mostly strong positives from Nesbo.  But there are a few so-so matters as well.  I have no doubt that had I read this book first in the series, I would have rated it much higher than 4 stars (and I think 4 is generous).  But after 7 Nesbo books which have steadily gotten better, I have high expectations, and this fell short.  The writing is good, but that first half was just too slow. I thought the choice of bait in the climax was totally unrealistic as was the short shrift paid to a recently discovered victim.  Finally, I have read negative comments about the translation of this book; I found it to be acceptable with very few distracting phrases and expressions.and there's an old flame that Harry ruminates about, and a critical point in the ending where the two somehow get mixed up in Harry's mind and confuses him - and me.

0470913029|5.0|This is a well-rounded book that provides a good synopsis of the Paleo diet.  You don't have to be an evolutionist to understand (or agree with) the concepts, although that school of thought will obviously be referenced.  Basically, high-quality fats, proteins, vegetables, and fruits are the basis of a strong Paleo diet.  It's not the most inclusive book I've ever read on Paleo (that would probably be &#34;It Starts With Food,&#34; which just gets into basic principles of eating REAL food), but it's certainly a good one to start with.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was terrific, as were his previous two.  He's a beautiful writer, his descriptive style flows flawlessly.  I was somewhat confused on and off throughout the book with the changing sequences, back and forth chronologies and dozens of characters that the reader needs to keep pace with.  The period spans about a century covering several families.  Fortunately, it does all come together two or three chapters before the end and it's then that I realized how much I enjoyed the read.

B00819ER0Q|4.0|The Truman Show is a sustained critique of a wide range of cultural concepts and values from the 90's. The artificiality of the reality show. The commercialization of art, the commodification of everything we see on the screen. The advertisement 'placements'. The diminishing value of privacy and its corollary: the increased value of exploitation.<br /><br />Carey's portrayal of Truman is phenomenal in its depth and breadth of feeling.  The movie is quite funny and engaging most of the time. And when it pushes its themes to their extreme in order to show the audience what the consequences of these cultural behaviors are, we find ourselves shocked, distressed, and not a little disoriented.<br /><br />Its to the film's credit that it is both entertaining and makes you think.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|I've tried 3D block games before, but this one just didn't work.  The controls were rough and it was hard to tell where the blocks were going to land.  I didn't get clear game rules, either.  On the second level it even seemed like some of game board disappeared!  Nice Idea, though.
B009FRS9CA|4.0|Just got this today Awesome figure its everything you want in a 6 inch Batman figure. This Batman figure puts movie masters to shame. That being said As mentioned in another review the limbs on this figure could be a little tighter especially for the asking price. That aside as a true fan I recommend getting this figure you will not be disappointed. In addition the figure fits great on the bat-pod:D
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Hi. Whenever I use this app at night it crashes every time I view a video. However, this app works well during the morning and afternoon. I don't have time to view it in the afternoon but I can view it in the morning. This is a wonderful app but it should be fixed about the crashes and no-video-views. This, final worss, it's a wonderful app to get because it's free :D You have to just make sure you take care of whatever mobile device you are using so it doesn't crash as well as it did for me. Still good to purchase though!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Written from the point of view of a grieving parent. Loved the thought provoking message \\"what would I do in that situation\\". Really enjoyed this read!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is an awesome game for all ages. I love how it's challenging and you have to use your brain more. This game is not for people who get too confused or agitated by all the steps you have to do. Awesome game :D, good to buy.
0307895475|4.0|Tons of information...to point of overload. But, thats great.<br />I only use it to get me past points where I am absolutely stuck. For that it's magnificent. Not a complete walk-through, but enough detail to get me through. It has helped me out on a number of quests.<br /><br />I do have one complaint. The print is so small, it is tiny. On more than one occasion, I've had to get out a magnifying glass to read it.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is a good app. It crashed a lot for me before but that's because I had too much videos and photos running. All you have to do is go to \\"Help\\" then \\"Camera will not start\\" then read the instructions. It will delete all your photos and videos .. :D I am using a Kindle Fire HD 7 so I can't access the camera on Photos on my menu screen since it doesn't have a tiny camera on the top-right corner. If your videos aren't working on your HD Camera I suggest you delete some photos, then you can delete whatever videos you think are useless by watching them. I bet there's a lot of useless photos or videos on there you will treasure but ..delete some because you will want to add more anyway. I really hope this review helped. :D Also if you want to get a real camera buy one or use your computer camera or your DS camera or other devices that have camera attachments. I swear all of those are better than the camera on here. I understand that this is a good camera to take photos or videos of you and your honey or relatives but sooner or later you will delete this app because you have realized how useless this app is unless you want some s***ty app. I am not saying this app is s***ty even though I just said that it's s***ty, it could be useful in many ways if you don't have any other devices except this one you are using right now. Oh, and the time you delete this app, you can send the photos and videos over to your FB or YouTube accounts. Also I am 13, add me on the PS3 to play CoD.
157421327X|4.0|It was helpful to me and to my grand daughters as a way to understand and get started.  It was a surprise at the outcome of our attempts.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good game to kill time. It could be challenging as well as it is fun to play. It requires good aim (which I ain't good at) and it requires the ability to tolerate the multiple, never ending squawking of angry birds who got their eggs stolen from their junk by green-bacterial looking pigs. Of course, you can turn off the sound in the menu on the left bottom button to mute the sounds so you can just chill and own pigs and kill their masters. :D GG.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A true story that tops a work of fiction.  The many &#34;coincidences&#34; and later meetings are icing on the cake.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I loved - loved living in Tudor England.  We doled out the episodes one by one like fine wine.  I loved the attention to detail, costumes and history that was presented.  I would like them to dive into each wife more and not go through the end so quickly.  More, more, more, more!!!  Showtime - hear me!!!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Can't say enough about this album. It's on repeat! Best album I've downloaded in a long time. I definitely recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books are very well written I just wish that there were more of them! I enjoyed being able to buy all three together it saved some money.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|We enjoyed The Fountainhead very much and the actors were superb! The movie's theme is applicable today as it pertains to how our Political Correctness in society has \\"gone crazy\\" to the point that it is ridiculous.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This series sounds like it was written by a 15 year old girl that thinks she is writing about sexy erotic things. Really the lead character has Daddy issues and it is completely disgusting that we are teaching our young girls that this sort of relationship is acceptable. I really wish Amazon would refund my money I am all about fantasies and encourage people to read but this is total garbage.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This works awesome with my iPhone and I am able to print coupons from my phone now. Was easy to use and setup! The best ePrinting app out there.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This was such a page turner, extremely interesting! Keeps you going until the end. I love the Reacher Series. Twists and turns and intrigue.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, made me realize how hard it is to run a big league team. Go read this today.
0385334206|3.0|Dwayne Hoover is a business man who happens to be losing his mind. Kilgore Trout is a struggling science fiction writer who ends up winning the Nobel Prize. On his way to the Midland City arts festival, Kilgore encounters Dwayne in the cocktail lounge of a Holiday Inn. After being introduced to Kilgore's work, Dwayne believes that the message within Kilgore's book is one directed toward him personally and he completely comes undone. A lot happens, but after injuring dozens of people and biting off Kilgore's finger,  Dwayne ends up in a mental hospital.<br /><br />Clearly, I missed the message with this one and I am always searching for a message when I read. But this one was just way, way out there. Too much for my over-addled brain to compute at the time. If I rated this one on entertainment factor alone, I'd rate it pretty highly but what was with all the penis talk? Penis size is apparently a big deal to Vonnegut as it was mentioned often. Say, every few pages or at least it felt like it. For me though, entertainment factor alone wasn't enough.<br /><br />That said, this would be a great book for a book club to pick apart. I've talked to some other readers and they all say that this is not his best work. I'll definitely read something else by him, but this one I can't recommend unless you want to experience an acid trip without actually dropping acid.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching all 3 seasons since I got Amazon prime. I love it!! So bummed though  that Season 4 doesn't start until January 2014.<br />Great series and so fascinating.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I would give it a 5 but every I use this app on my kindle fire it ends up force closing every other pin I open :( Works great on my s3 though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very nice app very accurate. Love the, radar feature and hourly reports. Very nice when I need to quickly get an accurate and reliable forecast
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addicting and keeps you thinking. Try to figure out which clues to use where to get more clues and get out of the room.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I loaded this to my Android, clicked to open it to play (does NOT EVEN open) and it force closes every time.  Uninstalled and re-installed- same response.  Too bad because I love minions!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|The author showed a lot of compassion and explained the sadness of  living in Afganistan.  It sure endured me through the whole book
B00992CF6W|3.0|i played it with my friend, we both said survivalcraft is better. and i want notch back in mojang!!! AND DONT CALL IT A COPY BECAUSE MINECRAFT COPIED SOME GAMES TOO!!!
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Just OK.  Couldn't find a theme, a plot or a story line to be exceptionally pleased about.  Cute characters, but they couldn't carry what was a less than compelling movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evermore extensively. Keeping information from other locations is easy. Folders are easy to set up and use. More than enough space is available for home use. I would recommend Evermore to everyone. I also like the synchronization between all my computer and tablet.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I no longer miss Google reader. I enjoy card display and speed of updates. It is simple to set up and edit as you try out feeds.
0670921912|4.0|This could go on your bookshelf near Tim Ferris' _4 Hour Work Week_, but perhaps with more frequent referrals and pulling from shelf.<br /><br />I find great value in author's inclusion of maintaining life and good family ties, even with new baby, while pursuing and achieving at least 6 skill-acquisitions over 1 calendar year - while keeping &#34;day job&#34; too.<br /><br />While the idea of nearly-instant acquisition of a new skill is dismissed by Kaufman, early in book, as still being a Sci-Fi fantasy, it could be great material for Kaufman to produce another book on eideditc-memory training and Photo-Reading, as well as the new neuroscience backing up the rapid and accelerated learning possible by bypassing much of the conscious mind with use of shifting one's brain waves and brain-state - including hypnosis, NLP, and meditation.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Amy, we miss you. What a great singer. I love this album. Both of her albums were great. A +
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Is it a page turner? Yes but not in the desperate- to-finish, up all night sort of way.<br /><br />Did I want to read it while I wasn't reading it? Not always.<br /><br />Did I think about it while I wasn't reading it?  Yes.<br /><br />Did I learn something while reading it? I think so.  Without any real knowledge of Asperger's Syndrome, I have to assume the writer has done his research and this is a fair representation of someone with Asperger's (although whether Don Tillman has Asperger's Syndrome or not is only implied and never actually confirmed.  On page 19 however there is a helpful quote by Julie which says, \\"Most adults with Asperger's Syndrome don't know they have it.\\")<br /><br />Many reviewers call this a laugh out loud book and I never once laughed out loud.  Nor did I fall in love with Don Tillman as also suggested by several reviewers. To be honest, I don't know that if Don Tillman were in my life, I'd actually like having him around.  But I did find him very interesting and enjoyed Rosie's character and his relationship with Gene and Claudia.<br /><br />This is a very good book - it is very clever, quirky, skillfully written, well thought out and researched (at least I assume so!).  It is also a wonderfully original idea, so totally different from any other book I have read of late and as such, I would have to say it's a real breath of fresh air!  It is also a love story written from a male perspective by a male writer, which is not the norm these days.  I think the author really put his head and heart into the book and I appreciate his effort.<br /><br />When I rate books, I also like to take into consideration cost because I do feel you need to take this into account.  Having recently taken advantage of self-published books on Amazon which are offered for free or under $10, I find myself getting really really picky about the books I pay for.  I didn't used to be this way, I just accepted the standard price for a book and if it was bad, I simply let it go.  But now that the price of books are no longer uniform, I find myself analyzing value for money and this does impact on my perception of a book.  Especially in light of my recent full price best-seller purchases by established authors which had me totally disappointed and rendered me almost resentful!  If you are going to publish a book and charge full price, it better be good... dare I say it but no taking the piss out on your readers - no resting on your laurels anymore!!!<br /><br />I paid $20 CAD for The Rosie Project and this is an acceptable amount to me as it did provide several hours of entertainment and amusement - I came away feeling totally satisfied - even if I did not laugh out loud!it go.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really fun  I Love it so much it's amazing it could use better graphics though it's awsome
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I didn't find it scary. But good book. Kinda was wanting a more twisted ending. Would b good movie though
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like the seasons before, this one does not disappoint. My only complaint is that we have to wait so long for the next season!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I rented this at the suggestion of a friend and found an instant draw into the imagination and storytelling of Miyazaki. Spirited away is my first and still my favorite of his films.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|As with my regular computer, I don't always check out YouTube, but I do like it when I do.  I have been able to bring up obscure songs and scenes from movies.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next book!! I was awesome i have to read it all over again. The only issue was the ending!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I used to play this, and still do, on my laptop.  I like the fact that I can take it with me wherever I go.  My laptop is kind of heavy, compared to the Kindle, and I don't always take it along with me.  This works out perfectly.
B009R89CRI|5.0|Diary of A Wimpy Kid: Roderick Rules is a book that I liked because it is funny and accurately describes how kids and teenagers feel about younger brothers, and how nice they are to their relatives when that's the last thing they feel like doing. It is easy to read with comic strip pictures that bring the story to life. A great book for kids who are tired of reading boring homework and want to read a little bit of fun instead. David Carter-Brown (10yrs)
B002LL167W|3.0|I am very unhappy with the purchase of the Proposal.  You ordered it to be sent from The United Kingdom which is not in the Region of watching in the United States. It would cost me almost as much to return the movie to them as it cost to buy it so I have a movie that I paid $11.20 for that is &#34;WORTHLESS&#34; to me or anyone else in the United States that doesn't have special equipment on their DVD Player to watch (out of Region) movies.  Are you required to replace this movie to me from a company in the United States?<br /><br />Please respond with an answer<br />Thank you
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This whole series is fabulous.  Highly recommend to anyone who want to fall in love with the characters and root for a winner!
B00005JLIU|5.0|Whether on Broadway or on the silver screen, Julie Andrews is a class act.  The first movie I saw in a theater was &#34;Sound of Music&#34; and I fell in love with Julie and the story.  &#34;Thoroughly Modern Millie&#34; is another vehicle to display the talents of this top quality actress, singer and dancer.  I am still in love with Julie (my wife knew about this and was totally OK with it, at least I think she was!) and cannot think of any production in which she was less than stellar, unless it was &#34;S O B&#34; which I feel she was pressured into a lower quality script by her producer-husband.  &#34;Millie&#34; is far from that kind of material.  Carol Channing and Mary Tyler Moore complete the high quality cast leaders.
B000KOZMUE|5.0|The flash is very easy to use and does not look out of place when I use it. I would recommend to others.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's fun to play and has great graphics. Easy to understand for most ages too. I don't usually play these type of games, but I am really enjoying this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book jumps back and forth by chapter and when you read it on a Kindle it can be confusing.  Definitely recommend reading this on a BOOK so that you can easily refer back and forth in it.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|My husband is a big Eagles fan so for his birthday I ordered this.  It was a much appreciated birthday gift.  He's watched it several times and loves it.  A big hit.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great collection. You can take Rocky 5 and use it for skeet practice but all the others are classic. Very pleased with purchase
B000MZHW4A|1.0|No sound was coming out for the movie. I put in my dvd player I could not hear anything. That is strange. Money wasted.
0345308239|5.0|Every book by Tuchman is worth reading. This one is excellent. Very well researched. If only history didn't repeat itself - sigh.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I played this game on my freinds I phone and I fell in love with it!!!!!! Get it its worth it
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book...divided in to a number of separate distinct sections and covering a lot of ground regarding space travel, relationships, archeology, genetics, technology, population growth, religion, human condition and also measurement.<br /><br />I'd finished all the Fire and Ice series and was desperate for some thing else from Mr Martin while I wait for the next book - this fit the bill nicely.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Ahh Stephen King!  Don't stop at any rest area, head to a truck stop instead or maybe a restaurant!  But who knows what lurks there.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|Love the actors/acting; little too much &#34;romance&#34;....liked it better without; storyline is getting a bit strange with too many twists and turns.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Like many others, this app no longer works on my kindle fire HD. The game is quite  fun but I've experienced screen delay issues since the first time I've played. Overall a fun game but its numerous drawbacks, bugs and eventual crash, have shown that this app deserves its 2 star rating.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|I need protect $2K lens front and back. Must have it. perfect size and fit right at the back side
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Overall I was pleased with the app.  The only thing I found repetitive was the constant going back and forth between areas.  I fell this could have been assisted with a fast travel option.  The elevator was particularly annoying as it kept stopping on every floor.  Most of the puzzles were interesting challenges each unique.  The inventory box was also a little cumbersome to use.  All in all it is a really well crafted game worth getting with replay value.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Although a good writer, there are some problems with his characters. His main characters have no sense of morality. They are perfectly comfortable, whether married or unmarried, jumping into bed with whomever. The subtle philosophy presented by the author is that man is barely above the animal kingdom. There is no understanding of a compelling need of commitment (which, unfortunately places women in a vulnerable position). With so many excellent, well-written books, there is no need to read another from this author.
B00571F26Y|5.0|IT WORKS FOR ME AND IT WAS GREAT, HE IS A GOOD WRITER. ITS AMAZING WHAT DOING WITHOUT WHITE FLOUR WILL DO.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|More then worth the money.<br />Sealed deck so cool.<br />Wish it had draft only thing that could make it better.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I am not a cat person, but I find them interesting. There is much debate as to their intelligence, but I suspect that &#34;intelligence&#34; is a matter of individual interpretation. If one likes them, their antics are seen as cute, sweet, and understandable. If one doesn't like them, they are thought to be dumb, arrogant and defiant. This book, seen from the cat's viewpoint, covers all the possibilities. It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and invokes sympathy (or pity) for those who have cats in the family. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but was not swayed towards a state of cat ownership) either owning a cat or being owned by one).
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|when I clicked on social it said my best score was only 9 when it actually was more than 100,000 and after 2 days when I clicked on it it loaded for a few seconds then kept bringing me to the home menu.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is better than anything that is currently on TV.  I wish they made more series like this.  This is a classic!
B0043D2L9S|1.0|Its painful to wear and I found that just running a single strap from any of the lowepro accessorys that go on your belt works better because you can detach them faster and they accomplish the weight distribution better.infact any nylon strap with a metal clasp on each end would work better<br /><br />It doesn't come with instructions.<br /><br />It looks unattractive and unprofessional.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I chose 4 stars because this man is so believable in his journey.  He explains his journey scientifically and yet he explains his journey with feeling for the average person. Compelling!!!0
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Amazing band, have have this cd on repeat since I bought it. Digital copy sounds great. Can't wait for the next release. This band has an old country soul with a southern rock attitude.
0307592731|1.0|Most of the book club disliked the choices of the author.  we thought she showed incredible stupidity in her choices.
B00BUWY74M|5.0|I get to think that Joe Friel's books are complementary.<br />This one is definitely a good option for a &#34;one stop&#34; reference book.<br />It will make me race faster, of that I can me sure :D
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it the buildings are great<br />This is the best game ever  totally cool super duper cool a million
B0089LOKHG|4.0|This series was hard to NOT put down, Lauren does such a great job to keep you wondering. I do have to say that the first 2 books were better then this 3rd book. The ending left you wondering without any idea if she'll actually round it out for all the readers! Everything is left open! What happens to Hanna? Who does Lena choose, Julian or Alex? What happened to Tack with what happened to Raven? Either way weak ending and slightly pissed!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was ask around pretty good. Kept you clinging to your chair, never knowing what v was about to happen. Always threw you a curve ball!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game but it's very unresponsive! My KF freezes especially when it is charging! This is so annoying!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Why I like the book?<br />great book, reads well, entertaining, gives lots of food for thought, short, relationships, self assessment, geography of England, fun to read, very interesting
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|Bought this album when it was on sale for $5.  Glad I didn't pay more.  Though I like the album overall, on a few songs he sounds a bit too much like Dave Matthews Band (he could honestly fill in for their lead singer if they ever needed him.)  And while I don't mind Dave Matthews, he's not at the top of my favorites list for sure.  I was hoping the album would sound a lot like the singles released (Home and Gone, Gone, Gone.)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love playing on this game!! It has great graphics!  But it took FOREVER to load on my kindle fire. Other than that I liked playing this app! I hope you like the app!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I already saw the movie but I did not know that they would make a game. well they always make games about movies.
B000KIPT30|4.0|I returned it for that reason.  I bought it thinking it would have usb power and it did not.  It does what it says and would be good for a land based use.  Not so much for portability
1490313370|4.0|When James wrote 'Choose Yourself' he showed up and shared his learning with generosity. I can well imagine James writing in a swoosh-style as the thoughts and sentiment flooded his being - he doesn't use carefully calibrated words - he get's it down...and puts it out there and then he watches to see what will happen... he is, in my opinion, a man who sincerely wants to save people a trip down the road of frustration and apathy. I am an entrepreneur and have been for 30+ years and James provided me with a some excellent examples of how the world has changed, and how these days are ideal, absolutely perfect for launching our abilities using social media combined with confidence and a recipe for maintaining confidence and balance. Thank you James. I'm sure James does not care if you like his writing or agree with his thoughts/ideas... James knows to BEWARE OF RESISTANCE. Nora www.duo.ca
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you're into solitaire then definitely get this. There are some ads every now and then but they're not nearly as annoying as others. The graffics are exceptional and there's even a hint button in case you get stuck. AND IT'S FEEE!
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|this was actually a good movie better than i thought i only rented it because my father wanted to watch it and it was actually good.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I got this game yesterday and loved it but now it will not open. I have tried installing again and even rebooting my kindle to no avail. I would have given 5 stars if it actually worked :(
B00COHIFQS|5.0|started watching the movie with my kids but it was to scary for them.  This movie is very good even the ending was sad but good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so wonderful,  especially for horse lover's. I certainly recommend it to anyone all ages! I love it!
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|loved the movie full of action and a good story and beautiful women.  I love that era they way they dressed and talked.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The acting in this particular production is fantastic.  Romola Garai is outstanding as Jane Austen's Emma...her facial expression tell the story even better then the script does.  All the characters are wonderfully done in this account.  I watched each episode in one day...I couldn't wait to see the next and I already know this story well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|When I am bored it keeps me busy. Pretty cool game. I like the challenge it gives me and my kids.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I am a great fan of ninja kiwi, and love bloons td, so when I found it on the Appstore, i had to have it. GET IT NOW!
0140557741|5.0|I purchased this book to use for a team building exercise.  It worked beautifully for this purpose and everyone enjoyed looking through the entire book at the end.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Love this one, I am gluten intolerant and this book has helped to open my eyes. I have emjoyed the recipes too.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Allot of action like the first movie. Loved the cameos that pop up unexpected. It's your typical shoot and blow everything up guy movie. I would probably watch it again.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Been watching the series on TV ever since season 2, and I never got to watch the fist season or the pilot - where it all started from.<br />Dean and Sam, from the start of season one, were the perfect choice for two actors to be brought together. They're character chemistry for two brothers shown even in the first season.<br />Whoever thought up the scripts too, for the first season episodes was great for introducing an audience smooth into then possibly a controversy and touchy subject matter. Great box set. A got to own or Load to your Amazon account (Cloud) and watch later when the mood hits you.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|This is my most favorite album by Lady Antebellum.  I listen to it all the time driving to work and home.  Relaxing and soothing choice of songs.  I never tire of listening to this list of songs.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I really love this game but I'm waiting a lot of time for the update 1.7, please when will it arrive for kindle.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|I almost didn't download this free app of the day because of all the negative reviews. But I'm glad I did! It's challenging but not impossible. I played it for nearly four hours tonight and only played two rounds - not the instant loss some others have talked about and I did not find it at all frustrating as it was for some other reviewers. Granted, I played on Easy level but I did enjoy it very much. Going forward, I believe I will enjoy the challenge of playing at harder levels and trying to beat my own high scores.<br /><br />After playing a few times, changing my rating from a 5 to a 4. I still enjoy the game and think it's fun. But I wish you could save a game and come back later, and an undo button and high score tracking would be nice.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|This movie did not really come close to the other die hards. Bruce Willis part seemed to be much weaker as they tried to include his adult children.... I just didn't think this script was strong enough to even compare to the previous die hards.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I ordered and got my DVD much faster than the order had stated and it was in excellent condition.  I am very happy with the order and would highly recommend the place to anyone.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is not usually the genre of book I read,  but I love this series! I'm on the 4th book and am starting to feel anxious that there's only one more left...and it seems that there's many years before the 6th book will be out. At least I have the TV series to look fwd to watching ;) This is a must-read!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is awesome.... it's always right and very dependable. I love that the news forecast that I watch uses it as well. Now I don't always have to worry about what the weather will be each day.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I would not recommend this to any friend, wish I didn't even have to click a star.  Sum it up her stalker is killed, she gets married and she frees him by her finger up his behind - what a waste of paper for book lovers and a waste of money for kindle readers
0812993845|5.0|If you like reading for fun and need a few laughs, this is the book. I enjoyed it a lot and passed it on.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Not many apps are as straight forward as this!  All my MP3s in one spot and sorted by album, artist and song.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. It's a lot like temple run, but so much better. You not only have to worry about obstacles, but also moving trains. I will admit I want to punch my kindle at times from running into things when I swear I pushed over. But this game is definitely worth the download. :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is excellent! It is an easy, entertaining read. Thank you John Grisham for helping me escape reality for a little while.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a really fun app but when I play it will take me back to the home screen of my kindle!!!!
B000053GTF|5.0|For me this DVD is very special as my daughter and I were fortunate enough to attend Celine's concert in Milwaukee on March 19, 1999.  Let me say I have been to many concerts, but this one had a special aura and we came out of there feeling as if we were on a cloud.  This brings back many wonderful memories as my daughter passed in 2004, so it has a meaningful place in my heart.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves Celine Dion.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I don't know how I missed this in 2003, but I am glad that I purchased it.  I also purchased a CD of the music.  A terrific movie in my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Well when I got it  it worked then every time I clicked on it it would not would not work

B001BC5HXG|5.0|The characters in this novel are so deftly drawn that they keep the reader glued to each page. I adored the history in this book as well and was sorry when it ended. On to Grapes of Wrath!
B009R659L8|4.0|I always love Mary Higgins Clark novels, what can I say? liked this one, but maybe it had too many characters to keep track of.. ,
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Its is an easy read. Very interesting story. Very bloody! It explains things a lot more clearer than the movie obviously. A lot better than the movie!
B000FBJF3M|4.0|I am going to Pompeii in two months.  This historical novel provided insight to life in Pompeii before Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD.
147674355X|5.0|This book completely suprised me...I couldnt put it down- literally I read the book in four hours!!! It consumes you and you visualize and feel every emotion that happens as the story unfolds. Its like a movie that plays out and every turn surprises you as the story is told. The characters have so much depth and passion that you wont want to put it down!! This is a must read!! WELL DONE Colleen Hoover...I will be looking for all of your books now!!

B00514HDNW|5.0|This was my first time &#34;reading&#34; this book. The audio was well-dramatized. Actually it was a little creepy which was in keeping with the contents of the book. :-)
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Gave as gift to a older lady,she loved it and said she watches it at least four times a week.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has phenomenal graphics and it gives you endless missions and can keep your children occupied for hours, though that I won't allow. Great fun.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|My son played this game on an all-in-one at Best Buy and 45 minutes later I was able to pull him away from it. Came home and got it for the Kindle and now the Kindle is more than mine! I like to watch him figure out these &#34;physics puzzles&#34;.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|acing is superb, as is the story and the music is not bad either. Nicholson's best performance of his career. an adult movie - they do not make them like this anymore.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This tale is simply a classic. I fell asleep every night to the audio narration. I love this story and its one of my favorites in my kindle collection.
0553386794|5.0|Having seen the entirety of the HBO series (everything up to the end of season three), I went into \\"A Game of Thrones\\" knowing that the experience was going to be a bit diluted. Half the fun of the series is grinding your teeth into molecules in anticipation of what happens next. If, like me, you've seen the TV show and are interested in picking up the source material, this review is for you.<br /><br />In the dynastic country of Westeros, trouble brews when the Hand of the King, Jon Aryn, dies under mysterious circumstances. Without going into too much detail (seriously, even those who are passingly familiar with the series could give a better summary than this), this leads to a power struggle for the Iron Throne of Westeros. \\"A Game of Thrones\\", the first in Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, mainly deals with the prelude to the war that dominates the rest of the series. Focusing more on political intrigue and conspiracies than battle and fairies, the saga manages to make the hurdle into adult fiction without going out of its way to be edgy.<br /><br />Like I said, this review is for people who are at least passingly familiar with the TV series. If that's the case, this is what you need to know before picking up \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"<br /><br />1) Yes, do it. It's totally worth it.<br /><br />2) While the series is forced to tell its story within 10 episodes (or, roughly, 10 hours), Martin has a much space as he damn well likes, and he uses it effectively. That said, he does occasionally fall into the age-old fantasy traps, like when he describes every single rock and stone of a castle that's ultimately not all that important or, even worse, casts so many characters that you need a Hitchhikers' Guide to Westeros to keep track of them all. These ultimately extraneous details give the world a level of depth that's difficult not to admire.<br /><br />3) All the characters are much younger than in the HBO series. For example, the show portrays Robb Stark as an 18 year old (and, to make things worse, casts a 26 year old to play him); however, the book states (over and over again) that Robb is only fifteen. Oh, and Dany is 13. While this may seem like a small detail, it can make certain parts of the book uncomfortable for the squeamish (Dany and Sansa's stories have some particularly brutal momenents) and may shy away some readers. And if you take issue with the blatant sexuality portrayed in the series, then steer clear of the books. It's one thing to watch naked whores bounce around on the television screen; its quite another to read long paragraphs describing intense sexual acts, many of which involve at least one minor. It's uncomfortable, something Martin probably intended, but you can't help but feel like you should be on some kind of watch list every time one these scenes comes up.<br /><br />That all said, there is no reason (or, to put it bluntly, no excuse) not to pick up \\"A Game of Thrones.\\" With all the hubbub surrounding the show, the books, the merchandise (Tyrion: Talking Adventure Doll, by Mattel), it's easy to forget what a gigantic feat Martin has achieved here. His Song of Ice and Fire series is emotional, intricate, and compulsively readable; as someone who knew what was going to happen, I still found myself reading late into the night like a madman.<br /><br />So take a break from torrenting the show and go pick up a copy. Or better yet, buy the box set. Nine months is too long to wait for season four, anyway.year old (and, to make things worse, casts a 26 year old to play him); however, the book states (over and over again) that Robb is only fifteen.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|Having dropped out of VHF programming back in the 90's I've not missed the increasingly maudlin, soporific pablum the networks were shilling out to consumers. The 11 minute blocks of Drama/Comedy/Suspense wedged between horrific time-sucks from repetitive, brain-eating sponsor commercials. That said, with the popularity of Netflix and Amazon streaming, commercial free libraries I've been able to pick and choose what interests me and, for how long.<br />Having found J.J.Abrams work with earlier series (Alcatraz, Firefly) I was a bit leary of starting another potentially engrossing show only to find it end to abruptly. Still not through the 3rd season but, as of this writing I can predict I'll be both bummed when I reach the final episode and, excited by the prospect of re-watching this compelling ensemble work their way through the dozens of uniquely crafted storylines that weave past (and through) this dual time-spatial drama.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Though this is supposed to be a product rating and not a movie review, I wanted to comment on Matthew's review titled \\"Old Sport.\\" as a separate review because commenting on his post would merit less views, and I don't like misconceptions.<br /><br />So yeah, rap probably wasn't the music Fitzgerald had in mind for Jay Gatsby's parties, but that doesn't mean that kids in school studying the novel this movie is based on won't find this movie helpful. In fact, it might be more helpful than any movie adaptation made before it, for this reason: it is largely contemporary. I think it sticks to the story quite well. It is only told differently - that is, it doesn't attempt to stiffly adhere to some notion of antiquity. It tells the story in a way people today, and probably especially those the adolescent age of students studying the book in school, will understand. Maybe jazz in the 20's evoked a feeling different from what it evokes now. And so the soundtrack used in the film expresses what the novel means (while still playing along with the Jazz Age theme, entertainingly) - lavish, badass partying, scandalous forbidden love, intense hope, for example - and isn't that what's important?<br /><br />I think watching this movie will enhance the understanding of anyone who reads the novel.<br /><br />Otherwise, whether you are studying the novel, reading it for pleasure, or not reading it at all, this is a great movie worth watching. Superb acting, gorgeous costumes for each body that appears, music that makes an impact, and brilliant retelling of a timeless story.<br />Gorgeous.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Starts off kinda slow but once you get to the second chapter it starts getting interesting. I couldn't put it down
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game....it's very realistic and I'm totally addicted.  I can't wait to be able to purchase more horses.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I have heard such wonderful things of this book from my friends. I had such high expectations, but I think I was ignorant to what this book really was. I love the odd realistic view on the world Charlie had. It's refreshing to get that type of perspective. But in ways I got a little bored..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is one of the best books I ever read because it is written so well and every time I finished a chapter I just wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next. Catching Fire is #1
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Great book. Just like the paper one to buy in stores.<br />:D Okie carry on folks. Seriously leave. Like really, leave.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This deal was wonderfully priced.  Although I dont like all the movies it was definitely worth it. Bought it for the Hubs more, but both of us will enjoy it.
B00008438V|5.0|All there is to say is one good old movie to watch. My kids liked it as will. I love to show them movie that was good when I was their age.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a good read...however, I wish this would have been the last book of this series.  Hoping these series don't<br />go on forever.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is very cute! I gave it full stars. The graffics are well done and not to mention cute. This game is very very addicting, I have found myself playing for hours. If you want something to pass the time and is fun I would recommend this game! Hey it is free, it never hurts to try it, right!

B000I3SYEI|5.0|A movie based on an outstanding villain from the TV series, one of the best Star Trek movies. A must for all Trekies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun and adductive. I wish there were more levels because I went through the ten very quickly.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Hands down this is worth every penny of the $0.99 I paid for it.  the skins are great and it uses the entire display.  Beautiful colors and it doesn't lock my 1st gen kindle fire!!!!! I actually use it vice my phone or another clock to wake me up in the morning!!!  I highly recommend this to everyone that can read this review... I promise you won't be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman has  a superlative talent for thinking like a child and portraying a child's mental processes.  I thought the &#34;Graveyard Book&#34; was the &#34;gold standard&#34;, but this book exceeds that mark.  I was unable to put it down until I was finished.  Did I understand the book? I don't know, but I felt like a little kid the whole time that I was reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun game and all,but the next day it wont let me play...please fix..I enjoy this game but not anymore!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the first two seasons...the 3rd season is outstanding! Watch it over again each year. Looking forward to Season 4.

B006RXSW5O|1.0|well, it was in black and white, so it must be good?  Funny?  Yes if your idea of funny is watching an old man watch a cat pooping in its litter box. watched about half and was OD'd at that point.  I shudder to think what all the derivative flicks are like.  Surely you have better things to do...like having your nails pulled, or being impaled.
B004EFN6K8|5.0|an enjoyable concert. Diana talks about her twin boys and how they enjoyed the holiday. Diana is a consumate performer.
0812550706|5.0|This was a book that made me lose a bit of sleep. Orson gets us into the head of Ender. I enjoyed the pacing of it and the concept of using the kids was clever. Note: this predates Hunger Games by at least two score. Some look on it as some neat high-tech battles, but we are seeing a pattern of stories where it really is all political. When you get to the end, it is like, \\"Are you kidding me?\\"<br /><br />I liked it as it was and have been hesitant to read the following books in the series, but my friends tell me they are just as good, so I will go for it.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Thought it was a cowboy flick and almost turned it off--glad we didn't.  True Surf story...excellent, we really enjoyed it.
0312427646|5.0|This book is used, but looks new.  It was recommended by a friend, but I have not read it yet.  Think I will love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i love this app it make me wake up to see the sun shine in the morning in the morning
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun and engaging game. Lovely graphics and creepy background noises are a great bonus for this make-you-think game. Definitely too short, I could have happily played this for many more hours! Make another one (or three)!!!
0375842209|5.0|My book-group chose this title for our last read and we all enjoyed it.  We thought the book was sweetly told, a bit of a mystery and narrated from a perspective that was not usual for a World War II setting. . . . . . .we each chose our favorite character and enjoyed sharing meaningful passages.  The Reading Group Questions at the end also helped shape our discussion.  Recommend it!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|This was a pretty good book.  My interest was captured right away and really never wavered throughout.  The characters were interesting and I was pleasantly surprised with the slight twists and turns.  Would recommend.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works just like it is advertised.  Very Helpful. It is always great to know how much battery life is left for viewing movies or listening to music.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Son and I played for about a day and loved it. Until we tried opening it today and it just keeps closing. Goes through the first 3 screens..wont allow you to get to gameplay anymore. Needs updated.

B005I548B4|5.0|This was a tear jerker. I loved it and couldn't put it down. I didn't want the story to end.
0385344333|2.0|I'm a fan of Jack Reacher.  Enough of a fan that I can't bring myself to watch Tom Cruise use his stardom to try to inhabit a Jack Reacher whose very bulk is key to his character.  But Lee Child's \\"A Wanted Man\\" betrayed his own creation of the character of Jack Reacher far more than Tom Cruise's lack of physical stature could possibly do.  The thing is that, in addition to his bulk, Jack Reacher is a cerebral guy who takes huge risks, but always in a manner that is rational. And there is little that makes rational sense in this novel.  I became a fan because I loved the concept of the hero who has been rejected by the system precisely because he believes in doing right more than following orders to the letter, who could be a bully but isn't, who doesn't even get involved unless it is to protect another who is being bullied and then doesn't hesitate to make selfless choices, even against heavy - but not non-sensical odds, and whose very choice of life style is consistently an object lesson that speaks to the over commercialization of our society.  The problem with this novel is that the author, Lee Child, just doesn't seem up to meeting the standards of his previous novels or of the character he has created.  In one scene Jack has to figure out a convoluted code that depends on an instant ability to remember how far along in the alphabet every letter is from every other letter and then figuring out that if a hostage seen through a rear view mirror is blinking her eyes and moving her head to one side or another it means the eye blinks are referring to either the position of a letter in the alphabet or how far to the right or left of a particular letter in the alphabet one should go to get to the letter that is really intended. Then Jack and the hostage are able to have a conversation, even involving relative trivia, where the hostage reads his lips and he reads the convoluted alphabet soup delivered by eye blinks and head shakes seen through the rearview mirror whilehe is driving a car.  What?  You've got to be kidding me!  But that's not the worst part.  The worst part comes at the end of the book when Reacher makes the decision to gamble not just his life but also the lives of two people he doesn't really know in order to try a highly improbable rescue of a third person he doesn't really know by attempting to assault  an armed camp about which he knows nothing.  The whole situation cries out, \\"If you do this the odds in any real world scenario would be virtually 100% that all of you will die\\" as over against, \\"if you wait till a marine swat team arrives a few hours from now the odds are almost as good that the person you're going to try to rescue will be as dead then as if you try to rescue him now and get one or all of you killed.\\"  Without totally spoiling a really poorly conceived ending to this book it isn't possible to explain how many things are wrong with the whole scenario right up to the very last disappointing comments.
