B0085Z8F4A|2.0|You know, it's a shame that no one thought to use an android who sabotages the mission for the company's agenda way back in 1979, because that would have been a killer plot twist. I'm being sarcastic, duh.
0452295548|5.0|What an amazing must read book. I learned so much about strokes and recovering.  The list of 40 things that need to be addressed to someone healing from a stroke and also questions to ask the doctor are mind blowing.  I hope other people who have strokes in the future have a recovery like Ms.Taylor's. To come through the years of recovery with a joy filled attitude, learning to disconnect unwelcome memory loops that serve no useful purpose to yourself. All I can really say is READ IT!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie on New Years Day. Great actors set in the mid-60s with fun and quirky twists and turns. Big thumbs up from both of us!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Some funny bits are interspersed with a contrived plot line that meanders about in an uneven performance by Mark Whalberg.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|To be honest, I didn't like this book more than the last straw and cabin fever. It just wasn't that exciting!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I choose this rating cause the movie had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. I have recommended it to all my friends.
0399160450|5.0|Clancy is back to his old form - many plots and subplots.  The story is crafted masterfully.  It's a good read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a cute book, but it went too quickly in my opinion. The characters weren't a  developed as I would have liked.  The whole novel felt rushed and the ending was not surprising.  There should have been more character development.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|As compelling as it is fast paced!  As always, no shortage of forensic information mixed with intrigue.<br />The story line twisted enough to keep one guessing without losing direction or the interest of the reader.<br />The characters remain true from their original inception, while still developing as they age.<br />Another homerun for Dr. Scarpetta and gang!
B009NCM248|5.0|This album is everything I expected from Stone Sour.  The whole album is amazing from the beginning to the end.  I have never skipped one song on the whole album when listening to it.  The highlight of the album for me is The Travelers (Pt. 1).  It is a pretty amazing song.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this album.  Looking forward to House of Gold & Bones Part 2 in 2013.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great book, and one of the best post-apocalyptic novels I have read.<br /><br />However, I never would have given this book a shot if not for the accessible pricing.  So I am doing the rare deed of leaving a review per Mr. Howey's request in hopes that this sort of direct publishing effort is something that continues to gain traction and been seen as a reasonable alternative.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great thing to do when stuck with parents at work. Also anytime you don't have anything to do it is fun.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Great! Good reading. Fun for all. A story for young and not so young. Share with all your friends today!
0060254920|5.0|I am a volunteer one-to-one reader at a preschool, children ages 3-5.  Boys especially like this book and, given the opportunity to choose from 5 or 6 books, most likely this is the one they want to read... again and again!!  I've just purchased this now as a Christmas present  for my 4-yr-old great nephew.  You can't go wrong in giving this as a gift!<br /><br />This purchase was a \\"new\\" hardcover book, but I was a bit annoyed that the outer paper bookcover had to be taped in the area around the spine where the paper folds were starting to split.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I love the movie, but giving this 1 star since the digital copy is ultra violet only and doesn't work on iTunes. I hate it that they try to force this UV on us when iTunes works far nicer (out of all these online movie stores the only one that still works is iTunes - the rest keep folding - disney's store being the latest example - but at least they gave you an itunes copy as well so it doesn't affect me).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone said this book didn't live up to the first two... but I thought it was just as good if not better.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I think this is a fun game and I play it a lot though I wish your energy would load faster.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you understand yourself to be quiet, this book will help you.  If you believe that everyone should pretend to be extroverted, this book will help you correct your thinking.  If you've never wanted to be quiet and never understood people who are quiet, you must read this book or continue to be baffled by how the other half lives.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|should have known better to just buy it amazing game love the match 3 game and building fish tanks another great playrix game
B005HSGB6W|4.0|A Clockwork Orange was a very interesting read at times the made up language was hard to follow, but once I figured out what they were talking about it became a quick read. Beware of the graphic scenes of violence in the book they are needed to get the point of the story accross.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I love every song!! Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are genius! Can't wait for their next one. I recommend buying this!
0307895475|5.0|My son's eyes were huge with excitement over the size and thoroughness of this book.  An MTG player will expect detail and this does not disappoint.  I do not know how updated it is, but my son is very current and he was very happy with this book.  He will have to carry it though - it is enormous!
B0011Z32KI|5.0|Downloaded the MP3 songs for my wife because she is a big fan. The songs play clearly on the stereo or the computer speakers and she is happy with them.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|As I sit and listent to this wonderfully amazing soundtrack I can visualize the movie again!  I love it!  Sound is good, emotion comes right through the recordings and grabs you!  I definitely recommend this soundtrack to everyone so we can &#34;be at the movies&#34; when we can't &#34;be at the movies&#34; through this awesome music!
B002RB7VMA|5.0|Downloaded the MP3 songs for my wife because she is a big fan. The songs play clearly on the stereo or the computer speakers and she is happy with them.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Enjoyed this book so much I have been recommending it to my friends and people i know are animal lovers.  I so believe my golden thinks like the dog in this book so cleverly written with a heart tugging story as well.
B003B02PFO|5.0|I loved this book.  I laughed out loud on the bus while reading it, and many other people around me said they loved the book, too.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I bought this combo for my husband for Christmas. He loved it he said the picture quality and sound were outstanding.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|I watched the 1st 4 seasons on Netflix and when the new season started I ordered the first episode. It didn't grab me in the way I had expected it to so I will be waiting for it to become available on Netflix rather than paying for each episode.
B005VGUA5S|5.0|This album is an excellent addition to my Pink Martini collection, but also makes a great gift to someone who may be unfamiliar with the talents of this group.  Thomas Lauderdale on Piano is amazing as always.
B002VX0A40|5.0|My daughter is 5 months old and we got her this for Christmas. She loves the bright colours, the crinkly wings and the mirror on the end of the tail. There are also multiple things for chewing on when she's teething and different textures for her to explore.<br />Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming, and she wants something simpler, but I love everything Lamaze produces. We got Dee Dee the Dragon because our girl was born in the Year of the Dragon. She also got Emily the little girl doll from an aunt.
B008YI91HS|4.0|Good quality.  Not the best but it's still enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend it if you don't want to buy the DVD/Blu-ray.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I now have all of these CD's and listen to them in my car and at work all day!!  FANTASTIC BUY!!
030758836X|2.0|It seemed too choppy...too simple...so easy to predict outcome! I found it mildly entertaining for those not used to complex scenarios.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I now have all of these CD's and listen to them in my car and at work all day!!  FANTASTIC BUY!!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I have a three year old daughter who loves Gary. She is autistic and often forms \\"abnormal\\" attachments to certain objects. When McDonald's had Spongebob toys, she got a tiny, very easy to lose Gary that we would all have to search the world over for. I once even paid someone five dollars for theirs. Lol. Eventually, they were lost for good.<br />This Christmas I happened to find this online. Unknown to me, so did my mother and father. My father also bought a back up. She LOVES this toy. And, thank goodness we have our back ups. It was a lifesaver and definitely worth the money. (:<br />It's a beanie baby, so it can tear, but doesn't tear easily. Another plus.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If you're a Family Guy and/or Seth MacFarlane fan, this movie is for you.  This movie was as funny as I'd hoped it would be, even after seeing some good parts in the trailer.
160788657X|5.0|The author writes very well.  This series is ery interesting and keeps you wanting more.  I would strongly recommend this book
B0000062FL|5.0|I bought this album on LP when it first came out about a million years ago.  It's a real pleasure to have it again on CD.  Thank you Santana!
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|Nevosoft dropped the ball on this one!  They have some great ones out there but this isn't one of them.  This is supposed to be an academy of magic but they made all of the professors blubbering idiots!  The story line is stupid and the graphics aren't very good.  The whole game consists of talk, talk, talk and more talk.  Then you find the same thing over and over again in different rooms.  But wait, it doesn't stop there, then they talk and talk and talk some more!  Don't waste your money or time!
0143119680|1.0|If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have even given a second glance to this book. I wish my current self could go back in time and slap my past self across the face for even starting this wretched lame excuse of a book!<br /><br />If I could rate this book zero stars, I would! Though I won't go on in detail about how awful the book's plot is, since others have already and consistently have, I'll just start by saying how on earth anyone would rate this book 5 stars!?! It felt like work, it was literally an effort just to muster the will to pick up the book and start reading, because I hate not finishing a book no matter how bad it is. I have to see it through. So, with that in mind, when I FINALLY finished it (after skimming most of the pages because it just rambled on about worthless information), it was a relief knowing that I didn't care there were other books in the series and I had no interest in seeing how they unfolded or concluded (if they ever do!).<br /><br />So, please take my and countless other's advice in the 1-star category: Do. Not. Even. Think. About. Reading. This. Book!!!! Can't say the we didn't warn you.
0525952926|5.0|I looked forward to reading this ever since I finished the first of the triology; I even read the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich to prepare myself. I definitely was not disappointed!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is only the 2nd puzzle game I've ever downloaded from Amazon for my Kindle Fire. I am not quite thru it as of yet but it is very addictive and kept me up for most of the night during the New Year. I am enjoying the storyline and having to meet each of the objectives. The only quibble I have with the game is that it does take up so much time having to traipse from one locations clear over to another location in another part of the town to obtain maybe 1 or 2 clue elements. The map was very helpful though in instructing when a 'action' is required in a particular location and I did find myself pressing the 'Hint' feature on more than one occassion (to keep any despair at not completing a puzzle away). Am hoping to take a shot at more games like this from Big Fish in the future.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Rotate, crop, enhance... everything in one EASY to use ap. I have experienced no crashes or glitches and would highly recommend it.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|One of my all time favorite shows and this CD compilation fits the perfecto rating.  A bit pricey but worth it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|so easy to use between laptop, cell phone and tablet. definitely recommend this to help with lists or anything you need to remember.
B001EBULU8|4.0|I've always loved this movie. However, it is a shame that even after purchasing, then downloading for 4 hours, that Amazon Video has to buffer every other second.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I am surprised at how much I enjoy this album. I first heard some of the album songs while browsing Xbox Music. Lana Del Rey was a featured artist at the time. I was intrigued by her voice; I think her singing voice is one that listeners would either really be drawn to or not care for at all. Personally, I found all the songs on the album to be interesting because of the content and her style of singing. I was fortunate and bought this when it was on sale for $0.99! After listening to the entire album (8 songs) a few times, I wouldn't hesitate buying it at full price if I had to do it all over again.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|Haven't seen the movie.  Heard it was great.  Gave it away as a Christmas gift.  This is a great gift for someone who is hard to shop for.  It is supposed to be funny and heart-warming.  Considering ordering one for me to watch!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Extremely Satisfied with my purchase and at how fast everything arrived.I would definitely by from this person again. A+ all around,
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Haven't seen the movie..heard it was great.  Bought it for my daughter and she loves it.  This is a good gift for a guy or girl.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Extremely Satisfied with my purchase and at how fast everything arrived.I would definitely by from this person again. A+ all around,
0756688701|5.0|This volume provides insight and background stories for the majority of the characters in the Disney Pixar Cars universe. The kids love it as it introduces them to a wider backstory and allows them a greater depth to play from.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Extremely Satisfied with my purchase and at how fast everything arrived.I would definitely by from this person again. A+ all around,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I very rarely write reviews at all, much less gush praise, but this amazing collection from a hitherto unknown author deserves some promotion. My understanding is that this was self-published, but you'd never guess it from the quality of the writing and storytelling. Very well-paced, excellent character development, and well-conceived (though dark) plot and setting.  Although fans of \\"hard\\" science fiction will love it, in my opinion the writing is so good that it should appeal to a broad audience - I'm reminded of Margaret Atwood in this regard.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this Harry Potter DVD series for my kids for Christmas this year.  All went well with the purchase.  I rec'd the item on schedule.  The kids are now enjoying the series.  No complaints of problems with discs and  I hope there won't be any.  Price wise it was ok.  I couldn't find anything cheaper in cost.  Perhaps I didn't search hard enough.  Anyways, we are enjoying the product.
1469984202|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  I will definately be looking for more work by Hugh Howey.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In the vein of matrix, this dystopian future tells the story of what happens when elitist humans are the machine. Yet, by the end, I was left wondering if characters like Bernard, evil and corrupt, were just doing what they knew to make the best of a situation they were thrown into without choice: the better to preserve the human race until the world could be rebuilt. Classic question of whether the ends justify the means. However, I could never agree with how it began in the first place. Too vague? Read it and find out for yourself if you agree. You won't want to put it down.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Another great read from Michael Connelly. This is a quick and engaging read. I enjoy it when Bosch and Haller join forces.
B005544TRQ|1.0|this is another item that i did not purchase. Would like to know why this is coming up for me to rate?
B000TLMWMY|5.0|The DVD exceeded our expecatations and is a wonderful purchase that will be watched over and over again.  We will probably put it on when we have company and parties.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was so funny. A movie not for kids though. Kept me laughing the whole time I was watching. A must see.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's funny and can put you in a good mood. I always watch it when I'm sick.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It is the classic timeless scenario of drunken party night in Vegas that ends in wedded bliss. I loved the story line as well as the emotion she put behind it. I would be excited to see what happened next
0857860801|5.0|Gave this to my brother who loves Simon's Cat. He describes it as AWESOME! This book is great for all the Simon's Cat lovers out there and I'm sure they'll enjoy seeing Simon's Cat's world in color.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Definitely a must have. Guessing the popularity of this CD to grow. Recommend to all. Fitzpleasure was the first song I heard that grabbed my attention and love the rest of CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am normally not into futuristic tales or science fiction, but this book pulled me in immediately and I loved every minute of it. I have also never read a series before without losing interest, but with this one, I read all the books in the series and can't wait for the next one to come out. A must read!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is awesome because the animals can actually move around!! And in other zoo games usaully the animals can`t move!! And you get to find animals!!:)
1596912863|4.0|I promise you - I promise you - that this the last Jane Austen/Pride and Prejudice spin off for at least six months. At least.<br /><br />But Austenland is much different from any other P&P spin off that I've read before. There is no Lizzy/Darcy re-tellings and re-imaginings, and no weird time travel that spits the main character back into Regency England. Instead, as the synopsis stated, Jane Hayes is sent on a holiday in which she role plays a Regency lady for three weeks to attempt to cure herself from her Darcyitis (I'm coining that term right now - to suffer from impossibly high standards because of Fitzwilliam Darcy)... which so many of us suffer from. I don't know how many times I've forced my poor boyfriend to watch the 2005 Pride and Prejudice (starring Keira Knightley and Matthew McFayden - my favorite Darcy, hands down) in hopes that some of the Darcyness will rub off on him. Has it worked? Nope, not at all... but he's more of a Bingley if I'm being honest with myself.<br /><br />Austenland doesn't take itself seriously, either. Jane Hayes, while hopelessly lost as far as her love life goes, is a funny and modern woman. She realizes how ridiculous the situation in which she finds herself is and attempts to make the best of it. This book literally had me laughing out loud at certain points and that has not happened in a very long time.<br /><br />As per usual, there was a love triangle/twist of Darcy-Wickham proportions that kept me on the edge of my seat that was made even more interesting because of the setting of the novel. Because Jane is staying at resort that boasts an authentic Regency experience, every person that she comes in contact with is a paid actor (save for the other guests). Jane finds herself falling for two men but cannot decide whether or not they are acting or if their feelings are genuine. It messed with my mind and the ending completely blind sided me. With the history that I've had with predictable books, it was refreshing to be truly surprised at an ending.<br /><br />All in all, Austenland was a lot of fun. If you are looking for something along the lines of P&P but aren't quite ready to delve into the world of Abigail Reynolds, I strongly suggest that you pick this book up (I believe the Kindle version is currently on sale for $1.99!) - it gave me just enough of the feel of P&P while maintaining its independence. And, if IMDB isn't lying to me, we can expect a movie adaptation in the near future. I freaking hope so!<br /><br />* This book was read in 2012... so it will not be used for any of my challenges.ly surprised at an ending.<br /><br />All in all, Austenland was a lot of fun.

B001JIDE3M|4.0|Good movie. We saw Journey 2 1st so I was afraid this one wouldn't be enjoyed enough. I was along we all enjoyed it. Kept us on our toes
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This was nothing but profanity and stupidity. So gross as to be not funny at all. Unbelievable that people watch this and rate it okay.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is great game for children it develops analytical skills and is fun. Plus it is also an excellent way to destress for adults.
B009HELT3C|3.0|So much has gone into MIB1 and 2 It seemed it lack the luster and creativity of the previous films.  Boring at times even...
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. I have previously read the Percy Jackson series and loved it!! I had resisted reading this series thinking I would be disappointed, but it was extremely phenomenal. I hope Rick Riordan writes many more books in the future.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|the premise of the movie is based on mythology and well executed. If you liked 300, you're going to love this movie<br />Get it
B002UM5BXW|5.0|My wife is a chef, it gave me great insight into what she does and goes through every day she works.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This came extremely fast and Amazon was so helpful in helping me identify the correct cable for an old Kindle.  The old cable's insulation starting cracking and falling off.
0452289963|2.0|Shipped as stated the price was great. Me myself I did not like the book, but that's a personal option
1419705849|5.0|My son loves the wimpy kid series of books and couldn't wait to get this one.  Fast read, entertaining....a change from video games.
B004P4S4NM|1.0|I've been trying to cancel this but with no success.  Please cancel this.  Thank you.  I wanted the CD to play in my car.  I would like to exchange it for the CD.  I didn't realize I was clicking the download.  Please correct this.  I haven't downloaded it.  Thanks.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|Hard to follow and confusing. The descriptive portions poorly written with excess use of adjectives. But the worst part was the extreme use of a thesaurus to insert numerous 14 &15 letter words ( I guess to make the author look smarter than he is) and the frequent insertion of French phrases to be pretentious.....
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Well made, true to the era, acting amazing.  Villains soften, the privileged show their class when prevailed upon to assist in the war effort.  Can't wait for Season 3, expecting the mail soon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing, I could not put it down. It makes you smile and tears at your heart. Recommend it!
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|This is a great album. Love her voice. Not quite as good as the breakout album, but like listening to this one as well.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Alt-J has a very unique sound / style - and is just so different than anything else.  One of the first albums i've listened to straight through over and over in quite some time.
B00AQM85YK|1.0|After I flipped past the cover, I found myself in the middle.  I wasn't sure until I reached the second chapter, \\"Chapter V.\\"<br />Maybe someone didn't proof this before posting?  I found another version of the book and it stated with a title page as I expected.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is just such a different type of game, i heartily enjoyed the couple hours it lasted.  Make sure you have your PS3 online before you play - the unintentional multiplayer part of the game is one of the best parts.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast paced and keep you wanting more. A very good, interesting book from a great author.  A real page turner
B0001VV1GK|5.0|Our grandson (19 months) is thrilled.<br />It's very sturdy as he sprawls on the to drive the cars inside..<br />Matchbox cars are the perfect size, too.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun to try and beat your old score.  Like the different games you can play with Jewel<br />Star.  Always a good game to come back to often.
B00000JMQE|4.0|Interesting mix of Oz books to come up with this movie, but a great movie if you are an Oz fan. The beginning makes me think they were on acid and listening to Pink Floyd when they wrote the movie beginning...shocking.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another fast paced, interesting book from John Grisham.  Keeps you guessing right up to the last page.  A real winner.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|Overall a great little watch for the Lego fans. Only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because I thought the picture doesnt represent the finished product completely...it only comes with as it only comes with a few black and white links, and a bunch of other links(blue, red, green). Also, cant remove the dial to install the logo dial. Still, a good watch for $25
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really enjoy the variety. cant beat this with it being free whatever you may find not to your liking is easily overlooked.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This app is amazing I love it it is like a puzzle app because your looking for objects in different rooms I highly recommend this app.
B009JBZH54|2.0|There are two discs of The dark night and the Batman Raises one  is missing. They should check the product before sending it.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Great songs just about all. The band has a signature sound that comes through in just about every track.<br />That's all there is to it!
B008K8U13K|3.0|Started playing and it was ok until I tried to jump on a ledge. Graphics are good in my opinion but the controls make the game hard to play.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good picture with some deeper lessons and meanings.  Better than previous Batman movies-some representation for good and evil also.  I enjoyed waqtching, very entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I cannot imagine not having this app. It is a wonderful tools to use in reading the Bible and keeping your place.  I have completed reading the Bible in a year for the second time yesterday!  Praising God that I succeeded ....could not have done it without this app.  Keep up the good work.
B003NVN1C2|4.0|The Road - Followed book; good about dediction father to child.  Also raised thoughts about what if.  Acting by VM great.

0446580848|5.0|John Corey, smart ass and crafty, at the top if his game!  It doesn't get better than DeMille on the hunt
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the Batman movies that C. Nolan has made.  It's just too bad he said he wouldn't be doing another one.  I'm not sure if anyone else is going to top what he has done with the Batman movies.
068987149X|5.0|I have a one year old daughter and I like to read Eric Carle's books for her. She loves it, as usual.
0756666937|5.0|A very interesting and engaging book which renewed my son's interest in Legos. Legos are a very simple and hole some activity that allow for free-form creativity and hold a child's attention for hours.
080508990X|5.0|I bought this book to read for my one year old daughter. She just love it! She keeps saying before going to bed: &#34;bear, bear&#34;, which means that she wants me to read for her again.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is the best bookby Tim yet I feel, if not the best looking. I love all the color pictures and the overall quality of the printing...they just did a bang up job on it and it shows.<br /><br />There is so much knowledge packed in, it's definitely a guide on how to be sweet at life with a little cooking thrown in ;)<br /><br />I preordered this over a year ago and it was well worth the wait! cheers on another awesome book tim and thank you!!! I already loved to cook and was no way a novice but this definitely will take my game to the next level.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I purposely bought a digital copy of this movie so I can watch it on all my screens.  I can watch it over and over and it's still freaking hilarious.
0802473156|5.0|HELPED ME AND MY HUSBAND OUT ALOT.!!!!! NEVER THOUGHT A &#34;BOOK&#34; COULD DO THAT. I NEVER NEW ME OR MY HUSBAND HAD NEEDS LIKE THIS BOOK POINTED OUT.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|While it explains some of the aliens origins, it builds up way too much suspense and spends much too little time on actual climax and post-climax details.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Great product and service.  Snow white was the theme for movies at our house this Christmas.  My daughter loved it in her collection.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Lacks in authentic humor, although acting is good and story line hangs together.  I was bored at the time and it held up.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's a great game, fun and addicting, but sometimes the time doesn't pass in game when it should. When I hook up my kindle to charge overnight it seems like no time passes in the game so my babies aren't ready when they should be making me have to wait even longer for them and top be able to collect money. Otherwise it's a great game for a time lapse game.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|My wife ordered it.  It's so perverse I had to leave the room.  Even she admitted afterwords how disturbing it was.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good time killer, worth while free app! if you like creating cities, you will enjoy this game. takes a while to get going, but soon picks up the pace.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|While being another solid entry in this series its not my favorite.  Some of the dramas, especially the dragon lady's, are starting to get a bit tired with how long they are dragging on and how the characters continue to make the same mistakes constantly.  That being said there are some good chunks of high adventure, great plot thickenings all over, and exciting answers are provided along with the inevitable MORE questions that make you really hate how long these books take to release.  If you are a fan of the series this is totally worth buying.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Typical of the other MIB movies, this installment is witty and funny.  I wish they kept 'Zed' in the story line, but they made it work.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I've really enjoyed this series.  It has fairly good writing combined with a well thought out and exciting setting.  The combination of Victorian steampunk with some fairly unique fantasy science (the whole &#34;how supernaturals exist&#34;) make this a compelling addition to any fantasy or steampunk reader's library.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|While the movie was slow starting it did turn out to be a Good Movie.. NOT GREAT just Good Streamed Well
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Another Nolan's Batman, another weak and clueless Batman!  The movie is such a disaster! I would not even bother outlining all the plot holes and inconsistencies.  I recommend everyone to watch the witty fake trailer on YouTube.  I enjoyed it more than the movie itself.  And it is only 5 minutes long.
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this in the theatre, read all 3 books, watched it on Amazon streaming and still had to buy it.  I talked my husband into watching it, he enjoyed it even though he wouldn't quit asking questions through it.  Just kept telling him it's in the book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Although it is gory with blood,stabbing etc. It is a great book for teens or 11 year olds. Lots of details
B007U1FEJE|4.0|The Beach Boys still have it.<br />The reason why I didn't give it a 5 star is because it lacked a little of their &#34;beat&#34; they use to have. The song about God giving us the radio is very memorable, as I stayed tune to the radio for the Beach Boys and beyond in  the 60's/my teens.<br />BT
B00APUQT7I|5.0|We rented this via instant view and watched it with the kids.  It was funny and entertaining.  I recommend it.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|We liked most of the cuts, but I think Rod needs to stick to his rock style songs.<br />We'll listen to it because we love Rod, but it's not my favorite of my Christmas cds.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Black Keys do a nice job of having a classic rock feel without sounding like they came from the 70's. Well written lyrics and a unique style add depth to almost all the songs on this album. There is also a haunting quality in many of their songs. It kind of sticks in the back of your head and you hum it all day long. But not in the &#34;I need to get this out of my head way.&#34;
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The story line never gets boring! Great book.it was difficult to put down.I can't wait for the next book to be released.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use, adverts do not detract from this game, some customisation available. TIme flies by when you are playing.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this it makes me soooooo happy and i cant stop saying pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pie pienpie pie pie pie pie pie
B004S5C91Q|5.0|This book, with its unique narrative style had me hooked from the start. I cried, I laughed, I didn't want to put it down but at times I could hardly bare to read it. A definite 5 star book for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book...... What can I say Colleen did it again. I have yet to read a book of hers that I dd not like. Sky has never felt connected to any guy until she meets Holder. She feels things for him that she has never felt for anyone. However, Holder has a secret that he can't share, since he is scared that it might mean loosing Sky........AGAIN!!!
B009LRE040|1.0|I just finished watching 'The Dark Knight Rises' on Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />Or, as I will refer to it from here on out, TTHAFFMOMLIWB (The Two-Hours And Forty-Five Minutes Of My Life I Want Back).<br /><br />I had really looked forward to the film, as the first two Christian Bale Batman movies were actually pretty good. But this one sucked horribly. It was campy and corny where it was clearly supposed to be cool and edgy. It was uproariously funny where it was obviously intended to be deadly serious. The story line was jerky and hokey. The acting was way overdone. The characters all spoke as if they had a huge 'chaw' of Red Man tobacco in their mouths, and they needed to spit. The special effects were far from special.<br /><br />In summary, it was jaw-droppingly bad from start to finish.<br /><br />The only thing that was even close to good was Ann Hathaway's character. But it was a nickel's worth of halfway decent in a hundred million dollars worth of truly horrible.<br /><br />Please don't tell me there will ever be any more of these Batman flicks (I already know there's a 'Robin' in the works, but I'm lying to myself and I'm trying desperately to believe me). If I thought otherwise I would completely lose my faith in humanity.<br /><br />After viewing this loser I went back and watched the re-booted 2012 'Spider-Man' movie, which I wasn't all that impressed with the first time through. 'The Dark Knight Rises' made it --in retrospect-- look like a very well made comic book movie effort.<br /><br />Maybe the Iron Man and Avengers films have ruined me for all other comic book superhero movies. I don't know, and I don't care. Just please, please, please, never make me have to sit through that tripe-fest again! I have actually deleted it from my video library because I truly never intend to watch it again, no matter how much money I wasted. It was that bad.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|a big liam neeson fan.  loved him in the grey and taken--but this movie is not as good as those two.  the movie is longer than it needs to be and the plot is interesting--but it takes a little too long to get to the climax.  movie is very similar to the bourne series--international thriller type plot.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I own every book written by Mr King. This was a great short story.<br /><br />Can't wait for his next book
0451450523|4.0|The Last Unicorn is an interesting fantasy novel. It is, of course, the story of the last unicorn. One day, she leaves her forest and sets out to discover what happened to all the other unicorns. Along with the way, the unicorn meets with many people, Schmendrick the magician (who doesn't have that much magic) and Molly Grue. I'm not sure when I last read this fantasy, but it was a while ago.<br /><br />This is a surreal little concoction. The whole story seems dreamlike, unreal. It flows along at a slow but steady pace. Even the characters themselves say that they're in the midst of a fairy tale, which of course, they are. The unicorn lives forever, she's always present, and her eyes]...well, they enchant everyone who looks into them. Schmendrick and Molly are just two ordinary people brought along on an amazing adventure, full of witches, and curses, and doomed castles by the sea. But through it all is the question: what happened to the other unicorns?<br /><br />Peter S. Beagle's writing is yes, dreamlike, and also really descriptive. The first paragraph shows this very well, with analogies and rich imagery. I can imagine the unicorn, no longer careless, like sea foam, but more contemplative like snow falling on a moonlit night.<br /><br />The plot is superbly imagined, and the book flows very nicely. I had forgotten much of what happened, so it was almost like I was reading it afresh. The Last Unicorn is a fantasy classic in its own right, very different from more recent fantasy publications. There are many different editions, each with a beautiful cover. I have the \\"special anniversary edition\\".<br /><br />My book blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is awesome and addicting.  as my sister Jessie would say, pure awesomejess. Love It!  five star for sure.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love love love SOA.. huge fan.  I am addicted to it. I watched the first three season in one weekend..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing!  i really enjoyed slammed also. i cant wait for colleen hoover to write the next one.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|its nice being able to connect with family and friends with this app.  haven't played games with it yet but hope to connect with some soon.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Game is fun but would prefer tiles be a little easier to see patterns and would like to choose games by type rather than number.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I found this book  hard to get into story maybe should have hung in longer.  I really wanted to read this book before I see the movie
B0029O0BKO|5.0|This is a heart warming movie about a father trying to win his son's heart even the odds are against him. I watached this movie many years ago and I purchase it on Blue Ray as it is worth repeated viewing.The take away about this story is no matter how diffcult it is, there is a will , there is a way.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Rest assured this is for the whole family and each and everyone of them will love it! Must have for your movie collection.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I liked this book very much.  I felt the author could have described the way her hiking experience affected the person she became in more detail.
B002SRQ214|2.0|el ventilador ya esta fallando suena mucho tendre que cambiarlo, y es dinero extra, vibra y suena a temperatura de 50 C°
B006LSZECO|5.0|I wanted a book that entertained me.  This book did it in spades. I was hooked from the first page.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! It's so unique!  The adventures are creative and hard enough to keep me hooked.  I'm sold!
B004GHYCC0|5.0|PJ Harvey is an incredible musician. This album is nothing short of awesome. Both of her Mercury Prizes are well deserved.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I borrowed the 1st and 2nd book. Liked them so much that I purchased the third.<br />The story came together in the end. What a great ending. Can't wait to see the movie currently in the works.<br /><br />This book was indeed very different than the 1st two. Totally different games with lots of twist and turns.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So... my wife says let's watch this movie pitch perfect.... and mentions there might be some singing... right off the bat I am not too enthused but I look up the reviews and they are seem pretty ok... I am still not sold on it.  So she rents it with on demand and just starts watching it.. well, I walk though the living room and get caught by part of the opening bit that was quite surprising... I was all \\"Is this the signing movie?!\\" ... \\"yes\\" (she chuckled).  So I sat down and ended up watching the whole thing and really liking it.  I'm a guy who likes The Matrix, Star Wars, Blade Runner, LOTR and stuff like that... I do like the occasional high school comedy like 16 Candles, Weird Science, The New Guy, Can't Hardly Wait and others... and I do love music of all kinds.. It was goofy and fun enough to appeal to me in that way and the music was great actually.  We ended up watching it twice and now I have bought the blu-ray.  So there you go.  Very unexpectedly fun flick for a sci-fi / fantasy geek like me. :)
B0015DROBO|5.0|My Cardiologist suggested I read this book.<br />This is a great read. Grabed my attention from the very beginning. This is one of those books that you just can't put down until the last page. Lots of suspense throughout the whole book.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|If you liked the other ones, you will like this one too. Very funny, in that American pie kind of way.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|There was no stopping of reading this trilogy. Each book got better and better. I like the way all the answers came together in the 3rd book.  I had a lot of questions that weren't answered but zero once I completed the book.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br />Ok, so I don't think I have ever read a dystopian fiction. At least not one that I could remember. Maybe sometime during my school age years. Before, I always felt like I would have a hard time connecting because it's so fantastical. I wanted to give Delirium a try because it came so ridiculously highly recommended, it felt stupid not to. I will never be the same again. I can say, I am so happy to have finished 2012 (which was a pretty great year) with such an amazing book.<br /><br />{{It's so strange how life works: You want something and you wait and wait and wait and feel like it's taking forever to come. Then it happens and it's over and all you want to do is curl back up in that moment before things changed.}}<br /><br />Because I don't do any kinds of spoilers, this review will be short. If you read the synopsis, you will get the gist. Love is illegal. At the age of 18, you receive the \\"cure,\\" at which time you're paired with someone and given your occupation...all that jazz. Lena Haloway is 95 days out from this procedure. She's been waiting her lifetime over this - especially after the \\"disease\\" was the death of her mother when Lena was six. And then she met Alex.<br /><br />{{It's strange how I instantly recognize the voice even though I've heard it only once before, for ten minutes, fifteen tops - it's the laughter that runs underneath it, like someone leaning in to let you in on a really good secret in the middle of a really boring class.}}<br /><br />Alex shot his way into my heart literally from the first sentence he was introduced to me. He'll stay at the top of my fav book boys for all time now.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I HAD to stay up to finish a book. But I couldn't stop until I was done with this one. I had to know what was going to happen, and I was scared of the outcome. I can say, it literally left me speechless. And breathless. And then when I finally did go to bed, I opened my Kindle app on my phone and re-read the last couple pages JUST to make sure I hadn't ACTUALLY fallen asleep on the couch and dreamt what I thought I read.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver has the most beautiful prose. I was literally hooked from her first sentence (actually, I was hooked on a quote she gave during an interview on Amazon), so for me, this read just blew me away. As the story got more intense, her writing followed. The characters are so well-developed, the relationships so involved and intriguing and again, the actual prose, is just ridiculous. The way she weaves words is magic.<br /><br />{{Most things, even the greatest moments on earth, have their beginnings in something small.}}<br /><br />This book is a definite 5 star for me, but as is sometimes the case, it doesn't even feel like it can be on the same sort of scale I normally review on. It just rocked me that much. I know it's going to take some serious time to stop thinking about this story...but luckily for me, I was able to IMMEDIATELY download Pandemonium, so by the time this review goes live, I'm certain I'll be deep in the trenches of that. I hope to get some answers that I DESPERATELY need, but I'm sure I'll be left with even more questions. And then, the real task will be before me: waiting until March 5 for the final installment, Requiem. If I have one request from everyone for this year, it would be to PLEASE, step outside your comfort zone (if you don't normally read dystopian), and pick up this book. You WILL not be disappointed. So far from it.<br /><br />INITIAL THOUGHTS WHEN I FINISHED:: OMG. Definitely moving to the top of my all time favs list. Review to come. When I can breathe again. Hopefully sometime in early 2013. OMG.ges JUST to make sure I hadn't ACTUALLY fallen asleep on the couch and dreamt what I thought I read.    Lauren Oliver has the most beautiful prose.

B008XG1X18|2.0|Like the idea but it will not let me confirm e-mail address.  Kept saying it was wrong..If I could us it to its full advantage would really enjoy.
0553801473|2.0|I've had a difficult time getting through this book.  Unusual for me, given that in general I'd rather read that breathe once I'm into a series.<br /><br />This book wanders, and one does come away with the impression that it was written because the author HAD to write it, rather than any great passion for the storyline.<br /><br />I actually put it down a third of the way through and left it for almost 6 months, then started again to see if it moved any faster the second time around. Finished it, but only to see if ANY portion of the plot would actually RESOLVE. If you don't read quickly, from beginning to end, you are likely to get lost in the detail and perpetual subplots.<br /><br />As well, i am having a more and more difficult time with the graphic torture references; they seem gratuitous and rank, and intensely offensive without much point or plot purpose.<br /><br />I would not recommend.
1451695195|2.0|You have no doubt about NDE after reading this book... but it is just not well written! Give me a 'Dying to be me' by Anita Moorjani any day!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Very unique game. You draw anything you want for your character! I downloaded it as a F.A.O.T.D but it's well worth the .99
0470901071|5.0|Sybex does it again! This book includes the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How of network administration. The study guide gives full and detailed information and offers test questions, practice tests, and bonus material all on one easy to use CD. I love it. Wish me luck on the Exam!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|All it does is open a mobile version of Facebook in the web browser. Your probably will get the same functionality either way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished The Hunger Games two days ago, and now I just finished Catching Fire. Wow, I really love these books! I can't put them down! Well, I'm about to start Mockingjay, and I'm sure I'll give that 5 stars too!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like horror this is a great show. It jumps around and is hard to follow at times so make sure you watch the whole season,
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is great. I can't stop playing. The story line is good and there are so many diff mini games. Great graphics too.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I don't recommend.  I wanted to be able to view and update spreadsheets on my Kindle Fire Tablet that were created on my desktop. Have yet to figure out how to do it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book is one of those books that keeps you thinking about it long after it is finished. The story line and plot in this book was some of the best work I have seen in a long time. Blake crouch is definitely becoming one of my favorite authors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't put it down.<br />I already know it will be outstanding like all Nicholas Sparks other novels.<br />He is my favorite author.
B005LAII8K|1.0|A neat idea for a movie, but it just falls apart.  Rather than explain time travel and certain paradoxes, we are basically told not to think about it.  I assume it was too much trouble for the writer to figure out a good explanation of how the movie makes little sense.<br /><br />In comes the typical strange child halfway through the movie.  I wound up not caring about any of the characters by the end.<br /><br />The worst part was how boring the movie was and slow-paced . z. .. z. z..  I just expected a bit more.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I read up to 89% of my Kindle version and then quit the book.  I was so tired of the filthy language and the contrived plots and shallow characters, that I'd just had enough.
B0058YPL66|4.0|Very Imaginative.  Brings the Snow White tale to modern day cleverly.  Enjoyable, creative, fresh, bright and entertaining.  If you liek fairy tales younwill like this!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very addictive and enjoyable. Looks amazing on my HD tablets and on my phone. Great job! Can't wait for the updates.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can't stop playing!  Actually left the game running while I ate dinner so I'd have some coins waiting for me.  Fun game!
B004GJNFHG|5.0|I'm admitting my relative ignorance of the Troubles in Ireland and my cultural distance (I'm American, and yes, I found it very difficult to understand Fassbender's Belfast(?)accent at times). Regardless, I found this film masterful, because it uses the artistry of cinema to establish a third-person perspective of the events taking place at HM Prison Maze. I don't feel that the film tries to support republicans or loyalists, the cinematic perspective seems fairly unbiased. For many, yes, it would be heart-wrenching to watch someone starve to death, something we observe in the physician's response to Bobby starving, but we also see an officer shot point-blank in front of innocent people during his visit to a nursing home to see his mother. I also don't feel that the film is intentionally trying to \\"shock\\" anyone. The way everything is presented, from feces on the prison walls, to men being beaten, and finally self-inflicted starvation, the film seems to strive for neutrality. We as an audience are observing, and being allowed to develop individual opinions about what is taking place in front of us. It's a very poetic film, in that it understands silence and subtlety. When we do get dialogue it is poignant and meaningful; it is breaking an established silence with which we have become familiar.
B009HELT3C|4.0|It was very entertaining and fun to watch. We loved the ending and would like to see more in the series.
1401937519|5.0|Reading the NDE accounts of others always amazes me. How can anyone here on the planet not wonder what happens when we die? I have read many similar records. This one does get a bit repetitive at times, especially using the word, magnificence, but I suspect that is because Anita was so deeply moved by the discovery of her own profound value as a human being. I cannot help but feel somewhat envious that what I seek to accept on faith is for her a first-hand, life-transforming experience. So I will try to digest it, hold it in the realm of what is possible for all of us, grateful that Anita has shared her story in great detail. I wish I knew her personally and could hear first hand how she now views life.<br />What question is more important for us than &#34;What am I doing here?&#34;<br />Thanks, Anita......Sara Zimmerman

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Out of all the books in this series this was by far my favorite. I don't want the series to be over. The ending left me wanting... more!
B004XISI4A|5.0|The writing style of GRR Martin is second to none. I understand a lot of people were not happy with the formatting of this book and the previous book, however formatting aside, the in depth story and superb writing which GRR Martin has created make this book and the previous four the best books I've read since The Power of One.<br /><br />There are very few individuals capable of such a feat as this series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the action and suspense in this book! Haven't put my kindle down since Christmas! Now onto the third book!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I missed my favorite characters in book 4,  Danaerys/Tyrion. However I am dying to find out what happens to my other favorite chararacter Aryan.

0071636080|4.0|I got this book because my job has requires me to make frequent presentation.<br /><br />I believe every company has its own set of &#34;template&#34; or must-have.<br /><br />I have integrated much of the points discussed in this book into my presentation and it has worked pretty well.<br /><br />Pro:<br />Easy and pragmatic advice.<br /><br />Con:<br />Some of the advices are cater to public speaking or larger scale presentation or product presentation.<br />Not everyone of us do such presentation. We are more likely to do sales forecast, sales report, project status updating, etc.<br />The book doesn't cover such area where it will be more applicable to most junior executives.<br />Thus, you have to make your own interpretation based on the author's example.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy watching the series and the actors involved, we have the first one - thanks again
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Takes me back to the old arcade days. Plays beautifully and is totally addicting. The music and the game sounds make it more intense. Have fun!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I enjoy watching movies with Johnny Depp - he is a great actor in every roll he plays in .  thanks
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. I think everyone can relate to Charlie is some way. His outlook on life, hi complete honesty and his true emotions make him seem almost like... I don't know. Like you want to know him. It's an inspiring novel, and I think everyone, old and young, should read it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This movie had a very weak and predictable plot with several rehashed family guy jokes thrown in.  It was just plain disappointing.
B006885EFE|5.0|My father and and his brothers all served in WWII never talked about it I now have an real idea what they went thru as well as all the others .  Watch this and have a real fell for what they sacrificed for all of us.

B009NTNHJU|5.0|BEST!!!!!!!!!!! ALBUM IT WAS HERE IN 3 DAYS GREAT PACKAGE LOVE NICKI MINAJ SHE IS TOO AWESOME FOR WORDS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM WITH THE DVD
0307200477|1.0|I love this classic book.  I have bought a copy for each of my four children. This deluxe edition is bigger than the previous copies we have owned.  The spiral binding comes apart every time you read the book, even if it is handled gently.  I do like the additional pages that some of the other copies we have owned did not contain.  Definitely not worth the extra $.  Buy the smaller version, it holds up better.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|From start to finish, this album is phenomenal.  Favorite songs include the cover title, Blown Away, and Forever Changed!  Buy it, you won't regret it.

B00AJLHUA8|4.0|\\"Sinister\\" is a little horror film that made the rounds of small theaters coincidental with its video release. I saw it yesterday in a mall theater in Grand Rapids, Mich. It's the story of an author (Ethan Hawke) who writes about grizzly murders for a living, moving himself and his family (wife plus two kids) to the whereabouts of the killings for his book research. In this film, his family has moved to the home where the murdered family lived and where the deeds occurred. And, this time, the intrepid journalist gets a lot more than he bargained for, receiving clues about the murders no one else knows from who knows where.<br /><br />The production involves many typical horror film tricks -- loud noises and things that go bump in the night, ghostly visions of what may or may not be people, townspeople at odds with the principal characters because they are revisiting the murders that rocked their neighborhood, machines that turn themselves on after everyone goes to bed, the usual malcontented children, one of whom can't sleep through the night without going into something like night shock. And on and on. All the odd noises and strange goings-on happen in the dark, of course.<br /><br />But a few clever plot contrivances, a marginally serpentine story that will keep you vested, and some originality save this little film from being just another exercise in horror film ho-hum. I can't tell you the best part because it would spoil the end and disclose the denouement. However, I can tell you that neither my wife nor I -- who are 65 and 62 years old, respectively, and veterans of hundreds of horror films in the theater and at home -- could guess how the film would be resolved and what would happen at the end. If neither of us can guess how a movie is going to end -- and you get a few clues in the last half-hour of \\"Sinister\\" -- then it is in my book an effective movie.<br /><br />Be forewarned, the opening scene of \\"Sinister\\" is fairly grizzly in itself. Having seen the opening, I was fearful the movie would venture into X-rated territory but it did not. It is R-rated for intensity, adult content, scenes of murder, language and blood but the movie does not particularly manifest anything the average horror film maven would consider bad taste in 2012. See this in the small theater, like we did, or on your 55-inch TV and prepare yourself for a good horror story.ening, I was fearful the movie would venture into X-rated territory but it did not.

B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is very enjoyable and a great way to kill time.  doesnt seem to put any lag on my kindle.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|a great collection of songs and the album overall keeps true to the theme, music, style, & emotional feel that is Halestorm.
0763657875|4.0|If you have a friend in love with London, this pop up book makes a nice small fun gift.  They can recall their last visits to the Tower of London, etc., etc.
B0026P7O6K|4.0|this album is actually my fave as it holds more of the &#34;singles&#34; i like from Halestorm.  i rated it lower only because the other albums seem more cohesive than this 1 did for me.  the album cover art makes me scratch my head, but i listen to them for music so... art is art.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|difficult to find fb members to play with. old member who have played not removed.otherwise like the game very much.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great tale!<br />Unfortunately suffers from 19th century novelists' love of immense detail (hence sections of great tedium - in particular the interminable description of the Battle of Waterloo). Still, a wonderfully detailed account of the life of the unfortunates in France of the period wrapped in an absorbing narrative.
B002NZTZ8S|3.0|It was an entertaining movie, but I wouldn't see it again. It just wasn't that compelling. My kids liked it but didn't love it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A good story. Very entertaining.  Emotional, surprising, and thrilling.  I Am excited to learn what happens in the next book..
B001E5CH0G|5.0|We couldn't find our copy of this movie so of course we had to order a new one because it wouldn't be Christmas without it.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Did not live up to the hype and did the original a huge injustice by straying way off the beaten path from the original story line.  The special effects and action was the movies only redeeming qualities, however, the story line was woefully lacking.
B000KI6286|5.0|The movie's amazing--funny, instructive, brilliant, unique. Aaron Eckhart was born this role. Obviously it's a bit of a &#34;moderate R&#34; with a fair bit of language, but other than that, no complaints.<br /><br />Regarding Amazon's viewing quality, it was pretty good. Straightforward service, subtitles (to my surprise), and no hang-ups. Bit of flickering white lines on the image though, so I'd give it a 4/5.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|My husband and I always enjoy watching this movie and this movie is the perfect movie to see in 3D. The 3D graphics definitely enhance the robot action and adventure.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Purchased this for my son for Christmas, he loved receiving the Trilogy, and the movies were great.  The price was amazing.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|It works pretty good and I am able to mesure my daily training with confidence and easily. I recommend this product.

B006JSXYPA|5.0|This video is incredible in 3D. It was a gift for a relative and he absolutely loves it. Viewed on a 3D TV and 3D BluRay player, it was just like going to a movie on the big screen.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is one of my favorite musicals.  I love this.  The emotions are right there,  you can feel the anguish, and despair in their voices.  I would recommend this.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Except that everything uses energy and I like to play quickly. Would rather buy a full game, than pay real money (ten dollars for enough coins to buy two buildings, I don't think so) or litter up my Facebook.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's a hard book to put down!  Very exciting and imaginative and extremely scary especially since it is entirely possible as our own government grows and grows!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's awesome for a free game, with a lot of levels!! I have never really played Angry Birds before and I enjoyed it. I highly recommend it. =)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This app is my favorite game on my kindle fire. It has various levels and each level had a hint to help you through. My favorite part is that some levels have multiple winning routes to take you to different paths on the main map with all the levels. I have been playing since last night and I am now on the final level fighting the evil king. So addicting.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! I can sit and just play and play!! I love how as you play, you unlock new blades and backgrounds. It's great for when you are waiting around for whatever reason and need something to help you pass the time. =)
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I was excited to receive this case. I wanted a water proof case that I can use daily and one that would protect my phone if I drop it.<br /><br />This case is water proof (I tested it under water in the sink for over an hour). It appears to protect the phone well. It is not functional for everyday use though.<br />1) It claims that the sound switch on your iPhone can be turned on and off when it's in the case. This was not the case for me. I couldn't turn the sound on and off with the button on the case.<br />2) The case caused issues with my touch screen<br />3) The case also interferes with texting.<br /><br />I will not return the case, mainly becuase I threw out the packaging, but it's pretty useless to me. I might use it when I go camping or am at a pool or beach.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this one.
B0099114WO|5.0|I am sure that most couples can relate to this story. It is very funny and very sweet. I absolutely loved it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|So far this is a fun game with some interesting traders in the first few chapters.  I look forward to finishing.
0061808121|5.0|As shown in the pictures and description, the item came wrapped in its original paper, displaying the original price. It wasn't scratch or anything and the cost was awesome.  Even if I asked Amazon to wrap it for me and paid more, and they didn't...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You won't want to put it down! It was an amazing read! It's a love story with a suspenseful twist.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think survivalcraft demo is way better than the originals. Even when it only gives you 15min. You can always go back to your last checkpoint.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Really liked the movie.  Good action, characters, plot.  I like Daniel Craig as Bond..well done!  It's done in a very classic Bond style!  Will try and rent the next one and catch Skyfall in theaters!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This story is like chocolate, I'm addicted. I can't have just a little... I need more!!! Hurry with book three.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book tugged at the heartstrings. It's a good, quick read if you want a temporary escape from the real world. Although some material is a bit heavy, the love story keeps you reading.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|My opinion is that it doesn't give u enough time to play the game, and the One u have to pay for is a lot of money. Don't get this game! I'm warning u! DO NOT GET GAME!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was really disapponited.  Not much substance.  Save your money!  Everyone was talking about it and I thought I'd join the &#34;bandwagon&#34; but it was dissappointing.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is ADDICTING, AWESOME, and A FULL FIVE STARS! Why? I think it's ADDICTING, AWESOME, and a full five stars because I think it's great for all ages, easy, and FREE! The other night my cousin was playing it on my kindle fire, and I couldn't get my kindle away from him! His mom had to talk to him, and finally he let me play. Rate full five stars EVERYBODY! U should really get it! Thanks for listening to my opinion.

B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I wasnt crazy about this new album.....I think i was liking the song choice more than the singing....It felt a bit flat for me....no real emotion in her singing.....not that there ever was much emotion in some of her songs but this album just didnt move me like her others.....but I do like the song choices....
1451695195|5.0|A wonderful soul searching book that made my heart beat a bit faster; it was written from the heart. How wonderful to have a doctor whose life was based on facts and results show that God is always there; even though at times we do not feel His presence.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|I really liked this book. It provides fresh air to the economic growth debate. Why some countries grow whilst others remain poor; that's something everybody should learn a bit. The author is a brilliant economist. The only flaw of this book, in my opinion, it's the following: the ideas and suggestions are really interesting, but their exposition is way repetitive. It's not such a big issue, but take it into account; it's worthwhile reading the whole book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great characters with wonderful costuming.  Of course the homes, landscapes are fantastic.  We are looking forward to Season 3 starting this month.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book!  Not much more I can say about it than that!  I hope that she is happy with her choice as I am happy with mine!
B000JCSBU0|4.0|One of those movies you keep replaying in your head after seeing it, very original interplay of two story lines.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A great love story, easy to read and grabs your attention.<br />many different themes of good vs evil, what is one without the other etc-which makes it good for book club discussion<br />It was hard to follow towards the end, certain characters got abondened within the story without good resolution of their characters
B0042RJWTC|4.0|1 of the DVD's was missed label with how many episodes was on it but other than that , Great!
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Well paced and informative. I was gripped by the human drama and also learned much about how the crisis happened.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Truly a pure and honest book that shows life as it is and should be with the ups and downs that always come and go.
030759565X|5.0|Have followed the author's blog for several years and was excited about her upcoming  cookbook.  ordered it it last week.  when it arrived, I spent several hours reading through it. Like Deb's Smitten Kitchen Blog, her cookbook does NOT disappoint.  Her writing style is enjoyable and her photographs are stunning. I like that the recipes are not the average recipes. As I turned the pages, I added yet another recipe to my mental list of recipes I want to make!  Deb  has come up with so many exciting and flavorful (and sometimes unique:  ie the roast chicken with kalamata olives and seedless grapes which was delicious!) dishes.  I can see myself making most of the recipes.  To date, I  made four of Deb's recipes this week and all were successful and delicious and I will  make each of them again.  I love that the ingredients are easily obtained at the local local grocery store and the recipes are easy to follow.  As others mentioned, the layout isn't typical of most recipe books, but the quality of the recipes and the book in general overcomes that issue.  I would recommend this recipe collection to everyone..as a gift for a friend and for yourself...
B000HT3JNY|4.0|This story was fabricated quite well. You got your average Joe (Adam Sandler) working for a firm where he's busts his butt to get some recognition, plus some sort of promotion.  He's so focused on his job that he tends to neglect his family, canceling vacation plans and fails to show up for school events, etc. however, in the long run, he's working hard so that his family can have more.<br /><br />In reality, many people don't realize that they are inadvertently dissing their family while thinking that they are trying to be successful in their job. Many people don't see it, but that's why some spouses leave their husbands because they are never home for them or the children.  They don't know how to appreciate what they have because they always want more. Or, their superiors tell them that they will earn a promotion for continually conquering challenges thrown at them, while all the while, the superior enjoys all the benefits that the employee worked hard for. Most all employers are the evil puppeteers of this true reality that seems to break up homes.<br /><br />In this film, Morty is subsequently, the devil in the flesh.  He gives Michael Newman a remote control.  But, not one that controls his TV. It is one that controls his life. By using the remote control, he make all his own choices. What he wants to do, what he wants to skip. He just jumps ahead (with the skip chapter button on the remote) so he can get past the unpleasant things he wishes to avoid.  What he thinks should be just a few days, actually ends up being years into the future. Years of losing all the wonderful things he could have done with his family, if he didn't go and put his job first.<br /><br />The spin on this film that makes it so devastatingly real, is that, if we could skip all the unpleasantness of our lives we would just find ourselves deeper into the future, and no closer to gaining all that we strive for. In fact, we would only see what we've lost, when trying so hard to have more.<br /><br />So people have said, that \\"this is not a comedy\\". Well, comedy was there only to make it so it wouldn't be so depressing.  If all the comedy was taken out, this would feel like an extremely horrific episode of the \\"Twilight Zone\\" with all the outcomes of reality in tact. I think this would be a great movie to play during the Christmas season because people need to remember that: \\"Family comes first!\\" Forgetting that, is why some families fall apart./><br />So people have said, that \\"this is not a comedy\\".

B00571F26Y|5.0|As a type 2 diabetic, diagnosed for 15 years,  I can honestly say I never understood how foods impacted my blood glucose : until this book!  Although at times heavy with terminology ,  it is extremely informative and makes you think about that next slice of bread. Who knew a hot roll could be the enemy? I am so pumped to try this and am ordering the cookbook today! Will write a future review,  hopefully with pounds lost and other positive results.
B0037QGS0A|3.0|Never heard or seen this movie till I bought it on Amazon.  Never knew Amanda Seyfried could play a vicious girl.  It has a big twist at the end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Hard to find objects no instructions on how to play. try to upgrade for a full program is useless I tap and tap with no results. I try to energize and can not. I love the program but it shuts down And what are some of the buttons for????<br />I want more of this kind of game even on ma main computer. My A/C adapter and a few others no longer operates.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan than this book is a MUST HAVE, I for one love his novels and his always romantic storylines. This book only made me much more of a fan because all of the characters became very real from the beginning and they all have secrets that don't come out all at once. The book itself was such a hard one to put down and it was full of suspense and I was frightened at some points to chills. You know the main character is hiding from something or someone.. but what? You will have to read this one to find out!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and easy to play. Reminded me how much I enjoy playing this game, so much nicer to have it electronically. And it was free - can't beat that!
1439102732|5.0|I have to say first and foremost that this book is one of the best Picoult novels in her more recent books (I wasn't a fan of Harvesting the Heart). The storyline is one that is both unique, heartbreaking, and will make you a bit angry until the very end. I loved reading this book because it was very modern in both today's laws concerning gay marriage, frozen embryos, and custody, the author really seems to have done all of their research in the making of this novel. I would definitely recommend this to everyone no matter your beliefs concerning the touchy subject matters.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to watch the movie because the story seemed so horrible. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and had to read the books! I am not a big reader and finished it in 2 days...starting the 2nd one tonight!
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Nicholas Sparks rarely disappoints me but he has managed to with 'The Best of Me'. It had been awhile since he put out a new book and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it, when I first started reading it I was engrossed with the story of the young couple Amanda and Dawson. They were very young and in love but had both of their families trying to push them apart. However, in just a few pages it jumps to them in their 40s both with new lives --Amanda with a husband and children and Dawson fresh out of prison. It follows their journies as they are lead back into each other's lives with the help of an old friend and guardian. It slowly got less interesting and I felt it was a tedious and slow paced read. The story was again old and worn out--the married woman wanting her young love and the alcholic husband. The ending while supposed to be suprising was oh so predictable and not thought provoking.
B00009NHC5|5.0|What tension this film creates!  I highly recommend this film as a study for all actors for the use<br />of physicality, focus and the ability to create alternate stage experiences.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Loved this one, enjoyed the inclusion of Malcolm Fox and impression of him from another point of view, hope there are still more Rebus stories to come.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's fun to play, especially when you need to while a day away sick on the couch, It's not brain intensive, and can sometimes feel slightly redundant, but interesting enough to keep me going. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love to play this game because if you fall down you can buy angel wings and you can go again.

B008GFI418|5.0|If Sir George Martin is not the greatest producer in the history of modern music, he certainly comes close.  He not only passed on a lot of his vast musical knowledge to his artists, he also let them develop their individual talents to the fullest, in contrast to producers like David Foster and Simon Cowell, who developed a &#34;signature sound&#34; that makes all of their recordings sound the same, regardless of the performer.  Martin also is a true English gentleman who has more class than Simon Cowell (or Piers Morgan) will ever have.  Actually, Cowell and Morgan have a lot of class, if you delete the &#34;C&#34; and the &#34;L.&#34;<br /><br />This wonderful documentary, originally broadcast on the BBC, runs the gamut of Sir George's life, from his Depression-era childhood, to his World War II service in the Fleet Air Arm, to his musical education at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, to his start with EMI's tiny Parlophone label (as an assistant to Oscar Preuss) in 1950; he became the head of Parlophone when Preuss retired in 1955.  The EMI &#34;big boys,&#34; according to Martin, were His Master's Voice (HMV) and Columbia, mainly because of their longstanding ties to RCA Victor and Columbia/CBS Records in America, respectively.  When EMI lost the RCA and CBS contracts in the 1950s, EMI then purchased Hollywood-based Capitol Records, primarily to obtain new American product.  Oddly enough, today, Parlophone is the longest continuously surviving EMI label, though other imprints (e.g., Stateside Records, and the on-again, off-again Regal Zonophone label [now two separate imprints, Regal Recordings, a Parlophone specialty label, and Zonophone, used primarily as a reissue label for Capitol and other back-catalog product]) have been revived and folded from time to time.  The Columbia Graphophone Company was folded into the larger EMI Records label in the early-to-mid-1970s, and the Columbia trademark itself was transferred to Sony Music (the new owners of CBS Records) in the early 1990s.  HMV became a classical-only label by the end of the 1960s (except for a few Morrissey recordings issued with retro HMV labels in 1988, at the artist's insistence) and was later folded into EMI Classics (now Warner Classics).  EMI also sold off the HMV music store chain to new ownership in the late 1990s, and transferred the Nipper-and-gramophone trademark (except in America, where it is owned by RCA Trademark Management) to HMV Group PLC in 2003.  With EMI's 2013 takeover by Universal Music Group, Parlophone was one of several EMI labels sold to Warner Music Group because of European Union antitrust concerns. The Beatles' catalog will still be owned by UMG, under either a new Capitol Records UK imprint or Universal Music International; whether The Beatles' older albums and CDs (the first eight, from [[ASIN:B0025KVLRO Please Please Me]] to [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]) will still be pressed with historic Parlophone labels (with a licensing fee paid to Warner Music Group, the new owners of Parlophone) or reissued with Capitol UK labels is unknown at the present time.  Another possibility is that The Beatles' entire catalog may be shifted to the Apple label, as was the case with U.S., German, and Japanese reissues (and possibly other countries as well) in the 1970s.<br /><br />Sir George's most famous signing was, of course, The Beatles, in 1962, but his range of artists that he produced over his 50-plus year career included jazz (Humphrey Lyttleton, John Dankworth, and his wife-to-be Cleo Laine), pop chanteuses such as Shirley Bassey, comedy (Peter Sellers, The Goon Shows, Rolf Harris of &#34;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&#34; fame, [[ASIN:B000006SW2 The Complete Beyond The Fringe (1961 Original London Cast)]], and the music for [[ASIN:B000008LIL That Was the Week That Was: Classic TV Satire of the 1960's]], which was also produced in the U.S. on NBC), other British Invasion acts (Billy J. Kramer With The Dakotas, Gerry And The Pacemakers, Cilla Black), and the solo Beatles (Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr's [[ASIN:B000007MVU Sentimental Journey]], and one posthumously orchestrated track, &#34;Grow Old With Me,&#34; on [[ASIN:B00000DG1Q The John Lennon Anthology]]).  Martin was also successful with the group America, and his final work was with son Giles (a fine producer in his own right) for The Beatles' Cirque du Soleil show, [[ASIN:B000JJS8TM Love (CD + Audio DVD)]] and its companion documentary, [[ASIN:B0032E9I6S All Together Now: A Documentary Film]].<br /><br />There are interviews with Sir George's wife Lady Judy, son Giles, Sir Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Rolf Harris, Cilla Black, singer Millicent Martin (no relation), and others.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read Heaven is For Real and The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven... both wildly popular recently.  Let me just say that this book blows those two away.  I wouldn't even call the book \\"religious.\\"  It is simply a scientific account of a near-death experience of a world renowned neurosurgeon.  The most refreshing part was that the author was not a big-time believer before the experience.  He was a skeptic very far from his faith.  It is only through his experiences, that he learns the secrets of the universe and the true purpose of life.<br /><br />As a Christian, so many things that are presented in this book directly line up with scripture.  Time and time again, I kept finding myself with \\"Aha\\" moments.  Things that I believed but couldn't quite put my finger on until now.<br /><br />I truly couldn't put the book down, and now I encourage all my friends (both believers and non-believers) to read the book.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your story with the world!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book wad great. It kept you guessing, you could really relate to the characters. I highly recommend this book!
B008QOH1NG|1.0|It was the worst dvd i every bought.  production was good, but their best song honestly was done with just a piano no strong ballad and if that wasnt enogh, he had the crowd sing most of the lyrics.  DONT BUY THIS
0316228532|3.0|Casual Vacancy left me disappointed. Disappointed that such a huge runaway success of a book could be so poor in literary content. To me it was just a paper-thin story, perhaps even a fantasy of the author that she now felt safe in committing to paper. There is too much emphasis on telling us about the multitude of characters and not enough on allowing the story to tell itself to a point where the plot disappears under the weight of the characterisations and the cloying social comment. It's that weak plot that destroys the book; the political manoeuvring to fill the casual vacancy on the council and in turn control the jurisdiction under which a particular community will find itself administered. Really, it's not that exciting.<br /><br />Further to the book having any real interest grabbing story line, it is heralded as a book for adults. This is not surprising as the author obviously still wants to be taken seriously by the literati as opposed to someone who was able to churn out a string of children's books. It is not an adult book. It is a book for young adults, and this highlights the flaw in the novel, the audience that the author subconsciously wrote the book for will focus on the fictional youths in their flush of early adult awareness; and both parties could care less about the machinations of a purely adult contrivance.<br /><br />I can't say I didn't like the book exactly, but it in no way deserves the accolades that are being heaped upon it.
B008CX2A2I|2.0|The Bluetooth needs to have a control menu in the firmware of the receiver. Every time I use the Iphone or Ipad the 717 reciever turns on. This would happen even after deselecting the phone or pad to use its internal speakers. Removing the Bluetooth from the 717 causes a complete lost and re bind of the device to device.  Firmware update will fix Bluetooth menu with a simple do not turn on the receiver if a Bluetooth signal is received.<br /><br />I am probably going to send back the UBT-1 Bluetooth too Amazon unless I soon hear ONKYO is working on a firmware update to address the above problems.
1449433251|5.0|I bought this for my father, a huge fan of the comic series, and the paperback series complete and neatly preserved in the box what exactly what I wanted. He thoroughly enjoys them as it is easy to read and store. Thank you!

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|LIke all of us I waited impatiently for this film. I saw it in the theatre, then bought the DVD, wanting to be sure. Prometheus, aside from some good production work and visuals, is so ill-thought out one wonders if it were written by Mr. Scott's dog.<br /><br />The numerous howlers and structural gaffes have been well documented in other reviews, I won't make you suffer through them again. The most human character is David, the android (Fassbender is terrific). Almost every other character is embarrassing and ill-conceived (don't blame the actors).<br /><br />Of course we can accept honorable failures in art. It happens. What I wonder is how this lousy script got written approved and produced? Ridley Scott will stay in the pantheon of course, for Alien and Blade Runner, but Prometheus? Those whom the Gods would destroy.... I'll be trading in my copy at Amoeba toward something good.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm not an avid reader and I sometimes have a hard time getting into slow starting Stephen King novels.  Not so with this one.  It got me in the first chapter and I was reluctant to put it down.  I like a good time travel yarn anyway and this one filled the bill.  His period and geographic references obviously took a lot of research and it paid off with a very believable piece of fiction.
1439181780|5.0|Good POWER-ful book. Okay that was cheesy, but it really was a good book and helps remind you that everyday you have the power inside you to change your future and love life.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|so many forbidden things, such as explicit sex, explicit violence, and the superexplicit spectacle of them available now were forbidden, or nearly,  when i was a kid.  every story worthy of the name has something to say, to us about us.  the original scifis tended to be progressive by definition, and often included some desperate dilemma, moral message, or sardonic twist.  things have changed; now gore, glamour and empty spectacle are so often visited upon us that attempt to either shock or dazzle, without really having much to say, or even worse, refusig to (will i EVER recover from the vapid prometheus?  time will tell; i  still have hopes).  not so, l.  it has good scifi elements, a provocative story to tell that could not be without them, and an imaginative ending that actually SOLVES (ridley) a puzzle for us, and in an imaginative and satisfying way. personally, i have always found people to be rather dull and predictable, which makes saying something interesting about them rather difficult.  which is apparently why really good scifi tends to be so scarce now, even in the midst of this superexplosion of technical knowledge.
B0053O89RY|5.0|It is so funny and I really enjoyed it. It was a gift to my daughter and she shared it with me.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I too started the Jack Reacher series because of the new movie \\"One Shot\\". I can't believe they chose Tom Cruise to play Reacher!!! I liked this book so much I am now on #6 in the series, reading one or two a week if I can find the time. He (Reacher) is a strange and fascinating character and Childs comes up with the most intricate plots that keep you reading as fast as you can to try to figure out \\"who done it\\"!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think it was good. Not the best but it was good. I wasn't crazy about it but it was fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one starts really easy and sucks you in. Then the fun begins!  These are wonderfully frustratingly challenging puzzles. I love puzzles and this one fits the bill.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|this is an awesome product because it didnt stop at any time and it looked new. In the future i might purchase another product.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I probably should have waited another day to write this review just to get my head on straight. I honestly wasn't sure how to feel about the book when I first started. But as soon as the flash backs began my heart broke. As soon as Holder came into the picture I knew I was I trouble. It was funny, heartbreaking, sexy (Holder and his &#34;firsts&#34;), frustrating...it was a beautiful story.
B00005JPMZ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  It's a great action and family film! There should be more like this!<br />What I really loved about it was the mythological warrior king plot and how that played into how the turtle brothers operated as a family.  The details focusing on Leo and Raph's bond were very well done; though I feel that a little more screen time could have been devoted to Donnie and Mikey and how they were handling the situation.  But overall, it was a great movie! Two thumbs way up!! :)
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Like many others have noted this book is a bit slower than the rest. Danearys lingers in Meeren with each chapter very similar to the last; not to say there isn't any plot in her chapters it is just slow going. I found Jon's and Arrya's chapters to be the most invigorating filled with northern action with the black brothers and the wildlings, and the faceless men training respectively. It is still a good book that leaves me waiting for the next, but compared to the others it falls a little short.<br /><br />On the re-read the familiarity with Meerenese names helped a lot with understanding the plot. At least I didn't have to worry if it was hizzar hozzar or some other strange combination.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This game while entertaining, has significant technical and online issues, coupled with intrusive advertising comparable to that of Zynga's FarmVille which this game copies to a tee. If you like Facebook games, and have patience to deal with significant synchronization issues resulting in progress loss, this game may be for you, even if the rock paper scissors styled combat is unbalanced if your opponent has paid actual money into the game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was definitely one that had me wanting to read more to see what happened next. I was in disbelief at how it ended though. I wanted there to be more. I kept swiping my Kindle in hopes to find more after the acknowledgements. Or swiping back because maybe I skipped pages. Regardless of the end, I would still recommend this book. The story is twisted and insane. Quite the mystery.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This was a great book. It was a book filled with mystery.<br />And great mystery. Gregory needs to get a date for the school dance. Read the book to find out more.
1400067820|1.0|Antifragile is an armchair philosopher's view of the way the world works based on the author's personal biases and personal interpretations of personally selected, non-inclusive events described as revealed truth because the author is unable to make a false perception in his own considered opintion.  The few strengths and the many limitations of this book have been summarized in many of the already-listed reviews; I am only adding my review to add to the total weighting of the book for the unwary reader.<br /><br />An old Polish proverb notes that \\"one cannot sell from an empty cart.\\"  Nicholas Nassim Taleb, has one item in his cart:  there are situations in which severe disruption can lead to a competitive advantage for those who are not entrenched in the established order, and Taleb spends considerable effort trying to convince the reader that Taleb himself is a living example.  These severe disruptions are known as \\"Black Swans\\" thanks to Taleb's previous book of the same name about discontinuous change.  In that context, it is interesting to note that Diderot wrote:  \\"Swans have an air of being proud, stupid, and mischevious--three qualities that go together.  Given that so much of Antifragile is based on Taleb's experience, it is quite possible that Taleb's experiences describe Taleb himself.<br /><br />The book is similar to going to a family Thanksgiving renunion, in which your spouse's crazy uncle Eddie starts out by quoting studies on the importance of breakfast and then goes off the rails to explain how he personally is fighting a conspiracy by Washington bureaucrats, former Soviets, and elite Ivy-League universities to prevent the production and distribution of corn flakes.<br /><br />The notion that discontinuous change can happen, and that some can gain advantage from it, is useful.  Taleb provides numerous, cherry-picked, examples--half of which are insightful and half of which are ill founded.  Among the latter are Taleb's view of innovation and the importance of infrastructure, which is completely contradicted by historical data, most concisely summarized in Michael Lind's Land of Promise.<br /><br />The problem for the reader with an author that is right approximately half the time is captured by Claude Shannon, in his classic work on entropy (disorder) in digital communication channels.  Shannon noted that disorder is minimized (as expected) in a communication channel which sends a digital \\"one\\" that is ALWAYS received as a digital \\"one\\" by the receiver and a digital \\"zero\\" is ALWAYS received as a digital \\"zero.\\"  However, Shannon also noted that disorder is also minimized in a communication channel that sends a digital \\"one\\" that is ALWAYS received as a digital \\"zero\\" and in which a digital \\"zero\\" is ALWAYS received as a digital \\"one\\"--because in this latter case, the receiver knows that the answer is always wrong.  Entropy (disorder) is maximized in the case where half the digital ones are received as zeros and vice versa--and that's Taleb's book.<br /><br />So, I advise the causal reader to avoid this book.  As there is only one coherent idea in the entire 519 pages, I give this book a rating of only one star.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well done piece of suspense. A lot of twists and turns that kept the pages flying. The ending was quite unexpected.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|This board game came exactly as it was described, and it's fun to play with all your nerdy nintendo friends!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is an awesome news reader. I was using News360 before on Android but since I installed Flipboard I haven't gone back. Still using News360 on Windows 8 however - at least until Flipboard develops a compatible version.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a true page turner. It is well written and totally captures the readers heart and  soul. Would highly recommend
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I've used Evernote for quite awhile to take notes on my Android tablet and be able to share and edit them on any PC with a web browser. Not as nice as Microsoft OneNote, but at least it's cross platform. Nice to see that it runs on the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Got this for the free app of the day and am greatly surprised.  I am an got into this game am hooked. Drawing solutions is pretty fun.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I found this to be a nice addition to the regular musical Soundtrack.  It's different...often more spoken than sung...which I believe was a deliberate decision by the director in order to make the movie more understandable.  It may be off putting for the musical purists...but it's probably a good decision in order t make the story more accessible to a wider audience.  It's well done and a great listen.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not your typical &#34;I figured it all out in a minute&#34; story.<br />It takes a few minutes, but it's told well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Whoa, this book was EPIC. I can not express how much this book took a hold of me and still has not let me go! I laughed, I cried, I screamed at it and I smiled a lot! If you are asking yourself if the people that gave this less than a 5 star review are crazy, then I'm going to answer that question for you. Yes, they are CRAY. Like 50 shades of cray. No, seriously they are allowed their opinion....but it is a wrong one :0
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could NOT put this book down and was sad when I finished the book because I did not want it to end. This well-written novel explores a sweet. passionate, and complicated love story between the protagonists. Abby and Travis. The author was able to create a great story with wonderful characters that takes you on an emotional roller coaster of a ride. I really enjoyed how the protagonists' relationship evolves from friendship to love rather than the instantaneous \\"love at first sight\\" thing that most love stories have taken to. It was a real relationship that portrayed the beautiful and messy sides a relationship can take.<br />I absolutely loved this book and am looking forward to reading more from this author. I would definitely recommend this book!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Don't have to be at the mercy of tv channels to watch this movie.  Always a good message, great to have it in original and colorized.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING loved it  excitingly fun page after page<br />Thanks for an exciting page turner Suzanne can not wait to read book two
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I have never found a show more enthralling than Breaking Bad. I always thought the Sopranos was one of the best written shows ever, I think Breaking Bad is right up there. The pace of Breaking bad is different from the Sopranos, but the writing, acting, AMAZING. It's now my top.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|The only good part of this whole film was seeing Gina Gershon half naked, love Matthew McConaughey as an actor but this film has to be a total embarassment to him.
1419705849|4.0|Pretty good, with lots of humor and a twist  ending that will confuse and delight the reader. That is a universal rule.
B00701QVVY|5.0|Never bought an Overkill album but I knew they were thrash masters. And holy smokes this album is terrific. Its pretty much on repeat. Love it.
0525952926|5.0|This was an eye opening look at the world of yesterday coming to life again in todays world.  It is a very thought provoking book.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I like J. Depp and rented this to see it.  Wasn't a big fan of Dark Shadows so that may have not helped my rating.  I did enjoy it and laughed too.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was really good, quite the bit more exciting that the movie. Something some Harry Potter fans might like.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|My opinion is probably biased.  I loved this cd, the music was fantastic, Mr. Stewart is such a wonderful musician, and personality, with great stage presence, that I love everything he does w/music.  This Christmas album does not disappoint!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was an ok book. But not one of Jeff Kinneys greatest book.i liked his earlier books the most of the series
B008476HBM|5.0|I would be shocked if anyone reading this had never heard of the book before or seen any of the many movies about it, but just in case this is one of the best love stories ever written.  An absolute must read.  There are some unfamiliar words but if you have a dictionary you should be fine.  It is wonderful!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Consistently hilarious no matter how many times I have seen it. This year my 7- and 5-year old boys really got into it.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Excellent movie all around. The acting, directing, special effects, etc... all around amazing. It is a great way to start the trilogy. The DVD arrived in great condition and timely.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I purchased this cover to protect my Kindle and for the fact it converts into the stand. My cover is fraying on the front and it doesnt hold up the kindle properly. It falls and you have to readjust it. I am disappointed that is is falling apart, yes I do use my kindle alot, but I have only had it for less than a month and it looks horrible. I wouldn't recommend.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Surprisingly cute, and loves the hilarious fat Amy. A good fun movie for laughs. Highly recommend for family entertainment on the weekend
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am captivated. I have laughed, cried, mourned greatly but mostly enjoyed this book. The best thing about the Hunger Games is that that characters have depth and life and they exist in a special realm of literature. You feel for the characters and find you are able to relate to them in some way. It is very rare for an author to give such life to characters and the Hunger Games is one of the best written series in a long time.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Somewhat long .. Be prepared, but a good follow up to the series. I liked the movie, and the plot twists were entertaining just wish the story developed faster. Bale is a good batman, follow up characters minus robin leave a lot to be desired .
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am done with you Suzanne Collins, you have ruined my life with you amazingly written series. I have laughed, cried, mourned greatly but mostly enjoyed these books. The best thing about the Hunger Games Trilogy is that that characters have depth and life and they exist in a special realm of literature. It is very rare for an author to give such life to characters and the Hunger Games is one of the best written series in a long time.
0345534379|1.0|This product is black and white, paperback... not the hardback, color version. It came up in a search for the hard back when I clicked &#34;other buying options&#34;.  Oh well.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|Classic and amazing. I have read this about three times already and still enjoy every minute of it although the hints of homosexuality kind of through me off.
B000SC245E|5.0|Works as described. I have used it for more than 5 months, and I havent had a problem at all.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Okay book number two of the Hunger Games. Well First off I still find Katniss annoying, second Suzanne Collins what have you done!?!?!?! Third these books are amazingly well written but also disturbing.
B003L77GH4|5.0|again bought for my daughter for christmas she enjoyed it greatly, watches it frequently, is the beauty of owning your own copy, so you can watch when you want
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|I really like the concept and how it's a brother sister hero duo thing and not I'm an idiot teenage girl in love with some supernatural pale boy with gelled up hair. I am a huge fan of Alchemy and Nicholas Flamel so this book was an enjoyable read and I'd recommend it.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is classy, yet rugged/  I've used it over a year and it still looks great while protecting my kindle from all sorts of damage.  It looks like a leather bound book on the outside, but inside holds the kindle securely.  I am really impressed with how little it is wearing one year after purchase, considering how much my kindle gets used.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|First off the game was fun until I started getting messages about an update which was not true. LPS is a good game but be warned it will have a screen that says fake home screen that pops up when you start the game. It was fun while it lasted for me and my 12 year old.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Have to admit I couldn't really get into it at first. I'm glad I stuck with it. Great story! Loved it!
B00005NGAK|5.0|I even liked it better than riverdance and it has in depth interview with the LORD nd of course he is obsessed with himself.. but I might be too if I brought myself up from where he did, with the power of his mind.  LOTS of people have talent, but they don't do what he did, his drive is what accomplished these things, and I found the part exlaining all that interesting. some might not.
B009CPES4I|3.0|It was a little slow, but I can see how a senior citizen or older person would really enjoy this movie.
B001NKI60W|5.0|if you like  Abba.  yes, if not ...NO.  I happen to.. also if you like Meryl Streep, you will be astonished at what she can do.  I don't think... she used stunt doubles.<br />I didn't like the casting of Pierce Brosnan but he grew on me ( after seeing the movie several times)  A FEEL GOOD MOVIE<br />I  Have seen this movie so many times I have lost count. If I could give it 6 stars for enjoyment, I would. now, Aug 2013, I  am watching it again, as I write this review... with the same enjoyment as the first time... and think it is time to buy it.  she is absolutely unbelievable. What a feel good movie.... jeez..I'm watching her sing her heart out and run. ..up lots of steps to the top of a Greek hill.... and being the same age, I can't even believe my eyes.<br />A HUGE WONDERFUL Addition to the movie.....The casting of Meryl Streep's two child hood friends?  they are BOTH BRILLIANT.  FABULOUS<br /><br />Visually shockingly captivating, this movie should be appreciated on a big screen if possible.
B00015YVD6|5.0|A wonderful movie from the 80's. One of the best movies directed by Ron Howard besides &#34;Night Shift&#34;. Great Chemistry between Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah!
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|and it is a LONG C.D. But a few screamy tunes.  I think this is the one with all the words in a little booklet.  aside from the fact that I cant read the print (!) I like this touch and think more should do it.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|Bought brand new as a gift for a relative, and item arrived on time in new condition.  Haven't seen movie, so I can't comment on that.
B007HO392S|4.0|and I do like that she is able to cross over.  a few of them, esp The first song Blown away is catchy
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Love this movie!  Was pleased to add the CD version to my library since the VHS tape has been worn out from playing.  Video arrived in excellent condition and prior to the promised delivery date.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|I can not get enough of the movies made in the 80's. This was one of my favorites movies from that decade.
B004U8VWIM|1.0|I thought I would like this movie but it was just craziness. The actual story could have been really good with just the obsession to be the best and all of the drama that comes with it. But I think it got lost in too many unnecessary, distracting details. In the end there was no redeeming value to balance out all of the sick, twisted story lines.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book was well written and I enjoyed it. Very good read, didn't want to put it down. I finished it in three sittings. It had a great love story with a cliff hanger that makes you curious what will happen to the two main characters. Fairytale romance.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked the set up and thought the story was easy to relate to in most parts. I would recommend it to everyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, smile, and think about a lot of things. It was so innocent and different. I love it so much I would recommend it to anybody!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app to download, I read my daily scriptures and verses. In this crazy world we all need to have Jesus at our fingertips
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! I love that I can have it on my ipad, my kindle, my phone, and my computer! And they all sync!  Works great and really helps keep my &quot;lists&quot; organized!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|honestly I have never played with this app, my sister downloaded this and plays everytime I go to her house with my kindle so I guess its safe to say the app is pretty cool
B008OQRULO|5.0|I am 24 and my 15 year old cousin raves about this show and forced me to watch it on Netflix. I thought it would be juvenile. I am so glad that I did! I watched the first two seasons on Netflix and knowing that season 3 was about to pick up with the winter premiere I knew I had to get season 3 somehow. I am so thankful that I found out about Amazon Instant Video which is giving me the opportunity to watch it. It is well worth the money! I am IN LOVE with this show! There is always a twist and I love that. I used to say I was never going to watch an ABC Family show after not being able to get into The Secret Life of the American Teenager but good job ABC Family on Pretty Little Liars!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this calculator is one of the best I have seen for a tablet. I recommend this app for all with a tablet
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|This show was horrifying and mind blowing every penny spent on this dvd was well spent, straight of the bat from the first episode you get sucked in and will never want to stop watching. With every twist and turn you will hold on for dear life and never let go. Two thumbs way up.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|this is a great weather app, I needed to know the temp in the Bahamas for a certain weekend and was able to get the temp for the whole week
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once again I have been carried away to a land and time that continue to intrigue and captivate me. When is the next book due? Hurry Suzanne Collins and share the uprising.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I just downloaded this game yesterday and I can't seem to put it down. I find myself fighting with my twin 3 yr olds because they want to play too!  Great game and great app
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I thought it would be much better based on the reviews in Rotten Tomatoes.  None of the characters were truly likeable.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|there is really nothing special about this app, facebook is facebook. I recommend if you are a fan of facebook.
B00A14SQBU|4.0|First let me say I love me some Ms Christina! I thought as a whole the album was ok. I tend to like Christina more when her songs are more soulful and vulnerable, like If you lift me up or You lost me, I didn't get this on this album. It has some nice songs but to me the closets gem was her duet with Blake Shelton. I got this for a steal since it was $5 so I can't complain.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely heart wrenching. When Prim died, I nearly cried! This is my second time reading the book and it gets better every time.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I'm so hooked on this series. I was worried with the passing of Andy how Spartacus would do but Liam does such a great job. He really does make it his own and is a very believable leader of a Rebellion. It's as packed with action, drama and sex as the first season. Can't wait for the final season.
B00280LYIM|5.0|AH i love this book, it is the best one yet!!!!!! you need to read it all the way thru (:
B004QOB8SY|5.0|As fantastic as season 1! Only bad thing is having to wait so long in between seasons for new ones to come out!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Nothing too deep.  Just a fun read.  No great philosophy or deep thinking required, but fun to think through the survival problems with Watney.
0385535147|5.0|Never disappointed with Grisham's character development as the story unfolds.  Characters are relatable.  Setting is vivid and realistic.  Glad his writing inspires others to read.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|We watched this move via Amazon streaming and the video kept getting pixelated and the audio cut in an out. It made it hard to watch the movie.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Love this movie!  So much so I bought it on Blu-ray.<br />If you are a fan of Firefly or Joss Whedon (Director of, ahem...  Avengers!) this is a must have.
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy this game so much.  I feel like I'm actually running with something behind me.  Very cool! I really like his game. :-)
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Good movie, great action scenes. Loved the Cat Woman Character. Looking forward to another Batman movie, with Robin, Batman and Cat Woman.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Looks like a great story line.  Graphics are good.  I have always enjoyed Alawar games.  Looking forward to the gaming.  Bring it on.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Quirky and romantic in a very clean, non-sexual, way. It almost (but only almost) made me miss being a tween.
B004G600A4|5.0|The kids watch it over and over and over.  They just love this movie so much. you should get it.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I must be a baby :)  I enjoy this movie, even though I cry at times while watching it.  I  enjoy the music--especially the songs--Evergreen & With One More Look At You/Watch Closely Now.<br />I have never seen the A Star Is Born movies w/Judy Garland or w/Janet Gaynor.  I should try and rent them.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I originally started reading Gillian Flynn because they were based out of the good ole Show Me State and that is my home....pleasantly surprised to have read all three books and she is a brilliant writer with unbelievable stories to tell.  I have not been disappointed yet and look forward to be a fan for life and reading more books by my fellow Missourians.
B009DKFSUA|4.0|Although this CD is not as good as Planet Pit it still has some good songs in it. Love Pitbull.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. I own 3 kindles and I have this game on all 3!! It keeps you busy if your waiting for something
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a heartfelt book. It dealt with disturbing issues but came out on the other side. Sky and Holder could truly be your next door neighbors. This book shows grit, heart, and perserverance. Colleen Hoover did a spectacular job. I would like to see a follow up story of Holder and Sky. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|It's the summer of 1944. England has had enough of war. The atmosphere is tense and bottled up. Denizens of the city are frustrated with food rationing. They spread margarine thinly on a slice of bread but they dream of meat when there is none. Characters bicycle around because they don't have petrol to operate cars. They engage in one-night stands because of gas bombs overhead dropped by German planes. And it's only to be expected in this explosive atmosphere if sex is combine with  more than a little violence.<br />by Linda Cargill, author of Key to Lawrence
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Total Recall (2012) was entertaining and fast-paced. It paid homage to the Arnold Schwarzenegger version but changed some key elements (setting, leader of the resistance, etc.). All in all, it was a good flick.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This a great Movie. Hands down the greatest trilogy of all-time. It is a must own on DVD. Bought this for a gift. Great Seller and Item came New and Sealed.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Could not stop reading the trilogy. Makes you really think about where we're going as the human race, hopefully away from the hunger.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent calculator for the Kindle Fire. Easy to use, looks great, easy to see and has all the functionality necessary for a portable unit. I have never had a problem with this app.
B001SKB1Y0|2.0|While the movie was okay, I may have found it more enjoyable had the video streaming been more reliable.  I was on a hard line connection with high transfer rates, and the video and audio continually were not in-sync, which likely made my opinion of the movie less interesting.<br /><br />This is not the first time I've been disappointed with a streaming movie from Amazon, and the irony of this was that this particular movie was provided as a Customer service gift for &#34;loyalty&#34;.  Not sure how loyal I can stay to the streaming video aspect of Prime Services, but I'm hoping they can do something to fix this problem if it is an ongoing issue for other customers as well.
B004MC0FO8|1.0|it wont let me do any music ever time i try to get my kindle to do music it reads a message that doesnt make any sense
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very nice app. I have no problems with it. It is far away from the Pc version in the sense that you can't craft as much, but other than that it's my favorite app. Get it! You wont be disappointed! :)
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Requires brain power. Wish it were longer, only 3 chapters. Glad I had a discount card to purchase. Was still tons of fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I highly recommended reading it. I am an avid reader, most stories are predictable to me. There was no way I could predict anything that happened in this book. Colleen Hoover has impeccable writing skills. By far the best book I've ever read. I laughed, cried, and gasped. I've never felt so in tune with characters before. Will most definitely be reading more books by Colleen Hoover!!!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I have been reading romance books for decades. I love romance novels, but they are not all created equal. This one is a cut above. The hero and heroine resonate with depth. The author convinces the reader that they are two halves of one whole. She defines them well and doesn't stray from her characters, yet they never seem forced. I read the first half of the book voraciously, then found myself slowing down to savor it and draw it out. This was my introduction to this author. She is good and I will definately read more of her work. Treat yourself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wanted a game that both my husband and I would play.  Great visuals and met my expectations.  Recommend to others.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|yes! I got this game. I've been waiting all my life for this. I just downloaded it, and I know its gonna be AWESOME and kook - with a - k.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|&#34;Loved it, a lot better than the ps 2 version, whole lot of extra content, and well worth the price. I recommend this game to anyone who is a JRPG fan, or PERSONA fan.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I like the color and I hope it will protect my Kindle Fire if it's dropped, because of the padding inside.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|My husband watched the series but could not always see it each week so we got him the set for Christmas
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie was fantastic. When it comes to action films, this one is ranked fairly high with me. It follows a classic pattern of unjustifiable violence with little or no plot or acting. A great thing to eat wings and drink beer to.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she really loves it. She had seen it at the movies and wanted her own.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Not quite as explosive as the first one but makes up for it with a little more character. It did get a bit cheesy though which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I understand the reason they put the cheese in but I think they may have put a bit too much in. Still totally worth the watch for my fellow action movie buffs.
B002ZG999U|5.0|My son got both Expendables for Christmas and he really likes them. He had already seen it at the movies with his Dad and wanted his own copy
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I saw a piece on this person on 60 minutes. He is very humble and has a talent few have appreciated. I hope more hear his talent.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|My son loves this movies. He and his father had seen it at the movies and wanted his own for Christmas.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|I bought this as a gift, and have never watched it. So I chose a neutral rating. The person who received it as a gift loved it though.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My husband started watching this show an loved it but because of his part time job could not always watch it every week so he is thrilled to have the set
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|The graphics are horrible. And ALSO A COPY OF MINE CRAFT XBOX EDITION DON'T BUY IT. BUY MINE CRAFT POCKET EDITION IT IS BETTER.
0345410025|5.0|This book was recommended to me by one of my students who has been using it religiously due to an accident that left her with significant memory problems. I expect to integrate some of its ideas into my course structure.
B005LAII0I|2.0|The Magic of the story is not found in this version. Full of old punch lines.  It departs from the original story in an unoriginal fashion and takes a leave for a seemingly political twist to turn a focus on taxes. Not Julia Roberts best performance.  Disappointing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyed it. Bummer the free version was so short. Don't think I'll pay $2.99 to continue though. It seems too much for this game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am enjoying this interesting time travel!  I like reading on my Kindle Fire, since I can make the print bigger for these old eyes!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very creative game! Thank you for making it the free app of the day on New Years Eve......but it would have been well worth the regular price of $1.99
B0083Z614S|5.0|Best book ever great read. This is a classic and may be one of the best books ever. You will not be able to put it down.
B000V39KDO|4.0|Overall, it was a great film! It was a treat for a New Year's Eve party with close family and friends!
B0030E1XJU|4.0|We bought this one last year 2011 and gave it to my son for 2012 Christmas.  I was glad I waited because it is a bit complicated but he really likes it.  It takes a few min to set up (fit the right pegs in the right holes) once you get it all set up its fun.  My son really likes the rope swing part.  It goes well with the set and a very nice addition.  If you were to only purchase one i would recommend this one because it basically has 3 pieces.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are many different versions to choose from.  I really like the English Contemporary Version, which is very easy to understand.  This app is also very easy to use and works well.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Loved the movie and the soundtrack! I wish more songs had been included, but I realize it's just the highlights.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really fun for all ages it's like having your own little garden of cute little Ponys! ^_^ Me and my best friends love it ^_^
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Free at first, payed 2.99 about halfway through, totally worth it. Great story, graphics, and puzzles. Need to make more! 5 stars.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Plenty of action.  Keep the kids entertained from start to finish.  I would add this to my collection. I liked this as much as the Ironman movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book<br />Loved it is a book every one should read it! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0086700CM|5.0|Highy addictive!  Fun for the whole family ... pass a few minutes in line, get yourself through commercials during the game.  Fun for many ages ...
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very well written and I had to keep readiing through the book.  I was hoping to get through the book in 4-5 days; it took 2.5 days!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game!  My husband and I think the graphics remind us of 1980 and the original space invaders game, but it was purchased for my 8 year old - and he said it is a MUST PLAY!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Didn't watch more than 2 minutes to decide I didn't want to waste my time.  Didn't think the throwing up on stage scene in the first few minutes provided me with more incentive to watch.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My Grandsons loved this case.  Wish I had ordered of them.  It makes into the neatest little zippered case. that they can fill with legos and carry around.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved the humor in this movie.  One of the most clever animated movies I've seen.  Love it, love it and bought it for really cheap!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Book was as expected. Descent, but the poor editing is an annoyance you have to read around. I would recommend
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A very like able movie with Clint playing the role of an old man made grumpy by the circumstances of life. Appropriate for young teens and older. Enjoy!
B0037VNX44|5.0|Awesome movie!  A friend recommended this movie and I was not disappointed; however, it is violent so please keep that in mind.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Excellent read. Lincoln was smart enough to know that the cival war was not enough to end slavery. Ms Goodwin spells it out in detail how slavery was made to be against the law. Please take the time to read this. Lincoln they don't make Republicans like that anymore!
B00846REIS|4.0|Having read the \\"Gray Trilogy\\", I was a bit hesitant to read another book that might be similar. I was surprised this book was SO much better of a read than the Gray series. It wasn't as intense and there was actually a story/ plot with this book which I found to be much more interesting than the sex scenes. I'm looking forward to reading the next ones.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The only complaint I have is that this book left you wanting more.  It definitely lived up to my expectations.  Some other reviewers thought Katniss was whiney or they thought there was too much time describing her clothes or other things.  I disagree.  I thought the book had a great balance of description, character development and emotion.  I enjoyed immensely.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app is great! It has everything you would want to know about the weather and more.<br />Easy to look at graphics and a very useable GUI.<br />If you're looking for a weather app, I would definitely recommend this one!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Dylan seems set to wind down his career just as it started...with several strong albums. Starting with \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" (his first album was good but really, the Dylan we know came to fruition starting on TFBD) he capped off an amazing six album cycle with \\"Blonde On Blonde\\". Starting with \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" he creates a strong six album journey topped off by what I would consider as strong an album as \\"Blonde On Blonde\\". Don't get me wrong, it's not another BOB, they're as different as 46 years could make them but \\"Tempest\\" stands on it's own as a great piece of Dylan music.
B008AU7F3C|4.0|THIS IS A NEW ARTIST TO MY REPETOIRE...............LOVED THE PREVIEW....DEFINATELY AN ARTIST TO LOOK OUT FOR!!! MOOD PROVOKING......MELLOW BUT UPBEAT AT THE SAME TIME!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book. I'm not a reader but finished it in one day. Can't wait to read the other books in the series.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|LISTENED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO &#34;CLAP YOUR HANDS&#34; AND WAS HOOKED FROM THE ONSET........ABSOLUTELY LOVE SIA'S QUERRKY STYLE.......COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was everything, romantic, mysterious and erotic all in one fantasy. Notonce did I find myself skimming through the pages, but savoring each one to see what happens next.
B008LBX7DC|5.0|THIS ALBUM CONTAINS SOME GREAT HITS.........I WILL DEFINATELY NOT TIRE OF LISTENING TO IT.......COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! GETS THE BLOOD PUMPING......
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I loved the original movie, but I think after....what? Three or four iterations, they're desperate to come up with plot lines. I think the squirrel and nut thing should be retired...as a sideline joke, it's fine, but for the basic premise of the movie? Meh. Whatever. It must be said, however, that the kids LOVED it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read. The story is so well written. It wasn't rushed or dragged out. It was put together so perfectly. There is so much emotion when reading this book. It's a book that I find myself thinking about before falling asleep and daydreaming about.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Omg I absolutely love this book! The new one better be released soon! Rick Riordan is a genius! I wanna be a demigod now!
B004G6009U|5.0|-A well put together cartoon<br />-Songs are very catchy<br />-Keeps kids attention AND adults<br />-It has a good story line<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to any family
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Since I have read this book, I often think about it. It was very clever and rivetting right to the end
0316113077|5.0|This was part of my grand-daughters Christmas present and she loved it.  Great ideas and wonderful pictures.  I can't wait to see the products.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love to draw. This is by far the most  entertaining app Eva. What a blast.  A+, shout out to devs. Thanks a mil for all the fun.
B008J34466|5.0|Great music by pink and songs you can relate too ....I enjoyed her full album and got my moneys worth.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is the Ultimate set for the Sound of Music fan. It has it all! I can not wait to share the music of this timeless treasure with my family.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I rarely listen to a full album b/c sometimes I don't like the other songs but I was able to enjoy the full album : ). I got my moneys worth for this one.
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|I bought this movie for my dad for Christmas. Will Smith is awesome and the movie has lots of laughs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was crazy good and had so many twists and turns that you would never expect to see coming.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad. He loved it! Definitely a great value for what I paid
B00133KFGW|5.0|One of best films ever - in our AAAAA list.  Genuine happy feel, tears,  gut wrenching, sweet, romanntic - just beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Awesome movie!! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are hysterical. The cameo by Johnny Depp was great too. Definitely a movie you need to see.
0812993292|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Many of the characters that Harold meets have no real point.  I kept waiting for the situation to improve for Harold and it just kept getting worse.  I read at least 35 books per year and and this was one of my least favorite.  In a word - depressing.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I chose 3 stars because there were some words that I needed that were in there and some that I needed wernt in there. But overall, it helped me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not stop reading-- it kept me at the edge of my seat.  Very suspenseful.  Almost wished there was something to follow but the ending was perfect
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie and every time I watch it I see something new I had missed before. It's just a cool story about how these orphan girls transform a villain into a nice guy. The added bonus are the minions and I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why some fast food place has not picked up on the franchise for this movie. They would make adorable toys in kids' meals. Well worth the viewing.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Fun with cool musical themed CD cover, bonus song. Almost perfect.And of course, Lyrics for all of the songs! Worth it.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Good movie with interesting characters.  Enjoyed it and the plot.  It is definitely a movie that I can recommend to family and friends.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We just watched this movie a few days ago and one thing is for certain, this is my new favorite animated movie of all time.<br /><br />It was so nice to see new charcters, The Sandman was an amazing stroke of imagination. The Easter Bunny played by Hugh Jackman with his real Aussie accent was amazingly funny.<br /><br />The second you see Jack Frost your heart melts for him and you fall head over heels in love with this enchanting young boy voiced by Chris Pine.<br /><br />Santa was great as well as the Tooth Fairy and her little helpers.<br /><br />There was nothing in this movie I wasn't in awe with. The little girl and her strewn about hair seemed so REAL!!!!<br /><br />I believe it was Dreamworks, right? They hit it out of the ball park with this one and into the bay (think Giants stadium, lol)<br /><br />I am preordering it so we can watch it the day it comes out.<br /><br />MUST BUY!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Great little game, snagged it while free and may be worth a .99 but no more. It could stand to be longer too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Reading this book I had to become a filter and not a sponge and read the book well just like Charlie reads. Truly an inspiring story about coming of age and  all the ups and downs along with the amazing people and memories you have along the way. Charlie had me see the perks of being a wallflower and Sam and Patrick showed true friendship an  added beautiful depth to the book. A must read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have thought about reading this for a while now. Since I heard all the hype I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about.  I'm so glad I decided to read the first one.  Of course then I couldn't put my kindle down!  I read all three books in two days.  Could not put it down!! So glad I found out what all the hype is about!  Loved the characters. You get really attached to them all!  Will read anything EJ James writes from now on.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I thought this book was captivating. It captures the strength of a mother and child's bond to overcome the presence of evil.
B003KUSUN6|4.0|[[ASIN:B00001P4ZH Koss PortaPro Headphones with Case]]When I demonstrate a real good sounding concert that only \\"Blu-ray\\" can produce, this is one of them. I learned to play guitar with music like this. Its too bad there is not one of \\"the Ventures\\" that sounds like this for the style is the same.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book. I had to keep reminding myself this was a nonfiction account of nailing UBL. I have read most all Tom Clancy novels and \\"No Easy Day\\" ranks right up there!

1594487154|4.0|As he has in his previous books, Dan Pink takes an important topic (sales), hones in on some of the social science behind it, and then offers an entertaining mix of stories, examples, and research findings to illuminate his primary assertion.  In To Sell is Human that point is an obvious, but very important one: regardless of your title, you work in sales.<br /><br />It is a breezy read filled with a diverse mix of examples and insights that offer a little something for everyone.  That's both the book's strength and it's one potential shortcoming: it's a little something for everyone.  It offers great hors d'oeuvre size portions of useful information, but if you're looking for a filling entree for any one aspect of this topic, you'll be left a little hungry.  As someone who consumes 50-75 business books annually, I am not the typical reader.  So at times the content seemed a bit formulaic to me (turning ABC into attunement, buoyancy, and clarity felt a bit of a stretch and the exercises at the end of each chapter sometimes seemed less purposeful than what might be possible).<br /><br />That said the book remains a critical primer for those who resist seeing themselves in the work of sales.  If I was a middle manager, I would definitely use it as a professional development discussion catalyst with the people I supervise.  And it left me (someone who hadn't always had the most positive connotation of a salesman) pondering this: if To Sell is Human, how do I bring more of my humanness into any sales efforts in which I engage?  That enduring question alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Note:  I received an advance galley proof of the book to facilitate providing this early review.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like games like this. I had to buy the full version to get through the game. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it didn't take but just a few hours to complete it.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Sometimes it takes a film about the environmental crises to bring to the attention of the entire populace that not only MUST we do something about our bruising of our natural environment, but that when certain people take action it does indeed make a difference. This is a gently made film that gets its point across in a warmly entertaining way - and it is a true story!<br /><br />Thomas Rose' book FREEING THE WHALES forms the basis for this story, adapted for the screen by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler.  Ken Kwapis directs. In brief summery (everyone knows this story by now), an animal-loving volunteer and a small-town news reporter are joined by a native Alaskan boy to rally an entire community - and eventually rival world superpowers - to save a family of majestic gray whales trapped by rapidly forming ice in the Arctic Circle.'<br /><br />The cast is a large one with some actors only appearing briefly but in roles that show their professional an also their emotional support for placing this subject before the public. In the lead roles are John Krasinski, Drew Barrymore, Ted Danson and Tim Blake Nelson, but the remainder of the cast includes Dermot Mulroney, Kathy Baker, Kristin Bell, James LeGros and a fine supporting cast of Inuit actors and others.<br /><br />The special effects are credible and deeply moving as the whales are released form their frozen captivity.  The film adds much to the understanding of environmental problems and how multinational efforts are necessary to tame the destructive threats to the future of our globe.  Grady Harp, January 13
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game is a must have! I spent too much time with it in a good way, a lot cheaper than buying a handheld game if you know what I'm saying
B005LAII8A|3.0|LOOPER did fairly well in the box office in October 2012 and now that it is available on Instant Video and in DVD the popularity grows. Written and directed by Rian Johnson it is another take on the concept of time travel (a topic that never seems to miss with audiences) and while the film is entertaining, it is very bloody and gory and the only salvation is the fact that the cast contains some of filmdom's more popular actors.<br /><br />The story is best summarized by the lead character in the film, Joe played with skill (despite phony makeup trying to make him resemble Bruce Willis - his looper self) by Joseph Gordon-Levitt: `I work as a specialized assassin, in an outfit called the Loopers. When my organization from the future wants someone to die, they zap them back to me and I eliminate the target from the future. The only rule is: never let your target escape... even if your target is you.'<br /><br />Or, stated another way, in 2074, when the mob wants to get rid of someone, the target is sent 30 years into the past, where a hired gun awaits. Someone like Joe, who one day learns the mob wants to 'close the loop' by transporting back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis). So the film opens in the year 2044, and Joe is a looper, friends with Seth (Paul Dano in a very brief appearance) and lovers with Suzie (Piper Perabo) and working for head looper Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe discovers his next assignment is himself (Bruce Willis, Joe from the future).  He also encounters Sara (Emily Blunt) who knows the strange coincidences that are about to happen (!) and mothers a child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has particularly useful end-of-the -world powers etc etc.<br /><br />It is a clever idea and if time travel and assassinations fascinate you, then this is a well-made move in that genre. Grady Harp, January 13
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So many great points in this book! It's a story well told & it will definitely open your eyes a little wider!!!
0399160450|4.0|A little long, but with short chapters and almost double spacing, it is an easy read.  As usual with Clancy, it is very timely: cyber war and Chinese claims to the South China Sea.  Lots of computer jargon and technical details but they don't really bog down the average reader.
0525423656|3.0|Huh?!?! You can't end it like that!!!!!!!<br /><br />Okay, so the entire 1st book, I'm yelling at Cassia to stop looking at Ky and remember Xander!!!<br /><br />This book, I want to slap her a few times... Why must she look for Ky? I want to believe it's more out of guilt than love, as she tells herself...<br /><br />Xander Fans will be disappointed and yelling at Cassia, like I did, but as I now read book 3, I understand why certain things had to happen.... But ended so abruptly! I was lucky book 3 was available to keep going.<br /><br />This isn't as good as the 1st or 3rd books, but you'll need to read it to finish the series.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I guess after the last movie, I expected more. I mean, even by comic book standards, this movie didn't make a lot of sense and took a long time to get there.
0385732554|5.0|The cover always kept me from reading this book. But my 7th grader came home with it, so I read it. I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />A friend tells me there are additional books in a series - need to check these out...<br /><br />It was a fast read, so it won't take too much of your time, either.  ENJOY!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I listen to this CD in the car all the time.  Their gritty English Folk Rock style is unique and can't wait to purchase Babel, their next album.
1452111014|5.0|No problems with purchase and the book came in great shape. Good people to deal with, and I like I said, grandkids loved it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen hoover delivers a great read! Each Character was well developed and kept my attention through out the book.  I couldn't put it down.  This book is easily one of my favorites of the year.  Buy it now!  :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book finished off the series believably.  I like her way of telling a story and will try her other books.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have had this app on every phone I've had and now on my kindle fire hd and I have never had any issues with it. I love it. I syncs my data with my phone and my tablet so I don't have to worry about data being lost. Awesome app
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Excellent action movie; best of the Dark Knight series.  Despite its length, I did not notice the time while watching.  The action and story line kept me going well enough.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game i do reccommend you people reading this to get the game.  heres a seed you should try its called (ghosts of onyx 2) and i know ghosts of onyx is the name of a halo book by eric nylund but the seed is great ps when you enter the seed and your facing a huge vast of water swim all the way to the left corner and youll find some iron orebps digging and you find one more piece of iron ore and some coal. thank you for reading this  ps like if your homie knight to slyfoxhound  and i meant to say silver not iron  peace homies
0375413405|5.0|The book is actually really, really good for getting to know the basics of french cooking, and then using lots of variations to make new dishes interesting. I used this book to learn the basics (like not cooking everything on high heat because it will cook faster) and to take time with dishes. I no longer constantly burn the onions and chicken
B0094KTCCY|5.0|Our kids love this movie, and my wife and I do too!  It has comedy, great songs, and is just a fun time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a story that jumps from the perspective of one character in the beginning to another character in the second part.  It keeps you guessing as to which character is the &#34;good guy&#34;.  I loved the story right up until the end.  When I finished the book, I kept thinking there should have been a different ending.  It took me days to realize that no other ending would truly fit.  What happens to the character and their outcome is exactly what they deserved.  Really great story!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I simply don't think that after the initial learning the game and the rules that it is worth my time.
B0026772N8|5.0|A very unique examination of life and its meaning. Also, Pirsig nails the visceral experience of the open road on a bike.
B0063IH60K|4.0|As with all solitare games, I like it.  It is a great way to play a quick game and enjoy it.
B009329Y30|5.0|I love this movie. The acting is not perfect but the theme is. I can't wait to be able to watch it at home.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the game, I have played it for years so it is not new to me.  i would recommend it to all solitare lovers.
0345529057|5.0|My son loves to read fantasy books. This power packed combo, will keep him engrossed for a couple days. Oh yea, the bang for my buck was also positive. And great service.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love any and all mahjong games.  There are many other different mahjong games that I play as well. All of these games are similiar in rules and purpose.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I was very surprised by this game. It really delivers and I expected to breeze right though it. However, ive found the puzzles to be fairly challenging
B008MEM24S|3.0|I cant understand why apple has had new levels since October but nothing for my kindle fire....plz fix this I'm very upset that I payed for a kindle and now amazon has put us on the back burner
B009R8DJ72|5.0|i liked the book very much. it was interesting and fun to read. i hope jeff kinney writes more on diary of a wimpy kid
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I can't wait for the third book to come out! My sister-in- law recommended this book to me because I like books like Twilight, Hunger Games, 50 Shades of Gray and Succubus Blues.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said, it's a brilliant film with a skilled cast and director. It takes comic book films to the level of true art. Bane beat Batman with words before he even threw a punch. Not quite as good as TDK's Joker, but Bane was definitely a force Batman wasn't ready for.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Could not put it down. Much to my wife's chagrin. Put it on new Android I got for Christmas. She wanted to read the news.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Great insight into the world of our USA Presidents.<br />Authors gave great facts about both our current Presidente' and members of the Ex-President's Club,<br />Excellent book. Well written<br />Quality service from seller. 5 stars all way around Highly recommend<br />Read via Kindle...if you don't have a Kindle....what are you waiting on? Great way to purchase and read books
1476715904|5.0|I love this book, the story really tugged at my heart strings..... I was crying a good portion of this book. I really enjoyed the story for both the main characters it brought the whole love story together. Amazing writing, excited to read the next book.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|I loved this app on my phone and was bummed that kindle fire hd does not have it in their app store. I was able to sideload it and it has been so awesome to be able to move photos, notes and almost every convenient item I used from my cell to my kindle fire hd. I would have rated it 5 stars if the kindle fire hd app store had it available.
B004KSQBEC|5.0|I bought these for my 12 year old son. He says they are comfortable and his socks stay dry after wearing them all day. They are easy to put on and have great grip. Would recommend to friends and family.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of two games I downloaded for my son (4yrs) to play for only short periods of time and once we tried it together for the first time, we became hooked. Lots of fun for a free game. Thanks Amazon!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, a solid thriller with a more personal twist. This was another enjoyable Flynn read. I would highly recommend it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Had this app on my phone and it has been my lifesaver when I need to keep various info on small notes. Its also an excellent shopping list. Had to have it on my kindle fire too and with the help of the dropbox app (not avail thru kindle fire app store) ive been able to move some important notes from my cell color notepad notes to my new kindle color notepad notes. Great app to keep you organized.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|it's ok, it's ok, It is not ok to be forced to typ 16 words for a review. . .
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This s a thriller, action movie. If you liked the Matrix trilogy and like futuristic films, you love Looper. Acting is excellent, too.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I don't like it, I don't like the fact I have to type 16 words for a review. . .
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Made me want you pick up the third book. Excellent continuation of the first book. Reads super fast ans I didn't want to put it down. If you like beautiful creatures beautiful darkness won't disappoint

B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is one of my all-time favorite card games and this version on my Kindle Fire makes it very easy to play!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|She delves so deep into reasoning and thought processes before actions. It keeps me reading steadily for hours. This is the second time I've read this book. The first took me about a week and a half, today I read 70% of this book today, 6 hours straight.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Lots of good action!!! And anticipation, never got bored during the whole development of the plot certainly a good story
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Granddaughters favorite! Love that she loves to read and had seen the movie and wanted to compare the book-not sure which was better
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose  thus rating because  I think I  is an every entertaining<br />book. I liked everything about the book. I would recommend this  book to elementary an  middle school students.
034580404X|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the books and observiing the power of love and its ability to change people for the better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|oh Hazel and Augustus, your love story was epic indeed.  When adults question the credibility and sincerity of a teenager's romantic love, we doubt because of bitterness and perhaps, being burned too many times in the past.  But we have much to learn from their way of falling in love without fear and without holding back.  That is, perhaps, how we should fall in love each and every time...as if it was the very first.  Thank you for reminding us, Hazel and Augustus.<br />I cried in 3 different parts of this book.  I had a hard time closing the book because I didn't want the story to end.  I got so attached to the characters.  yes, even van Houten.<br />This book is definitely in my TOP 5 books of all time - up there with The Kite Runner, Memoirs of a Geisha, 11/22/1963 and The Help.<br /><br />BRAVO, John Green!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Cannot wait to start Fifty Shades Freed.  Great study into the minds and emotions of what makes us tic.  When we care for another this book makes us aware of what we will do to make the relationship work.<br />Amc
B0083TXXZ4|1.0|The set up doesn't allow the pieces to be locked in, we bought 2 so I can say it wasn't just one defective product.  Avoid, there are plenty of others that are much better quality.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|awesome series, very gritty... some complaints i read about the quality of the the image on the television i think is because of the style they shot the series, not the actual dvd.
B009K0OL06|2.0|Story line is all right but I couldn't figure out how to show Closed Captions on the down loaded versions from Amazon.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|it's a wonderful movie, timeless inspiration to bring us back to reality in this present day 'instant' 'i want it now' generation... teaches good values, honesty in relationships, sacrifice of self for the needs of others which is so lacking today.  in those days needs came first and people were valued above getting ahead and material wants...  i would watch this movie even if it was not Christmas.  love it.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I love this CD!  Lovely, jazzy music, sung by a legend.  Bought several for Christmas gifts.  Paul McCartney never lets me down.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|Not easy to follow the fantastic first season, but this does well with the exception of a war-wounded &#34;family&#34; member showing up and buggering things up.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|This is a great animation quality.  Its a nice story.  My husbands from Europe and he remember Tin Tin as a child.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Great product, works well with yawcam and my HD web cam.  Easy to set up!  Great buy!  I use it to make sure my pup isn't causing trouble when I go out.  Works on wifi on my phone and 3G too---
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got these for my wife for Christmas to have for a rainy day. Hasn't rained yet so I haven't opened them yet.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|White Noise creates an environment of sound that soothes you to sleep.<br /><br />Pros: An excellent collection of sounds to choose from with the ability to easily add more from the developer website. The timed turn off and alarm function make it an excellent travel companion. Add in a pillow speaker, and it's an excellent tool of compromise if your special someone doesn't like white noise.<br />Cons: There is no functionality to allow for playing multiple sounds simultaneously (that I have found). Depending on how you come down in the question, there are also no sub-audial noise options.
B004WR125O|2.0|Used for 10 months and it crapped out. Not worth the time or money to send back, got it for $20 something.  I ran a network cable to get internet radio. Not real impressed with this product, may have got a dud, but oh well, My Onkyo is a great receiver, just not so great on this adapter.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|i am very happy with this product...it is very clear and the quickness in which i received it in the mail was very good.  it even came fast during the chrtismas season
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I believe these actors did a good job of showing how a marriage can become stale and the risks necessary to add life back into it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great action, mystery, spy novel that keeps you turning the pages and returning for more of Mitch Rapp, Irene Kennedy and company.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm not finished with the book yet, but I can hardly put it down. This story has had so many unanticipated twists. It's a fun read.
0553381407|5.0|All my life I had beat myself up over my dysfunctional ways, overeating, overspending, being depressed. This book helped me to make sense of why and more importantly HOW to heal and move forward. The bad news is, that I had to have a lot of courage to read this book all the way through, because it made me have to deal with pain, anger and grief. Those are very painful.<br />This book has helped me to understand so much about myself, the people I grew up with as a child that were supposed to be \\"parents\\", and about life in general. There are plenty of case histories she shares within the book that made me understand that I wasn't the only one and that dysfunctional families are more common than most people are comfortable realizing. I recommend this book for anyone, whether or not you have toxic parents, because 9 times out of 10 there are people in your life who do come from toxic and dysfunctional families. This could be your spouse, your neighbor, your friends, your boss, coworkers, loved ones.... It was very painful and uncomfortable to read, and there were many times I had to put the book down for several days, because it was too much to deal with, but Dr. Susan Forward's compassion throughout the book drew me back in whenever I was ready and had integrated more of the pain work. No matter where you are in life at this time, there IS hope and you CAN heal from the past and enjoy a higher quality of life
1451629192|5.0|I will never complain about my life ever again! What an unbelievable story about courage and survival. The strength shown by Jaycee is amazing. Her life may have been stolen hopefully now it is beginning. It really opened my eyes to be on the lookout for other missing and exploited children. We must work harder to protect our children from such evil people.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game looks awesome on the Fire HD! I'm very old school and just now have stepped into the realm of HD when I purchased my daughter one for CHristmas. I found this app for free on Christmas. I wasn't sure what you actually do until I played the game. A Indiana Jones-y guy just runs through a temple trying to keep away from the bad guys. Pretty funny and keeps you on your toes. The clarity is more than great. Just wished that he did more than run but that would be another game.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|More chaotic than structured, more implausible than convincing, and its happy ending is welcome for its being gratifyingly final. What redeems the movie are the reliably solid performances of Judy Dench and Maggie Smith. Its other virtue is characterization; insights here and there into the variations and subtleties of that ubiquitous emotion we call love. I would recommend The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to the dedicated film buff. Others may want to take a pass.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free and addicting; what more could you want!? I got my 13yo a kindle fire for Christmas and needed some games and such. I came across this freebie and thought, &#34; Okay lets give it a whirl.&#34; I didn't realize that it would be one that she plays constantly. So glad I got this one.
B009JBZH54|4.0|The material the box is made of feels quite nice and not cheap. Also looks nice on my shelf of Blu-rays.  I'm not giving it a perfect 5-star rating because the way the little 'behind-the-scenes' booklet is shoved in beside the removable fold out box that contains all the discs is not very elegant.  I would have preferred one inner box that sits inside the outer shell nice and snug. Still, a great set of movies in pretty nice packaging.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was absolutely captivating. I simply could not put it down. Nicholas Sparks has done it again. His writing style just puts you right there with the characters. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|The first and last portions of the book are the most compelling. I felt as though the middle portion would never come to a conclusion. The format was difficult for me to become accustomed to as it is mostly compromised of journal and diary entries, newspaper clippings, and telegrams.<br /><br />That said, I do find it to be a worthwhile read as it is interesting to read the book that so much has been based upon since. The characters, although two-dimensional in some respects, provide interesting glimpses into the concepts and stereotypes of the time. The deep conviction shared by the main group of characters towards the accomplishment of a most important goal is compelling.<br /><br />Give yourself plenty of time to finish this as rushing through it will only lead to frustration due to the format used to tell the story.
B008602KQI|5.0|We saw this movie 4 times in the theaters and so had to have it when it came out on DVD.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book caught my attention from the very first sentence, and kept me intrigued to the very last word! I have recommended this book to everyone I talk to about books.
1609611543|5.0|I've read lots of reviews on this book.  There are a lot of people who complain that this is a re-packaged version of Atkins, or that it's another low-carb diet plan book.  That's not the case at all. Here's why: This book gives the scientific FACTS behind why we should give up wheat.  It's not saying, \\"YOU'LL LOSE WEIGHT IF YOU GIVE UP CARBS AND START EATING LOTS OF MEAT!!!\\" and leaving it at that.  This book gives you the facts (most of them, not all) about how our bodies process modern wheat.  It gives more evidence to back up why cutting out sugar, other grains, and some other high-glycemic foods is also a good idea.  There are more backed-by-science facts in this book than you will see in most other books, including The China Study.  The information in Wheat Belly may not be absolutely complete (that would take volumes), but it gives you what you need to know to continue further research.<br /><br />I really liked this book.  Although I read the Kindle version, it was a real \\"page-turner\\" for me.  I couldn't wait to find out what his conclusions were at the end, and see his recommendations.  I couldn't stop reading it.  I will admit that some of the science was a bit over my head- and I skimmed over some of the more hard-core science facts that didn't pertain to my situation (such as the big section on Celiac).  But there were a lot of modern references (some funny) as well as historical evidence to keep me reading it.  I had planned to just read a little bit here and there while I read my fiction books as my mainstay, but I ended up pouring over this book until it was finished.<br /><br />Do I take this book for gospel?  Nah.  No.  It was written by a human, and based on human research.  To err is human. I'm sure there are errors in this book.<br /><br />But you know what?  I've given up grains, and I've given up sugar.  And unlike my past \\"Atkins Diet\\", I don't feel like I'm on a diet for losing weight anymore.  I now feel that wheat really IS something thatSHOULD be given up.  There are so many facts to back that up.  And I feel GOOD now.  I haven't felt this good in a long time.  I'm still on a weight-loss journey, but I'm certainly not on a \\"diet\\".  I feel too good eating this way to ever want to feel sluggish and foggy like I did while eating wheat and other grains.  Now, if I eat bread, I get the most uncomfortable cramps imaginable.<br /><br />Here's the deal.  I've been vegetarian.  I've been vegan.  I've been on Atkins.  I've been on Weight Watchers.  I have NEVER felt as good as I do when I give up the sugar and the grains.  I miss pizza, spaghetti, sandwiches- those are the foods I used to love.  Cake, candy, pie?  Yep, I miss them.  But I only MENTALLY miss them now.  I no longer crave them.  I never feel hungry anymore.  I don't ever really NEED to eat, I just eat to fuel my body.  And as a recovering sugar/carb addict, that is saying a LOT.  I've wasted 35 years of my life feeling crappy.  This book has given me a fresh start- and a stubbornness to stick with it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Love, Love Love the read. Absolutely amazing to read. Very insiteful. I wanted more. I read on my way to work and back home. It kept me toned in.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|nice...need one for season one..if your a dead fan you need this for your collection. seller was great arrived as promised
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game even though it's different for people who haven't played when it first came out here's your chance of an opportunity this game just increases your creativity and math
B005FISC52|5.0|Pirchased for daughter as a gift and this brings her collection up to date, how can you go wrong? No problems noted.
B006MOW98E|4.0|I gave this book a 4 because.... it is so good!!!! I mean I love how the authors tied all the characters together from the Starbucks barista to the manager of a waffle house (you will understand after the last story). While reading this book I enjoy figuring out how each character played a role in this great book. Especially reading this book on a chilly January day it truly added to the holiday spirit.<br />\\"Let it snow\\" is the perfect name for this book.

B00936A0RU|4.0|This movie was filmed in part not far from where I live so I had an added interest in seeing it.It did not disappoint.We do not frequent the movies very much but after seeing it earlier in the year I awaited it's arrival on dvd.I would recommend this movie to friends.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|love this item. i have limited space in front of my tv. i have a 65 inch flat screen and a reg size couch against the oppiset wall in a room that is 18 feet wide. the kinect sets 2 feet off of the ground and is 10 full feet away from the couch. the kinect says it is best at 6ft or more away. i find that i have to be in the 8 to 10 area for it to pick me up well,especially on the ground. i was often told to move back when i was pressed up against the couch. with the zoom i can stand at 6 ft and it sees all of me and the floor below me. the reg kinect often cut my feet or head off at 6 ft, depending on how you aim it in the setup program. im 6 ft 2 in and it works great for me. my daughter also is picked up more acurately as well now which is another great side effect. she is about 3.5 ft tall and the reg kinect cant seem to follow her movements very well which frustrates her a lot. this is the way the kinect should come from the factory. i dont know a lot of people that have 15 ft clear in front of their tv.  i wouldnt own a kinect without this product, and its reasonably priced.
1908407204|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo5G2DF2UWHXBO]]<br />BUT SOME ARE MORE IN IT THAN OTHERS!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Steve Hynes has produced a highly charged political statement of where he perceives `justice' to be under the current Coalition Government's war on the deficit and he makes some very valid points in this review of the state of legal aid in 2012-2013 as the cuts bite.<br /><br />The Legal Action Group always produces excellent publications and `Austerity Justice' is no exception. Hynes has established his basic historic thesis that access to justice policy is now at one of its lowest ebbs with the arrival of the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012.  He describes the Act as leading to the tipping point between members of the coalition although the jury may still be out on this during 2013.<br /><br />`Austerity Justice' examines the `once and for all redesign' of the civil justice legal aid system by the government against substantial opposition where key concessions were won over including the ability to permit amendments to the scope of legal aid in the future.  However, it is doubted whether some of these measures are actually written in stone.<br /><br />We came away with the decided view that not everyone is `in this together' although the extent of the cuts could well lead to what is called a `rump service' in the future as the welfare state is transformed into a new design by the current government. To many there has been an urgent need for legal aid reform because of the ballooning budget.<br /><br />Therefore, this book is most thought-provoking and a valuable statement of what is currently on the table by way of reform - the debate is well under way although whether there is a `ratchet' effect with the terminal decline of legal aid remains to be seen as far as many are concerned.<br /><br />Steve Hynes offers us a genuine insight into the peaks and troughs of legal aid as the political philosophies have changed since 1949 but make no mistakes... for many this matter has not been finally decided!al aid as the political philosophies have changed since 1949 but make no mistakes... for many this matter has not been finally decided!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be but still pretty enjoyable. The ending was kind of predictable though.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|After reading some negative reviews I decided not to give this a try. It sounded like they'd forced too much pointless sex into the show for shock value (like what they've done to True Blood). But we got it as a present for x-mas so I gave in, and I'm glad I did. This show is very good! Clare Danes is excellent in her role. The show is paced well, and keeps you hooked. Yes there is sex, but it's not over the top or unrelated to the story line. You should give it a try, I'm glad I did!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|This absolutely does the job it was advertised to do and does it well.  I'm not fond of the fact that I need it but those situations where you do it comes in handy.  This item simply works.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|very funny and original. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. It was great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app was just what I needed....helpful and easy to use.  I use it all the time. Right at my fingertips!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Love this cd. Beautiful-it is my most listened too. Josh Groban's voice is amazing and the songs are great. Looking forward to his new release.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|Although the visual effects are good, you do not get the fulfillment of watching a good movie based on cons I listed below.<br />I was expecting to see a much better Sci-Fi movie, at least an par with Alien or Blade Runner.<br />I guess my expectetions for a R. Scott movie was too high...<br /><br />Cons: Disappointing scenario, poor character build up,multiple errors in logic flows and reasoning<br />Pros: Good visual effects
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great ending to an awesome trilogy. Best Batman series ever. Smart and stylish-yeah Christopher Nolon. Highly reccommend this movie. Perfect
B009JZVT70|5.0|Great story and plot, both mix well.  Was very supprised on how much I really enjoyed this show.  Cant wait for another season.
B003L77GG0|5.0|the movie came to my door before the promised date, and in perfect condition. I gave this to my husband as a christmas present and he has already finished the series.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This a great book.  It is well written and easy to follow. I also think the themes are easy for kids to grasp.
0525953728|5.0|Great account of the mission. Second by second details of what happened. Good build to the mission also. Detailed, exciting, and difficult to put down.
B004EPZ034|5.0|I had not heard of this, but our daughter gave us this title on the list for our 5 yr. old grandson. He could hardly wait to watch it, so we did, during Christmas dinner. LOL
B009LROCJI|5.0|This re-composition is striking and deeply satisfying. Richter has reinvigorated a beautiful but overplayed piece of music, restoring its wonder and beauty. His original additions build on both large themes and small subtleties in the music, to create a new landscape that feels at once familiar and mysterious. I have been listening to it daily since I purchased it--and only hope I don't turn this re-imagined Vivaldi into too-well-worn territory... But that's a risk one always takes, with avid listening.<br /><br />I would love for him to turn his creative ear and hand to Pachelbel, or to Barber's &#34;Adagio for Strings.&#34;
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't want to put it down. It has lots of interesting twists. Would read again. My favorite of the trilogy.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I have played the &#34;board game&#34; version of this before.  This is a good electronic version.  It will show you places each piece can play, which is nice.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put it down, great book!!!! Can't wait to begin the next one!! Absolutely worth reading of you like steamy love stories
B00594XOZU|5.0|I looove eminem so my username is eminemlover99. Kik me(: the app would be better if u could log out but whatever
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have repeatedly heard friends of friends discussing this trilogy and after reading this first book, I completely understand why. It is something new to me: different, exciting, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I have to say I like Christian more than Anastasia but that's probably only because of all the mystery that surrounds him. I hope books two and three are just as wonderful!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|Every time I am flipping through channels and come across one that is playing The Goonies, I will finish the show.  Imagine my surprise when opening Christmas this year, finding a BluRay copy of a beloved favorite from times past.  I was impressed at the quality of the film, although I wasn't expecting it to be too good due to camera limitations in the time it was filmed.<br /><br />Took me back to 3rd grade when I was first introduced to Mikey and his adventure.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I'm stuck at a level and can't figure it out. I loved it at first because it was very cute and a game in which one would have to think up strategies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book ended the fantastic series of the Hunger Games. I just wish there was more and another story to make it better
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I liked the game at first but as I progressed I could not finish any of them. I do not play video games much at all, so I would recommend this to people who play video games that are clever.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The Time Keeper<br />This will go cover to cover in not time at all.<br />Good fun introspection. Time is on our side..... or...... is it?
B007M45PMU|5.0|I could listen to this album over and over and never get tired of it. Great sound and great lyrics!
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Got this SM card fast and it works great. I can now hold10x s the amount of pictures as before.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is a great cupholder, has room to hold snacks and keys and can also handle small thermos. I got it after I purchased my city select and wish I had included it on my registry.
B006PHD0RW|1.0|Bought this app for my sons nabi and every time you touch the groceries it opens the menu. Can't even play the game! What a waste of time and money!
B00A757EFW|1.0|The control Button is VERY difficult to use!  It will not let you go beyond the 3rd round.  It asks you to buy the extended version to go on. It seems to be slower than the actual arcade game.
B000002IOX|5.0|Great canadian band, great condition of the product! Rush rules!!! It's collective only, there are CD and Vinyl (rare) formats!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the plans, the audio, the translations, the tool etc.... are great. It is beautifully designed, they quickly respond to bugs and you can shar  the word on social networks.
0547884591|5.0|The book is great for it's recopies, but don't call it a cookbook. Insight into developing other skills is what sets this book apart. Tim Ferriss has done something special with his 4-Hour series by helping anyone who wants to help themselves. After getting in his eco-sphere you find yourself looking for his insights in everything you do in your day-to-day to see if he has a tip to make your life easier/better.<br /><br />Would suggest this book to anyone who is going out on their own, has been cooking for years, or is looking to master another skill. For these reasons it is a no-brainer book to gift to college kids, newly married couples, or even your grandmother.
B00846REIS|4.0|Sylvia Day has written an amazing book about lust and love. Day has written a book about two people with troubled pasts and trying to over come them in order to have their relationship grow.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I remember loving Nicholas Sparks when I was younger but this one just didn't do it for me. I didn't tear up once!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved the book and reading about Gideon being a man for his women!! I cannot wait to read book three!
B0046JLTAQ|5.0|great music<br />CD in great shape<br />Shipped very quickly from vendor<br />would recommend this to anyone who is a Pitbull fan
B009FB3XTA|5.0|i was worried at first about getting this due to the reviews being poor. i like it. i feel it has a &#34;twilight&#34; feeling about it. not horrible at all, all the songs were good.
B005EVVESM|5.0|great CD<br />have listened to it over and over again<br />would recommend this CD to my friends<br />shipped very promptly
0345803485|5.0|This book was received as advertised....it is a book that you can't put down once you start reading.  Recommended reading but not for everyone...erotic.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|i love this soundtracks.they re really so good.and i get 2 code too a tf2 item and a dota2 invite code they re work.just my order was bad wrapped.it could take demage so easy...and i did get my box almost 12 days late.i think its about my country post service or international post service.anyway good gift for myself in xmas (forever alone :'D) Türkiye'den alacak arkadaşlar alabilirler sounsuz ancak paket biraz kötüydü.açıkcası kolay hasar görebilecek bir paketlemeydi.1 aralıkta sipriş verdim noralde 17-18 gibi gelmesi gerekirken bana yılbaşı günü ulaştı.müzikler süper.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The story is great, the characters are well defined, the acting is fantastic aside from a couple minor characters.<br />Amazon streaming service is fantastic as well.
0679746048|5.0|I read this straight through. I literally could not put it down. It sad to admit I read this because I liked the movie and wanted more information on the characters and their backstories. I was not disappointed.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As it should be... 5th word required, 8th word required, 11th word required, 14th word required, 17th word required, 20th.
034580404X|5.0|So i swore to myself I wouldn't read this and give in to all the hype about this trilogy. But one day at the beach I had forgotten my kindle and my friend lent me book one for something to do while sunbathing.<br /><br />I didn't really.like book one. I'm just too much of a feminist to relate to this timid little virgin. Don't get me wrong the sex was great but overall I couldn't connect with any of the characters except maybe her roommate Kate.<br /><br />Same friend who lent me book one handed over book two at the end of beach day.telling me \\"you will want to read this as soon as you finish book one\\" I rolled my eyes and accepted to be polite. But she was right, the ending to book one is a cliff hanger so I couldn't help myself and before I knew it I was reading book two. Which I liked much much more than the first. Of the whole series book two is my favorite.<br /><br />Then I broke down and actually purchased book three. I just couldn't help myself.<br /><br />In the end I truly love the series. I disliked book one but it was worth tolerating for the real story which all takes place in books two and three.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not a bad game. Quests are short and everything costs diamonds, which you have to buy. Not great, not bad.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved the Maze Runner! It was so good I couldn't stop reading it! If you haven't read this yet, read it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was drawn into the hype since everyone it seems down to the girl that does my hair has read the trilogy. I can truly say after reading the first one I'm over it and I wasn't missing a thing.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|He chi FHA'shag Rom racing games in Beijing and gentlemen to be the first place for a good book of this article
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner. Tried to figure it out along the way but never did. It really kept me guessing. Couldn't put it down. Well written. Will look for other books by this author.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I suppose I just loved the first book that much more. The activities in the games were not as enthralling
B00005JNS0|5.0|Ordered this for a christmas present for my Great grand son  and he love it. He watches this movie 2-3 times a day.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It is a story that while gruesome and terrifying to read needs to be. It reminds us all that bad things really do happen to good and innocent people.<br /><br />This book broke me in ways I can't begin to explain or understand. This book and Jaycee's story are impossible to not follow. \\"A Stolen Life\\" is ultimately a story of unbelievable faith that she would one day see her mother again and the horrifying things that those monsters did to her while hiding her away for 18 years.<br /><br />Such things are unimaginable and unthinkable but this book brings them right out into the open.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Best family movie for entertainment. Keeps you in stitches. Just as funny as the first two Ice Age movies. Would recommend to anyone.
0553386794|5.0|A GAME OF THRONES -- the HBO series -- was getting all sorts of traction in late 2010/early 2011... and then it debuted in April 2011, and it was super-compelling... I wanted to be more immersed in the world, and that meant reading the books.<br /><br />I picked up the first book in the SONG OF FIRE & ICE saga half way through the first season of the TV series, and devoured it before the first seasoned came to its stunning, cliffhanger of an ending.<br /><br />Martin's prose is crisp, vivid and crackling... remarkably, the TV series is so faithful to this first book it's awesome and inspiring (why can't more books get turned into shows in such a manner?).<br /><br />Fantasy lit since I was first introduced to the genre in the late 70s by J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBITT, and I didn't much care for most of what I read in subsequent years (and was pretty much tired of it after Peter Jackson's films), but this book renewed my faith because it's more of a tale of brinkmanship and geopolitics than its is so-called fantasy.<br /><br />What can I say about the characterizations, plot, theme and high-level of detail that hasn't been said better than I can or obligate me to be redundant except for... it's marvelous, gripping, spine-tingling, insightful and intense.<br /><br />Martin doesn't let up off the gas pedal throughout this book (which can't be said for books 2 and 3, although they are remarkable in their own right).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I don't care for books with too much sex in them, and with all the labeling out there about this book and porn I had no desire, but so glad by chance I read because this is a love story - an intense one - that I couldn't put down.  I'm a reader - I read on average a book a week - mostly murder mystery (read entire Alex Cross series).  Yes, i've read Twilight series, Harry Potter series, Hunger Games series, the Sookie Sackhouse series (HBO true blood is based) and they were all good in my opinion - and my favorite Black Dagger Brotherhood series (amazing).  There is so much more going on then just sex in these books - and this is FAR from porn for anyone that has a clue about sex LOL
B0011NVCSO|5.0|Just had a baby (our third).  Listening to Bon Iver all day and all night long as we spend mellow time with our newborn.  This time will forever be associated with Bon Iver -- both _For Emma, Forever Ago_ and _Bon Iver, Bon Iver_.  Helps that the lyrics may as well be in Norwegian (no criticism intended).
B005COO1X6|4.0|I am a huge fan and have been for many years. I am always excited to read king 's books. I loved it as much as the others I've read.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille scores again. John Corey is dynamic as always.  Couldn't put it down once I had started.  Don't miss this one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a cute story about a couple meeting by chance in Vegas and waking up married.  One remembers what happened, one doesn't.  The question is what to do next.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This recording of an amazing night in a bar should be in every guitar lover's recorded inventory.  The playing is through the roof.  A really fine job has been done to master the sound of this recording as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is the rousing conclusion of the hunger games series where panem is in all out war.  Katniss must rescue Peeta and find her voice as a reluctant symbol of unity in a warring nation.
B009K0OL06|4.0|If you like mysteries/dramas, this is for you. It is well acted and keeps you on the edge of your seat
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Like most of the world, I love these books.  It shows the classic fight of good versus evil as Katniss Everdeen is thrown into the arena of the hunger games where she must fight for her survival against 23 other young men and women.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I think you need to be middle aged to really enjoy this movie.  My mate and I watched it with my brother and sister-in -law, all middle aged, and we laughed through most of the film. The young people won't get it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Panem is in open rebellion.  District thirteen is real and Katniss must fight to get Peeta back, find freedom, and forge a new future, free from oppression.
B005VPRET4|5.0|A favorite Christmas present our 7 year old.  We bought her this set as well as one of the smaller ones.  The smaller one she was able to assemble &#34;solo&#34; which gave her confidence to work on this one.  She needed some help with this one, but was mostly able to put it together independently.
B008XG1X18|4.0|new to this, but has great reciepes that have proven to be good, look forward to using more often, and future stuff
B007REV4T8|4.0|Bond (Daniel Craig) comes out of retirement to take down an opponent (Javier Bardem) who is outing MI5 operatives as part of a very personal campaign against M (Judi Densch).<br /><br />It's good to see Bond back up to snuff after the underwhelming \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" although I have to admit to not quite loving it as much as everyone else.  For my money, \\"Casino Royale\\" is still the best of the reboots.  So many of the scenes in \\"Skyfall\\" go on just a bit too long that the cumulative effect is a very good film that nevertheless feels draggy.  Director Sam Mendes delves into the psyches of Bond and M through their connection to the villain Silva.  Taking this more character driven route could have been a terrible mistake, but they pull it off nicely and take care not to stint on the action.  The climactic showdown, however, doesn't completely work.  It is satisfying emotionally but is anticlimactic coming on the heels of much more spectacular action set pieces from earlier in the film.  I never did quite understand how Bond managed to survive the opening sequence.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next one.  The final scenes of the film seems to be nudging the franchise back toward the Connery-era Bond.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Kids loved it, and the adults as well, we all were capitvated with the movie will watch it again enjoy
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Rating music to me seems to be mostly a matter of your musical taste.  I am not a music critic or schooled in music at all, so I can't make any fancy statements about musical technique, etc.;  I just know what I like.  I love Susan's voice and I really enjoy broadway songs so I love this CD.  All the selections are very enjoyable.  Although I'm not crazy about the arrangement that was used for 'Over the Rainbow' (that's probably because I really like the Judy Garland version)  Susan is wonderful on it.  Susan's voice is incredible on every track.  Her lyrics are so clean and clear and there is extensive emotion in her delivery.  This is the third CD of hers that I have bought and I know that this one will get played just as frequently as the others – which is VERY often.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|Just love the series of books the movie was good watching, streaming worked great no interuptions, We use the ROKU box
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It is fun to see what I can draw that will allow someone else to guess it. I fancied myself an artist of sorts, so this allows me to test my skills.
B0058SNI58|3.0|I wish they would fit but I am just in between sizes.  The strap on the back of the 7s won't stay on my heel.<br />I like the squishy comfort of crocs and would like a pair to wear that don't look like the huge originals.  And good for mild rainy days.  I'm a flip flop girl but in the transition season before my toes get a tan crocs are what I want.
B0070XB0N6|5.0|Fantastic page-turner, will share the thrill with my daughter in a couple of years! (she is now 7yrs old :-) )
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched season 1 in one week and could not wait till I could get season 2.  I have the third season on pre-order!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have not been a follower of Deftones, although I have been aware of them for years. A friend recommended this album as a must have for rock fans, so I decided to pick it up. After the first listen I must admit I didn't think it was super great; I think I needed to acclimate to the very different sounding vocals. However, after giving it a few more listens I am convinced this is one of the best albums of 2012. It rocks solid throughout and I really cannot stop listening to it!!! The heavy hitting bass and guitar riffs are classic and there is a good amount of tempo change-up between melodic and hard-hitting rocking. This will definitely be cycling through my snowboarding and gym playlists!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|This totally worked one my Kindle Fire Hd.  I was not stuck on a loop cycle. This is great, but I can not figure out how to get to my other folders though.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like that there are so many puzzles to choose from. You can choose from 4 levels of difficulty. The one negative is that you can't change the background colors.
B008J34466|5.0|Who doesn't love P!ink. This is a great collection of her songs. A few of course have been on the radio a lot but there are more songs on here that are just as good!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is much more than a dictionary. It does a great job in defining words but it offers numerous links allowing you to explore much more via the Internet.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This one is much better than the rated. I rented this twice, first unrated then by accident the rated. This one is much better.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|As usual the John Rebus novels are well written, exciting, surprising, annoying and fun reading! I also love getting to know Scotland during his books
3257229534|4.0|I read this for a German class where we were discussing the patterns of blame and responsibility in the generations in Germany after World War II and the Holocaust. It was an enjoyable read and I'd recommend it so somebody interested in that sort of thing, however, It was also about a rather unique love story so it almost seemed like the book took on too much and came across as disjointed.<br /><br />It's not on my list of favorite books by any means, but it's worth a try.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I had to get this adapter for a new Lenovo laptop computer to use with Rockwell Automation software that uses COM ports. No issues. Make sure to read the instructions this is not a plug-n-play device. I think you have to install the software FIRST before you attach the device.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Having now watched this movie for the second time, I have found that it is even better. Enjoyed it very much, Matt Damon still did the best job, but Jeremy is a very close second.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is your basic calculator app but it is very helpful not to even mention free. It has a great memory function in case you need to switch between apps while calculating ( I do this a lot when figuring up bills).  It also does percentages for you which comes in handy while trying to figure up how much a sales tax is going to be exactly before getting to the register or wanting to tip a waitress based on the percentage of your bill
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love everything about Lindsey Sterling. Her music moves me, gets into my heart & makes me happy. She writes her own music, arranges it, plays a marvelous violin, part hip hop, part classical sounding, all Lindsey Sterling. I am looking forward to the release of a DVD, so I can watch her dance and flow accross the stage, grass, earth, ice, etc. The amazing way she can go anywhere and just start playing. People around her fall into her spell. Not even knowing who she is and who she will be...a star. Her new CD is wonderful to listen to. It helps me create my art, because she has created hers. So, hey Lindsey, please make us a DVD of your videos. Peace & Love to you.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book was really awesome! It varies quite a bit from the movie and I wish some things from the book were in the movie but I can kind of understand why they were left out. Its definitely worth a read and makes you think about the world you enter after you leave the mortal one you live.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a very good book. Can't wait to read the next book. I hope it is as good as this one.
B005K17RU0|3.0|what em i to say it works good. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11 12
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was my first kindle purchase and I just couldn't put it down. The storyline is great. I won't go into great detail but as another person said, DON'T read the ending as it will spoil it. I wanted to read this book before the movie comes out in February and just by seeing the previews I can already see the differences and that the movie won't do this book justice. Read the book and you'll see what I am talking about.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I stumbled across these guys online and after watching their videos we immediately bought a CD for us and a few others to give away as gifts.<br /><br />These guys are so creative it is crazy.  I highly recommend this album!  I'm sure i'll be buying the next album as well.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This is the second time I have read this book. I am hardly a Manson fan having heard no more than sweet dreams and the beautiful people, but I find this book fascinating. Marilyn Manson is horribly misunderstood. I don't entirely agree with some of his opinions or actions, but this book is well written. He is actually a very intelligent human being.
B007KB15BA|4.0|Since the addition of former TT Quick singer Mark Tornillo, the rest of Accept has risen up and put out 2 solid hard rock / heavy metal records: Blood of the Nations and Stalingrad.  The 2 are pretty much equal overall, maybe a slight edge to Blood of the Nations.  But we're talking about Stalingrad here, so..<br />Wolf Hoffman's leads are inspired and have an old / new feel that is like a familiar friend that you've known forever. The songs are meaty and punchy.  The production is razor sharp. The back beat and rhythm are European - especially the bass work of Peter Baltes.<br />Stalingrad is turning up as one of the best of metal records around the globe in end-of-2012 polls, and I agree completely.  Ahhh, the glory of headbanging!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i injoy playing flow free i just started and can't stop. i don't have a lot of games on my kindle fire but this is one i'm glad i have.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|The package come very quickly and  all albums were in it.<br />They came exactly as decribed and appeared .<br />The price was reasonable for all the albums
B0052U59F4|5.0|It's a Great love story. The writing flows well and is easy to believe. They truly belong together for a lifetime.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|This movie is truly awful. The story goes and acting is questionable. On the other hand it is a visual and the 3D is done well. Watch this movie with sound off.
B008476HBM|5.0|Good tale! It was funny, heart warming and holds your attention until the end. It is definitely worth the read!
1591841666|1.0|have you ever wondered whether your one-page epiphany could be so pumped up with fluff and silly drawings that it would fill a small book? if you're seth godin, you don't even have to be a good writer to pull this off. this was a dull, meandering little essay that can be reduced to less than a page (several people have done just that in their reviews). and i'm not talking about summarizing, which assumes that you leave out some important details and just focus on the main points. there are no important details in this book, just a few main points dressed up and plumped up with lots of rambling and spiced up with illustrations. i can't blame the guy... apparently his name is enough to get just about anything published. but make no mistake, in this \\"book\\" seth godin reaches literary whoredom.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Strong characters with witty and BELIEVABLE  personalities and an excellent plot development kept me from putting this novel down until it was finished. Can't stop thinking about it now!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Just like you remember it when you were younger ! It's Yahtzee from back in the day!! The game it's addicting!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and not boring<br />A little aggravating waiting for energy recharge. And Gavin th to buy more diamonds but overall it is enjoyable.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|As president Obama said, Ann Hathaway as Catwoman is the best; amazing actress. As far as entertainmnet is concerned, one can't be miss with a movie like that. How Bruce Wayne is able to do Batman with severe arthritis is medically speaking very intriguing.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Well almost. The movie is better than the book. Fuller, more depth, and totally delicious. I own this and watch it over and over.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Led Zeppelin is still hot all the years since forming in the late 60's. Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are the best of their own talents and styles... I rated it Number one~~!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everyone needs a calculator and this one is perfect! I have used it a lot and it has never let me down!
B001I45UFC|1.0|The book is amazing because ,I can picture most of the areas it is talking about in the book.  I had wonders about parts.  This book is all ages, I think it is
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It has really good acting by some really good actors (Gordon_Levitt, Blunt) and the story is not your typical science fiction tale.  The sound effects, music, and the sets all helped sell the story.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in science fiction or pseudo-Mob stories.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I was looking and looking for wood toys and discovered a bunch on amazon. This one is now on its second round with child #2. Great product
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn did a wonderful job at writing this story. The characters Nick & Amy were  hard to actually like, but you're really not supposed to like these people any way.  I love mystery/thrillers that don't ruin the story with too much foreshadowing where you figure out every detail by the end. It definitely kept me guessing and I had a hard time putting the book down.  I would highly recommend this book.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I heard all this award talk about homeland and finally decided to check it out. My husband and I are addicted. W have been watching 3 episodes a night to catch up to the new season that starts jan 2013
1603425381|5.0|If you love to crochet and and always in the market for creative ways to add borders - then this book is for you
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The author seems to sell out her characters' original motivation and style so they end up bland and saccharine and boring.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Bought this for the husband for Christmas and he loves it!  Jason Bonham was a joy for him to watch.
B000000WFZ|4.0|This music stands the test of time and stands alone separate from the fine film. Yo Yo Ma has recently recorded the haunting &#34;Gabriel's Oboe&#34;.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This was billed more as a comedy and while there were some funny parts the overall movie was more serious and kind of sad.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I want more like this one it was great I love mysteries like this puzzle type game<br /><br />Anymore.like this one??
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|MoboPlayer is a quick install, and very user friendly which is great because I am not very technologically savvy. I can now easily upload any of my movie/tv shows to my KindleFire.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The Pendergast series books are always riveting.  You can't wait for the next page.  Waiting anxiously now for the next book.  Hurry Preston and Child.
1878424319|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Four Agreements\\" for the second time and it seemed like a completely different experience this time. Its a year later so obviously I am at a different place. I got so much more our of the book this time. The agreements were better but the implementation process at the end was awesome.<br />-Bruce Raine, author of [[ASIN:B007BP9FP8 Attitude Determines Destiny]]
B00915G6SU|5.0|I got this eight season ,because my daughter collects them .She just loves watching the show,so I,ve been getting the season for her.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A lot like the Ville series on Facebook, probably created by the same developers.nice and quick app on my kindle
B0058YPILY|5.0|MY daughter collects the dvd's of criminal minds,so I get them for her as presents when the dvd's come out.
1416955070|3.0|It was just ok for me.  I don't know if I am interested in continuing the series or not and for me that is saying a lot.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This is a great movie that I remember from my earlier years.  I love the Muppets world and all their shenanigans.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I bought these after my pair of Sennheiser HD 448's headband broke. While not detrimental to their function, mending the plastic piece that broke would have prevented some adjustability in one side of the headband.<br /><br />This seemed like the perfect excuse to find a new pair of headphones, and this one has been on my list as a great value buy for a while. I love listening to lossless audio tracks through my DIY PPAv2 headphone amplifier, and these pair of cans sound lovely after being worn in for only about 12 hours. I know they will continue to improve and mature with use as their diaphragms loosen up. They sound great with any style of music I throw at it, from percussive jazz, hip-hop, and electronica music to classical, folk, and easy-listening music. I'm not going to get into specifics of sound, as that will change over time, most likely for the better, but from experience so far these headphones will be a real workhorse in the future. Having a solid headphone amp is recommended, but not required, as the 55 ohms is efficient enough to be powered by most modern electronics. A DAC in the signal path would improve the sound quality and performance even more.<br /><br />This is a quality product, well worth the $60 I paid. Earpads and headband are comfortable and durable in every respect. Earpads and cable are replaceable as well. If you're looking for quality headphones, comparable in the same price range $60-$100 as I was, I would recommend the Sony MDR-V6, Grado SR-60i, Sennheiser HD 429, or Shure SRH440. These were the other headphones on my shopping list, and I simply found these K-240s to be the best deal of the bunch at the time. Hope this helps anyone looking for a solid buy in this area.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I enjoy playing the Mahjong games but after a few minutes of play, the game freezes and even shutting off the device, does not unfreeze.  The game has to be left and continued at another time.  I've lost interest because of the bugs.
B000M6WK28|5.0|Awesome album! Classic Elvis Costello album, finally got to hear it in its entirety. And it was a great price with quick, cheap shipping.
B008M721MS|5.0|just the book I had been looking for, loving this kindle, totally awesome! great prices on everything. Great selection of things.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|This app erased all my data on my tablet. I'm not sure if it has a virus in it or not but Please Don't get it!!!!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I am not a comic book reader, I don't know these characters history, but one day my friend and I watched all of her marvel based videos, OMG I am hooked. The seller got this to me in record time and in great condition. I couldn't be happier.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A Christmas Carol is a wonderful book for anyone to read.  I have always liked this book and now I can read it every year through Amazon..
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!! I bought it as a christmas present for my niece just because I love it so much. The seller get it to me in speedy time and in perfection condition. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great,  I couldn't put it down. Very relatable to teens and young adults. Great read, definitely recommend
B000MV9026|4.0|I have a little niece that loves to sing. You show her a movie and she is ready to hit her note right on que...and I love to see her do. So this was a purchase to get some good quialty time in.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I love this classic. It has a nice plot with lots of emotion and a touch of whimsy. The only reason I gave it four stars was because it was kind of short, and went by so fast!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are a fan of 50 shades or you're looking for something at that same level but seems like it's more written for adults, this is the book for you!! Sylvia Day does a wonderful job in her writting by making you fall in love with the main characters. I for one wanted to hug Gideon because though he seems so wonderful, he is truly broken. It's worth a purchase and a read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Omg . This book is amazing . It has teen problems . Love problems . Sex problems real life situations I can just relate to it & that's the best part..
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I have played it nonstop! Every song is great! I can not praise it highly enough. My husband even loves it! It is a great reminder of the movie scenes. I cry several times in certain songs. This is by far the best movie soundtrack I have ever listened to! You will not be disappointed!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book makes my happy and I could read it for day .I have read it two times now.also the book is funny!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|My son and I have watched the 1st one several times and are amazed of how the story grips<br />you.  Fantastic, and it is well done.  We love it and hope for more down the road.  Can't<br />wait to watch #2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is very fun and a very enjoyable app to play when you are bored but it is most best because it is many different games in one
B0015AARJI|5.0|It Works great. I only wish they came with a cord to charge it. Also this one doesn't turn off automatically after so long like my old one did. I don't know if that's something you can change on the ps3 or not.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it is the best diary of a wimpy kid I have ever bought! :)<br />I can't wait for the next one to come out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 4 and 6 year old boys love this game and it looks and plays great on the Kindle.  Thanks!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great books!  Can not wait to read the next one!  Wished the next movie would come out sooner than November!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Kids love playing this game on the new Kindle Fire HD!  They were use to it on a smartphone so the larger screen size is fantastic!  Thanks!
B004UJTG6Q|2.0|It won't let me read the book so I have nothing to put as a review for this hopefully after this I can read it
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Didn't expect much from the movie except for decent acapella singing but was pleasantly surprised on how funny it was.  Loved the different eccentric characters!
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Story line is being stretched a bit (pirates?), but still good family time. A number of humorous items appropriate for kids.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Good Movie but not as great as other Bourne series. Don't keep expectation as high as other movies in this series.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|Then it skipped the shark.  I loved being transported to India.  I didn't understand the character's motivation to fight and belong to a terrorist group.
1400052173|5.0|I originally read this book for a research project for school, and ended up just reading it for pleasure and abso. love it kept my attention, but the chapter when the author got into deep details about the family ... got boring.. but overall good read fr biology/oncology majors!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Outstanding cast, beautiful setting, great story with humor and the trials of aging mixed with finding new directions for your life and new friends and realizing the adventure in your life never ends until it ends.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Always wanted a kindle fire, which I got for Christmas.  I love Facebook, so this was a right App for my Kindle.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I just finished the upgrade of my three-year-old desktop computer by adding a new hard with 64-bit OS to my 32-bit hard drive, which came with my computer.  I added more RAM for that drive for a total of 7 GIGs of RAM.  I love the dual boot system that I can now separate work and play and not get so many viruses and yuck just by using my browser.  It's also faster, too.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|This book is well written, easy to read, and provides a lot of very good meeting strategies if you meet with clients to sell products or services.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|a must read! changed my perspective on where we are going with technology. really, really interesting. I couldn't put it down!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good game me and my kids love it we take turns playing it all day thanks so much guys you rock
B00139XTG4|5.0|even better read with Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. Lots to gain from exploring these topics. I enjoyed Taleb's style with a mix of the very technical to the more literary chapters.
B0002X1JKU|2.0|I have read a few books on stock investment. Being the book labeled by many as \\"a must read\\", I thought I should read it too to improve my investing knowledge.<br /><br />Problem is, I find it hard to read the book. Maybe it is the content, describing the market, etc. while I was looking for the \\"how\\" of stock investing.<br /><br />I have tried twice reading this \\"must read\\" book. Maybe I will give it another go and this 3rd time will be my last.<br /><br />There are better books on the \\"how\\" of share investing, e.g., The Five Rules For Stock Investing, Common Stocks Uncommon Profit which I will give 5* each.<br /><br />My 2 cents.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|a great book. there's a reason it's a classic. it's so unique, great characters, kind of crazy, but still totally relevant. highly recommended!
B009H1S56O|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas, and he loves it.  (That is all I have to say.  OK.)
B00555X8OA|5.0|yes, it's long, but he does a great job of keeping what could be a very dry topic from getting deathly boring. it's dense though, not a quick read, or a page-turner. but there is so much to learn. and the biggest takeaway is how we humans think we are rational actors and logical thinkers... and how we really aren't.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Beautiful movie for the entire family. We really enjoyed it. I would recommend it for a feel good movie night.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|Ok, it wasn't like Arnold's movie from back in the day. They did some nice homage to the original, but made it their own. I like Colin Farrell, but I bought this movie because it has plenty of action and suspense.<br /><br />A major reason I bought this is because they have two of the most gorgeous bad ass women duking it out!  C'mon, UnderWorld's  Kate Bechinsale and Blade's Jessica Biel!!!!!<br /><br />Good fight scenes between these gorgeous girls and you can sense the hatred between them. Cat fight and WWE all wrapped up in one.<br /><br />Get the movie, forget about the 1980's original, and enjoy the flick.
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is great when I quickly need to look a word up weather it's for spelling, definition, or pronunciation.
B006VREHRS|5.0|I don't have cable, but I heard so much about this program and found that it was very good. I'm glad that one can sample an episode of a program before deciding whether to buy the whole season.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|once app is calibrated to your device, it is very accurate.This app is on the money and very helpful. Also helps keep battery life in good health.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great TV show, one of the most suspenseful shows I've ever watched. This is a MUST SEE show for sure.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I originally wasn't sure I wanted a Kindle as I work in a library and thought I would be cheating. I mainly got it for Internet and App purposes as its cheaper than a computer or I-pad. Now that I have it I can't imagine life without it. I LOVE IT!!  Love Amazon also!!!  I have ordered many things from them and have never been disappointed.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative, with good detailed info on the \\"why\\" of it all. An excellent read, and a lot of what the author said rang bells for me, especially about the addiction to wheat products. I'm going to try wheat free for 30 days and see what happens.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|Our teen-age daughter really liked this one and watched it several times, and the parents thought it was pretty good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this book knowing it was a simple romance, but after reading the first chapter I knew I was in for way more! I simply couldn't put this book down , definitely a recommended read!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|All 3 Toy Story movies are fun to watch for both the adults and kids in our family. This is a great addition to a family movie collection.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|We saw this movie when it came out in the theater. We like it so much we rented it when it became available to rent. I would recommend this movie as a good family night movie rental.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music has been a family favorite for many years, so we are happy to have it in blu-ray & DVD. It's better than ever! The story of love and family is touching, and the music is beautiful!
B0064T6LV8|1.0|The Pinball Deluxe game isn't very exciting at all. Especially if you compare it to so many of the games today. Sorry, but not enough action in this one.<br /><br />'
0345525558|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It is well written, and the language of flowers is interwoven in the story in many intriguing ways. My book club read this, too, and it was a favorite for many!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome it great you should get it. the controls are easy. once I played I couldn't stop. I recommend. this to you for sure.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Our family all enjoyed this one. It's creative and funny, and we are happy to have our own copy to add to our video collection!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app was so worth it and so easy to use. You can even make memes on it of your photos I highly suggest this app. :)
B0036TGSIK|3.0|We were not all that impressed with the story line here. Our daughter enjoyed it more than the adults did.
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|I used to play this game when I was a small child.I forgot how fun this game used to be,I'm glad to see some games don't disappear completely.
1439170045|5.0|This book tells the story of an early-onset Alzheimer's patient. I found it well written, and those in my book club were glad we had chosen it. I understood the trials and progression of Alzheimer's much better after reading this. It is recommended by the Alzheimer's society, too.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I have just about all the angry bird games on my Kindle,Now your talking about the big green guy,it's alot of fun.Iwould recommand to any body.
B007IYWY3C|5.0|Its great. Exaclty what I expected. Florence is glorious and the quality is fine. I hope MTV makes more unpluggeds.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|The author has a very interseting theory and topic, but spends too much time bashing many others and doesn't need to to make his points.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|It had the cover I was expecting. The quality is excellent and the product was perfect. Great music and perfect design. I am glad I could have it.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's fun and entertaining, but gets old after a while.  IT gets lopsided when one person is a great drawer and the other draws bad stick figures.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This product has stamps, the confidencials and the audio commentaries. The quality is excelent. The thing that I didn't expect was the cover because is an hologram. But its fine and perfect. Great product.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great to share photos with family etc., BUT it gets out of hand, -  and your business and others business is far to highly shared.  Luckily FB provides settings to control this problem.  If you want to know others political viewpoints and their latest relationship status, you WILL! ... or you can block that nonsense too.
B001DPC52C|4.0|The DVD is great but the CD have not as many songs as I was expecting. But apart from that it great
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very good, moves along and is interesting.<br />I like these kind of games, and this is a very good one.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another strong addition to the Pendegrast books.  Nazi's in general are somewhat overplayed, but the twist is in the ability Preston gives Albon which ties the book together nicely.  Would have liked to see more of the Corrie sub plot, that seemed contrived and very paint by the numbers writing which was disappointing considering Preston's abilities.<br />Overall worthy, and looking forward to the Preston's next book.
1451673442|5.0|There is virtually nothing new under the sun including making gratitude an integral part of your daily life. This book reminds of of that very thing with the stories and the easy and fun exercises. I am on page 28 and have seen quite a difference in the way my life unfolds when, no matter the challenge, I find something to be grateful for. Ms. Byrne reminds of the Universal Law of like attracts like, as well as words and thoughts become things and we must choose carefully. Good job!
B00008MLSH|5.0|Miss Netrebko's beautiful voice does not disappoint in this varied selection of well-known and beloved opera arias.  Exquisite trills and other nuances!  I highly recommend it.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|A bit sluggish and repetitive in events...but imaginative  and exhilaration builds as you wait impatiently for what's to come! Enjoy
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|The movie was funny enough and also full of those obligatory 1980s pop culture references that everything seems to have nowadays, but nothing revolutionary. It awkwardly attempts to tug at your heartstrings in some instances but then wastes the entire seen with a quick penis joke.<br /><br />All in all, it was enjoyable but definitely only a rental.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this book was humorous and action packed, simply the best book ever. It was also inspiring. Can't wait till the House of Hades
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game a lot and thing that it is waay better than temple run. at first I thought it was going to be a lame version of temple run but it is so much more fun. you still have power ups but the whole having trains thing is way cooler. I love this game.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|my husband loved the watch It is elegant and classy. I love it as well. Was thinking about ordering more for myself and my daughter.Awesome!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So amazing, a thrill ride with an unexpected ending. I recommend  this  to those who  love their romance and sex.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Definitely not Harry potter, not a murder mystery but an amazing thriller. I couldn't put the book down for anything#
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Let's see, the original Total recall with Arnold released in 1990, 22 years ago. So, if you can resist the temptation to compare that film with the very loose adaption (at best) of the 2012 release, you might enjoy this excellent sci-fi film. Just think of it as a entirely different movie which coincidentally has the same title. INMHO, the acting, story line, special effects and directing of this release are far superior to the original. I thought it was a great flick but then I didn't try to compare or dissect the differences of the two. Who cares if this Quaid is not like the one 22 years ago. Let it go folks and take it for what it is.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Wish extra coins didn't cost so much. Otherwise, playing is fun and enjoyable. 4 stars because I don't like waiting for more coins to be able<br />to play again.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Anyone who grew up in my generation remembers Macaulay Culkin and the Home Alone movies.  I picked this up for my wife for Christmas, and she was thrilled.  Great family-friendly film which I will enjoy watching one day with my kids, just like my parents did with me.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I'm happy with this collection overall.  I was not really a Bon Jovi fan until recently when he made an appearance on the Jersey Shore to view the devistation and then on stage for the victims' benefit concert.  So buying this item was timely as the collection is their best stuff.  A few of the songs are monotinous (sp?) but overall a good listen.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The love story between Catherine and Heathcliff was largely unimpressive and exceedingly disappointing.  I immensely suspect that confederates of Heathcliff have either not read the second half of the story or are ignorant to the terrors of domestic violence.  Where the plot lays asunder, I'd remark that Brontë's ability to truly abhor me in the chilling degradation of Heathcliff and the ghastly haunting story that ensues, greatly pulls together an all around unsettling finish to an otherwise unremarkable tale.  Over all while I can only fault the book for the story, the writing was much to my liking and I may very well come back to it in later years with a different eye.  I think it's worth venturing a read, but I'd say not to get your hopes up on everything everyone sells Heathcliff to be.
B007V4QMFK|2.0|The cd itself was fine and the order was correct but the cd cases were all broken. This was really disappointing and I wish I would have been able to send them back for good condition cases
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an amazing job Suzanne Collins<br />has done. I only wish I read the book sooner but you know what they say better late than never. I couldn't put down the book. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Dumb movie.<br />Thumbs down<br />Stupid concept and nonsense.cant believe Mark came out on this Mila was the only good part
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book,  more than that, this adventure of a story made me have the somewhat kid-like urge to give up everything, to live a life like the one depicted and adventure with or as a hero like Percy Jackson, and live like I wished I could every time I opened up the book and disappeared in the world of Percy Jackson, Jason Grace, and many more heroes of Riordan's books. And to all of you who agree with my liking to these fictional adventures, I have one question, why are you reading this while a vast world of books await?
B00770KR7W|4.0|Displaying on my desk, a nice gift from my youngest for her gamer dad. Be careful with the gun's attachment tab - accidentally broke when my wife was trying to get the gun off his back.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Amazing! It is perfect for all people. If I had a chance to meet a character from any book it would be Joey.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|I received these for christmas this year and they've been great. I've used them with my ipad, ipod, blackberry, pc, and my tv for playing xbox and watching tv with them. They have great crisp sound and fantastic bass as well.<br /><br />They're self adjusting which is a nice feature. Comes with a 3.5mm jack with a great screw-on 1/4\\" adapter as well.<br /><br />They are made out of plastic, but I'm only noting that in case you were expecting metal.<br /><br />I actually want to get a little headphone amp for these because I doubt my devices are driving them to their full potential.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The. Book was horrible i didnt like it because it had 2 many words and . A lot of pages
B00A8ECU24|4.0|love the game took me forever to figure out how to get friends lol wish stuff didn't cost so much that's the only complaint
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a painfully beautiful love story with a sad true ending. I love that. It shows that bad and goods thing are in the world.
B0083TU61S|5.0|I am so looking forward to reading this to my grandchildren and to my future students in my own classroom.  Thank you!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book should have a way to search for the word you are looking for. If there is already please tell me where it is!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|4.0|i've been a lifelong bond fan, i've seen every film more than once and have a big soft spot for the series. i can say without a doubt that this is one of the series best installments. Craig is fantastic as Bond once again and there are some great nods to the history of the franchise. it is very different i will say, it's not the jokey gadgety womanizing Bond film though there is some of that, it's just a little more personal and layered. bardem is a great villain, something that was missing from the last two. just see it. i loved it.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|A huge amount of money apparently spent on special effects, but it didn't make the movie any good.  Watch the original with Arnold.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I was totally unsure of what to expect from this sort story but it was Sanderson and I had no doubt in my mind it would be wonderful. I was not disappointed<br /><br />The story here ... even being quite short I found the grasping of a new magic ability and a few characters to be very easy to flow into and totally enjoy.<br /><br />While at first an ability to change an object by reshaping its past may seem mundane and not very useful, but Sanderson really showed this at a wonderful level and as well created a perfect groundwork for an entirely new train of thought.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great book.  It was a slow starter, but the 2nd half was a page turner.  My only complaint is that it had too many similarities to Sleeping With the Enemy, an older book that was made into a movie starring Julia Roberts.  Sparks must have been a fan.  Some of the scenes were not original, especially when they were at the carnival.  The Ferris wheel scene was almost identical.  If you haven't seen that movie you will love this book.
0345803507|5.0|I actually felt a little sad at finishing this series - I just wanted Ana and Christian's story to go on and on..... I loved these characters and found myself totally engrossed in their lives. It is obvious to me why people have gone a tad crazy over these books :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was the first book of John Green's I read.  I thought it was so well written.  I plan to look for others he has written.
0345803485|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - talk about a rollercoaster of emotions! I had trouble reading some parts of it as I had tears literally streaming down my face and my glasses were fogging up...<br /><br />In the beginning it reminded me of a Victoria Holt novel ( young, inexperienced girl falls for rich and handsome man), but with graphic sex scenes that never would have appeared in one of Victoria's books. Then the spankings reminded me a bit of the Outlander series and I remembered the flack Diana got for that scene - guess those readers would not appreciate 50 Shades then! I know this started as Twilight fanfic, but I honestly didn't see Edward and Bella in there at all.<br /><br />I am so glad I have book 2 already so I can start reading it as soon as the kids go to bed tonight :)
0307719774|5.0|Since this is a 5-year journal and the book is small-sized, it is just right for the person who can barely manage to write a line or two a day.  Not only that, it gives you a question prompt so you only have to answer the question and get out of there. Perfect.  When I want to ramble or free associate or make lenghier notes, I write in a standard black and white notebook.  For a daily journal type book, this is fine. And I'm more likely to write a one/two line entry every day BECAUSE I know it's only going to take a minute or two to do.<br /><br />This is perfect for a young adult who is just starting to keep a journal because the chance of success is higher, IMO, and they can see previous years all together on the same page.<br /><br />Update: Having used this journal for almost a month now (without missing a day!) I can say without hesitation that THIS is the journal for me. Even on days when I don't feel I have much to say I can muster up a line or two to answer the daily prompt. Perfect! And sometimes I even wonder what I'll say for this same question a year or three years or five years from now...  Very interesting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel app provides the needed information when traveling or updating home information.  I love having it at my fingertips.  It is as reliable as weather information can be.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Didnt watch it becuase of the inferior video quality.  See my previous review for 'Your Sister's Sister&#34;.  didnt even bother.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent read. John Grisham really can captivate any reader. I was not able to set it down, recommend it highly
B009VB97EY|2.0|Thought this would be fairly light chippendale type movie.  Underlying story was a little rough for what I was looking for.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am honestly not even sure how I found this book, but I am so incredibly glad I did! I can't top what other reviews have said, so I won't even try. If you have not read Wool, don't waste any more time - the omnibus edition is well worth the price. This is an amazing story!
0671449028|4.0|I usually read this book to my toddler son before bedtime.  It's a cute book and I like it more than some of this authors other works but it's not one of her best ones either.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I can't imagine what the author was thinking when he wrote this. I'm 3/4 of the way through and wondering why I'm bothering to finish. I like Grisham for the most part, but he should apologize for this piece of trash.
067144901X|5.0|My toddler loves this book.  I don't like all of Boynton's books but this one is really fun and we read it a lot.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Interesting storyline.<br />Loved the big brother.<br />The characters bodies were created too distorted for me.<br />There were some very funny LOL clips<br />Subtitles a plus.<br /><br />In spite of all the pro's I simply didn't care for it.
0525478817|5.0|a lovely book that is a must read. heart touching for teens+. death, poetry, love & adventure all in this book. shipped fast and new
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great price for all three discs!! It came quickly and we were able to watch them over the holiday break.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|There are no likeable characters in this flick. Even Thor and Charlize Theron couldn't get me to rally behind this flick. I understand they were going for a darker version of the fairy tale, but the movie could have used a few lighter moments to get us to like the protagonists. As they have it, there is zero chemistry between the Hemsworth's huntsman and Stewart's Snow White. The lack of romantic spark between the two leads becomes even more painful to watch when the movie tries to get us to buy in to the spell breaking \\"surprise\\" of having the huntsman's kiss being the one that actually breaks the curse and not that of Prince Charming.<br /><br />While I admit to being predisposed to being annoyed by Kristen Stewart's acting, courtesy of the Twilight series, her performance in this movie does nothing to dispel her reputation for being a one note actress.  She really lays on her moody, constipated performance thick in this flick as well. Seriously, I didn't get why we were supposed to believe that her Snow White was anything special. She is that wooden.  And what were the casting guys thinking when they cast an evil queen that is ten times hotter than Snow White????!!! It was truly distracting. I wanted to yell at the queen that her mirror was a FREAKING LIAR!!!!<br /><br />I give it two stars for the good camera work and look of the movie, but the rest is just soulless.<br /><br />Who the heck are these people giving this 4 and 5 stars anyway?  I just don't see it!
0307596885|5.0|I can not write a review because I did not read the book. My wife said it was a 10/10 for a rating. hope that helps everyone. thank you very much and I hope you like the book too.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|No words can describe how good this book was. I read it one day cause I couldn't put it down.
0062124293|1.0|Had to read for a book club. Not my thing, British young humor.  I skipped more pages than I read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. It's so easy to toggle between this and other apps at the same time. But the best part was its free
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|i liked it a lot.  Interesting sci-fi movie.  My wife usually doesn't like action movies but she approved of this one.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|i purchased this game for my nephew and he really enjoyed the future on the games alot more action and the angry birds have alot more action...
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is why I love this book. Simply put, it's twisted!  When you think you know what is happening, it changes. This book is a top favorite of mine.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My kids loved this movie since the first time they saw it.  I did too.  Having it in on Blu-ray only added to the enjoyment of such a visually pleasing movie.  This slides onto the shelf next to &#34;Christmas Story&#34; and &#34;Elf&#34; for our annual holiday movie viewing.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Game is too simple,  designed for a 4 - 10 year old, which is too easy to get bored of playing fast.
0446554995|5.0|I just love the Pendergast books. There are books I buy as paperback and those I only buy hardbound. This series is one that I only buy hardcover. If you haven't read any of the Pendergast series...try it. You just might love it as much as I do.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome yeah the adds get alittle bad but overall I think its a good game especially. on the kindle
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for my fiance who keeps a pocket knife at all times but always complains its dull. Its small but does its job very well. Definitely a great buy/gift for pocket knife lovers, hunters or even for campers. It sharpens well & quick.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book as well as all the other twilight books was awesome.<br /><br />The movie followed the book pretty well. Love all the movies and books.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I never seen before this kind of shows, but from the first season this show catch all my attention. Great show, great characters.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I have not yet mastered the game, but have enjoyed what part of it I've played so far.<br /><br />On my Samsung Galaxy S3 is great and works well.  I have trouble with it on the first generation Kindle Fire; the game senses my touch about 1/8 of an inch to the left of where my stylus or finger is, which is not good.  I haven't tried it on the Fire HD or the Nexus 10 yet..
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|While all of the previous movies in the Resident Evil series were at least enjoyable, Retribution doesn't even reach that level. The movie didn't really continue the story from the others. Instead, it just had very random fighting throughout. ( Zombie Nazi's?) I quickly found myself getting bored with the movie and was quite ready for the end to come. Not even worth a rental.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|This is a very unique show from the mind of Joss Wheden (firefly, serenity, angle, avengers etc.) Eliza Dushku was a perfect fit for the roll she plays. I don't know anyone that did not like this show, its a sifi about using people as dolls, temporarily replacing peoples minds with that of others or that of someone desired, for the rich to enjoy, but its not without its issues. I would have liked to see this show go on and not have to end so quick but at least there was a 2nd season. Worth giving it a watch and buying if you like it.
B006WXHJTO|5.0|It the best of all the pies, very funny .... if you like the othes you will enjoy this much....
B008FPOIT6|4.0|The plot of was a pleasant adventure, an easy read.  I enjoyed the contrast between traditional books and modern sources of information.
B001EBV0OY|3.0|I read the book for class. I watch the movie before the showing of it in class. I thought it was okay. I do love being able to rent the movies over the computer it is like 5 stars convenient.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Storyline is very interesting overall really enjoyed this game. But I don't like how it makes you pay for the full version.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play this with friends and it is fun to see what gets drawn!  Try the free version, if you like it you can move up.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Confused as whether it was a comedy or rude chic-flick.  There were some funny spots but mostly I found myself trying to laugh.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lange is incredible, as always, and this show really sucked me in, I am so hooked!!!  I simply love it!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Loved the look but the acting didnt' really grab me. I felt that this movie was made to mostly provide the requisite amount of gun fire and explosions. As odd as the original movie was with Arnold, I still got into that story more.
1451695195|4.0|I've read a number of books detailing near-death experiences; this one is unique. First, the author is a prominent neurosurgeon who admits he could not reconcile beliefs in a spiritual afterlife with his scientific knowledge, before his life-threatening emergency and coma. Next, the author gives a very detailed description of what he saw and felt. But, what I appreciated more than anything was his rebuttal to the typical explanations of such experiences by the scientific community - explanations that he had supported for many years. If you like to read about near-death experiences, read this book!
B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|Let me start this review by saying that I've been a Keane fan, probably since about mid-late 2007 when I heard the song &#34;Is It Any Wonder&#34; on a guided tour for the original iPod Touch and I looked up the song on YouTube and that's when I knew, I wanted more. I bought, Hopes And Fears, and Under The Iron Sea, and you probably can figure out the rest. Anyway I bought their EP Night Train at Wal-Mart the night before a big trip this past summer. And when I listened to it I had mixed and conflicting feelings. It took 5 or 6 times listening to it all the way through for me to sort out my thoughts and form an opinion on the album. And here are my thoughts on each track.  Right off the bat, I would suggest skipping the 1st track &#34;House Lights&#34;. It's not really a song as much as it is a minute and a half collective of weird noises, and minor and faint drum machine beats with almost no rhythm. You hear a little bit of beginning noises from couple of songs from Keane's last album, &#34;Perfect Symmetry&#34; here, but it's nothing truely interesting. (1/5)  The 2nd track and 1st song on the EP &#34;Back in Time&#34; is one of the better on the album and one you'd probably enjoy...provided you didn't stop the EP after hearing House Lights. The melody resembles the more techo styled songs from &#34;Perfect Symmetry&#34; but it's still really enjoyable compared to some of the other songs here. Kind of generic, repetitive one-line chorus, doesn't really stand out, but it's still an enjoyable song.(4/5...although I might have been a little too generous here.)  The 2nd song (track 3) &#34;Stop for a Minute&#34; is the single on the EP. This song is the first of two on the EP, to feature Somali-Canadian Recording Artist K'naan. The Singing is great, Tom and K both have great singing voices. I thought the song was good...that is, until K'naan started to rap. I don't have a problem with Rap music. In fact, I like rap; actually, I love Rap. I have music by Eminem, NaS, Slaughterhouse, Wu-Tang Clan, Yelawolf, Tech N9ne, Immortal Technique, Diabolic, and Apathy, just to name a few, and I enjoy all of them. And I even Love K'naan. He's a very talented rapper, I recommend you check out his album Trubador. its a fantastic album. unfortunately, I found his verse here to be extremely lacking. The &#34;cuticles&#34; line is cringe-worthy, and if you don't like the rap verse by that line, I would suggest skipping the rest of the track, because it doesn't get any better after that. (3/5) There is however a version of this song that has the rap verse taken out and it really is better.  The next track &#34;Clear Skies&#34;, unlike the last song, doesn't fall flat on its face half-way through. Tom Chaplin does some really nice Vocal and acoustic guitar work here. This is probably the least piano driven song I've ever heard by Keane. Which is a nice change of pace  (4/5)  The next song, &#34;Ishin Denshin (You've Got to Help Yourself)&#34;, Maybe it's good, Maybe it's bad, I don't know 'cause I don't know Japanese. The really repetitive chorus is the only part of the song that is performed vocally by the members of Keane. The rest is sung by Tigarah. I don't know who she is, and if this song is any indication, I don't think I want to. (1/5)  The next song &#34;Your Love&#34; features vocals by Keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley Rather than Tom Chaplin. This is the first and only time this has happened, as of this review. This song is unlike anything else on the whole EP. This is a great song, very dark, very sad.  almost perfect. Tim actually has a good voice, and I'd like to hear him sing on some songs on future Keane releases. Don't get me wrong,Tom Chaplin has a great voice, I just Like bands with 2 or more vocalist. It adds a bit of Variety, Which is good. The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and Queen on the first 8 albums, are perfect examples. But I digress. Great song, and a voice I'd like to hear more of on future Keane albums. (5/5)  Track 7, &#34;Looking Back&#34;...really? Really!? REALLY!?! Was sampling the theme song from Rocky (Yes, the Theme song from Rocky, I kid you not.) really Necessary? Also, was having K'naan Deliver a rap verse, somehow even worse than his verse on `Stop for a Minute&#34;, really worth this song sucking so badly? This crap is even worse than &#34;House Lights&#34; which can't even be classified as a song. Wow this just sucks. The first time I played the EP, I skipped to the next song about 2 and a half minutes in. I read that &#34;Stop for a Minute&#34; was the start of Keane's collaboration with K'naan. Let's all hope this disgrace marks the end of it. (1/5)  There are many cases in music where the best song on the album is saved for last. This would be one of those times. The final track &#34;My Shadow&#34; is hands down the best song on the EP. It starts off small and not very loud and as it progresses, it slowly turns into an epic &#34;grande Finale&#34; of sorts. This song could hold it's own with songs from Under The Iron Sea, and even Hopes And Fears. This song is the one diamond, in the pile of coal that is Night Train. (5/5)  Overall, Night Train is not horrible, But when compared to its predecessors, it's noticably weaker.  It's rather hard to believe that this is a Keane release seeing how there's so little of what made Keane great in the first place. I had to judge it on its own merits. And even then it came up just short. Other than, &#34;My Shadow&#34;, and &#34;Your Love&#34;, none of the songs really stand out, and weaker ones, such as &#34;Looking Back&#34; and &#34;Back in Time&#34; just get lost in the crowd. Now, I wasn't exactly thrilled with their album, Perfect Symmetry either, but it was still an enjoyable CD That has a lot more good songs than Night Train does.  Verdict: Would I recommend that you buy this EP? No. At least, not in its entirety. If you want something from it, buy or download, &#34;Back in Time&#34;, &#34;Clear Skies&#34;, &#34;Your Love&#34;,&#34;My Shadow&#34;, and maybe &#34;Stop for a Minute&#34; if you can find the version without the rap verse. download that. As for the version with the rap, as well as the other songs on the EP, steer clear of them. (FINAL SCORE: 3.0/5)  Best Tracks: My Shadow, Your Love Worst Tracks: Looking Back, House Lights, Ishin Denshin  *******UPDATE/AFTERTHOUGHT (7-25-2013)************************************************  I had a thought recently. Do you know what this album reminds me of? (not in terms of content, but in terms of How experimental it was and how people hated it) it reminds a lot of Hot Space by Queen. do any of you remember Hot Space? if you do then you, then you should remember how much Queen Fans shunned Hot Space, and isn't that strikingly similar to how people are treating this EP? That's all I wanted to say, This isn't a change to this review, I still go by everything I stated here, but I just wanted put this thought out there.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|NOTE: Many much better writers than I have written comprehensive reviews on the service, it's clients and how best to use them, so I will focus on the client and our usage of it.<br /><br />I'm a big Evernote supporter and it's used heavily in all aspects of our lives. It's our journal, recipe book, repository of useful personal reference information, business receipts, etc.  Also the service and company seem to actually want you to be able to get access to your data.  Therefore the service I give 5 stars and I highly recommend everyone to give it a spin.<br /><br />The client I'm less enthusiastic about. My biggest complain with the Amazon App Store version is that it is behind by quite a few versions (4.4.2 versus 4.3.5 at the time of this writing), and I frequently have reminders to this effect popping up in my notifications, but once I click on them I'm prompted only to \\"open\\" Evernote.  I believe Evernote could work around this by making their particular client aware of the latest available version on a specific platform. Because of this notification issue I'm only giving the Amazon App Store version of Evernote 4 stars.
0789204096|3.0|Imagine this as a stocking stuffer. They do make a coffee table size of this book which is what I was looking for and thought I had purchased. I was disappointed when I saw how small it was. It was my fault for not looking at the dimensions in the product description. If you are looking for a small book, maybe to put in a larger gift this would be perfect.
B00AECDDYY|3.0|I'm playing this on a first gen Kindle Fire, and it takes a couple of minutes to actually load up. This is blows the point of the simple accessibility and quick fix we've come to expect of tablet and phone games.<br /><br />Once the game is loaded it's quite enjoyable way to kill time. The graphics are not amazing, but I'm not sure that I care. The concept is fun and simple.<br /><br />You get gold at a certain rate, which you can improve by making upgrades to the items that make gold (towns, houses).  When you get 100 gold you can launch a ship which will go out and wreck havoc on the enemy you're playing against. Of course the enemy can as well.  Beyond that initial concept there are bigger ships (500 gold), cannon towers that you can capture and neutral towns ready to be plundered.<br /><br />If they ever fix the load time and don't break the fun of the game in the meantime I'll upgrade this to 5 stars.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Loved this book despite the structure, which at first was very jarring. Nobody likes their story to stop halfway through a thought.
B000SEI230|5.0|One of the most amazing books i have EVER READ!!!!!! The plot was amazing. It was a tear-jerker and a page turner!!! Both the book and movie i would recommend to anyone!!!
1451627289|4.0|For all you Stephen King devotees ( or to borrow King's own appellation, 'constant readers'), this story includes enough King touches to delight. For those who avoid King's works, I encourage you to give this one a read. 'Compelling' is an over-used adjective applied to many novels, but here it is appropriate.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is my wife's favorite movie, so it only made since to buy it on Blu-ray. It was the day before Christmas and she was looking for something to watch on Netflix. I left the room only to return with this! She was ecstatic and couldn't wait to put it in. We plopped in the PS3 and were amazed that such an old movie could look so good in high definition! She even made a comment about Gene Kelly's wrinkles! Overall we were very impressed with the quality and I'm sure she will watch this one over and over!
0062127241|5.0|Pete shares enough insight about his personal life to give the reader some sense of his creative motivations and his creative process. The reader is treated to an intimate discussion of the variety that is glaringly absent from other 'rock star' autobiographies which serve merely to recount hazy memories of destructive Rock N Roll excesses. As one would expect, Pete does include some stories of Keith Moon's excesses but these are told, almost as an aside, as part of the bigger story of the artist, his internal workings, and how the history of the Who was influenced. A most excellent read. Highly recommended to music lovers.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|The Hunger Games is great and when you have finished you are wanting to read the next two books in the series
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A couple months ago, I began reading Fifty Shades of Grey.  My initial reaction after the first 75 pgs. (approx.) was \\"HOLY CRAP, REALLY? I cannot endure 3 volumes of this SOPHMORIC, sexual drivel!\\" AND then, I heard that a movie based on the book was in the works. I was intrigued.  If the book is worthy of a movie, perhaps I should give it another go...<br /><br />In the last 3 weeks, I have completed all 3 volumes. LOVED them and am listing my impressions (likes and dislikes) below.<br /><br />THINGS I LIKED/LOVED IN THIS TRILOGY:<br /><br />THINGS I WAS IRRITATED BY/DIDN'T-LIKE-SO-MUCH IN THIS TRILOGY:<br /><br />1. I got so tired of Anastasia conversationally repeating--almost verbatim--EVERYTHING Christian said, i.e., Christian: \\"Ana, you are everything a man could dream of.\\" Ana's Response: Mr. Grey, you are everything a woman could every dream of.\\" I mean...REALLY? This repetative type of dialog takes mirroring to an almost noxious level. Tends to make the characters seem a bit SIMPLE (AND that is certainly NOT the case in this tale).<br /><br />THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! ! !
B0094BB4TW|5.0|very satisfied, keeps me intouch with family and friends.  Now I'm able to see photos and see how much my grandchild has grown since we don't live too close.
B008XG1X18|5.0|no problems, easy to use, love the view. Thank you! I am so glad this is simple and a great way to save, find, and buy/make things. Love being able to use my Kindle for recipes and crafts I use from Pintrest app!
B001AQR3JY|4.0|My girls love this movie. They want to watch the opening song over and over and over again. It's a family fave.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Gotta admit, the first book was provocative, innovative, interesting, seductive and had the makings of a great, great series, but by the third book, I wanted to shoot both Christian and Anastasia in the face. I can't remember encountering two characters so incredibly vapid and annoying EVER - in literature or any other entertainment medium.<br /><br />I don't know whether to be shocked or frightened about how many thousands of people gave this \\"book\\" five stars and claimed to have \\"read the book over and over again\\" and \\"not want it to end\\". Do these people read anything of substance - EVER?<br /><br />What annoyed me the most was that EVERY...SINGLE...FEMALE the pair encountered was ridiculously, openly, obviously \\"lusting\\" after Christian and EVERY...SINGLE...MALE the pair enountered was ridiculously, openly, obviously \\"lusting\\" after Ana. Come on - give me a break. By the end of the last book, both Christian and Ana seemed so incredibly shallow, immature and completely unfit to be married at such a young age. It is completely unrealistic that a young man who is capable of forming a \\"billion dollar\\" company could be so purile and unsure of his own self.<br /><br />Another annoying thing was Ana's repeated use of the phrase \\"Holy F---\\". Who talks like that? Do people - do young ladies - EDUCATED YOUNG LADIES - really talk like that??? Most of my friends are not what you would call \\"upper crust\\" - some, I have to admit, can be kinda crude, in a funny kinda way - but NONE of them goes around saying \\"Holy F---\\" with such reckless abandon.

B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Don't go out and buy the blue ray. It's worth seeing, but try to watch it for free. It's not worth buying. I rented it on amazon. I wouldn't rent it again. It's just okay.
0345803485|1.0|Gotta admit, the first book was provocative, innovative, interesting, seductive and had the makings of a great, great series, but by the third book, I wanted to shoot both Christian and Anastasia in the face.

It is completely unrealistic that a young man who is capable of forming a \\"billion dollar\\" company could be so purile and unsure of his own self.<br /><br />Another annoying thing was Ana's repeated use of the phrase \\"Holy F---\\". Who talks like that? Do people - do young ladies - EDUCATED YOUNG LADIES - really talk like that???

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book just keeps getting better and better. It's amazing how these characters come alive. And how you see her emotions being in conflict. I hate that part but love these books so far. On to the third!!!!! :)

B0052GACNM|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for a dear friend who loves this type of music. With the duets featuring current pop artists, Tony Bennett effectively crosses over with multi-generational appeal.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun, but the ads in the free version get a little annoying. It's basically a simple time killer. As always, you get what you pay for.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I'm not typically a Jazz fan, but I saw this artist perform on \\"The Colbert Report\\" and enjoyed her music so thought I'd check out the CD & it was awesome.  Diana is a Canadian jazz pianist and singer, who sings interesting lyrics with a smooth voice.  Impressive!
0783240287|2.0|Great music, great story, mostly wonderful presentation, but there is a surprising amount of slutty wardrobes.  Shirtless Donny isn't an issue to me an my family. It is the highly provocative costumes of many females (Potiphar’s wife and dancers around Pharaoh quickly come to mind) makes this inappropriate for families.  Surprisingly provocative for a bible story retelling.  Inappropriately so.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Good collection. For Kindle, I would prefer slightly larger typeface. Good original illustrations. Amazon, why do you ask for an annoying soliloquy about these books. I find it more annoying than the review requests!
0525951113|5.0|This was an awesome book recommended to me by a friend in Germany.  In a word it is absolutely phenomenal.  A modern day tech thriller that would satisfy any action movie junk or your run of the mill computer nerd.  The scary part is how feasible a Dameon truly is based on the concepts/ideas presented in the book.  It was well researched and had plenty of twists and turns that kept me from wanting to put it down.  In a word this book has renewed my interest in fiction since the passing of Mr. Crichton!
B0082P6V1W|5.0|It is very insightful and knowledgable. It is now very clear to me how we came about, as well as all other species.
0060873027|3.0|This book was a bit of a disappointment.  While I could not distinguish what had been written by Preston vs Michael, it just did not feel the same.  It was not as heavily researched as Crichton fans are used to, and just had a it's been done feeling (ie: Fantastic Voyage).  It would make a good movie I think, but as a book it was a bit of a let down.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love all the harry potter movies, i bought this dvd on black friday for cheap! Great buy, love it.
B000U1ZV44|3.0|blu-ray version of this film is lacking, not worth the money if you have it on dvd already.  The film is good and is one of my favorites for the Halloween season but nothing was visually worth the blu-ray price tag.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I was expecting a &#34;Bourne&#34; movie and that is not what this movie is. They talk about Jason Bourne but that is about it and only a little of that even. This was an entirely different movie. Very disappointing as I love the Bourne movies.
B003Y5H5B0|1.0|i thought that the dvd would be quality but i was wrong the dvd has scratches and scuffs i can't wipe off, dvd skips and jumps and i can not fix it, very upset with the quality.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game it's cool and fun.I've been playing this since I was little girl and also relaxing I play this game on my free time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book due to the fact that a medical doctor, one that knows how the brain really works, that a skeptic, a scientist,  and though he had such a difficult time which I would never wish on anyone, I thank him for his courage in this amazing journey he has shared with me.<br /> I highly recommend this book which I find as a NDE adventurer myself, as well as an intuitive empath that I believe this to be the absolute truth.  I highly recommend this book due to Science vs spirit.
B00514HDNW|5.0|This was an amazing book. It read fast and captured my attention from the beginning. I could not put this book down.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I can't wait for Season 7 to be on DVD - huge fan of Dexter - too bad I have to wait for it to come out on DVD
B000VMFDW2|5.0|EB Sledge has written a great book about a Marine's account in WWII Pacific as taken from his personal diary.  A greta red about the tragedy of war, including the loss of human life.  It is also an excellent history of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Pacific.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book, best of the the three.  The story of Ana and Christian and their love for each other is never ending. It teaches us Never to judge a book from it's cover because you never know what's really inside.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I am one of those people who are reluctant to get into the books that everyone else is reading at the time. But I must say I really did enjoy this book. After the first few chapters I couldn't put it down. Now I'm going to buy the other two books on my kindle and read them this week!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I think I enjoyed the first one better than this one. There seemed to be way to much of the same dialogue going on through the games that made it kinda boring to read. Other than that it wasn't a bad read.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|One of those movies that seemed like a total disaster but it turned out to be quite a fun ride.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good book that I read in about three days very easy to get involved with. Definitely recommend
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|A movie where I thought I was gonna see Liam Neeson fight wolves.  That disappointment aside, this film was truly great.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Grandson recommended this book.  Found it too difficult to follow.  The transitions were great. Many friends found it a 'great' read.
B003498SDA|5.0|eXCELLENT FILM ITS A GOOD MOVIE WITH GOOD ACTORS AND A GOOD STORY. i LIKED IT ALOT.  wAS wILL SMITHS WIFE IN IT?
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|glad i down load it fun and awsome i gave it 5 out of 5 grate gameu shoud down load and play it for yourself
1407130366|5.0|Well written. good enough for adults. Not just for young adults. Thank you for the wonderful journey. I loved it.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Really... I guess it's for those who may need it badly. I didn't! But I'll admit that I did mentally checked myself off on  stuff I did to break the ice in nervous situations. But advise given in this book is nothing new.
1449410243|4.0|Gave as xmas gift.  She seemed to be having fun with it as, of course, I gave to a cat lover.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought The Hunger Games was absolutely fantastic.  I couldn't put it down I always had to have it with me,  I loved it.
030758836X|4.0|I loved every page of this book and couldn't put it down -- but I felt like I was dropped off a cliff at the ending.  Very unsatisfied.  It was almost as if the author was wrapping up the story and then remembered that she left her baby in the tub unsupervised.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian held me spellbound from the first chapter to the last. I read it in one sitting; something I haven't done in years. I look forward to reading additional books by this author.
B0091REZMW|4.0|super fun! Recommend for 6 &amp; up, one bad thing is the quest are super short and sometimes the game is slow.:l
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|A pleasant little fairytale... but not up to the Pixar standard. The moral was a little vague. Plenty of smiles though.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Great sci-fi flick, really keeps the atmosphere of the original \\"Alien\\" alive. Great special effects.<br /><br />Only problem I had was for the life of me, I can't figure out why that advanced being at the beginning swallows that evil black goop in the first place.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Faber the spy becomes a fascinating figure as Follett builds tension and pace. At night, I would replay scenes and wonder at the craft. I was occasionally bothered by improbable plot turns and technical details, like swimming half a mile in regular clothes across a stretch of the North Sea, but they didn't stop me from wondering what Faber (or Follett) would come up with next.
B000JQUMPI|1.0|zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z  zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z  z z z  z z z z zz
B007UXSPK2|2.0|We were looking for an action movie and at least it filled that need, however, it wasn't a particularly good action movie.  The technology was dorky and the story line was confusing and not very compelling.  Mission Impossible #1 is still the best of this franchise.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is an addictive game and it is one of my favorites.  It did take a little while to get used to the controls, but after you get the hang of it you can play for hours.  I have had one or two times where I had to force close it (as others noted) but nothing too frustrating.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I bought this book after watching the movie &#34;Fat Head&#34; a response documentary to the ever popular &#34;Super Size Me&#34; and I was intrigued by the idea. I read it and wanted to give it a go because it made sense to me. I was talking about this idea with my dad and encouraged him to read it after finding out that he had a recurring problem with bleeding in his stomach. He tried following the ideas in this book for a week, a recommended time that people usually need to feel any effects to see if you have gluten sensitivity, and it was night and day. My father who was feeling under the weather running into health complications at a steadier pace he was better. He was happier and as of now he has lost maybe 20lbs.<br /><br /> This isn't a review saying &#34;OMG do this and you will lose weight&#34; because I know that I didn't lose 20lbs eating gluten free. I just feel much better, I can actually run longer the I ever could even when I wasn't overweight and I don't run as part of my routine.<br /><br /> It is a well written book, that brings up facts that have been researched and isn't trying to sell you some expensive product aka a juicer. It is just giving you information and asking &#34;why don't you give it a try and if it doesn't work that is fine.&#34;
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|My husband I enjoyed the first two movies in this trilogy, but The Dark Knight Rises was a disappointment. Too many characters, too long, and heavy in the middle, the movie left me frustrated even though the ending was &#34;happy&#34;.  I could have watched only the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes and been more satisfied with the experience.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really loved the first book and felt okay with the second book. In fact I liked the first book much more than the movie because it explained a lot of things that were kind of confusing. I think that it is well written grammatically and it had wonderful word choice, but I just couldn't finish this series.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-------------Don't Read this Because it Might Be Spoiler------------------------<br /><br /> I will say I didn't like it, but I understood when a lot of main characters started dying because hey there is a war happening in this book and people die, so get over it. The characters were all done pretty well....except for the main character. She seemed to be constantly be the exception to the rules of morality to prove how superior she was. She became increasingly irritating because of this fact. Everyone else was wonderful, but the main character.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This book might just not have been for me, so I won't knock anyone for trying it.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This movie had a much slower start than the original Bourne movies. Still, follows story line pretty well. Definitely worth it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I purchased this book based on the reviews.  I am a streaky reader.  I'll read a bunch of Sci-Fi and then move to historical drama and then to Biographies and then to baseball.  I've read and loved all of the Wool series and am eagerly awaiting Third Shift.  This book jumped out at me and I bought it figuring it would be a nice little read until something jumped out at me.  I had just finished Pillars of the Earth and needed a break so I jumped into my Sci-Fi mode.  This book was not a nice little break, it was a tremendous read and now I've added Mr. Weir to my must read list.<br /><br />I was believing that the author must have been an astronaut prior to becoming an author with the detail he put behind the technology and strategies of a Mars landing, life on Mars, the return trip and all of the trials and tribulations that the main character faces in his time alone on Mars.  This may scare some people away, but don't the detail is what is needed.  He vividly describes the problem, why it happened and then steers the character through a very viable and believable solution.  An average author could not have pulled this book off to the degree that Mr. Weir did.<br /><br />The bouncing around between the daily (SOL) log book and the characters on Earth who are working out solutions to help bring the main character back home are done very smoothly.  The prospect of reading a log book gave me reservation.  The entries in the log book were thorough, filled with sarcasm, humor and spirit.  It would exactly be how I would have approached entries in my log book had I been stranded on Mars.  With no one to talk with, the absurdity of my situation and in the remote hopes that someone would actually read this log book someday, you wouldn't pull any punches.<br /><br />A strong 5 star rating for this book.  For those of you who complain about grammar, spelling or punctuation errors in an e-book, get over it.  Look past these issues and appreciate the genius of this writer and be thankful that at $0.99, you can read high quality material such as, \\"The Martian\\"<br /><br />I'll be reading more Mr. Weir.  Keep up the great work!
1616614609|5.0|I played the original NetRunner CCG back in the day. I didn't play it for super long, but I really enjoyed it while I played it. I was nervous about playing it again because I figured it wouldn't hold up to modern games, but it turns out it was ahead of its time.<br /><br />For the most part I had forgotten all of the rules from my previous times playing it, but the rules in this edition have been cleaned up, and made more elegant. The manual also includes a fair amount of examples and clarifications.<br /><br />The flavor of this game is done very well, and it fits nicely with the mechanics. As a software developer I can appreciate some of the references that are made in the game.<br /><br />The game, like many CCGs where it originally came from, can sometimes be won or lost by one of the players having a lot of bad draws. The nice part about it losing the CCG format is this happens less. However, it can still occur, but since the game usually runs 30 minutes you're not out too much, and you can just try again.<br /><br />The best part of the game is the tension. Sometimes, especially if you're playing the evil corporation, the tension can get so high that you'll actually feel your heart race as you hope the other player doesn't exploit a weakness. This feeling comes from the fact that you will have hidden information from that player, and he must do his best to prepare before venturing into the unknown. I've found that as the hacker you tend to feel this level of tension less, but you'll still have a lot of fun.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Make watching this movie a Christmas tradition in your home after trimming your own tree!  Hilarious from start to conclusion.  Fun for all ages.  Every family should have a copy.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Feels like reading a variation of Harry Potter with more of a love interest.  A good read if you enjoy this genre
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A light, easy read purely for entertainment. I've already checked out and started reading the next title in the series.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|A very good book well and truly up to Tom Clancy standard  how soon before the next book is due out.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|What is it, 40 years later? There are bits of Moby Dick the novel here, but really it is pure Hollywood, near its formulaic best. What's great is the mighty trio of Shaw, Benjamin, and Scheider, well beyond formulas.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|A new hero in this series is not a problem. Great action, acting and non stop chase scenes! If you like action you will enjoy this film.
145210655X|5.0|My brother loved this book!  Him and his son will enjoy it together!  My favorite page is &#34;This is not the toy you are looking for&#34;  Hilarious!!
031603441X|4.0|This was given as a gift to a Stones and Keith Richards fan, who thoroughly enjoyed receiving and reading it.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I can not get my son to put this game down.  Some people complain about getting it set up and it falling but if you have played the phone version, it doesn't matter to the children. As long as they can swing a bird to knock ANYTHING down they are satisfied!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Kids love to play. I haven't tried it yet, but will let you know. I hate that I have to add more descriptive words.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book!! I'm not a huge reader but I couldn't put the book down! I read it within a week and starting book two
159420411X|5.0|This book arrived promptly and in perfect condition - my husband is very excited to read it. It's great to get hardcover books at soft-cover prices.
B0033YAU3M|1.0|This was NOT what arrived, and I had to return it---instead, a children's version of Sherlock Holmes with cartoonish characters on the cover was delivered to my door. When I called Amazon they were extremely helpful, however the only comparable editions of this book available for purchase were 3 times the price. Consequently, I ended up purchasing another gift for my son-in-law.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I was looking for a backpack for a Christmas present (the recipient's old one was ripping at the bottom) and found this on Amazon. It was exactly as advertised, so no bait and switch or damaged/worn out parts; arrived in time for Christmas despite holiday shipping delays (I ordered it about a week and a half before it arrived); and now the giftee is very happy with the purchase. 5 stars!
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's free lol fun for a little...  steel cool game to play on the run. My kids like it. That's y I gave it 4 stars
B0053TMP24|4.0|If I were to recommend this book I would recommend it to people who are interested in Greek mythology and Roman mythology
B004AQR29C|5.0|It is great to see all of these 'old' stars together in one film.  Action packed and fun to watch.  We watched Expendables 2 right after this and it was great too!

B005STGJDA|5.0|I love this album and it came perfectly new! Get it. Seriously. Get it. Now. Why are you still waiting? Add it to your cart!
B0040UAYI4|1.0|If you are looking for a mouse and keyboard for BF3 buy the pc version of the game. this item stinks with BF3. works with other shooters well but who plays anything other the BF3 at the moment. COD is the same as the las 3 versions and beatable in a single day.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I love Josh Groban and this is his best CD to date.  &#34;Awake&#34; was the song we played at our wedding so its very memorable for me.  A must have for any Josh Groban fan.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Didn't think I would like this movie but as it turns out has become one of my favorites. The acting was great as the music and of course Brad Pitt was great.
B009C7JS14|5.0|very easy to read.  very helpful -good to have a weather report when you ar e on the go. easy to understand
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne was going to be such an amazing writer. This book is filled with such passion and soul. It just breaks my heart that such a beautiful young women had to die that way.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Doctor who is a great series.  Now I did have some reservations with Matt being the new doctor.<br />As I was being open minded and didnt take long for me to like his version of the doctor.
B007HO392S|5.0|I Love Carrie Underwood, so its almost a given I would love this new CD, but I think all of the songs are great and I definitly enjoy listening to this CD
B005M2A4DE|5.0|How can you not like this series. Matt smith does a great job as the doctor.<br />For me and this series the first two episodes and the last ..........WOW
B001JNNDEW|5.0|This movie is an absolute classic and a must watch. I think anyone and everyone can relate to this movie and their own work environment, it is such a comical movie and you will remember things about it for years to come. Great buy!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a unique and very creative game that is fun for both parents and kids.<br />While I did get it while it was Amazons free app of the day, I feel $1.99 is very reasonable.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele, I think all of the songs on this CD are worth listening to and this CD is a great buy!
B009HELT3C|4.0|We rented this movie based on the reviews, and at first it seemed like it was kind of a dud. But after they set up the storyline, it really takes off! Very enjoyable!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I totally fell in love with Dexter after the first episode, I definitly recommend this show for anyone and everyone! Very entertaining!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Would not have expecting the ending at all I love the book and I can't wait to see what the movie offers.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|After just one show of Dexter I was hooked! Every season seems to get more and more interesting. I love this season and this show!
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I have been at the begining of this game for at least an hour. There is no clue button and no talking to help you out I have no idea what I am looking for. Does any know. So far this game pretty much stinks for me so not worth paying for
B000V86OKG|5.0|I am a BIG Dexter fan and absolutely LOVE this season, definitly worth buying and watching. I watch it while I work out and my workouts definitly fly by with this show!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book I read it in 4 days! I choose it because I loved the movie but the book is 100 times better
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Lots of fun and challenging. Very cute! I would recommend this game to anyone! Whoever came up with this is genius. :)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent  story. Reminds me of the . MaCGyver series and speaks of the tenacity of the human spirit. thanks all
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Great game that requires actual strategy and logic in comparison to Angry Birds! Good follow-up game and cool side-story to the Angry Birds franchise.
B0055S348W|5.0|This was very easy to install and use.  I love that it makes it simple to print everything I want and need.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Not the usual court room drama ,though still involves the lawyer.the suspense is high throughout and enough twists to keep one hooked to the finish of the book.the ending is superb and leaves one feeling good .
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you enjoy the game of Solitaire, this app will definitely give you hours of ejoyment.  I give it an A!
B005OKTPKC|4.0|It's a good book to read while traveling and sitting relaxed.good suspense and flow.there is no one to beat Grisham when it comes to court room drama
B004GYY714|2.0|I admit that I am not computer literate so my problems probably begin and end of me.  If someone else can help me to run the app, I would greatly appreciate it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was almost impossible to put down.  Futuristic, action filled, social commentary and young love.  What more could you ask for?
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this app and would definitely buy it again!  If you are a fan of Mahjong, you will enjoy the puzzles.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|Raunchy take on the romantic comedy Ted is a three way love affair between Whalberg, Kunis, and his childhood bear Ted.  Too risque for kids yet this movie has the nostalgic appeal of a family movie.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|They have outdone themselves. This is awesome. They worked on it for a long time and its well worth the wait.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not stop reading! Once I started the first book, I had to keep reading. It made my 5 hour flight seem like only an hour.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I liked the book, read it in one night. I agree with some that the first half is barely enough to keep you interested but it really picks up. I was confused about how she was at holders house and recognized it when they had lived next door to each other in a different city? Obviously I missed something.<br />I think the characters are well developed, holder seems a bit mature for an 18 year old. Would have pinned him closer to 30!
B002YCVX5S|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie. Had some trouble getting it to load on Amazon Instant Video, but once we got it working, we really liked it.
0061120081|3.0|I thought I was purchasing the book to download onto the Kindle. My daughter told me it would be the actual book. I have thought of returning it, but I may keep it and read it the old-fashioned way. My grandsons like the book also and i may pass it on to them.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Someone I live with loves this movie. I thought it seemed alright. We didn't watch it to the end, though.
B0038W0OIK|4.0|I bought two of these headsets a year or so ago when I decided to start gaming again and then gifted the other to my boyfriend.  My previous headset was a SteelSeries 5H that I received as a Christmas gift.  I really like the fact that these headsets come apart because I always seem to be on the go and it fits well into my bag when it's separated.  I also really like the retractable mic so it doesn't get damaged when not in use.<br /><br />The first headset worked well straight out of the box.  The other's retractable mic was pinched and wouldn't extend completely so I had to exchange it through Amazon (no trouble there).  The 3rd arrived a few days later and worked as expected.<br /><br />The sound quality for gaming is better than any of the cheap headsets I used in the past and everyone tells me that the microphone is crystal clear.  I also love that I can mute the mic and adjust the volume.  I'm no audiophile so I'm probably not a really good judge of sound quality.  They get the job done and music sounds decent, as well.  If you want more specifics, there are a few other reviews that have that.<br /><br />Fast forward 2 years and the headsets are still working.  There was a problem with the sound cutting in and out on the left side of mine after about 8 months.  I contacted SteelSeries who said it was likely related to the cord (a short or something, even despite the braiding, which I like) and they quickly sent me a new one which fixed the problem (apparently this is common).  The other headset is just now starting to act up -- it appears that the connection to the earpiece is a little loose so the microphone stops working occasionally.  Wiggling the connection forward seems to fix the issue temporarily.  After 2 year's worth of gaming on each, I'd say they've held up very well.  My boyfriend-now-husband's head is fairly large and he never had an issue with adjusting the size or had the middle piece crack.<br /><br />Overall, good quality gaming headset and I'll probably buy SteelSeries again in the future.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis are a great team, providing catchy tunes to dance to such at Thrift Shop, White Walls,and Cowboy Boots as well as more serious songs to nod to such as Same Love, Wing$, and A Wake, that tackle real issues in America today and make you reflect on your views.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Great writing, modest yet intriguing plot line, a few strange (too strange) story lines however. Love the main character, who does a successful job of leading readers through the events of his life,whether they be mundane or important.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the graphics & the sounds.  It is very easy to play.  It feels like playing real card game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan brings another wonderful tale of the seven demigods with twists and turns on every page. You won't want to put this book down no matter your age.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This book is fullk of great twists and very readable. Unusual reason for greed. The first I have read this kind of plot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is absolutely breathtaking from the first sentence to the last word. The author has such a brilliant way with words and has you consistently on the edge waiting for more. This book had me bawling my eyes out by the end. It is a absolute must read, no doubt.
B0058VW36U|5.0|you should get it. you can change the candy by tapping it in the main screen and there's 3 season's that you can choose from.... I high my recommend this app....  om nom (the cute monster ) dies too.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought this headset for my fiance and I end up using it most of the time when we play games. The sound is great! I was concerned about the fit since we both wear glasses, but the headset is really comfortable. The range is amazing; we can pause a game, walk to the kitchen to get something to drink and keep talking to people. I highly recommend this headset!
B009E3EY38|5.0|You need to have this version of the concert so you can enjoy the audio experience on the go and have the stunning blue ray presentation for your home theater. Best live version of whole Lotta love ever(even tops the song remains the same concert).
B000T46NOE|4.0|Another comic book turned into a movie . . . another amazingly good movie.  Lots of schtick but good action, an actual story, and some nice effects.  Definitely worth watching.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|it was so great i couldn't put the book down. i stood up all night reading it. i fell in love with the characters and the book's way of explaining every thing through the eyes of Charily.
B00631VJIC|4.0|I bought this CD because I really enjoy the music that is showcased on the show.  I was not dissapointed.  The selection has many of the best from the seasons and I plan to order the second disc as well.
B0049985XW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the excellent storytelling, the thrilling moments, the dark comedy.  What shines here are the actors, especially Bogart, who's performance is actually distressing.  As a character, his descent is so chilling you pity him as you are repulsed.  While the message is an old one (greed can consume), this film gives it a new impact.
159413586X|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite of the trilogy.  It definitely brings it all together and wraps it up nicely, leaving no questions for the readers.  Suzanne Collins does justice by most characters and let's the readers feel satisfied that all is good again.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Manages to be comedic while containing real heart.  It's humor is balanced by it's tug on the heartstrings.  It is a good example of that makes Pixar a master of storytelling.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the year's best!  How can you go wrong with multiple superheros battling such a great villian as Loki?  There's plenty of action throughout the movie and some great comedy as well.  I highly recomment this movie for everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loves this book I would recommend it to anyone, it was so exciting. It all seemed real as if you were really in the games.
1594135851|5.0|This is my favorite book of the trilogy.  Katniss must emerge from the Games once again to protect her family and those she loves.  Interesting with plenty of twists to keep you guessing.
B00005ATFN|1.0|Maybe I don't understand what [Region 2] means.. but this DVD will not play in our players.  We tried it in our XBox, and 2 other DVD players.  Very disappointed, a non working Christmas present.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|How can you go wrong when you bring together two of the greatest forms of entertainment ever?  It's an epic adventure like only Angry Birds and the Force can deliver . . .
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I first heard this song in a commercial (can't remember which one) and I immediately loved it. Cold Play is great!!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|We rented this on New Year's Eve thinking it was something we had wanted to see in the theaters but had missed.  It was nothing like we expected it to be.  I enjoyed the movie however it was indeed strange.
B00906J7KO|5.0|My grandbabies love it! It was good to continue the saga of our little Chihuhua.  They were great!  I might buy another for my other grandbabies.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|. . . that's how bad it was.  Special effects sucked, story wasn't any good and even Sam Worthington couldn't save this movie from drowning.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Must readd! Loved this and the ending was just so surprising! This is definitely not a waste, it's an amazing novel!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|What is it about Kristin Stewart that is so annoying?  She's just always making that same face in every movie.  Charlize Theron and Chris Helmsworth do a superb job in this flick, making it worth watching.
B005K17RU0|5.0|no issues so far- just weather info when I need it!  The app was very easy for me to navigate and to view other locations. I like that my local weather is an ongoing notification now.
B009329ZF2|3.0|This movie was OK.  Action sequences were good but lacked a real story - such as why we were being attacked.  Great visual effects, ala Transformers, but no real purpose behind them.
