B008B37CB8|5.0|Freak Out is somewhat of an oddity, now and at the time it was released. It was the first album released on two vinyl LPs, unheard-of at the time, and it didn't make much musical sense nor much of a dent in the musical scene at the time. Some of the featured instruments on the album is the kazoo and xylophone. The kazoo was featured on some of the jug bands at the time, such as the Lovin Spoonful, but this is probably the ONLY rock album to feature a xylophone. If the album seems out there now, you can imagine how it appeared in 1966 when it was released. It is, however, a mature finely construct musical work.<br /><br />It's a very eclectic album, containing renditions in do-wop, pop, blues rock and musique concrete, but is also the first concept album, but it is an eclectic album that works. It is easier to appreciate this distinction on the vinyl release rather on the CD feature.<br /><br />It is the first politically conscious album. It had its share of pop songs, but many songs are tinged with political angst and foreboding. The title of one song, \\"Who Are the Brain Police?\\" is a dead giveaway.<br /><br />Political statements can be read into other songs such as \\"Anywhere the Wind Blows\\" and \\"Trouble Every Day.\\" \\"Trouble Every Day\\" reportedly was written by Zappa after watching the Watts Riots on television. \\"Trouble Every Day\\" received a lot of FM airplay in the day, due not only to its blues progressions, but on account of his statement, controversial then and now, \\" I'm not black, but there's a whole lots a times I wish I could say I'm not white.\\" This line played very well in the 60s.<br /><br />\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" is another interesting song with political undertones. Zappa took the title from a novel written by Upton Sinclair of the same name. The theme of the novel was the take-over of fascist interests in the United States. The song echos the same concern. Zappa deconstructs that most American of musical art forms, the barbershop quartet, by camping up the musical counterparts and singing, \\"it Can't Happen Here,\\" as if it was Zappa's way of saying, \\"Yes, it CAN happen here.\\"<br />Zappa not only criticized the political establishment and society, but shared criticisms of other pop songs. \\"Help, I'm a Rock,\\" is a satire of the then-recently released \\"I am a Rock,\\" from Simon and Garfunkle.  The near complete lack of musical structure in the song or anything resembling \\"singing\\" is a satire on the smooth measured melodies of the S & G song.<br /><br />The insanity level of the album increases as the album progresses. By the time of the last \\"song,\\" \\"The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet,\\" all bets were off. Urban legend has it that producer Tom Wilson and most of the Mothers -- but not Zappa -- were under the influence of LSD while recording this particular song. Whether or not this is true, this is truly plausible when one listens to this song. It is the \\"freak out,\\" referenced to in the title.<br /><br />This album gets better with passing time. The songs more urgent and its overall structure and what Zappa was hoping to achieve more apparent. In many ways, this album was Zappa's musical statement of what he wanted to achieve in his musical goals. It is his definitive work. It is definitely worth a listen.up the musical counterparts and singing, \\"it Can't Happen Here,\\" as if it was Zappa's way of saying, \\"Yes, it CAN happen here.\\"<br />Zappa not only criticized the political establishment and society, but shared criticisms of other pop songs. \\"Help, I'm a Rock,\\" is a satire of the then-recently released \\"I am a Rock,\\" from Simon and Garfunkle.

B00BF123WG|5.0|I missed this in the theatres, and looked forward to watching at home.  It was worth the wait.  Alot of back story really helps this all come together, and the pivotal moment is down played.  Not as violent as I would have thought.  Enjoyable.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love Diamond Dash & played it on Facebook for a couple of years & I'm glad to see it formatted for smart phones!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Would recommend to anyone.  Do not need to know the game first as cards move easy and slow enough to understand.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|This is so easy to follow. The book is short and to the point. Written in Plain English with no silly complicated formulas to remember. Will definitely be able to stick to this.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I got this book purely out of curiosity, as there had been so much talk about it. Maybe its my age, its not for me.
1616550414|5.0|This book is wonderful for anyone who love the Zelda series. It gives a complete timeline and has many of the spec drawings of characters. I found it very interesting how the characters changed over time. Highly recommend

1451629192|5.0|A Stolen Life is a really amazing book! I really liked it a lot. I would recommend this book to people who love to read mysteries or about real life about people's life. If I rated this book I would give it a 5 star.<br />  I'm going to tell you a little bit about the book. Well this book is about a girl named Jaycee Dugard she got stolen from a woman named Nancy and her husband named Phillip Garrida. They stole her when she was only 11 years old and she couldn't speak her own name. She was stolen for 18 years. This book took place in 1991.<br /><br />  By:<br />  Vanessa
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This item got nothing but raves, and has been watched many, many times<br />Good price and being enjoyed<br /><br />Thank you, Jane
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Good movie. All told in narration form by daughter. Dealing with issues others can probably relate to. Worth seeing. SAD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this game is a very good game to play and I say that a lot more people should play this game as it is very entertaining
B0088TG252|5.0|Great movie...I enjoyed the entire story line. It felt real.  Denzel is alway a great grab for a hot movie as such
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app! From the bible readings, to the easy search for chapters and verse, to the different bible versions, this app is truly easy to use. I'm glad that I was able to find it.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|The true story told  from the guts of the MCC.<br /><br />If anybody still have doubts about  the conquest of the Moon just read this Gene Kranz's masterpiece
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Great dvd, will be watched many times over.<br />It was received in excellent condition.and was a gift and well accepted.
B0060MYK7G|2.0|I have already received two sets and all are defective. There is a white line running on the top of the screen and it is on all the disk's. . I email and get no results. Who wants to keep sending DVD's back that are defective and no one will even check there stock. I have already received two sets and all are defective.<br /><br />I wish someone at Amazon would take the time and view these DVD's, then they would see what the problem is.
B00APAENUI|4.0|This edition of Weber's Honor Harrington was alright. It held my attention, and was readable, and delivered a decent scifi adventure.<br /><br />I am a little fatigued by Honor as a character, especially so in this book. Harrington is lord on Grayson, which is an extremely religious planet. My fatigue comes in because it seems Honor can do no wrong. She is denounced as a lord for being a woman, and there is a bloc in the Grayson government against her. She avoids assassins, and expects people to accept her. The Graysons even make her an admiral! Granted, she did save them in Honor of the Queen, but Weber seems to make Honor out to be this total naval genius, so much so a foreign navy makes her one of their highest ranking officers.<br /><br />In conclusion, Flag in Exile is not an awful book itself, but Honor's character is a bit too much for someone who has read the previous books.
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is okay not the best in the world but good i play it quite a bit and I like the  little goblins that are around the house even though it costs stuff to get them to go away
B00BHMF578|3.0|A great story and we could have learned more about the 6 Americans but instead we get Ben Affleck brooding about something or other with a few scenes that go nowhere. Affleck could have been a good actor but you couldn't tell from this film. He can neither show fear, sadness, anxiety, joy, excitement or any of the other human emotions people have from time to time. He remains this aloof menopausal James Bond character whose only acting dimension is to look sullen and forelorn. When he speaks he mumbles. If you really are out to save six people one should get fired up about it and thereby instill some hope and life in the people he is rescuing. Naturally John Goodman and Alan Arkin breath some life into this film with some good scripting and acting but they couldn't carry the whole show. Mr. Affleck continues to be a one dimensional actor taking his cue from the old Charles Bronson movies. I wanted to know more about the six Americans and how they got separated from the Embassy and what was going on with their lives, their hopes, their dreams and their struggles. There could have been some real drama portrayed there but they never got the chance. They had to be very important else why would so many do so much for so few?
B00APPMB9I|5.0|Takes you on a wild ride - I love this movie...it has become one that I've added to my list of &#34;Classics.&#34;
B005F3XV7Q|5.0|Great family dvd, watched many times over.<br />Arrived in excellent condition and very well priced<br />Thank you for such a wonderful item.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|I loved The Shield at the beginning, it was edgy and dark. 10 years later it's not, Vic is silly and bombastic.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I would like to read the Bible on my own and not have to sign in to YouVersion.com<br />I would like to be unrestricted in what I want to read.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this particular SHERLOCK .  I love his character and his sidekick Watson...  The plots are not so gorgy and the way his<br />mind works is great..  If only the references to homosexuality could be omited...Those hints are not needed in this show.. It really is a great show.  Hope season 3 comes out soon...
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a fantastic app.<br />I check it all the time!<br />Can even set it for other areas, perhaps where you are visiting & etc.
142314189X|5.0|This item was a gift, and upon receiving it the person said it was more beautiful then expectedl.<br />So thank you for describing it as it was in great detail.<br />Thank you also for fast shipping.<br />Jane
B008PZYZH6|5.0|Had a great time with the family watching this movie. The picture and sound quality was great. Hope to enjoy more movies with the family.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm glad I purchased this also. I think I have gotten more on my Kindle for grandchildren than for myself. Thanks again Amazon.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Thougt it would be a another series that tried to use green arrow and not succeed .But I was surprised at how good it actually turned out.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Either I don't get it or I'm missing out because I got bored. Need some directions. Or hints. I played for almost a week and then got rid of it.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|A gift for a very special child.  Arrived in excellent condition and price was excellent.<br />Is being watched over and over.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|Got this item way faster than expected. I thought it was gonna be more than 6 episodes though I don't think I would have ordered it had a I known I was only getting 6 episodes.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is another game that will keep a child entertained for hours if you let them.  especially good for waiting rooms .
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Works amazingly well. Just like other 5 star reviewers said. It's fast and works great on my macbook retina display.
0307951529|5.0|This is on my line of thinking. I always say that I don't &#34;conform&#34; to others way of life. I don't keep up with the &#34;Jones'es&#34; and Oh, yeah, When in Rome? Think about this: Jesus never went to Rome, but if He had - He definitely wouldn't have done what the Romans were doing. There's nothing wrong with living life free. It's our God-given right to freedom!<br />I got this book to pick up on some pointers for having success. You don't have to punch a time clock to make a living and there's nothing wrong with working for a company - if that's what you like to do. I haven't finished the book yet, but so far I like what I've read. If you're looking for a different way of life and &#34;making it&#34; in this world - this book is a great starting place on your road to freedom! Keep up the great works of literature Chris!
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great item, good pricing, no need to do comparison, Item was as expected and very much appreciated.<br />Thank you<br />Jane
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I missed this series on television.  Someone recommended it to me.  I didn't think this would be a show I would enjoy considering it takes place in the early 1900's.  After watching the first couple of episodes I quickly became addicted.  Just had to get the rest of the seasons.  I watch this through roku and the picture quality is excellent.  I also like watching several episodes in a row.  Beats waiting a week for the next episode to come.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm not much on games like this but my grandchildren love it. I don't let them play all the time but when it's nasty outside and they 're couped up inside it keeps their attention.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A bit futuristic but that was the plot.  It's a better way to bring us to the future than those monsters movies.
1400069289|5.0|Yeah, I see there are a few naysayers, but that's a good thing.  The reviews are highly polarized with a HUGE skewing to 5-star ratings.  Even the 1-star reviews say the first couple chapters are great (and the appendix is important too).<br /><br />It's a top-10 book in my opinion.<br />* The language is great. The prose: it flows!<br />* Built on Stories and anecdotes that are easier to remember.<br />* Well structured to keep your interest.<br />* The information is actionable.<br /><br />The book does seem to drop off at the end.  I guess it's a curse from being a journalist (see: inverted pyramid).  However, the Appendix is a guide that you'll come back to if you're serious about changing or creating a (personal) habit.<br /><br />So, in conclusion...<br /><br />If you read the one star reviews and are worried, then borrow the book from a friend (cajole them into buying a copy if you have to).  Or buy the book used and pass it around like cigarettes in prison.<br /><br />But it's worth the read.
B003UESJFG|5.0|A great family dvd, it will be enjoyed many times over.<br />Excellent product with excellent price.<br />Thank you for such a wonderful item.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I found the book very lovely and highly recommend it. The garden hiding those secrets and being beautiful was tops.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like this game pretty good. You can learn as you go. Grandchildren love it . It keeps their attention and they don't find it to hard to do.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|It reminds me of the Reader's Digest stories short but OK. I read a few of Michael Connelly's books and was a bit disapointed in this one.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|This is definitely on my top 10 movie list! Matthew McConaughey effortlessly captures Dirk Pitt's charisma and bravado, and never has there been a more perennial movie sidekick than Steve Zahn, a perfect Al Giordino. I can't read a Dirk Pitt novel now without picturing William H. Macy as Sandecker. And Penelope Cruz's Eva Rojas is able to stand toe-to-toe with Dirk each step of the way. But a perfect cast is only part of the brilliance of this movie. The African landscape paired with Clint Mansell's score effortlessly pull you in, from the ride up the Niger to the final battle in the desert. A great watch for Clive Cussler fans as well as those just looking for a good time!<br /><br />Side note: As a fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels, I would love to throttle whoever it was that started that stupid Sahara lawsuit. It is an absolute crime to not make more movies out of those novels.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love the sparkle pets and IOVE the purple hound dog. My friend is so mad at me because I am on the last hound dog and he's only on the 2nd hound dog. IN OUR FASE,,DREAM TOWN! I DON'T LIKE YOU!!!!!!!!!!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The power of habit is an excellent book. It is written well and is very insightful. However at times some of hs points just seem too obvious when he blatantly tries to throw you off guard. Its a good book for people who want to change something in their lives or community. The recipe for changing habit is simple and seems very effective.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I like this game myself. The only thing I have against this game is that the cube faces stay the same. I think you should have some options on the cube faces.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Loved this story as much as I loved the Lincoln Lawyer and when I saw the movie with Matthew McConaughey it made me appreciate this actor.  Wish there was a serie on TV.
B008L40Q7E|5.0|I haven't read the James Bond novel, since the late 60's.  Ian Fleming is a great writer.  I have just started reading the James Bond novels again.  You don't get the full enjoyment of seeing the TV versions, especially when Bond is being portrayed by so many actors now.  The best James Bond actor, was Sean Connery.  Keep them coming.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I loved the book and Rick  is my favorite author ever and  I can't wait for the new book Hose of Hades!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Great movie with a compelling and an unusual (meaning not commonly told) story of the Civil War years in the United States. Superb acting! Don't miss it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My grandchildren like this so much I have to limit their time with it. I don't want them to do this and nothing else.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best thing i've watched all year! Definitely a must see! I can't wait for season 4! It can't come soon enough!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down! One of my favorite reads ever.  A real twist in the story which I really love.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|awesome!!!!!<br />book by who wrote this book anyway i mean really poop dog so this review was very pretty short
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I didn't like the lifeproof case at all it's not lifeproof the charger doesn't fit once the case is one and water stil gets in the case and the plastic is very floppy
B008CIUS72|1.0|Will not install; does not work. 14 More words required. 14 More words required. 14 More words required. 14 More words required.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a fun family movie.  Kept the parents and the teens watching entertained.  Nice to see homage paid to the older video games.
B00499NHLC|4.0|I like the way the characters fit into curent time and fell the authors did a great job of selecting the actors in the episodes.  If you like Sherlock Holmes give this a try.  As with all new things, be open minded to the change in time.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This is a very enjoyable, simple and visually appealing game for all ages.  Scales nicely on phone all the way to 10&#34; tablet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is THE BEST and easy read of God's word!  I have  read through the Bible 6 times in the last 25 years, and this version arrives on my phone and Ipad with a daily reminder and is just THE BEST!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|it<br /> was all wonderful and beautiful has it could be  actor should of got more RECOMMENDTION AT THE REWARD SHOW YOU NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM....THE YOUNG MAN WAS BELIVEABLE.
B008ASGP3U|4.0|The story is suspenseful and very well-told.  It was my initial encounter with Ian Rankin and was enough for me to look for more.
1582701709|1.0|It's a con. The same as religion. There's no truth whatsoever in any of it. Use the pages for toilet paper. Always remember that the only people Self-Help books help - are its authors<br />Joshea Hosea author of [[ASIN:B00BCS4JCO I Taught God to Gamble]]
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|I loved lots of this movie--after all it has both Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman in it, so how could it go wrong? And yet, it does. It seemed as though Phoenix had an intense relationship with his character, but one which fueled him to spectacular overacting instead of making it easier for us to have a good relationship with his character.
0062238868|5.0|sounds weird but I got my husband this book for valentines after seeing the tragedy of his death in Texas truly a loss to our country I wanted my military loving husband to read about him....
B003EV6DBW|5.0|Vincent and the Doctor. Truly the best episode of the season (possibly more seasons) and I love the first episode, Eleventh hour as well. It's a great new introduction to the world and characters.
B007MUQGKO|5.0|B&W Frankie Stein, I got this for my daughter, but her BFF's mom had already got it for her...grrr. SO, I gave it to her BFF (who didn't have this particular one ). She loved it, like all the MH Dolls. Someone was happy, so I was happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I personally love this app. It never gets old and whenever i get bored i just get on my kindle and play this game. Great app.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|and I couldn't put it down! It involves themes of trust, deception, perception, motive, the power of fear and how politics and power can go oh, so wrong - what we usually think of as \\"adult themes,\\" but concepts that should be a part of the becoming-an-adult process. It will be great to discuss the book with him and see how much he got out of it beyond the well-crafted adventure story.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars only because it takes an awful lot for me to give a book 5 stars - it would have to be Cutting for Stone by Abraham Verghese or Last Night at Twisted River by John Irving. But it was close!
B00AQ08W22|4.0|This film surprised me, in that I liked it so much.  Certainly well enough to buy it and see it some more.  It was just the same, only different from the original.  And they included nods to the original which pleased me very well.  A good evening's entertainment, especially if you throw in some popcorn.  With butter.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I am a great fan of Andre Bocelli and this latest CD is one of the reasons why.  The songs are all done so beautifully and I have watched the Public Television showing where he performed all the music on this CD.  In my opinion he is truly one of the handful of artists, worldwide, who stand out from all the rest.
B0012CCNUU|4.0|This collection is a mix of some really brilliant songs, together with some ho-hum tracks. My wife had the Wilbury's first album on CD and I really liked it, but the songs that were added from the second album to make this collection don't stand up as well.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|All I can say about my dvd purchase of Downton Abbey, Season one and two is wow! I loved them, they were exactly as depicted and the only problem is that I watched them much too fast and had to order Season three as soon as  I finished the first two. The interplay between the servants and the Crawley family is eye opening, especially for the watcher unfamiliar with the edwardian era. It is a time gone by that none of us here in the States have memory of. Stilted manners, with the behind the scenes subterfuge shines a beacon on what may have been the glaring hypocrisies of the landed gentry of that time. I loved the language, actors, drama and costumes enormously and am only sad that I will now have to wait for Season four to be broadcast. I am sure I will be pre-ordering!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I used to have a pet horse ,but he died.:(<br />When ever I play this game it gives me joy in my heart.
B00009TB5G|5.0|All I can say is, if you loved the original release of Lord of the Rings, you'll really love the extended version.  There!  I said it, and I'm glad.
B000001F9N|5.0|it takes me back to my youth.  god bless you in heaven Donna.  she is the queen that opened the path to so many.  she brought sexy into music and it has never stopped since
0307719774|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product. It’s well worth the money. I got both myself and my boyfriend one in 2012 for his birthday, and already it’s so interesting going back and reading my previous answers! 5/5 stars, definitely recommended for those who enjoy learning about how they used to be! :D
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I ordered Season one and two of Downton Abbey and loved them. In fact, I watched them much too fast and was really sad when I had finished! So I had to order Season three since I was literally hooked on the series. I have already watched all of Season three and can't believe that I have to wait for a new season four to continue to catch up with the Crawleys and their servants! The story line is compelling, the actors terrific, and I love the fashions that the ladies wear, and was interested in watching the fashions change from 1912 into the 1920's. I will definitely purchase the next season and now I will have to look around for another set of dvd's set in victorian or edwardian times to keep myself occupied in the evening.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Santa with naughty and nice tattoos, and Yeti as his helpers? The Easter Bunny with a boomerang and Australian accent? This movie has so many great characters I don't know who I like better. I do know that I thoroughly enjoyed it! It put a new twist on some old favorites. Family Favorite!!
B00B1CGD5M|4.0|I saw this album after another purchase I had made so I instantly swooped up a copy being a long time soilwork fan. I was also pleasantly surprised when it came with not just 1 but 2 CDs for about 10$ .. Between these CDs there are some very good songs but I noticed their style had changed a bit but I guess that's natural I guess.. If your a huge soilwork fan like myself or just looking for something new check this album(s) out .
B0055PGUYU|5.0|My son recommended this book.  I have reached a place in my life where I have no choice but to make changes.  I never realized how much of what I do is just habit.  I am making habit changes by getting rid of or adapting those I have now.  I read the entire book on my Kindle Fire in less than two days including all the acknowledgements at the end.  I have since recommended the book to several friends also needing to make lifestyle changes. Other books I have read about minimizing and making changes did not inspire me to get rid of not only habits but junk in my mind, my life, and my storage unit!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Whole series was well written.  Third book itself was very harsh and not such the \\"happy ending\\" one sees many times with novels.  Not so much a young adult series/book like I first believed it would be
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm glad I chose to read the trilogy. It was a great book and an  easy read. It was a page turner and I missed quite a fee sleepless nights.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game so much because all the dragons and the fun it is at the race track and trying to breed the dragons it is just like Tony monsters but it easier than tiny monsters I am so happy it is free. How I started to play this game is because I saw my dad play this game so I tried it and I loved have fun playing.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This might be the only easel style case currently available for the HD 8.9.  Very nice quality and works perfectly landscape or portrait.  Nice!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book while not appropriate for children .. is  Very well written . It pulls you into the store that you can't bare to put  it down. Wonderful read makes me want to see the movie  to see how they compare
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I think this game is super fun and I can't seem to stay away from it! I got it yesterday morning and I am already halfway through the first part and enjoy it a lot. I would recommend this game to all!!!!!
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Bad quality of disc picture  very blurry I plan on returning this item.  This sucks I was really looking forward to this set
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Best Television out there. Gives theatrical films a run for the money. Blu-ray picture and sound are top-notch.  If you have a home theater tis collection is a must-have.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Hey this game is great for blowing things up and killing bad guys and time all at the same time.  Only problem is controlls freeze every so often and there are things going on that make no sense.  But for the most part a really fun game just stay patient and don't break your pad and you will be fine.
B001AW156U|2.0|Only 1 pair fit right on my ps3 controllers. The other 2 sets didn't grip on at all. Kind of waste of not a lot of money
B009POHHR6|5.0|Great take on Superman and Luthor. Well done. Could not put it down until I read the whole story. I will definitely be reading it again and again.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Great story, another awesome book by Danielle.  Nothing but the best from her as she is the best.  I have every book, from the very first book to the last book (even pre-ordered the next one coming out in July) and I won't even let people borrow them as I'm afraid I won't get it back or get in back in &#34;like new&#34; condition.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|I did enjoy the book. It was typical Nicholas Sparks fare and did not really disappoint. I did not anticipate the paranormal bit at the end..it was a nice twist.
B00999DFP0|5.0|If you like The Big Bang Theory, then this is the only way to go. Great price and great service!
B008L40Q7E|4.0|`YOU&# x2019;<br />Fleming, Ian (2012-10-16). Dr. No (James Bond) (p. 236). AmazonEncore. Kindle Edition. What does this mean? Is it a typo error? I found this set of letters in a lot of pages in the book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this story in the beginning but just a short time into this, I couldn't stop reading. Harry Bosch  always captures us!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Too many people use Facebook to complain about their relationships, family, friends, etc.  What happen to &#34;having fun&#34;  Now all it is is a drama board.  People need to start having fun again, meet new people and people they haven't seen is a very long time, and just enjoy it.  Stop the bitchen and complaining.  Facebook also should block most of the swear words as they haven't gotten out of control.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I bought this book and had it downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  I was amazed at the blink of an eye, how quickly I received this book.  Great book, full of suspense, a real page turner.  Keep writing Dan Brown and  I will keep buying!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The game is really addictive,but I had to reinstall because of an error. I serendipitously discovered that doing so is beneficial. Nets you lots of lives,and a free refill which makes up for lives not refilling as they should. No FB sync issues on my end either.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well written gooey drama on the inside - crunchy chocolatey zombies on the outside - I'm completely hooked.  PLEASE don't stop making new seasons/episodes - I'd have no reason to live, or at least no reason to watch TV anymore.<br /><br />PS - I want to be on the show, even if I get eaten by zombies!!!
B000QUCNXG|5.0|Loved the format of a one-sided conversation, I was surprised by how well it moved. An eye-opening view of how Americans are viewed. Leaves you wondering.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Great grand very happy to get this Ingot him one for Christmas and he wanted more sets to build more .
B002YDMWK2|5.0|I love books where I can gain knowledge from reading and this book was no exception.  Loved it!  I ordered this book and received it pretty fast and it was in excellent condition and inexpensive.  Great book, Great price, Great condition for a used book!
B0087EACJK|5.0|Continuity is, in a word, amazing. The puzzles are constantly changing, and trying to beat your fastest time is a blast. I recommend this to everyone.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of my all time favorites. Watching it on Amazon makes it that much more enjoyable; no commercials!
1603580557|3.0|In general, I would say \\"I liked this book.\\"<br /><br />I would also say that there were two things that really bugged me.<br /><br />The first is related to value judgments.  Readers will have strong feelings regarding most of the systems Meadows discusses.  These are systems such as economic growth, oil extraction, school performance, illicit drug consumption, or environmental preservation.  Meadows never really takes the step of staking out a position as an advocate, but it's also clear she's not neutral on the issues, which creates an awkward tension.  For example, Meadows remarks that \\"[o]ne of the most heartbreaking\\" systems behaviors is encroachment on the habitat of endangered species.  Well, she may feel that way, but the feeling is subjective and irrelevant to the point she's trying to make about systems behavior.  For the reader as well as for Meadows, the goal of this primer -- as a primer -- is simply to get a handle on systems analysis in some basic, abstract ways.  Using rhetoric like this might sense as a way to engage readers since we probably have strong feelings on the issue, but it can also be distracting from said goal.<br /><br />As an alternative, Meadows could have stuck with value-neutral systems to illustrate the same dynamics.  Indeed, her very first example is such a system: a thermostat.  I suppose I would have preferred more examples like this throughout the discussion.  It turns out they are not hard to find in everyday life.  A flushing toilet, for example, functions with a runaway feedback loop constrained by a stabilizing feedback loop.<br /><br />The second thing is that the book is just a little too... soft.  The author seems to think her concepts are harder to absorb than they really are, routinely following up a mere two-page passage with a half-page summary of that passage.  And she is frequently imprecise in her writing, such that you are not invited to think critically about what she says because it becomes your job to give it firm logical sense in the first place.  ...Which is to say, Meadows writes as a guru, with the expectation that readers want to mentally mimic her wisdom, not examine it critically.  For example, Meadows says that \\"[o]ne of the worst ideas humanity ever had was the interest rate\\" because interest provides \\"a rational, quantitative excuse for ignoring the long term.\\"  Well, that's quite a claim, when you consider that interest yields long-term payoff to someone who abstains from immediate consumption.<br /><br />To be fair, the question of exactly how approachable and rigorous an introduction to a subject should be has no objective answer.  The problem is that after reading this primer I don't feel very primed.  The book is clearly written to get laypeople to have a few tools of systems thinking they can carry with them throughout their day-to-day, not to provide a gateway for laypeople into further depths of the systems discipline.  I say this, but fully acknowledge that either purpose is worth carrying out.  Prospective buyers should simply be aware of which purpose this book pursues.<br /><br />I dwell on these two things I didn't like mainly because the other reviews already cover what there is to like about this book.  On balance I too liked the book.  In spite of my own complaint that the book was too soft, I must say it was very eye-opening, and will lead to further readings on systems thinking.  And although I found them distracting, I thought the contentious issues Meadows uses to illustrate systems behavior were treated sensibly and without undue ideological rhetoric.t firm logical sense in the first place.  ...Which is to say, Meadows writes as a guru, with the expectation that readers want to mentally mimic her wisdom, not examine it critically.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This glass cutter works well.  I wish is was a little heavier and that the adjustment screws were better bit overall it does a good job.
B005I64U34|5.0|I got the movie quick and in good shape it's a good movie and I would tell others to buy it
B009RI4FRU|5.0|If you enjoy SMART comedy's and eschew slapstick and avoid Sandler/Carrey this movie is for you.  It's not only funny, it's charming, and heart warming in the most twisted of ways.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Seductively annoying. Plays well on Kindle fire HD as I use to play it on iPod touch but this is better space wise
B0035LJY6C|5.0|Love it...it's funny it's a great family movie for me and my kids never gets old<br />I hope every one enjoys it as much as we did a must see and a must have
B005MLOOJA|5.0|imaginative and compelling characterization.  Alicia and Kalinda alone could carry the show but the entire cast is top flight.<br />I highly recommend it.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Carlos and Eric really rip it up on this CD.  Totally &#34;KICK BUTT&#34; if I do say so myself.  Very pleased with this purchase and I will be making more.  Good job Amazon!
0374214913|4.0|Ending was a bit of a let-down, characters seemed a little hollow, but plot was good, story moved along well and references to modern technology keep my attention. Would recommend!
B0063GORYU|5.0|so far this game is fun and on going great time blowers.  great for waiting for appointments or transport. or. just to blow.
B003B17YZE|5.0|While he was alive, Electric Ladyland was his greatest achievement.<br />It's hard to believe he released (4) LP's while alive & (12) CD's since his death.<br />Where are they all coming from?<br /><br />Any Jimi Hendrix Collection should have &#34;Ladyland&#34; in it & the Video is a nice touch.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Having seen the stage production and knowing the music backwards and forwards, I was a bit anxious about how this would be done.  It exceeded all my expectations!  This is a &#34;must see&#34; movie!
B0000067L2|5.0|Some would call this an &#34;Oldies&#34; recording.  Maybe it is BUT STILL VERY HOT!  Brings back great memories of a somewhat more happy time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I always misplace the hand calculator that I have had for years.  I always find myself saying, &#34;but I had it right here!&#34;.  This app fixed that issue.  It works great and I don't have to worry about losing it because my Kindle Fire HD is like another appendage (according to my husband).
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved this series all the way through...until the ending of Requim. Where was the ending? Lauren Oliver left so many unanswered questions and nothing was made clear. It seems like this will not be the last book...but if it is this is one reader who will be even angrier.
B004US4K2C|5.0|This was a great product and better then other launchers. it fixs well with the other GO products.including the Go txt/sms app.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|This version is pretty much the same as the free version, but this one has sound and it works great on with my foscam on kindle fire. I use it as a baby monitor and can't even think of ways to make it better.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I really appreciate her voice in a sea of authors who believe women are &#34;blend ins.&#34; Thank you Sheryl Sandberg for challenging the status quo, even if it doesn't appease all parties.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so fun to play when you're bored! I'm glad that I can actually play it on my droid with the amazon app store!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was slow to start but it did pick up and then I couldn't put it down!  Hang in there through the beginning.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Fits my Kindle fire like a glove, love the plastic clips, the do not obstruct the screen. worth the extra few $
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Can't stop listening to both of her albums. Album is great to listen straight through. I recommend this to any music lovers.
B008Y7G6UO|4.0|I'm a fan of John Carpenter (producer), The Dude (if you don't know who that is, check out &#34;The Big Lebowski&#34;) and Karen Allen (Animal House) so of course I had to see this movie again.  John Carpenter (&#34;Halloween&#34;) did a movie called &#34;Dark Star&#34; while he was still in college that still has a cult following.  &#34;Starman&#34; is more a product of the American culture of its time, but the question it asks (&#34;what would happen if some alien culture were to capture Voyager and take us up on our invitation to visit?&#34;) and the answer this movie provides is intriguing - and far more believable that what we see today on such programs as H2's &#34;Ancient Aliens.&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Been playing for a couple of months now and love My Horse.  Would like to see some more variation in the activities and competitions maybe a few more horse<br />breeds to choose from.  But either way it is still fun to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I don't get PBS on my TV ... so the DVD's were my first experience with Downton Abbey ... and I loved it!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Paul McCartney rocks out! This was suggested by a friend and I loved every minute of it. Dave Grohl is a genius.
B008YUNDJS|5.0|This is a classic book on the subject of negotiation. The principles outlined are easy to remember, easy to apply and very effective, as my short experience with them so far has proved.<br />I'd say it is one of the most influential books I've ever read.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|love the author of the book, have all the books and now all the movies, its a tear jerker, Miley  pretty good in this movie
B00005JKNF|5.0|This has been my favorite for a long time. I love the interplay between the staff and the upstairs people. You will too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game because there is lots to do, you can buy different people and you buy things with the money you collect I the game. You also have missions which I like be use you try and complete them. You can also skip missions,by buying them in the shop which is good be use if you have a mission and you have to have face book for it and you are not aloud to go on face book you can skip it.over all it is a great game, and you should try it.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is one of the most inspiring, saddest books I've ever read in my life!!! It is filled with so much emotion its insane!! You can really feel all the emotions running through the character it makes your heart break, your head spin and its just an absolutely terrific book with a great message: STOP BULLYING!<br />I am a total believer in stopping bullying and I recommend this book to everyone I think everyone needs to read a book like this it really opens up your mind and makes you realize some important things about life. PLEASE read this book! its absolutely amazing! I know I keep repeating that but its true.<br />One of the most amazing books I've ever read.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|I loved the movie & was impressed with Rodriguez as human being, but music was so -so, IMHO. Booklet was very good... or was that the other Rodriguez CD?
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is such a feel good movie and, of course, all the players are well drawn and the actors excellent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer it is my favorite game ever.... MY<br /> Child loves this game plus she loves the way it changes.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|lovelovelovelove L.O.V.E. An amazing book and an excellent series!!!! this is the first book in the Kane Chronicles series. Its thrilling and a book I just couldn't put down, especially being a fan of ancient mythology. I recommend this book!
B00BI745AA|1.0|It was supposed to be a fantastic opera, with great voices and booming, solid orchestral sounds to the great music.  Instead it was &#34;talk-sing&#34; dialogue with actors instead of vocalists.  The entire meaning and depth of emotion was totally non-existent in this new version.  If the Director wanted drama, he could have saved a ton of money by not paying for all the music royalties.<br /><br />Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe this disastrous failed attempt to put this story on the screen.  What a joke!
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Some previous reviewers have said about all you need to know about this collection. I will just say this is some of the most seminal music of its time. Ferry, Eno, MacKay, Manzanera, Thompson, Hobson et al were ahead of their time artists with a vision of the future. The sound for me is fantastic. Enjoy, my friends, enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think that this app is a neat one, sort of like temple run, but not very remotely. Its fun, and i like how it changes around from country to country. I just purchased this app a few days ago, when my little cousin recommended it to me. I personally like this app.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has done it again: writing another superbly awesome amazing series!!! Although I will admit its not as good as Percy Jackson its still a great book that I had trouble putting down. I recommend this book and the rest of the series: the first book: the lost hero and the second book : the son of neptune. Read those before this one because this is the third book in the series. I can't wait for the fourth to come out!!!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love it, but it wont let me update to the Sydney one :(<br />I wanna get the surfer girl...
B00BHMETKC|3.0|There is definitely a sense of urgency and suspense in this film, but the compression makes it a bit thin in how the embassy staff could learn enough about playing a part to pass as a film crew. Ben Affleck's character never gets ruffled, which is essential, but I'm not sure how much of this was creating a role versus Affleck's own personality/affect. A good movie, worth the telling of the story (despite liberties with the facts), but not a great one

B0053TMP24|5.0|Not as good as the perch jackson books but a close second! I love this series anyways though because there just such good books. Read the first book in the series (The Lost Hero) before this one or you'll be totally lost. THis is an awesome book that I recommend!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|I've been a fan of Soilwork for quite a while, but even then, I was concerned about the quality of a double album. That concern was completely blown away once this arrived though. Soilwork have delivered arguably their best, most diverse album yet from front to back. Both discs are solid on their own, and as a whole, they are truly phenomenal and make for a wonderful, cohesive whole. I strongly recommend this album for any fan of metal, particularly those fond of melodic death metal that isn't afraid to experiment with their style.
B0064QNS62|3.0|Though I never played Mario, I have enjoyed various platform games in the 90s, so I was excited to see an old favorite genre offered for free. Marv the Miner 2 is a cute and challenging game. Even though it starts out easy, the degree of difficulty increases rapidly and I would consider it rather high for an average player.<br /><br />Currently being stuck on level 13, I have found two situations that are quite tricky: One is to position Marv just right for a long jump, especially when an enemy is after him. The other is a sideways jump onto a ladder. He has to move up or down immediately or he'll fall off and die.<br /><br />When starting the game, either after quitting or after Marv has lost all his lives, the game defaults to show the first twelve levels. If you're on level 13 for example, you will need to scroll to the screen with levels 13-24. Just a minor, unnecessary annoyance.<br /><br />If you like platformers, you may want to give this game a try.<br /><br />UPDATE: Maybe there's a trick to get Marv positioned just right for the long jump on level 13 - for me it's hit or miss, mostly miss. Not even once have I been able to get him onto the ladder after jumping off the spring. Enough is enough. I have now deleted this game. This also prompted me to reduce my rating from 4 stars to 3.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Sandra Bullock has been in some very good movies, but this is not one.  It was very predictable but entertaining.as well.  I would not watch a second time.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Three words: love, love, and love! this book is great! not as good as percy jackson and the olympians (this series is like a continuation of it) but its still great! I recommend this book!
0316228532|4.0|I came away impressed by JK Rowling's adult book overall. I think she had strong points and the book kept me engrossed.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|The movie is great, but the 3D will not work.  I have other 3D movies that work fine and I know the region is not the issue, the movie just will not go.  Be careful if you are wanting the 3D version of this movie.
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|Its almost like a blast from the past, Its not only highly futuristic its also old school. Kixkin it old skoo just how I  prefer
B00992CF6W|1.0|Downloaded and installed in tablet and it Nvr came up on home screen! I bought it for my 5yr old how spent his toothfairy $ on this and he can't even play it!!
B0007Y08IS|2.0|It was recommended by a friend it was funny but not as funny as i hoped it would, using puppets was Funny on its own but other parts i was ready to turn it off,.o think ill just stick to real human moviethink
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooo much fun!! It is very addictive to play an  I like it more than Temple Run. The only thing that annoys me is all the ads! I go to the home menu and all these ads about other amazon games pop up. It is very annoying and I can't turn them off. But, this doesn't affect the gameplay so it fine. I have this game for kindle fire HD and it's better than iPhone. Best of all this game is FREEEEEEE!!!! Get it now!!!!<br />;)
B00A4OALL0|2.0|Once upon a time there was a concept of 'Selling Out'. What it meant way back when was denying your roots, sacrificing your artistic integrity and presenting a product aimed for big sales, well below your potential. In the jazz world of the 1960's, plenty of artists chased the easy buck, notably Miles, Wes Montgomery, Cannonball Adderley, and the rest of Miles' crew, including Wayne Shorter. Play less, make more, was the motto of the day.<br /><br />Cripes, few people have more admiration for Wayne's early career as the 'middleweight champion of the tenor sax'. God, he was brilliant in those days, playing forceful, virile tenor and he could compose with the best. But it seems that the influence of Miles, who had nothing but disdain for his audience, and the lure of a buck, put Wayne down another, easier path in the late '60's.<br /><br />Listening to this pastiche, with Wayne filling in 'color' on his weak-toned soprano (sure, he's 80, and more power to him, but he's been milking this wimpy schtick for empty decades)is painful. Let's learn to appreciate an artist when he is actually producing art and not venerate a long time sell-out for churning out yet more 'Money in the Pocket' (title of one of Cannonball's early pop albums and the title tune.)
B003O86FMW|5.0|G this is a very good book and can't wait for the next one to come to the kindle thanks

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun from the beginning it has been a great game very addicting and challenging to master, I would suggest this game to all of my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter really enjoys playing this game. It was suggested to her by a friend. I have not played it yet but my husband and son also like this game.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Love it Grt movie if u like Holmes mysteries and I truly enjoyed it and recommend it. Get it and u will love it
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really wanted to watch this show during its regular season, but it ran during the time of another favorite show.  I am very happy to be able to watch this show with my Amazon Prime account.  It's as great as I thought it would be.  I enjoy all of the major characters and the plotlines really  intrigue me, as I am a scientist as well.  The paranormal aspect just pushes the imagination!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Got it for Tracks 4 and 7. But track 11 just blows me away. I LOVE IT!  Very glad I got this album. Yay!
0143106651|5.0|This was one of my two favorite books as a child, and I recently purchased it for my niece as a Christmas gift, and read it aloud with her over the holidays. The story is timeless, having lost none of it's relevance in the intervening years as it addresses love, loss, peer pressure, social change, and the difficulty (and reward) of finding one's internal moral compass.
B008602KQI|2.0|Enjoy it but not what I expected although u got to watch it several times to get in to it but its a Grt movie don't regret the purchase but enjoy it
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I love Coldplay and this song is just another great hit. It has a wonderful beat to it that is good to listen to on the way to work. Really starts the day off right.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Old world meets new world tactics.  Just a fun adventure.  Well written, I had no trouble visualizing the bookstore. I loved the ending.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|Nothing too fancy about this box set but it is a great way to listen to 10 Joni Mitchell albums for relatively low price. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|this is an amazing album.  i first bought it for myself and have ordered it again several times to give as a gift.
B000U0O9FM|3.0|When I began reading this book I couldn't understand how it became popular fiction. However, I persevered. As I progressed through the story I felt like the author was growing, learning and finding his voice. The progression of the story mimics the progression of the author. It gives hope to new writers and with this quick learning (in the writers time frame) it did encourage me to want to read one of Chuck's later novels. If you can past the first few chapters you are in for a treat. But as a reader you will have to pull the story together on your own.
B009S33I68|5.0|General Moore has done a fantastic job of recounting the Ia Drang campaign of the Vietnam War, This book should be read by all prospective military leaders, especially the young lieutenants. [Then] Colonel Moore showed the characteristic of good officers of soldiers in a real, telling way at a time of deep stress and unimaginable hardship. His understanding of what it takes to lead troops, keep morale up, and to care for those under his responsibility was outstanding. The portrayal of the brave men of the 1st Calvary Division should be inspiring to all that follow and who love this country.<br /><br />From the start you know that this is not some book glorifying war, sprouting a particular political viewpoint on the war in Vietnam nor apologizing for it. General Moore just told the situation as it was. Blood, gore, heroics and stupidity from all levels of the force. From Brigade Commanders to squad leaders to the ordinary rifleman. The different way people react to stress and the unimaginable things they can do was well told and truly inspirational.<br /><br />Thank you Sir for your excellant book.
1400069807|2.0|I would be a lot more impressed with this book if it weren't for the fact that David Kessler wrote basically the same book three years earlier.  It's called \\"The End of Overeating\\" and is extensively researched and reported.  I highly recommend it - Kessler's book, that is.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gave a great perspective of the situation in the Middle East.  It was quite interesting to learn about the enemy and who we were fighting and &#34;why&#34;.  I also was intrigued with how things were between Chris and his family at home in America.<br />Chris was an especially interesting guy.  I enjoyed hearing about the chain of events that ultimately led him to becoming a SEAL sniper over in the Middle East.  He possessed some rare qualities and was one of the more mentally tough individuals I've ever read about.  You won't be able to put this book down.  He takes you through everything from childhood, high school, BUDS, the comical razing within the SEAL team, his numerous bar fights and &#34;fire&#34; fights (let me tell you... this guy was designed to fight) and through the tears he shed over lost comrades in the war.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great little take care of the horse scenario. Entertaining and safe for kids. I recommend for all little horse loving girls. Rachel
B00BP4VPUE|5.0|My boyfriend and I are addicted to this series. Every character was well thought out and I enjoy all the characters. I don't find a dull momment in this show! I really don't understand what is with the negative reviews! I love Kevin Bacon and even though he was my main interest in watching this show, the other characters all add something special  to the mix. This and The Client List are my two favorite shows to watch instantly on Amazon. However The Following is on the top of my list.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was traveling the night The Walking Dead season finale aired and I was seriously bummed about that. Thankfully, Amazon has all of the third season episodes available for purchase so I bought &#34;Welcome to the Tombs&#34; as soon as I returned home.<br /><br />All I will say is I love this show and am looking forward to the start of Season Four in October. I refuse to spoil the fun of watching the finale so go on and buy it! You won't be dissapointed!
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun game that my three year old grandson taught me.  Unfortunately, he's much better at it than his grandma!
B009S33I68|5.0|After having been Infantry , hearing of Hal Moore , and seeing Mel Gibson's film years ago , I THOUGHT this would be a &#34;Nice&#34; , easy read .. I was VERY Suprised to find out how wrong I could be .. His account was Gripping from the start , and what was (Necessarily) left out of the Film was there in all of it's Horrible , Stark , shocking &#34;Glory&#34; .. The Film should have been a 2-Parter at Least to even Attempt to convey this story .. This Book was Beautifully , lovingly , Honorably and Respectfully written by a Leader of Men .. and I wish I would have read it Years ago ..
B002RI8ZPK|5.0|ah no one can touch raymond chandler. crisp prose,under stated cast,no hurry but the end leaves you thinking what is wrong with todays authors.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Some of the shots and images from &#34;Life&#34; are downright amazing.  The &#34;All Regions&#34; David Attenborough version works perfectly fine on my USA sony blu-ray player.  I know some other users mentioned problems there. I haven't seen the Oprah version, so I can't compare the two, but I think David Attenborough's narrations are as great as always and I'm happy I was able to find a great deal on the Blu-Ray version!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I'm a history buff so I enjoyed this movie and wish they would make more like it.  I didn't check the<br />facts but it seem to go along with most known facts
1439192812|5.0|I needed this when I was a child and was confused about what adults told me and forced me to believe.  It needs to be available to every child!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love a good mystery filled with surprising turn events.  The characters are so good I find myself really disliking the person portrayed in some cases.  Whenever the occasion arises I go on about the show to whomever will listen (something I didn't think I would ever do).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very well written.  It was an eye opener to me about the whole plot.  It intrigued me to the point where I didn't want to put the book down.  Great book, love the story.
B0064QNS62|4.0|downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br />this is a cute game - reminds me of Mario except way easier.... I did not find the controls to be too horrible - if takes some getting used to which jump button works best - I found my self over or under shooting where I wanted to go but they did get easier as I got to know how they were going to react - I played through 8 levels before leaving this and so far I have it easy to play - I assume it will get harder - right now it is very non stressfull! I would like it if the gems had a point and if the levels were to get longer it would make a reset to the beginning of level stink (I died once jumping off a platform - I was curious to see how high was too high) overall not a bad game... not bad to pick up as faotd - I don't think I would have been happy paying for it.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I'm a fan of the book, and of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, it doesn't let down.  It has been a while since I read the book, so I can't say how accurate everything is, but it is a movie that sweeps you up in its adventure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! 3rd and definitely not the last time I'll be reading this. I highly recommend this entire series.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I decided to read (or try) to read this trilogy because of its popularity. However, I couldn't get past a few pages in the second book. I don't know where to begin when describing all that I feel is wrong or horrible about this trilogy. 1. It insulted my intelligence. 2. The writing was sophomoric 3. The character development was pathetic: unrealistic and contradictory. 4. The story line is hideously boring. 5. The stereotyping of men and women portrayed by the controlling, cold man and the weak, but infatuated virgin makes me weep for humankind. Have we really progressed so little in the past 100 years? The BDSM content and excruciatingly overdone sex scenarios are the only things that I can imagine made these books sell so well. Curious teenage girls, perhaps? I just don't get it.  Is this the Jerry Springer and reality TV trend crossing over into literature by the way of Fan Fiction? I wish I was warned before reading. I was looking for something lightweight for a beach read. I feel like my brain was submerged in a lukewarm bowl or instant oatmeal spiked with cheap cayenne pepper to mask the fact that it was, indeed, boring.  I will never get those few hours of my life back. So many great books to read, so little time...and I succumbed to the hype.  I hope the author is enjoying all the money she made from this. That's about the only thing I can somewhat respect.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very cute, fun movie. A lot of family-oriented movies these days can't stand up to &#34;classic&#34; stories to me, but this one does it. It's fun and kid friendly without being ridiculous to adults.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Nonstop action and bad guy super cool. Best bond film so far with Daniel Craig. Sad that M had to die.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it kept me reading until the end. Nothing like it out. Good plot good story line. The suspense just kept coming.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my horse is a fun game.  you feed, care for, treat, train, &amp; compete with your horse.  addictive game!!<br />you can also visit other stables.
B009AMANH4|5.0|in the world today there are so many &#34;wasted opportunities&#34; for good films, but this is not one of them -- Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field are amazing and our family loved watching it. I seldom buy videos, but I couldn't resist on this one.
B0030B624E|5.0|Here is an example of a comedy/ horror(??) movie that, although is not believable, was not stupid.  I was thoroughly entertained the whole movie.
0744014549|5.0|High quality book with great narrative from the head artist. I only wish it had more on characters and props and less on environments.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked this book a lot even though I don't read these types of murder mystery type books anymore. It was not gruesome. Both main characters were very interesting people. I loved how it was written especially how it starts. There are some good surprises in there.
B00577WFZE|5.0|Outstanding!!! When he is in front of a crowd he comes alive. His live albums are light years ahead of his studio albums. He really got his MOJO working on this one.
0307716546|2.0|I didn't finish the book. I dislike the way it is written; dead characters talking to each other while they watch themselves and others.<br /><br />Judi Seidel
B00000DOZB|4.0|Almost as ethereal & lofty as Tales From Topographic Oceans, if you can imagine that.  First Wakeman-less Yes album having been replaced by Patrick Moraz who does an outstanding job especially on Soon & Sound Chaser.  The absorbing Gates of Delirium draws you into an amplitude of sound.  The 1974 vinyl sounded great for the time but I think this remaster has actually improved the overall sound quality.  This changing-of-the-guard album is a must for any Yes collection.
033046406X|4.0|This was a really good book. He always has a strong story line and all kinds of twists and turns that keep you turning the page. His very best, in my opinion, was Kane and Abel. I'd give this one a thumbs up too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story had me from e moment I opened it.  It was definitely an emotional read.  The author really made me feel for the characters.
B008220DGE|1.0|What a pretentious, self-indulgent, undisciplined, mess. A waste of talent for all involved. Amy Adams should have known better, and Seymour Hoffman seems attracted to bombs like this one.<br /><br />A real load of crap.<br /><br />Judi Seidel
B0013ND30M|5.0|Awesome Price and of course awesome movie all daughters want Disney no matter what age ....There a keep sake for generations ;)
B007712XAU|5.0|My husband & I began watching Downton Abbey in the 3rd season and felt a little lost! I finally broke down and bought this set and now we understand and love this series. I do not know what all the discussion was in past reviews, but this set had the season 2 Christmas special. We thoroughly enjoyed getting caught up and we can not wait for Season 4!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|From the moment I began to read Slammed, I was hooked!  I really enjoyed reading this book and the characters.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel gave it his all and it shows. Very adroit direction and acting. Loved it. The ending was poignant and just.<br /><br />Judi Seidel
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I love this series and wish it had gone on and on for a long long time!!  wish I owned it
B008XBHIEY|5.0|I finally decided my 14 and 12 year old boys were at the right age to view this, although I half expected them to scoff at the special effects. No way- after all these years this movie holds up in every aspect.  In fact, both my kids mentioned that it seemed more realistic without all of the obvious computer generated graphics they are used to seeing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever !!!!<br />For the haters out there they don't know what they are missing ! I wish they would update it more often though!!
1451624468|5.0|I would recommend this book to any rational thinking person.  It makes sense, is clear and you don't need a degree in math to understand it.  It provides a glimpse of how we came to be (as in our universe).
B005H9B44A|1.0|Insipid and predictable, even by the standards of a comic book makeover. The \\"acting\\" is wooden. Loki is the only character who appears to have a pulse, sometimes. The special effects are uninspired. The government villains are laughable, and not in a funny way. This is a movie made for 15 year old boys. Run away!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have become a Susan Boyle fan and I believe this is my most  favorite album of the four I have.
B002Z58GQI|5.0|lost the cap though, but i use it mostly for house hold computer to computer to tv stuff so no problems
1455502758|5.0|The world lost a great author when Christopher Hitchens passed away.  This book is a great look into his mind.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game! It's just like life - it's fun, it's frustrating, and at times (when I get a perfect score) I feel as though I've accomplished something. And I just keep plugging along. Thanks to the makers of Quell Reflect.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is the most comfortable pair of headphones I have ever owned.  They are  the third pair I have purchased over the years and I sincerely hope they never go out of production.
B006QKJQ12|5.0|For everyone, if you liked the first kungfu panda, you'll love this one even more, with the hint of a third...
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel plays a great part in this movie, I thought there could of been more action in this movie but I did like it!
B00AHSLU2C|2.0|Fuzzy picture on all my resent movie purchases.not sure if I will stay with prime video,might go vudu buy Sony
B00013RC8O|5.0|I gave this as a requested Christmas gift and he was quite happy to receive it. I can't say, for myself, as I've never seen it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This show always holds my attention. Love the humor, intelligence, drama,and mystery ....it has it all. The characters have all developed individually, and as a team...can't wait for each new episode!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I really loved this movie, I am past 40 but do remember how I felt! This is great from beginning to end.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Great series just what I was looking for ,since I missed the first season . Cleared up some of the questions on what i had missed going forward  Very fast shipping. A+
B0018QPPXW|5.0|I remembered this one from years back and was not dissapointed. It is a delightful comedy. More like this would be welcome.
0061153923|5.0|I adore this book, especially as it is narrated by the master himself Neil Gaiman. The story is beautifully described and the story is so fantastic that will bring you to a world I want to be a part of.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie! From beginning to end it keeps you wanting more! A must see worth paying for!
B008HTQ28K|4.0|The only problem I have with the book once you start reading you cannot put it down. I normaly read at night when I go to bed but before I know it is 1 o'clock in the morning.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have definately become a Susan Boyle fan and this album certanly cements the feeling. It's a lovely collection of songs that I will enjoy over and over again.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|The movie was ordered as a digital download.  After ordered with &#34;one click&#34;, It would appear to start, then freeze.  Could not find a place on amazon to ask for a refund or to even report the problem.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I know there are a lot of Micheal Moore haters out there but I really like the guy's sense of dry humor and I LOVE this movie, I have shown it to my friends and I really think it's entertaining as well as gives a different view. There are not sick parts except in the beginning where a guy with no insurance cuts himself and stitches himself up at home.  After that part everything else is very mild, entertaining and enlightening.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hachi is such a heartwarming story of how loyal a dog can be. But he has stretched that loyalty beyond even when his owner has died already. He really missed him so much. I have seen this several time on tv but still I bought the CD for my own copy. It never fails to make me cry even if I have watched it over and over.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love the walking dead but it wasn't as suspenseful as seasons 1 & 2. Season 3 was very predictable.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is great for everyone in the family to watch! Lots of great story lines and personally I love women's business fashion in this! Must watch!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Fun and lighthearted. It really becomes addictive and you find yourself logging on morning and evening to check your new dragons etc
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever I build big hoses and sky scrapper. I can make survival houses and make a portal to the nether.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I thought it was a very good game, works good on tablet, but I think you'd beyour tablet, without a case for this game..It works in the tall form, not the wide form.... You can shake to get better score, don't let your case hold you back....<br />TAZ-MAN-TIM
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was a great episode of Downton Abbey, but this series is well done and delightful.  Every episode is captivating.
B003UD7JEE|3.0|Forget this series and check out \\"Continuum\\".<br /><br />Like most of these over-produced action television shows, \\"Nikita\\" is good viewing for 10-15 episodes before the boredom factor sets in and you struggle to focus long enough to watch another episode in its entirety.  The original female assassin concept was good enough to justify several versions and Maggie Q is the best of those who have played some version of this title character.<br /><br />Maggie's Nikita is an oddly interesting characterization, normally dimensionality is a good thing.  But here she is easy to take in one dimension and when she starts to show some vulnerability or complexity it just doesn't seem plausible.<br /><br />One thing I enjoy are the fantasy scenes with Alex (Lyndsy Fonseca) and her younger self (Eliana Jones). There is a physical resemblance but Jones is a talented actress while the struggling Fonseca is quite painful to watch.  Watching them together the surreal talent disparity makes you wonder if someday they will account for it by disclosing that Alex suffered brain damage at age 15.<br /><br />Overall, the sophistication level is extremely low, too low to work as an extended engagement.  Like most of these silly things each episode is another moronic \\"deus ex machina\\" ending just waiting to happen.  Apparently the writers and the target audience (at least the one their writing has built) are just not clever enough for a more sophisticated plot device.  Good grief, Edwin S. Porter made his \\"Life of an American Fireman\\" short in 1902 for the Edison Manufacturing Company. One of the earliest American narrative films, it depicts the rescue of a woman and child from a burning building, and does so with more suspense and a whole lot less narrative cheating than your standard \\"Nikita\\" episode.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|While each case holds my attention, it is the characters, their relationships and the excellent restraint in the writing that I can't get enough of.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoy seek & find games, this is..It's good but you have to keep going back & forth from room to room, using & finding different tools, giving up some tools for others, This is a very good game, just not the type I usually like..It is very well done for this type, some of you's I'm sure would really like it...<br />TAZ-MAN-TIM
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great and the world tour updates keep it fresh, my daughter 9 loves this game and plays it like mad
1594135851|5.0|I just finished this book and am now starting &#34;Mockingjay&#34;. I really enjoyed both the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; books that I have read so far. I have seen the first movie, and can't wait until this one comes out in November!! The only downside to this book, is at the begin Suzanne Collins &#34;explains&#34; some characters and events as if this is the first we are hearing of it. BUT, if you read the first book, all of this information is known so it seems a little repetitive. Other than that, it was great!
B008NMT684|5.0|This app is very good for teaching the different types of community vehicles. They are so proud when they have completed all the puzzles.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. The other two books were great, but this one really did it for me! Loved it! Who would have thought the &#34;storytelling&#34; would be this good?!? I
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|My two year old asks for &#34;car race&#34; every day. I don't mind this movie on repeat, Pixar always adds little bits of humor for us grown up kids.
0439023521|5.0|I recently read the book and LOVED it!! I had already seen the movie, so I was a little hesitant about reading the book, since normally the books are so much better than the movie. I enjoyed them both! I think Suzanne Collins did a great job writing the book, and the directors did a great job making the movie. I could see the actors as these &#34;characters&#34; and it made it come to life.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is a really good app for children who love vehicles. They get excited about each new one they can put together.
0307279189|4.0|I struggled through finishing this book because it is on my book club list and because my daughter-in-law is a runner. However, I learned a lot about the sport and have a much fuller appreciation of the kind of commitment required to participate in such an agonizing sport.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game I just wish it would give you more moves, but I play it almost every night Really fun. I highly recomend it......
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Easy to use. Can sync with other family members so we can keep up with each other. I would recommended it .
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie and was told that I have to read the book. I am very impressed with the book and you definitely get more details about the story. However, I am having terrible issues with the Kindle Edition (Note: I am using the Kindle App on my iPad). I bookmark the page I stopped on, then try to return to the book the next day. However, when I open the app it is always on the wrong page and I have to refresh it every time. Other than this annoying issue, I am really enjoying the book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm glad that this book was created to set the record straight. The author illustrated the final mission with great detail. I really enjoyed this read!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Two lost souls come together under circumstances that seem to fill a void. The relationship they build is a heart-wrenching, believable love story. One brings a good work ethic, sass, personality and a vulnerability about the world. The other brings experiences of the world and business. The two learn from each other and form a bond that one mistakes for a love so deep they will do anything and the other realizes the decision made before the relationship is still the one thing needed to do. I could not put it down, I was drawn to each character and the nuances of every relationship.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I find this relaxing after I turned off the sound & stupid timer.  It is pretty to look at too.
B009S33I68|4.0|This was a great book. True Story.  It held my interest. It brought back some memories that were good and not so good.  I can still hear the Whop - Whop of the Hueys in my mind.  I would recommend this to anyone that served there.  I am not living in the past but am truly thankful and proud that I served my country.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Very predictable and boring in parts though the singing is great. Could have been more exciting. A Glee movie with out the Glee!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I absolutely love this franchise. Fun and full of adventure. It is as good as and almost better than the first two!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Any movie with Tommy Lee Jones is bound to be a good movie, and this one is no exception.  The characters are all played by excellent actors and the plot will keep your interest until the end credits roll.  If you're looking for some good Sunday afternoon escapism, you need to rent this movie.  You won't be disappointed.

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I saw Andrea Bocelli on PBS a few weeks ago and thought this was the most romantic album ever.  It makes me think of my stepdaughter in Naples and the love she has for her husband.  The Italians are a very romantic people.

B000KZ3BWE|5.0|The original wake up call on Climate Change.  Still relevant.  Still an important message concerning the consequences of Global Warming.  I believe that it is an important time to watch this again or for the first time.
0385349947|3.0|\\"The promise of equality is not the same as true equality.\\"<br /><br />This is one of those times I wish there was a half star option. This book is easily a 3.5 stars; 3 stars is too low and 4 stars is too high.<br /><br />In this book, Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, speaks to women and men of the world about women in positions of power and how we can go about changing the mostly masculine face of upper management.<br /><br />I know some have critiqued Sandberg because of her privilege and the fact she spends this book focusing on what women can do to rise up in the leadership ranks instead of what society should do to be more accepting of women in power. For the former, I think Sandberg is using her position of privilege to bring attention to the injustices against women leaders and is like a spokeswoman to a new generation. Yes, she is lucky to be where she is; she even basically admits that in the book. But I felt she understood that many women aren't as lucky as she is, working for employers who understand her situation and are willing to stick their necks on the chopping block to push women through promotions. And honestly, unless we have privileged people speaking on the average woman's behalf, we will NOT see any change!.<br /><br />As for the latter, Sandberg addresses this clearly in the Introduction. She explicitly says that women shouldn't have to be doing all the changing, that society should be accommodating women in the workforce, but that this book's goal was giving women the tools to get into leadership positions NOW while also working on changing society's views.<br /><br />That out of the way, I found the book an odd amalgam of empowering, encouraging, and boring. Sandberg (and coauthor, Nell Scovell) bring a lot of research to the table in this book but also aren't afraid to add some personalized anecdotes. I felt really encouraged to succeed at my own workplace. Also, I liked how Sandberg avoided doing what many other feminists have and bash Republicans or those with conservative viewpoints. Yes, those groups tend to be traditionalists and do plenty of stupid things, but I don't think bashing them and making jokes off them helps your case.<br /><br />However, towards the middle (particularly the \\"balancing family and work\\" chapters), I found myself bored. Maybe it's because I don't have a family to balance, maybe it's because I'm tired of hearing the same basic ideas, or maybe it's because it was presented in a dry way. I don't know, but I struggled to get through this slim book because of it.<br /><br />In some ways, I felt this book would be a better encouragement to women in business than in any other field. Or maybe that shows my lack of knowledge about my own career field, but some of the concepts seemed more applicable from a business perspective than an engineering one.<br /><br />And while I almost never do this, I must talk about book length. Minus the notes and acknowledgements, this book is a brief 172 pages, which makes the hardcover price of $24.95 like highway robbery. At least the proceeds are earmarked for helping women in leadership???<br /><br />In short, I got a lot out of this book and definitely enjoyed reading it. Sure, it wasn't the most comprehensive work on the subject, but I liked the tone and really wanted to push myself in my career. If you are balking because of the price, check it out at the library, but don't be afraid to give this one a read.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Amazing, secret operation about the &#34;other&#34; US hostages in Iran.  The &#34;best bad idea&#34; that seemed so implausible that it actually might work.  Even the first two minutes so clearly painted the history behind the Iranian Revolution.  And especially refreshing to see how an intelligence operation without the use of any force whatsoever was able to succeed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game!  When ever I am waiting in a Doctors office, Hospital, any time I find my self waiting with time on my hands I play<br />it.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I'm a Roku renter, and I tried to rent this from Amazon but first my &#34;password&#34; wasn't right, repeatedly, so I reset it. Then the &#34;payment information&#34; wasn't right. That was all, so I gave up and rented this on VUDU instead and paid the $3.99 or whatever fee, and of course Amazon charged me. This happened when I tried to rent Sinister too, there's no point in trying to get your $$$ back from Amazon either, they just cry about it so fine, keep the $3.99 for two movies I never got to watch because &#34;your service&#34; stinks. Not my fault. DON'T RENT FROM AMAZON MAN.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When my inexpensive little calculator gave out, I went looking for one for my Kindle.  I found this app very quickly -- it is perfect for my needs.  The keys are large enough for almost anyone's fingers, and you can't beat the price!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Extremely well done and riveting. The details, the emotions, the characters were perfect. Everyone should see it and know about this event in history.

B0080K3G4O|4.0|An excellent read that will provide me ample opportunity to think and reflect upon in the coming days and weeks. An older gentleman shares his mantra of &#34;everything in moderation&#34; with me every time I see him, and Burkeman's book echoes that same thought. Rejoice in a life more simply led; breathe and don't take events, or yourself, so seriously. This will be a book I recommend to many people I live and work with...in hopes that we can all enjoy each other's company just a bit more.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I'm glad for those who seem to have loved this game.  I have had a different experience!  I can't go further in the game because I can't get past the robot and have no way to skip it.  Many of the other puzzles are easy and therefore not impressive.  And the idea of starting a section over is not appealing.  Shouldn't this game be fun?
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Very slow movie.<br /><br />Had some decent parts but for the most part it was hard to keep watching it was so slow...<br /><br />Some interesting info historically but overall it wasn't one I'd watch again...
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I am so looking forward to watching the movie now. Thought the book was brilliant and hope the movie lives up to it.<br />Was advised by a good friend to do the book first. So lets hope the movie is as good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have a few bible apps on my phone and I use the for the small differences they have. But I simply keep coming back to this one. Great UI... lots of free tranlations/versions that you can even download for offline reading... awesome bible plans &amp; notes. Youversion is my favorite book in the world done well!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I literally couldn't stop playing this. It's a great time killer. It is a little short tho. I did it in a few hours. I've played it twice now and there are different things every time you play which I really like. The graphics are amazing and really creepy. This game is AWESOME and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|The quality is not so good as I expect. For a DVD, I expect the video have more clear and sharp image.  Despite of that, I still can recommend the dvd for other customers. I do not expect Blu-ray quality ( its a dvd!), of course, but  I have some dvds that I own here that have much more sharp video that that edtion. The studio which mount this dvd should, maybe in other dvd disc release, put more quality on the video. Thanks for all you time.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If you don't mind explosions, corny lines, corny fight scenes, and get ready....CHUCK NORRIS cameo, then this movie is right for you. I sucked it up and watched it for the sake of loving most of these actors but the movie was mediocre in plot.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I remember watching Once Upon a Time and Grimm last year. And when I saw the pilots for both shows I realized Once Upon a Time was my fairytale show. I love how the writers twist certain things around. And I also love that this is a fantasy show thats not about vampires. The first season is about the Evil Queens curse and how it ripped our favorite characters away from the Enchanted forest into our world and they don't remember who they are. Now its up to Emma the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming to break the curse. It was hard to pick a favorite episode. I definitly love how we see Snow White and Prince Charming meet for the first time in Snow Falls. There might have been 2 episodes I didn't care for and that was The Price of Gold and Skin Deep. I didn't like that Rumplestiltskin was mixed in with Cinderella and was the Beast in Beauty and the Beast. I thought it was a little too out there. I don't count Rumplestiltskin and Belle as Beauty and the Beast I just count it as Rumple having a love intrest. But regardless of Rumbelle I still love the show anyway. And if I could give this show a grade it would be an A-. If you love fantasy shows give Once Upon a Time a chance. My grandfather didn't think he'd like it but I got him hooked to this show since last year. My moms side of the family are huge Oncer and a few of my friends are huge Oncer fans like I am.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I choose this rating because I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It kept me interested.  Love the style of writing, the tempo was good and there were no slow parts or parts you have to slog through to get to the good stuff.  The entire book is good stuff! It was a fun and exciting ride.
B00A3ZAE4O|5.0|This was a great chick flick.  A remake of a foreign movie titled Mostly Martha I found the english version not only better acted but also the technical aspect of the film as well.  This is the kind of movie my wife likes to curl up on the couch next to me and watch on a rainy night.  It is part of our video library.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I loved this movie, at times it did seem a bit dull, but it picked up and my students enjoyed watching this film during our Easter party.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book<br /> is really exciting but before you read this you need to read the Percy Jackson series and the first two books in this series to get the full effect.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Mr. Martin sure knows how to throw a curve ball. You think you know where the character path is leading but you have no idea until Mr. Martin get there. Makes for you your toes reading.
B00B2270P8|5.0|Ok this old Marine is a Twilight fan.  I cant help it I like the story.  Is it the best performance by actors that I have ever seen...No probably not but they are young and are just starting their career so give them a break.  My only complaint with the original version of this movie was Part 1 was poorly directed.  It wasnt the actors fault it was the directors fault.  However this extended version makes up for it with a couple of good scenes which never should have been deleted to start with.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This NEEDS a sans serif font option. I hate Droid Serif font and this is the only option for this app. Every other ebbok reader app has a font changer built in, it's time this one did too!

B007SGM084|4.0|I had heard a lot about these books and I wasn't sure it would be something I would like to read. I was wrong, they are well written and keeps you wanting to read more.
B007SGM084|4.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is an interesting book. The first book is a little slow when it firsts start. I was pleased with my purchase! I usually read urban fiction but this book has broadened my future reading selections.

B002JOUNDY|4.0|This version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein best captures the pathos in her novel and, despite mixed reviews, remains one of the best adaptations of her novel.<br /><br />Frankenstein was conceived by Mary Shelley during a challenge by fellow members of her literary club to concoct one of the most terrifying stories ever told, and, after a dream, Mary Shelley arrived at the idea for a story which she transcribed in the written form which will become known as a horror classic called Frankenstein.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the attempts of Victor Frankenstein at bringing to life an animated creature comprised of sewn body parts of various newly deceased individuals, whose body parts have been dismembered by him in an attempt to harvest body parts, brought to life through a surge of electricity obtained through lightning.<br /><br />The creature, thus, brought to life is pathetic and Victor abandons his research. Little known to him, the creature has survived but with no working knowledge of how to survive in a harsh and unrelenting world, he finds himself persecuted and ill-treated at the hands of his fellow humans, only to find refuge in a pig sty where he feds on fodder meant for swine, and, hence, developing a fondness for his saviours only to find them turning against him in revulsion to his appearance.<br /><br />Unable to contain his rage, against humanity, he searches for Victor in an attempt to induce his creator to create a companion for him, who being comprised of sewn together body parts like him, would be able to accept him as her lifelong partner, only to find Victor changing his mind at the last moment due to the fact that the monster had chosen his close friend, who was wrongfully hung for a crime committed by the monster.<br /><br />This results in the monster taking revenge on Victor and ripping out the heart of his wife on the day of their wedding, spurring Victor to reanimate his wife after sewing her together from body parts of innumerable women, only to find the monster vying for his wife's affection and causing her confusion in deciding between the two. In the tug-of-war between Victor and his creation, his wife, finding herself infuriatingly caught between the two, ignites herself through the bursting of an oil lamp and is totally consumed in flames. This ends the tragic tale full of pathos. Surely the best adaptation of Frankenstein to ever hit the big screen.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, from the detail of the characters, their witty remarks and the sure ease of read. I found it hard to put this book down - it just felt wrong. The characters hold their own with such vast differences and sometimes seemingly defects that I found i could relate to some of them in many ways. I greatly admire both Darcy and Elizabeth equally and favour neither over the other. I also find myself relating to the worries of Mrs. Bennet - and over time, though she seems very much a pain to Elizabeth and the family, she does justice to them all as a mother. Her sole focus is the attention to her children and ensuring that they marry suitably and are secured for the future - though for her, this security is based around financials. Mr. Bennet is a very &#34;chilled&#34; guy, and his character really does reduce the tension that plagues the family. He also relates incredibly to Elizabeth, and is proud of her independence - I think he sees a lot of himself in her! I could go on and on about the story, but to all who have read it will understand and to all who haven’t and are planning too, I envy you. In any case, this book is by far, my most favourite book. Period! And now that I have written this, I think I will read it again...and read it annually as well!
B005XI94HY|4.0|She says, not as good as the first but it's still Florence. Some not so great songs here and there.

B004J64QSI|5.0|I first watched this as a PBS special. I wondered how it would be since it was just the singing and not the actual<br />play.  However, it was an incredible experience with the beautiful voices...well, except the Jonas Kid, that wasn't a<br />smart move.  My favorite song of the musical has always been &#34;Bring Him Home&#34;.  I've not heard a better version<br />of this song until I heard Alfie Boe sing it on this night...wow.  Les Mis music always gives me chills and moves<br />me deeply.  This did not disappoint.  I loved it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|It didn't blow my mind, but the new characters and storylines were interesting. Still not quite as good as season 2 for me. Glad to see Coach!

B008ODZUN2|4.0|While nothing outstanding, it did burn some time that I had available with no other clear projects in view at the time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is excellent. I first read them in hardcover, and leaped at the chance to get the three books on my KindleFire. One of the best books I've ever read, they tell a riveting and compelling story of a young woman's fight literally to the death against the Bad Guys, who are in charge of a frightening world. Couldn't put any of these books down once Id started reading. Highly recommended.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|When it works it is great, but I feel like it crashes and freezes a little more then most of the other social networking apps. Also doesn't self update so I end up where ever I last was and have to scroll all the way to the top, and when you do refresh it takes too long. But it is the best twitter app out there, just not so good for the kindle hd, works better on my phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So many emotions in this book. I can't even begin to explain them all. Such a great story and storyteller.  Loved all the symbolism and words that just painted the pictures, thank you Colleen Hoover for a great read!
B009JZVT70|5.0|A fun series for all ages that captures your imagination and accesses remote memory banks while uniting with the present.

B0000029J5|5.0|This proves you're never too old to learn something new.  I'd heard &#34;City Boy&#34; -- on some soundtrack to some tv or doc, or episodic, or movie, or something, which I've forgotten now.  (I've tried every which google to learn which show it was, but so far, no luck.)  But when I first heard the song, I knew I had to have the cd . . . of . . .who?  Keb 'Mo??  Who was that?  Not realizing that I'd already heard and enjoyed a lot of his music on other soundtracks.<br /><br />Anyway, this music is sooooo gorgeously beautiful and meaningful.  I know I'll be enjoying it a lot.  And for a long, long time.<br /><br />Thanks, Keb Mo.  You're amazing.  So this is the first of a lot of music of yours that I'm going to get.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and while I could only get a used copy, I must say that the seller was excellent, and the cd in great condition and it arrived really fast.  Thanks<br />M.M.<br /><br />MM

B005MMYT76|5.0|I love this movie but it has to be your type of thing. It is really weird but in a good way. I found funny but it also a little bit dark. Not good for children.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|Too drawn out and boring at times, Family connections also confusing - too many characters.<br />Sorry line is good and the Nazi issues make one all indignant again - but frankly speaking, we been down this road too many times now I for one have had enough.
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|This was my first purchase from Amazon. It could not have been easier. I was able to find a brand new unopened copy of this cd for next to nothing.  I have and will continue to use Amazon for all of my cd, game, dvd, book, etc. purchases.

B003JTHWJQ|1.0|The author Richard Dawkins appears to be a extremely ignorant man who is very narrowly and very poorly educated (rather stupid) and lacks intelligence on the subject of God. Stupid is a stupid does! Incidentally, it has not escaped the notice of logicians that omniscience and omnipotence are mutually incompatible. If God is omniscient, he must already know how he is going to intervene to change the course of history using his omnipotence. But that means he can’t change his mind about his intervention, which means he is not omnipotent. Now it is true that God being omniscience means that he is all knowing, therefore being all knowing would mean God would be flawed and in error to change his mind after having absolute knowledge, therefore it would be impossible for a all-knowing God to ever have a need to change his mind on anything and that my friend would make him all-powerful as he can do all that is in his will; and that he will do! God's omniscient and omnipotence would certainly be in conflict if a need arose to change his mind. However a true conflict would need to arise not an invented contrived hypothetical because Dawkins wants God to be in conflict with himself when he is not in conflict with himself. So that Dawkins  may create the false premises of an omnipotence paradox when there is not one. Self conceited people that must have everything hammered on their own anvil are generally very ignorant people from such a deeply constricted mind!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Bought the Kindle version of &#34;The Martian&#34; by Andy Weir on the recommendation of my son, and I absolutely loved it.  My science fiction tastes run mostly to the &#34;hard&#34; side - I tend to avoid fantasy and prefer themes that address science or technology in some novel new way.<br /><br />This book grabs you from the very start during a near-future manned mission to Mars.  The mission commander makes the decision to scrub surface activities due to an approaching sandstorm, and in the trek from their surface habitat to the lander, one of the party is swept away into the storm by debris and wind. After a fast and futile search, the commander is forced to take off with the remaining crew before the lander is disabled by the storm.  Of course this sets up the main plot where the lost crewman did not actually die and later regains consciousness realizing that they are now stranded on Mars with the only hope of rescue four years into the future when the next Mars mission is scheduled to land.  With food for only a single year and very limited resources, what do you do?  Is there any possible way to survive?<br /><br />Told with a fresh writing style and a nice touch of humor, you get the story from the point of view of the main (stranded) astronaut, the people at NASA, and the rest of the crew on their way back to earth.  How do you get rescued when everyone thinks you are dead?  The plot develops with excitement, nice doses of plausible science, humor, and tension.<br /><br />The ending is letter perfect.<br /><br />If you are a fan of real science fiction, do not miss this book.  I haven't had this much fun reading sci-fi since James Alan Gardner's &#34;Expendable&#34;.

B003U0AHBO|1.0|I just received this DVD from Amazon and am so dissappointed.  The subtitles are so scarce, I cannot understand the dialog.  I am hearing impaired and always need either CC or subtitles.  In this DVD there are no subtitles for most of the dialog.  Usually satisfied with Amazon, but not in this case. I can't give the product any stars, but gave it one for promt delivery.  [[ASIN:B003U0AHBO Robin Hood (Single-Disc Unrated Director's Cut)]] Complete waste of money for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was kinda a drag getting started. If you're not a fan of the first book, I recommend  sticking around. The books do get better. I don't like how repetitive the author uses words, and it's like that through the whole series. I also found the characters are similar to Twilight, as well as the locations mentioned in this book.  That was kinda annoying even though I'm a huge Twilight fan.
1439127727|4.0|This is a fascinating book.  Rich not so much from the historical facts as from a combination of information, presentation and insights.  Other reviewers make some salient observations.  The club metaphor is an over statement that does not serve well as a title or a theme.  Only post FDR presidents are discussed.  Not a whole lot of facts that are not well known to readers already familiar with Presidential history.  Nevertheless this is wonderful reading for all history and political science enthusiasts.  I particularly enjoyed the insightful observations about the interactions between  Nixon and LBJ.  If you are old enough to remember reading about these events in the news as they unfolded, the book has the added benefit of reminding us that so much of what we hear and read is incomplete, filtred or spun so much that first impressions of the news are often vastly different from the historical understanding that can only be realized with the fulness of time and disclosures.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My only concern is how long it has taken Mr. Martin to write subsequent novels.  I am in limbo waiting for the sixth book.  His characters are so engaging.  I am thrilled also with the TV series.  The choice of the actors to portray his characters are excellent especially Peter Dinklage as Tyrion.  It is a very tough role to play.  I was concerned at first but now in the third season, I am so impressed that I have no fingernails left!  When will the sixth novel be out?

B00A757EFW|5.0|Takes getting used to controlling via the button on the screen but once you've mastered it, it'll be like old times.  Only frustrating thing is that it stops you even before you get to the 3rd level since it's a free-app.  At least let me finish the 2nd level then stop me.  $3 gets you the full version.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I love NCIS: Los Angeles. The team is great and they always have each others backs. They understand each other so well that there is like an unspoken communication going on half the time and I love how Kenzie and Deeks have this sort of romantic sexual chemistry and I really hope they get together. They played married on an episode and they did it so well that it was believable. It is a great show and of course Hettie with her various names and identities and the fact that she knows everything kinda like Gibbs in NCIS but shes even better because she has her hand in everything and even though it seems like people are trying to get her pushed out shes way too tough and smart to leave because the team needs her.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|My favorite show on tv.. Interesting characters, situations, plots. Good staging, good writing.<br />Eager to see what happens next in the plot.

I have felt lately that the Harry Hole books have become wildly improbable and convoluted (what with the avalanches and volcanoes).  \\"Phantom,\\" however, has the opposite problem.  It's a pretty standard, mundane police procedural, with a few twists and turns, but there's not much there there.  The Rakel/Oleg storyline has long worn out its welcome, as far as I'm concerned, so I had little invested in Harry's desperate efforts to prove Oleg innocent of murder.  The plot shows little of the eerie originality Nesbo has displayed in the past, and the supporting players are rather dull and uninteresting.  All in all, I appreciate that there is less melodrama in \\"Phantom\\" than in past Hole books, but if this were the first of the books I had read, I doubt I'd be in any hurry to read any further.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Great Family movie!!! Beautiful shots of surfing and the beach. Great character building for the 2 main male roles, but not so much for the females who had supporting roles. (Hence the reasoning for the 4 star rating.) I truly enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it again.  *** SPOILER ALERT****<br /><br />Ending is NOT for the faint-of-heart, be prepared to tear-up. But it does show the power of the human spirit and how when someone puts their mind, heart & soul to something or someone, ANYTHING & EVERYTHING is possible. If you enjoy movies like Rudy then you will like this. Both based on true stories and events, both the underdogs of life, and both characters are full of tenacity.
034580404X|5.0|Love it. These book will keep you reading. Time will fly if you have this collection. Once you start reading you can't syop
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|This is one of Dido's best albums I believe.  Her voice & lyrics are great.  If you don't like this album then you are not a fan of Dido.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this for my 6 yr old niece and with her sheer eagerness and joy when playing the game it is hard to tear her away from the game to reclaim my tablet. She absolutely loves it and is good at it too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible allows you to choose which book of the Bible, it allows you to pick the chapter and then the verse. You can go to exactly what you want to read in seconds. I have another Bible on my kindle that I paid for and all I can do with that one is pick the book of the Bible I want and then scroll and scroll and........more scrolling until I get to the chapter I want. The only con I have noticed with this Bible so far is, you cant read this Bible if you dont have a connection. And that to me is not a big deal considering almost anywhere you go now, there is free WiFi. Love this Bible
B004G6009K|5.0|How can you not love Tangled?  This is great to have it on DVD/Blu-ray and a digital copy.  Especially before Disney puts it back into the &#34;vault.&#34;
B000077VR3|1.0|Dire.  Bad.  Dreck.  Unwatchable.<br /><br />And those are the BEST things i can think to say about this ... thing.  I'm pretty sure that if i used more accurate descriptive terms, this review would be banned.<br /><br />We got through maybe twenty minutes of this horror before i stopped it  If i had made the mistake of purchasing the disk, i would have physically destroyed it to make sure that i never accidentally played it again.<br /><br />As it was, since it was a Rental-Service-Which-May-Not-Be-Named-In-Reviews-On-Its-Own-Site disk, i had to be satisfied with yanking it out of the player, shoving it in its envelope, and RUNNING to the mailbox to start it back on its way.<br /><br />I truly wish i could give zero - or even negative - star ratings; i would if i could, as a warning, because your quality of life will be made noticeably worse simply by inserting it in your player and pressing \\"Play\\", let alone the damage that woul be done by actually watching it.
B008OE05IG|5.0|This was such a treat. The dedication of Jiro and his sons was amazing to watch. Besides the whole culture was interesting.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. Very intense battles. Great for passing the time and this game is one of the best war games I've played.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I love this movie. It is snarky and witty, completely unbelievable, and has Emma Stone. The parents are one of the greatest parts - their entirely unrealistic parenting style put aside, they are hilariously funny, and Emma Stone's character has a fantastic comedic interaction with them.<br /><br />This is an all-time favorite. I actually own it, and I dont own many movies.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry, we love this game now have it installed on all of our tablets.  Great family game to play.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|I SAW DIO FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THE LAST IN LINE TOUR. IT BLEW ME AWAY AND LONG LIVE DIO.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Parents be warned that not only will their kids love this game but they may get highly addicted to it themselves! You may want to have numerous electronics with this game downloaded so kids and parents won't fight over who gets to play first!
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I like this movie. It's decent. But I just dont have anything raving to say about it. I probably would rate it above that Katie Holmes Superman movie a few years back, but not anywhere near Avengers, Spider-man, etc. Not even the same league as Batman. And for simple fun action hero movies, I would usually go Thor before the Iron Man saga.<br /><br />Not badly done, though, and Robert Downey Jr's witty comedy is always a good laugh.
B00418NXBK|3.0|Being a longtime fan of KOL I have purchased every album they have come out with and have enjoyed them all. It's great, mellow driving music!<br /><br />THis album was my least favorite due to the style of music prevalent on this cd (country/pop.) While I read in an interview with Caleb that the band was trying to express that they could play many different types of music, I felt it strayed a bit too far from that bluesy rock that they became famous for. I personally like AHA SHAKE and YOUTH AND YOUNGMANHOOD the best but this still is a definite must for the true KOL fan and features several exceptional songs as well.<br /><br />All in all a 3 out of 5 due to the country/pop feel of the majority of the album, still a great album
B000001FOS|5.0|YNGWIE WILL AND WILL ALWAYS BE THE NEO CLASSICAL DEMON GOD OF THE 6 STRING, NO ONE EVEN COMES CLOSE TO HIS ABILITIES AND CHARISMA.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Livy jumping from the roof, doing a Jackie Chan stunt, onto an outside fire escape ladder deck was how the show liked to present itself. Bad a$$ and got me hooked.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season of the Walking Dead really prepared me for the impending zombie apocalypse. I feel more prepared to do what it takes
6305308659|5.0|I had Pleasantville in VHS format and wanted it in the more durable DVD format for my personal film library.  I love the time travel genre.  It's a classic.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint loves to portray characters who feel righteous indignation then turn the tables and crush the bad guys. If you like to see right overcome wrong this is a movie for you.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Like I said I do like the floors and doors escape and I don't deslike anything about it and I would tell my friend about it
B00300EI3W|5.0|this should be required viewing (a la Kubrick's &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34;) for all who believe that the US system of healthcare is the best it can be. You probably are too proud to sit and watch it all the way through though and so I won't hold my breath for that to happen. For those of us who have been abused by the insurance industry, we know that this movie hits way to close to home for comfort. We need to make changes by adopting best practices from healthcare systems around the world. This movie can suggest where to start!
B00866JL96|4.0|Zak Ephron is more than a pretty face.  He proved his acting chops in The Lucky One.  We'll be seeing a lot of him in the future.
B000VZD8TO|5.0|This is the third time I have read this book and each time, I learn more about the meaning of our lives and what's really important for us to strive for.  I know I will read it again.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Torchwood is the more adult, and interesting spin-off of Doctor Who. The show is like a British version of X-Files, but with a sense of humor and irony mixed in with the mysteries and suspicions. The team face a series of dangers to humanity from both Earthly origin or from beyond.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|What a special get a way to the land of beauty, agility, excitement and sheer talent. Such a great balance of ballet, circus and beauty to send you away from the mundane and problematic work-a-day world. Definitely an Amazon special.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app exspeshly for horse lovers.it is so fun !you can do so much u get it!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great characters, interesting storylines.  And I love hate Vic - such a good guy, but can be so evil.  Brilliant!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House is an emotional look at slavery in the early 1800. Written from the perspective of a young Irish child, sold into servitude after her parents die coming to America, it twists your heart, opens your eyes and pulls you into the horrors of slavery. Easy and fast to read, I enjoyed the book.
0007413580|5.0|Oh the Places You Go by Dr. Seuss is a wonderfully imaginative look at the power one possesses within. It is a clear message to go out and reach beyond what you think are your limits. Not only a message to children and graduates, but the adult who doubts himself a little.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Any movie that can keep my little girls in the watching for almost 3 hours and not use the bathroom is a good movie.
B00756GRUE|5.0|Nice watch for the price.  Some reviews commented on the band.  It actually is quite nice and I have no issues with it being shiny in the middle part.  Its super accurate as most Seikos are.  Maintenance free is also a big plus.  Can't go wrong for under $200.  Love it!
B000E1YW0E|1.0|This story is so lame, it has to serve as testimony of where we are in American culture. People who can't pay rent living in spacious NY loft apartments. All clean shaven and well scrubbed actors, supposedly creative people &#34;living on the street&#34;. Yet, they miraculously always have a job when needed, safe shelter and plenty to eat. There are no homeless people over the age of 30 and everyone seems to dress well and have nicely furnish squatter's quarters. Perhaps one of the writers, directors or producers should have made a sharp left at their limo door, walked down a street that is not Broadway or inside of a theater and discover that &#34;homeless&#34; isn't a bohemian life style, but rather a dangerous, dirty desperate way of life. Boring look at the self serving, over indulgent entertainment industry. Come to think of it, third rate performances even as actors and singers and dancers and I don't care how many awards this pile of driven won.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|Great movie.. I think it did a pretty DECENT job relating to the 3RD silent hill game.. but yea.. I think that's about it
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Game of Thrones Season 2<br /><br /> I am not going to provide an episode-by-episode critique but just provide a few impressions and opinions of GOT 2.<br /><br />Costumes, sets, locations and attention to small details continue to amaze and provided this viewer with an absorbing viewing experience.<br /><br />While the actors selected for the roles continue to impress I still was uneasy with the men playing Jon Snow and Robb Stark. I think a more assertive warrior type individuals were called for in these pivotal roles.  My impressions have not changes after two seasons.<br /><br />Religion played a larger role - or at least it was mentioned more often. Old gods new gods we shall see who prevails.<br /><br />The fantasy elements were more developed in season 2. Most viewers are aware, I'm sure, there is a fine line between truly frightening images and just weirdness for weirdness sake. So far I have been impressed - in this area less is better, I say.<br /><br />We saw more damp, dreary courtyards and castles - after a while one looked just like another. Therefore I was so impressed to see the city of Qarth with it's tropical settings and brightly clothed inhabitants. I was hoping we would spend more time in the magicians tower but, alas, a fiery puff from Daenery's dragons put an end to that!<br /><br /> I do not subscribe to HBO so I am always a year behind the GOT released episodes. When I purchased GOT 2 it had been over a year since I had viewed GOT 1. I was lost! I did not want to jump into GOT 2 unless I was reasonably knowledgeable about who was related to who etc. I purchased and read an excellent guide \\"Inside HBO Game Of Thrones\\", not only was it lavishly illustrated but provided extensive background on the characters - more that you would learn from just watching the HBO films. Certainly I could have read the books, but then I would \\"know\\" what was to happen and that would take away from the pleasure of discovery.<br /><br /> Fortunate folks watching GOT3! Well I have something to look forward too in 2014. I read on the News recently - 4/3/2013 - the GOT has been renewed for a 4th season - great!<br /><br />Why 4 stars? Well, I found the 2nd season not quite as exciting as season 1.T3! Well I have something to look forward too in 2014.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|good time waster fun and interesting. haven't got bored yet that's good feet this app it is super fun interesting
B006LSZECO|3.0|really good story line but weak WEAK conclusion. disappointed by the drop off at the end. wish the novelty had made it all the way to the last page
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it, simple, good looking, 5 stars. I can't believe how simple it is!I just wish there was a way to make the Kindle charge faster.
B0095MVOMC|2.0|I'm a senior, my games are purely entertainment, no timers, but on this game, if you are hunting one number, with 2 minutes left, you get the &#34;times up&#34;.  It's infuriating.  No recommendations.  Two stars is generous.
B000SEH80I|4.0|This was a good bok that opened up new areas and ways of thinking. To be honest, I can't remember specifics but I know I liked it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Series delivered what I expected.  Ordered on advice of friends.  Have not yet completed watching  entire series, but expect to enjoy the rest as well.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I find this app extremely useful. It is so helpful that when your battery reaches 20% it tells you, that way if you are doing anything important you know to save your work. Also I find it great as it is very informative and tells you the amount of time you have left of battery life for different activities. Overall I would rate this app 5 stars and recommend it to anyone who has a kindle. One of the best free apps
B00364K6YW|1.0|Love story but this Dvd is not worth Mons.  Tried on 3 Dvd players and all had problems.  Could not turn off closed captions.  Could not go to disc menu.  Could not advance forward or backward. My advice is stick with original A&E production..  bought this enhanced version to replace original I had worn out... not worth the Mont.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I like the plan and find that it works well for me. The book is not written in the best way and I wish there was more material. It's a quick read.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I went to this when it came out, because the concept looked cool, even though the trailers for it didn't really sell me.  Critics were kind of \\"meh\\" about it, but the every person review said it was great.  I've learned not to listen to the critics.  I'm so glad I didn't. I was really blown away by this film.  Something about Jack's story of not being seen and not knowing your purpose in life, until you're called into action, that really spoke to me.  Was it the music pulling at my heartsrings?  Was it Chris Pine's terrific voic acting?  Was it the amazing character design and animation?  I've seen it 3 times since its release - twice in the theater and once now on DVD - and it's just as powerful each time.  This is one of the best film of 2012.  Don't let anyone tell you differently.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|The songs on this album-- showed anew side of where ----- JIMI might have gone with his sound -- GREAT PRODUCTION!
B005DJREJS|2.0|I'm not sure why I even thought about watching this.  I thought maybe it would be funny or something.  I couldn't make it past the first episode, so I'm not sure I can really rate anything but that.  Just wasn't for me.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I got this for my husband for his birthday and he gives it 5 stars.  Loves it and he is noncommental on most things unless he really likes it.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|some of the concepts are a little hard to believe and family dynamics are crazy but was a good read
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|THE LITTLE LADIES ARE JUST ADORABLE.  GAME PLAY TILES START OUT PRETTY EASY SO YOU MIGHT GET THE IDEA IT WILL BE BORING BUT AS IT PROGRASSES IT BECOMES MORE OF A CHALLENGE..BACK GROUND MUSIC IS SUBTLE  AND CALMING.  JUST A REALLY SWEET WAY TOO SPEND AN HUUR OR SO.  LOVE IT
B001ECDVKE|4.0|We grew up in Seattle where Sci-fi theatre use to air on Sunday afternoons.  This brings back all the memories of those old black and white films we grew up watching on rainy Sunday afternoons.  Even friends who aren't big sci-fi fans laughed during the movie.  This is the second one we have owned, we wore out the first one.
B000P407K4|5.0|I watch it at least once a year,so I'm biased.  I rest assured we have closed the mine shaft gap.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I think this app was up to date, very informative; I saw exactly what was coming my way and I felt and knew what to expect (hail anybody?).
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|LOVED THIS GAME GOOD GRAPHICS..NOT SO DIFFICULT THAT ONE MIGHT GET FRUSTRATED BUT CHALLENGING ENOUGH TO KEEP YOUR INTEREST.KEEP THEM COMING G5 GAMES.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Well written stories with developed characters that you learn to both love and hate. Lots of lessons to be thought about covering both people and society.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|It is better to hang on to when using my kindle. I can position by kindle horizontally  or vertically. I went with the dark color, it doesn't show any finger prints.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a very good tool for anyone that needs or wants to manage files on their Fire. Even if you just need to install a downloaded app. Simple file management.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After hearing Rodriguez's music in the movie &#34;Searching For Sugar Man&#34;, I was hooked. I listen to this CD all the time.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|After all these years, a week does not go by without my watching this movie version of the Phantom. I have 5 copies of this movie, 2 cd versions, plus an Amazon streaming version.  I still hope they will decide to make another one including the deleted song by Butler and also a commentary version.  Unfortunately, I doubt they will.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I personally enjoy this game because I love to ride and I have been begging my dad for a horse and he says no this is the next best thing for me and fellow horse lovers.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was great book and I they make another diary of a wimpy kid book and if they do that would be great.:)
0802473156|5.0|This book was great and it shows how people should communicate when dealing with the opposite sex.  Very clear and detailed for those that have issues in a relationship or marriage.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A friend gave me 50 Shades of Gray.  After getting over the initial shock of this type of reading, I was hooked.  I didn't hesitate to read the trilogy.  It has a plot which kept my interest.  After a while though, I skimmed through the &#34;details&#34; to get to the plot.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|when I updated twitter it changed my tucking password what the hell how do get on it now God dammit
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Watched the PBS special of the concert in Portofino, and it was magical at sunset being outisde in the nook of the port on the beach. Everytime I hear the CD, I can just close my eyes and feel the beauty and magic that was captured that night..Andrea's best so far, by far.
B00BR4QNJ0|3.0|this is essentially the same game as SAMURAI VS ZOMBIES 1 but with more characters, enemies, and even multiplayer! but then problems start to creep in, like most glu games, you can buy glu credits to advance much faster. But in multiplayer the &#34;power level&#34; doesnt associate with glu credits, which means you will fight somebody whom has several bonuses such as starting with full leadership, better weapons, stonger allies etc. so you will stumble upon people who will absolutly destroy you no matter how low their &#34;power level&#34; is. also at the higher waves, it becomes so difficult you HAVE to use glu credits to win!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wish there were more of these books, don't stop writing!  For the most part I couldn't put the trilogy down!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Thanks Amazon for a fun app......And free at that! It is a mindless way to relax. Try Angry Birds Reo too!
B00B769XB8|2.0|I saw this movie for free in theaters, and even then I'm pretty sure I overpaid for it. It's right up there with Van Helsing for absurdist 'historical' action movies that have nothing at all to do with anything other than spending a lot of money on special effects and giving American audiences a great time of lithium grade mental shutdown. You've got to be in that state, because otherwise you'll be as annoyed as I was with regular humans being able to smash through and off logs going at least 50MPH visually with only a small scrape on a body part entirely unrelated to the log smashing. Or the notion that insulin injections existed in dark age Europe. Yes, there's suspension of disbelief, but turning off one's brain completely that way is not usually what I find enjoyable in a movie.
B000002GJH|5.0|Chris Cornell was close friends with Andrew Wood, lead singer of Mother Love Bone, who died an early death due to an overdose; that's how Temple of the Dog began. This album pays tribute to the memory of Andrew Wood but at the same time, it combines members of Soundgarden and what was later to be Pearl Jam together.<br /><br />It's extremely surprising how great this album is and also surprising that it's not the trademark sounds of their normal bands all the time. There's a strong blues rock element here along with some classic 60's/early 70's style influence. Don't get me wrong, the whole \\"Seattle\\" sound isn't totally lost here. There's just something unique about how this flows together. Chris Cornell is definitely at his peak in terms of vocal delivery; his emotions probably fueled his performance even more.<br /><br />The last thing I'll say about this album is that you shouldn't pass on it because of uncertainty of how it might sound. It is definitely a classic and worthwhile.<br /><br />For fans of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, it's a no brainer. Buy it.<br /><br />For fans of the \\"grunge\\" scene, you may be surprised that this doesn't sound as much like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden as you thought. However, this is gold here and you can't go wrong.

B009LMTDL0|2.0|This was not at all what I was hoping for.  This isn't advice relevant to those who *have* to work, rather more for those that could survive without a paycheck if they had to.  Most of us don't have that luxury.
0817439390|4.0|Want to use the full capabilities of your camera? This book is a non-technical way to learn how to get great photos.<br /><br />This is a large format book, to allow you to see all the beautiful example photographs. Because of these large, beautiful photographs, there is not as much text as you'd expect for a book of this size. It's not as much reading as you'd think.<br /><br />The concepts and techniques of adjusting aperture, shutter speed and ISO are actually quite simple once you see them illustrated clearly as in this book. I was expecting that I'd have to take notes, but I absorbed the principles without reading systematically. I read this book in several sessions. I studied the photos and captions. Right away, I started to use the exposure strategies I learned. My photos are better as a result.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Online Resource: There is a website that expands on the book/DVD. You access the website by answering three questions about the content of the book/DVD. You must have it in your possession to answer the questions correctly. This is how the author of the book ensures that only owners have access.<br /><br />When you first come to the website of Perfect Picture School of Photography, you land on a page of videos that further illustrate concepts introduced in the book. You can also take an online course, for a fee. Seems like a great resource for those who want more.<br /><br />YouTube Channels: ppsop2009 -- and -- ppsop
B005GFPZYK|1.0|Honestly one of the worst books I have ever read. Very little variety in the writing style and vocabulry used makes for a boring read. Furthermore, his clearly politically incorrect and right wing views are unsettling and honestly, disturbing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What can I say?It is a great,working calculator.It can do whatever you need it to and does it accurately and quickly!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It's good. If you like action or science fiction, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's a bit hokey, but it's good fun and won't disappoint. It's nice to see a film that isn't trying to be a melodrama. Here's to more movies like this.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Kept my attention, had just enough factual, history content and just enough suspense. The pace of the movie was perfect.
B00BQUUH7E|2.0|Doesn't save options, eventually forces you to register with an email address (why?) which prevents the game from being played. However it is a fun game to pass time until it no longer allows you to play. Unless it is free, don't bother with this.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Every book in this series has been wonderful and it is still going.Everyone loves Percy Jackson!!!One of the best series ever!
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Originally this was show about zombies. Now it's just post-apocalyptic soap opera, plus zombies. Really, they could just cut the whole zombie part out, as it has no bearing on the characters or the plot, boring zzzzzzz.
0061997811|5.0|I got this for my husband after seeing it at a friends house. He is, as she is, a total HP freak. He loves it. It made the top, display shelf, of the bookcase.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|They are all great. Every episode is never dull.  I feel like each member of the cast is my friend.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes is an incredible book for everyone!Lots of awesome and suspenseful battles.Buy this book now!It is awesome and you will love it!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|It's not user friendly at all!!! Maybe to the one who designed it, it does. But for regular ordinary people, unless you are a computer savvy, The actions of the mobile Appt are rather difficult to figure out!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great fun. Works better with touch control at first. Once points are accumulated speed, bite,  and boost can be improved and the game becomes much easier. I love it - and I'm 66!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is a good show that makes you think. It has some emotional/romantic drama as well as lawyer twists that are intriguing. Good acting. I would recommend it.
B0012HEB32|5.0|I love Terminator so I thought this was so cooooool!!!!Any Terminator fan will love this series and it is worth the money.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This gives a good insight into the personal side of James Bond.  Still plenty of action, Bond fans will not be disappointed.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|If you are in this age bracket and have been married awhile and have kids, this movie will mean a lot to you.  If you are not in this position, I don't think you would get 90% of the movie.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|got  one set for myself and one for my daughter in law.. .beatiful notecards and extra pictures are enclosed... beautiful
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This is a fun little game, the graphics are nice and the levels are challenging without being too frustrating.  Definitely a good free game, though there are only 2 worlds with 100 levels each so if you get addicted you run out of New levels kind of quickly.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is the best movie musical I have seen!  I think I love it because it is all singing all the time!  Anyone who loves musicals would love this movie!!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I agreed with most people that the first book is a gripping quick read. Unfortunately it goes down from there. The second book was almost a repeat of the first and the third just drags on. I'm stuck in wanting to finish but I've thought about giving up on it a few times. Katniss' sour attitude, inability to communicate, and terrible self esteem began to wear down the reader.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Really enjoyed the series. There were serious moments as well as scenes that tug at the heart-strings. It is very easy to become attached to the characters and wonder what will happen next with them-Find myself thinking about Daisy and experiences she has had in her young life. Can't wait to see Season 3!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|its a nice way to waste some time.  It's a very addicting game to play, I like the sound too
B007BFSYMS|3.0|It's okay, nothing to write home about.  Tried it when I went to a hotel to help me sleep, Did not work well.  Not impressed.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Such a good read from start to finish. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the other books to see how the characters' stories continue.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game!!!<br /><br />Love it ! My wife and I battle at who has the top score<br />I'm having a problem upgrading the app for some reason
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Action-packed, fun viewing, Bond-as-Superman.<br />Enjoy without expecting art.<br />I go on because twelve more words are required.<br />And now three.
B0087EACJK|3.0|It's okay, I mean I enjoyed playing it, but it did not set me on fire.  However it was a free app and a good value for a free app.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As a card-carrying introvert - and longtime disparager of those who &#34;can't stop talking&#34; - the minute I saw the title I knew I had to read &#34;Quiet.&#34; Every point Susan Cain mentions in her revelatory book exposed a pivotal chapter in my life: So that's why. And, by the end:  It's who I am. And it's OK. For a good summary by the author, view her talk at TED 2012.  August, 2015. I just finished reading &#34;Quiet&#34; for the third time. Five big stars, as usual.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|I was actually only familiar with the band when Manson did the cover song Personal Jesus with what little I still kept up with some of his music on yahoo launch.  News of Delta Machine came by in an amazon MP3 newsletter, and I was hooked after listening to the samples.  After the samples I checked out the full songs on YouTube and wanted the deluxe album. :D
1592402690|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading Geoff's book! He was there for an amazing time in Rock and Roll history... and Lordy, wouldn't we all have loved to trade places?<br />Well written, informative... but I had so hoped for some interior photos of the goings on. (New ones)<br />The cover photo was also less attractive than it could have been considering those ever-handsome faces.<br />Also... why was Ringo missing from the cover?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so addicted to this game, I can't put it down!  I even play it at my office during my breaks!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I have been a fan of Kenny Loggins for as long as I can remember and this new venture (BSR) is fantastic!!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I had not watched this series when it originally aired.  What was I thinking?  This is a top notch drama with great writing and cast.  It is a very gritty police drama.  It is hard to tell the good guys from the bad sometimes.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes good drama and crime stories.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I spend the warmer months camping in the Western USA.... So living outdoors a quick and reliable weather app is a plus on my Toshiba Tablet ... for planning when and where to go.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book about a boy who is always being teased by other people about his face.  I gave Wonder 5 stars  because it was so happy,sad,upsetting and forgiving.  I loved how much this book could relate to your life.  I learned that you shouldn't ever tease or doubt anyone this book will tell you the rest!  Wonder is the best 5 star book! : D
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Easy game to play. Me and my kids take turns playing the game. Fun for the whole family.  No need to spend money, many ways to earn gems.
B001USHRCK|5.0|The Market Village was a huge hit with my son! Although other reviews were disappointed with the packing of the pieces, my 12 year old enjoyed the more difficult task. Construction kept him busy for only 2 days but he was in his heaven. The village itself is amazing and we had a blast exploring all the details LEGO packed into the set.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|After watching the entire first series in rapid succession, I felt I had little choice other than to splurge the $20 + on series two...and I was not disappointed! Everything that I loved about series one was back in full force - the wit, the characters, and the stories were all up to par and better than ever. Having just reread The Hound of the Baskervilles, I had especial fun with that episode as I watched for all of the little references to the original. Great fun!<br /><br />Here is TV that one does not feel guilty watching - nor feel as if IQ is seeping away by the second. The scripts are intelligent, tightly-written, and strangely faithful to the canon whilst shamelessly altering it. I have not enjoyed television like this in years.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I couldn't even watch the whole thing.  It was boring and not funny at all.  It shouldn't even have the movie &#34;Knocked Up&#34; associated with it.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|Overall it has very good sound quality, but lacks bass. My earbuds have more bass than this headphone. It leaks A LOT of sound. If you don't mind the lack of bass and you are looking for a good quality headphone, this is for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The storyline is excellent and the characters well developed. Daryl Dixon is by far my favorite character. Don't kill off Daryl!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved it! What a fabulous show. Constantly keeps you on your toes. I would definitely recommend this show. Try it!
0739309013|4.0|I love John Grisham and wasn't disappointed with The Last Juror. Only John Grisham can give you such characters rich<br />in personality and history. I got fast shipping and will buy again from this seller.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This was a great read. It's one of those books that you finish and set down and think about for days afterwards.
B00AG51V8E|4.0|This movie was action packed and had lot of suspense like other Bruce Willis movies.  The movie progressed in a logical sequence and had some interesting twists.
B000I5SY5U|5.0|Poignant tale of brash and vulnerable Sally Bowles--a role ideal for Liza Minnelli-- set in early 30's Germany as nazis rise in power. Artful interweaving of decadent cabaret performances (starring by Liza & with Joel Grey as m.c.) with personal story against the background of increasing influence and cruelty of nazis. Michael York also gives standout performance. The entire cast succeeds in portraying young people striving to live love and succeed in a harsh time and place.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I am almost done with this book and can't wait to start the next!  I love the characters created and the surprise turn at every corner!
B008HRZ4TK|5.0|This app installed, gave some very easy instructions on how to use then encrypted folders with pictures. The folders no longer show up on Gallery or file manager. Now if my Kindle is stolen or lost I don't have to worry. It does what it says so what else is there to say.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I had recently purchased a different name brand model, with many positive reviews, for my wife.  Shortly after I came and purchased this for myself.  I much prefer the use of this to that of my wife's.  The setup is simple as long as your are adept at reading concise instructions.  It's easy to pair additional phones.  It doesn't have the annoying tendency of audibly announcing turning off and back on again at random when not connected to a device (wife's does that).  This speakerphone is a great value and helps to make me feel safe while driving since a lot of my day is spent on the road.
B00008CMR6|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Classic John Wayne movie. Would recommend it to any one that is a fan of the Duke.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved it. Kept me on my feet the whole season. Graphics are great. Can't wait for the next season!!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show caught my attention when it first came on TV.  Every time I saw an advertisement promoting the show I would think, I really should watch that.  Well needless to say I missed the entire run of all seasons.  I was happy to see that I could watch this on my kindle fire.  I am only into the fourth episode so I am still at the point of not knowing the good guys from the bad.  I love it!  I recommend this series  to anyone who likes dramatic cop shows.
B006OAB2WK|5.0|On her album Visions, Vancouver's Grimes (aka Claire Boucher) manages to successfully meld avant-garde otherness and pop hooks for an entire album. The result will satisfy kids who are too cool for school, while songs like Obliviion and Be A Body would fit perfectly on a playlist that includes Madonna, Lady Gaga and Prince.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not the best James Bond flick I've seen.  They took out all of the funny, tongue in cheek quips that were typical of James Bond and made it just another spy/action flick....not sure is that was the point to make it more serious?
B009K0P10K|5.0|i've enjoyed the second season of revenge so far.  would highly recommend to anyone who has watched season one revenge
1452110581|5.0|Hilarious! Apparently more words are required for some reason.  I don't understand why.  Hilarious sums it up. The book is hilarious. What more must I say?
B0067FGYF2|5.0|On this her third album, Sharon Van Etten proves to be more than your usual female folkie. With subtle embellishments from working with producer Aaron Dessner of the National, Van Etten enhances the songs, creating the perfect atmosphere on this heartbreakingly beautiful longplayer. I got this one on wax.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|When the Disney Studios made this film, some people didn't like it because he was so much darker than the original 1938 movie.  That doesn't, however keep it from being a great film with a lot more of Oz in it than we'd seen before.  Mostly based on the book &#34;Ozma of Oz&#34;, we get to meet TicTok and Jack Pumpkinhead, and others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't wait for Season 4! This show is riveting and addicting. I hope Season 4 starts soon!!! I can't wait.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|I love these songs, this album is amazing.  These songs has helped me through a rough patch in my life
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters and Men is similar to Arcade Fire mostly in construct. But this Icelandic band burst onto the scene in 2012 with a sound of their own and an album that is chock full of catchy good tunes. Every song would be at home on a \\"best of\\" playlist. By far the best debut album of 2012.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|What fun it has been to read these wonderful stories that are for all ages, and never grow old.  Comes with my highest recommendation.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Birthday gift for son at polytechnic university, first he was amused and now he and the roomies are semi-obsessed.  It sits in the living room amongst the controllers..
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is a juice hog. So, I just plug into the juice as I play and we're both - me and the Kindle - happy. I have a horrible time with spacial puzzles, and this keeps me on my toes and it helps hone those skills. Nothing like making the brain behave and still have fun.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|My Facebook status after seeing this movie was 'Looper is a great movie with time travel done right!'  The acting is great and the story is engaging.  Definitely worth seeing!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice little solitaire game, unstressful and relaxing.  Everyone needs a good basic digital solitaire.  This is a pretty good one.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|I love the original animated version of this movie. This movie goes into a bit more detail and explains a few things better than the original version, in my opinion.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does everything the avarage artsie/fartsie math challenged 67-year old needs when the math genious/geek/spuose is not handy! Try It! You'll Like It. AND, IT'S FREE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoy Sci Fi and was the best one I've read in a while.  The quality + the price make this series difficult to beat.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great movie everyone should watch! Extremely knowledge on what we're eating and putting into our bodies! The inconvenient truth! This movie should be in theaters everywhere!
0061353248|3.0|Predictably Irrational is worth a read because it offers important insights into human thought process. The lessons Ariely provides on some fundamentally nonsensical aspects of our nature can help anyone make better decisions in terms of their health and wealth. At the very least, reading the book will make the reader cognizant of certain aspects of their decision making that have a far deeper influence on their lives than they think.<br /><br />However, the way this material is presented seems a bit amateur and unskilled. Ariely is, undoubtedly, a smart man and has gone through many interesting life experiences, but writing isn't his strong suit. He has important things to say but the manner in which he says them is rather pedestrian. For almost every hypothetical he offers, he begins by writing \\"Imagine that you are...\\" which is something I'd expect from a high school writer. His personal tangents, such as the appearance of his colleagues or the way his principles have applied to his life, fail to connect with the reader and add nothing to the substance of the text.<br /><br />Also worth noting is the shoddy research methodology of many of the studies he cites. The sample sizes Ariely employs are often unreliably low, and he fails to delve deeper than a surface treatment of the phenomena he explores. That is, he will often state that something does indeed happen, but will avoid speculation on the why and how of it.<br /><br />I almost wish a more adept writer had penned this book, but I'm sure Ariely wrote Predictably Irrational with a certain kind of audience in mind. To the average reader this book can be a game changer, and an enjoyable read. However, the devourers of prose, healthy skeptics, and scientifically literate may find his writing surprisingly clumsy and the substance questionable. Thus, while I found the lessons the book teaches worth learning, the way in which they were taught will make me avoid Ariely's other work.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Definitely a MUST read for ALL women, not just aspiring career women! Every woman will find herself in the pages at some point..
B00785P2QC|5.0|I'm really impressed. good game. good graphics. I like the fact it keeps running when the device sleeps. so up the good work. also make the invest points easier to get.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Amazing that only a few people realized the risk of credit-default swaps, and that the financial &#34;geniuses&#34; overlooked the obvious
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to kill with when you have nothing else to do. I highly recommend this for children..playing it for long period  of time will kill the battery. And it does freeze sometimes.
0316789704|4.0|My son did not like it that much as I thought though but it!s a nice book to give kids ideas as to how to draw faces...
B003TSEEDY|4.0|You have to get into the first few chapters for the book to really make an impact and keep you hooked. It was worth reading  though.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My 7 yr. old loves this game.  He has really mastered the game and now knows how to do upgrades.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Dealt with anguish and Catch-22 situations of aging with humor and compassion; no sacred cows. Funny, smart and full of heart.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|All I can say is wow.  When I first opened the package I had to ask myself, &#34;how much did I pay for this thing&#34;.  The SCHF9 is extremely well built, thick, sturdy, and feels great in the hand.  I would trust it to do about anything it was called upon to do.  This knife stays sold out on Amazon for a reason.  Buy one while you can at this price.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie.  The scenery was unbelievable.  I watched it two times.  The first time I couldn't really understand some of it due to the dialect.  The second time I watched it I used the closed captioning and understood a lot of what I had missed the first time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was great.  I hadn't had a chance to see it when it was on TV so I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0058W74UY|1.0|Have no idea how this is supposed to be used.  I was still unable to view some of my video that require a flash player.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you grew up in the 90's as video games were coming into being, Rock was still Rock, and movies were about kids like you, this book will take you back to your childhood and make you wish you could go back to the arcade with your quaters and waste away the afternoon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun to play and very addictive. Very good to pass the time with. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I loved this DVD,  his story is amazing and his daughters are also amazingly down to earth, just as Rodriguez is.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|This game is interesting but tends to be monotonous. If you want to do anything other than he a bacteria, you have to pay extra. Not cool when you've already paid for the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We all love it from my 7 year old son to my 43 year old husband!  It builds great hand eye coordination while having fun!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|good h/o game but gave it 4 stars for the simple fact that I ended up paying 4.99 to keep playing....once you start you just don't want to stop!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Who doesn't love this author and this ia a fantastic book. I highly recommend everyone read something by the King
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I beat the game in one day it was so easy they need a new app update  i don't know about you but i like temple run alot better and get kingdom's and lords
1878424319|5.0|Great source of backup info for companion book The Four Agreements... I am using it along with the other book to change my point of view of life.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Every song on this album is brilliant in sound and lyric! I love this album and cannot wait ..and hope..to see them live! Brilliant band with an addictive sound!
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|I really do like this movie, even besides the fact that I'm one of the extras.  It was fun, very fun to be a part of the movie, and get to meet the actors.  Especially enjoyed several conversations with Alan Alda, and Jennifer Aniston.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I give it 5 stars for several reasons!<br /><br />This show brings entertainment with a sense of &#34;finally someone is getting a little justice&#34;! Do you ever feel like there is no justice in this world? Do you feel like things just never seem to go your way and life would be better if just...? Well I think that we all get to have a little justice/fairness (at least mentally) when Emily, aka Amanda, gets even just a bit of revenge. Revenge works to describe this show but I believe it is fairness, the sense of right and wrong lacking in this world and country that makes us all want revenge. If people were treated fairly and not just given a &#34;sense&#34; of being treated fairly this world would be a lot easier to take. Since that is not likely to happen lets see Amanda get hers and see how much better she can make her life and those she cares for.<br /><br />The only dislike I had with the show was it went too long with Amanda not making any headway. Since my sense of justice is lifted mentally by this show a positive note needs to be made often even if it is minuet as long as you can see Amanda was lifted by whatever it is.<br /><br />Great show with great actors and actresses!<br />Thank you
0553801473|3.0|Read the middle 4 books of the Wheel of Time series again... and DON'T DO THAT.  I say this because you are well on your way to writing a WoT clone in a bad way - you started brilliantly but are now lost, characters are standing around saying \\"what's my motivation?\\" (you're a Hollywood guy now... you know what I'm talking about).  Dragons are on vacation in the hills, or maybe they stomped off to their trailer in a huff (of smoke).  Get Tyrion off his party barge and send him to a celeb detox program so he gets his personality back (worked for Ironman).  Get the wolves of Winterfell howling... you know they want to.  And tell me that Jon somehow survived his Et tu, Brute moment... because he's the only intersting character at the Wall right now!<br /><br />Don't follow in Jordan's footsteps and write 4 books where the characters do NOTHING of note (well yours do die, but that's not the kind of 'of note' I'm talking about)... you've got one already with aDwD, stop now!  You've got a LOT of ground to cover yet so start trudging, Winter is coming.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Enjoy this clock!  I use it every morning of every day.  I especially like that it gently wakes you up.  The alarm gets louder and louder slowly.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone. My mom and I watched the movie together  it was fabulous.  I love the movie i especially love all the actors. I liked it because it's amazing how the elderly woman opened the lady eyes and changed her to a happier more fullfilled person.  Great movie!!!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|First off the end is sad when a staple of many bond movies dies (trying not to create a spoiler).  Loved the movie, non stop action as Daniel Craig can only deliver!  Great addition to the Bond movies!
1592407889|3.0|The book was interesting.  Sometimes it was a little hard to believe some of the statements, but that would be for the reader to decide. It held your interest but just a little difficult to know if accurate.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|The story is great! The photography is very picturesque! Every Ben Affleck film never fails to entertain. He surrounds himself with great acting !
B006LSZECO|1.0|So sad how disappointing this book was. Unending vulgar language, sexous, misogynist characters, extremely disappointing ending.<br />Terrible waste of good earned money.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I bought this on a whim after watching people play it on Wong Fu Productions, and boy it was really the most board game fun I've had in a while. It offers a creative take on Pictionary, and I advertise it as &#34;Pictionary with Legos&#34; to most of my friends. Lots of laughs, many puzzling creations, and overall very good fun for all ages.<br /><br />One thing I would like to see though is more cards (as we've gone through all the cards really quickly).
1401937268|5.0|Very user friendly and easy to interpret ...I would highly  recommend this to not so serious readers. Five stars for this item.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I loved this movie!! Daniel Day-Lewis is deserved of the Oscar! Sally Field is great but understand why she never won it ! Historically accurate, reminds me of Obama`s current fights with the GOP!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun fun fun fun fun. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun<br />fun you have a horse and have fun
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the final book in the trilogy. After reading this book, I felt as though I could walk away without having looming questions of &#34;what will happen with them next.&#34; It wrapped up the story well and answered questions about earlier happenings in the series. In short, I loved it!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|app does what its supposed to do.  I use it on my kindle fire. I enjoy using it.  what else is needed?
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|that was the worst movie I have ever seen let alone one with Denzel Washington. I would not recommend it at all!!!!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|This man is pure genius! Super Talented! I love this album and I love JT! I just wish the album was longer. I like 8 of the 10 tracks which in my eyes is a pretty great album. My favorite tracks &#34;Don't hold the wall&#34; and &#34;Tunnel Vision&#34;. And of course, I love Mirrors. I hope JT doesn't disappear on us again! R&B and Pop needed you!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Absolutely love this game! even got my friends to pick it up! I just wish it had more levels. :)
B005K17RU0|5.0|The updated version is great.  Easy to use. Quick to find info. Accurate. Hourly info is very handy to have.  Nice to haveseveral cities so readily available at the same time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is the best version I have seen. The acting and singing are both very moving. I am not into musicals at all but this was an exception.
B008KW43TE|2.0|I was looking forward to this album but was very disappointed. I think the only two tracks that I like are Pyramids and Thinkin' bout you. Hmmmm, Frank, I expected so much more. Especially since his unreleased material is so much better. Glad I only paid $5 for this.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The songs were great. I am going to buy this movie and watch it with the whole family. I gave it 5 stars because my daughter was be part of the movie.It was hilarious and funny. Good voices and it was 'pitch perfect!'
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Great game until message about new version required to log in-gives no options-cannot play anymore.Very,very disappointed.<br />Hope the problem is fixed soon.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this series and wasn't too impressed with the first few episodes but as after about the fourth episode I got hooked and looked forward to each one after that. I recently finished season 2 and am totally waiting in anticipation of season 3. Season 2 had a great ending!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not put these books down.  I cannot believe I waited this long to read them! I recommend reading them now!
015206057X|5.0|I love this book, and my daughter does too. I had heard about it and its great reviews when I was pregnant, but forgot about it until I came across it at a thrift store. As it happens, anyone who reads my reviews will note that I get many of my daughter's books from thrift stores! Anyway, I have another book by Mem Fox that we really like so I decided to purchase this one as well. My daughter loves it! We have to read it over and over! The story is super sweet and the illustrations are beyond adorable. The only criticism I have is that the book is rather large for the actual story. There are like, 3 words per page. It could easily be scaled down to board book size without effecting the detail of the illustration. I do think its nice for my daughter to see big, detailed pictures, since she has so many board books... So its not really a big deal to me. She loves the book and that's all that matters really.<br /><br />A huge plus! This book basically has nothing in it that could be even remotely offensive to any reasonably sane person, so it would be a good gift for anyone having a child.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Although occasionally far-fetched, it's consistently entertaining and well-acted. Good performances. Delightful eye-candy for all. Intelligent and clever dialog overall. A real winner!
B00475BUVM|3.0|If you know the myth of &#34;Perseus and Andromeda&#34;  you'll pick the story apart like crows on a battlefield, but, the 3D effects were pretty good, but the Harryhausen version, story wise, is much better.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I have not read the other two books available from Landay, but ordered them after finishing this one.  The book uses an unusual style of split time chapters with current story lines mixed with the transcript of Jacob's father in a Grand Jury hearing.  the tale proceeds quickly and explores each of the characters emotions in the process of defending Jacob.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite and I owned the VHS version once. For the past few years I've caught it on network TV, commercials and all, on a time frame less than optimal. Now...wallah! I'll enjoy at my own pace without interruption! Also, arrived very quickly!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|First, you laugh, then you laugh some more, then you wonder, then you laugh, then your biting your nails wondering if things are going to work out, or if this book was destined for disaster, then you're laughing again, and then it's all over. Such a fun roller coaster ride, I think I may want to ride it again.
B003IMMEKG|3.0|Was nice to watch again after so long.  Arnold isn't an actor, but he does generate a presence and the story is watchable if you don't view it as serious cinema.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|My family likes this movie a lot; saw it several times at the theater and now purchased it.  We like how a lot of movies are being sold now in three-disc combos - my son, who has a 3-D TV at his house, gets the 3-D disc; I keep the Blu-Ray disc; and my daughter takes the DVD with her to college to share with her roommates.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Hilarious movie! Saw it in theaters with my daughter and bought it AS SOON as it came out! I am thrilled!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I liked this item because it was at a very good price. I also liked that it arrived on time.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie was nothing but shallow and crude. There are so many topics that could have made this movie funny and entertaining however everything was based on foul language and sex.  Absolutely horrible!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book based mostly on what others had written about it.  I was not disappointed in the least!  Wonderfully written book that had me on the edge of my seat.  Beware you will need a box of Kleenex when reading this.  So glad I came across this book!
B0031KE9C6|5.0|I've already seen Veronica Mars once and the second time is even better. The streaming quality was on par! You can probably buy it cheaper on DVD but I was impatient.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app better than the other ones. It seems to be more accurate and the graphics are better
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|i've always liked Jewels, but this adds another layer of fun with the two versions.  However, I run it on my Kindle, and it zaps my battery!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I made the mistake of reading the book before seeing the movie.  The book was excellent!  The movie was a bit of a let down after reading a wonderfully written book.  Definitely some twists and turns in the book I didn't see coming.  As always Nicolas Sparks has written another tear jerker without seeming corny.
0385349831|5.0|I am happy to be the first Korean reader to read Paulo Coelho's new book Manuscript found in Accra.<br /><br />I was surprised. It felt as if Senor Coelho had established his own religion for people living in this era. I had a feeling I was making conversations with him through my heart. I thought that the way people ask and search for answers when facing a war about to break out appear similar to the way people might have asked and found answers for themselves in tragic circumstances like the 9/11 terror attacks. This is when I understood the sentence \\"which are the values that remain when everything is destroyed?\\"<br /><br />I find that the basis for the 20 questions appearing in the book is from our \\"fear.\\" Fear of losing, fear of loneliness, fear of being unworthy, fear of change, fear of love, fear of the flow of time, fear of sex, and fear of obligations to support his family. For the fear, it gives people the reason to ask questions about successful people, about miracles and about their future. Fear and insecurity are emotions that seem to exist regardless of time. So naturally when everything is destroyed, the remaining values are no doubt ways to defeat \\"fear and insecurity.\\" It felt as though the author was trying to encourage readers to defeat \\"fear and insecurity\\" by seeking ways together with him. I do not think that the answer from the Copt - in other words, the author - is the one and only answer. I do not think that is what the author wanted. I feel that in the time and efforts of questioning and searching for answers, people find light and ways.<br /><br />Senor Coelho is already searching by himself - or together with readers - for values that give us strength in life through his blog and twitter. The form of arena is different, it is nothing like the one from the medieval times, but people continue to question and find answers through a new type of arena called social networking. With the answers \\"some will write down what (he) say(s). Others will remember (his) words.\\" They \\"will set off for the four corners of the world\\" and \\"tell(ing) others what (they) have heard.\\" I know that Senor Coelho is becoming \\"a centre of knowledge (...) again.\\" I hope Korean readers will meet this book soon\\".
B004AKCME8|4.0|I love CG movies and they tend to hold my little ones attention better than traditional cartoon movies.  I love owls and it has a cute story line.  I don't mind watching this one over and over.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on television.  It's smart, sexy, fun and dosen't take it self too seriously but comes off intelligent at the same time.  I can't wait until the next season arrives.  I feel like they are a part of my family.  LOL.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy playing with this app of solitare!  Versital game options is a plus. Can be both challenging or easy depending on your mood.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Got this for my son as a little surprise at the end of the Easter Bunny Egg Trail on Easter morning.  He was so excited when he saw it that he forgot about all the candy in the eggs (Thank you!).  A week later and its the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he puts down at night.  Super durable, easy for him to open/close, and a great price.  I only wish I had found it sooner, as we were looking for something JUST like this to put on top of his outer space birthday cake a few months ago.<br /><br />If your kid loves space as much as mine does, go for it, you won't be sorry.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|I love the impossible project, and I can't wait to take all the polaroid exposures with me to Europe in a couple weeks!
B0065GC0PG|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  As an adult who nominally likes YA, but has been disappointed quite a bit since The Hunger Games spoiled me... Cinder was a breath of fresh air.  Yes, it's a YA.  I would heartily recommend it to any teen or tween girl (I can only imagine how obsessed I KNOW I would have become if this had been around when I was a teenager), but it works pretty well for an adult audience too.<br /><br />The protagonist was great... not the mindless \\"insert yourself here\\" character we get so often in YA romances, but she's still vulnerable and feminine.  I love the fact that Cinder's a cyborg, I love the fact that she's a little bit vain and more than a little ashamed of it.  She's tough, but also vulnerable, and she definitely has her weaknesses but is a good person over all.  Someone you can identify with AND root for... in other words, an ideal protagonist and someone I won't mind my daughter idolizing once she's old enough to read!<br /><br />Prince Kai was refreshingly real as well, and unlike a lot of these YA romantic interests, we SEE him being a good person.  We see him doing things, being something other than \\"hot with a dash of dangerous,\\" and I like him a lot.  I like Cinder liking him a lot, and it's a lot more interesting to read about a potential couple when you genuinely want them to end up together.<br /><br />There are sad parts, there are funny parts, there are lines that sound like Jim Steinman should have written them (\\"Every muscle burning. Every joint screaming. Her body in rebellion as it discovered what had been done to it.\\"... oh yeah!), there are sarcastic androids and greasy old cars and cyborg hands, need I say more?<br /><br />I will concede a couple of points to the criticizers... I give this 5 out of 5 stars but it would maybe be 95 out of 100.  I do wish there was more of an ending to THIS book, although I don't mind it being part of a series.  And the Asian culture aspects are oversimplified and unrealistic... with relations between China and Japan what they are these days, the Asian Studies major in me would have liked to see more of an explanation as to how in the world the cultures merged together the way they did and became part of the same Commonwealth (is the Emperor a descendant of the Japanese Emperor?  What happened to the Communist Party in China?  Where's North Korea in all this?)  However... I do realize that this is a YA novel and that most readers wouldn't be especially interested in such things.  So overlooking those few little details, because they don't matter nearly as much as an engaging story and sympathetic characters, I give Cinder two cybernetic thumbs up!
B00BF123WG|5.0|Well done.  Movie was much better then I thought it would be.  I am sure it is a mix of real life and a little bit of movie magic.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|wakes me up right away on time every time, very reliable though it is annoying, but what alarm isn't? I will definitely keep depending on it to wake me for even the most important events!

B009RH9HDS|5.0|*UPDATE*  We've used our Kindle in this case almost every single day for 8 months and it still looks great and has held up fantastically!  I am happily surprised at the elastic band still having tension and not ripping off with so much use!  Love this case!<br /><br />I looked at a lot of Kindle cases and decided on this one for a few reasons:<br /><br />Price---I didn't want to spend a lot on the first case, wanted to see how we used the Kindle first.<br />Protection---My two kids will be using the Kindle a lot for homeschool and I would be walking around with it, so I didn't want the open corners that most cases have (this one has the hard plastic corners, the Kindle snaps into a plastic protective cradle).<br />Rotating---I use Pinterest (mostly for homeschooling and recipes) and wanted to be able to prop it up both ways.<br /><br />All three of the criteria were met and I really do like this case in this price range (the Amazon Kindle Fire HD case was the closest contender).  The Kindle hasn't been dropped yet (knock on wood), but it has been banged on the counter and the case held up to that (seems pretty strong).  I've used the swivel feature a few times and it definitely is very tight to turn, but I'd rather that than lose and falling all over.  The color is bright and cheery (but a lot more orange than the photo).  I love the hand strap, though it does make the case warp a bit like other reviewers have noted, but my Kindle turns off just fine (it only bumps a little bit when closed, not too noticeable, and having the Kindle feel secure in my hand while walking around the house is worth that little aesthetic issue).  I really wasn't sure about the elastic band that held it closed, or the fact that it is a trifold (because of that plastic protective cradle it sits in); however, I have had no problems with either so far (I also like that the strap can go backward to hold it open so the cover doesn't flop around).  I wasn't sure about the whole magnetic awake and sleep thing that almost every case has (thought it might be wearing on the Kindle) but I really like it now!  The power button is so freakishly small on the Kindle Fire HD (as well as the volume buttons) so being able to open the case (just like a book) and have it turn on is a convenient feature I've come to like a lot.  It is really nice quality with good features, especially for the price.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Entertaining action flick but not a great movie. Surprised it wasn't better given the list of amazing actors. Would not by on DVD.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|This is just a crude and foul movie that presents the most base problems of humanity without any of the redemptive provision of God.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This watch goes with me on all of my runs.  Very easy to use and very accurate.  Love how it links to online
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really makes you appreciate those who are most like yourself. Being okay with past mistakes. And moving on. There's more than just &#34;love&#34; in this love story. Needless to say, i cried, more or less sobbed. But it was a good cry. Anyone who enjoys drama, and love, this is a great choice. Must watch the movie now!
0688014291|3.0|The One Minute Manager has a few good nuggets of wisdom, but it hardly qualifies as a #1 bestseller.  As in \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" by Spencer Johnson, a few simple concepts are delivered by way of a fairly short story, but the story is not nearly as thought provoking or interesting, nor are the ideas particularly profound.  In fact, they seem somewhat outdated.  For example, touching an employee for any reason other than to shake hands would be ill advised in today's workplace, unless you don't mind getting slapped with a sexual harassment suit.  The manager in the story comes across as a bit condescending, and the frequent use of the word \\"reprimand\\" seems more applicable to an elementary school class room than a professional work environment.  It is a very short and easy read, so there's not much time wasted, but there's not much knowledge or wisdom gained, either.
B0037VNX44|5.0|Whether this character portrayed a person in real life or not, I thought it was a brilliant performance. Even comical at times. Thumbs up!
B008MZU8R0|5.0|Great album and the book that was written to go with it by Kevin J Anderson was phenomenal! , !
0770435726|5.0|A female CIA analyst, formerly an operations officer, happily married for 10 years with two kids, has kept from her husband the truth about her career.  She's always claimed her job is at the State Department, in a mundane research role.  When the husband informs his wife that he has an opportunity to take on a highly-rewarding contract doing IT security work for a bank in Luxembourg, which involves heading abroad almost immediately, Kate, his wife, decides to quit the agency, take on the role of full-time mom abroad and follow him into a new life course.  Kate struggles in the new rote work of an expatriate mom and wife, trying to adjust to days that are no longer filled with secrets other than her clandestine past that remains hidden from her spouse.  Almost immediately upon their arrival in a new land, Kate and Dexter Moore become friendly with another American transplant couple, Julia and Bill Maclean.  Dexter grows close to Bill, joining him for the frequent rounds of tennis.  Julia and Kate, are less close, but friendly if not suspicious of each other.  Kate soon suspects something with their new friends is not quite as they appear and she can't but help return to her intelligence-seeking ways.  Kate follows her suspicions, confronting and eventually questioning her most basic assumptions as well as her own deceptions.  The mystery unfolds almost from beginning to end.<br /><br />I cannot explain and am puzzled by the true lack of consensus in the Amazon reviews.  I for one found the novel to be very well crafted and told yet there are a significant number of 1 and 2-star reviews, much more than I would have expected.  Many of the reviews suggest it is a confusing read, the protagonist is ridiculous or the story line too unbelievable.  The time line does move around some, but not enough to be considered confusing for a moderately trained reader.  This is a common plot device in thrillers of this sort so I'm surprised many readers seem to have trouble with it.The story is told from the perspective of a woman, which may not be for everyone, but the tussle between being a mom, wife and woman into the story line can and does work in my judgment.  Lastly, while there are certainly some details of the story that are very unlikely if not nearly impossible in the real world, they aren't so far fetched as to make the story ridiculous in my view.  For instance, the financial and IT security bits, while surely contrived and not perfectly aligned with what experts in the field know to be likely, are within the realm of the believable for the layperson, which ought to be enough for a work of fiction.<br /><br />In summation, I thought it was a very enjoyable read.  Maybe you will too, but based on number of mixed reviews, perhaps read a sample before making the commitment on it yourself.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Didn't really know what this was about even though I have seen it advertised, but now that my husband and I are watching it the story is really great.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I like this game, it's like a build a village type game, except you have a limited time to complete your building tasks for each island.<br /><br />It does let you know in the description that you can pay to unlock the full game after you try it out, so it's not sneaky about it like some other free games.<br /><br />It really is a bit different than other games I've tried. I'm tempted to buy the full version after having the opportunity to see how it works.<br /><br />There are fun little characters running around to complete your tasks, the graphics are decent, it's good for kids or adults.<br /><br />Davemonster<br />dbn2019@msn.com
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Love the plot, with twists and turns, both humorous and touching! Can't have the holidays without it, it's a great movie!
B007GYM86M|5.0|I didn't trust Bob Woodward's &#34;Wired&#34; when I read it years ago. The tone was off, and it seemed deliberately to choose anecdotes that would show John Belushi in the worst possible light. A recent SLATE article by this books co-author alterted me to &#34;Belushi&#34;; I bought it, and enjoyed it hugely. Warm, affectionate, funny, but still warts and all. A great gift from his wife to his memory.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Computers that run for centuries without a spare parts store, but no elevator or even rope and pulley to hoist things and people up and down. No explanation of how one person (and several children) survived for 32 years in a mostly destroyed silo; no explanation of the other 48 silos. The protagonist burned over 100% of her body yet up and hugging people in mere days, walking down unassisted to the bottom of the silo despite the absence of a burn clinic or modern medical care of any kind. A phone system more like Pepsi cans with string attached linking all the silos through some underground wiring system that seems impervious to the years. The war over and the bad guys vanquished but again, no explanation of how that occurred. Endless detail about trivial things like equipment, knives, water canisters - but shallow, unbelievable story and characterizations. An ending that just drops dead as if the pen ran out of ink.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I guess its ok . Pretty juvenile humor .  The set up was perfect for me . Fresh pot of coffee . Cold dark rainy day .  Got to lounge in my PJs all day . But even all that couldnt make this movie very good .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watch this on my iPad while I run on the treadmill.  Watching this series makes my workouts more enjoyable.  Sometimes, I exercise a little longer than I had planned,...I can't stop in the middle of a great episode!  :-D
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I own a photo restoration company (The Digital Pen--[...]) and had someone who asked if I scanned and restored slides.  Never having been asked, I assume it couldn't much different than scanning photos.  Wrong.  So I went on the lookout for a solution.  When I ran across this product, I decided to try it.  It works like a charm!  The images it produces (in less than a second, no less) are stunning.  Another huge advantage is that it's powered by USB or an outlet.  No batteries to waste.  Transfer the picutres via USB (which isn't very efficient as the device's onboard member is quite small), or with an SD card--much better.<br /><br />While I haven't tried scanning negatives, I have no doubt it scans those as well as it does slides.  My only complaint with it is that it's sometimes hard to get slides in or out of the device.  I've had to frequently resort to using needle-nose pliers to remove the slides.  But don't let this minor inconvenience deter you from buying the product.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is a great game.  I only wish there were more puzzles available.  If you love puzzles, as I do, this only leaves you wanting more.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles are great.  I've the is set up.  But now twice it freezes up with a black black screen.  I reboot my Kindle, and it is still a black screen with puzzle magic.  I have to take it off of my Kindle and then reload it.
B00006674X|4.0|Actually if I did not like the movie I would not have bought the movie in the first place to own
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Love the walking dead...watched the tv series and just had to get the graphic novels...great start can't wait to read the rest
B001QWBM62|5.0|So many functions and abilities and GREAT quality for the price. It is simply versatile. If you are looking for a simple recorder, The zoom H1 is much quicker and easier to use and still has fantastic quality, but you wont get the professional looking studio recorder quality feel that you do from the Zoom H4N.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It takes about 15 seconds to boot up. (Journalists must be prepared!)
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great! A continuation of a really good series.  A long time fan. Cant wait for season 4. Soon I hope.

B00AQ71FLK|1.0|This game was good for a couple of weeks until there was an update and now I can't even play it just brings to a screen that said update to log in but it doesn't even update I even reinstalled the game and it said update to log in. So watch out for the phantom update.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think the game subway surfer is a great game but the problem is that my mate can not move on from Rome to Sydney
B009VMN3RA|4.0|It's an interesting book at times, but gets tiring after a while.  I had a very similar relationship with my own mother, so I don't doubt that the subject matter is true.  Shirley MacLaine also says that much of the stories in the book are untrue, but again from my own personal experiences, my bet is that she either doesn't remember or is in denial.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Actually if I did not like the movie I would not have bought the movie in the first place to own
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I really enjoy the game. I have friends that play and we compete to get the best park. I have the worst one but I am hopeful I will come back. No need to pay real money, you can get cash over the game by completing missions and leveling up. Friends can also send tourists that will contain cash periodically.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It had vivid detail in this book. Every inch of this book was heart felt.
B006WXW098|3.0|Even with B&K amp + Ascends, you must still crank it up for Gretchen and Gluck which cause unpleasant in listening.  Gretchen is too fast to relate to wheel spinning.  Yuja has good technic but this CD is a let down due to Gretchen and Gluck recording and playing style.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|If you want the blu-ray of the movies, then this a good set.  There was no sign of the the digital copy codes though.  When I contact the seller, they said that I could return it.  It didn't seem worth all the fuss, but it cost them a star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ever since I got this game I've loved it so much it's a great game and I love it so much what roud thing is there to say
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Kept a hyper 10 year old captivated (and quiet) for the duration. Great! Don't have seven more words to write
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very addictive game but it has a glich where when in full sensitivity and tutorial it tresses, you dissapear, and the round starts over. Don't get me wrong, this is the best game if you want a dealt good free game and I say it is a STEAL of a deal. :-)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Even continuing it in my dreams last night. I had to quit reading because I had to go to bed! Very good story and will see the movie with hubby and cry. Love all his work!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi my name is ashanti. I love this game called subway surfers.It goes through all the state's in the world. From New York to Sydney so far. I love this game because it includes helpers like mystery boxes,hoveboards, super sneakers jetpacks and a lot more. This game is fun for teens, children,and even adults. I recommend this game for adults and basically for people who just want to have fun.  you will be able to have fun even when your not in the mood. Subway Surfers is a amazing game I recommend it to everybody. You don't even need to spend money you use the money you earned to get new characters and so much. I love subway surfers. I hope you loved my review. I hoped this gave you some reasons to download subway surfers.Hoped you enjoyed. I hope this was helpful.<br /><br />Bye. Thanks for reading!!!!!!!!!

B004UJAOLM|3.0|It was a weird book, not my favorite of the Bronte sisters but it was an interesting read. It was interesting enough that I would read it again.
B004AKCME8|5.0|Bought for the Grand kids.  They love movies like this.  They have watched it a couple of different times.  They like watching it when ever they have different friends over.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this show, great acting, beautiful home and great storyline. Can't wait for Season 4. PBS has a winner.

B0011Z5IVE|5.0|The only problem with this album was that the radio stations overplayed the crap out of Stairway t Heaven and it soured me on that fabulous song. The rest of the album was really overlooked in comparison. These boys could rock.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie does everything that i could ever want in an movie.<br />Great cinematography, substantive story that will stay with me for years.<br />Such a good movie.  I watched Argo and after seeing Life of Pi i would give it a 2 star and Life of Pi a any number of stars beyond 5.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|It still has his signature stamp on the guitar. I was disappointed it didn't have any rock as it was more bluesy. Its a terrific album though despite the tempered sound. Always loved him.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|I love this movie and have seen it many many times. However, I have issues in the way it would load. If you paused the movie it wouldn't let you start there, you had to start it from the beginning. It took forever to load properly. I know it wasn't my Kindle Fire, because I tried it with different movies. Very annoying!
B00B2064IY|3.0|Stop finding throw aways and marketing them as the lost/found Hendrix tunes. They were probably outtakes and he never wanted them published to begin with. Sorry I was really really disappointed with this mix.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|As I read it, I had a set of circumstances come up that were eerily similar to the situation the book.  It is an excellent and entertaining way to get across some very insightful methods of IT management.
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|This was the one that opened everyone's eyes to this Supergroup. Nothing has changed. Jimmy page still playing a mean guitar with Plant screeching out those vocals. Led Zeppelin still relevant 40+ years later. John Bonham on Drums with John Paul Jones on Bass. The four of them could rock.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game my son loves to play. It is very fun and challenging at the same time. Wonderful graphics too. So much fun
B003VANOFY|4.0|Well..let's make it short n simple, the wifi range of this headphone is awesome,so does the spec that goes with it but i find the earpiece not so comfy other than that is just gooooood.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My 3-year-old was having a great time with the game until it suddenly started glitching like crazy (the culprit is probably this latest update). Now we can only open it if we close and reopen six or seven times, and none of her little friends appear in her friends list, so she isn't able to get any hearts. It's pretty frustrating for her, so we're going to uninstall it and maybe try again a few months down the road. Maybe things will get fixed by then.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I have a 4 year old and a 2.5 year old and I like that both my kids can play this game on their own due to the many levels.  And &#34;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&#34; is one of their favorite books right now so the tie-in is fun.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever love it how its now Sydney and do more Easter egg hunt stuff its fun but there are some bugs

B0085HWZDK|5.0|Incredible concert. Stellar performances and musicianship. Darrell Scott and Buddy Miller are two of the best string players you'll ever hear. Patty Griffin is amazing and what can you say about Robert Plant? They do some Led Zeppein favorites among the songs along with some gospel. this band rocks.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|While I was reading these reviews, primarily the lower rated ones, I noticed a trend.. Either they were insulted by the mental health aspect of it or that it wasn't as good as the book.<br />LISTEN.<br />Movies are NEVER as good as the books. Just get used to that fact.<br /><br />Also, everyone's experience with mental illness is different. Just because this isn't yours, doesn't mean it's wrong. I am bipolar and have multiple family members who are bipolar, and yes, the movie characters were an accurate representation of my personal experience with bipolar to the point where I was laughing with my mother when these characters were acting manic because members of my family have done the same exact thing, like looking for something completely unimportant in the middle of the night and NEEDED it then(the wedding video). (Mania is an diagnosing factor in bipolar disorder)<br /><br />IF you did your research before seeing it- which I did- you would know that these characters were based on truly bipolar people. The director's son is bipolar. If you do not think this is an accurate representation and you are actually bipolar, you need to do some research, my friend. Talk to your psychiatrist. It's actually quite interesting- but I'm majoring in Psychology, though, so I'm a tad biased.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie. There was not a dull moment in it. The characters were well thought out and very well portrayed and acted. (I am singing praise for Jennifer Lawrence and bradley Cooper!) They had the way you talk when you are manic down perfectly, so they obviously did their research. Also, they even had Bradley Cooper's eyes DILATED. Bravo! (For those of you who don't know- the medicine he was taking makes your eyes dilated.)<br /><br />Thank you, cast and crew of Silver Linings Playbook for a stellar movie that I have seen four times and so many more to come. This is now my favorite movie.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Always something new. I always enjoy the show. I have watched it for years and am a big fan. Look forward to more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It turns out this is it! I could download my file onto my kindle fire and edit the crap out of it as if it were a note to self. I created an eleven page AP level newspaper on WWII on my tablet for free. I couldn't have asked for more, but there's more in the app anyways.
B0026145WK|5.0|If you are a die hard Liam Neesom fan as I am you will love this movie! He is such a smooth operator! I watched it twice!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I have been looking for a good racing app for a long time, so I was excited when this came out. I had my doubts... free apps of this magnitude usually have poor graphics and/or controls. But I absolutely love this app!<br />The graphics are great, and you can adjust them depending on what your device can handle. (Great-medium-okay  kind of thing.) The racetrack looks great, and the vehicles were much better looking than I expected.<br />The controls are amazing as well. There are multiple settings for the controls (tilt, buttons, etc.) which is great. All of them work well, and you can adjust the sensitivity. I personally prefer (after experimenting with all of the choices) the tilt controls. I turned the sensitivity down a little (because I tend to get overexcited and spazzy with these kinds of games) and it works great.<br />There's background music while you race, which I found nice- but didn't prefer. So I just turned the music off.<br />The way the game works is you are in control of your racer, and you race as far as you can. You're given a time limit, and there are checkpoints as you race. As you pass these checkpoints, you are given more time. The race becomes increasingly more difficult, with more obstacles and less time.<br />Along the way, you can collect coins. You use these coins to unlock multiple different racers and cars. You can also upgrade you racecar and change the color schemes.<br />I would not recommend this app for kids under the age of 6 or 7, because it takes time to master the controls.<br />The crashing, and racing itself actually seemed very realistic to me. If you hit a rock, your car can overturn and you have to use the reset button (which gets you right back up near to where you crashed, and let's you continue) but you have to be careful because this wastes precious time.<br />Note: This app drained my battery pretty fast, and really heated up my device, but with the quality of the app... it is to be expected. I let this slide in my review because of the great quality, and the fact that it was free.<br />Overall, this app blew me away with the amazing quality of graphics, sounds and controls. I would recommend it to anyone 6+. I would have gladly paid for this app, and am thrilled to finally have a decent racing game.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book hooked me within the first chapter-I loved the way the characters connected and how the story read as a he/she.  Its refreshing to read something that is truely believable and so well developed.  After the crazy twists and turns you find yourself sad that the story is over!<br />Since reading this book-I have purchased her other books available.  Nice to find a &#34;new&#34; author to enjoy!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Temple Run has done it! Broken the monotonous game play and introduced a variety of graphics ranging from Jungle paths to balloon rides on glaciers. Absolutely love it! Would recommend it to everyone having a android device!
044024613X|1.0|I couldn't wait to get this book.  I was so disappointed.  It is terrible.  Don't waste your time or money.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game because it has so much detail; and the good thing about it is free. I hope you buy it and you like it so much you rate it 5 stars like me.
1250010403|5.0|I have read almost all Archers works.  This is a good read that makes you can't wailt for the 3rd installment.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Comprehensive overview of the potentially damaging effects of wheat and gluten.  Tons of technical info.  Informative but challenging to see a path to wheat free in today's food world.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Honestly this is by far the best keyboard I've found and I even got this for free because it was the app of the day a long time ago I would highly recommend it
B0030MM68O|4.0|In some ways a thoughtful portrayal of the stress of combat and war BUT poor representation of Arabs. Too bad the conventions of Hollywood take precedence over truth. Who is actually suffering more? It is not one-sided
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love book two even more than book 1 I just bought book 3 and will be starting it shortly.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|The book had some good suggestions.  But as it says you need to be prepared with open ended sentences.  Also there is a need to practice so it does not sound stiff and/or awkward.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I love movies that are based on true stories!  This is no exception, very good!  I had to look past all of the 70's cars, hair and clothing but it was true to the time :-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This Game is so so so so so so so so so SWEET! Great game: I totally recommend this!also great graphics!
B005U9QVPE|4.0|This movie captivates my children no matter how many times they have seen it. Now on my Kindle Fire HD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Has to be one of the best books I have ever read!!! Loved it!!! Can't wait to read more of Nicholas Sparks books!!! Just Amazing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved playing this game but when I got a lot of gems and coins it froze up and I had to re download it and lost everything I had!!!
B00BM9WM2C|5.0|although bon jovi probably wont win that many new fans with this album due to the political nature of it those of us who love bon jovi and always will will love this cd! its a classic rocking album with plenty of ballads. love it love it love it :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I went back and watched the season 1 again, I think I enjoyed it more the second time, I'm working on season 2 now.  This is such a great show.  Sure glad I have Prime so It doesn't cost me anything to watch it.
B005VTGB0S|4.0|Bought this one for an iPad2. The quality is satisfying, however the bands that hold the device in place do not allow convenient access to some buttons and the headphone jack. Also, it doesn't have a hole for the rear camera, since I don't use the camera that much I don feel the need for it. Overall good product
B002NK2L0M|5.0|Explores the background of the counter intel operations of the CI A before and after WW2. The movie lines pretty accurately with actual history. Great movie for anyone who is familiar with this period of time, Bay of Pigs, Cold War era, etc.
B0088W7VNG|4.0|The series came to a rather abrupt end. Yet, Season 5 was better than Season 4. Either way, for &#34;Stargate&#34; fans, the Atlantis series is worth diving into.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I have only 2 complaints. I wish that I could get the game screen to rotate when I have my kindle in a horizontal or landscape position and I wish there was a way to earn clues. Other than that...I can't put it down. This is the most addictive game I have played. Even my 80 year old mother is hooked and for her it is a great mental exercise that sharpens her critical thinking skills. I LOVE IT!!!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Depeche Mode has done a great job in the past decade carving out a nice little place in pop music that nobody else can quite fill. They've gone from a quirky charm in the 80s with songs like \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" to brooding gothic pop of \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Walking In My Shoes\\", and at their darkest, \\"Barrel Of A Gun\\". Ultra was really a turning point because after nearly overdosing and going through rehab, Dave Gahan came back with a vengeance and seemed to have a whole new energy to his voice. Four albums and a decade and a half later, Delta Machine sounds like a band still staying relevant by avoiding trying to be relevant. These guys aren't teaming up with David Guetta. They don't have to. They helped invented the synthpop that became the best elements of today's electronic dance music.<br />Their latest opens with bass thumps and wubwubs that might make you think you are in for a Skrillex collaboration. But a few seconds in, Gahan's voice reminds you this is the band you love. With lyrics like \\"I'll weep into your eyes\\", this song crawls under your skin. \\"Angel\\" is a strange new feel for the band, straddling between two beats at once and Gahan's tortured singing, sounding his angriest possibly ever. Then it launches into a hard industrial rocker before pulling back to its sparse beginning. \\"Heaven\\" goes for the slow burn. It has a sad melancholy piano driving it, and the backing vocals by presumably Martin Gore are almost haunted gospel. \\"Secret To The End\\" mixes a frenzy of the electronic with guitar and stays in this vibe with the first three songs.<br />\\"My Little Universe\\" starts with a simple electro beat and fizzy keyboard note that reminds me of the intro of an Underworld track. The vocals are gorgeous and the track remains subtle even as elements are added to the mix. \\"Slow\\" is about as close as Depeche comes to a blues song. It rides a fuzzy keyboard, twangy guitar and creeps up on you.<br />\\"Broken\\" has one foot in the past, recalling just a taste of \\"Behind The Wheel\\" albeit slowed down. Yet it isn't a repeat at all. The band continually finds new sounds to put in their mixes that haven't been done yet, so the familiar becomes the future once again. \\"The Child Inside\\" is a chance for Gore to shine with his own vocals. Some of the creepiest lyrics are in this one, with \\"You really should have dug a little deeper there, body parts are starting to appear and scare the child inside away\\".<br />Next is one of my favorites, \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve\\". This goes for electronic thump but has a great set of lyrics. It also never kicks in with a true dance-pop beat, which draws you into the lyrics even more. \\"Should Be Higher\\" comes next and is another standout. It has a swashbuckling groove and feels like it could have been from the Violator period. There's also some high notes in this one that are a rarity.  \\"Alone\\" has a rolling beat, strings, and a wave of synth drums that underscore Gahan's sad yearning vocals.<br />\\"Soothe My Soul\\" follows next. This one has more than just a hint of \\"Personal Jesus\\" and its various remixes at its rhythmic core, yet the verses are similar to \\"I Feel You\\". yet the song has a different life than either of those two. This is the new single and is sure to be the featured song if one of these makes it mainstream. The sexy swaggering grind of the beat makes it irresistible. No band does this sound better than Depeche Mode. The final song of the set, aptly titled \\"Goodbye\\", has a folky bluesy guitar up against a synth beat, that gives way to an industrial pounding drum off in the distance. The thing this band amazes me with is that Gore writes great lines like \\"I was always looking, looking for someone. Someone to stick my hook in, or pull it out and run\\". And then David Gahan sings them with such personal conviction that you would never question to find out that Gore is the writer and not Gahan.<br />The deluxe edition comes in a very nicely done book style package with photos and lyrics, and the addition of four bonus songs. These are placed on a separate disc, I suppose to assure you that they are not part of the actual album. While they remain in the same vibe, these tracks let the band try a few tricks that step just outside the box of the album. \\"Long Time Lie\\" has a quiet creeping melody, and Gore's backing vocals sound again like creepy gospel. I am not sure if age is giving his voice this added effect, but I like it. \\"Happens All the Time\\" has an electro dubsteppy bassline that reminds me of Muse's \\"Follow Me\\" in how it rolls. This is a delicate but detailed track. It doesn't have a big catchy melody, but the subtle little touches make this track a really good one. \\"Always\\" is an ear-grabber with all of the clever effects and sounds that make up its backdrop. The song has a slow churn but each turn gives some subtle surprise. Lastly, \\"All That's Mine\\" brings things back upbeat but still keeps things subdued. Of note here is that the lyrics to three of the four bonus tracks are my David Gahan and co-writer Kurt Uenala. It makes me wonder if Gahan holds his songs back due to lack of confidence, or if the band unanimously liked the others better. Granted \\"Should Be Higher\\" and \\"Secret To the End\\" are by Gahan and Uenala also. I definitely recommend the deluxe version, as the bonus tracks are every bit as good as other tracks on the album. These aren't throwaways and should be enjoyed as part of the overall album experience.<br />So the bottom line, this album feels a bit darker than Sounds of the Universe, but feels like a natural continuing of the type of dark synth pop the band has been creating for a while. There's no left turns into full on dance music. This is music for adults who were children or teens of the late 80s who still need beautiful brooding music for darker days.nd the addition of four bonus songs.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a fun game can't wait for the next chapter!!  Wish it was a longer game and more drama.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Since my husband and I missed the original shows on PBS, we purchased the limited edition set so we can view at our leisure.  However, we are finding 'leisure' time very often which allows us to watch this marvelous show.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Good God - it's a man's heart laid bare to the world. Amidst a barrage of plastic pop - this album is musical poetry about a segment of one man's human experience.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I enjoyed the combination of scholarly research and personal observation and anecdotes.  As a person starting a new business who lacks a formal sales background I thought the book did a good of providing substance And real-world applicability To the art and science of selling.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is going to be in a position to influence customers.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Fun Game!! A reminder of the old Mario Games that we all loved so much.  I find it a bit hard to maneuver on the Kindle, but otherwise if you're looking for an old time game, it's worth getting.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|This is a fabulous little movie. The product was in good condition. Hope to enjoy it for years to come.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful ! You can read any version of the bible you like. The daily lesson plans help you to learn and don't take a long time to do.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was really looking forward to this film. While it has a few funny scenes that really hit the mark, overall the story went absolutely nowhere. It's really more of a series of vignettes very loosely strung together. Almost worth watching though for the accurate portrayal of the teen daughter, and the scenes with Melissa McCarthy. If you hang in there with the movie, make sure to watch the blooper scene at the end with Melissa's rant in the principal's office.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This movie is a cult classic and I am very pleased with my purchase! As soon as it arrived I immediately watched and enjoyed Little Shop of Horrors. Steve Martin is hilarious as a sadistic dentist and I recommend this movie to all lovers of the macabre.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This movie has still &#34;got it&#34;. It's cute, smart, funny, and has a great musical score. Beautiful graphics and great acting.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|It is a really good show that tells the story very well. It is very well made and you really get into the story and feel for the characters. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy.
B003QSJDZQ|4.0|Our family rewatched this movie and it was still funny and enjoyable. Even my 15 year old was laughing hysterically.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|It's a well executed film but I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a film designed for children. The effects wound up taking precedence over the story and there are a great number of predictable plot twists. I did enjoy it however but LOTR is simply too hard of an act to follow.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the best game ever I hope that they will leave this game on the app store cause I really like this game
B00AB55BS0|5.0|great show, my husband got me into it. have to watch season 2 now.. we dont get HBO on our TV so i have to wait til season 3 comes out..
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The ease of the game and the challenges are great.  Wish it wouldn't use up so much power.  Only drawback is that you can't save the game your on at any given time.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|After creating a beautiful world filled with so much life and authenticity, the writer opens his Downton Abbey season three with cheap contrivance and ends with a pathetic and desperate ploy to find some way to stretch this series to another season. I always say \\"if you have to stoop to cheap tricks to finish a script, it won't be worth much. That's how I feel about season 3. I adored this series. I have never been so utterly in love with a tv series before - even a Masterpiece Theater series.<br /><br />I don't know what the writer was thinking. After you load so much sickness, pain, morbid heartbreak and brutal, untimely death into a script, after awhile it gets laughable. I will not watch this program in the future. You know it's ok for people to be happy - even the aristocracy. I mean, they're people, too.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A very easy read, but still increasing. A great underlying message about the conflict and control in society. Would recommend.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|For SciFi nuts like me, this is a great series.  Parallel universes are now talked about in string theory.  With this series you can imagine how two of these parallel universes may interact with each other.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Couldn't put it down .....Not so sure I liked the ending though.... I guess there are two more books until I reach the real ending.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|By far, my favorite Amazon game!  I am totally addicted to it...morning, noon and night!  Not all that difficult, but challenging enough so that you never get bored with it.  Somebody take it away from me so I can get something done!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You really need to get this game because it's really addicting and everybody that I know has it I would give this game 5,000,000,000,000,000 stars if I could!
B0043XS7IC|5.0|A jammin blend of funk, blues and southern rock. This  underrated, riff-driven band is a welcomed alternative to much of the self-loathing pop rock on radio today.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|4 star book...enjoyed the first two..ready to read book 3! Characters are somewhat predictable, but still an enjoyable series to read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Shows how love can pull you through anything. Demonstrates how even when your life is rough there will always be a happy ending as long as you cherish the things you love.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|This show has it all.  It interleaves Norse mythology into a great story of adventure and discovery, culture clash, religious comparison, technology and craftsmanship in balance.  It isn't fantasy and it isn't history, though its both fantastical and historical.  The story has the epic feel of the world on the cusp of change while the obstacles are personal, and make the world feel very small. I'm looking forward to more of it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It took me no more than a few days to tear through to title the first time. The trilogy in its entirety is incredible, but this final piece truly stands as the only possibly ending to this amazing epic. True to her established style, Collins relents a torrent of creativity and grandure as she pens the final episodes of the Mockingjay's life. In great detail and vivid portrayal, Katniss Everdeen lives out her romance, her anxiety, her nightmares, and her revenge as an ever-constant stream of guilt and regret tears itself through her mind. Collins never fails to let us into the mind of Katniss and takes the reader on an adventure that will leave one riveted. Mockingjay is truly the most perfect ending to an epic that will live on as one of the best novels of the decade and our generation.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series. It is beautifully filmed, well acted and layered with interconnected stories. Sadly but appropriately, it also contains the highs, lows and random events of life.

B0001MLMKY|5.0|This is a very affordable day to day watch.<br />Nice design and I can use it everywhere without being scared to damage it. also for gardening.
7883701606|5.0|As an American who fully understands Chinese, I deeply enjoy watching this film because I know the lines from memory, so any unclear words in the translation become easier to learn.  Bravo!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  Each week I look forward to the new episode, kinda like reading a good book in a series that you can't put down.  Well done!

B00947N6UG|5.0|Great movie!  Even I enjoyed it!  It's on rotation with the other favorite my son has!  5 stars for sure!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Bought and played this game with the family, which involved my kid sister, parents (who are in their 50s) and grandparents (in their 70s). They all LOVED this game. It was easy to learn, very imaginative and my grandma enjoyed crushing us all.<br /><br />On another note, I'm an artist, myself, and I can't get over how gorgeous all the cards are. Great art and good times!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Its  just, well,  terrible. Im going to put it again, so I can get the 20 words.  T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E<br />boring.  It seems  that a very good editor wrote the  first  pages and then, well, she wrote the rest.  Do not buy this book. Read it  from a library  if  you can.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|So nice to have a calculator right on your phone or Kindle Fire. I am not good at math so this is a life saviour for me.
B000002GYR|4.0|I'm not a Tom Waits fan but I do enjoy some of his material thats romantic and meloncholy.  This is a good CD with good material.  My favorite is the sound track from Coppola's film
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Well this movie was a real letdown. It looked great but it was incredibly boring to watch. I expected so much more from the director and the huge compliment of actors.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This movie really makes you wonder how many layers of a dream can there possibly be.  Easily amongst my favorites and one I can watch over and over without getting bored knowing what's going to happen.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just a calculator, exactly what I wanted and needed. Easy to use and works exactly like it is suppose to. No problems here.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters are alive and so intertwined that the family that they are becomes the focal point of investing love.
0375507256|4.0|Haven't finished this book yet. I saw the movie, really liked it. I really wanted the author/ David Mitchell's quotations that are interspersed throughout the movie. Philosophy wise they're excellent.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time . Very boring  , can not believe Denzel was in this. Do yourself a favor and skip this one !
B008X6N1OA|4.0|I swear, each time I watch these movies, I'm mostly entertained by the squirrel.  This movie is pretty good, and the squirrel has much more screen time (to my delight).  The rest of the characters return as well in their own story, getting separated from their family and trying to get back to them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game espeaially now that there on tour.also its kinds funny how I have way way way way higherscore than my freinds
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I saw the movie Lincoln and first realized how little I knew about his bio and development.  Doris Kearns Goodwin brought his life and era to life.  An extraordinary read.  It was slow going since I read for relaxation purposes and limit my allotted time to lunch hours; and before bed, however, I can honestly say it was one of my most enjoyable months of reading.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this is by far one of the best games i've ever played and it definatly tthe best out of all the shark things
B0034DGPEU|4.0|After visiting plantations in New Orleans, this was a great book to continue with an insight of American history. Having seen living quarters and Creole and America plantations, imagination ran wild.<br /><br />Twists and turns in the plot were well executed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered Firefly after watching Castle, and discovering Nathan Fillion was one of the lead actors. I am so glad I did. It may have only run for one season, but it has imprinted itself on the hearts of millions. Part western, part futuristic space exploration, and all about the good guys versus the bad guys, Firefly has something for everyone. There are 9 very diverse characters, all with very different backgrounds. What binds them together is the need for freedom, which they find on Serenity, the ship they live and travel in together. Whether you have seen Firefly a hundred times, or not at all, you should pick up this series. You won't be disappointed.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|great price,  i bought it for a gift . i was able to track the shipment and came in when it was expected.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a brilliant woman who serves as an excellent role model for girls to look up to. She is a modern day Susan B Anthony, and the working world for women wouldn't be the same without her. Her quick wit keeps you wanting to read more. I thoroughly enjoyed the fact she uses profanity and doesn't try to pretend to be a little tart that can only handle half a piece of gum at a time. Thank you Tina for your ever expanding talent of entertainment.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I am not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this novel has really caught my attention and held it.  It is quite long, but I find myself staying up late reading for hours.  At times it has been on the verge of being offensive to my religious values.  I am Protestant, not Catholic, and I imagined the Protestant main character would share my values, but the main character's morality is difficult to clearly label.  I suppose that is part of what has kept me interested.  If I was disgusted with him, I might stop reading.  I am always impressed with any novel that has more than 10 words in it that I have never seen before, and this one has helped to amplify my vocabulary.  The action is so intriguing that I find I have to restrain myself from skipping whole sentences looking for how the chapter concludes.  I like how Clavell ends each chapter in suspense.  I suppose that is what keeps me up late as I continue to read.  With other books, the end of a chapter is usually a good stopping point.  With this book, I am always anxious to continue reading.  I also like that it gives a glimpse of ancient Japanese culture and is infused with some Japanese language.  Overall, I am very impressed.  The book is well written and is entertaining to read.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I have had to uninstall this game 2 x now and now I have to do it again cause it will start up until about ready to play and goes back to shutting off. getting really mad. I have it on my Kindle Fire. Anyone else doesn't have this problem. Ready to call amazon about it. I will tomorrow.
1592403913|5.0|This is a great book as a primer for college or anyone who would like to better their writing skills.  I have a new appreciation for semicolons.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games &amp; this one is the best out there.  I just wish energy for each room wasn't so much - I'd kill more of my time playing - haha!!
0345529057|5.0|Had gotten boyfriend first edition hardbacks that he refuses to open or crease in any way. This was the better deal including those from bargain book stores!!
B008ODZUN2|2.0|Had trouble staying awake.  It's a ho Hum movie that has a boring dialogue.  I wouldn't recommend it to friends.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Looked for last minute gift add on for boyfriend. Stores were sold out and this was the best deal even including sale prices at local stores!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|also gives estimates on approximate time remaining for each use. custom colors are a nice option too. you cant go wrong with a price of free.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7 year old son has gone from a Lego obsession to addicted to Minecraft.  Some type of in game tutorial that would be helpful but we could not find one.  All that aside my son had no problem figuring out how to build and has probably had more fun discovering new things in the game everday.  Great game for imagination and mind &#34;building&#34;
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series! it is one of the best series I have seen and the first british series I have ever watched. Looking forward to season 4 as I am almost thru season 3 !
B004H6G0TI|5.0|really fun game. It falls between 4 and 5 stars but I decided yo give 5 stars to encourage further development. MiniSquadron brings the old classic airplane shoot-them-up feel. Great entertainment when you have several minutes to burn. The design of the planes could be a bit less looney. I could see more potential with different type of weapons for the airplanes.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show, loved the leads, the custumes and great story lines.  I particularly like the lead actrist her expressios and eyes tell it all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We started watching this because all our friends are watching it!  This show keeps both me and my husband interested and I love the story line.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Waiting patiently for the next one. Hurry I don't know how long patience can last. Don't know how long u can go on, but hope it's long enough for a since of finishing can exist!
B00B47NO2O|1.0|I was excited to start watching this new Kevin Bacon show. The topic seemed to be up my alley.<br />Couldn't even make it through 1 episode. Too violent in an unnecessary way. I am shocked that was even allowed on Fox. Just a few years ago The X-Files was the most risque thing on that channel. I would take their black ooze any day over this. This was a level violence that you can only enjoy if perhaps you like watching movies with torture scenes.<br /><br />So, first episode, the main character is so unhappy, he is drinking all day. I probably would be pretty unhappy too, if I had to look at tortured dogs, and see a woman strip down and stab herself through the eye into her brain - only on the first episode, people! So, we decided to turn the TV off.<br /><br />Later on, out of boredom we tried to watch part of an episode where the woman Kevin Bacon saved a while back, suddenly gets murdered because her gay neighbors are members of this murderous cult. Riiight. So, we will not even watch it out of boredom anymore. A show where there are murderous cult followers is just going to go on forever, and it has been done before. Have you heard of The Mentalist? Except The Mentalist often lends a comedic balance to the gore and sad situations. The Mentalist keeps going on season after season because everyone is a secret member of Red John's cult. So, I feel like The Following was a sorry, dark rip off of The Mentalist, which is a show I actually like. I am surprised The Following has been renewed. I hope to see Kevin Bacon in some better shows or movies more worthy of his calibur in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant game gives you hours of enjoyment though would be better if crossed different countries during the game. Characters rather expensive and no bonus offers apart from that addictive and definitely worth a game
B009WO7NQO|3.0|the game was fun but when I updated it erased all my progress I think a good game shouldn't do that I hope you agree.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|whenever I got the I got addicted I play all the time when I get bored and I love how it goes to different places and the limited time characters are really cool :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so so much fun i cant stop playing the game  happy happy i dont know why i typing this
B005EGXSWW|3.0|The plot was strange,convoluted and at times totally dense.<br />Too much philosophizing without much philosophical substance . The book would have been better if it had half the pages
B009S33I68|5.0|Moore and Galloway tell it the way it was.  Breaks your heart to hear the stories of the dead and injured but we often forget that we we had over 58,000 killed in Vietnam.  This is the story of some of them and really helps to understand the courage and selfless service of so many young Americans in a war that they didn't really understand.
B007N6NGYG|1.0|Never could figure this one out.  Took it off my Kindle but I did not like it at all...not user friendly
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game reminds me of the golden age of video games, the 80's!<br />Back when you didn't need a college degree or the need to study a football<br />play book just to play a game!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like this game.  It's fast paced and will keep you occupied for a long time..Very entertaining, good graphics, it's a keeper.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I tried to use Evernote for a to do list but it was too complicated. This fit the bill perfectly. The screen shots show the whole deal.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book, read it in 2-3 days. good characters, kept you intrigued, and interested throughout.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler's first double album and it's all good! Not sure why it's an import but I don't really care as the music was some of his best yet.
B005JZBPHS|1.0|Today is 03/04/2013 and nothing opens . lost? open it sent?<br />I hope some news, because it is the first time that fails ................. a purchase
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good hidden object game for a decent price. could be more levels but overall a good way to pass time
B003JTHXOK|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if the book would keep my attention but I could not put it down. I stayed up reading this book late every night. The only reason I stopped reading at night was because I fell asleep. Very addicting.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I have read a lot about Lincoln and was so excited to see this movie. There was so much more to Lincoln's life than this absolutely boring part that was highlighted in the movie. Don't bother watching it unless you are a history buff. I am a \\"Lincoln buff\\" and found this disappointing.
1452110581|5.0|This is a very funny book. I can see my cats in some of these poems.  Good coffee table book.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|very very good read - a little slow at first but could not put it down by the time i was one chapter in.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this app, but it won't update. sorry but I have to give it some negative points. Hope none of you guys have the same problem.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|A great thriller that I couldn't put down,  I read it in record time!  I highly recommend you read this book.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I personally think Glee is a great show.  I love singing and music and have for most of my life.  This show takes me back to my own experiences being in the chorus in grade school.  How much I loved the music and learning the words to the songs.  That is what initally drew me into Glee.  We didn't have the massive bullying that is seen in the show for being in our school's chorus.  Great show.  Love it and still watching it.
B0015AARJI|2.0|When i received my controller it was in great condition and came on time. The only problem i encountered was that whenever i tried to use this controller it would take a few seconds for the PlayStation to respond to the controller, meaning that when you pushed the thumb stick up or even pushed any of the buttons, it would take a few seconds for the console to start that action. I know it is not my PlayStation because i have 3 other controllers that all work fine. I would recommend just buying a real PlayStation controller sold by Sony Entertainment and saving yourself the trouble.
B00ABO573A|5.0|This is beyond doubt, for me anyway, one of the finest gay-themed films ever made. It will rip your heart out. It is the story of the decline of a lovely young man, victimized by crack cocaine addiction, and its horrendous effect on the loving, caring relationship with his partner. The screenplay, acting, direction, and attention to detail are remarkable. This film could easily serve as a cautionary tale when shown in LGTB centers and drug rehabs. This is a must-see!
1616550414|5.0|My daughter wanted this book for a gift. We preordered it and it proved very well worth her wait. It is a complete history to present  of the games.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Always good to watch. Such a good story and a new classic. Always watch when I need a good cry.
B000KIRT6A|3.0|This unit seems quiet and useful for a volume boost and that is all we really needed.  So itwill work fine for us.  I was really disappointed however that the eq does not work interdependently. Kicking the unit on and off also turns the eq on and off.  For the life of me I just do not understand any application for that.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You get to watch as Christian opens up more, and he falls deeper and deeper in love. This book was great and I love the whole series.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Even with it's flaws,i love this show. It needed more time to flesh out the characters but alas it was not to be.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I truly hope that they make this into a Movie. You just fall in love with Travis and Aby.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Lots of twists and turns so far with this season.  The two episodes about Castles daughter being kidnapped was just filled with surprises.  I just love this whole season!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing ending to this series. To watch as it all unfolds and you see the never ending love continue. Great Series!!
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|I have been waiting to find this movie for YEARS!!!! Now I have it and I cant watch it because it says the origin is unreadable. Which means that I cannot watch it in the USA or on any products sold in the USA. I have to get a German or otherwise international device to watch it on....So no sorry, I am not a happy camper at all!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What more can a girl want?? You become addicted to the book, can't put it down and want to read it over and over again!!
B00999DFP0|5.0|We've watched these seasons several times now and are definitely happy to have the discs. Loved the discount for buying as a bundle.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|one of the worst movie I have seen in a while.  Poor acting and very boring plot.  Geared towards teenagers not for adults.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|God I love this show. The commentary and other extras definitely made this worth purchasing. The first set I received had a defective first disc, but Amazon was great about about replacing it with a new set which has no problems.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have a pre-installed free version that won't update to the full version, and now a full version that I can't play because you can't delete things that came pre-installed. So I paid .99 cents for an app I can't play. What a joke! Thanks Amazon for telling me that I can't have the app installed twice after I already bought it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent collection. I wish the original three movies didn't have the new effects and changes but those are nearly impossible to find and are stupidly expensive when you can. Over all we're very happy with it and the cast/crew commentary is worth listening to.
B001R4MEUM|4.0|I am a long time fan of Genesis back to 1973 and never heard this CD in it's entirity until now. The first CD is great. I understand that Peter Gabriel kept writing lyrics and asked for more music. If this would have been cut down to one CD, it would been great. The second CD seems to be mostly filler. I am a fan of all all era of Genesis.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just download it and enjoy.  What is there to complain about no costs, no ads, and no gimmicks.<br /><br />Great product!
B009AMANBA|1.0|I love studying history, so I was really looking forward to this.  I'd seen an interview with the writer of the book, so I was prepared for her disposition of trying to make Lincoln out to be a Joker; but I'd hoped that she'd bring MORE to the table than that!  She might as well have simply listed the names of the people in Congress who voted &#34;yeah&#34; vs. &#34;nay&#34; on the 13th amendment and titled the movie &#34;The 13th Amendment.&#34;  She missed the many great stories of the times then--from the horror of the war itself to the fact that it was Lincoln's mission to create a Greenback Currency to take away the PRIVATE control over PUBLIC money that got him assassinated by a European Banker's hit man!  Also, if she was aiming to focus on Lincoln's PERSONALITY, she REALLY should've included the fact that he was a regular cannabis user, as that no doubt was key to his profound sense of diplomacy!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I stayed up way too late reading this book.  Heaven help us if Washington is truly this inept.  Plot is  very good.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really like this book.  Another book I could not put down.  Sometimes I wondered about how the book kept going back to a conversation that did not seem to fit with the story but it all came to gather at the end and still left the reader with a decision to make.
B00BVYJG18|5.0|I have been following this band since the beginning so I doubt people writing those reviews never heard 40% of there older stuff. KSE is possibly one of the few bands who stand out in the genre of rock. This CD I think is nothing short of amazing. If this CD is a taste of things to come then bravo. I saw some of the reviews some of the negative ones I had to smile at. People said the same s*** when Howard Jones came aboard. But he was amazing as well. Now that he left people are saying the same stuff. Listen to there first CD and then listen to this. Perfection as never been better! Good job guys.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love Revenge! And the series is great too!! I don't recommend it to people who are critical of over the top dramatic acting.. My husband rolled his eyes more than once. But it's great mindless entertainment. I can't wait for Sunday to see the next episode!! If you missed it on TV and want to catch up... Buy this!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|This is now my favorite show of all time, and yes, I do watch G. O. T.<br /><br />I would find myself thinking about each new episode days after I watched.  I wish I could unwatch it so I could watch it all again for the first time.
B000W99IK2|5.0|This is Schubert at his best! If you are a classical music enthusiast, then this is an album that I would highly recommend for you. I purchased this music for my dad and he simply loves it. The music sound is high quality and crystal clear. The product met all of my dad's expectations, so I am happy. I listened to it while visiting him because he plays it all the time! The quality of sound was very good.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|bought this to split my pc video output so i could run it to both my tv and my projector.  works fine.
B006O6F932|3.0|My girls love this schoolhouse. Very cute and colorful. I wish they would come out with more fun accessories for the Monster High dolls.
B004GYY714|5.0|I recommend paying the .99 cents and getting the update to record and play later. Great for long car rides and screaming children.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game to play to pass the time. Nice graphics and choices for playing. Great app for those whole like android games on their tablet.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a great game but I wish it was easier to get investing pionts. also not every body use facebook
B006T5C5PS|5.0|It's a must read if your planning on becoming a more healthier you. My husband and I started out juicing and this book has taken us to the next journey for becoming healthier happier people.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|Excellent movie with superb acting! Matt Damon's timing was perfect. I was held in suspense throughout and actually hoped that the villain would come out ahead!
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|This game was a good attempt at action game but for some reason either the controls were just off or my expectations were to high. I will say still a fun game. Pretty challenging as well. Check out \\"Project 83113\\" (google search) kinda of the same but better controls.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love this. It is something totally unexpected and wonderful. The hip hop community needs some new voices and this one is both serious and playful.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Ok this game is a copy of YAHTZEE but online against other players it is the best dice game of it's kind.<br /><br />I have set up in tribute to it the only league/tournament/contest of it's kind which can be for anyone with an ipad/droid/on a pc so everybody.<br /><br />google dice with buddies league and sign up to the my free fun league which you play whilst you play the game as normal<br /><br />Spread the word. In the words of TORI AMOS it's gonna be big
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan and Sarah are great and this new album does not disappoint. The first single is great but not the only song worth buying the CD for.
0786891416|2.0|I thoroughly enjoy the wit and humor of the TV series, and find that they strike a good balance with the seriousness of capturing the bad-guy.<br /><br />Consider what we \\"know\\" of Castle (i.e., as defined in the TV series). He researches _everything_. He is picky about _everything_.<br />For example, not just any dress will do for Kate at the charity ball. Do NOT misuse the words IRONY, nor WHO/WHOM. Punctuation (your vs. you're) needs to be _right_. He talks about tightly written sentences, and proper flow.<br /><br />And the pages I read from these books are none of those things.<br /><br />Indeed, I would consider what I read to be barely a first draft. They need another pass to tighten them up, and a pass after that by my fifth grade English teacher to catch the last goofs of punctuation/spelling/whatever.<br /><br />All that said, they are a fun read. With just a bit more effort, they could be much more strongly written (more like I would expect from the Castle character).
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It never works, whether using the full version or the mobile version, don't waste your time.  I was excited to be able to use the full version as I typically only access via the mobile version on my phone but now it's back to just mobile.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not like the ending at all, would not recommend it to anyone of my social friends.  Sorry I read it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun little app. Let's little ones get an idea of what it takes to care for a real horse. The custom options take a long time to earn, but with patience you can really have fun with this game...a must have for house lovers.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I love Cirque du Soleil and I have all of their DVD's I can obtain. Worlds Away is just simply Cirque at its very finest. The costumes are magnificent, the directing is top notch and the acts are simply beyond belief. This is certainly the one Cique du Soleil you nust not miss.
B005DJ7U5G|5.0|Very good copy of the movie. It did not skip and the case was in really good shape. Movie was shipped and received quickly.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|If there is one thing I can point out abiut Tim is ,,, he thinks outside the box.  I am only half way through I am amazed at Tim's ability to make me rethink everything.  In thinking about Tim's book I can almost hear him saying one of my quotes....<br /><br />&#34;Box, box, There's a box? No on told me.&#34; Timothy Michael Ricke
0061765236|5.0|Ive read other books by her but this one had me riveted.  I read it in a day barely stopping to eat.  And on Kindle you can get it for $2 and change!!
0345495004|5.0|The life of Frank Lloyd Wright seems to be captured at a time in our history that seems so normal today.  I found it difficult to believe that this book is fiction.  It is so well scripted. More, more!<br /><br />Timothy Michael Ricke
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This is the last book of the series and liked it the least, just don't like who she ended up with and it just seemed depressing.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is a fun app to play but there are a few things I would change about it.  Doesn't work great on Android phones and the cost of things you are required to buy in the game should be less but overall great game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This being the first book of the trilogy was very good. My first book by this author.  I also enjoyed the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This was one of the best things I've ever spent my time and money on this game is so much fun I love it and I suggest it to many people it's amazing;)
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is the second book of the trilogy and my favorite of the three.  I can't wait for the movie.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I realy like the characters in this show, I have always liked Sherlock Holmes and this update version is no exception.  Well done!!!!
B006MQRLSA|4.0|This is a really good movie, entertaining and Brad Pitt is an added bonus.  I believe its based on a true story.  I highly recommend.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I thought that this was going to be more about Lincoln.  Instead it was about the controversy surrounding the 13th amendment.  I'm not a big Civil War buff, so i did not know who many of the characters were supposed to be.  My husband liked the movie and wants to watch it again (because he fell asleep too) so that is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  Sally Field did a good job!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I am not one for musicals but I really enjoyed this movie.  I loved the music and Julianne Hough.  They could have casted a cuter guy and Tom Cruise does ok.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|I rented this at my husbands request and figured I would just knit the night we watched it.  What a surprise!  A very good movie with an unexpected ending!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This is an almost 3 hour movie.  I didn't like it as well as the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is another must read. It's written beautifully! The Heroes of Olympus series is another intriguing, exciting, and action packed series that you have to read. The Mrak of Athena was my favorite books in the Heroes of Olympus series and I think if you read it, it will be your favorite too!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This movie is ok, not great and worth renting. I wouldn't have wanted to have paid money at the theatre to see it.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|This app, well there's not much you can say about a calculator. Also, Hrh he'd jdjd iris idkd skid N'djamena. jrjdn
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|This is a super cute movie and a surprise at the end.  I enjoyed all the actors and it was very entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|been sending emails for a month. in the beginning they replied but werent crediting owed gems (purchased btw) they wont fix the problem and are now ignoring me! dont pay any money into this app.
B0086DBE62|4.0|This is a really cute movie and good entertainment for the whole family.  Julia Roberts is great in it. I highly recommend.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter has played this game for an hour at a time with all of her attention on it, wanting to show us everything she is doing on the game.  She is 5 and this is the first game that she has reacted this way towards.  She loves it!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Its a decent movie and watched it because I love anything with Bruce Willis in it. Action type futuristic movie.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What can I say, amazing movies and these are the best they ever looked. I am in love with this set and have watched it at least 5 times since release.<br /><br />I have no idea why people are giving this only 1 star, stupids.<br /><br />If you are on the fence, just get it. You'll enjoy the movies and they look great!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Good movie for the older crowd, Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep are some of the greatest actors you can see in a movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i take care of my mother who is in a wheel chair so i have to know what the weather is going to be and i can always count on this app for accurate weather forecasts
B005MMY9A8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and the actors that played in it.  I highly recommend renting it.  Good action flick.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick easy game. No time limits which is good. Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose but you always have fun.
B003THHIEM|4.0|Castle, the author is borderline silly. Some of his antics are endearing (Like laser tag and rapier at home with his daughter) and some go over the line...not in a good way. But the rest of the cast, his detective and her men, his Mom and daughter, , and even the plots and author references make up for it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the lights, the sparkle, the sounds, Feels as if i am at Atlantic City but not loosing any money.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Show. It is so much more than gore and goo. There is an actual story and charactor development. Even if you do not like horror, you will love the story.
1442359315|5.0|did find some parts rather boring (wasn't interested in his illness that much) but his accounts of his journey were incredble
B0063GORYU|5.0|I use this app most often.  I regularly play this game and I always enjoy it.  This app. is crucial to my Kindle.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Pleasantly surprised with this CD. You will not be disappointed with this one.  Certainly not a new name but a badass collection of \\"new\\" material.
0738212415|5.0|cant go wrong with this book. such a great hobbie and defently a stress ralease. even my husban ask me how the lesson are doing!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|In the late 60's and early 70's, as a kid, I always went to Main Music, on Main Street in Springfield Massachusetts. Records, incense, rolling papers. And - bootlegs.<br /><br />It was there I found a bootleg record album of James Taylor and Joni Mitchell singing an acoustic concert together. Simple title, no names: 'Lovebirds.' Heaven. Still have it.<br /><br />So one day I see this silver album cover, with no writing or printing on it, in a record rack labeled 'New Beatles Bootleg.' And it was this. Let it Be, which we now call Naked.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />It sounded like the Beatles were sitting in my room, playing just for me.<br /><br />And I played it a thousand times. Like many of us when the Beatles were still pumping out brand new albums, I practically memorized every note.<br /><br />Eventually the 'real album' came out and I never listened to it. Good thing. Because later, when the CD era came, I heard it and it was all wrong. Horns on 'Let it Be?' And everywhere there were big, fat, ugly arrangements - choruses and heavy drums on 'The Long and Winding Road,' and Yoko harmonizing on 'Across the Universe.' So wrong! Such a lovely, lonely, sad song - it needed John singing all alone.<br /><br />It was not the album I loved. But it was all I could do in the digital era...the original that I fell in love with was long gone.<br /><br />Until now. THIS is IT. The album I heard as a 14-year-old.<br /><br />Pure beauty. Pure talent. This album will remind you vividly that the Beatles were amazing musicians, singers and songwriters. Sure, they had marketing genius, and sure, they changed the world. But this album leaves no doubt. When they sat down together to play, they were amazing.<br /><br />Even if it was in the room of 14-year old boy in the late '60's.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Everything I thought it'd be, so it was an wise choice to buy. I'm glad I bought it, awesome job!
B0032KPE0G|3.0|It is very light hearted and easy movie...quite similar to other movies featuring Hugh Grant but lacks sophistication.<br />If you are Hugh Grant's fan, then it is a great movie to watch him in his 20s..
1401937519|5.0|This is a wonderfully written account of Anita Moorjani's Near Death Experience, NDE.  It describes Anita, her childhood, her fears, her illness and her quick time in another realm when she was dying in the hospital.<br /><br />If there is a book to read to help us understand how to just enjoy, be, love, laugh, live, then this book is it!  There is so much out there that is negative.  This is not.  Let us embrace the positive.  Let us embrace ourselves.<br /><br />It is such a moving account of Anita's experience that I will take this with me for the rest of my days and be mindful to try to live my life fearlessly, to love myself more, to see that we all our wonderful, to understand that we are enlightened just by being!<br /><br />Great easy READ.  Recommend to all your friends.  I've even read parts to my children and they like it.  Smart kids, lol!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Certainly gives you something to think about. Well written and kept my attention, I didn't want to set it down. Our world could certainly come to this if we don't pay attention. I  would recommend it to anyone who loves to read and think.<br /> I am 80 years old and my teen age grandkids enjoyed it as much as I did.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|By the living God, what a film. The penetration, the breadth, the myths and the mayhem, what a piece of work. Like so many works, it depends on what you bring to it. This is Sisyphus, Ulysses, Adam and Coyote. It is a film for those who love film. This is as much of a 'must see' as Citizen Kane. This is an important work.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|A great game all around; from tidy animations, colorful graphics and unique stages; to interesting challenges, a simple 'level up' system and customization options. Provided you have nothing against a shark eating everything that moves, (including the occasional tourist!) This game is a satisfying and fun new addiction for any tablet/smartphone gamer!
B0002TJGQS|4.0|Received on time and performed as advertised.  Great product at a great value. I definitely would purchase from this dealer in the future.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I wish I had read these before watching the series in television.  Good read.  Gets right to the meat of things.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very fun app for kids and adults has lots of activities and my kids love it. Get this app and try it for your self
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this has been a fun game to play with my kids we all enjoy the ice age films and its a nice way to pass some time
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love it. It is good for everyone.<br />Relaxing to play Just wish I had bought the<br />fire larger screen
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Go to log into game n says must install new version.. but gives no options.. n just comes back to original app.. thought was a decent game.. sides the drop servers prob.. till now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun for all ages. I'm giving it a 5. The only con is an ad that pops when you go to the home section. The game has some repetitive scenes but the speed eventually gets so fast that it doesn't matter.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app you get to run from the guard and have different characters and power ups and boards
B005HSG3U6|5.0|very simple case, but very effective. rugged construction.  the black one better than the white one that i got i'm sure. gets dirty really fast. perfect fit. no issues. excellent product.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Recommended !! It is awesome!!! If you like to read adventurous books,then read this awesome book !!!  You better read it!!!
0783225547|4.0|I really didn't have high hopes for this flick - I assumed a volcano disaster lent itself, by it's very nature to formulaic Hollywood disaster genre, and this film is indeed formulaic, but somehow it manages to succeed.<br /><br />I think one reason it succeeds is the extreme events enveloped into the story - little happens in this film that is half-baked - this is pedal-to-the metal, no-holds-barred disaster unfolding on the screen, and the characters get caught up in extreme, very extreme, natural phenomena realistically depicted via special effects.<br /><br />The only really bad part of this film is the opening sequence - a volcanic eruption in Columbia - in which the protagonist's (Pierce Bronson's) girlfriend opines excitedly about the \\"stories they will have to tell\\" as they witness, through their car's windshield, people perishing all around them in a hail of molten shrapnel. If you can stomach this without retching, you'll enjoy the remainder.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Hi E-1 this movie was a Thriller which I thoroughly enjoyed! The movie came very quickly & this is the 2nd or 3rd movie I ordered from goHastings. Never have a problem with his movies!! TY for being so prompt , An I hope E-1 likes this movie as much as I did excellent movie.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is a nice time passing game to just relax and de-stress with.  The multiple stacks is different, but doable.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Movie came before time which is great, Love Charlize Theron & Kristen Stewart. I wish the plot was a little better but still enjoyed the movie,it had some great parts in it,I would recommend to my friends & family. TY
B00A757EFW|3.0|Very retro game which is nice and relaxing, but getting back to the Kindle home page should be easier than it is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is good!! There is always something happening! It keeps you wanting to read more!!!! I can only imagine what the 3rd book will be like!!!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|We can see why this won the award for best picture-such stunning graphics even though the story is sad. Good prices you have..
B009GX6600|5.0|We are still in the season, but so far have enjoyed watching as I can, Very seldom do I get to see it sired at the time on TV.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This order was cancelled and you sent it anyway. I cancelled it 5 minutes after the made the order as it could not get to its destination in time. I also emailed you two other times confirming this. As well, it said, &#34;has not shipped&#34; when I did this...Please let me know what to do about these materials.
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|this was not very good. My 2 kids ages 10 and 11 they did not enjoy this very much either.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|We all love this show and even if we see it, we want the DVDs too. Such an interesting time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter and my husband love to play this game. It is easy to play and fun game. Usually my daughter does not like to play computer games,but this game  is easy for her to understand and easy for her to figure out the tricks of the game. Now we all are on the hook. The graphic is excellent.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I don't have many friends that play this game but I have fun playing with theso  few that do!!  It also freezes up pretty often so that is a pain but if you get out & just go back in it works fine.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Having read the short story which Robin based this on I was unsure what to expect. As the book opened on, to me, familiar territory I was swiftly hooked by the depth and pacing of this sophisticated but incredibly approachable story.<br /><br />It is hard to categorize this book. Is it a detective story? Is it a story about the use (and misuse) of technology? Is it historical, contemporary or reaching out to touch the future? Is it a story of things or people? Yes, yes and yes to all of these.<br /><br />It is a voyage of discovery for both the characters and the readers as they question both the everyday, and look to the origins of technologies we take for granted while offering immortality... and the message revealed on the final pages... a denouement worthy of Hercule Poirot but delivered in a slideshow, that will leave you hoping for more from Mr Sloan's fertile imagination.<br /><br />To talk about the plot, or touch on the well developed characters would spoil the delicate surprise of the prose, suffice to say there are heroes and black robed villains, wise men and smart women. And Kale smoothies... but more than that you will have to discover for yourself!
B006YW6KX4|4.0|Loved it all, but disappointed in the 5.1 surround.  The sound effect of surround sound were barely noticeable.  One particular scene where the train is approaching in the beginning sounded like a typical mono system, no noticeable sound enhancement.  Compared to &#34;Big Country&#34; or &#34;Gigi&#34;, films of the same period, their 5.1 sound was far more dramatic and enjoyable.  Regardless, seeing the movie in a high resolution format was still a great experience that I will continue to enjoy for years.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Their relationship is SO draining. It lacked any real drama which could have been a great part of the story. Skipping over a possible Nathan entry was a mistake.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Terrifically done!  Wonderful combination of interviews, period footage and well-done reenactments.  A very compelling flick.  If you think it might be stuffy or boring, it's not.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|It takes way to long to load. Also it's reaction time to a request it's in slow motion. It acts like it get confused over simple functions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is like the best game ever its so fun.Yo can do it anywhere a any time.Thanks to the company that made this awesome game :-)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a pretty awesome app. Although it is a copy Temple Run. I like the stlye and grafics. Then again awesome butbut was a copied idea on the objective.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Free game for my Kindle.  The game is fine but there are only 4 games with about 14 screens that are similar.  Once you're done with all the screens your only option is to start over and see if you can better your times.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I adore this book. It paints with words. It's well worth the read and I don't want to say more because I believe that it's the sort of book that one should just read without having too much fore knowledge.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Wow. What a fantastic DVD. I've watched it twice in the movie, but still excited and enjoyed this DVD. The extras are great too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is any easy game to play even with all the upgrading that has to be done.  I even like to do the quests keeps me on my toes.
0785163174|5.0|The ultimate battle!!!  A good start for the new comic fan, A v X was a &#34;can't put it down&#34; story.  It seems almost every hero in the Marvel Universe is an X-Man or an Avenger, but no one seemed forced just to get into the story.  A must ahve HC for your collection.
1616550414|5.0|I love this book so much its like my holy bible of The Legend of Zelda. I adore the concept art the side comments and its just such a great buy! The green color is amazing and its just so great I wish I had a pedestal to put it on. xD
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best movies of all time, right up there with the original Star Wars, and certainly the best 'comic book' movie ever.  Robert Downey Jr has some great quips, Mark Ruffalo is terrific as Bruce Banner, and who doesn't love ScarJo?
B00BGIC170|1.0|This is the first time I buy a movie from Amazon and for sure this is the last time.<br /><br />I buy a movie and its not mine, I can watch it only on streaming or using an amazon software?!<br />I do not own the movie then!<br /><br />I am really disappointed by that service!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very believable characters! Shows the conflict between a small English hamlet and the larger village nearby. The young heroine constantly finds her days as postal clerk busy and challenging. The subplots involving the mailman, the dressmakers, and the Dowager Countess lend wonderful insights into a bygone era. Watch this one if you enjoy Downton Abbey or Emma!!
B002RKSU3K|5.0|I read this book as a young girl and started reading it to my children. I couldn't put it down and read the whole thing in 24 hours. I haven't done that in 20 years!  What a wonderful book and wonderful way to remember how much I love reading!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfers is a good game. Subway surfers does need some more options. I have never seen a game with with extra routs. The track sold have  some switches every once and a while. Boards and people should be not cost so many coins. Thanks.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love the actors chosen for this series.  Miller plays an eccentric Holmes perfectly, with just the right amount of petulance.  Especially like Liu as Dr. Watson.  She is sassy yet serious.  She has also been given a personality to equal Holmes', and imakes Watson much more than just the faithful sidekick.  Looking forward to Season 2.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read and re-read these books over and over, yet I can't seem to get enough. Great love story that provides inspiration to the notion that true love conquers all.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|The plots are getting more convoluted and less credible. The writers are running out of stories to recycle. The fragments of stories are not getting woven back in fast enough. I dunno, I am bored with it now and I was previously inspired by it. It's not creating \\"magic\\" for me now. More like Alice fell down the rabbit hole and never, ever got back home to tell an intelligible tale about what occurred there. Or Dorothy about Oz. I am not going to give up on it, but reruns of Monk, old movies, are more interesting in terms of story and acting, because Season 2 is going for special effects, shock value, and it's not living up to Season 1.<br /><br />What this series does have going for it is beautiful costumes, cinematography, and Henry. I like the other actors, I like the characters, but they are all always frustrated.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Good time waster. Ads are in a bad place when trying to pick up pieces. Pieces seem to get stuck at the top of the piece bar.
B003JTHESA|5.0|its a amazing album like you you can feel their lifetime of experience on all the song in there top 3 albums of all time if not thier best
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Awesome<br />book I wanted to cry in some parts of it. I wish I could find more books like that
0240815807|5.0|This book offers amazing value for the beginning and intermediate engineer.  The methodical method for editing and mixing described in this book has improved my workflow.  Mike Senior excels at laying out a smooth process for approaching a mix.  I've purchased two copies, one for console-side and one for bed-side.<br /><br />No kidding, get this book.  It is the best audio engineering book I've ever read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|And he can hardly wait to turn on the download whenever he comes to my house. Me, I'm not as interested in being scared by zombies, but the story line keeps developing which indicates that the creativity behind this series is very good.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I watched the PBS special with Andrea Bocelli and David Foster and we were overwhelmed.  The artistry and the mastery of Bocelli oozes from this CD.  It was also fantastico.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Ang Lee's presentation of the Life of Pi was a delight to me. I loved this book when I first read it, and I had trouble getting it out of my head for months.  My experience with movies made from books that I have loved has been mixed - some of the movies have been enjoyable and some have been disappointing, all for many and varied reasons, so I settled down in front of the flat screen TV to watch Life of Pi with my best open mind.<br /><br />Although it has been a few years since I read the book, the movie brought it back to me in waves of memories.  The film was visually stunning to me (You must stream this movie in HD to be stunned), and I didn't feel cheated by not having it in 3D, since the 5.1 surround sound was enough realism for me.  The tiger was magnificently created and was as real to me as any real tiger could be.  The love that Pi and Richard Parker shared developed as tenderly as any love story could, and showed the reality of human misperception of &#34;taming&#34; a wild animal. Pi was convincinly played as an adorable, if somewhat irascible, young man and as an engaging, deeply thoughtful adult.<br /><br />As with the book, the movie left me totally satisfied with the experience of the story, and with renewed questions about which version of Pi's story was really real. As with the book, in the end it didn't matter to me, because the story was so engaging, so entertaining and so lovely.
B008CRC506|5.0|I love this show and have watched it several times already.  Great acting, songs and music!  Many of the actors and dancers have appeared on Broadway, which adds to the entertainment value.  The special guests are high-caliber as well.  If you like Broadway musicals and the stories behind the scenes, you won't be disappointed.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I had wanted to see this film, but I wanted to read the book first....  I'm so glad I did.  This was a good story that griped me form the beginning ...  but when it really &#34;took off&#34; ..............  It became a great story...  I would recomend this book to everyone who has ever been in a relationship ...
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I can't believe it's been ten years since these guys were on jag then got their own show its always interesting I don't know what I'll do if its every canceled watch reruns I guess
B000FBFMIO|5.0|The entire Robin Hobb series flows smoothly, is creative and never dull.  This is actually book 5 of the series.  There is the original trilogy then the follow up Tawny Man Trilogy, which is a follow up following a 15-year break (in the book).
0571179924|4.0|GREAT book, like brand new. I HATE that I have to write such a long description, that's Amazons fault not the sellers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is one of my favorite book out of the series. Mostly because the reader learns more about Christian and how much he truely loves Ana. Somehow great authors always make the bad boy you should never date be the one you always want.<br />But I think not all people will like this book or series and that is okay. Personal, I love the fairytale story line this book has to offer.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|It didn't turn out to be what I thought it would be, i.e. a serious drama -- instead, it was a delightful and full of classic one-liners. Loved it at first sight!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I Read it twice. Inspirational for me to try different running techniques. Have recommended it to many of my friends.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellant show. Good plots. I have learned a lot about the law and how.the law can be manipulated. There is a lot going on in each show, which keeps it very interesting. Outstanding suspence and suspence show. I have watched each show back  to back and now I wait anxiously for each new episode!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely love this book I didn't want it to end! I need more of this I can't wait for the fourth book come on!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is cool. I got the doubler for the coins so you can get them to add up quickly. The upgrades make the cars really fast.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is good on the go but when it comes to pc version it sucks it needs more stuff and better worlds so get the pc until they update it
B008LG6SXS|5.0|I have found the site to be very efficient and to offer lots of options and competitive pricing. Would recommend to all!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My 12 year old likes this game. He had Temple Run 1 but wanted to update . Pretty good graphics. A monkey will chase you around a jungle setting.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love this show. Creative, well written, and the cast is perfect. To really apreaciate the show you must start with season 1 and be ready for a marathon of TV watching. Enjoy!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|It is the most accurate and dependable travel software available.  I use it everytime I plan a trip either near or somewhere in the USA.  I can use it from my Kindle or IPAD.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Cannot say enough about the beauty of this show!  The language, the cinematography, the accuracy of the times.  KUDOS to the creators!!
B002RXMG00|5.0|How could one not love it? My daughter and I watched it this past Monday because we've become addicted to the new A and E show &#34;Bates Motel.&#34; It has been at least twenty years since I've seen the movie, and it was just as I remembered it. Two things that my daughter said: Is it all in black and white? and It was good, but not scary. Well worth the $3.99.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love LOTR, and enjoyed the movie. Liked having the 3D, Blu ray, DVD, and digital copy( although uv is not my method of choice). Can't wait for part 2!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For any fan of the books, the show is and continues to be a source of great and accurate entertainment. Season 1 was great, and season 2 is no less incredible! Sex, violence, betrayal, and an engrossing story. What more could you ask for?!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|couldn't put this book down.  It captivated me, where I Didn't watch tv or put it down until finished.Now, I bought the sequel.
B0087EACJK|4.0|Clever game.  Enjoyable.  Worth the price. I love the mechanism of sliding the world around.  Creates a great puzzle/action type of game with the time limits.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This App is challenging, puuzzling and fun for the entire family. It is well worth the value. A great buy if you have kids.
B002WJI65S|5.0|The material is super sturdy.  The quality is much better than past purchases of Mario Plush toys.  My kiddo is happy.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very Interesting.  This lady gets results in the court room.  A very interesting program.  We will be watching all of this series.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|so glad i was able to finally get this movie at a reasonable price so i can play it for the grandkids at xmas time.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very Interesting.  This lady gets; positive  results in the court room. We will be watching all episodes of this program.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|this is such a nerd movie that it is a hit!  We watch it at least once a month and we just laugh like crazy.  vote for pedro!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|My 5 year old and I enjoy playing this game! We've had a blast so far! We can't wait to finish it!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I had the cover and was glad you had just the dvd.  the kids love this movie as well as myself!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was the best app ever and it is one of the most used apps on my device.  It is free so there is no reason you should not try it out. I think you will love it.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I read the last book in the series first and others out of order.  Each book is a wonderfl read on their own.  Not knowing all the charactors from prior books made getting toknow them much more interesting and left me with questions to have answered when reading books that came first.  Stone of Tears was wonderfully exciting and moving!  His books are well thought out!  It is too bad that they can't be made into movies (Ratings and expense issues).
B007HJ9NBE|2.0|Movie was slapped together and never captured the magic of the first film. Guy who played Kevin Bacon was a terrible actor.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Easy to select skill level and play.  It is Fun to watch the pieces move accross the board.  I Love it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is better than the first in graphics for sure. the only warning I give is NOT to select the HD graphics mode. the game freezes at loading. I had to remove and reload twice before I figured it out. This is the only reason for 4 stars on the review.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is so addicting. It involves a lot of strategy.You can get people to be allies also. If you are reading this... Get it!
B00386EZJU|3.0|I bought this CD because I loved the main theme.  When I played the CD, the main theme only appears at the beginning, and not much more until the end.  I was a little disappointed.
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|It's over a hundred yrs old and still a great read.  Each story is told in such a way as to spell-bind you. Just love it.
B005ZHB84U|3.0|This soundtrack wasn't at all what I expected.  The main theme, which is my favorite part, only appears briefly, and I was a bit disappointed.  It arrived in great condition and very quickly...that was good!
B005WQ39CI|5.0|Love the cast of the thriller even better than the original Robert Mitchum version.  Good movie even with the Simpsons parody.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The author has a way of building up to a situation to the level of The Red Wedding, and then nothing happens. Like he just decided to ignore where he was going. Also there wasn't much of a dance with dragons, it was like the game of just the tip. I love the series, but after book four which was horrible, I gave it another chance since there was book 5 already out. I hope that book six is then end, I don't know if I can take anymore teasing.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|absolutely love it. it looked a little bit on the cheap side to be honest but it's so much fun and i love watching ten's episodes with this thing. the pen comes off pretty easy, but it's never come off so easy that i've lost it (and it doesn't take a lot for me to lose something)
1439153663|5.0|Wonderful tale of life on a southern plantation and the horrible existence of the slaves.  A shock at the end but then redemption in the final pages.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|The story line went back and forth between time periods way too much....would have been much better if it had been more organized.
B003DTMUOE|4.0|Libro calido que alimenta el alma con narrativa que hace facil el razonamiento.<br /><br />Encontre en el inspiracion.<br /><br />El tesoro realmente no es material sino la lectura amena.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I feel I have been without. A great historical fiction for all to read. This is it. Moving to the next book now
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun but it makes me dizzy and I can not get passed the 1st few levels, my daughter can play it all day.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Some episodes are better than others, but as a whole it's good enough to subscribe to.  Looking forward to season 4!
B0034IZVV8|5.0|For lovers of boy bands everywhere, this is the playlist for you :)  If you don't like them, too bad, because it's some really good tunes.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the new update for AccuWeather.  It's easy to use and understand.  It even let's me know if it's. a good day to go fishing or not.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|My 9 year-old loves this game.  Be careful, however, to turn off the in-app purchasing as he almost spent $64 the first hour :)<br />Would recommend.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great overall game. I would recommend it for animal lovers and users of all ages. It's fun and actually helps teach about caring for pets.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love this app.  It makes it even more convenient for diehard amazon shoppers like me to spend all of our money ;)  My only beef is that I cannot purchase kindle books with this app.  Otherwise, love it!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|While equally well done in costume and cinematography, the story itself departed from the book, and is far weaker than the Trilogy. The plot and story line is poor.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|I have to dl  this app to install my browse Dolphin which  build in flash player  so I can watch those movie which require flash player
B009S33I68|5.0|Very intense and thoughtful narrative of events most of us ignored while they were happening.  Most of us have not, and will not experience combat, but need to have some concept of it as long as we need to send our young to war.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this app as much as my 4 yo and my 8 yo kids do. It has enough challenge for us all!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a very exciting and well written novel.  Read it, then see the movie! Recommended for adults as well as high schoolers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have enjoyed TWD since I watched the first episode.  I haven't read the Graphic Novel version (I want to be totally surprised!).  This third season has had its ups and downs (no spoilers), but, for the most part, I could not have asked for a more realistically aimed series.  The fights are good, the zombies provide more than just a background, but they are not the all-over theme.  The drama with the main characters is.  They have enough sub plots going on that you stay interested, but don't get confused.  I am looking forward to the season finale this round as I want to see what they came up with.  Also, looking very much forward to season IV?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This was so easy on the first levels.  The deeper you go, the more thought that goes into each puzzle.  Love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game available for the kindle fire.<br />Must Get!!! Please like Kiloo Facebook and Twitter. I`ve had the Rome version as well and it got boring just in time for Sydney.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking concert!  Sting definitely still has the chops and the strings are gorgeous. Every Sting fan MUST get this!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|We have the Magic in all of us. What a wonderful book to read! Sad for it to end,but very happy with the ending! With spring at our doorstep My daughter and myself may have to plant a garden!

B00BE5U7P8|5.0|This book is clear and concise.  It was well written for a beginner or as a review.  I highly recommend this book.
0887307280|5.0|Currently, I'm in the middle of another book, however, as soon as I finish that one, this is the next.  This book has been highly recommended and I'm looking forward to learning from others about how to be a successful entrepreneur.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Had some slow points, but overall a great movie. Managed to stick to facts and portrayed the fight to actually locate and kill Bin Laden.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|The writing and the character development on this show are excellent. Hopefully, it will be picked up for season 2
