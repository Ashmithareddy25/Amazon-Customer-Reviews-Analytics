B00F91SCXC|3.0|Brad Pitt good as always, but just too many holes in the story. The Last of Us is a video game, and has a way better storyline.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|Good read.  Each topic take. On its own is nothing particularly new but as a whole it gives you new insight into the negative parh to happiness.  I relly liked it and hope to include some of the suggestions into my daily life.
1439199388|5.0|Velasquez-Manhoff presents decades of scientific literature on the &#34;hygiene hypothesis&#34; in this easy to read book. Be prepared for a raft of contradictions (supported by science) on what you thought you knew about hygiene and health. A hope giving read for anyone suffering from allergies or autoimmune disease
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this show! Im so happy that amazon prime has season 3! Great quality too.. can't wait for season 4 to come out.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this story of a doctor who experienced  a look into the &#34;afterlife&#34;<br /><br />It was truthful, as the doctor was not predisposed to believing in heaven or hell.<br /><br />It was well written, and the relationships in the book show a strong family with<br />very difficult struggles.<br /><br />Well written, a very good read.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I'm hooked on the characters and story line.  It's fast paced and has enough law, politics, love interests, drama and comedy for me.  More intelligent that LA Law and all the other mainstream law shows.  Love the wardrobe...the women wear gorgeous clothes on their skinny bodies.  The characters are pretty to gorgeous, but not so much so that I can't relate.  I've been hooked.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Awesome season. Just as good as the first with a great ending. Sherlock delivers the goods again and again. Looking forward to Season 3!!!
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Beautiful, distinct vocals combined with excellent song writing. Destined to be a classic, at least in my library. Varied tempos that keep pulling you in and yet consistent vibe throughout. Love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have always liked these period series, and this one is really good.  It gives a real feel for life in the 1915 thru 1920 era.
1444760637|5.0|Here is one hero not diminished by his biography.  Not for one moment a plaster saint, his flaws were those of youth and an impetuous nature.  This would make a great novel, but it really happened.
B007MDB71O|4.0|A charming fantasy about romance, bravery and war made in a believable manner among strange beings on a strange planet.  Great fun..
B008XJ8WE6|3.0|But watch the seen with Pharoah.  Some of the woman's clothing isn't really appropriate for kids.  It kept their attention though
B00D3LA5WG|2.0|The reviews sounded so promising: 2 boys discover a man living on an island, and he has tales to tell them: sort of a Mark Twain appeal. Turns out he's just a liar and the plot really goes nowhere.
B006LSZECO|5.0|For a first time reader of Gillian Flynn I was hooked after the first chapter. A story written from the male and female perspectives, it kept me captivated! A great read.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|The movie has amazing actors coming together to create a great movie. I love British actors and I love the writing on this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game because you can change the character.  I enjoy the zip line and that you can slide, jump, and go to the side. Also the increased speed is really cool. If you do really good you get to drive in a cart. Data
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great looking clocks, easy to use,Is think everybody should get it. Waking up to music is fantastic and the sleep button is a must. The only I wish it had was more color options.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Easy to download, store in the cloud, or both.  Easy to access and high quality video and sound. I don't recommend the season pass option since it doesn't really save much money, just pennies, and you are locked in to buying episodes you may be able to dvr.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Absolutely love watching harvey do his thing, he is clearly the man.  Meghan Markle is unbelievably beautiful and she is a phenominal Rachel.
B00633W614|4.0|Archer has a gift for telling long tales and telling them well. You feel like you know the characters and are right there with them through their various ordeals. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|It's so bad every CD and season is damaged I tried it on two different laptops and both damaged so I don't think the problem is with the laptops
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is awesome. So many cool features and you have to play it. Absolutely must have. If you don't have it get it. Amazing characters and the graphics are awesome.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|First, I have to say I loved the movie and everything about it. Now, the product is amazing since it includes scenes I hadn't watched in the theaters, so it explains different things. The case is nice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|beer game ever some times you get to cheat on it and it a easy game to play and there is good people you can ger
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett has a  way  of keeping the balance between historical events and the ways in which the characters are affected that makes  Fall of Giants an especially good read!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Tried to play this game repeatedly, but couldn't get out of the tutorial. I deleted this game as it was useless to me.
1612680011|4.0|I think it is worth the read, it is a bit of a repeat of his first book, but I came out with a better understanding of what he was trying to say.  I liked his &#34;pop psychology&#34; hints on how to make it happen.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed keeps you riveted for the next chapter. Great reading. Would like to read more of author books enjoy
1476734941|5.0|I read this book at 71 yrs of age and it has changed dramatically the way I eat and I weigh exactly what I have always wanted to weigh  and I am able to maintain it for the first time in my life.  My motivation for holding to their syste, are the very convincing health reasons that are given in the book.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The book starts off slow at the beginning but picks up later on. Some parts are predictable, while others surprise you. The idea and ending disturbed me a little. Guess I got to read the next one
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This novel was a bit slow in the beginning but I urge readers to stick with it.  The end result is well worth it in the end.  Beautiful story.
B00A285OOW|4.0|If you don't enjoy English History, 15th Century, Forget about it. But I do, and I enjoyed the Novel. When you read it consider the current Royals and their history.<br />It also brings to mind the Senate & House of today. Lots of Crazies, fighting for Power.<br /> To bring clarity read the Kingmakers Daughter, the Lady of the River, and the White Queen, all by author  Phillippa Gregory, all GREAT READS for Fictional History buffs. The author does extensive research but does take some liberties in the keeping it interesting for the reader.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This album is by far the best album I've bought all year. Super Sexy beats to chill by yourself, friends, or with that special someone. I highly recommend this album!
B002M5E2DW|4.0|The book really reminds you to keep a positive mind thought.  And once you have that in mind, its hard not to enjoy your day, your week, or your life better.
0756666937|5.0|My son loves the book.  He used it for a research paper and learned a lot about LEGO.  Pricing was just right!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Excellent CD! It shows Josh spreading his wings and trying a few new things while still staying true to his genre!
B00005LOUP|2.0|It was in fair condition I actually bought this as a replacement for a library cd.  It worked out ok
B00B52F278|5.0|The story was captivating, sad and poignant. It was like a good book, I &#34;couldn't put down&#34; I watched the DVD in 3 evenings, The real Spartacus' body was never recovered after the final battle, so he may have either escaped across the mountains, or could have died in battle. But for my part, I liked the way the creators resolved the end of this Epic series.
1423136802|5.0|I bought this for my 8 and 10 year old boys and they can't put them away.  They take their books everywhere with them and English is their second lenguage.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Keeps great time, particularly for an automatic. Looks good, too.  Great size, not enormous like the &#34; bling&#34; watches I see in most stores. I expect to buy more in other colors.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|I read this book which I thought was amazing, obviously a very intelligent and scientific mind and incredible thought processes from this Dr. As I am a<br />Christian I am looking at his experience from a biblical point of view and also from lots of other NDE's I have read and can't help but think there is something missing here. Jesus was never mentioned once and as it is written in the bible that the only way to Heaven is though Jesus and belief that he came to earth and died for our sins once and for all. Dr Alexander did not know Jesus personally and so I came to the decision that God shown him the otter reaches of heaven and hell and he was given another chance to come back to earth hopefully he will come to know his Lord and Saviour.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is really a great game. I feel that anyone that plays this game will love it! Happy playing!!!!!!  Love it!!!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|The graphics and music pretty much sets up the mood for the game. The objective is to hit people with the ball which can be straight forwards shots or rebounds ...the more people you hit with single ball ...the better you score.<br />I liked it
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have been using this app for about a week now as a part of &quot;sleep training&quot;, as I suffer from varying levels of insomnia.  This is a wonderful relaxation tool.  I love being able to mix my own favorites to compile the sounds that are the most soothing to me.  I use the timer to gradually wake and I must say I am very well rested in the morning!  This is a fantastic alternative to medication-only options.  Try it out!!
B008JFUPK8|1.0|At first I was not excited to see this movie, then I warmed up to it with the amazing cast in the trailers.  Then I saw the movie.  This film was, in my opinion unnecessarily edited non-linear.  It really didn't add anything and actually was confusing for my buddy's 7 year old.  It would have been nice to see Superman save people in this film rather than the \\"Old Transformers Standby\\"  ..\\"We've run out of script, so let's have Zod and Superman throw each other through buildings for the remainder of the film.\\"  Yawn.  Long Live the Richard Donner 1978 Superman.  The truly BEST Superman Movie!
140006922X|5.0|I may have known some of this history, but it is quite fascinating to put it into perspective in today's climate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|How much easier can it get than using this app?! Easy to download....basic setup. I had never used Pinterest before...I was new to any social media...this app gives you all the know how on how to set up your Pinterest  account. Very easy to use! Definitely get!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The writing and acting is so great<br />Makes watching the other criminal/legal shows a waste of time.<br />Always several layers of action going on.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|You will need this free app if you are going to search on Google. Recommend highly. A lot more apps available for this computer.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|Love, love, love this CD.<br />Jack has taken everything from his previous great CDs, well maybe sleep through the static wasn't so great,<br />put it all together and then some... to come up with this masterpiece.<br />The guitar work in this CD is stunning and creative...<br />Jack's vocals are just getting better and better...<br />Not a weak track to be found...<br />with Ones and Zeros the stand out track, for me.<br />followed closely by Shot Reverse Shot, Washing Dishes, Don't believe a thing I say<br />and Home..... followed closely by all the other great tracks... like I said not a dud to be found.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just love hinging blitz. Nice challenging rooms. Love the consept of the no trade items. Makes completing the rooms more challenging even though it may be harder or take longer to complete a room.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I already had this DVD, just needed to get a copy in Blu-ray.  It is an excellent video for the whole family!<br />DVD arrived quickly from this seller.
B004X80QNG|4.0|I've been using it for many months and It's really useful. However I've not tested many different ones so I can't give 5 stars
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is one of my favorite games to play. it is truly a great game not only for single played but also a multi-player game. I play on a Kindle all the time. Keepup the good work.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is a true winner.  Easy to use, quick response time and very addictive.  Good selection options for changing the mood of things.
0802473156|3.0|This book just didn't hit home with me.  I don't know if it's because of where I was in my relationship but I may have to pickup at another time.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago had some incredibly innovative songs on this album, and the musicianship is phenomenal.  This is quintessential jazz rock, by the founders of jazz rock.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Dont even know if it worked like it said. Loaded it on my Nexus 7 and it got VERY slow all of the sudden because of all the push ads. Uninstalled.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Alpha and Omega. Ohmygod. This cd is for Asia fans who have been waiting for some new tunes from one of the best progressive rock superbands of the 1980's.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Good game, although it is no where as addictive as some of the other puzzle games. It does take a little forethought though.
B001L51RQE|5.0|I used to love a live show, that was until they started charging upwards of $75 for a nosebleed seat located behind a fat dude who refuses to sit down. Watch this live and in the comfort of your living room and you will  have a seat, not in the front row, but on the stage. Awesome film production values.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use a lot of PDF files, and this way, I can take them with me on my tablet.  Thanks, Adobe!
B000000OMB|5.0|I played this album so many times  that it eventually wore out,so I had to replace it. This is one of the few cd/tapes that needs to played in its entirety and in the original song order. I own the other Asia albums as well, and they are all good, but this one was their first and it stands out in a class of its own. It was great in the 80's and it still is now.
0553801473|5.0|This is great fun--we finally know about Tyrion and Dany and Jon and Arya and so on and so forth, AND there's lots of new twists and turns (and a great deal of ominous foreshadowing--something Martin does better than ANYBODY). So even though you get few final answers, there is still plenty of fun and LOTS of future plot material! Some characters do really dumb things, as usual, but at that they aren't any dumber than most of the folks at the office--quite a few of whom found it a difficult read. One suspects they didn't pay enough attention to detail in previous books--or fail to understand just how tightly woven this all is and how important the new characters and places and other details are (or will eventually become). So yeah, there ARE lots of new ones, but come ON now--EACH of these volumes has approximately the same amount of story as the actual text in the ENTIRE LORD OF THE RINGS so you are BOUND to run into some new things now and then. And of course since we know that All Men are Mortal, you don't have to worry about your poor brain getting TOO overloaded because we can count on Martin to kill OFF a few for us......
078322737X|5.0|This is George Lucas' warmup to his Star Wars trilogy. It is innovative story telling that tells three stories at the same time. The music alone is worth watching the movie for. It is in my top ten list of films ever.
B0034G4P80|4.0|OK, there have been better movies made of characters in the Marvel Universe. On the other hand there have been MUCH worse, and THIS one was really and truly necessary--we HAD to meet our big blonde buddy and understand his noble nature and lack of cultural sophistication and his bloody HUGE ego, prior to being able to experience the enormous fun of The Avengers. So while it's true that the plot in this one is pretty obvious and PARTICULARLY true that the characters lack a bit in polish, that's kinda the whole POINT here dontchaknow.  So it's well worth watching, especially given that all of them are really colorful--there's not a ONE of them in the entire MOVIE that I wouldn't enjoy going drinking with, including even the BAD GUYS. And it's nice to see that Nat is improving in her choice of men--last time it was a Sith Lord but THIS time it's a GOD--one with feet of clay to be sure but at least she didn't decide to shack up with LOKI!  So if only for HER sake, buy this one and enjoy it--or Nick will be FURIOUS and and the God of Thunder will be MIGHTY THOR........
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This is probably the best foreign film ever made. If you love the movies, old movies especially, you need to watch this film. My one piece of advice is to watch the original theatrical release as it tells a much better story. The director's cut goes in a direction that the original release does not and it lets the viewer down on many levels. Film buffs would appreciate a comparison of the  two versions, but you only have time to watch one version, watch the original release as it is more kid friendly PG13 whereas the directors cut contains nudity and sex scenes which make the film lose its charm.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Love this show show always a good way to end the day and keeps me wanting more.this series is cast perfect with intriguing episodes and shocking moments you don't see coming .
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffery Archer is a great author.  He goes into great detail and the plot keeps you wanting to get back and read more.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Very enjoyable series. Follows a family and their extended family.  The family is set in a country estate and makes it quite interesting.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|They did such a great job of casting for these new Star Trek movies.  This one does not disappoint either.
031623480X|5.0|I have all of Dr. Perlmutter's books, he is a friend and a brilliant researcher and neurologist. I love when doctor's are honest with us, and tell us the truth about drugs, and help us by recommending simple things, dietary tweaks, health foods and/or supplements. Grain Brain is a must have for your book shelf, he really hit it out of the park this time. It's easy to read, and each chapter has something new and interesting. You owe it to yourself to get a copy, even if you think you know everything about the foods you're consuming. You'll learn how to protect yourself from nerve damage, and help any kind of autoimmune disorder. Dr. Perlmutter specializes in illnesses that affect the brain and since his works amazingly well, I'm doing everything he says! Seriously, his memory is like a steel trap, and he's sharp, pulls studies and references out of thin air. He's amazing! If you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's, Graves, Sjogren's, Lupus, MS, or any other autoimmune illness, get a copy. Get one for your friend. Living grain-free is not hard at all. It's especially easy with all the options available to you today and the help offered within this book. You can even prevent certain illnesses from developing in the first place in my opinion. If you have the opportunity to hear Dr. David Perlmutter speak, I highly recommend that, he is always fantastic, funny and brilliant, worth the plane ticket and registration fee.<br />Seriously, see him if you get the chance, listen to him, and live better.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Vivid writing that never ceases to feed the reader. There are four main characters - an aging, once successful writer and her brilliant, possibly slightly autistic artist/autodidact husband who live on a remote island off the Northern Pacific Coast. Ruth, the writer, followed her man from NYC to this outpost, and now, crippled with writer's block, she finds washed up on the shore the carefully wrapped and barnacle covered diary of a young and sassy, but broken 16 year old Japanese girl, Nao, who may or may not be dead, possibly lost in the tsunami. The fourth character is Nao's father, once a successful video game software developer recruited by Silicon Valley during the dot com bubble, and now, living in a two room apartment back in Tokyo, with his wife and daughter, and a chronic focus on suicide. The family has been ripped from a middle class existence in Sunnyvale, CA., and it is the daughter who is most driven to hang on for a while - she too plans to kill herself - but her commitment to her diary and unknown future reader -  she writes in direct address to whomever might find this book - and Ruth's need for the truth of what happened, and her hope to find and rescue the girl (and herself) are the narrative engine. The best book I've read in a while, crossing genres of Mystery, with both contemporary culture and historical fiction, and with deeply and perfectly wrought characters. There is even a very recognizable, ornery cat, for those who like cats. And a tragic Kamikaze pilot, for those who like war novels. And a convincing 104 year old Zen Buddhist nun, who cracks a door open to Zen. The plot is complex, the structure elegant and highly readable.
0307277453|5.0|I studied Marine Biology as Mayor, and this a well written and delightful book, a must for human and fish lovers...
147674355X|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It kept me captivated the entire time. Making it extremely difficult to put down. Colleen Hoover is definitely a brilliant writer and because of this book I'm beginning to read all of her work.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Far too long for the nature of the content fount it became boreing.Found it good as a sleeping potion.Thank you
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this is a decent app for a free one. wish the alarm could be alittle louder with the volume all the way up it's herd to hear with some of the alarm options
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|New obsession. LOVE this show. The characters are smart and witty. I enjoy just looking at the ladies designer fashions and the way they walk. I think every woman on this show went to sexy walking 101. And the men, well the men.... Harvey and Mike make my heart race and louis is always entertaining.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Fool of studies and amazing insights and tips on how we are wired, why we do what we do, and how to change it.
B000UMXCTY|3.0|One of the cd's I received does not work.  It says error in reading.I did not keep the receipt .  It did not occur to me that one of the cd's would not be readable..
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|A beautiful end to her trilogy! Her writing is as sharp and poignant as ever. The multiple layers of story telling and the continued character development make this book worth it. I truly loved it!
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|This movie has everything. Music, dancing, drama, over-the-top comedy, romance and inspiration. I watch it when I need a smile and a laugh. It's one of those movies that you smile and sigh when the ending credits roll and say, &#34;wow, that was a good movie&#34;! It's a very satisfying movie; a gem.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Highly addictive but great fun and easy to play. If you like bingo you will love this game .
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It's a fun game. Doesn't have the punch that the regular Ipad game has, but not bad for this pad.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It makes you think and is unlike most other games I've played.  You have to put some serious thought into later levels.
B0081336FO|5.0|Acting and writing is top notch.  The twist, and turns keep you on edge.  I can't wait for season 3 to begin!
B000000P17|5.0|This is one hell of an album. It brings a different vibe than Appetite for Destruction, but it certainly sounds like authentic Guns N' Roses.
B009LDD590|5.0|This is a gift for my Mother and I will continue to purchase the next season as long as there is one to purchase.
B0000027RL|5.0|The best band of the 90s comes out with an album not to be forgotten. The song Jeremy is the one to listen to.
B004E5GG50|5.0|These were a great gift for my mother. I will continue to purchase movies for my mother. Great movies for her.
B000000OQY|5.0|This is an amazing album from the rock band. I especially love One in a Million. This album never gets old.
159463176X|4.0|The multiple family threads and interweaving of the characters is extremely well done.  I enjoyed the Kite Runner and I wasn't sure about reading another book centered in the same region.  And the Mountains Echoed is completely different with the same look in at the society pre US involvement and after.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|This is easily one of Slash's best album to date considering the fact that the album was recorded with a group of very talented all star artists and musicians. This is a must buy.
1451695195|5.0|This was a very informative, detailed book and I think mainly for all the skeptics out there. There are so many choices for literary work yet this one will bring meaning to ones life. Thank you Eben for your courage and perseverance to write it!
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is a classic even though it came out 2 decades ago. The songs compiled together are just perfect in every way.
B0054JELS4|5.0|My husband and I have finally reached the end of season 8 of our NCIS CD's. Time to order more!
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a great album and one of the best for Nirvana right next to Nevermind. Anyone interested in classic music should listen to Heart Shaped Box.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|What a great game - easy to pick up & keeps you coming back for more!!! Highly recommended to all ages!
B000000OSG|5.0|The first album was amazing, but this one was even better with the addition of Civil War. Sadly, this was the last album Slash would ever create as a Guns N' Roses member.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Gave this to my husband for his birthday. He resvd it on the actual release date! He said I hit it right on the spot! He LOVED it!! He said it has the BEST 3D effects EVER! Extremly happy I bought this for him!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This debut album easily puts Guns N' Roses at the top of the mountain. This is a debut album that made them the world's greatest rock band for awhile.
B000P0J024|5.0|a must have.  all that needs to be said. I find myself playing it over and over again.  you won't be disappointed.
1408810263|5.0|First book I read with this format. Loved it made we want to know more about the time, place and people
0345803493|5.0|Awesome book the first one was real good I couldn't put it down at all. Then I received my second book omg I couldn't but the book down. I finish the book in 3 days.
B008YAPRPG|5.0|Great packaging, fast delivery the disk looks great. I recommend having the latest firm loaded on your bluray player, or else the special features won't load.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I both read this book.  Discussions afterward opened up a channel of communication,  helped us know each other better.  Would recommend to all my kids and their spouses.
078322947X|3.0|Super fast delivery but the disk was a little scratched. Does anyone know if there will be a newer release or a bluray coming out soon?
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I bought the book and then wanted to see the movie.  So I bought this DVD.  It's great--grandkids love it!
B00BKTFABE|1.0|Not sure why, but it won't record video, the screen just freezes up.<br />Isn't it suppose to be able to record video?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Does this really need a review?  It's the Avengers, driven by Joss Whedon.  If you're reading reviews for this movie at this point, I can't really help you. If you liked Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, or Thor, then you should, and prolly already have, seen this.
B00COCY67A|5.0|As a big fan of the King, some of the songs on this collection of CDs were not on the current CDs I had.  I like hearing some of the takes that were not on the final recordings and compare them with the final songs (all on these 3 CDs) plus I like to hear the conversation among the band members and Elvis. So, to Stax, thank you very much.
B004132HZS|5.0|If your a Dr Who fan expect to be Sher-locked.  Steven Moffat again makes you laugh, cry and swear.  Mostly because the season is only 3 episodes long!!  But they are about an hour and a half each.  Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect and Martin Freeman is flawless as always.  Stay calm and hate Anderson.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This movie is a definate twist to the original story. It is violent and is an adult version of the classic tale, not your bedtime type story for younger kids. Acting and storyline are good and the witches are neat. There's even a house made of candy and gingerbread and guess who's inside??
B000068FXX|5.0|I love this album- Bought the vinyl in the 80s, bought the CD in the 90's, and buying the MP3 now!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Tom Cruise is great in this movie. He is tough as nails and is good at hurting people. He will stop for nothing to find the truth hence the beatings his victims endure.. Acting and story are great with a very predictable ending. Robert Duvall was an excellent supporting actor..
B0091QS88K|1.0|I got this thinking that this would be awsome and fun but it was a first but the eggavore kept on ordering eggs and others smoothies and a platter it's lame because when you exit the game it shuts down and keeps on doing it for 10 minutes and you gotta quickly remove it completely and it shuts down for 1 minute and its fine I say to all the games<br /><br />I don't recommend at all
B0092QITO2|5.0|Cant compare to original with Arnie but this is a real good, updated remake.  It doesnt follow the original entirely so there is some originality which is good. (No Mars, no Quatto to name a couple)Plenty of action, fast moving, great effects and Kate Beckinsale and Jennifer Beil are great co-stars.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|Very touching and sweet movie.  Love the 2 main stars in this. love how &#34;Miss Potter&#34; evolved into a self sure and confident woman.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a great movie, good story, good character development, however I fail to understand how 72 high yeild torpedos which exploded inside Admiral Marcus's killer starship did not destroy it. When the crew is returning from Kronos to earth the trip only took about 1 minute. The trip would have taken alot longer than that.  Sending a shuttle to Kronos from the neutral zone?? Actually they broke down outside the neutral zone..  That would take a long time in a shuttle woudn't it? Oh well, If you can get by several minor but noticable inconsistencies, this movie is alot of fun..full of action, a couple tender moments and you may even shed a tear. I look forward to the next installment.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love it!<br />From a neurological point of view how could anyone not believe?  I realize there will be naysayers, but they will be believers some day!
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Cowboys, Indians, aliens and out of this world techno gadgets..what more could you want? This movie has good effects and the aliens were neat, mean looking aliens with internal chambers with little arms that reach out for you? This movie is a fun time.  Get the popcorn and relax..
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|My daughter has been asking me for this DVD for weeks and she was super excited when she opened it on her birthday!! She really likes the movie and has watched it several times.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great fun for all.  I was able to teach my elderly mother how to use bingo blitz in a short time.  It is a great source of entertainment for her.
1476712042|5.0|I thought this was amazing. I love the love story from both sides of Travis and Abby. Both the books are super good
B00705GEO4|5.0|These guys are close to being the best power metal band in the world. The lyrics are powerful in this concept cd that covers the rise and fall of the swedish empire fr 1610 to 1710. Carolus rex was the last emperor who ascended the throne at 15 and was a military genius. The cd covers this period  listen to the words.

B00C2IGQEW|5.0|The movie was not the only thing great about this purchase. The box was even better then i expected it to be.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If I had any doubts about Heaven, I don't now!  I loved it.  Read it and you'll believe it too.
B000Q67876|5.0|Yes there is honor inside of the walls of prison. Great actors and a superb story of prison, friendship and honor amongst inmates.
0060245867|5.0|This book teaches and demonstrates to children about expectations. This shows a child in a simple yet interesting format the value of being grateful for what they have
B003Y5USF0|5.0|This is an old all time favorite for our house hold. We just went to universal and saw how the movie was made, really cool to see it behind the sences
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good story telling.  Characters that were easy to become invested in.  Loved it and can't wait to get Shift series.  Ordering now....
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|All the main music of Michael Jackson enters this CD. I hear this CD in my car, and it's fun every time.
B000002H7I|3.0|There was only one song out of the entire CD that I liked.  But, I like Tracy Chapman anyway, so it's worth keeping.
B000GOWM2O|4.0|My wife and I very much enjoyed watching this movie. No bad language, no violence. A nice story with a happy ending.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the simple traditional solitaire in an easy clear presentation Fun to play it when I just want to relac my mind.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Easy read but so sad. It is hard to get over the cruelty of the capital and the hunger games.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Franzen is a contemporary must read author You can read it from a shallow perspective or analyse its deeper meaning. His style is different,it brings the reader an interest to keep reading.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I love all things Star Trek, since it started in the 1960's<br />The new crew, Kirk, Uhura, Spock and Scotty are great.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|Inspiring, glorious, a must watch watch. Drama, comedy, action, and fantastic acting. This movie inspires one to live life to the max, love to the max, and believe to the max.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|This concert was always special to me as I had listened to it live on WNEW on New Year's Eve 1971<br />As a 15 yr old growing up in New Jersey. This is the table book edition of the Rock of Ages Cd. While I<br />bought the cd and expanded editions having the book and couple of videos brings me back to that night<br />When I was 15. I love this collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|when you download this app you might as well through your social life out the window because your not gonna want to do anything but play this game!!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|this song is pretty cool I guess if u like daft punk its kinda repetitive I guess but ovall its pretty good I guess

IF YOU HAVE NOT VIEWED VIDEOS WITH CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THIS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT AND TRULY INSIGHTFUL MAN.  YOUTUBE.COM IS THE SITE TO VIEW THESE STIMULATING VIDEOS.  WE ALL WISH WE COULD BE SO WITTY AND HONEST.
B0063GORYU|1.0|There are WAY too many ads in this game for my liking. I do not like my game play interrupted by pop up ads.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|love the boook, but what happens next. where is the rest of the story line. need more of this book
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|I'm usually not a big fan of pinball but i will say this game is pretty good. It has sound effects from the movies that play when you do something specific in the game which is pretty cool since I'm a Star Wars fan. The only negative part i can find is that only one table is available unless you do an app purchase so i took a star off for that. So if your a Star Wars fan you'll enjoy this game.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|My unit worked fine for about two weeks and then it stopped updating the sleep pattern data.  After that it stopped updating all info.  It no longer syncs with Bluetooth.  I have gone to the withings website and followed the instructions for these problems, including a hard reset of phone and the Pulse unit itself.  Still not working.<br /><br />Most of the bad reviews here are for exactly the same problem and nobody seems to be getting good answers.
B000W94FE6|1.0|I stopped reading at the seventh chapter. It needed to move along more quickly for me. I'm glad she's better now though.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The game is not as interesting as I had hoped.  Perhaps it is meant for the younger set.  Its well done and the graphics seem good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. It started out a little on the slow side but once it picked up, it was great. It took me less than 2 days to finish this book.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|A terrifying tale of the world's descent into madness. A \\"final solution\\" gone horribly awry pits desperate survivors against maddened crowds to deliver a cure to the perpetrators.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I loved the movie came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to watch with my kids and husband
159463176X|2.0|This book is not nearly as good as the author's others.  It is very disjointed and also difficult to follow the many different characters and the 'stories within the story'.  Perhaps my dislike of the book is heightened because I don't have time to read for hours at a time - sometimes just minutes at a time - so some of the confusion could be due to having to 'catch up' each time I pick up the book.<br /><br />However, it is definitely not as brilliant as the author's other books for which I could read a page at a time and still yearn for my next opportunity to pick up the book.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I loved the movie came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to watch with my kids and husband
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I have read other biographies of Babe Ruth, and I saw the movie where he was portrayed by William Bendix (awful, in the sense of accauracy).  This book appears to capture the true life and times of the greatest baseball player of all times.  Someone said when you start ranking the best baseball players you start with Babe Ruth and go from there.  How did he get to be that ballplayer?  And what did he do along the way?  This book tries to answer those questions.  Some will never be answered, and the writer acknowledges that, and he does it in a way that makes the story interesting.<br /><br />The book is well written, and flows very well.  I found it to be one of those books that I hate to finish, because I enjoyed reading it so much.  If you enjoy biographies or a fondness for baseball history I think you will enjoy this book.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I ha  originally gotten this app. to combat snoring  ,but since I have used it camping ,with noisy company and even a hospital stay. Having my second major back surgery I was dreading the noise that goes on in a hospital knowing what pain I would  he in. Then I remembered my app. on  my kindle. I had taken it to read. It save  me and made my stay much more healing. Buy it for just about any occasion

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is my new favorite movie!  I hadn't seen a movie in a while that is as entertaining, powerful, creative and beautiful.  The themes of reincarnation and karma are wonderfully done.  It is great how the same actors are used throughout to play their new incarnations through time even when they are different genders and races.  must see!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I loved the movie came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to watch with my kids and husband
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really like the option of the light dimmer on the digital clock face.  Most digital  clocks are beacons in the night.  Very handy clock.
1455523550|5.0|I loved the book came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to read with my kids and husband
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|Was packaged nicely... and had additional scenes / extended version that I had not seen before... I love this movie and wish more movies were made like they used to be. The blu ray version has benefited from a nice visual upgrade.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I loved the movie came in great shape, Just what I wanted, Great to watch with my kids and husband
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Amazing!!! Love the show every season just gets better and better and also glad that amazon has them all! Love!!!
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Love John Mayer - I like all of the songs.  However, this is not one of his classics, but it is good.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Exemplifies the power of hope. Shows how one's hope can possess them and make a person lose his or her poise.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I liked the introduction in the beginning it make me think about perspectives as I read. Great story and I do think the author captured how children speak and perceive the world especially when u r gifted.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|This movie was a great action packed adventure.  It weaved Star Trek history together with the J.J Abrams style.  Very suspensful!
1572814349|5.0|The cards are beautiful and the descriptions are very clear. Simply amazing and for such low price. Definitely can recommend this product.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Great film, doesn't try to make a love story. Can't wait for a part 2. The quality of the picture is worth the watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this was the best game ever. but my question is why did you copy the temple run?<br />s<br />anyways can't wait to see the movie
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A phenomenal ending to the best series of books ever. I will read this series again. I am sad to have it end.
B00EX5FO3G|5.0|My child is a Lego fan and a Minecraft fan. This is a wonderful item and product. Very well instructed to put together and he loves it. It simulates Minecraft perfectly and enjoyed by my child every day. You can do so many things with it and let your child use their imagination to do so much more as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game and easy to play.  Not too many rules to learn.  Even got the hubby to download and play it.  I'm really enjoying this game.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Yes, it is a prequel to Aliens.  Love the scenary filmed in the movie, I keep watching it over and over.
B005USZML4|4.0|little slow starting , but then got going, enjoy all of Gresham books..Theodor Boone this will make third I have read
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Just goes to show that a movie can have a good story line, not be gory, and not have so much offensive language or sex scenes, and still be a hit. If only other movie makers could go to school on this. World War Z has plenty of suspense and chilling moments to satisfy the mood for a thriller.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I will make this short. If you read the book you won't recognize anything in the movie except maybe the title. Now for why I am writing this review: The damn box says \\"unrated version\\", well not so fast. Only the Bluray disk is unrated, the 3D disk is not. WTF? Not happy.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Whole series was riveting.  One of the best shows on tv.  I'm sorry that it ended.  The actors were amazing and the story always kept one on the edge not knowing where it was going next.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|A fun and challenging game.  Easy to play.  It is nice to play while waiting for someone, or sitting in the doctors office waiting for his appearance.  The scissors cutting is rather annoying, though.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I LOVE this App. The camera has yet to fail me, and being able to take my Kindle and use Evernote ANYWHERE, even WITHOUT WiFi access, makes me love it more. The 'only' discord is that the ONLY way to share is to email. I have to be<br />using an APP &amp; open Evernote pictures to share on social network sites. KIKI B.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read this book thru the night!! Couldn't put it down. Keep me l laughing & thinking about exploring new sexual heights!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Hours of fun and good to keep the the old brain matter working.  Can be frustrating when you run out of life.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Interesting story and yet a little disturbing. Excellent cast. Jessica Lange is great in her role which is very complex.
1433502410|5.0|Love this bible. Got this to use teaching a class.  It's a little big to carry around but great for a home resource bible.  Shipped fast.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|good
B009LQKHIO|1.0|I could not get through this book.  Same old same old.  I would not read something from this author again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have to say I understand what all the talk was about.  I started watching this series to see what all the hype was about.  Once I started watching it was hook, line & sinker.  Perfectly written, well executed.  Worth all 3 days it took to watch all three seasons.  Can't wait til the 4th begins.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Great music.  Love it!  An oldie but a goodie.  Grand Funk Railroad was one of my favorites when I was growing up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't give this show enough stars!!!  From the 1st season to the 3rd!  The only downside is waiting for the 4th to begin!!!  Highly recommend!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This final episode is a long awaited great ending to a wonderful series. I wish that it could have lasted another hour.
B004GJYROG|4.0|My grand children love watching this one and request every time they come over to spend time with me. Wonderful humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love it I will recommended to everyone is so much fun. you learn and have fun at the same time
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|it's a pretty large file, but worth it. I'm a big fan of horror adventure type games. I'll have to check the others out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love it I will recommended to everyone is so much fun. you learn and have fun at the same time
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun. It's not too challenging, so you can play through without a walkthrough. Exploring each room and figuring out what to do is exciting.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I wanted to buy it because my nieces play it, but seems like the version I got is really slow. I mean, to load the app takes a few minutes.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I don't rate applications unless I'm unhappy. But this is a great app. Let's me listen to oldies, old-time radio programs and even some police scanners.<br />very easy interface, no learning curve.<br />Was a FAOTD, I am not sorry I downloaded this. Good job.Visual blasters.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game on my Kindle but could not figure out #10.  I tried finding the solution on cheat sites but &#34;this&#34; one game never came up. Since I couldn't find the solution and couldn't go any further I deleted it. I love the game but had to give up on it.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Excellent film, if you're willing to overlook the stark differences between the book (which is far superior) and the film adaptation.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome game having a great time in ponyville. Getting to play with all my favorite my little pony toons plus getting to know all the lesser character s too.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This has become my &quot;go to&quot; game when I just have a few minutes of extra time for a little diversion. It's a little challenging but not enough to .make it frustrating.. Just a nice, pleasant little puzzle.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon at her best drawing us along with Jamie and Claire on adventures from Scotland to Paris, the West Indies and beyond in the continuing Outlander series. A superb storyteller of characters you love to love and love to hate in a book you don't want to end. This series is the best I have ever read and enjoy reading again and again. I highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I am not the ideal audience.  I am not a young adult, but I want to see what all of the hype was about.  If this is your cup of tea, you may love this book.  It is easily digestable and very plot driven.  If you want fluff, this is a good choice.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Since I downloaded this without knowing much about it the story came as a surprise.  It's not a great book but a good one.  It kept me reading and involved.  It tackles a big subject (disability, the right to end you own life) with humor and intelligence.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This thing is cheaper than a Roku box, and finally I can get YouTube videos on my TV. The device has trouble with my router some days, but it works pretty good most of the time. It's easy to set up, and sends a strong signal to my TV. I wish it was a little smaller so it didn't stick out from the side of my TV, but I imagine they will be building them into future televisions. I hope they add more functionality soon.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|This is an intelligent and finely-crafted novel from the gifted Tasmanian author. Engaging and absorbing to read and therefore highly recommended.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|What a treat! This was an empathetic(ironic in the circumstances!) and very amusing insight into the world and headspace of a man who is autistic or has asbergers. I laughed out loud and enjoyed his take on the so-called weird people and behaviours around him. Lovely. Highly recommended for an entertaining and light read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very much enjoyed reading the book. So much more in-depth than the movie (having seen it first) I would  absolutely recommend this  book.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I liked the price it was easy to attach to the stroller.  It holds just enough stuff that you may need to be convenient.  The quality is exceeded my expectations.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie. The only thing. Was when ordering it we started to order in HD until it said that it resolution could be adjusted to standard so we just ordered the standard version. Great Movie
B005C0DHEY|1.0|After following the concern of some environmentalist friends I investigated and watched Fracknation 1st to see what the reply to GasLand presented, then Gasland.  It is obvious that Josh Fox only wants to present a documentary which is NOT based on FACTS rather based on emotions to feed the followers of the agenda to NOT have the USA energy independent.  The same group the support banning the use of hydrofracking have no problem with the hauling of their chemical laced trash to be buried in the landfills several counties away from their locality, where the chemicals leach out of the landfill and into the aquifers.  .
B008469DGY|4.0|Good for a freebie. More like advanced putt putt than real golf. There is a big jump from 10,000 to advance to 30,000 about halfway through.
B00A285OOW|4.0|I liked it. Love the author, great seris on the cousins war. Can't wait for the next one! Loved the authors note
B0030IIYWA|1.0|How the heck does a brand new DVD skip???? So disappointed!!! Plus the DVD copy is incorrect....how the heck did a copy of ice age get placed in the case????? I will not buy from here again!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great game, to me better than the original angry birds but then, I love all of the angry birds sagas....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a Awesome app my son just loves this game and even got his mom addicted to it.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Writing and acting just doesn't get any better than this!  It will be sorely missed...hopefully something else will come along equally as good.
B00003CXQY|5.0|The Emperor's New Groove is one of our family's favorites. My husband and I bought it even before we had kids. Witty weird humor, with action and a great story about thinking about others, not just yourself.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Good movie with lots of twists.  Love how it all comes together.  Would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys being entertained without all of the drama.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A good sci-fi book. If you liked the hunger games series or the divergent series this is a good book for you
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|As other reviewers had mentioned, its extremely disappointing that someone at paramount has deemed it okay to NOT include the commentary ( which is specifically the special feature I enjoy the most ) on the bluray set.  I hope that paramount will not make this mistake a trend on future releases as its a disservice to those who pay a premium to enjoy the high quality disc releases over the lower bitrate streams.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|excellent news aggregator. This is a really wonderful app.EQUALLY AS good.as Feed Demon used to be for the PC. For those who love the news, get this app.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Easily one of my favorite books. While this book can be predictable, it provides spectacular entertainment and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat.
0857868764|3.0|An interesting look at what it means to be human from the point of view of an alien.<br />He (of no name) is sent down to Earth to sabotage the work of Andrew Martin, a Cambridge Professor who has just discovered the key to the Reimann hypothesis, a mathematical solution to the relationship between prime numbers that has the potential to take our civilization into the next phase of evolution,\\"the big stuff; synchronization of brains, creation of free thinking computers, automation technology, intergalactic travel\\", and possibly immortality.<br />And here's the rub! Given the self-centered limits of the human brain, our idiotic closed-mindedness, intellectual laziness, moral ineptitude, predilection for violence, and overall inability to make any meaningful use of our own lives, do responsible aliens want us to be their neighbors? No way! Hence the intruder, who takes over the body of of our former professor (we never actually discover how he was eliminated...) in order to eradicate all remaining evidence of the great scientific breakthrough.<br />In doing so the alien has to walk in the professor's shoes, befriend his friends, sneak sex with his student plaything, contend with the fragile psyche of his sixteen year old son, Gulliver, and go home each night to share his bed with his long-suffering but attractive and intelligent wife, Isobel.<br />At the start the book paces well, the alien discovering how repugnant humans can be, with their manias, their inconsistencies, their foibles and paradoxes. None of this is earth shattering news to us readers, but seeing the evidence pile up in this way is addictive, amusing in some masochistic way, and so we keep turning the pages.<br />There comes a point at which the alien begins to turn; like some inverse function of the Stockholm Syndrome the assassin begins to identify with his victims. It is our love of art and music, poetry, the little kindnesses we sometimes render to each other, and our infrequent flashes of courage, that eventually turns his head. (Not to mention crunchy wholenut peanut butter, and the loyalty of our pets.)<br />Unfortunately, once the alien decides he prefers humanity, all the excitement seems to grind to a halt. Everyone goes back to the drudgery of life as we mortals know it: to be rescued in the end only by love.<br />For the reader it's amusing to re-discover how silly we really can be, and there are aspects of this novel that are endearing, the self-sacrifice of a mother who gives up all for her family, the fragility of a teenage mind that parents can never understand. But the book on the whole is not exactly a heavyweight, more of a silly and entertaining romp, a pleasant diversion to enjoy on a hot sluggish weekend, maybe a frozen yoghurt without a cherry on top!, that eventually turns his head.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. I read it while recovering from an illness (major to me, minor in comparison) and it was what I needed. Beautiful tale, so heartbreaking...in a good way.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|This was very funny movie...  I really liked Sacha Baron's character...  however, I don't think I'd let really young kids watch.  IMO, some of the themes were defn young adult not for your children.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Classic. I love the fact that my kids love this movie too. It is a great film, kids love. Thanks for making it Prime!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Speeds up my charging without a doubt! I recommend it for anyone who buys a Nexus 10 but for the price of a Nexus 10 it should come with one automatically.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Can't be beat.  Stores well in my Kindle case, and saves this fat-fingered person much aggravation.  Keeps the screen cleaner, too.  I'm hoping for durability, as this item is pricey compared to rather a lot of others out there.  But, it's *better* as well, and hopefully its useful life will reflect that.  I've not found another I like better.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|my kids love puzzles andit's good for problem solving. levels get harder and harder as they go up. can't wait for the next one.
B0059M7YF8|4.0|10 INPUT &#34;DID YOU LIKE OXYGENE? [Y/N]&#34;;A$<br />20 IF A$=&#34;Y&#34; THEN PRINT &#34;THEN BUY THIS RECORD!&#34;:END<br />30 PRINT &#34;DON'T BUY THIS RECORD.&#34;:END<br /><br />Don't forget to save to tape when finished typing this in.<br /><br />But seriously, folks; this is pretty much a straightforward continuation of what Oxygene did, except that Jarre's &#34;cycle of life&#34; theme shines more strongly through this album than whatever concept he had in Oxygene.  I love them both, myself, Oxygene maybe a little more.  For those unfamiliar with Jarre's early output: remember all that cheezy synthesizer in crappy 80's action/horror movies?  Well, it was very likely that music was inspired by/ripped off from either Jarre, Tangerine Dream, or Vangelis, none of whom are cheezy and/or crappy.  Vintage analog (!) synth music by someone who understood hooks and theme are still important in experiment music (even if he occasionally lost his way in both albums).
B00BEIYM42|5.0|UNFINISHED SONG is a beautifully executed, British-made film that will make you cry.  Though it deals with death and loss, writer/director Paul Andrew Williams' film ultimately celebrates life.<br /><br />Arthur (Terence Stamp) and Marion (Vanessa Redgrave) have been married \\"forever\\".  They are total opposites.  He's an old grouch, devoted to her, but who is practically estranged from his grown son (Christopher Eccleston).  She, on the other hand, has a warm, outgoing personality.  Sadly, her doctor has told her that she only has a few weeks to live.<br /><br />Marion is a member of a spirited local singing group for senior citizens, led by Elizabeth (Gemma Arterton), a young and charming music teacher.  Arthur wants nothing to do with the aging choir, but he aids his wife's participation in order to placate her.  Then, she passes away...and all he has is Elizabeth's friendship and the choir.<br /><br />The actors in this touching drama are uniformly magnificent.<br /><br />The DVD, released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, contains several deleted scenes and outtakes.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B00DU16OJM|5.0|Guy Clark is a song writer that all other song writers should strive to be like. Simply amazed again by yet another masterpiece.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series! Great plot, characters, and set design. Downton draws you in and holds tight! Can't wait until the next season.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The author is good at describing the characters and the scenes so that you can picture it all.  The story of magic, strength, courage and adventure is great for both kids and adults.
B009YMYGWI|4.0|It's not as much crazy action as the previous Die Hard's, but I think that makes it a bit more relevant to the current times.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This is the best barbeque accessory I have ever bought! I would spend an hour trying to light and tend to my charcoal to make sure it was burning. This starter made it so simple and without lighter fluid!!!! My food tastes better and I can now focus on side dishes instead of my charcoal.
0670026638|4.0|I really enjoyed this complicated and unusual novel, although I don't think it's a book that everyone would like. My favorite chapters were those written by Nao in her journal, although it took a while to get used to the teenage girl writing style. Her life in Japan was very depressing, but she managed to write about bullying, suicide, neglect and prostitution with a marked lack of self-pity and at times a comic attitude. It was fascinating to learn about Japanese pop culture through Nao's eyes. Her communications with Jiko, her feminist Zen Buddhist priest great-grandmother, were my favorite parts of the book. Ruth's life, on the other hand, was much more ordinary and full of common everyday details, although the glimpses of life on a tiny and wild Canadian island were also interesting. I particularly enjoyed (but was confused by) how these two characters' dramatically different lives were tied together towards the end of the novel.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|My husband and I had started watching this series, but he goofed and didn't set for a couple, so we missed them and I was bummed! Then I thought of Amazon Video on Demand and checked it out. Sure enough - they were offered there, so I ordered the two episodes we missed and were able to catch up without missing a beat.  This service is a godsend!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This a great series! Love the plot, characters, and set design. The series draws you in and holds on tight!
B000KX0IOA|4.0|The movie starts in South Africa in the year 1893 where Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a London educated lawyer is coming to help with the South African Indians in their quest for equality.  He soon learns that him and his people are treated as third class citizens and must abide by laws that no one else must follow.  He empowered the Indian Hindus and Muslims to follow him and through non-violence march in protest against the British government's unjust laws against the Hindu's and Muslim Indians.  He eventually got the British government to make changes due to his non-violent movement.  The movie than takes you to the year 1915 where Gandhi arrives back in India where he starts his non-violent slow escalated movements to  gain Indian rights from the British government.  He is jailed on several occasions for sedition and even spent up to two years in prison.  Gandhi travels all over India advocating a non-violent and non-cooperation movement that helped united Hindu's and Muslim's together in seeking independence  for India.  He pushed for a boycott of non-Indian produced goods and protested against a salt tax.  In 1947 Gandhi's continued non-violent movement helped alter the minds of the British government and India was given its independence.  This great movie showed who Gandhi was over a 54 year period and how he shaped the future of India and showed the world the birth of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />How movie relates to World Religion Class: Gandhi was able to use the common goal of India's independence to unite both Hindu's and Muslims.  He found inspiration from reading the Koran even though he was born and raised as a Hindu.  He truly believed all people were good and some are just misguided and needed direction or motivation to change.  This is a must see movie that will show you how one person can and did make a difference for nearly one billion people.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever u need to get it I love this game because u can do all kinds of stuff on here and u will be stuck forever.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is a fine story about a young school boy, Marcus, who needs some support in his life, and Will, a rich Londoner who wants no responsibilities (played masterfully by Hugh Grant).  Marcus's single mother is suicidal, and he is constantly harassed at school for being far fr This is one of those comedies that is not only funny but makes a good point: people need other people, and life is much more satisfying when you have some sort of family.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has lots of action and has good graphics.  My grandson loves to play it and that says a lot.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel is well-written and the first half is gripping and involving. The use of multiple narrators becomes tiring, however, and by the end I found I was just tired of the characters and felt they deserved each other.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was really touched by the interwoven stories and how it spans a lifetime. The sibling relationship is really heartbreaking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is remarkable. Beautifully well written so much I may read it over again. You fall in love with Augustus faster than Hazel Grace.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've used this program for years and really missed it on my Kindle.  No more!  Now I can do so much more with my Kindle, I couldn't be happier.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Baldacci is a great thriller writer. This book is so convoluted and full of plots that it gets  too complicated. Read it fast if you want to keep up with it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has lots of action and has good graphics.  My grandson loves to play it and that says a lot.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|ChromeCast does not cast from Chrome on an iPad.  It does show Netflix and Youtube.  That's it.  Completely misleading name and advertising.  Waste of time and money.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Awesome series, addictive drama, a lot of liberties with historical facts but hey !  Its Show time not discovery channel.
B00BPWDMP2|3.0|This is a decent CD from this group-expect more of the same. Goodbye Town and Downtown are great leadoff singles featuring terrific vocals. All the songs are great. I guarantee that you will like this-don't expect too much, sit back and relax, and you won't be disappointed!
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|I admit I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but just watching a few scenes from this 4K master and the previous Blu-ray release, I am struggling to see a difference. I'm watching it on my 65&#34; Panasonic plasma, so the better the HD transfer, the better. And my Blu-ray player is the PS3 with the latest firmware updates.<br /><br />These are not 4K discs, they're just mastered from the highest quality of the transfer available. There are no special features on the disc so that it allows more room for a higher bit rate version of the film, with less compression. Everything about this release is identical to the wide release of the Blu-ray except that the special features option is absent from the menus.<br /><br />This is my favorite film, so I'll buy every version that is produced, but I would advise you to save your money on this one. Unless I just have something not setup correctly on my systems, I am seeing absolutely no difference at all.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game has lots of action and has good graphics.  My grandson loves to play it and that says a lot.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|It's a little slow in many parts, and not necessarily in a good way, but overall I liked the story and the look of the film.  Though, you certainly have to suspend quite a lot of disbelief to accept the reality of the two world juxtaposed above each other.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book kept my attention from the time I started til the end and I plan to read it again. (Actually I had 90% of it read to me out loud using Kindle on my iPad and iPhone)  This book is exciting, and it appears that I've already had a great healing from it, using only exercise one! Wow! Exercise one, I asked for a blessing to be shown to me within 48 hours, and two of my previously chronic physical problems have ceased to hurt !<br /><br />Just when I was on the edge of my chair excited to try out each logical thought process, the author would throw in some clever humor on top of it all, and give<br />me a chuckle. I think if we knew each other in person we'd be good friends.<br /><br />Within an hour of finishing this book (the first time, this morning) I promptly gifted it to both of my grown children.... the first time I ever have done that too.<br /><br />I see that some people gave reviews saying they didn't get much from the book. I think I must have been 100% ready for it because it I thought it was really really awesome!<br /><br />Thank you for being inspired to write this Pam!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you like historical romances this one rates high, along with Jane Austen's works. Thornton and Margaret make a good contrast of personalities.
B007HO392S|4.0|This is quite possibly her best yet! No one can do these songs like Carrie Underwood. Good Girl was a good leadoff song to this album, while Cupid's Got a Shotgun was a good song. You will love Two Black Cadillacs. Guaranteed. See you Again-great ballad. If you like Carrie and her music-you gotta get this album! It features ballads, infidelity songs, story songs-anything a Carrie (or country) fan could ask for. She has the perfect pipes for it too.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|If you have a HP wireless printer, this works GREAT. Love it. Allows you to print from your Kindle from anywhere. Well that is if your connected to a wi-fi. It's not magic.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This movie has a good story and you will probably enjoy it.  There are twists and turns you might not expect.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I recommend this amazing film, you are going to love the story. &#34;The Intouchables&#34; was one of the best movies I've seen in my life.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|An interesting recording with lots of pleasant surprises.  Nice change of pace for those times when the music is the key to the mood.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another awesome season with more plot turns than I would have liked. More surprises, love, and betrayal. Can't we just all get along?
B000TETLPC|4.0|Maynard's vocals are always spot on.. bought this entire album just for the song &#34;pet&#34; but ended up enjoying pretty much every song.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Guess I really just didn't like the interface. Nothing inperticular, just didn't like it. Pluse if I want to edit photos, that's why I have a desktop computer. Try it, it's free, you may like it.
B00006RAKP|4.0|If you are an Elton John fan, this album is a must have. It incorporates all of his greatest hits from 1970 through 2002. It is a must have for all Elton John fan's.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|Love the movie - my all time favorite.  Funny, emotional, visually appealing.  There is no dog quite like Dug anywhere.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|kids love it. need more levels but the difficulty is good for all age groups. we play all the time
B00C8985DU|5.0|This has got everything you would want in a special reissue package and more.  The DVD is wonderful.  The music sounds better than ever and the packaging is spectacular.  My only criticisim:  the &#34;Ocean&#34; drawings.  Not very good and a useless part of the box set.  Would have been better to leave it out and charge less.  Otherwise, excellent!  Buy it!!
B00DM0UTPQ|5.0|Ed Harris and Duchovny a great pair to bounce dialogue off in a tight environment like a soviet sub. Very intense movies well worth watching.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show and season. Can't wait for season 3 to see how things evolve with Mike, Harvey and the crew
B004HWYTP4|5.0|My husband  and I really liked this movie, lots of action and funny in some places as well.  Great actors and good story line. We would watch this again. Great rent price too.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I need this app because I have to sing solo at my church sometimes and it helps me to start out correctly.
140006922X|3.0|It seems the author can't get beyond his Islamic roots.  He spends many pages exploring all the non-scriptural<br />myths/rumors/stories I've heard all my life and down-putting minor details of the Gospels.  He included 66 pages<br />of &#34;Notes&#34; & &#34;Bibliography&#34; without exactly identifying where he got his conclusions.  It was an interesting read,<br />but he didn't convince me or change my mind.
B009186JYI|2.0|Classic documentary of the early Stones.  A great watch...once.  Too many viewings will reveal that fact that the live audio and the live video are probably from different sources and maybe different shows.  Reissuing something like this is only worth it if you can add LOTS of &#34;real&#34; performance footage.  The bits that were added are suspect in my book.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|this movie was soooo good. I have bought a lot this year and this is in the top 10 to 15 movies for me. well worth the power to run the tv.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has sci-to and 80's trivia to the max. Well-written, intelligent, multi-dimensional characters make this book worth<br /> reading. Easily one of my favorites.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have 3 Apple TV and I like it but when I bought Google chromecast  I love it!!!  It is not only cheaper but it also working better.  You can use with your laptop and all smart phones.  But we have to wait for more apps such as Hulu Plus to be available on Google Chromecast.  I bought 3 more of Google Chormcast for my relative and will plan to by the other 3 more for my best friends.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|A group of poor retirees relocate to India and find themselves in a less than luxurious &#34;resort&#34;, intending to retire in this inexpensive country.  Maggie Smith and Judy Dench make you believe this could really work.  Watching all the characters learn how to behave and survive in an unfamiliar world is believable, and gives us all the experience of India's crowded streets and people on the move.  I especially wanted to see this movie because seeing &#34;A Passage to India&#34; in the 80s gave me a lifelong appreciation for the beautiful areas of India that Americans seldom see.  The &#34;Marigold Hotel&#34; only shows today's city life, but I felt like it was a true representation.  This movie would probably appeal more to those over  40 and mostly to the over 55 population.
1936608898|5.0|People would feel better and not complain about basic health complaints if they got on board w this lifestyle. Try it!
068981528X|5.0|Many many years ago I read this over and over to my daughter until she was old enough to read it to me.  We thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Recently I went looking for it and could not find it so I ordered 2 copies - one for the 'save' box in the basement and one I sent to her in TN.  She was so surprised and it brought back such happy memories.
B006OV7RQ4|5.0|I disagree with some other commenters on here who are not satisfied with unanswered questions and wants a happily ever after happy ending.  That was not the intent of the director or the actors.<br /><br />The story line is all too accurately portraying the bizarre behaviors of cult members and how effectively they win over their converts over time.  Most cult members are victims of what is called the<br />\\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" where the new members become converts and buy into the craziness and identify with their captors.<br /><br />All too often, the cult leader rapes new women into the fold and these women after a time give in willingly.  This was illustrated all to well with the cult member waking up our heroine out of sound sleep already having entered her (and it is suggested that he took her virginity)and he has not bothered with even a semblance of foreplay.  He enters her from behind and she is indicating pain and tries to get up and he simply pins her to the floor by laying on top of her and quickly finishing.  It is the next day and one of the crazy girls goes rapturously about how beautiful it is to be taken for the first time by the cult leader.<br /><br />The women all reinforce peer pressure and make the most bizarre things seem normal like killing an innocent man whose house they have broken into.<br /><br />Marcy tries to escape to normalcy but she has not been de-programmed which is almost always necessary for former cult members.  They have to be reintroduced to the real world because the cult has been their reality.  Marcy's sister and her husband of course are not up to the task and correctly try to get help for the sister and this is where the movie ends with one of the cult members following them in another car and you are left to your own ending to create in your mind.<br /><br />It is a brilliant character study. Not for teens or younger.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This was a nice weekend book for me. My high school children had already read it and I was catching up.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I truly enjoy this series,it takes fairy tales and makes it real and fun! The cast is wonderful and always amazes me to see how they interact with<br />each other and the storylines. I love it!!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|A retirement home for accomplished musicians is not a setting with which most of us are familiar.  I appreciated being introduced to the possibilities of their autumn/winter years.  The home and grounds were beautiful, the background music was lovely and usually familiar, and I thought the characters were very believable considering their fame and their talents.  I especially loved Pauline Collins' adorable character, and I couldn't stop thinking that Tom Courtenay played Pasha in Dr. Zhivago (in the 60s) - great then and now.  In my opinion, this movie would not appeal to the majority.  Interests would include:  classical music lovers, serious love stories, retirees, and serious musicians.  It would only appeal to the younger generations who themselves prefer classical music and serious themes.
1451695195|5.0|It was unique from other NDE's because he was a non believing scientist and his cortex was completely shut down.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Loved the books...loved the movies when they came out...now they are all mine!  Great viewing quality.  Enjoying the special features.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Saxon just keeps putting out solid metal albums, I wish newer metal bands would start to take notice, and realize why bands like Saxon are still around after 35 years.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|So much current detail, and realistic action. At times made me hate the Chinese for killing Americans for no real reason. To think Reagan called Russia \\"the evil empire\\" when the Chinese are so much worse and will stop at nothing.<br /><br />Great read and hard to put down.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best shows ever created. Season two is not my favorite, as it is slower. It does a wonderful job depicting the war and how it affected everyone.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a really good read. Now not just for the sexual purposes, but the story that goes along with it is excellent. The ending of this book leaves you wanting more like this can't just be the end right? Thank goodness for the trilogy lol I would be devastated. E.L. James. Props to you sister. Excellent work. Can't wait for the movie coming out next year!
B000E5N6LG|5.0|This is the best western since Red River. The acting is superb.  The directing is superb.  The American western as the American epic or mythos has come of age. Congratulations to all
B00DRGQHXS|5.0|Fantastic! Great Album! The song writing is excellent, cool, soulful. Vocals are flawless. JOE is one of the few artists which can be relied upon to still produce quality song lists that have a long lasting playability!!! It's a must buy. Awesome!!!<br />  J.K.Lord
B00B769XB8|5.0|Bought this before seeing is because Jeremy Renner is sex on legs. Found this movie to have great action, humor came at the right spots, the 3D worked amazingly well and there was a lot of it too, not the crap that we see in other 3D movies where you see something 3D every half hour. Can't wait for the sequel.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Hilarious and original I can't get enough!!! Can't wait for the next season to come out on tv in September
B00BR0SGN0|4.0|great musicians with steve morse, roger glover, etc. but not as hard hitting as i thought it would be. great in person, if you like the hard hitting music and tremendous guitar work of morse. he can play anything and everything.
B005ONTD42|2.0|I bought one of these and found that it will only move on hard surfaces. It will not roll in grass or on dirt at all. It is underpowered and hard to maneuver. The apps are kind of boring as well. The one I got seems to have been used although sold as new, the seals on the box were broken upon arrival, however I paid full price. I would not recommend this as it is over priced and definitely not worth the asking price. I returned it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Despite the fact that all the characters were unlikeable this was enjoyable. Fast paced, lots of action and yet it had a plot, unlike most movies these days.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good ending to the series. Surprises at most corners. No fluff and an amazing analysis of human nature, spirit, and habits. What does ever truly, collectively learn from our past?

B008HK3XKO|5.0|I bought this for my older cousin who just received their Kindle as a gift and it works just right for them. I have bought several of the covers for my different Kindle's. I would recommend buying a cover for your e-books.
B005LAII80|5.0|Everything about Dredd was brilliant, from Karl Urban's acting to the choreographed violence. The slo mo scenes were fantastic as was Lena Headey's performance as Ma Ma. If there ever was a movie that deserved a sequel, it's Dredd.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is the best game in the whole world I play it a lot it is hard to unlock everything
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Everything was in good condition. The cover was a little dented but the discs were great and had no scratches.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Chromecast has very limited play-back capabilities. Although youtube, netflix and google play work fine, the picture quality in google Chrome browser cast still needs major improvements.<br /><br />Also, it would be best served if I could cast videos from other providers like Dailymotion, vimeo etc. If these video providers come on board soon, I will be more than happy to give it 4 stars. But in its current state, 3 stars is appropriate.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's a great app and it's highly recommended. Best thing is its learns by itself about ur typing pattern and adjusts accordingly. Super fast typing.

B001K3JF7K|5.0|I love anything by Diana Krall.  This is no exception!  Beautiful as usual!  Great songs and beautiful album!  Take a listen.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This series never fails. Season 10 is so good. The story lines are so good; the actors were superb with their acting and directing is top notch. Jimmy and Ducky are funny together. I love all the cast members. I love their camaraderie and the love they have for each other. They treat each other with respect and like a family. All of the episodes have funny scenes in them and a few brought tears to my eyes. All in all, it didn't disappoint. The money I paid for this series was so worth it. Looking forward to season 11.
0425252868|5.0|On the outside cover I thought very kool a german helps an American during the war, I want to read this.  IT is not like that.  It goes into what it is like to be German, and NOT a natzi.  Please get this book, I thought all germans in WWII were Hitler fans.  This coming from a person who traveled to Germany several times.
B00C6BACF4|5.0|Aside from the movie itself being a top-notch British zombie comedy, the steelbook is incredibly sleek and looks great on a Blu-ray shelf. And it was cheaper than the normal edition at my local video store! Thanks again, Amazon.

B000FC11A6|3.0|It's fine if you enjoy long periods of boredom punctuated by complex and unnecessarily wordy action sequences.  This book could be an excellent thriller, but its pace is way too slow and the multiple plot lines take far too long to intertwine: I might as well have been reading three completely different and separate books for the first two thirds of Cryptonomicon.  Overall, there were sequences that were very good, and it's very funny at times, but the good stuffed sprinkled so loosely throughout an immense tome of pure boredom that I really can't recommend it at all.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|Surprised at how much I love this. Every part. The vocals are delicious and so are the guitar riffs, the beat, Avicii's signature behind it. Great collaboration. First EDM track I've ever really liked.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I loved the initial Pine/Quinto ST effort, and this one is not too far off the quality of that effort. I still think Wrath Of Khan is the best Trek film to date, mainly due to the rich Corinthian leather (smile if you remember those '70s ads!), but STID is a very respectable entry into the ever-expanding Trek universe.<br /><br />Pine and Quinto make a great pair, and Urban and Pegg's silliness works pretty well. The Vulcan love subplot is a tad goofy and unreal but then so is everything in the Trekverse, so why worry? The script has some good laughs, some solid action, and a few interesting concepts, though I for one would like more of the latter next time out. It's the mind-bending ideas that made the best Trek episodes work, and Abrams should seek to get more of them in next time around. This world is so rich in possibility it seems a shame not to play that side of it to the hilt.<br /><br />As for the ripoff marketing of this film, all I can say is we'll keep getting more and more of that as long as we put up with it, so stand up and simply DON'T BUY ANY OF IT! They only do it because they know so many Trekkies are serious collectors. If you don't buy all their versions maybe they'll get the message.<br /><br />Or just do what we do and rent these for half a buck at your local rental box with a monthly membership, or one night rental for a buck at the kiosk. That's all the cash they'll get from me!<br /><br />All in all, this is a good Trek entry and this cast looks set to give us quite a good run of fun films. I think Roddenberry would be pleased with how Abrams is doing so far.
0553573411|5.0|This book is a good follow up in the series and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  I hope the other trilogy I got from Robin Hobb is also as good.
1451695195|5.0|I was informed of the book by the author's sister and recall her stories on his path in life. What an inspiration for those needing their faith reaffirmed. You will be pleasantly rewarded by this book.
B005544V6A|5.0|Interesting take on how lawyers work behind the scenes.  The show actually portrays lawyers in a positive sense even though the premise of the show is based on the main character is operating as a lawyer illegally.  Cool twists and characters are OK.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I was hooked from episode one. Glee inspired me to write songs agian. I absolutely loved it. Best show ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Predictable at times, however, interesting drama that unfolds fr the family & their staff.  Ready for season 4 in january

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I like the idea of the cover, but the stand would sometimes not stay in place and fall. Other than that very nice cover

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett is a great storyteller, as always, but I didn't like the second book as much as the first, Fall of Giants. I'm hoping the final installment in the trilogy will take my breath away. Winter of the World is like the second act of a play where the story moves forward. There are SO many characters to keep track of as new people join the family stories. Definitely worth reading, and I can't wait for the final book!
B00005AFVR|4.0|Great CD.  I bought this CD and Hammersmith Odeon, London '75.  This is a great CD but if you are looking for a live CD, I would purchase the Hammersmith, Odeon, London '75.  Although both CD's are well worth the money....

0679746048|5.0|For anyone looking to view the insides of the workings of psychology and mental hospitals, in the '60s, this book is perfect.  Ms. Kaysan draws a wonderful, and very personal picture, of her life inside the institute over 18 months, and her recovery, and life after leaving, being declared recovered.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This was a must have.  I would gladly spend the money on the next season when it comes out on DVD!
0061650994|5.0|We bought this book for a six yaer old grandson. We are going to the play and wanted him to be aware of the story.  THis book is excellent!  It has great picturess and is short enough to read in one sitting.  The font size was quite good not too big not too small.<br /><br />A great book for a 6 yr old.  Probably 5 to 9 would also like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you may have figured it out, the book turns completely upside down... and you never saw it coming....it's great!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|My girlfriend told me about Lana Del Ray and listening to Born to Die, I was under her spell! I like the way she plays with her voice and creates her own beats and just goes with it. She sets a mood with each song and her lyrics usually tell a story. Don't let her live performances turn you away from this amazing artist.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Quickly and very addicting. Didn't intend to play it right away and found myself engulfed for quite a while and look forward to playing it now.

B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Excellent purchase from Canada.  Complete French Music Album.  Album comes with a mini calendar.  Celine Dion international flare resonates clearly.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Loved this movie.  In todays mixed up, messed up world, it was encouranging to believe that if people work together that they can achieve the \\"impossible\\".  Feel good movie.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This film is humbling, admirable.. The world's economy would be incredible if most people worked like Jiro-san, his sons, and staff. I would say this movie is 40% about sushi and 60% about working diligently and always striving for higher.<br /><br />Besides being an adorable, humorous old man, his work ethic and thoughtfulness is beyond rare in this day and age. I would jump at the chance to experience a master sushi chef and staff turn top-quality seafood into edible art
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This was a must have.  I would gladly spend the money on the next season when it comes out on DVD!
B00DHRLK84|3.0|As a stand-alone movie, it's kind of fun to watch, but if you've read the book, DO NOT EXPECT MUCH FROM THIS FILM.  Even the zombies are different.  No real background, the standard \\"Oh, it's a disease\\" plot, an eleven-second infection time.  Very dissapointing that the screenwriters couldn't read the book.
B000FC0SIM|4.0|The first half was entertaining, but it felt like he was procrastinating. Once he got into the stuff about writing, I couldn't get enough.  Practical examples helped me to understand his point. If you want to write well, this is a must read. But remember, this is Stephen King and not John Steinbeck. He talks about his type of writing. You will find all sorts of adverbs in Steinbeck, but he is not trying to scare the wits out of you.  Good job Stephen King, and keep those books coming!
0345530578|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet but it's hard to put down.  I can't wait to read the rest.  Awesome story!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is a lot of fun with several moments and lines you probably won't catch the first time around. I can watch this over and over and never get tired of it.
B0073HHV96|4.0|I read The Woman in White before discovering this work and his style is consistent.  Wonderful characters, rich scenery and plenty of intrigue!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This purchase was worth it.  I have enjoyed my purchase and would recommend this to others that share in this interest.
B000RLH2VM|5.0|Good cast, you can watch this movie over again and the leading characters get richer.  With that said, DeNiro and Reno steal the show.  Jonathan Pryce makes a terrific evil-doer. View this movie today, you will be glad you did.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I absolutely love this book I used to read it to the kids at daycare and I had to add to my collection if you are a parent or grand parent you'll love this book it is about the unconditional love of a mother to child and child to mother
B0014BY72Q|4.0|As a teenager I was shocked by the difference between the book & movie versions of &#34;Logan's Run&#34;. The book is violent and a bit pornographic while the movie is far more enjoyable.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|If you're a guy, this movie has it all! Action, great special effects, cool story line and of course, babes!
0345528581|5.0|Being one of its kind, You are your own gym is a book written by an actual military person. if you really want a reliable guide that is written by a person who has applied all the techniques he talks of in his own life then this is the one. The book is basically a compilation of bodyweight workouts that are usually done by military people in order to build up strength, muscle mass and endurance. Believe it or not, if you really want to go for some challenging workouts then try out some in this book. You don’t necessarily have to go to the gym for it. You can do the workouts in your yard or at home.<br /><br />Mark has prepared thousands of soldiers to get fit for the military and so he can help you out too. That’s probably what caught my eye. It’s a real person talking through his experience and achievements!<br /><br />Now, let’s get to what’s inside You are your own gym. The book has workouts and exercises that even a beginner can perform. Each exercise is described in detail with pictures and instructions. What I like most about it is that Mark has also listed the different types of combination (sets and reps) you can use which include the ladders, interval sets, tabatas and the like. He goes in details and talks about what method should be used with what exercises. Also, the workout itself goes from high to low and then back to high in intensity giving your body a total workout. Heard about the P90X? This book is something similar to that.<br /><br />You are your own gym has over a whopping 100 bodyweight exercises such as bodyweight rows, bodyweight squats, push up variations, pull up and pull down variations and a lot more. What I like the most about You are your own gym is that Mark has explained in detail how you can design your own workout plan. You don’t have to stick with Mark’s plan. You can design your own with the exercises mentioned in You are your own gym.<br /><br />Should You Invest in You Are Your Own Gym?<br /><br />Well, People whoare looking forward to home workouts should definitely buy this book. Also, those who don’t want to use barbells and dumbbells and stick to bodyweight exercises can also opt for this one. To sum it up, this is an exceptional book with exceptional bodyweight workout routines. Most of the exercises are quite challenging and they are very effective in getting you the desired results. If you still doubt it my advice is to try it out yourself just remember You are your own gym suits all shapes and sizes.<br /><br />Not only is this a great workout book, but shows you over 100 exercies that can be done anywhere, and it will save you ton's of $$$$ in gym memberships & equipment. In addition Mark offers the workout apps for $3.99<br /><br />My recommendation is......Buy It!......  It's the only book you'll ever need......period!<br /><br />MJ

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I like how this is the beginning of the 7 demigod prophecy. Rick Riordan does a great job in creating these new characters and still bringing in the known ones.
0143122061|5.0|Niall Ferguson, British historian and Harvard professor is one of the brightest people living on earth.  No summary review can do this book or this author justice.  If nothing else, read the book for the “six killer apps” as testament to the good decisions the US and the West has made and the risk of losing our economic freedom and prosperity.

B003JHKORK|5.0|Veers off from the book a little but still very nice job. I highly recommend this movie. Can't wait until Amazon comes out with the Sea of Monsters!
B006W0QR1S|4.0|There is almost no dialogue with Gosling's character, and only Ryan can pull that off. Gosling's acting, as usual, was outstanding.  The movie holds your interest and there is strong character development.  Although there are some violent scenes, this movie will appeal to women as well.  There is a certain sensitivity to Gosling's character which just makes him really likeable.  Outstanding score....enjoyed the quirky 80's sound and loved the song \\"Real Hero\\".
B000MCIBB6|4.0|Do you think I have time for this.  Interesting. See you.  Amazon has a lot of hutzpah.<br />La La La

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am normally not the type of TV viewer who goes in for poofy British dramas about snobby, erudite men who can't dress themselves, but still wear tails every time they sit down to dinner. But for some reason this show has drawn me in. I have grown to know the characters and genuinely care about what happens to them from episode to episode. And there is no shortage of sub-plots and twists to keep me interested. For a guy whose favorite shows are Rescue Me, Breaking Bad, and Sons of Anarchy, I have been surprised at how much I have enjoyed all three seasons of Downton and I am looking forward to the fourth season with great anticipation.

B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Great movie! Incredible special effects with a good story to back it up. I dislike that the only have &#34;Duke&#34; for the beginning but still a nice second movie of G.I Joe. I hope they come out with a third.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this as a FAOTD, but I would purchase now that I've played.  Wonderful game, beautiful music, helps wake up your brain to get a perfect score and find the hidden gem in each level! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzles!

B00CATSONE|5.0|This is a great book to read if you are on the journey to discovering greatness. This book gives you glimpses into the working patterns and habits of geniuses1
B008469DGY|3.0|This is a great game, but it takes away from the enjoyment when you have to swipe the screen just to get your ball where you want it to go once you flick it off the tee.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 3yr old absolutely loves this game!  It is similar to temple run, but much more fun for a younger child.  Just make sure you have your kindle set up so that your children cannot make accidental purchases as it is easy to do (as with most games).
140006922X|5.0|This book is very good. Whether you are a Christian or not you should read it. I bought it because of the Fox interview just to see what it was all about but I am very glad that I did.
1616550414|5.0|If you don't mind history, especially when it concerns fantasy universes then you will love Hyrule Historia. Why? Because the history of Hyrule mirrors that of the wheel of time universe, and even middle-earth, in at least several positive aspects. Not to mention that this book highlights the timelines of the games and books based off of Zelda, so that you know which game predated another in Hyrule's history timeline.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book really shows how the two camps have been intertwined even without them realizing it. Rick does a great job in showing the two sides of the Gods and how they have shaped the coarse of history/present. Astounding detail and a great way to lead up to &#34;The Mark of Athena&#34;
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|What a strange, wonderful fairy tale for adults! This brilliant story of a boy and this odd story of evil things and good things and oceans that aren't oceans and battles ..... Just magical.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|The app has an auto throttle and will not allow you to chose different. It takes away from the enjoyment of the racing.
B003R50FRI|5.0|I was totally swept up in this story - and even more into it because I live in Melbourne, where the author hails from. My parents remember the news coverage of his escape from prison here.<br /><br />A true writer, Gregory David Roberts' observations of the minutiae of life, as well as his ability to plot like a fiend make this one book I'll be getting, and recommending, to all.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Start Trek is a classic and this new series lives up to its names.  I hope there will be a star Trek 3 with the same characters.

B00280LYIM|5.0|Rick Riordan is now my favorite author of all time!!! Awesome book with great detail! I highly recommend all of his books.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I felt the book was rather confusing.  I took a while to understand who was who.  Do not think it was as good as his other two books.
B008EKMB82|4.0|Our Wisconsin book club chose this book because it was the \\"Big Read\\" for all students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the author will be speaking here in October. We have had a wonderful discussion concerning the layers of meaning and various symbolic intentions of the author. Some of our members purchased the book, while others read it on e-readers.  I purchased the kindle edition from Amazon and noted how important the footnotes are to understanding any of the book's references.  To my surprise I learned at our book club meeting that the book had an appendix which covered in-depth many topics touched on in the novel such as quantum mechanics, etc. The kindle edition from Amazon did not include this appendix; however, apparently if you purchased the book through I-books by Apple, the appendix was included.  I am reading on an I-pad and will consider buying these books from Apple to guarantee I receive the full book.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|I was motivated to read this one, because I am soon to be a grandfather, for the first time. Got to find stories, other than my own, to read and share with children. King Samuel Benson has brought some together in \\"Why Newly Born Babies Can't Talk... and other stories\\".  Such classic tales would be the learning foundations of the cultural heart of African people. Contemporized for our enjoyment, it proves  that every time and place has stories to share, with lessons, a sense of humour, and reflecting kindred hearts. It's worth reading and worth sharing.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|this game is awesome I would recommend this to my family and friends.  this game is very fun. for adults and children of all ages.
B003VW54QO|4.0|Always enjoy watching John Wayne movies.  This one is a real treat from years gone by.  Much of this movie was filmed in Old Tucson, Arizona which provides a great backdrop.  I enjoyed the scenery as much as the movie.  And Ricky Nelson (Colorado in the movie) looks about sixteen.  The movie plot is the good guys vs. the bad guys, and the good guys win.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|A solid 4 stars. A quick, engaging page turner. Was hard to put the book down once I started. Family dysfunction and secrets.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane did a wonderful job of setting the foundation of each character that I actually felt like I was sitting in their homes having tea!  This read gave me cause to think about what I would do if presented with the same situations and just how strong LOVE can be!  Thank you Liane for a wonderful read.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the book! Hosseini writes with such passion and opens up the human element and influences of another culture. With this experience, I feel like I have a better understanding of the Afgan culture and how the country's recent history has impacted it.
1576875776|5.0|Her work is really incredible. Definitely an art book worth owning if you're a lover of portraits or just NYC.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I bought two of these one for me one for my wife, I am stationed in Belgium and i have only had time to go out once but they do work and are very accurate in telling you if it is iron, nickle or other metals. So far I have found a TON of broken plows bits, and a gold wedding band (one of my friends buried it to play a prank on me) They are very fun to play with and a great way to pass time. They do work great but if you have them in close proximity with the sensitivity up they will act funny, so if you are close turn the sensitivity levels down, this may be a true statement with all detectors but I am a noob in this field.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George R.R.Martin is a genius!! I love this book! I'm looking forward to reading the second one. I enjoy this combination of all ingredients funny from time to time, very touching and a great dose of intrigues.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Somewhat predictable, but it was the best choice at the time.  The best thing about this is the monkey character.
B007704HO6|5.0|Absolutely delightful. Can't wait to read the sequel. Bob was definately a true healing force for James. I adored it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can go right to my Kindle HD and read my mail with no issues which is nice to have when you on the go.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is another movie I have had (on VCR) for years. It has been my favorite movie since I was a wee twerp. Now it is enshrined to last longer than me. I await with great anticipation to see the additional colorized version, and the special features. Kudos to Jimmy, and Donna
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Struggled to get into the story at first but the story unfolded and lives intertwined making an interesting read and twist in the story
B008AWBQGW|5.0|Easy to listen too, sounds good, couple songs I have never heard before. It is rare when I like a whole album. This one is good.
B00C2IN7EE|5.0|I love Robert Downey Movie's He seems to Reinvents his Characters.What i like Best about the Sherlock Series is how they go in Fight scenes with the main Character&#34;Robert Downey&#34; acting out in Slow motion His every move,before He fights.I think this is Brilliant.The Director of this Movie is a Genius.This Movie is well Laid out&a roll coaster of non stop action+the mastering of minds conflict between Sherlock&the villain is just Awesome.Best movie i have scene  all year.Buy this Movie.I am sure you will not be Disappointed..
B003K16P3M|4.0|Very captivating! When does the next one come out? The characters kept my attention throughout the whole book and I was sad to see it end.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|This was an awesome movie. for anyone who likes zombi/apocalypse movies, you will love this. i was laying in bed when i started it, and half way through i realized i was sitting at the edge of my bed and that's where i stayed. this is a zombi movie! so if you are the kind who likes to say its a bad movie because there is not enough character background or good relationships or whatever, just remember what you are watching. its not the notebook, its the zombi apocalypse here!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is great!  I love this.  It does every thing it says it would do.  I like that it has an elastic piece to keep it closed.
B00BTYU3SK|5.0|As wonderful as I remember. Watched it a lot when I was a kid so the movie has sentimental value to me as well. Bonus was that my kids enjoyed it too.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|my Kindle HD is so happy in its new case<br />thank you<br />great purchase<br />awesome price<br />love the color selections<br />really nice product<br />could sell more if they were twenty dollars though<br />if they were i would have gotten 3 of them

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Its a cool game and fun to play. I would recommend it. I am not very good at it yet but I keep trying.
1447231171|2.0|Plot is 100% obvious.  Poor boy suceeds despite all the bad guys.  Archer must need money!  Save yours. Not worth the time either.
B0017HEYEI|5.0|At first, I was upset, thinking I had accidently purchased a DVD that had only Korean audio. After finding the audio options, I saw that I could change the audio to English. Everything worked great, and the shipping was very fast! Thank you!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was written like none other - having &#34;death&#34; as the narrator - ingenious.  Although the subject matter was dark the narrator &#34;death&#34;  was compassionate, witty and even humorous while still being respectful to the seriousness of the book.  The format of each title page - again... ingenious.  It was so differently written - I absolutely loved it.  Wish more books were presented this way.
0140177396|5.0|Wanted this for my kid's library. You have to love Steinbeck, he knew how to write eloquently about the human condition.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|A great way to pass the time and can be challenging. Thanks for a fun way to keep busy keep it up
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I like what they have done to the franchise.<br />A nice and different twist, setting up for more to come.<br />I got the instant down load. Wanted it bought and in seconds watched it.
1451696191|5.0|The book came fast and I really enjoyed it. It's a very well written book and I feel like a lot of pre-teens that is moving to teenagehood should read it. It has some PG-13 scenes but overall a very cute and realistic book. Must read.
1595827684|5.0|I strongly recommend this book if you even have the older version of the Mass Effect Art Book. It is not only a nice edition and a well organized one, but also a very interesting art book, not just for fans, but for everyone interested in the process involved in the making of a videogame. The art is stunning, the cover and design is beautiful and the paper is appropiate for this kind of publications.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This show is the best one around. It is so entertaining. If you give it a try you won't be sorry!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|It was packaged to the best ability, and it provided what I wanted, but the product had a little more damage than was expected.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The seller was great- received this right away and in perfect condition. This was a gift and my son said thay couldn't stop watching. it so I guess my husband and I will watch it next.
B00A6VGLJM|5.0|So Mark Kermode, \\"Untouchable isn't going to be as big as The Artist\\" ? Yeah ?, No.  $350m to the Artist's paltry $133m<br /><br />Christ, I hope the Americans don't wreck this masterpiece with a follow up pile of poop.<br /><br />Maybe if they stuck Colin Firth as Philippe in the wheel chair and Leigh Francis as Driss making the stiff faced Firth poop his pants with laughter, then it might be some kind of comedy ?<br /><br />Well for the original, I enjoyed watching it four times over on Sky and bought the DVD shortly after, plus a few more copies to hand out for others to enjoy.<br /><br />It won't be long again I expect till I get a hankering for another viewing.<br /><br />As for those (very few) reviews for those less literate grumbling about the subtitles, I watched the film a few times over and still had not realised the film used subtitles, as I was so immersed.<br /><br />As for the Opera singer dressed as an overgrown bush, Driss certainly put things into perspective there, getting Philippe and the audience of the film into mild hysterics, (also in the birthday party scene, likening a certain bit of Classical music to the sound track of Tom and Jerry - now that was a classic !)<br /><br />10/10
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show!!  The characters are absolutely amazing!!!  Can't wait for season 4!!!  But how can they kill off Matthew?!?!?!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a really decent read. The twists and turns of the plot are stunning. I am awed by the deviousness of the characters.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Album of the year.These guys definetly stepped it up a notch.If your a real of these guys you will appreciate the hardwork.Theyve put on this album.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Lots of action, great storyline, great actors, great effects ... this movie is well worth watching!!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Best show in television history. Like nothing else--ever. Writers and actors are brilliant! Watching the last season now and am dreading the end.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|Love this movie... Just wish it didn't cut out some major scenes from the book!<br />Overall I was impressed by the acting skills. The screen is dark though, in some scenes it is hard to make out exactly what is happening.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|I've always been a fan of Peter Ustinov's portrayal of Poirot, and this is a good example of why. The direction, cinematography and acting are all top notch. Not to mention a great cast! An excellent companion to Ustinov's &#34;Evil Under the Sun&#34;. Like many other fans of Agatha Christie, I've come to think of David Suchet as the embodiment of Poirot, but a decade prior to Suchet it was Ustinov and he doesn't disappoint.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is awesome!! It has the weather it has 24 hour format and 12 hour format. It has 5 different types time telling settings. Overall this is an awesome app.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book from the moment I picked it up!  It's up and downs are fantastic and very well written. I didn't want it to end.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Excellent take on the short life of a hero. Excellent insider views and awesome footage of the world of F1 racing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My friends kept telling me I HAD to see this show... I wasn't thinking it would be very good but I am definitely HOOKED.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Very good music from the movie.  The song from the main theme singer is not on the CD but she wants too much for that one song on a single track CD.<br />Listen to this in the vehicle on the drive to and from the office.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|Very well written and compelling. Couldn't put the book down. Takes one through full range of emotions. Recommend for teens and adults.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|its a fun book,but written for very young readers.would like to read something a little more for the grownups,this kinda gets a little easy to guess whats going to happen.
B00C5R8364|2.0|A Bit of action in the begining but slowed down real fast. LIke watching DINNER WITH ANDRE. A lot of talking about nothing to fill the pages. I've read all of the Reacher stories and this one has to be the worst. Maybe the movie contract dehumbled the author. In any case I think Childs will have to rethink his story line and return to his roots if he wants to keep his audience. Get real Reacher knows about the minutest history of the opium dens in England and poets and thier history?  How convenient
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|When I just got this which was 9/17/13 I was just surprised and never thought this would happen by a gameloft app and surprisingly this says kindle fire edition and I'm using kindle fire and it kept closing every time it loaded I the farthest I got to do when just experience 4 seconds of one race and it completely closed and I had to keep 're loading it every time it closed then at one point I accendently clicked car packs and it froze my whole kindle I couldn't exit out so I just hit the power button then when I tried to hit it again to turn it back on ( not complete shut down) the screen was just all black and nothing happened I couldn't do anything I tried to completely shut down my kindle and I couldn't even see the shut down that you press on the screen because the screen was still black and I just keep holding the power button where I just got lucky enough to turn it off and yet this never happened to me even with a app that's not as famous or popular from gameloft ... and one other thing was from modern combat 4 it was making invisible space that wasn't even being used, so I deleted EVERY app I had on my kindle and yet It said I had only 10kb left..... after all this I feel kind of cautious from all the apps I download from gameloft....
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This app interfaces very nicely with the facebook game which I play as well. My children and I have a competition going on from week to week so I don't have to carry my laptop with me everywhere to stay in the competition.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. Its a lot of fun and it isn't too easy. I wish there were more levels though.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Great fun and enjoyable to play. I really liked it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys card games.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|Love this product. Increases camera battery time and adds weight to the camera making it more steady. A good addition
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I splurged and bought this movie after my son loaned it to me, for it is one I am sure I shall watch whenever I need a lift.
0762777931|5.0|What a fun book to read! Lots of good info that’s easy to understand delivered with a positive uplifting tone.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I think this app is awesome because they give you 2 emojies and they make a word just that you have to figure the  word out that's what I enjoy from this game
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I was interested until the secret was revealed too early in the book, and the end of the book came so abruptly that it was very anticlimactic.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Love all the different levels. The game is like solving puzzles - my kids love it too.  A real winner.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I got this movie on Netflix and knew as soon as I watched it that it was one I want to own.  Beautiful visually, moving, and thought-provoking with fine acting.  I expect to watch it with my grandchildren when the time comes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My husband had the demo on his phone and our daughter kept taking his phone to play it but would then get frustrated because nothing saved on the demo. This was the best, easiest, cheapest birthday present ever! She is 6 and plays it on her Nabi 2, this has kept her busy on long car rides and any other down time.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love it, it's just plain awesome and the movie was awesome no doubt about it. Any who hasn't tried it needs to try it.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I have used numerous game accessories for the World of Warcraft including Logitech's other offerings and this is the ONLY product that I continue to use and abuse mercilessly and it just keeps going.  I am particularly impressed by the little thumb joystick's durability.  I have caught myself many times pushing it to the point of literally giving myself a sore thumb and yet it still performs exactly the same as when I bought it several years ago.  I have cleaned months worth of debris out of the keys and shaken loose crumbs and hair and other unsightly things from the keys but the damn thing just keeps working.  The only down side I've ever had with it has more to do with Windows 7 than the controller. For some inscrutable reason sometimes the key mapped profiles don't load. I have to restart the machine (not such a big deal with a large SSD) and it will work as it always has.  It's biggest upside is it's amazing durability.  I only fear the day when it finally does die and I can't find a replacement.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a mixture between action, comedy, romance, Greek myths, and pure awesomeness! Has great plot, funny/cool characters, and is made by the best author ever! This book is very appropriate. Good for all ages. Just read the Percy Jackson series first. I can not wait for House of Hades!
B0096HK4WW|4.0|This low budget horror film was entertaining.  The special effects would be great for a haunted house at the mall, but were laughable on screen.  The actor's reactions and situations the characters engaged in throughout the film, and scenes in the morgue quickly moved past suspenseful, well written horror into outright ridiculousness, and I found myself laughing out loud several times.  I rated it 4 stars because it was so bad it was good. Had the producers intended it to be a dark comedy, they would have hit the genre on the head!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome . It is a mix of two of my favorite things.  Minions and temple run. Thank you gameloft for creating this. Such a five star game. And I don't rate five stars usually. But this game hits the spot! :)
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I tried this app from the &#34;free app of the day&#34; file on Kindle HD and its the BOMB. Then it took a bit to get thru the first couple of levels- meaning that they are challenging. Thouroughly enjoyable, fast paced once you get the hang of it. The game is a good zombie killer and along with mini zombies is one of my favorite apps to shoot 'em up zombie style.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This book is one of my favorites ! From very twist and turn in his life,I could not put down even if I tried. Even though I do not work in a kitchen,I find that his stories hold true for me.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was great. The only problem was that it is kind of gross. Multiple children die in gruesome ways (one gets ripped to shreds, one gets impaled, many get gross injuries and many go insane). This book has a great plot, great action, but not for kids under 12.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Loved this film when I saw it in the theaters so I knew I would buy it when it came out on DVD.  I've since watched it twice.

B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since I was a Kid and the TV showed previews of a new show that was coming out. All they had on was westerns at the time.<br /><br />When the first TV show came on, I was hooked for life...With a positive future.<br /><br />The first movie with Chris Pine was great, however the second one seemed a little slow. Looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />Bruce

0812986180|5.0|Book was incredible!!! It was hard to put down. It was well written and easy to read. I loved it.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|Now I believe I understand why Blackmore put a halt to playing hard rock music after viewing this DVD of \\"Black Masquerade\\" with his last assembled group of \\"Rainbow.\\"  In my opinion, he realized that it could never get any better than this, and the challenge was simply removed. The show here is just superb in so many aspects that there just aren't enough superlatives in my vernacular to properly address an adequate description.<br /><br />People say that Blackmore is a \\"rough', hard-to-get-along with guy.  He certainly does make life difficult for many people in his professional involvements on a high profile level by what I have read, and seen, (Hell or High Water),etc.  I am sixty years old, and have followed hard rock for decades, particularly guitarists, and NOBODY,<br />(not Stevie Ray, Malmsteen, Page, Beck, Satriani, Van Halen, Allmans, or any other that come to mind), can play this instrument with such amazing qualities such as grace note selections, enhancement choices, and flat out MELODY as this \\"hard to get along with\\" guy! NOBODY!!  I have listened to all his live stuff like \\"The Final Concerts\\" for years and it never fail to be \\"blown Away\\" by his mastery of the six strings.  But, I have said enough about Blackmore.<br /><br />This Dougie White guy is just the best vocalist RB has had since Cloverdale/Hughes, and maybe as good as Gillan in his prime, and that's saying something!  Taking nothing away from Bonnet, Turner, and Dio, (who I didn't particularly care for because his voice was too reminiscent of Plant's, or Byron to suit me.)  This guy interprets Gillan's lyrical masterpiece \\"Perfect Strangers\\" in a manner that really presents this great song in the way it deserves to be sang.  This is the highlight of the show for me, though every song here keeps you riveted to your seat!<br /><br />The players all seem to remind me of \\"top studio\\" guys, all masters of their instruments, and exceptionally knowledgeable of current progressive rock techniques of performance.  Yes, the bassist cannot be heard as well as the others in the mix, I give that, but when you finally convince yourself that he doesn't much matter to this show, he sings the Hughes part in the obligatory \\"Smokey Waters\\" at he end, and MAN! He can flat sing!<br /><br />The keyboard guy channels Jon Lord on the Purple standards, but like Don Airey, he builds upon the structures of the songs, making his performance unique.  When he plays the new \\"Stranger in Us\\" material; this guy simply SOARS beyond basic keyboard work! He mesmerizes the listener with articulate dexterity that seemed to even make Blackmore \\"jealous\\" at one point!<br /><br />Solid drummer, great drummer slightly reminiscent of Paice in the middle seventies,(or Today!), but a bit slicker, I think.  I believe Rondinelli could have handled this material, but not any better than the new guy!<br /><br />The show comes off, literally, like a theatrical, Shakespearian presentation in a festival setting.  It is very fast-moving, always presenting little \\"surprises\\" within the music, with exceptional choreography for a rock show.  Every word, (or facial expression), seems to service the song at hand, and is perfectly placed to accentuate the moment for the camera. The two, or three thousand attendees in the audience, (primarily Germans I imagine) seem very entertained.  [Europeans, particularly eastern Europeans are well versed in quality music, and are not as easy to please as Americans as a rule I understand.]  But, here, at this show, they get what they came for in spades.  The new songs that are played must just be the best songs on \\"Stranger\\", (I have not heard any of this record before this how), because this material is consistently excellent.  One called \\"Insatiable\\", another called \\"Ariel\\" are stunning.  Like I said earlier, there isn't a dead moment in the show.<br /><br />I once received an email from a guy that attended one of the Blackmore Night shows a few years ago, and he said that when the cameras are turned off, Blackmore comes out and spends a lot of time with the guys that try to just talk to him after the show, ..fans that just want a moment.  This guy told me in his email message that Blackmore was as polite, and reasonably interesting as he probably could be; answering old Purple questions, & whatever else he was asked.  I don't know how \\"nice\\" he is, I don't want to marry him!  I just want to say that this show is so good that it is very hard to come up with another rock concert DVD made in the last thirty years to rival it.  It ain't just Blackmore, it is this wonderful experience of watching/listening to this bunch of artists doing these songs, (including \\"Burn\\"!), in front of this audience, I think! I don't regret buying the DVD, (I usually just rent shows, but couldn't wait for this one to be released for rental.)hat when the cameras are turned off, Blackmore comes out and spends a lot of time with the guys that try to just talk to him after the show, ..fans that just want a moment.

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I like this game the only thing I don't like is how much cash cost. It cost way to much for the amount they offer . Otherwise this game is really great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three was great i want to read them again .can not wait until the movie comes out ..I LOVE MR.GRAY
B00CF34B2I|3.0|The game is good but it does have weird glitches that are easy to fix. The latest update broke it in my samsung 3s. It wont open up
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This is a hillarious movie.  I really enjoy watching it.  My daughter of 3 also loves it.  The humor is great, and anything that gets a 30 yr old and a 3 yr old laughing is good humor in my book.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|There is only one Tina Fey but we know, thanks to Tina, she is not alone and there are many Amy Poehlers and other fantastic comedy actresses who need to be exposed at ANY age ! It's not only funny to read, it's also a true picture of her world, our world we live in ;-) Enjoy !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was a little worried about video quality but this this is AMAZING!  It took a whole minute maybe 2 to set up and we were ready to go.  Netflix streams in HD quality just like if I were watching a rented movie.  Love it!
B00DXP7L88|3.0|I think some of the decisions made by Dexter this season was out of character, which ruined it for me.  Watching Dexter for 8 seasons you got to know the character and with this season Dexter felt out of placed to end the show in a pretty package.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|What happened to the precise and on-the-spot work of Ridley Scott?  He missed the boat with this followup to Alien.  The storyline was choppy and the characters wooden, unbelievable and hopelessly 2D.  If you're a fan of Alien, it is a requirement to see this film.  That said, you will have a hard time with it.  Consider watching it as a &#34;class assignment&#34;.  Watch it. Grade it.  Write your own report on why you think this movie fails to hold up the Alien franchise.  I can't help but wonder why Scott did this film.  Was it just for the money?  Did the writers quit midway through?  There was no spark, no love of the story in this.  Imagine if Mark Twain had written a sequel to Tom Sawyer that had the story's characters aimlessly ambling around on the Mississippi, achieving nothing, meeting no one, and, in the end, nothing really happened.  Well, that's what Scott did with this film.  What happened?  Not much.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|\\"Finding Pride\\" begins with an ending -- a funeral in Pride, Oregon, for the brother of main character Megan Kimble.  Megan is a wretched, battered woman fleeing the remnants of an abusive marriage.  All her life she has been beaten up physically or emotionally, learning to trust no one besides her loving brother.<br /><br />  Megan had no idea Matt had built a small empire to share with her.  Although Megan is suddenly independently wealthy, her imagination is captured by the Bed & Breakfast property Matt had been working on. It will be just the therapy she needs to restore her broken body and soul.<br /><br />  Matt was intertwined with Todd Jordan's family in various business ventures and had become for all purposes a member of their family. They automatically confer that same status on Megan. Todd and his younger brother, Iian, seem to compete for Megan's attention. Lacey Jordan, their petite sister, simply takes Megan under her gregarious and protective wing.<br /><br />  It's a lot for Megan to digest.  She feels a sense of belonging and kinship she's never had before. This is a place she can call home, where she can be happy and safe - until her ex-husband escapes from prison.<br /><br />  It's a classic tale of renewal, at times a bit formulaic. The characters grow on you and the setting is idyllic.  The only downside was a preponderance of technical issues in editing and formatting.  The storyline itself is good. It deserves to have the interior re-edited to make it a far more pleasant reading experience.  Hopefully the newer installments of the series have overcome these issues.
B008NC1LJ6|3.0|I trust the Bible and so I can begin to feel guilty about watching worldly movies that allow me to be tempted by the sinful things I will see.  I would rather spend my time sharing the true gospel with folks, but these days I run accross virtually no one that wants to hear the truth.  Anyway that is just background before I give my review (more an opinion really)  I give this film higher marks than I typically would because it actually (unwittingly I imagine) reinforces some Biblical truths.  One of these is shown best, I think in Proverbs 16, verse 9 reads \\"A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.\\"  See even though lines in this film speak of one's outcome being determined by the direction one chooses (at a fork in the road), Many times the situation itself dictates entirely which way is chosen, even being on the road to begin with may not truly be an option. if one is honest.  Perhaps the writer of this screen play was even trying to show this but my guess is rather that he had no real choice because if he truly tried to write every way as a true choice the movie would have been corny and unbelievable ...the truth of things breaks out and shines even in secular fiction and that is why I found this film entertaining.<br /><br />Truthfully there are a great many times I will start watching a movie but not far into it I see that it has no redeeming content to justify my watching it ... it is then not even a sacrifice to switch the TV off because I truly find many such as vile.  But this film included fate which is realistic in our lives ...and I know fate is just word that actually refers to God's will.  So before you or I pat ourselves too much on the back for making \\"good\\" choices, we ought to really really look at the whole situation honestly and ask just how much choice really exsisted anyway? ....I mean REALLY?<br /><br />With all that in mind I find enough merit in this movie to commend it to anyone that will consider Proverbs 16 verse9 as they watch it!  THAT is what made it enjoyable for me, and not the sex and violence.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is the most customizable gaming mouse I've ever used.  The interface software that comes with it is easy to use.  I've only seen features and quality like this in gaming mice in much higher cost brackets.  This mouse spoils me.  When I go to work and have to use my computer/mouse system there, I feel like I'm working in slow-motion.  It's a pleasure to come home and use this mouse.  I do a lot of 3D modeling work, and this mouse even makes that easier, so it isn't just for gaming.

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I bought this years ago.  When at a girls' weekend which included daughters, my niece asked to &#34;borrow&#34; this movie.  I told her okay, but I want it back.  I knew that would never happen.  So I have again purchased this movie for myself (but I haven't told my niece that).
B00AYQNOU8|4.0|This is really a treasure of beautiful, meditative, and wonderful time lapse images. I think the doc is strongest when the social commentary is obscure or left up to the judgement of the viewer.  I felt the out of place segment of an actor smearing his face with clay/war paint, etc. too shocking and editorial.  Some other images felt a bit too strong as well, and this film is definitely PG-13.  However, overall the rich ambience of images, wonderfully scored music, and diversity of cultural, physical and spiritual landscape make this a tremendous winner.
B000P407K4|5.0|Both hysterically funny and chilling scary. I suspect this film was one of a handful of artistic works which helped shape the stand own from the nuclear precipice.

0770435726|3.0|This book was entertaining enough but really not spectacular. Was super slow the entire book just about and then at the end, BAM! everything about the story was revealed in one chapter. The book was really far-fetched and just kind of boring...
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Starting watching the old seasons on Netflix- couldn't wait until Season 8 came out on DVD so I paid for it on Amazon. Great show.

0375869026|5.0|This book is so incredible. What an important piece of literature that I believe everyone on Earth should read. What a better world this would be if everyone were to experience this book. I wish I could personally thank the author for this. I couldn't put it down. I sat down to read a little bit and didn't get off the couch until I had finished the entire thing. I laughed, I cried, and I became inspired! Please please please read this book!
B000006NXP|5.0|This disc, now successfully remastered form a 1981 digital original, has always been ranked as among the very finest of recent generations. It is always a doubtful idea to suggest that any one performance of such core repertoire is a definitive performance / recording as at that level personal preferences bring inevitable personal prejudices and inevitable conflict. Such a situation is not helpful to collectors or other interested parties.<br /><br />Brahms wrote this work at the end of his life. It is normal practice to consider him as one of the most important figures of the Romantic period but this view can be open to question when considering the emphasis he placed on structural content of his work, his detailed use of Classical compositional devices and relatively restrained use of the orchestra that he had at his disposal. There is also a marked lack of narrative or nationalist interest beyond his Hungarian dances. The Hungarian elements to be found in his other works are part of the structure and not generally the main focus.<br /><br />All of this has been mentioned because it is in the Classical period sense that the listener can best appreciate Kleiber's interpretation/performance with the VPO. This is a very strong delivery of the music with enormous emphasis on the structure. Indeed, it could be described as a very tough-minded view with little evidence of softening or yielding to allow for any Romantic period moulding of the lines or of the emotions. The last movement in this performance thus is a study in the delivery of a strictly formal structure placed as the conclusion of a determined and logical musical journey. This is a plan that would be recognisable in any Classical composer, Beethoven springs readily to mind, and is quite foreign even to the early Romantics such as Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann. Emotional satisfaction, not to be confused with Romanticism, is thus achieved by unflinching formal Classical means.<br /><br />This is a strikingly formal, even austere, account of the symphony and as such, it stands apart from the rest. There will be those who resist its Classical progress just as there will be those who find it uniquely rewarding and totally appropriate.<br /><br />Whatever one's personal response, I would suggest that this disc remains one of the great artistic and recorded achievements of its generation. Owning it will enhance and broaden one's understanding and therefore it deserves to be seriously considered as a strong candidate for purchase.e, account of the symphony and as such, it stands apart from the rest.

B001AACEP8|5.0|This is a classic for the Katy Perry fans, as being her first album to hit the scene and bring her pop debut to a rise. I thoroughly enjoy the album to this day. She has grown as an artist, but I still appreciate her latter music.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|its not the best game, but it sure isn't the worst. I do like it, but I hate all the bugs in the game.

B00E688KA4|4.0|Týr's seventh studio offering follows the same musical style established in the last two albums; The Lay of Thrym and By the Light of the Northern Star. It's the same straight-forward, more aggressive, and less progressive Týr sound we've become accustomed to. That said, this is not entirely a typical \\"heard it all before,\\" Amon Amarth-esque, cookie-cutter album. Valkyrja sets itself apart with superior writing, catchier riffs, and a little more in-album variation in style than the previous two albums.<br /><br />The first track, Blood of Heroes, is pretty typical. It chugs along with solid riffs and drums, and has a nice, short guitar bridging solo. The song is not particularly impressive or lasting, but it isn't bad.<br /><br />Next, the most surprising song of the album, Mare of my Night. This song features very explicit lyrics, which surprised me coming from a band that is usually very classy. Even so, this song is catchy and the lyrics actually discuss a legend associated with nightmares. It's strange hearing the words in this song, but it isn't offensive or undignified, like a particular song on the latest Turisas offering, because it has a purpose and isn't presented in a casually lewd manner.<br /><br />Moving along to Hel Hath No Fury: another straight-forward song with a catchy melody and chorus. Once again, another unsurprising but enjoyable song.<br /><br />Next up is a one-of-a-kind Týr song, The Lay of Our Love. This song features female guest vocals from Liv Kristine of Leaves' Eyes. It's your typical ballad-type song with some nice guitar solos and harmonizing vocals.<br /><br />Track five is called Nation. Once again, yet another predictable but generally catchy song. I don't care for the chorus as much in this song but it isn't bad, nonetheless.<br /><br />Another Fallen Brother is up next. It's the second single released and it is similarly typical of Týr.<br /><br />Number seven is Grindavísan, a song with an opening reminiscent of Turið Torkilsdóttir's, but with a clearly different structure that sets itself apart. One of my more favored songs on the album, and generally the place I start listening if I don't have time to sit through the entire album.<br /><br />Into the Sky is the next track and it is one of my favorites. It shows interesting writing and vocal work, despite the generally familiar structure and repetition.<br /><br />Next up is Fánar Burtur Brandaljóð, another favorite, perhaps my number one? Hard to say. Either way, it's less predictable and the guitar work is excellent, much like the vocals. English is my only language, but I never have a hard time enjoying the vocals of Týr's songs that aren't in english because Heri is such a talented vocalist. The heart of the vocals is there, whether you understand the words or not.<br /><br />Following that is Lady of the Slain, another familiarly structured song, but perhaps the heaviest and fastest on the album.<br /><br />Lastly, the title track, Valkyrja. A great song all-around. More reminiscent of older Týr songs and just as enjoyable.<br /><br />The album also features two excellent cover tracks. They pretty much nail them.<br /><br />So if I've said \\"typical\\" so many times, why do I enjoy it? Because while few parts of the album surprised me, Týr almost never fails to create catchy riffs and excellent vocal melodies accompanied by plenty of interesting solos. Heri has a fantastic voice, even though his upper range isn't the best (as apparent on the Iron Maiden cover). It's not a very innovative album but it is sure as hell enjoyable. If you want more progressive Týr-like music, check out the side-project Heljareyga. I'm sure a lot of Týr fans aren't even aware it exists, but it is really worth a listen if you enjoy Týr.<br /><br />Now for my only real issue with the album: the recording quality. Throughout the entire album, the lead guitars are accompanied by a subtle, high-pitched, nails-on-the-chalkboard-esque sound that drives me crazy. I've listened to the album on Audio-Technica ATH-M50 cans, SoundMAGIC E10 eadbuds, Corsair SP2500 2.1 speakers, and whatever the hell my car speakers are, through various devices including: ASUS Xonar DGX, Sound Blaster Z SBX, HTC One with Beats audio, and my car stereo. I've even listened from multiple sources, such as YouTube videos, lossless WAV rips, and straight from the CD. The issue is always present.<br /><br />I give the album itself about 77.5 / 100. I'd say the recording issue drops it at least ten points further, but I think the writing and execution deserves better. This album deserved better recording quality, but it nonetheless deserves a listen. Give it a shot. If you liked anything Týr has done so far, you'll probably find something to like about this album.
0984334904|5.0|Detailed on how to draw them,  explicit as to what the drawings/radicals represent so that you can picture why the kanji you are learning has that meaning, very good for learning!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Another great series especially when you need a laugh after a hard day a work put on big bang and your laughing alot.  I am so happy this is here so I can put it in and enjoy the fun and laughter....
0385738773|5.0|This trilogy is amazingly good and I'm so glad I purchased this book. If you liked the Hunger Games then you may like these books too. I know I loved both trilogies!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Great read for Reacher fans.  It gives a glimpse into his life as an MP and evidence that he isn't the loner he appears to be.  He has a deep sense of loyalty to his former unit, which proves to be as close to friendship (and family) that Reacher has left.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Maybe eventually when there are broader applications for this, it will be more useful to me. At least it was inexpensive.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|The film is a wonderful piece of art which is why I bout it. However, the image quality of this copy was not perfect. I even wondered if the sellers had reproduced copies using a cheaper way than the usual. The colors were not as good as when I saw the film at the movie theatre.
0307476073|5.0|If you like real life being lived out, adventure, laughter, and tears...this book is for you!  Good read will suggest it to my friends and family.

B003D0E3FM|5.0|Some of the older scifi movies are so cool they never get to old to watch. I saw this movie as a small child growing up and I was glade to see it on amazons movie list to rent.<br />I'm a super scifi fan and I love this movie it has some of this bests effects for when it was made. Any scifi fan would really love this so don't pass it up...
B00F35BV64|4.0|Was entertaining - but using the old themes was a bit demeaning to the original stories. Should the writers/producers have another one in the fold for the near future - get some original ideas.
1439152810|5.0|What a great read! The story hooked me from the beginning. if you have never read any of Kate Morton's novels, this is an excellent first book. Read it. Re-read it and then go online and read all you can about it!! Just a terrific novel!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the automated features minimizing the need for moving each card by hand. This game can be easy or challenging, and is a great escape or mind sharpener, depending on your need.
B008EQIA7W|5.0|The movie is well made with lots of action and it dose not let you down...  I love scifi movies and I found this one to be one of the best I have watched. It is worth the price to rent if you like scifi movies or it would be worth ordering if you collect this type of movie..
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Pretty good movie.  Some of the stuff was a little over the top but, hey it was fiction.  Liked the surprise ending.
0783240287|5.0|Awesome musical.  The production value of the DVD is lacking but if you are ok w/ adjusting the volume the music more than makes up for it!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I have always enjoyed the stargate series. I am glad I can watch them all without any commercials to interupt.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I think this is a great game for kids and gets their brains going. I know I love this game and you will too
B00E8KLWB4|2.0|I have tried several times now to download this game and it just WILL NOT DOWNLOAD!! WHAT THE HECK. If you read this PLEASE fix this issue. I HAVE THE SPACE AND ALL THAT!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the story and found the characters very believable. I would recommend this book to others who enjoy mysteries and surprise endings.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Love the classic movie \\"A Christmas Carol\\" ,however, growing up as a kid with the muppets in their prime... this tops most versions!
B000HZGNDG|5.0|I will always argue this was the best film in the original franchise. It is a fantastic way to end a good run (excluding film five, let's forget that one happened shall we?).
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this new style of singing; it's more like the old days and not so much Hip Hop.<br />Bruno has such a sweet sounding voice.<br />I think he'll continue to Wow us with his work. Nice fresh approach.
B00E5INZ82|3.0|I would say this is good to waste some time, but I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time playing this game.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I can't stand opera and I loved this movie.  Love the variety of music and that they found so many retired musicians to play parts.  It was just a wonderful evening's entertainment.  I'll probably buy it.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Matrix style fighting meets dystopian future where all emotion is banished.  Its okay, really that's about all I can say about it. Just okay.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love this book. The story just overwhelmed me, I cried like baby. I felt like I was in her life feeling her pain.
B0074V33MK|5.0|Great insight into what a prisonor of war went through.  So much is not know about this subject.  Amazing how that generation that expected everything to just fall into place again after such a horrible time.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book is a in a VERY different style from Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It's more of a sci-fi mysterious type rather than a sci-fi action book.  I wasn't a huge fan of all the Portuguese names and language in it, nothing against the Portuguese--my ignorant self just found it difficult to understand and the characters' names were hard to pronounce (in my head).  It was a kind of existential book with some good moral questions that made you think about how we perceive things.  Not what I was expecting at all after reading Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow, but I'm glad I read it.  Not sure how many more of the series I will read though as I prefer sci-fi action.
B000HZCZYW|3.0|Worst film of the original franchise. They were reaching when it came to this plot. Thank God the sixth redeemed the series
0345529057|5.0|Loved the series....can't believe all my favorite characters die but that's the way it is.<br />My only complaint is that the pages of books, the paper is so thin!  If I share this series as I usually do, the books won't last long.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|If you have not seen breaking bad you should. It is about the hand we get dealt in life and the choices we make to make things better for you and your family. There is the hard path and the easy path in life and deciding between right and wrong. &#34;Is it ok to do something bad if the end goal is to do something good?&#34;<br />Season 1 sets up the back story for the rest of the series and is worth watching but is not as exciting as say season 3,4,and 5.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|My son borrows my Kindle Fire frequently to use this app to fall asleep. Very quiet even with volume turned all the way up.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|There is nothing left to add for a review that the fanboy club has not gushed about already. Good cast, especially Dr. Banner. Good setup for a sequel.
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|Perhaps if I hadn't watched the &#34;Avengers&#34; first, I would have enjoyed this movie better. I only bought the movie because of<br />the other movie. If I had just rented the movie would be fine.....
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have read most of Ken Follett's books and this one is up to the standards I expect of him.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read WW II stories.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My 5 year old loves this app!  When her other 5 year old friends play it... they ask their mom and dads for it too!
015670160X|3.0|Just like it was supposed to the item came when it was supposed to, it was also in good condition like it was stated, I was happy about this sale
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Haven't opened the packet yet but watched it on television and LOVED it.  Just wanted to add it to my dvd library.
B00E7PQVHK|5.0|Great game! Best RPG I've found so far for mobile. Addicting!<br /><br />Works with no glitches so far after two hour's of game play.
0399215980|3.0|too small and I don't really think it's a good story.  It was on my daughters kindergarten reading list... i wasn't impressed.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|If you like to spend time with your kids and like boxing, then you will love this movie.  It is fun and very well made.<br />I recomend it, you won't be dissapointed
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood! The first season I fell in love w/ this series! When the grandmother was murdered I was so saddened (crazy huh?). I'm a die hard fan.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love it easy to see and set up. Like you can set multiple alarms. Nice to choose what sound you want to wake up to
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|My phone charger has been good for my business, good for my nerves, and good for my image. I keep one tucked in my bag or purse at all times. I've charged my new Samsung phone, I've been able to finish a book on my kindle when my  juice ran out, and I never will need to fight for a plug at a flight gate when my battery was dwindling because there has been a long wait.<br /><br />So far, twice I have impressed  colleagues so much with my ability to whip out my little life saving charger that I felt compelled to give each of them mine...so last time I ordered two, knowing that it will happen again that charger envy will guilt me so much I'll have to share.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I just recently started reading the Jack Reacher series & I like them immensely. Jack's character is growing & coming alive for me. Thanks Mr. Child.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Watched each episode on cable; loved them. Can't wait to receive the third season to watch again and again! yeah!
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|the apps that I bought thru amazon apps store quit working, said i needed to download them again, but was not able to get the app store from my tablet
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I Loved it! Reading it a second time and probably will read it a third! Definitely a series worth buying!!!
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|This is a fine addition to the Progressive Rock catalog. The song writing, musicianship, and production are all excellent. If you're a fan of Genesis and/or any of the member's solo or side projects, you'll love this. I'm already looking forward to this band's next release. Highly recommended.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|This movie is funny, lighthearted; makes one smile.  Enjoyed from beginning to end; made me a fan of Mila (Spelling?)
1250029465|5.0|I bought this book for my mom, but I had to read it as well. Such a wonderful story when we live in such troubling times.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Fan of the Lethal Weapon series (particularly 1 and 2)?  More importantly, did you see and enjoy Kiss-Kiss, Bang-Bang starring Marvel Poster-boy Downey?  Perhaps you would enjoy it more than you would if you were looking for something more akin to what we just came off of in the Avengers and previous Iron Man iterations.  The third in this character franchise is stands a bit clearer away from its two previous flicks.  It is very much a Shane Black story--a Christmas story with [[[[[Spoiler]]]] corrupt politicians and CEOs.  True, the latter was very central to the previous movies, but for Black its a particularly favored character-villain.  Then, too, we have the actual story delivery:  it is being told to us.<br /><br />That's why it is more a spiritual successor to Kiss-Kiss.  It has the similar background characters.  Drug users, alcoholics, and everyone's armed to the teeth in repartee.  It's during Christmas.  Simple as that, Christmas is his preferred backdrop.  And it's a detective story.  We have Iron Man's CSI and a few sequences where he's investigating and picking up leads.  That's more fun than you would expect, but it's quite different than what most people wanted.  As a fan of Black's storytelling, this would be right up  your alley.  It worked for me.<br /><br />This movie might lack in Iron Man flying about. A super hero movie without the superhero's trademark armor in flight and on display?  Yet it is still an Iron Man story (\\"I am Iron Man,\\" after all; but as an interesting aside, the original line was going to read \\"I am Tony Stark\\" as if to say these Stark/Iron Man movies are indeed about the personality more than they are about the suit).  You get what you got in the first two.  Tony is center-stage and fun as hell when he's gabbing on about anything.  The action sequences in the flick are satisfying too even without the suit.<br /><br />Now, the big issue is in the Mandarin and the confusion around him.  For comic fans, this was obviously a huge disappointment.  They wanted their Kingsley to be the Mandarin and they wanted their martial arts expert with Super Science rings.  That was nowhere near what they got, but when you finally finish up the movie, can it not be said that the Mandarin was a presence and was an individual?  True, he winds up without any of the notable powers in the comics, but the villain remains a powerful combatant anyway.<br /><br />All in all, that part is up to everyone as is everything I appreciated in the film.  I do think this was a good movie and superior to the second.  I hope if there's another Iron Man flick that they try new daring things that could potentially piss people off again.
B008DVJOKU|5.0|I bought this vinyl for myself awhile ago and love it. Sent it as a gift to some friends that have a record player, we take turns sending vinyls to one another. They love this album too. It is today's Southern Rock and Blackberry Smoke is where it is at!!!

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Why does this little book make sense?  It appeals to the fabric of sanity and the core of who we really are. Pam writes from her heart appealing to all generations using common sense.

0345529057|5.0|I'm not that far in and I already love the series. I haven't watched the show like most other people and I want to wait until I read the books first so I had little to no idea coming into it about what the story would really be like but it is so well written and I loved getting the first 4 in a package deal.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No period drama has ever achieved this level of perfection. It combines humor, drama, romance, history but most of all, a peak into the personalities and hearts of these intriguing characters.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|i really liked this game hahaha now you can join the PORK SIDE WHICH IS AMAZING!!!!! COMPLETELY AWESOME :P WORTH THE DOLLAR
B0037QGS0A|4.0|Liked all actors involved...but wanted this movie because Amanda Seyfried was in the movie. She is a talented actress and I enjoy watching her movies.
0425266060|5.0|enjoyed this series very much, if you like 50 Shades, you will love this! couldn't stop turning the pages on this one
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story continue to build in this season as it did in the first two.  Brilliant story, fabulous writing, spectacular cast - yes, I loved it!<br /><br />I will be very sad if it ever ends...
B00AALX5SI|5.0|I liked learning about Katy.... she is talented and has come fro a different place to being happy.  very creative
0425266060|5.0|I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into this series. I got the package early, which was nice and I started reading right away. It is a quick moving story, but so worth it to read. You will not be able to put the book down!

B0041D843M|5.0|The study is comprehensive, verified through extensive research, human observation, and professional collaboration. The book clearly shows how the failing health of Americans is related to our gluttonous eating habits coupled with our lack of knowledge respecting the chemical ridden foods we eat. And possibly most importantly, shows how more drugs and surgery cannot possibly save us from ourselves.<br /><br />I believe this study is more relevant today than ever given the the exceedingly fast pace the youth of our country, our future, are becoming chronically ill.<br /><br />Five stars, and should be required reading for all health care professionals.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|This is just another bad remake.  I like Karl Urban but this movie was stupid.  Don't waste your time watching it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. If I had five minutes to spare before a meeting, I would pull out my Kindle to try and read some more. It is a very well written book, and I got so wrapped up in the characters and the story line. I have not gotten lost in a book like I did this one in a very long time. A must-read!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Only able to watch half of the movie.  I paused it and it never resumed.  I tried many times, many different ways.  Very disappointed.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|Does not fit iphone5. Would not recommend. Clamp piece breaks off at width of iPhone even with no case on. Plastic against phone is not a good holding mechanism.
B003QSS2VW|3.0|Streaming was horrible, so we had to slog through this, just to get it watched.  Amazon, as a &#34;courtesy,&#34; refunded my money.  If they hadn't, I would have given it no stars, and a scathing review.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, and it makes you think. Makes me appreciate living in modern times.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Who doesn't love Paul Rudd?  He is a hilarious 40 something actor, and he has done a fabulous job in this movie.  My husband and I watched it together, and we both laughed out loud.

B00DNDR29I|2.0|As a Janelle Monae fan of the first hour, when she wasn't known neither in America nor in Europe, I got a first glimpse of her in the TV show 'Making the Band'. That's when she caught my attention and made me want to hear more of her sound as I was immediately excited about this very unique musical experience! Shortly afterwards I bought her first EP ' Metropolis : Suite 1' - and even though it only included 7 songs and was very pricey at the time, I liked every single song and the uniqueness of the artist / sound on it. That's actually how I became a fan of hers!<br /><br />Three years later she finally released her 1st studio album ' TheArchAndroid : Suites 2 & 3', which made her internationally known after playing on several festivals in Europe. With 18 brilliant songs ' TheArchandroid ' is still one of my absolute favorite albums. The songs are powerful, energetic and as her known trademark the sound is very futuristic, mixed with RnB, Funk and even elements from the 'Musical' genre = explosive & unusual mixture !<br /><br />After another 3 years of waiting, in which I googled for news about a possible sequel on an almost daily basis, Summer 2013 and therefor the first single from the new album ' QUEEN ' came along. As fans immediately noticed the sound was different, slightly funky but at the same time somehow more mainstream. I liked the song but I didn't love it, so I was hoping for many new songs on the album I could fall in love with instead. When I heard the album on a legal live stream on the internet a while back, I was completely disappointed! In my opinion the overall sound had nothing to do with her previous suites. Where was her trademarked futuristic sound I loved so much?!!!<br />Rather than travelling to the future, so it seemed, she travelled back in time to revive Rock & Roll. When I heard her statement in an interview , in which she announced that she didn't want to repeat anything on the new album, it was obvious and made ​​perfect sense while comparing all 3 plays.. As much as I really wanted to fall in love with 'The Electric Lady', just like I did with her previous Ep & album, I ended up not feeling it - at all. I do like ' Electric Lady ' and ' Prime Time ' though, although one shouldn't compare these songs with her previous songs like 'Cold War' and many others that were so powerfull & energetic! Also while listening to the album stream I happened to find he radio DJ interludes very annoying and I asked myself why they even made the cut..<br /><br />Conclusion: I think it's great that Janelle Monae still follows through with the concept of the suites, as it shows that she's a true visionary - but to me, ' The Electric Lady ' sounds pretty wishy-washy and simply not nearly as powerful as 'theArchandroid'. I can't help but to think that it sounds much more mainstream as her previous efforts. The songs dabble relatively low in energy and therefore simply didn't touch nor sweep me away! I am pleased to see that the album got positive reviews - worldwide - and even though a lot of people say that Janelle herself seems pretty full of herself lately with her worldwide fame, I don't really care about that nor have I thought about this. All I care about is powerful & futuristic music I can identify myself with.<br />That's how I ended up cancelling the pre-order of the album.<br /><br />Unfortunately when criticizing a product one is automatically considered a 'hater' - it seems to be quite common not to tolerate any other opinion than your own when it comes to your favourite singer / artist and taste in music. But it should be obvious by my review, that I myself am disappointed that I ended up not liking this album while anticipating it for such a long time! I truly hope that the chapter 'Janelle Monae' isn't history for me just yet and that maybe - after another few years of idle time - I'll enjoy the successor of 'The Electric Lady' once she'll hopefully go back to her roots!<br /><br />18.9.2013, Switzerland (Europe)
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|Ive watched this close to ten times. If only George Bush had watched it once. History repeats itself, needlessly.<br />This documentary was so well done, with McNamara's lessons learned, and the Philip Glass score put this at over 5 star.
0618918248|3.0|I have read \\"The God Delusion\\" five times to date and am not at all convinced that it presents a good case for the non-existence of a supernatural being.  I have much respect for Dr. Dawkins and think he is completely sincere about what he believes but feel he has overstepped the boundaries of science in his efforts to promote his atheistic view of life.  For one thing he thinks in \\"natural\\" terms, or rather his concept of God has to somehow adhere to and obey natural laws.  Dawkins argues that if God existed he would necessarily have to be even MORE complex than the most complex things of his \\"creation\\".  But what does complexity (or simplicity) mean to a supernatural God? I'm inclined to think they mean nothing at all.  Again, Dawkins attempts to discredit God's existence by proclaiming he cannot be both all-knowing and all-powerful at the same time--- by saying that if God is all-knowing he must know the future, for instance what will happen next week.  But then if he is all-powerful he must be able to change that future. Dawkins says no. Dawkins seemingly thinks the future is somehow \\"carved in stone\\"  and can't be changed once it \\"becomes\\" the future.  Naturally someone would think this if they don't believe in a supernatural God.  But it seems perfectly reasonable to me that an all-powerful being COULD change the future anytime he so desired.  For instance let's assume for the sake of argument that a supernatural God does indeed exist.  If he is all-knowing he would have certainly known what was said about the Titanic--- \\"Not even God can sink this ship!\\"  What arrogance that would be to a supernatural God! Enough I'm sure to cause him to set into motion certain events and even certain human thoughts- for instance the thoughts of the Titanic's captain and certain of its crew members such that not long thereafter the great ship is broken apart and resting on the bottom of the North Atlantic. But before such an arrogant statement was uttered maybe the future wasvery different.  Perhaps in this former future the Titanic's captain and crew cautiously heeded the iceberg warning and made it safely into New York. This is just one example of the flawed logic that the atheistic mind is liable to succumb to. Of course to the atheist and all those who ascribe to a naturalistic view of life the foregoing is just sheer nonsense.  I understand this.  But to all those who believe in an all-powerful and all-knowing supernatural God I suspect it makes perfect sense. If you start out with the premise that God is a delusion then you're bound to arrive at a conclusion such as,  \\"The future is the future and nothing can change it!\\" Nothing that is except an all-powerful and all-knowing supernatural being.

B004JMZPJG|5.0|It's fit my DSLR perfectly, with pretty much any lens that I have on it. I normally shot primes, so when one is mounted on the camera, I've even managed to fit my 55-200 zoom lens in the side pocket, and my wallet in the other. I recommend this bag if you're not carrying much, or are creative enough to squeeze a few more things into it.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|WORLD WAR Z certainly got a lot of unjustified bad press before its release. Over budget and full of delays, it seemed like a pet project of a major star who had gone overboard. I hesitated to see the film and now can happily say the critics were wrong.<br /><br />The zombies are at it again and this time they are in every corner of the world. No place is safe, especially large cities. These zombies are new and improved. They are almost super zombies who can jump and soar through the sky yet as with all zombies, there are a few constants. A shot to the head is the only sure way to kill a zombie. If a zombie bites you, you become one of them within seconds. Zombies meander without any purpose other than to create more zombies. Got that? Then follow along.<br /><br />WORLD WAR Z has a brief set-up. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) has left his job at the United Nations and is a stay-at-home dad for his two adorable daughters and loving wife. It's a tranquil and happy, if uneventful, existence. I was never clear as to what his exact job was at the U.N. and why he left. It seems like he was some sort of investigator in dangerous war zones. It only takes a few minutes for the action to begin and things get intense and terrifying. WORLD WAR Z has begun without any sort of advance warning.<br /><br />Lane is called back to work for the U.N. to uncover the origin of the zombie plague, but first he and his family have to be rescued from the zombies and taken to aircraft carriers far offshore. The action is intense for a while and it does raise questions of what will governments do when the zombies attack. How will the uninfected be rescued and where will they go? The decision is made to send Lane to find Patient Zero and where the pathogen originated. The journey starts in South Korea and Lane is always one step ahead of hoards of attacking zombies.<br /><br />There are plenty of special effects and action in WORLD WAR Z but it almost seems less about the zombies than about inter-personal relationships and how one lives through a zombie attack. The zombie pathogen spreads quickly across through the globe thanks to air travel..though if a person bit by a zombie becomes a zombie in seconds, we see how soon everyone in a plane becomes infected so who ends up flying and landing the plane? We can overlook some flaws in the script and just enjoy a good zombie movie.<br /><br />Brad Pitt has certainly grown up through the years and no longer is just another pretty face. In fact, Pitt looks aged and weathered in WORLD WAR Z. Are those wrinkles around his eyes created through make-up or is Pitt going natural? Pitt does a fine job as he tries to find the weak link in the zombie chain. Is there a vaccine that can save mankind or can the zombies be stopped. Rest assured that our hero won't give up.<br /><br />Lane travels to Israel where the government has been able to keep the zombies out. Jersusalem is even taking refugees  until the zombies seem to work in unision to form human pyramids to scale walls. Thousands of zombies are on the attack in Jerusalem and it is pure chaos. Young Israeli solder Segen (played by a remarkable Daniella Kertesz) bravely fights the zombies until she is bit by one and Lane quickly acts to save her in a serious OUCH! moment.<br /><br />While watching the zombies in action in Jerusalem, Lane realizes the zombies avoid certain people. Those \\"healthy\\" individuals aren't attacked, and lane thinks he knows why, but he has to find a research facility to test his theory. Of course, that involves leaving Jerusalem and getting to another country by plane, but we know what can happen on a plane is just one crankly zombie stows away. All this adventure does make the movie fun and engaging.<br /><br />Although WORLD WAR Z follows the zombie routine seen in countless films and TV shows, it does breath a bit of fresh air into the genre. Fans of zombie films won't be disappointed and anyone who likes a sci-fi/action film will find lots to enjoy in WORLD WAR Z. Although it is far from perfect, WORLD WAR Z tries and succeeds in giving the viewer a lavish and thrilling zombie-fest.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Excellent book. Very easy to follow. I didn't see the ending coming. As<br />Soon as I can I 'm going to read The Reversal.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I honestly didn't know what was coming next in the plot. I recommend Oblivion to any person that enjoys sci-fi.
B00BKW8XME|4.0|Looks and feels like the original, seems to be pretty sturdy. It's a little tricky to put on, and you want to make sure all 4 little clips are in before you get going and think it's on completely. Getting it off is trickier, but once you get the hang of it, it's not so bad; you just have to wiggle it and wiggle it before it loosens itself off. As far as it staying on there, it seems to stay secure doing my own tap-twist-slight bump test. I'm sure it will coming flying off if I bump it hard enough against something, but I hope to never know that.

6304806434|5.0|This movie is excitement from beginning to end.  With a cast of wonderful actors it's a real winner.  Each character is a very strong presence n this movie, But Nicholas Cage really is great!  Without giving away the story, it's about a bunch of convicts who are being transferred to another prison and they end up taking over the plane!  John Cusack plays a great Federal Agent trying to save the innocent people on the plane (the guards, pilots, and one lone ex-con on his way home).

B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great movie, I had never actually watched it all the way through.  Watched it through and loved it!  Good actors, classic movie.
B0024FAG6M|5.0|Don't watch it for the cinematography or the special effects. Don't watch it for the acting, music or costumes.  Just watch it. It was never meant to be a blockbuster, just a low buck art film. It is not a shining example of any of the casts best work, but it has a deep message and is a window to the era.  I suppose if we were living in that era it's avant-garde message would have stuck us and we would have cheered the performance.  Today, not having lived in that era, and spoiled by modern techno-cinema, I missed a lot, but I did see many comparisons and points that were trying to be exposed.  Compare them to today.  I dare you.  After you watch it then run the commentary or the special features and see if your observations were correct.

B00A2H9L2E|2.0|Silent Hill: Revelation (Michael J. Bassett, 2012)<br /><br />[censored for Amazon consumption]. I hate that this movie even exists. The original Silent Hill may not be the best videogame adaptation in all of film, but if it isn't, it's in the top two. Despite it being pretty much impossible for a sequel to have continued on down that same road--there wasn't terribly much left at the end of the first movie to work with--I was still cautiously optimistic when I heard this second one was coming out; I figured they would keep the actual town of Silent Hill intact (and indeed, Deborah Kara Unger returns) and come up with a completely unrelated story. And they kinda-sorta did, but here's the movie's first problem: Laurent Hadida, turning in his first adaptation, decided to try and tie the story in using a series of ridiculous coincidences and stretches.<br /><br />Plot: Heather (The Great Gatsby's Adelaide Clemens) and her father have spent the entirety of Heather's young life moving from town to town; as we open, they've found themselves in another generic suburb, and Heather is starting at another new school. This time, however, there's another new kid: Vincent (Games of Thrones' Kit Harrington). The two of them, against Heather's better judgment, bond, and when Heather's father goes missing, and she finds a message scrawled on the wall of their apartment telling her to come to Silent Hill if she wants to save him, Vincent tags along--but it turns out that none of the players have the full story...<br /><br />...and I'm not entirely sure the screenwriters did, either. Once Heather and Vincent get to Silent Hill, the actual storyline takes a back seat to the crew's desire to shove as many special effects into this movie as possible. And it's not the back seat of a sedan, either, it's the back seat of a very long bus. There are some times when this is not necessarily a bad thing. We all knew going in that Alien vs. Predator was going to be a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and we went to the theater and sat down, and it was a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and I had a whale of a time. But Silent Hill, that was something entirely different, creepy and atmospheric and effective, and most importantly for the sake of this discussion a movie that set a bar that its sequel was going to have to live up to--never mind that the chances that it could were vanishingly small. And we went to the theater, we sat down (okay, I dialed it up on Netflix Instant, but still), and we got a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, but one that didn't even have the breakneck pace of AvP; there was a stage in this film's development where Bassett and Co. really were trying to make a movie that would have stood up to the first one. Somewhere along the way, I suspect, that idea got dropped, but not enough of it got removed during the rewrite to even make this a guilty pleasure; instead, the first half of the movie, as inept as it is, serves to highlight what could have been had a little more thought been put into this. * ½tuff blows up, and we went to the theater and sat down, and it was a stupid movie where a lot of stuff blows up, and I had a whale of a time.

B0014VQGX4|3.0|We were looking for a metal backhoe like tonka used to make for our 4 year old. The Bruder toys have the realistic mobility and we were so excited by the claims of durability. However soon after opening the box my son was playing with his new toy and the front end loader bucket broke where it attaches. Now we can order a new part, but the toy just came and its broken already? We were bummed. In addition, the legs that are set down for the back hoe do not work right. One will not lock up, the other will not lock down. This is after normal play not rough. There is definitely some quality to the make up of this toy, but it is no die cast Tonka.

0393327655|4.0|This is a well written book in which most people should be able to understand in context.  However, the arguments and statements that Dr. Harris makes when criticizing and accusing religion for some if not all of the world's maladies are quite disputable.  For example, he listed a number of conflicts and genocides in his book that he claims can be attributed to religion, but at the same time tends to ignore other factors related to what caused the conflicts or what kept them going.  The conflict for example in Sri Lanka was not a religious war, but one of ethnic rivalry and longstanding grievance as a result of British colonial rule.  Each group in Sri Lanka adheres to a different religion, but that was not the driving force for conflict.  Rwanda was another conflict of ethnic hatred bred from French colonial rule which also had absolutely nothing to do with religion, but an insistent separation of local peoples in order to better rule.  This normally causes a group or groups to be or feel disenfranchised.  It is also used as a mechanism to keep the local population divided.  Dr. Harris leaves Rwanda out of his book all together.  Was this a matter of convenience or ignorance?  Also, from a Christian perspective he talks about the lack of reason but never once mentions the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, who Christian and many Secular philosophers widely agree reconciled faith and reason in \\"The Summa Theologica.\\"  Lastly, Dr. Harris claims that never has a civilization or peoples committed egregious atrocities for being too reasonable.  He may have a point here, but it is face-value.  The question that one may ask is even if one were to achieve a nation or state in which reason was paramount, how would that state deal with those who disagree or refuse to go along with them?  What is the reasonable way to deal with these folks?  How do you measure reason and what level is sufficient for the proper and happy governance of a nation?  Realistically, reason will becomea new religion in some form whose deity will be a person or people who like other civilizations throughout history will control and manipulate the masses.  In other words, \\"reasonable\\" people can be just as cruel and abusive as religious or extremists as long as they convince themselves that what they are doing is right.

B0036S4B6M|3.0|I enjoyed the book, however, it is so different from the show. Because of this - though the cover is a photo of the characters of the show - I think this should be noted in the description of the book. This is only fair.
1481130331|5.0|Packed full of history, highly gifted Fischer somehow effortlessly tells this multi-levelled tale. From the first to the last page, this book is an immensely emotional ride, filled with intrigue, suspense, courage and perseverance.<br />Set in Eastern Europe during WWII, this impassioned story follows The Weissensteiner family, their friends and foes, as they change, evolve, adapt and struggle to cope with the atrocities of the war. This remarkable novel has a large variety of complex characters, each doing whatever is necessary, in order for them to attempt to survive the war and it's aftermath. The diversity of the characters enables the author to portray the experiences, ideologies and vast view points held by people caught on different sides of the war. Friends become foes, foes become friends, and we see how they change their beliefs, actions and attitudes due to the circumstances forced upon them.<br />I highly recommend that when you start this story that you have the time to read as much as possible without interruption, as this story pulls you in and you will not want to put it down.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Overall a Good book , kept me interested with some twists and turns in the plot but the majority of it was all about sex, almost too much. Would like to see a stronger plot with the next book.  I do like learning about the different aspects of BDSM, and the reason behind why a lot of broken people are into it.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I was looking for a basic watch with a nylon band that I could wear every day, something inexpensive enough that I would not regret banging up or losing down a storm drain. When I first got this watch, a few things irked me: the day abbreviations on the day/date window are bilingual, and sometimes I was reading the days in spanish abbreviations. Also, I was always having to reset the watch after I had put it in a draw for a few days.<br /><br />Then, I started wearing it all the time and that has made the difference. I like it better than more expensive watches I have because it is very light. And since it's light I don't mind wearing it all the time. Wearing it 24/7 means it stays wound and keeps good time. It does lose I would estimate 3 minutes in a week. But I can live with that. And there's a way to set the day/dates so that either spanish or english abbreviations always show - that's described in the manual that comes in the box.<br /><br />A good deal for a basic automatic watch that will probably last for many years.

1573229725|5.0|The depiction of Victorian life is incredibly rich and detailed, the plot is deep and complex, and the characters are wonderfully well drawn.<br /><br />But what impressed me most about this novel was the way in which the author uses structure and plot in harmony. I've sometimes read books in which the structure actually undermines the plot: the way in which the story is put together reveals information to soon (for example) so decreasing the mystery and tension. But Sarah Waters writing is a master class in how to use structure to strengthen the plot.<br /><br />The lesbian love affair at the centre of the story may be off putting to some, but I found myself so much in sympathy with the characters, and all they went through, that I could only be glad at the outcome.

B002APU580|3.0|I put the fault with Amazon on this one - why doesn't Amazon offer closed captioning?  I'm really surprised they can get away without it, since it's an ADA requirement, and the DVD version has the captioned version.<br /><br />(I'm not hearing impaired, but I find the accents difficult to understand, and rely on captions to help me.  Of course for someone who is hearing impaired, the captions wouldn't be a &#34;nice to have&#34; but necessary!  Get with it, Amazon!)
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|didn't think I would, but it grew on me.  Got hooked on it thanks to Netflix - by the time I finished watching all the episodes for Seasons 1 and 2, the 3rd season was half-over!  So I DVR'd the remaining episodes on commercial TV thinking Netflix would add it...nope...then I came across the DVD on Amazon !<br /><br />Received the DVDs, and watched the entire season in a 3 day blitz of The Walking Dead!!  I think if I was watching one episode a week Season 3 may have bored me as I read in others reviews - but watching each episode back-to-back like I did, it held my interest very well (obviously).

B000RO9VJK|5.0|This is a great book for aspiring small business people.  I think he rightly points out that most small businesses are started by technicians like plumbers, or programmers who get sick of working in a big organization and set up on their own, only to find out that plumbing or programming is allot different from running a plumbing or programming business.  Gerber's depiction of the problematic pattern that emerges is brilliant and unique as far as I am aware, and is well worth the read. However, his solution to this problem, to become like Macdonald's, is not as easy to implement as he makes it seem.

B00005JLR2|5.0|Looking at this movie, I can sort of understand why it flopped in theaters.  It's not typical Disney fare, seeing as Disney hasn't dabbled much in science fiction with their animated films (\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" and \\"WALL-E\\" are the only other examples I can think of).  It's also not as \\"cute\\" and child-friendly as other Disney films, it lacks memorable musical numbers, and as far as I know there have been no real breakout characters from it showing up in merchandise or the theme parks.  The fact that it debuted in theaters at the same time as several other popular franchise films (including Harry Potter, Star Wars, and the American release of \\"Spirited Away\\" by Disney itself) didn't exactly help matters, and it got practically lost in the shuffle.  Most people, even Disney fans, seem to dismiss it as a forgettable blip on the radar and one of the less impressive Disney films.<br /><br />For those who have dismissed this film without giving it a look, I encourage you to take the time to watch it.  It's one of Disney's better modern-day offerings, and is both visually impressive and quite heartfelt.<br /><br />Adapting Robert Louis Stevenson's classic \\"Treasure Island\\" with a futuristic twist, this film follows Jim Hawkins, the rebellious teenage son of an innkeeper who constantly finds himself at odds with the law and dreams of finding adventure and treasure among the stars.  When an artifact that turns out to be a starmap falls into his hands -- and results in his mother's inn being burned down -- he decides there's no better time to seek his fortune and decides to follow the map to the fabled Treasure Planet.  Accompanied by an old family friend, the intelligent but bumbling Dr. Doppler (voiced by the always delightful David Hyde Pierce), he sets sail through the stars in the company of the no-nonsense, tough-as-nails Captain Amelia and the crusty but good-hearted cyborg cook Long John Silver.  But when the crew of the ship turns out to be a band of pirates -- with Silver as their leader -- Jim must use all his wits and courage to save his friends, find Treasure Planet's riches (with the aid of the forgetful half-mad robot B.E.N., voiced by Martin Short), and get safely home.<br /><br />The look of this film is incredible, and the animators have done a fantastic job of melding traditional animation with CGI -- there are very few instances of the 3D animation clashing with the 2D.  I also enjoyed the blend of old-fashioned and futuristic in terms of the world of this movie -- the old-fashioned sailing ships that are still technologically advanced enough to sail through the stars, the energy pistols fashioned after muskets, and even the robotic refugee B.E.N. looking more clockwork-y than like anything out of Star Wars.  With \\"steampunk\\" and \\"cyber-punk\\" becoming more and more popular nowadays, it makes me wonder if this film wasn't ahead of its time, as the world it gives us feels very much like a steampunk fan's dream.<br /><br />The story, while familiar, has been updated somewhat for modern audiences, and while that can be a bad thing in many cases, it's done quite well here.  There are themes in this film that will resonate with kids and teens today, especially those coming from single-parent homes or who are dealing with their own challenges.  As a child of a single-parent home, I could identify with Jim feeling adrift in his life and seeking a father figure, even if it's one as unconventional as Silver.  And it's nice to find a film where even the villain isn't nearly as nasty as he appears.<br /><br />While not Disney's best offering to date, this is still a far better film than people give it credit for, and well worth watching if you're a Disney fan or enjoy a good steampunk-flavored tale.  And if it gets kids and teens reading the original \\"Treasure Island,\\" then so much the better.  Probably best for kids age 10 and up due to violence and some intense scenes.er as their leader -- Jim must use all his wits and courage to save his friends, find Treasure Planet's riches (with the aid of the forgetful half-mad robot B.E.N., voiced by Martin Short), and get safely home.<br /><br />The look of this film is incredible, and the animators have done a fantastic job of melding traditional animation with CGI -- there are very few instances of the 3D animation clashing with the 2D.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I gave this 3 stars because I can't decide if I liked it or not.  It was enjoyable enough, especially the parts describing the different tents in the circus, but something was just off about the entire book.  One part I found a bit annoying was the whole ring binding device used throughout the story.  Maybe I'm just tired of convenient things linking characters together, but I would have preferred that neither character be forced into one another like that...because that's what it felt like, forced.  Also I found the ending to be a complete cop out and way too, yet again, convenient.  The writing was good, but the author definitely excels more at describing locations and items that she does with character interactions.  All in all, it's an ok read, but nothing I'd recommend to my friends unless they brought up the name first...and even then they'd get this same wishy-washy response.  Read it if you're curious.  If you're on the fence, don't bother or borrow a copy from the library.

B007VDN1PA|1.0|I wanted to like this device.  I have hundreds, if not thousands, of negative film strips (missing many of the prints), and I wanted to archive, and possibly make small prints (4 x 6 of some favorites).  I even have all the negatives from our wedding photographer.  I decided to test this device with the wedding negatives, as the shots are well composed, tack sharp (focus), and well lit.<br /><br />The instructions were simple and straightforward, the device arrived packaged well, and complete with all parts.  I got it set up, and scanned one negative film strip onto an SD card.  I then popped the SD card into my computer, and pulled up the scanned images from the strip.  They were grainy, fuzzy, and of extremely poor quality.  EXTREMELY poor quality.  I tried again, using the 10MP setting, and again, poor result.  Slightly better than the 5MP setting, but *very* slight -- it was still quite poor, and not of the quality described in the product information, nor by some other reviewers.  The concept is super, but the result doesn't match the concept.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product, even though I really, really wanted to like it.  I either got a bad unit, or other reviewers are happy with a poor result.

B001EJGQTU|5.0|Robert McNamara is probably one of the best and brightest men who served our country. In this film he shows that sometimes that is not enough to reach the right decisions. We blundered into Vietnam without knowing much about the Vietnamese and blinded by knee-jerk anti-communism. Nearly 60,000 Americans and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese died needlessly because of that. We did the same thing in Iraq. McNamara does not agonize over past decisions but explains how they were made. We really need to pay attention.

0525425764|5.0|I grew up reading John Grisham books.  Now my son has the same opportunity.  We read this one together.<br /><br />Theodore Boone is the son of two attorneys.  He wants to be an attorney when he grows up.  And, though he is still a kid, he is already practicing law amongst his friends and even representing llamas in court.  In this third installment of this Young Adult series, John Grisham trumps Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  My son and I have read the first three books and we can't wait to read the fourth.  My son can't get enough of it and neither can the other kids at his school.  The library can't keep the several copies there in stock.<br /><br />In \\"Theodore Boone: The Accused,\\" young Boone finds himself on the wrong side of the law.  He gets to feel what it is like to be suspected by the police and, since they are convinced that he has committed the crime, it is up to him and his disbarred Bob Dylan-humming uncle to clear Theodore's name before it is too late.<br /><br />What I love first about the series is that you can't put it down.  Secondarily, it teaches legal process to kids in a truthful and fair way.  By fair, in this installment, the police who are normally the good guys are characterized as two jerks, my son's opinion.  It's a good lesson that just because the newspapers say someone is arrested does not mean that they are guilty and sometimes detectives want credit for wrapping up a case greater than they want delayed justice.  Just because someone is in uniform doesn't make them the good guy.  (My son and I kept waiting for the detectives to officially apologize for falsely maligning Theodore, but it never came.  That's when my son decided they were jerks.)<br /><br />John Grisham has made a career out of the legal mystery.  In fact, some say he created the genre.  I believe, when we are long gone, that what Grisham will be remembered for is Theodore Boone and creating a whole new generation of avid readers.  I've seen it in my son.  I've seen it in the other kids at my son's school.  I've seen it in myself.  These books are hot and, like a Disney film, they transcend numerous generations.  My opinion?

B003EYVXUU|5.0|There is a strange darkness to this movie. It is a predominantly quiet movie about a &#34;young&#34;  girl who is really a victim of a serious disorder, that is, she is a vampire. It is a very well acted movie with a haunting theme about a girl and a boy who enter into a symbiotic relationship where the weakness of each is a strength to the other. There are some graphic scenes of violence, when the girl is helplessly driven to &#34;feed&#34;. But even those scenes are carefully crafted and disturbingly realistic.

B005NQ94KS|4.0|If you've seen films like Forest Gump, you know what time-jumping in Hollywood is like.  This film specifically jumps from year to year in two people's lives, always landing on July 15th, the day they met, and looking in on how they are doing.  Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess star in this adaption of the best-selling novel and I have to say I enjoyed the chemistry between them, even when they were fighting.  I feel that this chemistry was what kept the film afloat as, given the length of the plot, others came and went throughout their lives, leaving the pair as the only constants.  If you're looking for a love story with a Disney-like plot complete with a happy ending and a horse, you'll be dissappointed.  Me, I'm the opposite.  I always enjoy a film that defies the stereotypical.  True, I was rooting for these two kids to make it, but this ending was far better and more powerful than I could have imagined (I won't say more as to not spoil it.)  And if you're a red-blooded American, you'll find this film interesting just based on the fact that it doesn't take place in the United States and therefore addresses little to none of our country's history...it's time to expand your minds.  But in the end, it's a solid film to be enjoyed, even if critics had problems with Anne Hathaway's accent.  Also, you'll see a Tex-Mex type resteraunt in the middle of London (gotta admit...didn't see that one coming.)

B004L3AR0K|5.0|A love story involving the development and, more specifically, the marketing of viagra...\\"interesting\\" does not begin to discribe it.  Though the role of a womanizer has been done time and time again, Jake Gyllenhaal) does not overdo it and therefore makes his performance more believible and makes an audience root for him in the end...I'm assuming that was a goal of the filmmakers here.  Anne Hathaway plays a \\"leading lady\\" who is anything but a stereotypical leading lady.  Though she and Gyllenhaal's characters hook up, she has a mind of her own and uses it, something always worth seeing.  I have no doubt that her trips to Canada with senior citizens for cheap perscription drugs are based on something real, given our health care system.  I personally love the fact that their relationship is anything but stereotypical...I mean, how many films have you seen that show a person having a panic attack during the same scene where they say \\"I love you\\"?  But ultimately, I enjoy the film's portrayal of someone with an incurrible illness and the challenges they face, including the possibility of a relationship so many today take for granted.  It's another one of those romantic comedies that stays down to Earth and shows us what is really possible if we want it bad enough.  I have to credit the actors for this, though I'm told the director did a fair amount of anicdotal things to help them accomplish their performances, so hats-off to Edward Zwick.  It's just one of those nice films to enjoy on a Friday or Saturday night with your loved one.  Just don't use viagra afterwards unless you really have to...there's a scene in the film that will explain why.  Otherwise, enjoy.

B000957O7S|4.0|I know it was always Paris that held the title of \\"The City of Love\\", but with this charming film, New York City could be a contender for the honor.  Too often, Hollywood delivers a beautiful love story that can leave an audience yearning for such feelings in our own lives.  But let's face it...how many of us will find ourselves on a giant sinking ship, members of warring families, or intellectually-challenged and living in Alabama?  Hitch shows another side of romance movies...a side that's quite possibly atainible.  Think about it, how many of us meet \\"the one\\" at work or on the street or at one of our usual routine stops?  That's just one factor that makes this movie worth watching.  Second is it's stars.  I'll readily admit that I would have never imagined Will Smith and Kevin James teaming up (they're both actors, but their resumes suggest very different types of work.)  After seeing this film, I'll readily admit I would have never imagined the paring working out so well.  These gentlemen seemed to be acting the most natural when they were interacting with each other that I almost forgot it was a movie...in fact, could someone show me a script for those scenes so I can just make sure?  Talk about chemistry.  Will Smith plays a \\"date doctor\\" whose advice I could certainly use and want and Kevin James plays a love-struck and rather nerdy pencil-pusher who anyone could relate to.  Playing off these gentlemen are Eva Mendes as a gossip columnist who brings respectibility to the profession and Amber Valletta as the socialite millionaire (or billionaire...I'm not quite sure...apparently her last boyfriend owned Sweden or something like that) who has her own insecurities.  This cast tells their story against one of the finest backdrops in the world, New York City.  Really, what other city would this really work in?  The location and the cast's talents make this a truely romantic story worth watching over and over again...this time, the feelings you're left with afterwards may very well be within your grasp.  Perhaps you should listen to Mr. Smith there.  Most of advice seems to be very sound...especially the advice he gives to one sleezy gentlemen played by Jeffrey Donovan (could he show me that move?).  There's just one thing that I'm not entirely thrilled about...it doesn't lose this film a star, but it does keep me up at night.  At one point, Will Smith's character believes that his real talent is simply giving guys like Kevin James's character the confidence to get the woman of their dreams and suggests that this is no big deal in the big picture that is a subsequent relationship.  I disagree...confidence is a huge part of it and I'd certainly like a \\"date doctor\\" to help me out in that department...and like I said, show me that move.ards may very well be within your grasp.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I mainly bought this to watch any video from internet not just youtube and netflix. I watch netflix thru my blue ray player which is good enough for me .<br />Anyway setup of the chromecast was quite easy . I was using a android device ( Samsung Galaxy Tab ) . Then I tried to cast from youtube. I had to download the latest version of youtube from google play store . Youtube casting sort of met my expectatons . The picture quality was pretty good .<br />Then I tried to cast from my chrome web browser on the device and the fun started. I found I need a google cast extension to chrome browser . I tried to download that extension and found that the OS of my device is not supported for this google cast extension. And I am running Android !!! So that is a big big surprise as google is not supporting its own OS . Anyway I went to my window laptop and started the process again ( download chromecast from google play, install chrome browser , install google cast)<br />Now I was ready to cast from chrome . I started with some news channels which show live tv . It was slow and jerky and sometime audio doesnot match video . Also the video plays in both my laptop and the tv thus probably contributing to bandwidth issues . Overall it is still not seamless to cast from chrome .<br />Other issues I came up with<br />1. For some reason when my laptop is connected to my office vpn it cannot connect to chromecast<br />2. I often use a  movie site that uses microsoft silverlight, so predictably this does not work chromecast<br />Overall I would say it is still a work in progress and hopefully google will continue to add other apps than youtube and netflix and it will continue to improve casting from chrome browser . and hopefully google will support it OWN OS Android very soon .<br />Overall this is not the worst $35 I have ever spent !!
B00947N6UG|5.0|A little bit frustrating at first, because of the name, which made me think it would have something to do with owls from the guardians. But none the less it was very enjoyable animation with an interesting plot.

0307744434|4.0|I had actually not intended to read this book, and I blame the way it was marketed. I thought it was a sweet, sweet, slightly girly romance fantasy that took place in a cute circus. It did not appeal to me. But people kept recommending it, and everyone just seemed to love it.<br /><br />I picked it up at an airport bookstore to go along with GRRM's Dance With Dragons in a 2-for-1 book deal that was going on. DWD was a bit heavy to start reading on a short plane ride, so I opened The Night Circus instead, and was immediately whisked away into a complete and detailed world of magic and intrigue. Sure, there is romance, but this is not a romance novel. It has often been compared to Susanna Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell, and I think it a fair comparison; both books are long and intricate, both books have interesting characters that perform magic, and both books are an absolute joy to read.<br /><br />The Night Circus really tells of a magical duel between Celia and Marco, neither of which is entirely sure how, or indeed who, exactly they are supposed to be duelling. They are both great users of magic, and unknowingly end up in the circus together. For a while everything is going well, and the circus travels the world and becomes famous. But all good things must end, and all duels end in death.<br /><br />Believe the hype, buy this book.

B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|I really appreciated his previous two books and wanted so much to like this but it frustrated  me the back and for from Main characters to secondary ones. I guess I wanted a mainly straight story line and this is not it. From past to present, to characters I didn't care about and other who disappear and who knows what happens to them. I wanted to know the story of the sister and brother and thus finished the book to find out. But skipped so much to get there. A disappointment for me.
B00CVE1SAO|4.0|I enjoyed the new character. He is significantly different from Baldacci's other primary characters. I found a few parts a little slow, but I am not the easiest person to please. Overall, the book is good and well worth the purchase price.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief tells the tale of Liesel Meminger, a girl who loses one family only to gain another. How she becomes dubbed The Book Thief. How she slowly gains an understanding of Germany and the Nazis and the wrongness of it all. How her family comes to hide a Jewish man, Max, in their basement despite all risks. And how Max transformed her life completely and defined her in a whole new light. It's a tale of sorrow and joy, of friendship and love, of bravery and acceptance.<br /><br />'I witness the ones that are left behind, crumbled among the jigsaw puzzles of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.'<br /><br />The Book Thief's use of Death as the narrator is not only thoroughly alluring in concept alone but it serves to utilizes dark humor to lighten the saddest of situations. Death is not the cold and emotionless specter you would expect him to be though. He's unintentionally humorous, and has a fascination for humans despite his awareness of his need to remain impartial. He seeks meaning in his work and becomes mesmerized by the interesting and courageous humans, Liesel being one of them.<br /><br />\\"...to prove to myself that you, and your human existence, are worth it.\\"<br /><br />The symbolism is rife within these pages. Most importantly is Liesel and her book thieving. She remains blissfully naive of what is truly going on in the world until April 20, 1940 when a book burning was organized in the town square to celebrate Hitler's birthday. She discovers things that greatly impact her and change her outlook on what has happened in her life up till that point and swiftly regards Hitler as her enemy. She steals a book from the pyre to mark the occasion. The book thieving continued after that but it wasn't just a bad childish habit, it became a symbol for her resistance to the Nazi regime and specifically to Hitler and all he had done. Each book stolen became a symbol of hope for a better future in the post-Holocaust world.<br /><br />I've only recently become drawn to stories of war, the majority of those I've read have been based around WWII, and The Book Thief is absolutely one of the very best. I loved that it was told from the point of view of a German sympathetic to the Jews which made it immediately different than any of the others I had read. Possessing richly drawn characters is what makes this story absolutely unforgettable. Liesel and Rudy, Hans and Rosa, and of course Max...their cumulative story will forever live on in my mind.<br /><br />The Book Thief is an emotional tale regarding the power of words and how that power can be used for good or bad, depending on how you choose to use them.aust world.<br /><br />I've only recently become drawn to stories of war, the majority of those I've read have been based around WWII, and The Book Thief is absolutely one of the very best.

B00E193TM2|5.0|....and sets it on fire and laughs as it burns down to its studs. Seriously, after several listens this is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums this year.<br /><br />Wrong Side has been constructed very well, with guest vocalists Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed and Tech N9ne. Lift Me Up is an excellent opening track that starts the album off with a bang, and Halford's sound is as solid as ever in this track. Wrong Side of Heaven is a little slower in tempo, but carries some of Ivan Moody's most inspired vocals. Though Burn MF may be more what people want to hear, (a little repetitive and mindless for me, but still not bad) it's on the title track, and others like it, that I feel he really shines.<br /><br />I.M.Sin is another knockout song with fast guitar licks and excellent visceral vocals, and Dot Your Eyes, though it sounds kinda corny on the first couple of listens, doesn't fail to get me pumped. The cover of Mama Said Knock You Out is unexpected, but welcome, and Tech N9ne helps give a little bit of legitimacy to a metal band covering a rap song. The album truly ends with Diary of a Deadman, a song featuring excellent downtempo guitars and Moody, not screaming or singing, but speaking the vocals as if literally reading from a diary aloud. A departure from their usual work, but a fine effort.<br /><br />After Diary, the album repeats what it perceives as its three heavist hitters with guest vocals: I.M.Sin with Max Cavalera (en Español), Anywhere but Here with Maria Brink, and Dot Your Eyes featuring Jamey Jasta. From start to finish, Wrong Side (volume 1) is an exceptional Deathpunch album, and I can't wait until later this year when volume 2 drops.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|&#34;What we have here is, a failure to communicate&#34;. Classic movie, classic cast. Great story. Very engrossing. I loved it!

B00EOO55GW|5.0|Hail to the King was meant to draw inspiration from the Pantheon of Metal, imitating the sound of such bands as Metallica, Judas Priest, Motley Cr&uuml;e and Black Sabbath. The result was a sound that either pays great homage or quite simply carbon copies the bands that they drew inspiration from. Knowing A7X like I do, having listened to them faithfully since City of Evil, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. All eleven songs produced for Hail to the King are solid, and though I am sad to see Portnoy leave the lineup, Arin Ilejay is a fantastic technical drummer and his work is excellent in this album.<br /><br />Shepard of Fire begins slowly, with a crackling fire that seems content to burn slowly, as if from a nearby string of steel drums with a homeless person warming his hands. The guitar and orchestra come in slowly, and once Ilejay starts his deliberate pounding on those bass and floor toms and the licks begin on the guitar, it's difficult to stop banging your head.<br /><br />The title track has an insane riff that continues through the entire song, riding that e string the whole way. The pace of the song itself is much slower, though no less intense than Shepard. Doing Time seems to be this albums Blinded in Chains or Danger Line, a heavy hitting masterpeice that lets M. Shadows' vocals compete with the feirce guitar work of Synyster Gates. This Means War is the first slow song on the album, but its a deliberate measured tempo that isn't afraid to shred just as hard as the surrounding work.<br /><br />Requiem comes off as biblical, with the chants in Latin at the beginning and towards the end of the song, and its measured cadence comes with sosme of Shadows' best vocals on the album. Coming Home features Papa Gates on the guitar, performing the outro solo as only he can do. The rest of this songs, while solid, are unremarkable, content to blend in with the rest of the album rather than stand out and make themselves be heard.<br /><br />Saint James, the bonus downloadable song included with the limited edition of Hail to the King, is (I assume) another tribute to James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan, but not a touching, down-tempo tribute like So Far Away was. It keeps in line with the rest of the album, another example of how to pay respect to the Old Gods of Rock, named for the Rev.<br /><br />(( foREVer ))<br /><br />In short, Hail to the King is a prime example of what A7X does best, and is quite possibly one of their heavier-handed albums to date. Though the technical guitar can be heard here, this album is more content to grind the E and A strings with most of the technical musicianship being left to Ilejay on the drums. Still a very solid, pulse pounding album, and an excellent tribute to old school rock.
B0000ACY0Y|4.0|On of the best albums I have heard in a long time.  Don't know how I missed this album when I was younger.  I give it a 4.5 rating and highly recommend it.
0743454537|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in a very long time! I had seen the movie first, and was told by friends that I must read the book. I didn't even know there was a book! Now I understand why people were so disappointed in the movie.<br /><br />Wow! What an emotional read this was! For the first 9/10 of the book, we're taken on an emotional roller coaster; each chapter eliciting a completely different emotion than the chapter before it. There was hardly enough time to be angry, because the next chapter was sad. Right on the heels of that sad chapter, you were laughing. Then you got to feel warm fuzzies. Then you were angry again. Then shocked. Then happy, and right back to angry. I wasn't capable of much more than a minute of each emotion before I was dumped headfirst into the next emotion.<br /><br />There were so many more elements to this story than I expected after watching the movie. The marital tension between Brian and Sara. The GAL was a pleasant surprise, and her interpersonal relationships were great! Jesse was the biggest shock of them all.<br /><br />In the end, I was so overcome, I had to stop reading because I couldn't see through the tears, nor could I hold the book steady because I was wracked with violent sobbing and unexpected grief.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey with my Prime membership.  I had been wanting to see them prior to the 4th season because so many people were telling me about it.<br />The characters were great and the story lines held my attention.

0451532082|4.0|A real part of American history that is a lovely story of traditional family values. Part One is a bit too sweet but Part Two is more for mature readers.It was read by every woman I know  when they were in their teens to good purpose but ,as an old guy ,I truly enjoyed it.

B006ANJ4BW|4.0|Never read the comics, so I do not care what the fanboys say, this was a well-done B Movie, beautifully photographed in Eastern Europe. It has the right amount of blood, beheadings and other body parts chopped off being chopped off, a wry Jason Momoa as<br />Conan (&#34;You scream like a girl&#34;), an over-the-top Stephen Lang as the bad guy, and SCARY Rose McGowan as his sorceress daughter. Some of the &#34;deaths&#34; were pretty creative--the key swallowing and the catapult being two, and they both made me laugh at the excessiveness of it all. Say what you will, but there are WAYYYY worse movies than this one in the genre, and this one kept me<br />engaged to the outrageous end.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I used to be a prime member but saw no difference worth the price of membership. Also today I am fed up with difficulty to contact them about issues because again I purchased additional free spins.. paid for six and only received three of them.  I just wanted to warn everyone before spending money in Bingo Blitz!!!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I rented this movie instead of buying it.  If I owned a copy, I would watch again.  I have quite a collection of TV series and movies and I will probably  end up buying a copy  of this one to add to my collection, so I can watch it again at a later date.<br /><br />I thought it was kind of refreshing considering so many movies are so involved now.  I enjoyed being able to sit and relax and watch it without a lot of constant aggressive action going on all at once.  I realize everyone's taste is different, but I wouldn't have any problem recommending it.<br /><br />Update...I did go ahead and buy this.  IMO, worth watching more than just once.  At the great price I paid couldn't pass it up.
B00003CXBK|5.0|With its incredible story telling and its fantastic cast of voice actors Princess Mononoke has become my all-time favorite movie.  I have watched it countless times and it never gets old.  The story does a great job of capture the struggle between mankind and nature.  I wish there had been more special features but even so this is still a must buy just for movie itself.

B00BOXZAG6|2.0|Just thought you might like to know that, if you didn't already.<br /><br />Some stories are not meant to be told on the big screen.  They are too convoluted, detailed and heavy handed.  You can usually tell right off the bat which films these are.  About ten seconds into `Upside Down' I told my wife that Juan Solanas was trying too hard and that this story would be better suited for a video game.  When you have to introduce your movie through voiceover by explaining rules to understanding your story then you know you're off to a bad start.<br /><br />`Upside Down', conceptually, is pretty interesting, but the first half is somewhat of a chore to get through and the simplistic afterthought of a love story becomes somewhat sketchy as Solanas starts breaking his own `rules' and pretty much throws his entire introduction out the window.<br /><br />Why do you have to make things so complicated only to lazily uncomplicated them?<br /><br />The story tells that of a poor kid named Adam who falls in love with a rich girl named Eden.  The `Romeo + Juliet' doomed relationship / Adam + Eve beginnings of creation aspects of this film are in full swing, and it becomes obvious by the films end that Juan Solanas is a dreamer and he wants us to be too.  I'm cool with that, to an extent.  Here's the trick, Adam and Eden cannot be together, not simply because Adam is deemed inferior and it is forbidden but because they physically cannot be together.  They live on twin worlds that are held together by dual gravity and so Adam walks on land beneath (or above depending on how you look at it) Eden.  Adam (or should I say, Jim Sturgess) explains all this in the intro and quite frankly it is tedious and complicated and, as I mentioned, was trying too hard.  The basic point is that if Adam goes to Eden's world he'll start to burn up and die.<br /><br />Still, they meet as children in this place where their worlds come together and they form a relationship only to have a tragic accident separate them for years.  Adam is determined to be with Eden, no matter the cost, and quite frankly that cost could be his life.<br /><br />Alright, the plot is thin, despite all the complicated details.  As I mentioned, Juan Solanas (who wrote and directed the film) is determined to create something unique and then he spends the better part of the second half of the film trying to skirt around his own creation.  The `burning up' aspect of transferring to the other world is a big hole in this plot because the time frame surrounding the `burning' seems to change every time Adam goes over.  One time he starts to burn after a few minutes, the next time hours, the next time it's almost like he never burns.  Then you have the `plot within a plot' regarding conjoining their gravity, which is interesting but underdeveloped.<br /><br />Couple this with the fact that the film feels about twice as long as it really is, and you have a bad thing.<br /><br />But there is good here.<br /><br />Set aside the poor scripting, the underdeveloped plot and the lackluster acting (why is Jim Sturgess squandering his potential by continuously playing the lovelorn Romeo?) and you have a richly textured fantasy world that is mind-blowing in execution.  I'm serious when I say that these graphics are the best I've seen in film in YEARS, maybe ever.  The dual worlds, hanging above (and below) one another are seamlessly created and strung before us, and the visual depth of these sequences are astounding.  In fact, the whole technical side of this film, from the sets to the score to the beautiful cinematography are near perfection.  I've never wished so badly that a film was better than it was, because I'd love to look at it again and yet the idea of watching it a second time makes me anxious.arate them for years.

One time he starts to burn after a few minutes, the next time hours, the next time it's almost like he never burns.  Then you have the `plot within a plot' regarding conjoining their gravity, which is interesting but underdeveloped.<br /><br />Couple this with the fact that the film feels about twice as long as it really is, and you have a bad thing.<br /><br />But there is good here.<br /><br />Set aside the poor scripting, the underdeveloped plot and the lackluster acting (why is Jim Sturgess squandering his potential by continuously playing the lovelorn Romeo?) and you have a richly textured fantasy world that is mind-blowing in execution.  I'm serious when I say that these graphics are the best I've seen in film in YEARS, maybe ever.  The dual worlds, hanging above (and below) one another are seamlessly created and strung before us, and the visual depth of these sequences are astounding.  In fact, the whole technical side of this film, from the sets to the score to the beautiful cinematography are near perfection.  I've never wished so badly that a film was better than it was, because I'd love to look at it again and yet the idea of watching it a second time makes me anxious.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|When it makes correct guesses it amazing how it got it in such few questions however, after a number of plays the game glitches - only play a few at a time, shut down and try playing again a little later.
B000M341QE|5.0|I loved The Departed. Loved all the actors and the movie itself was well directed. I had to smile to hear some of the struggle to drop the r's and stretch out the a's.  It's made for a better movie having locals and Boston made stars in it.  Saw the movie twice and had to buy it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the show, the the characters and the storyline.  They are able to have an over-arching story throughout multiple episodes alongside stories and cliff hangers within each episode.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard trumps the default keyboard for most phones. It's really great at predicting you relies. I'm in high school so I use some uncommon words when talking about a insects so sometimes apple doesn't work full well with me,  but for the most part it is very good and customizable
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|Just the right blend of intrigue and suspense. Baldacci has done it again. Once started you cannot put it down.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you haven't seen this episode, you MUST!!  Imagine, a TV show about monsters, vampires, and the high school students who fight them suddenly singing, dancing and having an entire episode as a musical!  Now, imagine if the songs were actually really good and well-done and, instead of having the actors dubbed or auto-tuned, it's their real voices and it sounds really good.  That's exactly what this episode was!!<br /><br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone who loved the show, anyone who likes musicals, and encourage anyone who hasn't seen this episode to watch it and then get the CD!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I don't have cable, most of my tv viewing is through Netflix so this is great for me.<br />Casting off the PC works OK, but not great, depending on what your trying to cast. Netflix and YouTube cast very well from the PC.<br />I am hoping that amazon and others will get on the list. Its really handy to be able to use my droid phone and tab to use as a remote.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love, love, love this movie. There is nothing disappointing in it whatsoever. It makes my mom feel like she can kick some ass.
B005544TRQ|5.0|love it.... wish there were more seasons or other ones like it here.. i.e. Franklin and Bash or the new hawaii-5-O.
B00138EWJI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to the recording of SANTANA III. It takes back to my younger days when I was introduced to the music of SANTANA !!
B00BF11STU|4.0|I enjoyed it, perhaps not as much as the earlier Seal Team Six, but far more than the Argo winner that year.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I have seen a lot of zombie movies. After the 20th one I thought, okay zombie movies are officially boring. However I decided to give World War Z a chance. I just finished watching this and I must say my heart is still pounding. This has great graphics, beliveable zombies and situations. This definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. I was actually scared and it made me think that this could happen one day! very scary! Brad Pitt is great in this as well, he knows how to move an audience. Definitely give this a chance like I did! Watch it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The critics are right. This is, in fact, one of the best television series ever. Absolutely not to be missed!
B001974DG0|5.0|If you haven't read this book you must read it!  This is an oldie of Koontz, I read this a long, long time ago, but I have gotten my whole family to read this book.  If you are an animal lover you will love this story, especially because it has a highly intelligent dog in it.  One of my sons read this book twice.  And the other son, who has never read a book in his life (seriously, he is a jock! Not knocking jocks, that's just him!)  just read it in less than a week.  If anyone ever asks for a recommendation I always say &#34;Have you read The Watchers?&#34;  READ IT!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Best game of this type that I've played, the tools that are included make playing the game more enjoyable. You always see the light at the end of the tunnel so giving up is not on your mind
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I enjoyed the unrated expanded version of World War Z.  Brad Pitt was great as usual and James Badge Dale as Captain Speke gave me another reason to find the movie so intriguing....oh the possibilities!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The book is better, which is no surprise.  But if you're not a reader, you'll probably love this moving.  Disturbing, but good.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|o,ld star trek too talkie. new star trek great action, but still retains interesting story line. la, la, la. ok.
B005BX3NAA|1.0|At number ten it started skipping, and none of the rest of the CD worked. It sucks because it started skipping on November rain, which is one of my favorite songs.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|My boys and I read the book, which was very disturbing, so I was worried about letting my 5-year-old watch this film.  Overall, everyone enjoyed it.  It was colorful, entertaining, and just the right amount of spooky for my 8 and 11 year old boys.  Eventually I let my 5-year-old watch it too (during the day) and she had no problems with the scary parts.  She was also too young to understand what exactly was going on, but for older children you better be prepared to have a lengthy discussion about death and the afterlife.<br />As for myself, it was kind of silly-weird, but I enjoyed watching it.<br />****SPOILER ALERT*****<br />Coraline finds the remains of three children who have been kidnapped, disfigured, and murdered inside her house.  They are unable to pass away properly because the beldam has eaten their eyes and hidden their souls.  Coraline must find their eyes (in the book it was their souls) before they can escape.
B001YB29HG|5.0|The music is memorable (Commentary reminds me a little of Billy Barns Review), show is funny, and actors are lovable, in a &#34;horrible&#34; sort of way.
B001N4RORE|2.0|I think this is a great, feel good moving that I can watch over and over again with my girls so I purchased it but the viewing quality is pretty poor.<br />Luckily the sound quality is good since it is all about the music!
B005NPBT5M|5.0|Wow!  What talent!  This has a &#34;Jesus Christ Superstar&#34; vibe to it.  There's a mixture of hard rock, broadway, and ballads intertwined in this crazy story.  I can almost picture the scenes as I listen the music.  I can see why this was banned.  It definitely paints a dislike of what was going on politically in that area of the world.  The most emotional envoking song is the song, &#34;The Trial.&#34;  Listen to it, and tell me that that doesn't sound like Judas selling his soul to the Romans!  Obviously differently songs, but the vibe you get from the score is sooo similiar!<br /><br />Also, I didn't know there were 3 Another Brick on the Wall versions.  On the other hand, it feels almost like sniplets, so I'd recommend the more expensive version because it may have the &#34;full&#34; version of many of the songs.  This one feels really edited.  The music is 5 stars, but the editing is 4 stars.
B008469DGY|5.0|When I need something to keep me busy this is the game I go to.  Very fun.  Not too easy and sometimes a little too hard but it is really fun!
0812971825|4.0|Strout seems always to succeed marvelously w/ character development.  Although I thought this was not quite as good as &#34;Olive K&#34; and &#34;Amy and Isabel&#34; or even &#34;Burgess Boys,&#34;  I truly grieved for the 5 year old daughter - who became the main character for me.  Yet the minister was empathetic and I loved despising his petty un-Christ-like parishioners.
B003ELKNH2|3.0|i think francis ford coppola did a fine job, not much i can say about the movie, but , thank you
B004X80QNG|3.0|I attempted to use on my tablet and my phone, but it doesn't sync the information that i put on one device with the other!
B00915G6R6|5.0|Have  enjoyed all seasons of show. Great acting. Jul. Mar. is a great actress. Enjoyed her on ER. Hopefully this show will go on for years to come.
B005LAII80|5.0|Hard to explain just how awesome this movie is. It's pure fun in it's finest form. A level of awesome very rarely reached, but surpassed by Dredd!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Awesome CD.. Not much of a C&W fan, but this CD kicks butt, maybe it's because the band doesn't look C&W.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|this little game is a head turner, and it is fun! When I am bored and don't have too much time to kill, it's a great game to play!
0061122416|5.0|I just couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I identified with the central character from the onset of his journey.  It was as if our despair, desperation and dreams were of similar nature.  I wanted to see the buried treasure of Santiago's great expectation uncovered through every hardship he encountered; believing if it was possible for him it was possible for me.  You are throwing away \\"riches\\" walking away without taking the journey of this adventuresome read![[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]
B001AMVN3U|5.0|Offspring never get old and keep getting better and better! I have been listening to their music since their first album.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|I have no words to explain why I thinks it's okay,just like to take time to relax and play a game on my kindle.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Usual good plot with wonderful twists and turns.  Amazing what clues exist that are factual in Washington DC.  Buy it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It was interesting how someone turns out because of their surrounds.  I was not ready for the book to end.
1452126607|5.0|It was great. Love it !!!! pictures are beautiful .........grumpy lovers need to get this  you will not be sorry!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Story of teenagers with cancer, adapting to their conditions, coping with their disease. Very good dialogue between the teens, showing how fatal disease can re-define for teens what is important in life. I enjoyed the main character's critical examination of Mosley's hierarchy, the intellectual conversation between the teenagers, and the illustration of teenagers' ability to see through hypocrisy. I know that John Green is an adult, but his teenaged characters' abilities did not exceed reality. Worthwhile read for any generation. I read the book after my grandson, 15 years old, recommended it to me.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is my favorite album of the year. Lyrical, disco, classical, techno fusion! Disco/dance artists and Techno masters is such a great mix. First time I heard it, it was an interesting back in time feel; but after the 3rd listening I was just hooked and taken on a musical journey. Great album from the French duo!
0307352153|5.0|Why was there such a boom in eloquence and public speaking during the 20th century? Why was the Wall Street crash so profound and far-reaching? How many people actually saw it coming? The answers to all these questions and more lie within the pages of this thoroughly-researched, interesting and incredibly readable tome.<br /><br />The invention and propagation of television, radio and Dan Carnegie's public speaking courses certainly had a strong impact on the extrovert ideal. As recent research has shown, however, extroverts have a particular affinity with certain types of subordinates, while introverts thrive in different situations. High-powered, energetic, enthusiastic and vivacious extroverts can easily rouse, motivate and engender higher productivity in individuals who are passive and respond well to external instruction and encouragement. Introverts deal well with creative, independent and self-motivated teammates (as long as they make their leadership known and respected). Able to keep ideas and discussions on track, they can prevent the bubbly energy of overzealous contributors from evaporating away on irrelevant tangents.<br /><br />Any group situation, however well-oiled and cohesive, is also vulnerable to three fatal flaws - the inability for more than one member to contribute at once (which is not present in online crowdsourcing/email alliances), the likelihood of laziness and passing the buck to emerge, and the trepidation of peer pressure stifling creative and lateral thinking.<br /><br />The extrovert ideal is also conspicuously absent in Asian cultures, where silence and deference are par for the course, expected as displays of respect. Self-study and focus on subjects is seen as the ultimate teamsmanship, a dutiful contribution to society as a whole. And this is perhaps where the most pronounced difference between extroverts and introverts come into play. While extroverts desire to resolve problems through asserting their position, introverts desireto avoid conflict where possible, and tend to withdraw into their shells if faced with a bellowing extrovert three feet from them. This leads to the extrovert feeling as though their introverted partner is not taking them seriously, while the introvert is further intimidated, timorously curling up further and unable to articulate their interests, objections or even points of agreement with the other party. Put simply, they are like a cobra who has not only been defanged, but has lost his or her voice, unable to hiss and stand up for their interests.<br /><br />Overdoing a pseudo-extroverted persona can lead to mental stress and even physical health (catching double pneumonia without realising it isn't fun for anyone), and it would be an interesting experiment to see how the reverse impacts an extrovert. How will socialising differently, with fewer people (but on a deeper level with each), change the way they look at life? Will they see it as a breath of fresh air, spice to excite their social lives, or will they see it as simply too draining, the way many introverts see dinner parties at tables for twenty?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very well written book set in an incredibly detailed world that will send you on an emotional rollercoaster! Not the most uplifting, but very thrilling and will leave you excited to read the next books in the saga. On to Shift!
B0019IB0II|5.0|Helps you see what you have right now, how not to be afraid of any kind of future. Worth your time, attention and money.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this show.  Very quick and witty dialogues.  Nuanced and surprising  personal interactions.  Never know quite what to expect out of any given episode, their responses and resolutions of problems are not formulaic.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|The Good Wife has an intriguing  storyline to keep you  involved and characters  that draw you in.  Leaves you wanting more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not one for sci-fi stuff but this was an awesome book. Easy to.read very well.written. I already have others reading. Now on th steel and dust
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The signature tune &#34;Sugar Man&#34; and &#34;I Wonder&#34; are wonderful. Some of the rhymes really don't work and remind one of Paul Simon, but overall Rodriguez here is on a par with Bob Dylan, although with a mellower, less grating voice.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Way too boring for me, but there are probably a lot of people that will love it. I get bored with simple games easily though.
B00001W9G0|5.0|This is a replacement for my VHS version.  Wonderful movie; I will watch it many times.  I don't have four more words.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|Such a cute plot! The Bridgerton series made me think I was over Julia Quinn. No matter how much I liked the Bridgerton family, I greatly disliked the heroes. I had written the whole series off, but a friend recommended reading this one before completely calling it quits.<br /><br />Penelope, the eternal wallflower, has spent years in love with Colin, her best friend's older brother. Previously, Colin emphatically stated his disinterest in Penelope. But, as Penelope starts letting her guard down and speaking her mind, Colin begins seeing her in a different light.<br /><br />It was great watching Penelope come to terms with herself and she really shines. With the quick engagement, I was worried there was going to be the standard \\"you have to say you love me for it to count\\" conflict. But, there wasn't. Hooray! It did feel like the story was over far too quickly. But, that might have been because of the headache inducing garbage I was reading before this book.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|I bought this CD after viewing &#34;Searching for Sugar Man.&#34; Most of the tunes have something interesting to say, but I found the orchestration (arrangement?) a bit heavy-handed and distracting.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive.  I have gotten my family addicted to it. We think it is a blast!
B000LXQVA4|4.0|It's a really good jumper. Entertains my baby for a while...he just gets easily bored. My only complaint is that I wish it were easier to place my baby in the seat (his feet can never get through the holes the first go around) and haul around from room to room. Other than that, it's a great toy that I'm sure he will learn to love just like all his other toys that he gets bored with initially and then later becomes infatuated with.
031620157X|5.0|Reading this with my nephew.  After about chapter 3, we got sucked in.  Great book for bonding time, or just for fun unwinding reading.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Rodriguez never made it onto the radar screens of Americans in the 1970s--perhaps because of his name (Bob Zimmerman, after call, became Bob Dylan) and assumptions about Latin music. He wasn't promoted well either. And his songs are edgy, in a Dylanesque way. But R has a better voice. The documentary traces his resurrection to an unlikely place--apartheid-era South Africa where R's music was a hit, even though listeners there knew nothing about him and even presumed him dead. His rediscovery and triumphant and moving return to music are chronicled in this film much like a detective story. Great cinematography with a wonderful vocal background.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Lots of fun, can't stop reading! Good for relaxing and distract from busy life, like a good movie but slowly going through.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|Really enjoy plainying this game it is à good chalange. It is à very relaxaing exercise. My four year old granddauther<br /><br />Is à  champ.
B00701897I|5.0|My wife grew up reading the adventures of Tintin so we had to have this movie when it came out in 3D.  The 3D is excellent and if you like Tintin stories you'll enjoy it.  If you're not already a Tintin fan it's more likely to appeal to youngsters than adults.  It's a good adventure yarn but you'll want to read some movies reviews to see if the story will appeal to you.<br /><br />The package includes a 3D Blu-ray disk, a 2D Blu-ray disk, and a DVD.  They play just fine, the image quality is excellent, and the 3D effects are very well done.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Did not know what to expect from this movie but we loved it. It was a little different and a little hard to follow at times but in the end it was well worth watching.  I highly recommend this movie.  Enjoy
B001FVMIWQ|5.0|We've had this on CD for years, picked up this vinyl to add to our collection of favorites!<br />Great for a chill afternoon.
B002APU580|5.0|Love, Love, Love this movie!! It has everything and it's Jane Austen's book brought to life in a beautiful and magnificent way. The cinematography is like a baroque painting and yet the characters seem real and you forget that your watching a period movie because the actors are so convincing in their roles. It's a gem and always gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I watch it.
B008602KQI|1.0|Or, keep &#34;Running, Man&#34;!<br />I suppose each generation must ponder the weighty issues of totalitarianism (snore), sacrifice (snooze), and loss of freedom (zzzz), and as for fleshing out these weighty issues on the big screen, well, may the odds ever be in your favor...
B00F2362IE|4.0|I love this game but there are a couple of thing that are kinda annoying. sometimes it pause while I'm playing or glitches. it sometimes takes forever to load other time it doesn't.  my son loves it too.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|this game can be addictive and you can play for hours without realizing where the time went i bought the full edition
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Well, it's my favorite book and my favorite actor, Leonardo DiCaprio; how could it go wrong? Somehow it went terribly wrong, the acting was over the top and the sets were over the top and the directing was over the top and I get that this was a Baz Lurhman production but he could've wowed us in a different way. Show us a different directing style Baz, go out on a limb and do someting with a little less pizzazz. I don't believe he captured the essence of the story or of the era, but the costumes and make up were great.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It was a good look into the world of foster children, and just how all the moving from family to family can effect a personality for good and for bad.  Wish some of the genteel qualities of Victorian life would permeate our current world.  The thought that what can change a persons life can be as simple as picking the correct flower is a wonderful idea!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This is a two hour escape from reality with a healthy dose of pyrotechnics provided by an assembly of just about every action hero of the last 35 tears. Great fun.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is fun but had an issue with the update it reset my game back to level one by  other than that I love this game
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Whenever I'm feeling down or blue, I watch this movie and suddenly I'm in a better mood. It's hilarious still after all of these years and Iove the scene in the church with James Brown as the minister but it's not as good as the car chase scene thru the mall, too funny!!
1401937268|5.0|These Angel Tarot cards are very easy to use. They are beautiful, wonderful artwork and pictures! You will enjoy using them and they are wonderful as a gift!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish it had more than 10 levels available..  I canot find the next level on line or in the apps store
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Very enjoyable movie.  Good interaction action with actors and the special effects were realistic.  Good family movie to help children realize the importance of helping each other.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What can I say? Signing up for Prime on Amazon was totally worth it just to be able to watch all of the Downton Abbey Seasons! I absolutely love watching this show and following the characters thru the twists and turns of the early 20th century in England. It embodies everything a good drama should have, at times it's funny, sad, touching, thought provoking, amusing, and it leaves you wanting more.<br />It's also something that the whole family can watch without being embarrassed in front of your kids or having to turn the channel. It takes you back to a simpler time and yet you see that people had to handle some of the same issues as we have today. Highly recommended if you love period drama.
1490313370|5.0|James Altucher offers a practical philosophy for building a successful, fulfilling life around. No self-help or new-age mumbojumbo, just a unique yet contrarian worldview for you to consider.
B00EI6E17A|2.0|After all of the hype regarding Gaga's new album this certainly was not what I was expecting and I'm a keen fan of hers. She just seems to have lost her magic touch when it comes to her music as this song just isn't relatable in the slightest and seems like a cheap imitation of artists like Bowie, Grace Jones and Madonna. Nothing new here people. Repetitive and boring. Applause applause applause. I'd have more fun reading a dictionary. Save your money and spend it on Work Bitch by Britney instead you get a lot more beat for your buck :)
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Well I think It would be easier to review this game if I could actually play it. However the game doesn't come up in my APPS  so I can't review the game.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|A unique game with it's own flavor! A game that would be great for a phone with a stylus like the GN 2!
B004811PMO|5.0|this is my all time most favorite Rodgers and Hammerstein. They are my favorite songs. And rod stieger singing and dancing is a hoot.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I PLAY ALL THE TIME.I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE NEW THINGS THAT HAPPEN EACH DAY. LOTS OF FUN!MUST TRY IT!
B003HV0TN2|4.0|Good story but slow start and abrupt end. I look forward to reading the next one but I understand the third isn't published yet which is a shame.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is fast, easy, and I love it.  Anyone can use Google.<br />Research inputs return pretty good results on topics of interest to me.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It's great for adults, easy to handle and it doesn't take up much room, easy to put in your purse and not expensive
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very entertaining, good story but also interesting to understand the lawyers' and politics world in the US. Great Chicagoland setting.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I rented through the Amazon Video and this is not an ordinary 'PG' Star Trek movie.  It's much darker than the previous movies and the Star Trek Tv shows.<br />  I was thrilled that Benedict Cumberbatch (from Sherlock TV series) was going to be in the movie but he's cleverly disturbing character to decipher, not at all like his version of Sherlock character he does so well - because there is a point when you sympathize with him but he turns around and does something truly evil.  You don't know what to expect from him.  I don't want to give away too much but there are shocking bits.  A lot of action and explosive scenes throughout but a warning for parents - *spoiler alert - I was a little shocked <winced> when Khan kills Peter Weller's character Admiral Marcus with his bare hands.  A little too brutal for any kids watching, I practically looked away myself.  If you know it's coming... you'll know when you see it.<br />  I was disturbed a little after that and how would they cope when a main-character dies - I'm not saying who dies only that it's not Spock.  The ending was predictable once you figured out where the plot was going but it leaves an opening later for Khan's return in future.  I watched it again, skipping over Marcus' murder and felt a bit better toward Cumberbatch's performance.
0062119044|2.0|Just really couldn't follow the format where the book is essentially the mother just writing her estranged husband letters after the fact.  I really don't like that method of writing and returned the book to the library unread.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is a great movie! Lots of action and a decent storyline. There were some great scenes with effects in slow motion too. I really like Karl Urban as an actor in this, he really portrays Judge Dredd's gritty take no prisoners attitude! I highly recommend this movie.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This move is so much better the the rotten tomato rating. A must see! do not rent, buy buy buy!
3836538725|3.0|The problem with the book is that, although high quality printed, The portrait orientation obligates most of the images to be spread across two pages, and that kills the visual appreciation. A landscape book would have been a much better rendition. There are so much images in this orientation that I don't know why they chose the vertical format. Also, there are so many beautiful photos in a very small print on the page folds that I would have paid for two volumes instead of one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, full of plot line twists. A real page turner and I could not put it down. Some people did not like the ending but I thought it was right. I highly recommend it!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I finally saw this movie based on a recommendation.  I am not into designer clothing so I was never interested in reading the book or seeing the movie. Well, I enjoyed the movie. MS was outstanding. Loved the ending.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has become one of my very favorite, if not favorite, authors. His world building is magnificent. This book is possibly my favorite yet. You never have to worry about poor grammar and editing in his books either. Thank you editors! Every one of Sanderson's books are uniquely creative. I always feel as if I am reading a fresh new imaginative story line. The Way of Kings is epic in proportion and complex in nature. Sanderson always throws in questions of philosophy and ethics in his story lines that help you grow in your thinking as you read an amazing novel. The very best type of book is one that encourages you to think about the nature of humanity and ponder questions of right and wrong, honor and justice, while completely entertaining you. The only down side is the understandable length of time between book publishing it takes to create books of this caliber. However, all of Sanderson's fans will of course wait on baited breath for the next installment of the Stormlight Archive and I am sure the wait will be well rewarded.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw this fellow playing this at the airport. I had to get it. It is a lot of fun and very addictive. I love the big dots. On my iPod the dots were wat too small.On the Kindle the size of the dots rock.

B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played you should buy it it's mobile and no Internet needed to play!!!!I rate minecraft five stars buy it now!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I loved this book but I think it was mostly because am a geek who grew up in the 80's. I suspect the tale would hold less appeal for anyone much younger or older. I didn't get all of the references but I did get many and that was a lot of the fun. Not particularly original tale as far as the characters go, girl, boy, best friend, mentor. I won't spoil it but if you have any fondness for pixelated games and synthesizer music, you should read this. Loved the haptic chair idea.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Great series!
0061124958|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book as a child and was even more elated to share with my children... A really good story about responsibility and life.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book is fun, with characters you know. It is great for down time reading when you just need a distraction from the world around you. For most of us, murder isn't on our daily schedule but we are stressed by life. Reading about the problems of Nikki and her team took me away from the things I had to deal with for just a little while. That made it easier to go back. Distraction of the best kind!
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|If I rated this on looks, it would be 5 stars, but the version I have is very buggy at times, so I don't play it much.  But my daughter likes it.

0802473156|5.0|Easy to read and to comprehend the meanings of each of the five love languages. My husband and I each found areas that led to better understanding of our spouse,s love/emotional needs and how to make that person feel more loved and cared for. We also discovered weaknesses in which we had no clue what our partners needs were - discussions between the two of us about the book and what our indivual needs were is in absolute must.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really fun....make you want to play ..to get high score<br /><br />The power ups are cool and the new charters are a nice touch over first game
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Mr. Aslan has done a prodigious amount of outstanding research, which makes this book well worth reading, but he obviously lacks critical thinking skills which is typical of people who have been conditioned at an early age to accept things on blind faith as is the case with Aslan. Thus, Aslan's non-logic tends to go something like this: &#34;I'm a super smart guy who's done a whole bunch of research so when i say 'blah blah blah' you can take that to the bank.&#34;<br />The problem is, Aslan's arguments are easily overturned by his own research. I could give at least a dozen examples but for the sake of brevity I will cite just a few. Early on, Aslan claims that the Gospel is in error when reporting that Jesus returned from his long fast in the desert to make an appearance in the synagogue at Nazareth because the Nazareans were so poor they could not have afforded a synagogue. But on the next page he reports that right around the time of Jesus' birth, the nearby town of Sepphoris was being rebuilt which provided two decades of more construction work than the Nazoreans had ever seen. So if the men of Nazareth all have long term jobs in the construction trade, then why couldn't they build themselves their own synagogue? Well, according to the Gospel, apparently they did and this is the only thing that makes sense according to Aslan's own research.<br />I don't want to write another book, so I will now skip to the glaring non-logic of his initial premise and ultimate conclusion -- that Jesus and John the Baptist were both a couple of Zealots agitating for a war between the Jews and the Romans, along with all the other Zealots of the day. This premise ignores the entire Gospel of Jesus which is riddled with statements such as &#34;Love thine enemy and pray for those who persecute you&#34; and &#34;Return no man evil for evil&#34; etc, etc, etc. It also ignores the fact (one Aslan mentioned) that the Romans had a well known policy of ruthlessly suppressing a first uprising and then responding to a second uprising by 'laying waste' to the land and the people who dared to rise up against them a second time. Jesus and John the Baptist were both well aware of this policy which is why they spent their entire ministry trying to prevent this very scenario. The only way Aslan can support this premise is to suggest that the entire Gospel is a fiction invented by the Christians long after the fact -- an intellectually juvenile argument that most professional scholars would steer away from.<br />In this regard, at one point, Aslan makes the argument that John the Baptist did not baptize for the remission of sins, rather this was a fiction made up by Christians to explain their centuries-long custom of baptism for the remission of sins. If we were to apply the same circular logic to Aslan's new religion we could say &#34;The Prophet Muhammed never told his followers to bow to the east and pray to Allah at certain intervals of the day, the Muslims just made this all up after the fact to explain their centuries-long custom.<br />The big take-away from this book is: you can take the boy out of the fundamentalist church but you can't take the fundamentalist thinking out of the boy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|this is a good show - I think out of a whole season and a half I've only heard 2 cuss words - some sex is implied but it's nothing raunchy or over the top - nothing graphic.  the plot lines are excellent and I really enjoy the characters.  the beginning of this series really pulls you in and I very much look forward to watching this.  I have been watching a couple of different shows at once but this is the one I always go to.  Very good!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|love the movie was very happy to get the dvd and the clearness the Blu-ray brings you good movie . can't wait to see part 2 nice horror-sci-fic  and action all roll up

B00ENBTI8C|5.0|Great ending to Spartacus. No one really knows what happened to Spartacus because he has a un-named grave he might have recovered from his wounds or he might have not had any wounds and just escaped and lived his life protecting his people. How they portrayed him in battle always fighting always protecting his people is correct but how it ended no one actually really knows.

B002M9WW30|4.0|I've always like the Rocky Film series.  On Blu Ray it looks and sounds better then ever. Especially the sound.  And having the entire series together on Blu Ray at such an amazing price is fantastic.  Any Rocky fan would love adding this set to their collection. I do!

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is an amazing story brought to the screen by an amazing Director and a Fantastic Cast.  The filming of this film is a real feast to the eyes, Especially now that it's on Blu Ray.  The score is more brilliant then I've ever hear it before. Worth seeing again and again.
0060987464|5.0|My friend actually gave me this book, during lunch at school one day (she of course knew I loved Manson's music since the day my mother had me look up a song he did because she loves his music), after 4 years of wanting to read this book, I finally got it!  It's very intriguing, I remember a week or so ago I was reading it in geometry and I didn't hear the bell I was so entranced.<br />  It's really a great book!!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I had it on regular DVD.  This Blu Ray just blows that version away.  You would feel like you where there listening to them Live that's how fantastic the video and audio is on this disc. it's one of their best show's I've ever seen.<br />A must for any Eagles fan.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|A few years ago, when I got Asphalt 4 for DSiWare, I was blown away. The car customization, upgrading, and selection were amazing. The controls were intuitive and easy to master. The most important aspect, drifting, was done amazingly, with the ability to control it perfectly. While I never found five or six, i did get Asphalt 7. That game was an abomination. The less I say about it, the better. When I saw that Asphalt 8 was free for a day (at least), I decided to give it a try. While it does not meet up to the standards of 4, it has some great qualities. The graphics are great. The courses are well designed. The biggest gimmick of 8, the jumps, are not overused. My real probles are this: control is really difficult to obtain. Drifting takes quite a while to master. And the upgrades to your cars are pathetic. In four there were 8-11(ish) catagories that were actually parts. In this, there are four that are top speed, acceleration, handling, and nitro. This takes away from the ability to truly tune your vehicle, as in four, where any part could add in some stats and take away others. However, if I did not have 4 to compare this game to, the controls would be my only problem, giving this a 4.5.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Kept me engaged. Great production design. Cruise is always a really solid man of action and the effects, action and overall plot : really good stuff!
1400052181|5.0|good book like new only ding was on the cover of the book it has a crease on the left area
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|This book is one of those rare books that you start with indifference but then slowly, before you even suspect it is happening, you are being shifted to the other side and before you know it you are completely and hopelessly in love with it.<br /><br />Cath is a girl that is pretty hard to resist. She is innocent and awkward and completely naïve to the outside world. She gets lost in her writing and her writing becomes her world, so much so that it takes over her life and she has a hard time adapting outside of it in the real world. Her sister Wren has always been a big supporter and has kept her life balanced. Twins, they were pretty inseparable but once they go off to college, Wren decides that she wants to be her own person and doing that means letting go of Cath and doing her own thing. You can feel Cath's heart break and struggle as she tries to find her way in a world almost too big for her. In a place she never thought she would be without her sister by her side.<br /><br />Cath grows a lot in this, in a very realistic, slowed paced way. No over night break throughs or a big bang, just a constant state of growing and changing and I actually really enjoyed that about this. I love that it felt more real with a slow pace.<br /><br />Levi and Reagan were wonderful friends to Cath, in fact, they were exactly what she needed in their own way. Reagan was tough and comfortable with herself and really, everything Cath wanted to be and Reagan was there for her to help her step away, get out of the dorm and be the type of person that she wanted to be. To finally live her life outside of her laptop and the fanfiction world that she had created.<br /><br />Levi was, well, honestly he was kind of perfect. Awkward himself but also extremely patient with Cath and most of all the friend that she needed most. A friend to encourage her and be there for her when she needed him most. Their friendship was very realistic and again, happened very gradually and over time.<br /><br />If I didn't love this book for anything but how real it felt, that alone would be enough. But I loved how quirky Cath, Levi and Reagan all were and how this showed that sometimes love and friendship doesn't come in a whirl wind of destruction and chaos but instead in a soft healing summer breeze.>If I didn't love this book for anything but how real it felt, that alone would be enough.

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Film is visually stunning. Story close to the book. I enjoyed this version of story. Leo DiCaprio's performance was  great as well as Carey Mulligans, Toby -McGuire and Joel Edgerton.
B002MFULQO|2.0|I only got 40 minutes into this movie until I'd had enough of the Great Conspiracy Theory which is the heart of the movie.  I don't know why the NOLA DA got so obsessed with the idea that there was a right wing conspiracy to assassinate JFK and pin it all on poor Oswald, but there appears to be really minimal evidence of that.  (Not to mention -- why would the Warren Commission let off the evil rightists?)  Perhaps these concerns were addressed later in the movie, but I got tired of waiting for something meaty to show up.  And since I've read and seen quite a bit about the assassination, I also doubt it.  I thought the whole thing was a waste of time, and a waste of big talents, including Costner, Spacek, Vincent D'Onofrio, Jack Lemmon, and Tommy Lee Jones.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I adore this album. Sande` is fresh and very talented. I look forward to next works. I have to add four more words, so here, hope this satifys Amazon.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I've watched T1 and T2 too many times to count, but had no idea there was a director's cut of T2.  The re-included scenes add some length, but a lot more character substance, to the movie.  The visual quality was outstanding, too.
B00ET7ICEQ|3.0|There are a couple of songs that sound like the old Sheryl but for this most part this release has more of a &#34;country&#34; sound than rock.  Maybe it will grow on me but . . . .
B0018OHFK0|3.0|This movie is ok. The story gets your attention, there is a lot of action, but in my opinion it doesn't connect you with the characters very well.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This album is an ode to late 90's metal/rock.  Some tracks are reminiscent of Metallica and Iron Maiden.  Totally worth a purchase if you feel like &#34;Rock N Roll&#34; isn't really the same as it used to be.  I love all the songs on this album except for doing time and planets.  They are decent but not as good as the other songs in my opinion.
B003Y5USG4|4.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. Not sure if its the story, or the fact of all the bad weather...some movies are just classic and this is definitely one of them!!
B00063EMJ6|3.0|i was actually looking for a particular Neil Young song and assumed it would be on a greatest hits compilation but it was not there. I cannot say he would be one of my favourite singers and a bit out of my generation group
B008N1LL42|4.0|This movie has an interesting storyline, and some very awesome special effects. The movie will definitely keep you interested, but may not be a nail biter
B0055V6EZE|4.0|A very interesting performer, I never knew he could sing, not that he can sing all that well but he has something and his performance grows on you. He is not a bad pianist either. I would have to say he is an acquired taste

B005LAII80|5.0|It's a shame this movie didn't make the \\"big comic book movie\\" box office numbers. It was fantastic and a sequel is much needed! WAY WAY better than the Stallone version.

1416972250|1.0|I have read the reviews of these books and I found most to highly recommend it so, I took a chance and started reading.<br />The first novel was ok.  Served it's purpose in setting up the characters etc. but, it was a bit too reminiscent of Harry Potter.<br />The second book was rather dull and hard to get through and this third one... well, I don't think she needed to prattle on for 500+ pages.<br />My problems with this series is that it takes too much of the Harry Potter/Twilight elements and tries to make them original.  They are not.<br />Clary (Mary Sue) is whiny, bratty and self absorbed who never really learns from her mistakes.<br />Jace is just an arrogant brat and I grew tired of reading about his golden hair.<br />The incestuous element was even more bothersome, not at all romantic and made me ponder the relationship, if she has one, the author has with her own brother.<br />I do no understand why people love these books.  I also don't understand how you can make a movie of them.<br />In the rush to find the next Harry Potter or Twilight, I guess any teen fantasy novel will do.
B000002KHH|5.0|This was my first Black Sabbath album I bought around 1972 or so. Years later I got the cassette. Now I have the CD.It has been my favorite album since then, along with Master of Reality. To me, music just doesn't get any better than this. Btw, I am 62 yrs. old and still rockin' !

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and loved the ending. This is a fun and interesting movie but if you are a magician you will probably hate it. There is no plausibility here and for some movies that is ok, the acting is overdone but lot of fun parts to the movie and keep in mind this is a spoof. It is not trying to be a realistic movie but just entertainment.
0307720748|4.0|losing virginity - good one! only problem is that it is slightly longer than what it should be - anyways, a good read.
B00F35BV64|2.0|If you have not seen the \\"Wrath of Khan\\" then don't, at least not until you see this Star Trek. This Star Trek is a variation on that movie but in my opinion, not anywhere near as good. Granted this version has better special effects and graphics and realism but the story is poor, the acting is dull and at times the movie just drags. There are parts of this movie that were obviously added as filler and dull.<br />If you are a die hard Star Trek fan then you will probably like this movie but the first one with Chris Pine was much better and enjoyable, this one was somewhat boring and predictable.<br />I've seen every episode of the original Star Trek TV series and every Star Trek movie. This is not the worst of the Star Trek movies, the one with Picard and Kirk was the worst. Do I regret seeing this movie, not at all as I streamed it and it was cheap and worth watching at that price, just glad I did not go to the movies to see it.<br />If the only Star Trek movies you have seen was the last one with Pine and if you enjoyed that one, you will enjoy this one. If you have seen all the movies (like I have) then you might still enjoy this one but don't expect it to be of the same intense level as \\"Wrath of Khan\\" was.
