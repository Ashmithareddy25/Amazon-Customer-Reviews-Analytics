B003F3NDP8|2.0|I gave up somewhere in Season Three, although I have caught the occasional recent episode on Fox Life.  As much as the cast has changed over the years, things pretty much stay the same on Wisteria Lane.  Through it all you see the same petty back biting, shifty characters and malevolence characteristic of soap operas.  The show had a relatively promising start with the mystery surrounding the death of Mary Alice.  Of course, there was only so far you could take this, and her voice no longer carries with it much concern as she continues to watch over her little enclave.  In a rather desperate gesture, the writers have resurrected Paul Young, but there never was anything particularly appealing about him.  DH appears to have filled the void left behind by such shows as [[ASIN:B00028G7LG Dallas]] and [[ASIN:B000QUEQ72 Dynasty]], with actors you can still warm up to.  But, after so many seasons Wisteria Lane has become a well trodden path with very few surprises.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Love it, Love it, Love it!! I can see why some who love the hard edge blues of Thickfreakness, and Magic Potion may be taken back. But only a half step or less. This has a very 60's feel to it. Reminiscent of Canned Heat and Govt Mule, I even feel a little Cramps and Iggy Pop in there on \\"Howlin' for you\\". These guys just keep making me love them with every new release. get it, let it flow and it'll grow on you guaranteed.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|I was surprised to see so many negative reviews for this film. It seems to me it really nails Robert B. Parker's characters. Maybe you have to be a fan of Parker's novels to appreciate the film. It's a good western with a personality of its own.

0316067598|4.0|Though he probably wouldn't admit it, Marcus Luttrell is a genuine war hero.  He joined the U.S. Navy in 1999 and was trained as a Navy Seal in 2002.  A year later he was in Baghdad and in 2005 was sent to Afghanistan on a mission to kill an al Qaeda leader near the Pakistan border.    This book is about that mission and the horrible losses suffered by his the other heroes of Seal Team 10.  But before he tells you about the mission, Luttrell spends nearly half the book describing how difficult the training is to become a Navy Seal.  When he completes his description of the immense challenges and unrelenting physical hardship, you'll never again regard a Navy SEAL in the same way.    Luttrell then describes how things went terribly wrong during operation redwing and how he became the only survivor of that bloody battle.  He makes the reader understand and appreciate how each one of the men on that mission (and those who tried to save them) was a hero.    Regardless of how you feel about the presence of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, reading this book will make you proud of all our soldiers - especially the one who wrote this book.
B004VB3V0K|5.0|I was learning Haskell on the online version of this book while the last several chapters were being written. On the Haskell IRC channel, you could tell when a chapter went up because all of a sudden, people stopped asking questions about monads, or whatever the latest chapter was about. This book covers every logical step from installing Haskell to monads and zippers. It repeats itself often, almost psychically reminding you of previous concepts and how they fit together. This book is far and away the best way to learn Haskell.

B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time (1986) is one of Iron Maiden's finest albums, despite a more commercial sound. Released after the exhausting World Slavery Tour that had something like 200 dates, it represents a shift to some synthesizer work by Steve Harris that was on par for the time (1986). While this new featured sound doesn't really get in the way of great heavy metal, it's still prevalent throughout the album. The songs have a tad bit more melody to them, and aren't as hard-edged or in-your-face as the previous 2 efforts. My favorite song is STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. WASTED YEARS is a very popular Maiden track, as is HEAVEN CAN WAIT, and to a lesser extent, ALEXANDER THE GREAT. SEA OF MADNESS is solid as well. I really give this album 4.5 stars, and is probably my fifth favorite Maiden album. Still, that's saying a lot, because they now have 15 studio albums.

B000002KIE|5.0|I must say, it took me until my mid-twenties to fully appreciate this album.  I grew into punk rock around 14 and started off with heavy doses of The Germs, Minor Threat and the Dischord compilations, so when I would read anything I could find on punk rock I would frequently see how \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\" was one of the best punk albums of all time.  I went to my local record store and bought the cassette and didn't wait to get home to listen.  I walked to the nearest store that sold stereos and popped it in to give a listen...and was confused.  Is this punk rock, where's the break neck speed, where's the overly aggressive yelling?  I listened fully when I got home, the tape went back in the case and stayed there for years.    I don't just listen to punk rock, I study it, I try to listen to every band in existence and the bands I like/love I try to get everything there is.  Music literally saves my life.  Unfortunately you sometimes hit a dry spell when music digging, that's when you can go back to bands you may have thought were mediocre, do some soul searching and realize you're an idiot.  Two years ago I downloaded (didn't even have faith enough to just buy it) \\"Never Mind\\" and listened to it all the way through while at work, I listened again and again and I fully realized (very late) that this is an incredible, aggressive, real rock & roll album with attitude to spare.    Oddly enough I find the more known tracks (God Save The Queen, Anarchy In The U.K.) to be the lesser of the tracks.  New York, Problems, Bodies, Pretty Vacant, Seventeen... jesus, this album reads like a 'greatest hits' from a band with 6 albums, not just one!  I'm not gonna pretend that I'm a Sex Pistols history major, maybe you feel they were a gimmick, the first manufactured group (hardly the case) but you have to admit, sincere or not, they were ahead of hundreds (thousands?) of other punk rock bands of the time, and today.    Forget the hero worship of certain members, turn down your friends' opinions and turn up the music.  Give it a while, give it ten years, you'll like it eventually.  I promise.

0756404738|2.0|I was really impressed with \\"The Name of The Wind\\" and eagerly anticipated \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\". I even stood in line outside of a B&N for over 90 minutes just to get both books signed by Mr. Rothfuss. But after reading \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" I was left disappointed. I really feel that the overall direction the story took was a miss. The first 3rd of the book I felt was great but when Kvothe has to leave the University is when the book loses me. The situations with the Maer, the Fae, and the Adem were horrible plot lines to me. Its as if someone else took the reigns of the keyboard while Rothfuss got some shuteye and came up with these subpar lines of thought. My biggest complaint is the introduction of the Adem. They never resonate with me. I never feel a connection with their culture or feel that their inclusion in anyway grabbed me and made me want to read more. In the end I was disappointed by the direction the book took after the first 3rd and found my self reading only to complete a book I was extremely excited to get and not because the writing captured me. I just wanted to get it over with.     After a brilliant debut Rothfuss has me confounded on how such an amazing intro could take such a turn for the worse. I can honestly say I am not looking forward to the next installment.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This has become one of my all time favourite movies.  Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek are fantastic.  I like how this film is quirky and beautiful at the same time, thanks to David Lynch.  David Lynch is one my favourite directors and I love his sense of timing and creativity.  I enjoy watching the painted scenery of The Staight Story.  It's a good film to gel out to and trip out while the tractor rolls by.  It's a surreal experience. I enjoy temporarily checking out and escaping this big bad cruel world and The Staight Story allows me to do just that.

B00009Z576|3.0|I am by no means downsizing andersons role in yes, but at the end of the day the backbone and driving force of yes has always been howe and squire. Trevor horn also sounds alot like anderson so its not like this yes sounds radically different. The album itself is pretty solid while not reaching the heights of there earlier recordings its still a hell of alot better than tormato! Best track on the album is tempus fugit, actually its one of the best yes songs of all time. I like some parts of through the lens but after a while the line \\"I am a camera\\" gets really annoying. Its at times like this they could have really used andersons input. If your a huge yes fan this is a must have.

B000001FTD|5.0|without doubt, Among the Living is the greatest speed metal album of all time.  Every song is pretty much flawless and hammers along with an intensity and energy that few bands can muster nowadays.  I first heard this on an excursion at school when I was about 12 way back when it was a new release...a mate of mine had 'borrowed' the cassette from his older brother and got the bus driver to play it. I think we got three songs into before one of the teachers decided it was too fast or heavy or something and told the driver to turn it off. I'd never heard music like it before in my life and was instantly hooked.  I've been a metal fan ever since and at the old fart age of 38, see no reason to stop soaking up every new metal band I can find.  But this album, and Anthrax in general started the whole thing for me and will always have a special place in my life.    Anyway, it's a freakishly cool album and stands up really well considering the different directions heavy music has gone in over the past 30 years.  If you've never heard it...get it.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|Polished interface and very responsive once docs are loaded.    I prefer ezPDF's partial rendering approach over Adobe's approach of keeping areas blank until they can be fully-rendered.  This makes it much easier to pan across map documents without having to guess if I'm panning in the right direction.    The main user complaints are this app is slower than Adobe's.  I used a 2MB PDF file to test both readers and while ezPDF took much longer to initially load the document, it was more responsive once loaded.  Adobe \\"loaded\\" the doc quicker but zooming and panning the doc would cause the app to sit there hanging and a dialog box would pop up to report that the application appeared to be unresponsive while presenting the option to force close it.  Not ideal.    I'd rather have a longer load time up front and have the app respond in reasonable fashion.
1591843790|5.0|I have read a couple of Guy's previous books, talked with him at conferences, and have exchanged some emails.  Yet when Enchantment arrived at our office, I had no idea what to expect. I assumed it was a business book.  Now that I have read it, I can tell you that it is not a book focused solely on business issues. Enchantment can be applied to almost any aspect of your life. There is a lot going on in our lives these days. We are in the midst of a fundamental changes in everything from business to politics to survival -- on a global scale. Enchantment gives you tools and concepts to be a leader and a person of influence in whatever your passion lies.  Whether it's a business, a non-profit, or an concept, Enchantment can assist you in gaining the support and engagement you need to move your ideas forward. I highly recommend this book.
B003UYV08E|2.0|\\"Iron Man 2\\" could have been a great movie.  This is the frustrating fact of the mostly-failed effort of \\"Iron Man 2.\\"  It is not a complete loss, but it is dying of a cancer, a malaise if you will.  It suffers from a malaise that is seeping all over Hollywood over any good franchise.  We all have seen this malaise, felt its effects and lamented its continued presence.  It has brought down titans and peons in the movie industry alike.  The problem is, it is insidious, tempting and truly the devil's fare.  It has gone by many names, but I dub it \\"Sequalitis.\\"  Sequalitis infects any movie that has even the potential to become a franchise.  It has been there since day 1 and will be with us till the day we die since studio executives rate somewhere between dimwits and rutabegas on the intelligence meters. We have been warned since childhood with fables such as the golden goose to stay away, but studio executives must try to kill all that is good in the universe.  They are not responsible for innovation, but they sure can kill it.    Okay, so what is sequalitis, you may ask?  Simple.  It is the mistaken notion that the next installment of a successful movie must have everything the first one did and more.  It must be bigger, more thrills, more chills, more stars and more oomph.  The notion of trying to recreate a formula that worked so well, usually because it was so unique.  Once that uniqueness is attempted again, though, it is no longer unique and therefore loses its magic.  And we can place the blame squarely in the stupid studio executives' grubby little hands.  It is greed unboound.  It is the triumph of commerce over art.  It is...some other metaphor for Goliath beating David.  Movies cost SO much to make anymore, between special effects cost, marketing, talent and executive avarice, union rates and a whole host of other costs that go into the production of a high-profile movie.  Combine that with the slavish devotion to the pre-release focus group feedback and the studios all but strip out any kind of magic or originality into a production until we are left with a bland, flaccid and vanilla avatar of what could have once been something interesting and, yes, fun.    This is the problem with \\"Iron Man 2.\\"    \\"Iron Man 2\\" has approximately 6 good movies in it.  If the producers would have picked 2, they would have had a great movie.  I loved Stark's alcholism, losing his company, a rival nipping at his heels, his assistant taking over, his friend starting a new Iron Man, a wronged villain enacting revenge, a government agent spying on him, a new covert government agency working at cross purposes with him and ---gasp!--- the Avengers initiative.  All of these are interesting plotlines.  But because fanboys want to see War Machine or Black Widow or Whiplash or whatever, the producers tried to put in everything while doing justice to nothing.  It becomes a ham-handed attempt to make a tentpole movie delivered with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer to the side of the head.  Add to that a stupid, cartoon villain (the rival contractor), frenetic MTV-style editing that ensures you can't figure out what just happened, never mind what will happen, and a story-telling device that makes you think you dropped into a 10-episode show at the 3rd for 4th show.  The executives forgot what made the original \\"Iron Man\\" so good, which was about a very flawed man who has a life-changing experience and tries to make good on his past sins.  The iron suit is merely incidental.  The STORY is what is important here, not the trappings.  \\"Iron Man\\" is fantastic until the last 20 minutes when it becomes the battle of the iron men.  This sequalitis makes me cringe for what is in store with the upcoming \\"Avengers\\" movie next year.  When they throw all of these last 5 or 6 movies into the soup, I fear we will get a confused mess, not a worthy story-line.  Bottom-line, don't think too much about \\"Iron Man 2.\\"  It is like a Victoria's Secret model.  It looks beautiful, but in the end is vapid and devoid of any depth or intelligence.  You want to look, you will have a good time.  You want anything deeper, stand in line just like everybody else and lament the \\"pretty but dumbness\\" of the movie.  It is all sound and thunder, but no rain.  Nothing substantial.  But really awesome to look at.
0307595862|5.0|I got hooked on scandinavian crime thrillers long before the \\"Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\\" crazy (which I loved as well - the entire trilogy).  Jo Nesbo is another one of my favorite nordic thriller authors.<br /><br />This is one book in a saga with the main character, Norwegian detective Harry Hole (the last name is pronounced Hoo-lay), a depressed, forgetful, alcoholic with a past full of tragedy, heartbreak and miss opportunities.  Yet in the midst of this, he still manages to find elusive serial killers, stop crime rings all the while knowing there is a snake in the midst of the police department where he works.<br /><br />It doesn't really matter if you read these books out of order (I have), they stand alone quite well on their own.  You might feel a bit confused at the beginning when he is referring to people in his life (Sis - his sister who has Down Syndrome, Rakel a love interest that played a big part in the last book), etc.  But they will soon be clear to you as the author weaves the explanation in without being too obvious about it.<br /><br />I find it a little more exciting and mysterious that the setting for these books is in Norway, both Bergen and Oslo and many places in between. It's interesting to see how the author (and Norwegians) view America and Americans, there are quite a few references in the books, some of them are accurate, some are funny.<br /><br />The translation is very well done.  There are a few awkward sentences where the structure is a little \\"off\\", but I personally think that adds more to the charm and intrigue of the book.  The descriptions of the scenery, Hole's office, home, etc. are all very vivid without being too wordy.<br /><br />This book in particular has a chilling storyline - you wake up one morning to find a loved one missing.  You look outside the window and find a snowman has been built in your yard....wearing a personal item belonging to your missing loved one!  Creepy!<br /><br />Don't pass this one by, you'll be glad you took the time to give it a read and will soon be looking for the rest of the books by Jo Nesbo (he has written a very funny pre-teen book as well that my boys loved \\"Dr Proctor\\" - check it out as well!)l soon be looking for the rest of the books by Jo Nesbo (he has written a very funny pre-teen book as well that my boys loved \\"Dr Proctor\\" - check it out as well!)
1439102724|1.0|I have respected and enjoyed every one of Jodi Picoult's books and was excited to get into this one...until I did. I was most disappointed by the too perfect characters representing the pro-gay issue and the distorted caricatures on the Christian side. I am used to much more intelligent portrayals by Ms. Picoult of characters who represent different sides in a controversil subject. This one was too pat, too biased and frankly, not up to her usual standard of excellence. There was no room for disagreeing with the issue of gay marriage without being  caricatured or maligned for believing in the Bible. I have always felt that Ms. Picoult has dealt fairly with the various sides of a controversial subject until this book.I won't stop reading her, but I will probably take her next literary effort out of the library rather than buy it for my own collection. Once burned....

B0037A4ILC|5.0|I could never understand why people thought 127Hours was a great climbing movie, because its not. That movie was about survival. The NorthFace is what climbing to me has always felt like, and even though its in German it still beats any US climbing movie by far, and it makes you just want to laugh at Bill Paxton the next time you watch Vertical Limit. Vertical Limit is a climbing comedy BTW. In The North Face you get to see what drives people to the top, the challenge to discover the unknown while almost leaving all morals on the ground, and the thought of a summit that can drive people mad while ignoring common sense.

031603438X|4.0|Autobiographies of rock stars usually make dire reading but Keith Richards is no ordinary rock star and his autobiography is the genuine thing, warts and all.<br /><br />It makes no attempt at being literary and is obviously the result of taped interviews which makes it read more like an edited transcript than a book at times.<br /><br />The drawbacks of this are that there are too many irrelevant asides, off the cuff remarks and above all, too many four letter words.<br /><br />On the other hand, it makes the book livelier and more in tune (no pun intended) with Richards' personality.<br /><br />Richards is quite observant and a lot brighter than you could imagine from his public bad boy persona. Could anyone believe that he is a book lover and was badly injured when reaching for a volume in his library and his bookshelves tumbled on top of him?<br /><br />He is dismissive of those he regards as pretentious - Alan Ginsberg was a \\"gasbag\\", Truman Capote an \\"old fart\\" and Hugh Hefner a \\"pimp\\".<br /><br />He attacks Mick Jagger for using Rolling Stones material to try and create a solo career and ridicules the socializing with the establishment that led to him being knighted and becoming \\"Sir\\" Mick Jagger.<br /><br />He is still hostile to fellow Stone Brian Jones who died over 40 years ago and shows not an iota of regret over the murder of a fan at the hands of Hells Angels at the Altamont concert in 1969.<br /><br />At the same time, he is generous in his praise of others such as Scotsman Ian Stewart, the \\"sixth\\" member of the group who died in 1985.<br /><br />I liked this book enormously but have two main criticisms.<br /><br />One is that I feel Richards plays down the effects his years of addiction to drugs must have had on his family, friends and even his professional life. Maybe Jagger was officious and ambitious but Richards admits himself that his drug habits meant he was no longer involved in the business side of the group for years at a time.<br /><br />Secondly, and perhaps most important, nowhere does Richards explain what attracted him and Jagger - a working-class and a middle-class boy from the south of England - to the music (rhythm and blues) that originated among freed black slaves in the United States. He does not convey why this music exerted such a spell on him that he has dedicated his life to it.<br /><br />This has always been a mystery to me and one of the reasons why I have never really liked the Rolling Stones whose songs I find inarticulate and unmusical.ted him and Jagger - a working-class and a middle-class boy from the south of England - to the music (rhythm and blues) that originated among freed black slaves in the United States.

Perhaps it is to thank her for her protection but he isn't exactly sure why. It's as if fate draws him to her, as if she was part of his destiny.<br /><br />He sets about walking from his home in Colorado with his dog, Zeus. There was an indication that the photo was taken in the town of Hampton and after an anlysis, Logan decides that it is Hampton, North Carolina.<br /><br />When he arrives in town, his first encounter is with Deputy Keith Clayton, a sneaky man and a bully who had been in the woods taking photos of unsuspecting coeds who were sunbathing. Catching Clayton in this act, embarasses Clayton and causes him to have an animosity toward Logan.<br /><br />Later, Logan finds that the woman in the photo was Elizabeth, \\"Beth,\\" and that she ran a kennel. There was a help wanted sign at the kennel and Logan accepts a job working for her. He doesn't mention the photo but becomes friendly and an indespensible part of her operation and a great friend to Beth's ten-year-old son, Ben and her grandmother.<br /><br />The themes of the novel are fate and destiny. It could be said that the author, was, at least unknowingly influenced by Mark Twain and the naturalism movement in literature that was popular at the turn of the last century. The movement also dealt with middle class America where a person's fate was already ordained. The literature also placed more emphasis on character than action.<br /><br />The pacing of the novel was precise with a gradual build-up to the momentus conclusion. The reader doesn't know if Clayton will have his revenge and disrupt the relationship with Logan and Beth, who was Clayton's former wife.<br /><br />Logan and Beth's romance was tenderly done and some parallel could be made to the great romance of Romeo and Juliet. However, the reader will have to read the book to find if the ending of this well written story is also tragic.novel was precise with a gradual build-up to the momentus conclusion.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|Finally, a pdf viewer for Android that does everything!  All the other pdf viewers I have used so far have been quite cumbersome.

B0025KVLSI|4.0|It's funny how forgotten and neglected BEATLES FOR SALE often is in their catalog. I read a previous fan review here on Amazon in which the person said that they were tired of fans always treating the earlier records as if they are some sort of \\"prelude\\" to REVOLVER OR 'SGT. PEPPER'. I couldn't agree more! The Beatles naturally evolved in all that they did. We have to remember how little time they did this in: Basically, it would be like a group put their first single out in 2002 (\\"Love Me Do\\" in the UK) & then called it quits last year in 2010! That's only an 8 year span and is a lot of ground to cover in so little time.     With that said, BEATLES FOR SALE is a very transitional album. The question must be asked: Had they done anything like this PRIOR to the album? No. The opening trilogy alone will confirm this (with the exception of the deceptively dark \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT).     And this thing about the covers is ridiculous because their first 2 albums contained the same amount of covers! Yes, The Beatles probably WERE exhausted by the end of 1964. (Supposedly they look \\"weary\\" on the cover!) However, they kept this same insane pace up the following year and produced...RUBBER SOUL! If anything, when I read reviews from critics and fans alike on BFS (and Lord knows I read a lot of Beatles-related anything!), it always seemed to me that these \\"average\\", \\"band was tired and stagnant\\" type reviews for BFS are best-suited for the HELP! album- an album in which, again, they end on another (!)Larry Williams cover.    I say, leave BEATLES FOR SALE alone, listen without prejudice and give it a fresh listen, especially since it's been remastered. Have a cup of coffee, in solitude, under headphones, for crying out loud! Anything! But it's REALLY a good piece of work that, unfortunately, gets forgotten about due to what lies ahead...and that's not fair.

0385523386|4.0|This book isn't perfect (like some others, I felt like the author was a little self-congratulatory in showing us that she was \\"better\\" than the average prisoner, and that she minimized her offense), but it certainly is thought-provoking for a suburban good girl like myself.  The book caused me to confront the day-to-day reality of the prison system, rather than the abstract ideas of crime and punishment.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009) is a must see sci fi TV drama with lots of action, great CGI special effect adding bonding character growth as the series unfolds. BSG's writers deserve much credit for spacing out a great ride with many surprises from beginning to end, unlike many other TV series without direction leading viewers into the land of the lost and puzzled. I really hated to see this one go. Recommend you watch the series from start to finish for pure sci fi joy. Edward James Olsmos (Miami Vice 84-89) stars along side Mary McDonnell (Dancers with Wolves). BSG (2004-2009) is as good as the original (1978-1979) series staring veteran actor Lorne Greene (1915-1987). Greene is best known as Ben Cartwright on the long running acclaimed series \\"Bonanza.\\" My review of BSG (2004-2009) is 5 potato 6 potato.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Plot twists, action, angst, and sexy men. This season has it all, and Eric Kripke's writing keeps it sharp as a tack when it comes to being one of the best television shows out there.     If you saw the finale of season three and are sitting on the edge of your seat, praying that season four will be up to par, don't worry. Not even for a second. This'll blow your mind. And add quite a bit more eye-candy to Supernatural's already impressive resume. Just saying.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|If you're a rock guitarist, you're going to get a lot out of this movie. This is a low-key summit of sorts in which three very different guitarists (Jimmy Page, the Edge, and Jack White)kick back to trade licks and talk about why the love playing electric guitar so much. In separate segments, we also learn about many of the obstacles each man has faced in becoming a truly unique and memorable instrumentalist. For Page - the most musicianly of the lot - it seems to have been the fear of being a session player for the rest of his life. White, on the other hand, feared that his passion for the blues would lock him into a predictable 12 bar \\"blues-rock\\" box. The Edge's story is most dramatic, taking us back to the Ireland of the 1970s which was wracked by an awful economy and hideous acts of terrorism. It's an absolute treasure seeing each of their unique approaches and contrasting them; the Edge revels in high-tech pedals and rack effects whereas White prefers cheaper guitars and amps that he has to \\"fight\\" to get a sound out of.    If you're not a rock guitarist, you will probably deduct a star from my interview and wish there were more \\"fight\\" in this movie. There's absolutely no conflict on display here, and all three guitar heroes are true gentlemen even when they politely disagree. The very best rock movies (such as \\"Hail, Hail Rock and Roll\\" and even the comedy \\"This is Spinal Tap\\") are able to attract nonmusicians through very dramatic scenes with conflict. I saw this film with a nonmusician who found the film long-winded and tedious when the guitarists weren't playing, and I can understand why.    Still, to me, the true beauty of the film is how it forces the viewer to re-evaluate guitarists who they may not personally enjoy. There are those who have claimed Page is a dinosaur who couldn't play well on stage, that the Edge is a player of effects rather than of music, and that White is a barely competent eccentric. I believe this movie proves those people wrong,and it reveals the professional craft behind even what sounds like off-the-cuff playing. \\"It Might Get Loud\\" is like an impromptu jam session with wonderful, supportive friends who allow you to be yourself, and it's worth viewing if you are a musician yourself.
1433502410|5.0|Having previously gone through the Bible cover to cover using another popular version \\"life application study guide\\" this edition I find is far superior. I am using the daily Bible reading plan in the back of the volume and find the History of Salvation in the Old Testament section referencing the chapter by chapter New Testament verses, a wonderful resource to preview, before studying the Old Testament passages. This feature alone has brought illumination and understanding to me like never before regarding God's plan for salvation for all peoples.
159420229X|5.0|This book was an excellent read.  I was able to use the principles in the book right away.  Not only do you get to go with him on his quest to become U.S. memory champ, you also get to read about his training on the way and it is specific.  I was walk.ing out of the eye doctor's office and had the book.  They were asking what it was about.  I had them turn to page 93 and listed off the things one by one...pickle garlic, cottage cheese, salmon, peat smoked, 6 bottles of white wine, 3 pairs of socks, 3 hula hoops (spare), Snorkel, dry ice machine, e-mail Sophia, flesh colored cat suit, Paul Newman movie Somebody Up There likes me, Elk Sausage, A director's chair and megaphone, a rope and harness and a barometer.  I just did that right now using the techniques he gave.  You can check page 93 in the book against my list to see how accurate I was.  I absolutely loved the book because I learned something by the time I was done.

B004FUPK6U|3.0|i don't see how people can consider this one of Argento's best.  i have a version of this film already and can't see myself buying some new release or special edition of the film.  if you already own the film i'd recommend not buying another copy... one of his best?... Really?  people that like Argento should try Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Suspiria, Deep Red to name a few.  of course if you don't have this film and want the trilogy of the three sisters you have to get this to complete the trilogy(along with Suspiria and Mother of Tears)
B003V9J6R0|5.0|I have loved Linkin Park for as long as they have been around. I listen to them and bought every album.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|I was incredulous when I saw that so many readers gave this book 1 star.  This is Michael Connelly, the best writer out there.  Then I started reading the one-star reviews and I realized they were all Kindle readers complaining about the price.  If you Kindle readers don't like the pricing, boycott the Kindle versions for awhile instead of distorting a rating system many readers count on.    This book was definitely a five-star book.  In my opinion, the best in the Mickey Haller series, although I still love Harry Bosch and hopes Connelly brings him back soon.

0307454541|1.0|I'm surprised none of my fellow \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" survivors mention the ridiculous amount of product placement for Apple. He simply MUST have gotten a kickback from Apple for the exhaustive, glowing references to imacs, iphones, hard drives, etc. It's a commercial every twenty (boring) pages.<br />And it's fraught with detailed descriptions of the sandwiches they ate, and all the coffee they drank, ie.: Salandar put on a pot of coffee and made herself a liver pate' and cucumber slice sandwich on rye. And what time they went to bed and what time they woke up. And how their headaches felt. I truly think this book was written tongue-in-cheek. It's a $h-t sandwich is what it is. Life's too short, don't read this book. I want my 20 hours back. The success of this book is a major marketing coup.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book.  Some people think it's amazing and unique being written from the perspective of a 5 year old, but I found that (i.e. his poor language skills) to be distracting.  My complaints have already been hashed out in other reviews: poor grammar yet exceptional vocabulary, British word/phrases, lack of climax except in the middle, etc.  I read the whole book, mostly because I was expecting something exceptional to happen, but it never did.  I still feel like it was a waste of time.  I cannot for the life of me figure out why this book is so popular.  Maybe because the premise is unique?  Too bad it was executed poorly.

B004FUPK3I|5.0|Had not seen Inferno in two decades and was pleasantly surprised by this effective BluRay edition put out by Blue Underground. The color schemes of the backgrounds and Argento's staging of the murderous set pieces are extremely effective. I sincerely hope Blue Underground will give the same fine treatment to both Suspiria and 4 Flies on Grey Velvet.  Truthfully, with Dario's films, you either really like them or loathe them. There seems to be no middle ground. LOL  Among the \\"extras\\" on this disc -- an interesting interview with present-day Leigh McCloskey whose recollections and comments on the filming are most interesting. I heartily recommend this release for all Argento fans.  If you're unfamiliar with the director's work, I'd think Deep Red or The Bird with the Crystal Plumage better introductions to his style and creativity. (My personal favorite is 4 Flies on Grey Velvet which most folk don't seem to take to as readily. Perhaps you had to be a \\"child of the '60's\\" to fall for Mimsy Farmer and the outlandishness of the denouement. ROF)  Anyway, Inferno is a visual treat with a most effective musical score. The present transfer is stunning.

0345522478|5.0|I totally loved this book.  The first chapter was a bit slow for me; it was good, but what I mean is that it drew me in a bit slowly.  However by the time I got to chapter 3, I was WOWED.<br />The book got funnier and funnier and the story better as it went along.  I found myself laughing out loud and that doesn't happen often with books!  I loved the story - it's full of mythology and magic and quips, and the main character is totally lovable and hot.<br />The dog, Oberon, is perhaps my favorite fiction character EVER.  He's so precious and funny.  I really hope there's a lot more of him in future books.  He just might deserve his own book one day?<br />Supporting characters are all well developed, and the writing is tight.  There's no loose or sloppy ends or quick dash to 'address' something in the story to set up a scene at the last minute - it's well thought out and put together so the progression is smooth and believable, even though it's urban fantasy.<br />I think this has the potential to be a best seller.  If it doesn't make it, it's only because of publicity.  IMO, the writing and story are that good and it will please the huge majority of fans of this genre.

0061726826|5.0|I'm going to say what everyone else did: this book was fantastic! I even had the other half curious about reading it, based on what I was telling him while reading it. Lena's inner monologue is believable and actually quite lyrical.<br /><br />With the new trend of Zombie fiction I think Lauren Oliver has made a zombie book of her own. The \\"cured\\" (people who've had the procedure to remove the capability to love) bumble about in their existent blind to what life should be like. I think Lena's love interest described it as the whole world was asleep. And Lena was awake.<br /><br />I don't quite have some graphic to list my rating as. Stars, Bats, whatever. But when I stay up till 3am to finish it, I say it's good. No, great. I'll admit that because I'm more of a paranormal gal I was hesitant to pick it up. But 3 pages in and I was hooked. [[ASIN:006172680X Before I Fall]] had gotten a lot of buzz whe if came out before Delirium and I'm just going to have to read it now.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|While it is a bit slower than the free Acrobat Reader, I love that outlines and links work, and work well at that. I deal with a lot of big PDF files being a church musician, so having use of the outlines is really invaluable.

B003Q6D25K|3.0|I really respect PA. It's so great that people now have the potential to make their own movies in the digital age. And the director, probably due to budget constraints, kept the story squarely on the couple and their little problem. The way PA 2 ties into the first film is quite clever, to have it run as a precursor and then concurrently to PA. But it just doesn't have a true feeling of suspense that the first one did. One goes from a feeling of \\"ooh, what's gonna happen???\\" to \\"sheesh, I hope something happens.\\" The scares are so very s...l...o...w in coming and far too scarce. And at times, the activity is getting filmed but I can't figure out how or why. The cameras in the home were physically installed but these scenes are being filmed by someone else of two moving, mobile characters fully within the shots? Who is holding the camera? The demon? Mighty nice of it. And one other thing I have to quibble on is the Hispanic maid. She's convinced there are evil spirits in the home. This is such a stereotype that comedian George Lopez makes jokes how all Hispanics think they have at least one haunted room in their home. I can vouch that this is true because I'm married to a Hispanic and he's always thought that of each apt and home we've owned as have all his family members of their homes. Sorry if I offend anyone. My point -- it's no big deal or shocker if your Latino says there's a coo couie -yeah , laugh, I don't know the spelling or fantasma (ghost) in the home. I don't have the heart to tell him it's actually La Chupacabra.

0374290024|5.0|Ian Morris is a historian who has a general theory about what brings about progress in a civilization:  \\"Change is brought about by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things.\\"  However in these bursts of progress are the seeds of its own destruction.  Generally this has to do with population growth and running out of ways to harvest energy.  When a society reaches this ceiling, it fails with famine, disease, migration, etc., causing Dark Ages.  Further, he tells us the West pulled ahead of the East in civilization because the Atlantic Ocean is smaller than the Pacific Ocean (stimulating trade.)    It sounds like a good theory, and Mr. Morris buttresses it with a huge detailed history book starting with prehistory and running until today.  This is absolutely fascinating.  My favorite part is the earlier part dealing with preliterate societies.  I felt as if the author had trouble weeding out information the more there was available to him, making the book bog down a little sometimes in the second half.    We have now reached a hard ceiling. Unless we can find a new energy source, we will start a new Dark Age.  (By \\"energy\\" the author refers to the food that we eat as well as the energy to power machinery.)  How we react to this will determine our future.  If we erect barriers to the refugees from rising sea levels, continue burning food for energy, and are too slow to get our energy from renewable sources, we are doomed.  Unfortunately, in this scenario, we have the capacity to destroy all life as we go down.  We are capable of not hitting this ceiling (or, rather, bursting through it) using technology to get past it, but past history doesn't give us optimism.    My hope is that the greed and fear explosion we have seen in the past thirty years will trigger our ability to burst through this ceiling.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This Album is incredible. It takes everything that was good about the metal of my youth (early/mid 80's) and synthesizes it all together into a flat out rocker of an album. I love all these old metal legends coming back strong in this latest metal resurgence and showing this lame nu-metal crowd (most of 'em, not all) what it's all about. That would be killer riffs, badass drumming, and a good screamer who can sing a little. It sounds so simple but so many make it so hard trying to be cute(or experimental or extra evil or whatever).    Anyway, if you liked early/mid 80's hard metal then get this one. It'll take you back but you won't feel dated.

0316069353|5.0|Since it's apparently acceptable to write a review without having purchased or read the book, I'll give it 5 stars.
B004EC5IV6|4.0|Foremost, i enjoyed the tv series: so I am biased. The english dub isn't bad--better than the series--but oftentimes i found myself wanting a gut-wrenching scream: or just a whimper... Nothing. The movie follows a different timeline than series, though and that's its best strength and, in some ways, its worst weakness.

B001E45XT4|3.0|I bought these about nine months ago on sale for only $25. They really are a good deal.    They are comfortable in my opinion but I have owned better ones. 4/5    The sound from the headphones are good quality but not amazing. 4/5    The micro phone worked well for me in Skype and during gaming. 4/5    One bit of advice. The cord is a strong cord from the ear piece on down to the splitter for the mic and headphone connectors...  ...but it ends there. The cords on the connections are very thin and weak which makes the strong part of the cord pointless.  I just broke mine due to tripping on cord and I really didn't tug that hard on it. The cord design is a joke. Durability 2/5 (without this flaw i would have said 5/5)    In the end I'm not saying buying this is a bad idea because the price is decent at around $25 for good head phones, but I'm not buying another because I'm not  happy with the cord flaw. Overall 3/5
0307405095|5.0|I have all of Martha Stewart's cookbooks, so I was pretty excited when this one arrived.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers have gone in great detail about the exact recipes etc., so I won't bore you with that.<br /><br />What I love about this cookbook (as with the rest of her cookbooks) are:<br /><br />1) a photo for each recipe! I really dislike cookbooks that have a recipe and no photo, particularly for desserts. after all, i want to know what it is going to look like.<br />2) very clear, concise, and reliable directions.<br />3) it's very clearly organized (both the cookbook and each recipe)<br />4) a short blurb on the top for each recipe giving you tips/pointers<br />5) excellent step-by-step photos/directions in the back of the book for making pate sucree or pate brisee or puff pastry.<br /><br />I trust Martha Stewart and know she will not put her name on a recipe unless it has been tested over and over.She hasn't failed met yet!<br /><br />First pie I made was chocolate cream pie. Yes, it's a novice pie, but I have a 3 yr old so I wanted a crowd pleaser (or rather a kid-pleaser). Easy to follow directions for the crust, filling and whipped topping. It was absolutely delicious and looked professional. Pie was finished by my guests.<br /><br />Second thing I made was the fruit tart. Rather than do the mini tarts, I did two nine-inch tarts (and she has notes in case you want to do a lot of mini ones or larger 9-inch tarts). Made the pate sucre, made the vanilla pastry cream the day before (my husband and kids licked the spoon from that!) and assembled it a few hours before serving. Beautiful, delicious and I was so pleased with the results.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cookbook, and with her clear instructions, beautiful photos and wide assortment of crowd-pleasing recipes, I know this will be one I will be referring to over and over. Happy Baking!

0425220931|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Victor's playing -- in concert, one of his solos made my jaw drop in awe and joy. I mean that literally, about half way through I noticed my mouth was wide open. This book doesn't make my jaw drop, but it's an enjoyable read. Even for non-musicians, it's a thought-provoking book. If I owned a book store, I'd put a copy in the Philosophy section.<br /><br />*POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT -- FOR THE IDEAS EXPRESSED IN THE BOOK, NOT THE STORY ITSELF*<br /><br />And this book explains a lot about where Victor's virtuosity comes from. It reminded me of a Simon & Garfunkel song, \\"For The Asking\\" -- in the first verse, the singer is playing to \\"make you smile.\\" He becomes discontented, and ends up playing \\"all the love that I hold inside.\\" It's a good read just for the story, and gently poses the question: \\"Are you interested in music for the adulation or for the music?.\\" I bought it to read and then give to a teenager who has a lot of talent but not much self-discipline. I'm not sure I'll pass it on to my young friend, because one recurring theme is \\"don't practice.\\" In context, it's excellent advice -- going through the motions (literally) of mind-numbing drills isn't worth the time. Someone who's working hard to express themselves better *will* figure out the technical bits on the way to that goal. I'm just concerned that the \\"incessant effort to improve\\" message will get lost and only the \\"Look, Mom, Victor says I don't have to practice, and he's famous!\\" aspect will win out.<br /><br />Or maybe it will inspire the kid to ask herself whether she's doing it for the adulation or the music. Decisions, decisions....  I'll probably give it to her Mom. ;-D
0316069353|5.0|I pre-ordered this book because to date I have not read a bad Connelly book and I was fascinated by the smooth transition to Mickey Haller from some of the great Bosch books.  The tie in between the two was brilliant.  Loved the whole concept of the 'Lincoln Lawyer'.     The Fifth Witness did not disappoint.  I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and all of the characters.  Especially pleasing were the final twists and turns toward the end of the novel. True to Connelly's previous works, he keeps you guessing until, and even after, the ending.

044654759X|4.0|This was the first Nicholas Sparks' book I read and I had seen only one of his movies so far(Dear John.) With research I learned Sparks is known as a romance writer and in this book he chose to write about the the darkest side of an unhealthy relationship: abuse, power and control.<br /><br />Working in the field where related websites warn and inform the public with checklists of \\"Are you in an abusive relationship?\\" I love that nothing in the book refers to the subject, nothing on the jacket cover or anywhere in the book's summary. I don't know if that was done on purpose or if Sparks' marketing team thought that would chase fans away learning the book focuses on a subject that others \\"can't relate to.\\"<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />As a survivor now working with victims and understanding how \\"up and coming\\" awareness of the subject of Domestic Violence (emotional, physical, mental, psychological, financial, etc.)is, I admit I began reading the book with an \\"OK, Sparks, show us what you've got!\\" mentality. What he got was the characteristics of a woman in fear of her abusive relationship: the hyper vigilance, the oppression,the low self esteem, the need to please her abuser (in this case, her husband) and her eventual need to fly away from a squashed freedom.<br /><br />And so the story begins with an independent quiet young woman who calls herself Katie who shows up in a small town in North Carolina and starts life over. She moves into a quiet cottage on a dead end gravel road, takes a job as a waitress, fixes up her home, shops at a local market and meets the owner: a widower just a few years older than she. He's got two young children who lost their mother and bring out Katie's sympathy and own mothering instincts. The storeowner and Katie (wfose real name is Erin) eventually fall in love and the \\"wrench\\" is thrown in where Erin's husband, a detective, eventually does learn that his wife had used a fake ID to start her life over and just when things start to feel comfortable for Katie, just as she begins to believe she has managed to leave behind her old tragic life he finds her and tries to destroy the happiness and freedom she has created.<br /><br />(***Please note: In my opinion, Sparks portrays an unusually strong victim who does not seek out the services of an agency, and somehow she figures out how to leave on her own. Since it often takes victims much more than once to leave for good, he does show the protagonist flashing back to other times when she did try to leave and how unsuccessful she was.)<br /><br />Still, Sparks' may be giving an example since Katie is forced to start over far away from her original home, the fact that over 50% of homeless women in the US are fleeing  a violent relationship.<br /><br />The author did a great job of painting Katie's (Erin's) husband to be a psychopath, completely justifying his lies and abusive actions before and after his wife left. This makes the villain completely hated! (Of course not all abusers are psychopaths.)<br /><br />In Sparks' story, which has also sold the story rights to filmmakers to follow the fate of all his other books:) he's created a villain whose thought processes and actions instill enough fear in the reader to keep those pages turning as readers root for Katie and the safety of those she now loves.<br /><br />Safe Haven features a supernatural twist at the end. I think it ties the story together nicely since the reader does eventually root for these co-protagonists of the novel to find family in each other since they have each been displaced in different ways. The supernatural twist might also be a subtle nod from the author that the impossible and unbelievable can be achieved if we desire it enough.just as she begins to believe she has managed to leave behind her old tragic life he finds her and tries to destroy the happiness and freedom she has created.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book.  I didn't know that it was the first in a trilogy until the end, which was a little disappointing.  But now I know I have two more great books to look forward to! I loved the Twilight series and am glad to find another, more mature, story.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I know this has been said many times before, but Zack Snyder is one of the most misunderstood, underrated directors out there today.  That having been said, Sucker Punch is his most underrated film to date.  I'm not going to bother going over the plot and storyline because that's not what a review is for.  As usual, the critics are bashing this film to no end because of their usual reasons... \\"no plot and no characterization\\".  Don't even get me started on critics...  I am a former film major, so I think I know a little about what I'm talking about.  Anyways,  I don't know what movie they were watching, but the movie I saw definitely had a story, it was a little confusing at first, but all you have to do is pay attention and you will fully understand it in no time.  If characters can elicit emotions, then there is characterization, and I did get emotional during the movie.  The five main ladies definitely did a good job with their characters, especially Emily Browning.  She has some talent to spare in my opinion.  In conclusion, if you go into this movie with an open mind, I think you will have a great time.  From one movie person to another, PLEASE do not listen to the critics.    The movie's slogan says it best... \\"You will be unprepared.\\"  I was definitely sucker punched!
B0001CNRBG|5.0|We love this movie.  It fits well with our collection of movies.  It will sit on the shelf next to \\"You've Got Mail\\", \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", \\"It's Complicated\\" and many others like them.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet, because while sound quality is extremely important to me, I'm not an audiophile. I can tell the difference between great sounding headphones, mediocre ones, and terrible ones, and these are great! First I'll list my music preferences because when I was reading reviews, I couldn't really find anyone with a similar taste in music to me, so hopefully this will help someone out:  Dream Theater, Rush, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Serenity, Seventh Wonder, Metallica, Threshold, Pink Floyd, etc    So with that in mind, these headphones make my music sound fantastic! I wanted my music to sound full and clear, not distant and muffled, and I got exactly what I wanted with these!    So if you're a prog-metal head, I think you'll be extremely happy with these. Like I said, I'm no audiophile, so I couldn't tell you the difference between mids, lows, or highs, but I LOVE these headphones!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film is brilliantly narrated by Matt Damon, and spells out exactly what happened to bring us to our knees economically.  The information comes at you so fast that you really need to watch it at least twice to fully appreciate it.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|If you are familiar with Satoshi Kon's films, he is mainly known for the psychological thriller he does best. But Tokyo Godfathers is a completely different genre: comedy. He finally chose this genre, and no surprise here that this movie is equally as amazing as his previous films. This shows that he is versatile and he has great range of genres when it comes to his filmmaking. The movie has heart-warming moments as well as hysterical and ridiculous moments. This is what makes me, an anime fan, proud of being one because of amazing anime films such as this and amazing director like Satoshi Kon. This movie is a must-check out for all anime fans, Satoshi Kon fans, and just any film lovers who appreciate great storytelling as well as animation.

0316069353|1.0|After checking the price of the Kindle edition I decided not to buy  a) a Kindle device   b) any Kindle book of course     Saving paper, trees, reducing trash sounds good but count me out if digital download versions are higher than hardbacks.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I got this book based on the high praise.  It was a page turner but I felt like there was way too much violence and depravity.  It makes me wonder,  as a another reviewer suggested, if all Swedish men hate women.   I will not read the second book based on the excerpt.I also found a few of the plot twists to be unbelievable to the point of ridiculous.  Namely that the story of the killers gets swept under the rug by a journalist who had high integrity.  Second that a girl who was raped by her father and brother and fled to escape and make a life overseas then decides to come home to run the family business.  These two things seemed very out of character.
B002DYKP8S|5.0|Easily one of the Top 5 greatest movies I have seen.  The plot is deep, the characters are rich, the scale is enormous, and the fighting is both a combination of ground and wire fights.  The thing that sells this movie the most is the cinematography.  It is gorgeous and on Blu-Ray the colors pop even more.  The sound is a bit of an issue on English dubs are uncompressed, but this is not enough of an issue like others have said to discourage people from buying the DVD over the Blu-Ray.  The picture enhancements are enough to make this movie with the few extra $ over the DVD.    I can say that I did a fair amount of research before purchasing and would say to get the single disc over the dual-disc simply for the fact that you have essentially all of the same features for less cost.  Also check out [[ASIN:B001HUWQEK Jet Li's Fearless [Blu-ray]]] not quite as beautiful in terms of settings and fight styles, but this is without question one of the few films where you can see Jet's skills with his hands, feet, and a broad variety of weapons. Also you get to see Li actually act which is something lacking from HERO and some of his other films where he is used simply as a fighter or blunt instrument.
1439152780|2.0|I loved Morton's earlier novel, The Forgotten Garden, and had high expectations for this one as well. If this book wasn't tailored made for my reading tastes, I don't know what would be:<br />- Ancient castle in the bucholic English countryside<br />- Past and present plotlines weaving and intersecting<br />- Homage to books, readers and the written word<br />- Gothic elements galore (including madness, forbidden love, family secrets, a lost letter, and a creepy children's story)<br /><br />However, by the end of this massive 560 page book, I was left closing the back cover with what I am sure was a comical \\"What-the-****-?\\" look on my face.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but this book needed major red pencil attention by the editors IMO. Morton is a gifted writer, but this book suffered from too much literary cleverness at the expense of what should have been a gripping and taunt gothic mystery. It's not enough that she can write strings of beautiful sentences; there needs to be a satisfying conclusion to such a whopping tome that I've invested loads of not-so-distant hours toward finishing.<br /><br />This time, the Morton magic didn't happen for me.

B004R13U6Y|5.0|I've been using Aldiko Book Reader for reading pdfs on the Motorola Xoom, so this review will focus mainly on comparing ezPDF to Aldiko's pdf reading experience with special emphasis around the Xoom.    ezPDF Reader is an vast improvement over Aldiko for reading PDFs in several of ways:  1) Much more stable on the Xoom  2) Better use of the extra screen real-estate on a Xoom (such as a windowed view of the table of contents rather than a full screen version--less disorienting)  3) \\"Fitting to Text Column\\" (aka fit width) feature: awesome feature for making the most of the Xoom's 16:10 screen ratio.  Aldiko may have a similar feature, but I never used it if it did.    Other additional non-Xoom-specific improvements/features are:  1) Text-To-Speech  2) Smoother pinch to zoom (Aldiko lags when zooming)  3) Thumbnail support (both apps support table of contents)  4) Quicker access to table of contents (very nice for reference material)  5) Annotation and freehand draw support    Aldiko does have features that beats out ezPDF or that ezPDF just doesn't do such as:  1) ePub format support  2) A fully-integrated ebook store  3) Shelf library view support (both apps support a list view)  4) Better/more-intuitive cataloging feature (ezPDF uses a less intuitive folder technique)    To summarize, ezPDF provides for a better pdf reading experience while Aldiko is stronger at library management and provides a more complete ebook solution.  For those that need Aldiko's non-pdf features, I'd recommend complementing Aldiko with ezPDF if you read a lot of pdfs, especially on the Xoom.
B00021HBGS|5.0|My then-18 month old daughter got these for Christmas and still loves them 4 months later. She likes to dunk them, stick them on the edge of the tub, float them...etc. They actually stick well even though it's easy for her to get them off.<br /><br />There were way too many pieces for her to use, so we left half at Grandma's and still have too many, but it makes it easy to rotate them around so she has a few favorites and a few surprises.<br /><br />She chewed on one when I wasn't watching, and it of course looks chewed! Otherwise, though, they dry quickly, don't shed or discolor as far as I can tell, and are easy for her to use.
1897299214|5.0|For the past two nights I have had dreams about North Korea. I don't recall ever having had a recurring dream. I never dreamt about the North during the early part of this year when I read one book after another about the DPRK. I wonder what tonight's dream will be about, considering I have just finished Pyongyang: A Journey in North Korea, a graphic novel by Guy Delisle (translated by Helge Dascher). Pyongyang is the first work of graphic fiction I have read. It is classed as a novel but it reflects Delisle's own two-month stay in the North Korean capital where he worked for a French animation company.<br /><br />Delisle's observations and frustrations in having to deal with North Korean bureaucracy made for a hilarious read. Although Delisle is in the country on a two-month work contract, he is still led by guides everywhere. Guest workers, like tourists, must pay their reverential respect at all North Korean monuments and propaganda museums in addition to working at their job six days a week. Delisle is given the propaganda tour and he depicts himself in some drawings as barely able to contain his laughter. He expresses his frustration at not being able to find a decent cup of coffee in the whole country. I know what I have in store yet I will be prepared in that at least I have the foreknowledge to bring my own, albeit inferior, instant coffee when compared to brewed, from home when I travel there.<br /><br />The drawings were made with a variety of perspectives which I admired and enjoyed. In the midst of his adventures working with westerners and North Koreans at the animation studio, Delisle inserts a running joke in the form of a police line-up in which he asks the reader \\"Can You Spot the Traitors?\\". One must look at all the people and decide from almost an identical set of characteristics who is a traitor to the fatherland. A typical answer would be Figure #1 because \\"he let the portrait of Our Dear Leader gather dust\\". I do not believe that a graphic novel about North Korea would have had the same humorous touch if it had been written and drawn by someone who hadn't been there. A book like this would be a welcome addition to my collection on account of its artwork alone, and although I have already read it I would consider buying a copy.<br /><br />I read the hardcover edition, which was 176 pages printed on a very thick paper. I always had to ensure I wasn't turning two pages at once since it often felt as though I had multiple pages between my fingers.l about North Korea would have had the same humorous touch if it had been written and drawn by someone who hadn't been there.

B000JML7EC|4.0|The only reason I read this was because I downloaded it months ago to my Kindle. I hadn't read it since a kid; no reason to. But it holds up well.

B00005JMYI|1.0|I never particularly wanted to see this, but a friend swore I would like it and loaned it to me. About the 12 minute mark, I was ready to turn it off, but I liked \\"Blades of Glory,\\" after all, so I wanted to give it a fair shot. I lasted about 40 more minutes (for most of which I was always seemed to be a hair's breadth from quitting just before Fred Willard or someone other than Will Ferrell did some mildly amusing).     And then somebody kicked a \\"dog\\" over a bridge in the name of comedy, and I was done. Out of respect for Christina Applegate I stayed just five more minutes so I could watch her character do one flawless newscast while the idiots around her made faces and *took off their pants* just to try to make her mess up on the air.    In the not-quite-hour that I watched, all the male characters were sexist, boorish morons and the only woman to speak of alternated between being kind of awesome and being a lovestruck idiot. Do not waste your time or money. I certainly wish I could get my hour back.
1439152780|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews, I won't rehash the story line.  I loved the book, although, admittedly, it takes a while to get into the story. This does not negate, maybe even authenticates, the author's scholarly writing skill equal to the Classics.  Kate Morton is better than the best in novel writing.  Her skill came through with each turn of the page. The details in the first half of the book does not waste the reader's time.  It is a story, afterall, and the first 300 pages draw you in.  You want to know what is going to happen to Edith, the three sisters, and Edith's melancholy mother.  I've read two of Ms. Morton's three novels and both have been written with Dickens-like skill.  I have ordered the first book, the House at Riverton. If you love to read, don't mind long books, and love mystery, you will love The Distant Hours.

My only hesitation with recommending people spending money on it, is how many other solutions are out there. But if you don't love any of the apps you currently are reading PDFs on..This is honestly a great option. Much better than a lot of the apps i've used for this purpose. And I like to keep my PDF's and my books that may be in PDF format separate, so having both aldiko and this is really a plus for me.
B004Q9TK98|5.0|I have read all of Jodi's books and I think she is a great writer. I have not however, enjoyed them all equally. Some are more memorable than others. Sing Me Home, however, is destined to be one of the ones that stays with me, in much the same way as My Sister's Keeper or 19 Minutes. What I liked about this was the honesty in the different voices. Each character has a vastly different opinion on the values that society holds dear. There is the extreme, and frankly disturbing, fundamental Christians. There is the view of the characters who are pursuing their sexuality, against the wishes of some members of their community/family. However, what is really important about this story is the impact of love and loss on people, the natural desire to have a family and the heartbreak that is incurred when this does not happen. There are other interesting snippets along the way; the importance of music and memories and how helpful music therapy can be. All of these ingredients makes for a great read.     And if I read one more review about Jodi's apparent formulaic style I shall scream. It smacks of jealousy.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I've been using this gamepad for World of Warcraft for quite a few months now and I can say that I absolutely love it. There are already plenty of other reviews that go into detail about it's characteristics and such but I thought I should take the time to mention one major problem the device has. Periodically, the LCD Manager will freeze and begin to take up as much as 50% of my CPU, requiring me to force quit the application in the Activity Monitor and restart it. This problem is documented in forum posts on Logitech's official website and as far as I can tell, the problem has existed since before the latest software update, which was in August, 2010! If Logitech can get their stuff together and make a profiler and LCD Manager that is on-par with it's windows equivalent (which is phenomenal), this will be a 5 star product for Mac users.

0618477942|2.0|I've been a secondary teacher for three years now, after graduating from university in 2008.  Throughout the many Young Adult Fiction courses I took before graduation, my professors stressed that graphic novels were on the forefront of becoming The New Big Thing in YA literature, and to be well-versed in them.  I heeded their advice and began to investigate some of the latest graphic novels, Alison Bechdel's \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\\" being one of them.<br /><br />After reading so many positive reviews on \\"Fun Home\\" I bought it, thinking the whole coming-of-age story and exploration of identity would appeal to some of my fringe students, who, at the time, were questioning their own identities.<br /><br />At first glance, I was drawn in by the distinct cover and jacket, along with the muted color palette and impeccable illustrations.  Unfortunately, after reading it through completely, the book never made it to my classroom shelves.  My reasoning was threefold: first, although not pornographic or explicit, the book did have a few illustrations of rated R themes that I found objectionable for the classroom environment.  (Duh, I guess I should have known that, given Bechdel's subject matter.)  Second, there were high-brow references to literature, etc. that most students wouldn't be able to place.  Third, the story was just not compelling enough to appeal to the majority of high school students.<br /><br />After 80 years of history behind the comic book culture in America, most casual readers continue to assume that graphic novels are just kid's stories.  Bechdel, and others, are proving that this is not so, as \\"Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic\\" is much better suited to a more seasoned audience.
0670022411|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Yes, it is another vampire book but this one is different.   The book isn't focused on the vampire/human romance but on the fantastic mystery that surrounds them.  But yes, there is also great romance.  The interesting variety of characters are plentiful and it is a book I simply couldn't put down.  My only regret is that I have to wait a year for the sequel.

I haven't opened the extras that are included (I'm saving those for the birthday boy), but its a really detailed book and I know that my son is going to love looking through it.  Super fast shipping and the book was in perfect condition.
1593272839|5.0|I saw this book in it's early stages when it was an open document online.  I pre-ordered the book in August of 2010 and just received my copy a couple days ago.  It was totally worth the wait.    The book says it's for beginners, but it walks from some fairly early topics all the way to Zippers, which, prior to this book confused me a good bit.     I recommend this book to anyone interested in Haskell as the different perspective on the approach of learning it can be enough to provide new insights to the language.    My only wish is that the author could have covered Enumerators, Iteratee and the like in the style of this book.
B003EYVXYQ|4.0|It always blows my mind that so-called 'fans' of something spend more time hating it on the internet than anyone else. There's a fella on here that actually accused Romero of not being a good filmmaker because he thought this film,um, 'sucked, and Diary was mediocre. So, you don't like his last two films, so that means he's a bad filmmaker? Taking into consideration all the other films he's made that you liked? Uh-huh. Sure. Why not?<br /><br />Anyway, enough anti-fanboy rants. On to the actual film, Romero's sixth zombie opus, Survival of the Dead. I actually got a copy from Europe and watched it today after much anticipation. I really loved it. No, it's not Dawn of the Dead, or Night or even Day or Land, but it's really funny, gross and fast paced. Romero drops any major satire or social satire for an old fashioned Western story of a feuding clan of families and the drifters stuck in the middle. Sound familiar? Well, it might if you're a fan of Westerns or Kirasawa for that matter. I understand that some Romero fans may feel gipped without a satirical jab or social comment coming from a Romero zombie film, but he's made five zombie films with that in them, so go watch them if you miss it. This is Romero taking a break making comic book action yarn that's there to be taken in and not abosrbed.<br /><br />This is the zombie film that most resembles Dawn of the Dead. It's very humorous and action packed. It just doesn't have the satire. Though, Romero does manage to through in some jabs in a voice over at the end of the film as the closing, and funniest, image in the film fades onto screen. Romero is still a master editor and his knack for pacing is more forefront here then ever. The film, minus credits, only runs for an hour and 21 minutes but one never feels short shrifted. Though, I imagine when this thing finally hits the states on disc there might be a director's cut. The acting is all fine and there are some great and funny dialogue exchanges that are vintage Romero cryptic and biting. The female soldier character I feel was fairly weak though. She just didn't seem like she was as committed as the rest of the cast. That would be my only complaint about this fun, no-frills zombie film.<br /><br />Romero, pushing through his70's, is still a filmmaker worth watching. I love that he does things his own way and never compromises these days. I wish more filmmakers would bunk the Hollywood studio system and do it this way. All their films might not be great, but at least they'll be honest and uncomprised by committee micro-management.<br /><br />PS: CGI gore. GET OVER IT! Romero likes to make films out of Hollywood without interferance. He doesn't have a ton of money and time that Hollywood films have, so he uses CGI to speed the process, and honestly, it's not that bad. The fire gag is sketchy, but the visual idea and the joke is so great that I just didn't care. I don't need things spoon fed to me in ultra 'realistic' ways if the ideas are good regardless. That's all.<br /><br />The blu ray may the best package for any Romero zombie epic.  It's about on par with Anchor Bay's recent release of Dawn of the Dead, but without three versions of the same film.  The making of suppliments are done very well and in depth.  Everything's covered from casting, sets, locations, to make up effects.  The only really disappointing thing about the disc is the commentary.  Romero shares it with producers....and they kill it.  I like it when Romero does commentary with people like his wife, or Savini, but these guys all sound like jackals sucking at the teet of the brand name Romero has become.  They're annoying and obviously don't really care about Romero's work or the horror genre.  They're just hitching a ride on coat-tails.  Romero barelys speaks, and doesn't say anything interesting about the project or what is actually on screen.  His shared commentary with his stars of Diary of the Dead was better than this!<br /><br />Finally, I find itfunny how many fans turned on Romero(though you know they secretly rushed out and bought a copy of this film anyway).  There was a time right before the Dawn of the Dead remake where Romero struggled to get Land of the Dead(then titled Dead Reckoning) produced.  He hadn't made a film since 1997's Bruiser(worth a look but disappointing.  Very intersting film independently produced by Romero).  Then wham a remake of one of his masterpieces sets a zombie craze in the modern cinema zeigeist.  Before you know it Universal Studios was begging Romero for a new zombie film and that's how Land of the Dead got green-lit.  Sure, it was Romero's first big studio movie(not counting his deal with Orion back in the late 80's and early 90's), but that also meant he had to leave some of his creative control behind. Not that that effected the film too much, it's great and the best of modern zombie film in my opinion.  The thing is now Romero works strictly independent.  But the problem is the only films he can get made are zombie films!!!!!  ARGGGGGGHHHH!  You know he loves the subject but I'm sure he wants to tell other stories and I wish someone would let him.  NO MORE ZOMBIES!  They're played out and Romero seems to have run out of things to say with them, which is evidenced by the lack of a message and more focus on Western fun in Survival of the Dead.  I wish I could fund his next non-zombie project....I bet it would be glorious.you know they secretly rushed out and bought a copy of this film anyway).

0553801503|2.0|Let me start by saying I am very new to this series. I bought A Game of Thrones randomly without knowing anything about the series. I loved it. I read it in a couple days and completed the next two books just as quickly. I was addicted, and with the upcoming HBO series, I was very excited to see where this series was going in A Feast For Crows. I was under the impression that A Feast for Crows was the final book. Then I found out about the upcoming book, and I thought, \\"Oh...Okay...Yeahh!! More to read about these awesome characters!\\" A couple hundred pages into the book, I started to notice the overwhelming amounts of secondary unnamed characters that I didn't care about and couldn't be moved to care about. More than this I started to realize how tedious this was. I flew through the previous three books. I've had this one sitting on my desk for weeks. So I flipped through the book to see when the next time I'd get to read about Jon or Tyrion or Dani or Bran!! And you all know what I saw when I flipped through the book: NOTHING. Instead this book is filled with villians and unknowns (and it would have been best it they had stayed unknowns).   I was pleasantly surprised to come on here and see the reviews that agreed with what I was feeling. I thought maybe I was crazy; maybe I was just being negative. Nope. Everyone noticed Martin's downfall on this one, and everyone also noticed how his \\"To Be Continued\\" is a big F-You to his readers.   I'm invested in this series at this point. I want to know what happens to my favorite characters, but if the next book turns out the way A Feast For Crows did then I will be another person who quits reading this series.   Here's hoping HBO cuts out all this inane bs when they get to this part...
159420229X|5.0|I have read a few other books that were strictly memory enhancement books without an interesting story to follow, and I found that I actually learned a lot more from Moonwalking with Einstein than I did from the other books. Joshua Foer explains the memory systems in ways that are easy to understand, and he gives examples of how he was able to improve his techniques to get them to work better. Also, even if you decide not to use any of the memory techniques he used, the main story is interesting. During his own journey, he traveled and met with many interesting people. His story, the stories of the other people he met along the way, and the actual techniques he explains are each very interesting. Overall, it is one the best books I have read in a long time.

0062060554|4.0|BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is a novel about a woman who has a unique kind of amnesia--she can't make new memories.  She is able to retain memories while she is awake, however once she goes to sleep, she forgets everything again, waking up in the morning, sometimes believing she is a teenager again, sometimes believing it's twenty years before.<br /><br />She keeps a journal--the first part of the book talks about her meeting her husband (for what again seems like the first time) and her neuropsychiatrist calling her, telling her that she needs to read the journal she has been keeping for a while. He gives it to her, telling her to contact him if she wants to continue her treatment.  The idea is that she is progressively remembering her life before the \\"accident\\" that caused her amnesia.  For some reason, Dr. Nash has the journal on this day and has read it already--and he's giving her the choice of remembering or not, basically.<br /><br />The first part is short--a chapter.  The second part is the meat of the book--The Journal of Christine Lucas.  And, yes, it reads like a journal.  But each day, Christine starts not knowing where she is or who she is in bed with to learn that she's married to a teacher named Ben.  She receives a call from Dr. Nash--and it's after she's read the parts that came before \\"today\\" that she writes to herself what happened that day.<br /><br />I have always loved the idea of exploring memories and their connection to sleep.  There IS a connection--or so I've heard--some saying that it's in sleeping that we correlate the mind's contents which is why dreams are typically so fragmented.  We're taking everything that happened that day, everything that we saw or thought or heard or smelled or imagined and putting all those thoughts and memories into their proper places in our mind.  That's part of why, during times of sleep deprivation, we tend to slow down and become more forgetful.  Not only have we not taken the memories we created from short-term memory to long-term memory, but we're slowing down the accessing process.  It takes longer for us to get to those memories than before.<br /><br />I really think this book was absolutely brilliant.  While there are a few stylistic things that I haven't been too keen on, nothing really distracted me from the story itself.  S. J. Watson has done a remarkable job of taking us through Christine's mind as she learns about events and people in her past and the frustrations involved in not being able to remember.  While reading the book, I felt as though I was there, trying to figure things out right along with Christine, and I enjoyed that immensely.<br /><br />Definitely a satisfying book :)m memory to long-term memory, but we're slowing down the accessing process.

0307887960|3.0|The Dukan Diet: 2 Steps to Lose the Weight, 2 Steps to Keep It Off Forever boasts millions of successful followers who swear by the high protein plan and I give the followers a hearty applause for their successes.  I, on the other hand, cannot imagine following Dr. Dukan's doctrine of the lifelong limitation of many foods which I know comprise a balanced diet in humans and a designated day weekly for only pure protein consumption.  As with carbs, sugar, fats and alcohol, it seems logical that any excessive consumption will eventually produce negative effects on a body.  I believe this is also true of a protein based diet.  He claims that \\"Man is a Carnivorous Hunter,\\" but I suggest that the \\"hunting\\" of humankind in the 21st century is in the aisles of a supermarket, not in the streams or fields.  We don't use arrows or fish hooks, but rather shopping carts and credit cards.  We have an enormous array of foods from which to choose and need to exercise discretion in our choices.  This is where many of us go wrong.<br /><br />Dukan's plan consists of 4 steps, the first of which is the most dramatic.  One eats only pure proteins for typically 3-7 days, determined by completing an online survey for the suggested duration.  This is followed by step 2 with the addition of limited vegetables usually every other day, but the protein is still the foundation of this diet.  The dieter has the option of Dukan's 5/5 approach which would be 5 protein days alternated with the 5 added vegetable days, but his theory is that people are more inclined to follow the 1/1 menu.  Once the \\"True Weight\\" is achieved, the individual follows step 3 for a total of 5 days for every pound lost, where whole wheat bread and low fat cheeses are introduced.  Also included are two meals of one's choice, to be consumed on separate days during the week.  In step 4 which is to be followed for life, \\"all\\" foods are allowed but one must still enjoy 1 day a week (he says it's Thursdays) consuming only the pure protein which was enjoyed during step 1.  In all steps, included is a specific amount of oat bran from 1/5 Tbsp to 3 Tbsp, at least a quart and a half of water and brisk walking.<br /><br />I'm all in favor of oat bran, water and brisk walking.  I even enjoy the galette Dukan offers and enjoy that on most days.  I'm also in favor of being aware of what foods and beverages one consumes and encourage a diet and exercise log.  On the other hand,  I'm not in favor of a plan which is so heavily based on animal proteins.  As a person who eats no meat but an occasional meal of seafood, I found this diet to be unbearable as developed.  Dukan offers us eggs, lowfat milk, yogurt, seitan and tofu as our protein options.  If one eats no seafood, it's extremely difficult and I do not believe very healthy, even for a short period of time.  Several years ago, I followed the South Beach Diet for a couple months and took off some pounds with his high protein diet.  I was able to follow the diet because of broader vegetarian options and an easy to follow plan.  It has left a positive impression on me and I've thought of the information I learned from the book.  (Thanks for the garlic smashed cauliflower!)<br /><br />I consume a diet which includes many vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and the consumption of only fish, egg whites and tofu made me ill.  Yes, I took off a couple of pounds immediately, and am still taking off weight, but I'm now paying closer attention to what I'm eating, when I'm eating, why I'm eating, and I'm keeping a journal at myfitnesspal.com  The Dukan book catapulted me into taking off some weight and that's a good thing for most of us who are considering this book.  For me, a more suitable plan would be Weight Watchers which seems more healthy, palatable and if followed, offers long lasting success, so I'd suggest checking them out, too.  One does not have to starve in order to lose weight.<br /><br />Dukan's writing is easy to read and understand.  He is motivating and convincing.  The book layout is practical, with a section of recipes included -- some are tasty, too.  I would stress that interested dieters pay attention to what Dukan writes at the start of the book:<br />\\"The material in this book is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for the advice and care of your physician. .......

B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I got the Raynox DCR-250 for my Canon PowerShot SX10 camera and I absolutely love it. It is the camera accessory that I use most often. It comes with a snap-on adapter that just simply snaps onto the lens of the SX10, no other adapter needed. If you already have a filter adapter for the SX10, it snaps on just the same. Very easy to add on and take off, plus small enough to just slip into a pocket while not in use.<br /><br />I needed something capable of taking images of things smaller than half a millimeter and this lens added onto my camera allows me to do just that without having to buy expensive macro equipment. In terms of magnification, it gets me roughly 0.66:1 on the sensor at full zoom. Since the sensor in the camera is so tiny, this would correspond to a 3.7:1 magnification on a 35mm equivalent. I have taken pictures with it that show the facets in a fly's eye, the colored scales on a butterfly wing, pollen grains on a stamen, spores being released from a moss capsule, and individual cells in microscope slides of plant cross sections placed on a light table.<br /><br />There is a learning curve in how to use it due to two factors: 1) very shallow depth of field, and 2) vignetting at low zoom levels. You have to find the right combination of zoom and distance from the subject to get the best results. You might also need some additional light or set the camera on a tripod to avoid camera shake. I usually take a lot of pictures, varying the distance between camera and subject slightly, and select the best. Not every picture turns out in focus, but the ones that do make truly stunning photographs.<br /><br />Update: Also works well with the Canon PowerShot SX40 HS camera and almost gets up to true 1:1 image representation on the tiny sensor with that camera when making full use of the zoom. I took some pictures of microscope slides against a light box and added an example image to the product page. Based on a few quick tests, it would be possible to make prints at a decent 150 dpi resolution that would show up to 1:125 magnification over the original.

I'm not going to try and act as if I am qualified to rate the academic merits of the music, but if you like this genre of music and especially if you already like the Foo Fighters, you will love this album.  If you don't like them, you won't like the album.  Pretty easy, huh.  I am not a rabid fan of Foo Fighters, but there music is uniformly very good and this is definitely not a slouch..    Also, I have to say that Bridge Burning and White Limo are pretty kick ass tracks!

And then, Robert Plant did 3 THREE songs, including the mind blowing Innuendo and a stunning Thank You, and they get cut out. Extreme, Guns, Def .... But Zucherro??? Oh, he's in there!!! Really bad choice here, why on earth did they decide to chop this up? $20 bucks down the drain.

B003Y5H4SO|5.0|A great hook - an elevator breaks down with five strangers stranded inside, one of whom may be the devil incarnate - and a movie that proceeds to live up to the potential of that hook makes \\"Devil\\" a can't-miss for fans of horror and supernatural mystery.  Starting off with a police investigation of an unsolved suicide before swinging into the elevator plot, the movie actually weaves several different angles and subplots into its main devil/elevator hook, making for an extremely potent whole.       The efforts of the building's maintenance crew and security team to get a stuck elevator moving again become a lot more pressing after the first of several temporary blackouts on the elevator (the inside of the elevator can be observed through a security camera).  During these early blackouts, things start happening on the elevator, that neither the passengers nor the security team nor the viewer can initially see.  It quickly becomes apparant that there's a potential for violence in this confined space and the police are called in, though few observers in the building's security room really suspect how dire the situation is.  The film splits its time between the elevator and the happenings on the outside about evenly, and unfolds at a fast, energetic pace.       There appear to be secrets to each of the passengers in the elevator that may or may not tie in to the main events.  There's a potential shortcoming, admittedly, that I guess should be addressed, and why I don't feel it really hurt the overall movie.  But it only becomes evident quite a ways in, so I'll put my usual disclaimer over it:    ****WARNING: POSSIBLE SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD****      If, as it seems, the devil has come to Earth to harvest humans, this arguement could be used: Yes, the characters all have some flaw or dark part of their past, but are all of them really That bad, as in Devil-come-up-from-Hell-and-grab-'em bad?  Why I don't feel that this hurts the movie too much: for starters, the devil isn't likely to be a forgiving fellow.  Besides which, although stories like this often have the devil/demons bound by some kind of rules when they make it to Earth, why does that neccesarily have to be the case every time?  Also, the movie wouldn't work if you had the elevator populated solely by characters you'd want to see dragged down to Hell.  It had to have each character have something potentially sympathetic/likable (at least at the start), and to have each character have something potentially unlikable.  It did a good job in this.  As to the ultimate fate of each character's soul if and when the devil does 'em in, a lot of that's left to the individual viewer's imagination and interpretation.    ****END SEMI-SPOILERS SECTION****      The movie puts a lot into its relatively short running time (81 minutes), resulting in a quick, constantly engaging dynamic.  The performances, musical score, and overall production all get high points, and \\"Devil\\" grabs you right at the opening credits and doesn't let go.  Among 2010's best movies.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Very good flick!  Actor looked like Mark Z!   Showed it to a gathering and All enjoyed it.  Interesting take on what 'supposedly' took place with the development of FaceBook.  Highly recommend- for entertainment viewing.
B0042816YK|2.0|I have so many issues with this film I'm almost hesitant to even write this review, since I don't really know how to start it.  I mean, what is there to say that wouldn't sound like a random checklist of insults to the film?<br /><br />Maybe I should start with a synopsis.<br /><br />Based on the memoirs of Elizabeth Gilbert, a young woman who abandoned her marriage and her `life as she knew it' for a lesson in self-discovery by scouring the globe in search of meaning in her life.  She went to Rome, India and Bali.  She ate, with little regard for her waistline.  She meditated with mixed results and she fell in love for the second (and longest) time.<br /><br />Sadly, that is kind of all there is here.  The film doesn't dig into the meat of Liz well enough to create something more than superficial.  Even the basis for her divorce seems selfish and underdeveloped.  I understand that she and her husband were `different people' but that is the case in every relationship and Liz came across as a selfish and stubborn woman who was tired of not getting everything she wanted, despite not fully knowing what it was that she wanted.  The places she goes are beautiful and the food she eats looks scrumptious, but there is no weight added to her actions.  She seems one-note, desperate for something but not fully aware of what that something is.  And her revelations come about in a way that breathes a lot of contradiction into the film; for the message seems unevenly toned.  Her adventures lack depth and development and give the air of pointless pandering, failing to emotionally connect to the audience.  And then there are sequences and plot lines that defy all logic.  Normally one would have to suspend disbelief with cinematic musing, but a film that is adapted from a memoir needs to have a feeling of realism that `Eat Pray Love' lacks.<br /><br />It makes no sense to me that Liz would be so well received instantaneously by complete strangers, but that is just me.<br /><br />Julia Roberts is a good actress.  She's not great, but she's good, and she's better when she allows the natural charm of her comedic skills to take over (don't take yourself too seriously) so when she gets angry and tries to act upset she comes across awkward and unsure of herself, but when she giggles and smiles and charms the audience it works gloriously.

B003PIUC02|5.0|I thought this was an excellent series. It was of great quality and arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is a quote from Gunnery Sgt. John Basilone in Camp Pendleton, as he's training his recruits, in response to one of them saying \\"I'm sick of this training.  I want to Slap a Jap!\\"  He's trying to prepare his naive boys for doing combat against the vicious, brutal, fanatical Japanese soldier of WW2.  He killed many Japanese soldiers on Guadacanal, which was a true fight to the death, but he certainly did NOT take their skill and fanaticism lightly.<br /><br />The rest of his angry speech goes, \\"He (the Japanese soldier) is a combat veteran, and an expert with his weapon. He can live off of maggoty rice and muddy water and endure misery YOU COULDN'T DREAM UP (in soldier's face) in your WORST NIGHTMARE! The Japanese soldier doesn't care if he gets hurt or killed, as long as he kills you. Now you can call them whatever you want but never, ever, fail to respect their desire to put you and your buddies into an early GRAVE!! IS THAT CLEAR?!\\"<br /><br />So to me, this speech epitomizes The Pacific..... Gritty! TRUTHFUL! NON-PC!!! Brutally honest!  The Pacific follows 3 Marines from training, through Guadacanal, through Cape Gloucaster, Peliliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  They were Eugene Sledge, Robert Leckie and John Basilone.  They all weren't together at the same time and they didn't fight in the same battles, but their lives cris-crossed over 4 years.  Sledge made it through 2 huge battles (Pelilu & Okinawa) without injury, but returned hardened, angry and horrified at the nastiness of war.  Basilone did amazing things on Guadacanal and Iwo Jima before he died.  And Leckie made it through Guadacanal and Cape Gloucester (being temporarily sidelined for mental fatigue), before being severely wounded on Peliliu.<br /><br />If you're a fan of reality, if you think that war is too glorified in movies and want a more truthful presentation, if you want to get insight on why the Marines hated the Japanese and took virtually no prisoners, if you want to get some insight into thebitter feeling of the Pacific Campaign and the misery of jungle warfare, then watch this series.  I highly recommend it!  What the Marines did in Guadacanal was amazing and surely turned the tide of the Pacific War, along with Midway.  The series makes this point very clear that they were out-manned, had the Japanese air and ship forces lined up against them, and they still won.  It was truly remarkable that they could inflict huge losses on the Japanese, with their WWI legacy weapons (still using bolt-action rifles!  But also BARs,  and 30-cal machine guns).  What they did on the other islands was no less amazing, for their sacrifice and guts to accomplish a very, very dirty, sacrificial and brutal job.<br /><br />I loved the interviews with the real soldiers as old men, reminiscing.  They were American teenagers, trained by the Marines, sent off to fight the veteran, brutal Japanese soldier, and they couldn't have done a better job.  But they became brutal & savage in doing so, in order to survive.  In the movie on several occasions they wonder out loud, why the Japanese, being hopeless outnumbered & wounded, wouldn't surrender.  By the end of the war they didn't wonder any more, they just understood it and knew that the Japanese would have to be all killed in order to win the confict.  It's an extremely sobering thought, and bears greatly upon the US decision to go to extreme tactics of firebombing cities and using the 2 atomic bombs.<br /><br />Then the Marines somehow regained their humanity and returned to the US, and picked up their lives again as civilians.  \\"The Pacific\\" details this very well, and gives you an amazingly realistic feeling that you are there in 42-45, in the jungle, watching real Marines in war, and yet all the time realizing their humanity.  It also shows their relationships with the women of their lives.  It's heart-breaking that Basilone stopped fooling around, married, was very happy, but tragically re-enlisted.  His luck then ran out as he died and left his bride behind after less than 1 year of married life.  But his presence on Iwo Jima surely helped to win that bloody battle and save others' lives.  He gave the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />It's thought-provoking to think that after the Japanese had the military brutality burned out of them by the war, suffering what must have been an unimaginably bitter defeat, with millions of them killed, that they are now among the most polite, peaceful and civilized people in the world.  This is another sobering paradox to contemplate.  I recommend that you watch the Pacific as you try to understand how normal people deal with the brutality of war.

However, none of the stations listed for my locale actually work. And some of the  most popular ones aren't even listed.  Very disappointing.  I had high hopes for this app, but it falls well short of my expectations.

1416550550|5.0|I love having a book that I can't wait to get back to.  This was one of them - such a wonderful read.
1573229725|4.0|\\"Fingersmith\\" packs quite a few twists and surprises.<br /><br />At first, after reading the book's plot summary, I expected it to be a rompish, \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\"-like adventure. 17-year old Susan Trinder, a foster kid in a family of fingersmiths (thieves), is recruited to act as a lady's maid to equally young and wealthy Maud Lilly. Susan's role in the devious scheme is to gently push this naive and simple-minded girl into the arms of Mr. Rivers, strip Ms. Lilly of her inheritance and then dump her in a madhouse.<br /><br />Needless to say, the story didn't quite turn out to be about a man seducing an innocent girl out of her knickers and money. Like every other reviewer, I will refrain from revealing anything more of the plot. Let's just say, \\"Fingersmith\\" becomes a much, much darker tale full of violence, abuse, betrayal, dark secrets and a little bit of girl love (not explicit like in \\"Tipping the Velvet\\"). Nothing in this novel is what it appears to be on the surface.<br /><br />Very few modern authors manage to write historical fiction that sounds authentic. Sarah Waters is one of the few that can do it exceptionally. I haven't read much Dickens to enter a flowery comparison here, but Waters' prose is very much on par with the best 19th century writers, only slightly more explicit and touching on the subject hushed out in the mainstream fiction of that era (I am talking porn and reprehensible way of treating wealthy women behind closed doors and in houses for crazies).<br /><br />Knocked down a star for the not long enough ending and necessary to the plot, but nevertheless often redundant middle part.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Ever since I heard \\"Chasing Pavements\\" a few years ago, I have really loved Adele. I was really excited to get this new album, but I have to admit that I didn't like it at first. All the songs sounded the same and there were too many ballads. I guess I wanted a dozen copies of \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\" But after listening to the album several times, listening to the lyrics and really letting the songs seep into me, I love it. She shows such a maturity with these songs; it's hard to believe she's only 21. Has she really experienced the heartache that she sings about? Other than \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" my favorite songs are \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" and \\"Someone Like You.\\" She sings with such power and the lyrics are really heartbreaking. Other standouts are Don't You Remember, I'll Be Waiting and One and Only. Although I love the album, I still wish there were more songs with the tough, dirty, sassy sound of Rolling in the Deep and Rumour Has It. Most of the songs show her as a really vulnerable, abandoned lover who's been done wrong. But she sings this kind of song so well, it's hard to fault her too much.     I also want to say that people pidgeon hole Adele by saying she's just another blue-eyed soul diva singing 60s style songs. This is true to an extent, especially on \\"I'll Be Waiting\\" (which reminds me a little of Aretha Franklin. This and Rolling in the Deep are the only 2 tracks that sound \\"60s\\" to me). But really, Adele is so much more than this. Let's not pin her down so rigidly.
1591843790|4.0|I'm very good at not disappointing myself when I pick magazines, books, or movies. Surely, I didn't disappoint myself with this one. Just like in my case, the knowledge is there, the zeal is there, but something seems not to be clicking. So after doing my homeworks, I picked this book. What an awesome book.   It takes you through things you might probably know of but have not been applying correctly or taking full advantage of. It's an eye opener. Infact, I am getting a website, redoing my facebook, and twitter and gearing up towards taking on my world. This book gets you ready to push yourself and your ideas to success. Sometimes, things aren't working because of how we see and do things. He teaches you how to spruce up yourself, spice up a little, and do things the correct way. And for those of you who like to do things right, you'll be endorsed to live a lifestyle of love.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am completely addicted to this series, but my advice to anyone who starts reading this book:  wait until the character \\"Chronicler\\" appears before you write the book off.  I almost stopped reading this book because I thought that the beginning was boring and I wasn't impressed with the writing style.  However, once Chronicler appears the author hits his stride and the book gets much, much better.  The author is very good at keeping you guessing, and you'll quickly realize that a lot of your guesses about the plot are typically wrong.  I'm halfway through the second book and it is just as good.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Best fantasy book in a long time, ALTHOUGH a slow first 100 pages this book picks up pace and depth.  Be prepared to lose some sleep being unable to put this one down.
B000P6XU5G|5.0|One of the Duke's best. There is nothing better than watching this classic on Blu-ray. Amazing how much detail you notice.

B004LUHQ1G|3.0|\\"Ooohh they're rocking hard again, returning to their roots. What a great idea! Cut and paste riffs from the popular 'Colour and the Shape', and throw in a 'Weenie Beenie' rip-off, yeah, that'll get the fans back on side. And what modern Foo Fighters album would be complete without an endless list of stars making negligible contributions?\\"      The Foo Fighters latest album 'Wasting light', is just that, another Foo Fighters album, much the same way the previous ones have been. What did you expect? David Grohl break-dancing, reciting Celtic poetry and playing the accordion at the same time? No, of-course not! Melodic rock with opaque lyrics and the occasional acoustic guitar. On this album the formula has become tired and old. Actually, this album FEELS tired and old.     But this is the Foo Fighters we're talking about, and a weak album by them is still good, and hey! 'Dear Rosemary' is a really nice song, a melodious heart-on-sleeve song, and they are rarely 'heart-on-sleeve'. Otherwise they wouldn't have called themselves the 'Foo Fighters', duh! They'd have called themselves something smaltzy like the 'Teary Violins' or 'Romantic (Alternative) Rockers'. Rating **1/2 (2.50) or slightly above average.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I think the album title is an actual reference to this being a series of \\"b-sides\\".  The King of Limbs.  Limbs from trees.  Extras.  Leftovers.  But the best leftovers they have to offer.  This is what Radiohead does.  They did this with their album titled \\"OK Computer\\", but they didn't blatantly tell everyone that this was a reference to them starting to use the computer in their music.  And with \\"Kid A\\" too actually, as it was part 1 of a 2-cd series [Amnesiac being the second]    It's an all around good listen, but it is quite obvious that it's not an in-studio effort from the whole band all together.  Barely any guitar.  Mostly electronic loops.  Could easily be packaged as just a Thom Yorke cd.    It seems as if they might not be touring for this album.  As an earlier review noted, expect more to come in the near future.  And when this one comes out, we will be absolutely blown out of the water.
1400082773|5.0|I read this book last summer and it raised a mixture of emotions:- at times he disappointed and even angered me...at other times I was inspired proud and elevated. One thing that was constant is the fact that Barack Obama is a beautiful writter. His honesty also shines through. I think thats what made me angry at times, as he did not always do or think the way that he should- or rather the way I expected the 'future' first black president of the USA to act or think. He was, in this book, very much an ordinary man navigating his way through life, making mistakes as we all do and making the best of things. It was comforting to see that even this great man still grappled with self doubt, identity issues and just the trouble of figuring out just what to do in life. I loved it because just like life sometimes it made me laugh,  made me angry, made me think and made me cry. A great book, a great man and a great read!
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is a very good DVD and Jillian pushes you, however I can't get to the workout without going though the commercials and the intro.  after watching it over and over we start the DVD and do something else for the 10 minutes of intro and come back when the menu comes up on the TV to begin the workout.
B004SQS9FA|1.0|I have been a fan of Radiohead for about 10 years. I have all the cd's and am a huge fan of the Bends, OK Computer, Hail to The Thief and In Rainbows. The other albums in my opinion, while not great still had several tunes that I liked.  This album however has no real redeaming qualities.  The sampling and digital effects are so overwhelming that it is unlistenable.  If the songs had a decent amount of anything to grab hold of other than electronic looping I could probably tolerate it. The only good thing about the album is that at 37 minutes it has taken me less than 2 hours to give it the required 3 spins in its entirety before it goes to the trash forever, never to be heard by my ears again. I think Radiohead might have tried to see how bad a cd they could make that would still garner an average rating of 4 out of 5. The average is 3.5 on this site and if more fans would stand up and give this cd the poor review that it deserves the average would come down below three.  I am OFFENDED by Radiohead for putting this out there for their fans to waste their hard earned money.  They must know this is crap.  Anyone who gives this cd a higher rating than 2 is brain dead.  This album will be hard pressed to remain on my 120 gig ipod.  Maybe This cd is some kind of a joke that Radiohead will let everyone in on eventually. That would be the only good excuse for this trash.

B002VECM6S|5.0|I rarely purchase movies, but this is one of those movies that you don't get tired of watching over and over. It's a great sports story but a better story about family values. It's dramatic, funny and inspirational, all in one. And Sandra Bullock was the real deal in this one...totally deserving of the Best Actress Oscar. Her role was genuine and heartfelt.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of those books that after you finish reading it, you just sit and think about the characters and just how great the book was in general. I absolutely loved reading every part of the Hunger Games. I love its originality and how Suzanne Collins wrote it, the violence isn't too extreme for younger children and the characters are perfectly developed and grow throughout the story.   In short, this is one of the best books i've ever read (and ive read a lot of books).

B003ASLJRW|5.0|I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan. I think the movie itself is great but the quality of picture is terrific on Blu Ray. I have seen the movie before, but I wanted a copy of my own. For everyone that has a BluRay player and likes Clint Eastwood, this would be a good purchase.    After seeing the movie for about 3 times it dawned on me that Pale Rider was basically a remake of Shane starring Alan Ladd from the year 1953. Only the setting was changed, but the story was the same.

031603438X|3.0|Just finished the book. In a nut shell, it's ok reading if you are a fan.  Something to keep you mildly amused if you have nothing else to read, or do.  KR did a nice job talking about his childhood and family, but never brought them up again until 3/4 of the the way through the book. Never mentioned his relationship with his folks after he became sucessful. Matter of fact, his family , including his current wife, are not mentioned too much. Very little said about his relationships with his kids with Anita, and/or  current wife, Patti. He spent more time talking about his homies in Jamaica than his family in general.   KR also just glossed over his relationship with Brain Jones who was key player in the early days of the band. In the end, one doesn't really get a sense of who KR is.

0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is an excellent book because it is not only a good \\"story\\" is it extremely well written. I was amazed by the author's ability to weave in such intricate characters, the history, science and suspense. It's a page turner for sure. I didn't want it to end.    This is a book of fiction, which gives the author the right to do what she wants with it -- one review criticized the author for the improbability of the heroine to be a tenured professor at 35, athletic, and beautiful (which I don't think was the case). To that I say, are daemons, witches and vampires plausible?
0670022411|5.0|1st, this book is not a stand alone but is the 1st in a trilogy. I did not know this when I purchased this (noted inside the front flap only) and as I was reading became aware that there was no way they could wrap it up with the amount of book I had left so I went online to discover it was a trilogy.<br /><br />That being said... I really enjoyed this book! There are A lot of history references in this book and the story lines are laid out and well defined. It kept me turning the pages all the way to the end. The characters are well written and you really get a feel for them physically and emotionally.<br /><br />I did feel it started odd as it felt like they were trying to cram a bunch of back history in right at the start but once I go reading I didn't want to stop!<br /><br />I am really looking forward to the rest of the books coming out.<br /><br />Some have reviewed that the main character Dian is helpless and cared for through the whole book but I have a feeling that her strengths will come out and she will be quite the force and a strong character. This is only the 1st book and she is still trying to figure out her own magic and is quite uncertain of her powers (as is everyone around her).

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Dave and company have come out with a, (hopefully), game changer of an album. What a concept, a band playing real instruments, recording to analog tape in a garage? That's beautiful! No computers or auto tune? How can anyone possibly do that? A real ROCK BAND? Nah it can't be. BELIEVE IT!!!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|While it's extremely tough to choose between Making Movies or Dire Straits debut album, I have to say Making Movies might just possibly get the edge if one were to focus on *just* the songwriting and nothing else, however I believe the bands debut is better in terms of magnificent guitar soloing (not to mention the songwriting can stand on its own just fine) so perhaps Dire Straits first album should get the slight edge afterall.    Who cares about which album is better though.  I was NOT expecting Making Movies to blow me away as much as it did.  Oh sure, at first I thought a good portion of it was pretty average, and in fact, for years I hated \\"Skateaway\\" in particular because it always reminded me of a Bruce Springsteen wannabe track.  I was wrong and I admit it.  I had to pay attention to the lyrics that deal with a girl just enjoying her daily routine skating away through city streets while all the average people going about their lives stand back and admire the girls carefree lifestyle.  Now I have a newfound appreciation for it.  Sometimes, in specific instances, lyrics can make a MAJOR difference in quality, and this song is a fine example of that.    In fact, I highly recommend following along to the lyrics to every single track because doing so really enhances the experience.     Perhaps \\"Tunnel of Love\\" is Dire Straits attempt at an epic and majestic statement, what with the gorgeous and awe-inspiring piano line in the beginning and end of the track in addition to its lengthy 8-minute total amount of time, but the truth is, at its core it's basically written the same way as most of the songs released on the bands debut and Communique album.   Dire Straits weren't exactly the kind of band to branch beyond that comfortable formula they developed since the very beginning of their career, but in this case at least, I don't care one bit because \\"Tunnel of Love\\" might possibly be the bands very best song.  I absolutely love it.  Oh, and please pay exceptionallyclose attention to the carefully constructed guitar solo at the end.  It's fantastic.      I have to be honest about something concerning \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  I absolutely *despise* cheesy romantic lyrical themes in books, movies and yes, even music.  However because the song is basically repeating the same memorable vocal melody for the entirety of the track, I will make an exception in this particular case.  The lyrics still strike me as nothing more than fruity lovey dovey poetry though, which kind of stinks in my world.  The vocal melody though -and especially the sincere tone in Knopfler's voice- really wins me over.  Don't expect me to always be this forgiving though, haha.    Other tracks like \\"Expresso Love\\" contains a VERY melodic verse melody and chorus in addition to being really energetic and exciting.  Talk about a track that totally deserves to be considered in the same league as \\"Sultans of Swing\\".   It should definitely be in consideration for one of Dire Straits very best songs, melody-wise.    Speaking of memorable vocal melodies, how about the chorus in \\"Solid Rock?\\"  It's unbelievably good.  Once again, something about Knopfler really elevates the melody to new heights and the amount of sincerity he utilizes undoubtedly makes it a definitive classic in my book.      Some people have a problem with \\"Les Boys\\" because lyrically and musically it sounds *significantly* different from the rest of the album and interrupts the wonderful flow the album had going up until this point, but I don't care.  I find the vocal melody really catchy and bluesy in an old-fashioned kind of way, like a tribute of some kind.      I guess the only weak point is \\"Hand In Hand\\" because it's a slow-moving ballad with a predictable vocal melody and piano playing.  It's relatively short (at least, compared to the five songs that proceed it) so I honestly don't care a whole lot.  Besides, the run from \\"Tunnel of Love\\" through \\"Expresso Love\\" is 25 minutes of nonstop awesomeness that deservedly NEEDS a break so we can gather our wits and catch our breath, haha.    Overall, the only possible negative I can find is that the guitar soloing seems to take a back seat this time around so the songwriting can take its place in the spotlight.  A minor problem, honestly.  Also worth noting- with Making Movies it's now obvious Dire Straits didn't have any desire to step away from their comfort zone as far as attempting something different with their familiar style (a style I always believed was a mixture of light rock and light country elements).      Just a great album and a MUST own!
B004UXXVQS|5.0|This is a really great album.  Not a fan of Rope, but I should Have known and walk are nothing less than BRILLANT.  Best album of the year.
B00004Y6NU|2.0|No ladies and gentlemen- I'm no Dire Straits hater. I love their first three albums along with the somewhat overrated Brothers In Arms, but something is seriously wrong with Love Over Gold. It's like the energy, the songwriting, the vocal melodies and everything else that made Dire Straits so appealing to me has suddenly vanished, and what's even *more* mind-boggling is the fact that I'm apparently the only one who thinks so.     I despise a song like \\"It Never Rains\\". No interesting vocal melody to speak of and really bland and uninspiring lyrics- this song is an embarrassment. Dire Straits is significantly better than this. Is this the same band that just released Making Movies two years earlier? I must have played this song at least 10 times in the slim hope that it'd eventually win me over, but it's not clicking with me at *all*. \\"Yes it never rains around here- it just comes pouring down\\". Couldn't have said it any better myself.  Mark Knopfler was definitely listening to Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen during the recording of this song because his voice closely resembles both of them.  At least the final few minutes features a pretty solid guitar jam, definitely the ONLY reason to stay with it until the conclusion.     The title song is embarrassment number two. There's actually a boring marimba jam at the end, I kid you not. Of course featuring such a musical instrument only confirms my worst nightmares- that when the well finally runs dry for a band like Dire Straits they would sound absolutely forgettable and have no reason to exist. Honestly the signs of Dire Straits slipping into a \\"boredom groove\\" with zero concern for writing quality music was always a possibility, but now... it has finally happened. A song that goes nowhere, and once again, even giving it several chances to grow on me has not been met with any success (nor should it- hey, I don't mean to be cruel but this sounds like nothing more than boring adult contemporary hogwash to me).     Anyway, the title song features not only a marimba, but Spanish guitar and *extremely* generic piano playing that would surely make someone like Billy Joel rage with anger. I would even be willing to forgive the generic arrangements if the vocal melody actually went somewhere interesting. You just get the feeling had this song ever became a hit, that banks all across America would have been playing it frequently back in 1982.     I'm saving the biggest embarrassment for last- that being (and it's probably obvious) \\"Private Investigation\\". Oh boy. Dreadful, dreadful, dreadful, haha. It's like the title song but written in an even more generic and forgettable way.  This time there's no vocal melody at all- just pointless low-pitched whispering nonsense.    On a positive note, \\"Telegraph Road\\" is quite remarkable and basically another epic style (by Dire Straits standards, I mean) \\"Tunnel of Love\\".   It's also reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Thunder Road\\".  The vocal melody is decent, the lyrics are compelling and original (at least, I've certainly never heard anything like them) and the five minute guitar jam at the end is definitely incredible. Do NOT be fooled into thinking the rest of the material will even remotely resemble this track however, because it won't.     Another excellent song is \\"Industrial Disease\\". I bet when you first hear that opening organ riff you will think to yourself \\"Hey, a remixed version of \\"Walk of Life!\\" Nope, it's not that song (too bad, haha). It IS the best song on the album.   It actually contains an energetic vocal melody- imagine that!  It seriously sounds WAY out of place- it should have been the final track on Making Movies.    PLEASE pick up Making Movies instead. That one is easily *much* more enjoyable because it contains most of the ingredients that made Dire Straits such a great band for the first three years of their existence.  Just forget Love Over Gold was ever made.
1594484805|1.0|I bought this book thinking it was about, as the title says, finding the truth about what motivates me and how to use different applicable techniques to focus better on work and be actually motivated to do it. Instead, this book mainly gives economic advice (in an academic research tone) to corporate world managers, or rather executives who manage many people and are looking to motivate their employees. Granted, I'm sure its target audience could find it very interesting to pick at, but it didn't have any good tips for me at all. I wish the title wasn't so misleading.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|We have loved Les Mis for over 20 years.  We own the previous concert version, also, but always regretted that it was not released in a 16:9 format with DD 5.1 sound.  This version does one better to that wish list and adds 1080P Blu-Ray HD.  So technically, this is the version to own if you have the hardware to display it.  In our case we have a projection system with a 92\\" screen and sound to match.  I put it together myself and it cost less than most 55\\" LCDs.  For this kind of program THAT becomes an event that's better than being there -- the popcorn is better (and cheaper) and our feet don't stick to the floor:)<br /><br />As to the performance, well, we love Colm Wilkinson in the first concert but we always wondered how the piece would be with a \\"real\\" tenor (ala Placido Domingo). Alfie Boe comes close to that ideal.  It's a whole different Val Jean.  Wonderful !!  Norm Lewis as Javert keeps up with the main protagonist with a more than menacing but nuanced performance.  Lea Salonga is a repeat from the previous cast, albeit, playing a different part.  She is so familiar with this work that she could probably sing ALL the parts if she had to.  She's always enthralling.  The rest of the cast fill their respective roles with distinction.  Marius doesn't bother me as much as he does some reviewers.<br /><br />So this Blu-Ray has it all.  It may be the single BEST Blu-Ray I have acquired because it is live HDTV rather than a Blu-Ray of a film.  Most films don't have the resolution of which Blu-Ray is capable.  Blu-Ray shines best when the original material was shot in HD video.  That is the case here and, along with a stunning performance and real sense of occasion, it ends up being our favorite Blu-Ray of the many we have.
0316069353|4.0|See story summaries above.<br />Michael Connelly did a good job overall with The Fifth Witness.

1594202842|3.0|I give the book three stars because it seems to me an honest account of the author's family life.  It's even funny at times, when I'm not aching for her daughters.  I listened to the audio book read by Ms Chua herself and she reads well.  She's certainly very talented.  Otherwise I'd rate the book one star.<br /><br />Ms Chua claims herself a representative of Chinese mothers.  I'm a native Chinese and came to this country with an advanced degree earned in China -- I'm no stranger to educating children the Chinese way.  Yet I don't treat my children as she does and I know that most of the Chinese in the US (and in China, for that matter) don't \\"educate\\" their children in that extreme fashion.  From reading the book I believe that her philosophies and behaviors are largely due to her seriously flawed personality.  I list some revealing examples below.  Since I don't have the paper copy handy, my quotes are not accurate to every word.<br /><br />* When she learned that her dog was not among the most intelligent breeds, she felt \\"nauseated\\".  To her, everyone,  everything is a tool for competition.<br /><br />* She bitterly criticizes the American \\"shopping mall\\" materialism. Yet she herself is a huge spender.  To celebrate her daughter's Carnegie Hall debut, she threw a party that cost the family's winter AND summer vacations.  How she spends her money is her own business.  But condemning others for going to the mall?  That sounds hypocritical to me.<br /><br />* She has a strong sense of superiority that shows here and there throughout the book.  She says some white men have \\"yellow fever\\". They would date any Asian woman, \\"no matter how ugly she is and what part of Asia she is from\\".  That's deeply racist and offending.<br /><br />* When I started reading the book, I puzzled over her statement \\"This is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs.\\"  Where is her husband?  It turns out he is the rock, the sane parent in the family.  Then I find it extremely arrogant for Ms Chua to omit her husband's essential role in the story.  Why mention only the daughters and the dogs?  Because they can be controlled and bent by Ms Chua's will of steel?<br /><br />Overall, I feel Ms Chua's story has less to do with being Chinese and more with her extreme, distorted world view.essential role in the story.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|This album is appropriately titled \\"Wasting Light\\" because it is a darker album than previous offerings from the Foo Fighters.      Pat Smear rejoins Grohl and the Fighters for this album, a curious mix of odd time changes, guitar hooks and multi-layered mania. I won't break it down track-by-track for you, but I will tell you you're in for some post-grunge angst in tunes like \\"One of These Days,\\" as well as the full-blown scream fest called \\"White Limo.\\" I think my favorite track is \\"Arlandria,\\" and you certainly don't want to miss \\"Miss the Misery,\\" but it's awfully hard to narrow it down on an album when ALL the songs are good.    As an old fan of the Foo Fighters, I've always appreciated that the band has been able to change its sound without losing its \\"sound.\\"  Wasting Light is no exception: It sounds like the Foo Fighters, but it also sounds like a brand new Foo.

B002ZG99QS|1.0|I waited to see this movie on DVD, as the movie reviews were not too good.  The original Tron was a simple, OK film.  Tron Legacy is something else.  It is complex, relying on special effects instead of a good story.  This DVD goes into my \\"donate\\" bin, not a keeper.
0312427999|2.0|I get a kick out of books that look to explain complex systems with one simple formula.  This book tries to be a book like that, claiming that adherents of free-market reforms (Milton Friedman, et al) wait for giant disasters to occur in order to implement... wait a minute!  Not free-market reforms, but big-government-backed corporate partnerships.  Is it possible that Klein misunderstands Milton Friedman's economics?  Not only possible, but likely.<br /><br />Naomi Klein believes that the way to just societies is through \\"pooling wealth.\\" The plain truth is that the free market leads to unequal outcomes.  You're never going to close that gap, and certainly not with THIS book - which looks at the failure of Progressive policies to improve people's lives and then recommends MORE Progressive policies.  Faster and harder, until morale improves.<br /><br />Her work is sometimes entertaining to read, but this book relies too much on  personal interviews with unnamed civilians, quotes from \\"my sources,\\" and mysterious circumstances-suspicions-rumors.  It's your basic wishful thinking/conspiracy theorizing/Michael Moore-emulating partisan nonsense, flavored with complaints about hyper-partisanship.  I particularly like when credible authors quote, not from research, but from the EDITORIAL PAGES of major newspapers.  That's this book.<br /><br />In order to believe what Naomi Klein believes, you would have to look at the 1980s and conclude that Friedman-style *economic reforms* were the driving force behind the Falklands and Yugoslavia.  Similarly, it is LAUGHABLE to imagine (as Klein does) that 9-11-01 ushered in an era of free-market capitalism, rather than instituting big-government expansions.<br /><br />Do giant disasters tend to leave people less free, at least for a while?  Yes, but not due to any capitalistic economic breakthroughs, as Naomi Klein hypothesizes.  Big disasters tend to bring us more government, which leaves us less free.<br /><br />In reading this book (written in 2007), one can not help but wonder whether her head has not exploded under Barack Obama's policies.  The \\"corporatist state\\" is linked ever more closely to the current US Administration, with ties between the US Government and Wall Street and Big Business not even raising eyebrows anymore.  But to have this happen under a Democrat-led government... who do these folks plan to vote for next time? (Klein is Canadian and can't vote in US elections)<br /><br />To sum up: I can agree with Naomi Klein's basic idea.  In times of disaster, DON'T WAIT for the government.  And don't trust what they tell you.  Protect your own.<br /><br />But this book is poorly argued, poorly researched, and poorly written.t wonder whether her head has not exploded under Barack Obama's policies.

0634022296|5.0|if you love the Beatles, you'll love this songbook.   I'm a beginner at guitar but I had no trouble learning a few songs within the first week I received this book.  It has a nice range of very hard songs and easy songs, and I like how it is written in chord format rather than guitar tab format (tablature is much harder than learning chords, in my opinion).  It would be hard to get bored with this, as you can customize the songs and learn fingerpickings as you increase your guitar skills. Pretty much anyone can pick up this book and already be learning Beatles songs.  Here's some songs that are my favorites and are fairly easy:  I Want to Hold Your Hand  She Loves You (Yeah Yeah Yeah)  Eleanor Rigby

The movie did a nice job of both staying true to the concepts of the television series while also extending the story line and filling in some explanations about Summer and about the Reavers.  The loss of a character was shocking and disappointing, but not inappropriate to the nature of the Firefly story.

This is and always will be a great and successful book. I highly recommend this book.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|The Naked and Famous has single-handedly changed my entire taste in music. It is the album by which I shall judge all others before I buy them. I first ordered the mp3 only version of this album back in late 2010 and haven't stopped listening to it since. I loved it so much that I bought the $30 deluxe version just to listen to more songs from the EPs (not to mention stare at the band's signatures).     Guided by the powerfully unique vocals of Alisa Xayalith and the endless creativity of Thom Powers, \\"Passive Me, Aggressive You\\", in contrast to its title, floors you with waves of sound very much like My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\", while often driving anthem-like choruses into your head until you can't help but sing them out loud. However, it's difficult to pin TNAF in a certain style, ranging from spacey synthesizers in \\"Punching in a Dream\\" to raging guitar noise (probably inspired by Billy Corgan solos) in \\"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\\", and the driving beats of \\"All of This\\" to the ballad-like \\"Jilted Lovers\\". Just listen to \\"No Way\\" and you'll hear all of the aforementioned in one song - simply epic. As if the music itself wasn't emotionally charged enough, the lyrics bring to mind the heartache of lovers in peril and the frustration of the teenage years.    All of my raving raises an interesting question: \\"Is this album so good that no one, not even the band themselves, can top it?\\" The answer, in my opinion, is yes - how can you, when there's no comparison?
0743298020|4.0|I was captivated by the prose.<br /><br />It was careful but not fussy, lyrical but not forced and dramatic but not theatrical.<br /><br />The characters felt real and three dimensional and I cared about them, which is the primary benchmark, for me, in terms of whether I consider a book \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". I can forgive a lot of grammar, style and plotting weaknesses if I love the characters.<br /><br />The story itself is a little \\"meh\\" - but I have begun to believe the adage that there are only so many basic stories and a million and one ways to present them. When you have read as many stories as I have, a little sense of the \\"been there and done that\\" sets in.<br /><br />This is the work of a professional writer - someone who has studied the craft and understands not only the subtleties of story telling but the powerful ways in which our language can be wielded to achieve that goal.<br /><br />I liked it a lot.
1400079144|2.0|Like most negative commentors here I came to this book as a fan of Mr. Brown. I've read all of his novels. In fact, reading his work is one of my guilty pleasures. Therefore it is with some sadness that I must agree with those who also found this book to be a major disappointment.<br /><br />Many have been critical of Mr. Brown's narrative style.  Sure, I get their points; but that complaint does not account for why I have rated TLS so low. I can live with stylistic shortcomings, but only if the author manages to keep me intrigued.<br /><br />No, my problem lies with the the \\"mystery\\" that forms the premise of the book. The most conspiracy-linked organization in the world, Freemasonry, turns out to be the grand protector of American mores and \\"The Ancient Mysteries.\\" The CIA, the second-most conspiracy-linked organization in the world, acting out of sterling motivations, turns out to be freemasonry's ally. And that was the best Dan Brown could do with the raw material. ZZZZZZ. And this is the same author who turned Opus Dei into a muderous organization of vengeful thugs.<br /><br />The revelations along the way are equally pedestrian: And what if the general public found out that many of America's Presidents, Congressmen, and Supreme Court Justices were freemasons! Panic would ensue ...  NOT! Did you know that the Smithsonian has a statue of a half-naked Washington, modeled after Zeus Olympios! Holy erect nipples! And what about the pyramids, and stuff like Rosicrucians, and 2012! Eh ... never mind. It's all patched together so loosely it amounts to nothing.<br /><br />I just wish I were exaggerating. The MOST interesting parts of the book were the magic squares. Mr. Brown's devoted interest in cryptology pays off by providing some much needed wonder to offset the dull tale of nothing much at all.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This is the second grip I own.  The first one I bought was for my primary camera, the 5D MK II.  Because the batteries are the same for the two cameras, I first thought I would be able to interchange the battery grip.  However I wanted one for each camera so I wouldn't have to constantly switch it over to the one I was using at that particular time.  Fortunately I didn't just get online and order the grip for the 5D because, though it may or may not be compatible, it would lack the M. Fn. button that is unique to that of the 7D, allowing you to quickly and easily change autofocus modes as well as any other functions that I haven't explored yet on the 7D.      I was pleased with the price of the grip.  I seem to remember the 5D grip costing more at the time of its purchase.  The benefits of the grip go beyong the initial capability to house two batteries (or a battery cartridge containing 6 AA batteries!).  I enjoy having something substantial to hold onto while handling my camera, and it provides somewhat of a shelf for your small finger to rest on.  Additionally, it offers you the same controls as the camera has on the top right edge:  the shutter button, the previously mentioned M Fn. button, the dial for changing shutter speed, etc., the AF-On button, the AF selection button, and the exposure lock * button, eliminating the need to awkwardly reach over the camera in a vertical shooting scenario.      As I read on the review for the 5D MK II grip prior to purchasing it, the grip facilitates vertical shooting in such a way that users are more likely to take these shots and get that portrait composition that works better for some subjects and gives a unique perspective on some as well.  If it's easier to shoot landscape style shots, that's what the majority of a person's pictures will be.  With this grip providing you the same access to controls as a horizontal shot, you can just as easily add vertical shots to your portfolio.  The grip also conveniently allows you to store the original battery compartment door inside the original battery compartment, so it will be there (not at home in a box) should you decide to remove the grip and pack light.      I tend to agree with those who say that once you get a grip for one of your cameras, it'll be hard to be without one for the rest of the cameras you purchase.  I have no experience with off-brand products, and I know that people say you're paying for the name on this, but I come from the school that you get what you pay for, even if that means you have to pay for the name on top of the quality.  These are electronics and it is rather difficult to get your money back out of them, so I would recommend getting what you want the first time instead of coming to realize that the \\"just as good for less\\" product doesn't cut it and then paying for this name brand and using the off-brand for a paper weight.  Just my two cents though, and its your money so spend it how you like!

1843106698|5.0|I have attended seminars on the subject so I considered myself somewhat educated before I began reading the book but the wealth of information that the book presents was a welcomed surprise.  The book is easy to read and presents practical suggestions throughout.  As a therapist working with both young children and young adults diagnosed and not yet diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome the book identifies typical behavior and explanations for them.  It was so gratifying to tell a mom of a 7 year old that her son's \\"picky eating\\" was a common trait among AS kids.<br />Attwood did recommend a dvd program for teaching emotion and when I read the two review of it on Amazon I chose not to buy it.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I have been into Foo Fighters since I first saw \\"Ill Stick Around\\" on MTV back when they still played new rock videos (or any music at all I guess).  However, over time it always had bothered me that no matter how cool Dave was or how many great singles the band had, there was no end-to-end solid album.  The s/t album I loved but it had lots of straight out noise-rock that wasn't for most people.  \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" had a decent amount of filler that seemed thrown in, despite several killer songs. \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\" mellowed out too hard on the back end despite a nice vibe.  Their next three albums were all 3 or 4 awesome songs and a bunch of paint by number bores.  \\"Wasting Light\\" has the same awesome singles still, but is the first Foo album where I feel that every track is strong.  They aren't all masterpieces, but there are no duds, not even close.  I'd give \\"Back and Forth\\", probably the weakest track, an 8/10.  It's still a catchy and interesting AOR song-something I'd never say about two/thirds of the songs they released starting with \\"One by One\\".  This is great news for the band, and for the fans too!

B002XUL6RG|3.0|HUNGER (2007), the first effort by director Steve McQueen, is a dramatization of the 1981 hunger strike carried out by IRA prisoners in Northern Ireland. Seeing themselves as political prisoners, these men demanded to wear their own clothes instead of prison uniforms, have greater visiting rights, and be free from prison work. The most prominent participant in the strike was Bobby Sands, who died after 66 days without food.<br /><br />The film can be divided into three parts. The first presents the prison conditions that the men suffered before the strike. We see this routine through the eyes of two minor prisoners and a guard. Beatings are regular, the prisoners are left naked with only a single blanket to cover themselves with in freezing weather, and For the most part, the prison officials are portrayed as brutal automatons as stripped of their humanity as the Roman soldiers on Gaudi's Sagrada Familia, which makes the pangs of conscience of a couple of them all the more moving. The second part is a hinge in the action. Sands (Michael Fassbender) comes to the forefront, explaining his motives to a priest (Liam Cunningham) in an ambitious 17-minute single shot. Finally, the last third of the film tracks Sands' weakening and death. Sands' deterioration -- he's soon covered with sores and reduced to a skeleton -- is graphic, and one wonders how the filmmakers did it, because it seems to go well beyond mere makeup effects.<br /><br />For someone unfamiliar with the Troubles, the prison conditions were sad and outrageous, as if prisoners were treated like this in the early 1980s, then the West was compromising its values of humanity and justice. HUNGER thus introduced me to a sorry episode in recent history and it's valuable for that. However, I'm uncomfortable with the latter half of the story, which goes beyond the principle that everyone, even the incarcerated, deserves humane treatment. Sands is portrayed not only as a man standing up for better treatment in prison, but as a soldier with wider political goals, a lingering desire to unite Ireland by violence. There's also touches of religious symbolism, Sands as Christ figure, which is too pat and downright offensive considering he was an incarcerated terrorist. Yes, even the message that even criminals deserve fair treatment is a noble one, but you've still got to acknowledge that the man's political designs were heinous.<br /><br />Still, even if the plot is irksome and a couple of shots seem like padding (what's up with the long floor-mopping scene?), there are some fine aspects of the film. The set design is meticulous. Cunningham brings the air of an experienced stage actor into the film, which works surprisingly well. I suspect McQueen will progress to great things and I'm curious to see his future work.ier with wider political goals, a lingering desire to unite Ireland by violence.

B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|The movie is 5 stars (if they had 10 it would get a 10). This blu-ray transfer gets a very high 4 stars (but still ... not quite perfect!).<br /><br />This Blu-ray transfer of Kurosawa's Ran is by far the best version I've personally seen (I've owned VHS, Laserdisc, and early DVD versions). The movie itself is one of the jaw-dropping cinematographic works of the 20th century and there's nothing I can add to the numerous reviews and analyses which universally, and rightfully, praise this film. Having seen the original in theaters I may never be satisfied with ANY transfer.<br /><br />Ok, I watched this on a 40 inch HDTV with built-in and simulated surround sound. I was enchanted, entranced, and spellbound. If NOT for having seen the original I would be raving about this to my friends. Now all I want is an 80 inch HDTV with 8 speakers strategically placed in a room specifically designed and dedicated for cinema.<br /><br />Until then, this will do.

Her book actually served as a fun checklist for us to follow with our girls when we started the bedtime routine. My girls would see how the animals had to brush their teeth and pick out their pj's and they wanted to do the same. They also loved the idea of exercising a little before bed which helped tire them out just a little bit more. Thank you Sandra for all your lovely books. We have enjoyed each and every one of them!

B0041KKYBK|5.0|It is always a problem with such investigatory docos to know how much is true and false. Michael Moore's films suffered a lot from that. Here one had the unmistakable feeling that not only was it all true but even worse we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg! The shameless attitude of the financial leaders of the United States who basically caused the meltdown through financial greed and criminal self interest is just disgusting to behold. Even more scandalous is the way they have effectively bullied and bribed the US government to not only let them off the hook and be allowed to keep their ill-gotten gains, but now they are back to their old ways again and we the stupid gullible public are paying for their party. None of the perpetrators and those responsible for regulating the finance industry have been punished and most have taken home hundreds of millions in what amounts to legalised theft!<br />There will never be another doco like this. See it and see it again and again and try not to be caught out yourself. The old adage that a fool and his money are soon parted was never more true and the financial leaders of the US have proved that with a vengeance! Fantastic but what an inditement of US financial policy!

Thats the point. Its suppose to. It kind of adds to the feel of the series... Trying not to give to many spoilers. I got hooked after I watched Serenity this is a great series and glad I got this. Mine was a slim case however, not that thats a bad thing but from the picture it looks like its not the slim case. 4 disk with added bonus features which honestly I don't watch... Just the kind of fan I am...
B003Y5H51K|1.0|This film was just an embarrassment.  The characters were total cliche.  The dialog was wooden.  The suspense and action were pedestrian.  And to add insult to injury, the sets and effects were completely fake and cheesy-looking.  The exterior shots were beautiful, but when it came to showing the cave interiors, they were clearly sets, and very poor ones at that.<br /><br />James Cameron should be ashamed to have his name associated with this awful movie.  No matter how much you are tempted, I'm telling you, don't waste two hours of your life watching this utterly mediocre bore.

B002LLE3PY|5.0|I don't understand the review by Syd because my versions of In the Court of the Crimson King and Islands have 5.1 and stereo versions of the whole original album.  I am very satisfied with the audio quality for what it is, compressed digital.  Also, if you want an original version that's not compressed, buy the vinyl.  It has a wider dynamic range when you play it or you can record it to digital using a good quality turntable, a preamp and software.  Actually the sound quality of originals is always different dependent on your equipment you play it on and the sonic properties of the room you play it in.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Add me to the list of people raving about this release. In this day of contrived television talent competitions and auto-tune, it's so refreshing to hear a band that just flat-out rocks straight from the very core of their souls. Every so often the universe brings together those that are incredibly talented in and of themselves, but when brought together as a group, bring us something truly memorable. The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who and some others come to mind...and in the same vain, I see the Foo Fighters as a very, very special band that will be remembered for many years to come. This album, like their previous releases, is a reflection of their pure talent and ability. Nothing artificial here...this is just great rock and roll executed on a level that is slowly, but surely, vanishing. Grab this one and enjoy it while you can. I won't review each track simply because I think they are all very good.  Sure, some are better than others, but there's not a weak song in the bunch, in my opinion.  A couple of the tracks that really grabbed me:  \\"These Days\\" - From the moment I heard this song, it absolutely spoke to me on a level that I never expected. Cathartic is an absolute understatement!  Also, \\"I Should Have Known\\" is just a beautiful lyrical masterpiece.  All in all, a top-flight album by a top-flight band!

I'm new to graphic novels, but I find them to be fascinating in the sense that they grant readers an image to start up their imaginations, but still leave a lot up to the reader.     Only downside: I read this in about a day. Now I'm waiting anxiously for vol. 2. I would perhaps recommend that a prospective reader would go ahead and invest the extra $10-15 and get the book which contains I think 12 issues.     But overall, excellent read!

B004P02OJ6|5.0|Just how unconditional is unconditional love? This film tries to answer this question.    Russell Crowe delivers a sterling performance as John Brennan, and Elizabeth Banks most convincingly portrays his wife, Lara. Soon after the film begins Lara is charged with the murder of her boss, with whom she had recently quarreled. There is overwhelming, apparently unassailable, evidence of Lara's guilt. She is convicted and sentenced to life in prison.    John is deeply in love with Lara and remains convinced of her innocence after a three years' appeal process goes nowhere. So, he takes the giant (incredible) step of plotting to break Lara out of jail. He is a straight-arrow community college instructor, not the hardened felon type associated with jail breaks.    I don't want to say anything more about the plot, but the tale took some intriguing twists that certainly held my attention. As the final credits rolled, following a stirring conclusion, I remember thinking that this was an outstanding film. Then I started to reflect. Some things just did not add up. I realized that I had to deny \\"common sense\\" to buy into the story.    But, hey, I'll still give it five stars.

B004QMRHHW|4.0|I really don't want to be too harsh, because I think Amon Amarth put out a great album. Just for me, personally, I wish there were more songs like War of the Gods. I really appreciated the balance between the hard and fast songs and the slower, more deliberate songs on the last three albums (Twilight of the Thunder God, With Oden on our Side, Fate of Norns). Not that one was better than the other, but I loved the dark, rhythmic melodies even more when they were augmented by the harsh, thrashing, energetic songs. Unfortunately, after War of the Gods, there aren't any other songs that match that ferocity on the album, and the album seemed more somber and oppressive than the last ones. Still a great album, but if you are looking for the fast paced songs, there's not much many options.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|'Scenes from a Memory' was a progressive masterpiece, and (in my opinion) was one of the greatest albums of all time. Its successor, 'Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence' featured some admirable experimentation while still managing to remain a delight to listen to. After these two brilliant pieces of work, 'Train of Thought' was always going to be met with ridiculous expectation from the Dream Theater fan base. Released in 2003, 'Train of Thought' was met with mixed opinions, because, on this release, Dream Theater had taken a slightly different direction - for the first time, the prog aspects of DT's music had been pushed into the background somewhat, while the heavy metal elements had been brought to the forefront. On this occasion, Dream Theater beared less of a resemblance to Rush, Frank Zappa, or Fates Warning, and more of a likeness to the musical stylings of Metallica. The harder, more guitar-driven direction, and the greater prominence of 4/4 beats made 'Train of Thought' a rather difficult pill to swallow for many DT fans (which is evident from the amount of 1-star ratings we have on this item's product page). However, while the approach on this disc is heavier and more simplistic than most of DT's previous albums, there's no denying that there's still a high level of quality on this album. I personally get a great level of enjoyment from each on of the tracks on this album...    \\"As I Am\\" - 9/10  This is perhaps the worst offender on the album for simplicity and basic song structure. This really wouldn't sound too out of place on a Metallica album. But the thing is, if this song WERE to appear on a Metallica album, it would no-doubt be an absolute standout, be considered one of their best songs and become a cult classic. That's because the song has some amazing riffage, an incredible solo from Mr. Petrucci, and some very impressive choice and structure of lyrics. However, there's only one reason why I can't give this track a ten, and that's due to the repetition. I have to admit that the chorus doesn't match the brilliance and listen-ability or the verses or the soloing, and it's probably heard in the song one too many times, and it actually becomes a little grinding to listen to by the end of the song. That being said, this is a terrific song, and is one that I've used to spark numerous peoples' interest in Dream Theater.    \\"This Dying Soul\\" - 10/10  Following on directly from \\"As I Am\\", \\"This Dying Soul\\" hits the ground running at full speed; double-kick in constant motion accompanied by another driving guitar riff. After a brief but effective solo from Petrucci, the band then enters seamlessly into a slow, powerful and articulate riff which is almost indescribably likeable. This then drops off into a quiet section upon which LaBrie can soulfully deliver his first lines of the song. So, within the first 2-and-a-half minutes, we hear three vastly different sections of music that fit together perfectly. This is essentially how things continue throughout the rest of the track, with this song taking the listener through a musical journey which features an incredible array of progressive metal brilliance. Also, I can't finish this track review without commending the outtro of this song; the final two minutes demonstrate exactly why John Petrucci is such a respected guitarist in the rock & metal world. It must be heard to be believed; it rivals his soloing in the latter half of \\"Fatal Tragedy.\\"    \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" - 10/10*  I have nothing bad to say about this track. It opens as a slow, sentimental ballad, before building towards a rather heavy chorus (a chorus which is actually better than the verses, as opposed to \\"As I Am\\"). This verse and chorus are repeated once more before the band then enter into one of their trademark jams. Though heavier than most of their instrumental sections, it still features much experimentation and weirdness, which is exemplified by Jordan Rudess' obscure keyboard solo at around the 6-and-a-half-minute mark. Speaking of Rudess, I was happy to find that he was much more audible in the mix of \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"This Dying Soul\\", unlike \\"As I Am\\", in which he is a little drowned out by everything else. This jam continues to build throughout the song, taking it to new levels; if you were to suddenly skip back to the beginning, you would hardly believe you were listening to the same song. Eventually, this jam reaches its climax, before the band enter back into the chorus and finish the song in an extremely powerful way (which one must hear for themselves to properly appreciate). I would rate this track just above \\"This Dying Soul\\", on account of the fact that it builds slowly towards a crescendo, rather than being a series of impressive solos, riffs and arrangements. This is one of the two tracks on the album that I would actually describe as 'truly epic'.    \\"Honor Thy Father\\" - 9.5/10  Depending on my mood, this track can either be a nine or a ten, so I've decided to moderate. This is one of the most aggressive Dream Theater songs I've heard, and this is for a reason too, as the song's lyrical content deals with Mike Portnoy describing his relationship towards his stepfather (and obviously he is not too fond of him). The track features such harsh lyrics as \\"You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man\\", and \\"Never in my life have I seen someone, So ignorant to the damage he has done, You're the rotted root in the family tree.\\" Such lyrics are complimented by the musical aspect of the track, with the song opening with a harsh and heavy riff, the type of which is very uncommon in Dream Theater's music. This heavy riffing continues throughout the entirety of track, but is juxtaposed by quiet moments in which LaBrie quietly delivers Mike Portnoy's abrasive lyrics. Also, the heaviness is balanced out by the keyboard, which gives an almost symphonic vibe to the music, thus adding some sophistication to this harsh and reactionary piece of music. Unlike most songs that act as outright personal attacks, this track possesses a level of credibility, which is found in the well-written lyrics, the large array of quality riffs, the impressive instrumentation, and the genuine power that the track has. That's the difference - this track doesn't just sound angry, but it sounds powerful, and it sounds inspired; Portnoy has translated his negative experiences into something of quality, rather than writing various insults and putting them over the top of a flat and uninspired piece of music. But, unlike most DT songs, I can't listen to this whenever I want. If I'm in a calm mood, I will generally not warm to this track, but if I'm feeling anything from apathy to frustration, then I can really appreciate the power that this song conveys.    \\"Vacant\\" - 9.5/10  In absolute contrast to \\"Honor Thy Father\\", \\"Vacant\\" serves up a nice, quiet, calm and emotional piece of acoustic music. After the heaviness of the last four tracks, this song is really nice to sit and listen to, and just soak in. It's the calm after the storm, and the time when you can rest your ears and your brain, and just appreciate the melodies of James LaBrie's voice, Rudess' piano, and Eugene Friesen's cello. This track serves three purposes: a) a quality piece of enjoyable music, b) a peaceful interval which separates the first two thirds of the album from the latter third, and c) as an introduction to the mammoth instrumental that is to follow.    \\"Steam of Consciousness\\" - 9.5/10  We now leap plunge into \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" - the album's instrumental track. Running at over 11 minutes, we are given a absolute overload of impressive instrumentation from Petrucci, Rudess, Portnoy and John Myung, as each of these immensely talented musicians progress through a series of varying musical styles and sections. Each musician compliments the other in everything that they play on their respective instruments, as the sounds produced by each of theme weave and intertwine with one-another's in order to create some incredible pieces of mindblowing music. This track serves to showcase exactly why these men are idolized by so many aspiring musicians. Though the track gets a little repetitive by the end, it is still a pleasure to listen to, and is right up there is Dream Theater's previous instrumentals such as \\"Dance of Eternity\\" and \\"Erotomania.\\"    \\"In the Name of God\\" - 10/10*  My oh my, does it get much better than this? I think not. For the full 14 minutes that this track runs, the listener is met with nothing but quality and excellence which will hold their attention for the entire duration. The song opens with one of Dream Theater's greatest and catchiest riffs ever. Following this intro, the song goes through many stages and transitions that range from a slow, powerful and anthemic chorus, to Metallica-esque, guitar driven sections, to quiet jams, to frantic and up-beat jams, to ridiculously fast guitar soloing, and other interesting arrangements, with each managing to share a common musical theme. I love everything about this track; every minute of it; every aspect of it; every section, whether it be heavy, soft, fast or slow. It's a very well-written song, musically. The lyrics also should not go without mention. The subject matter of the song deals with religious corruption and holy war, speaking of those who transform religion into a violent, evil killing machine; who twist otherwise peaceful belief systems into something in which to perform acts of evil and create suffering. This serious issue is conveyed and explained quite well by Petrucci (the song's lyricist), as he is able to string powerful sentences and strong passages together by using rather articulate vocabulary and clever choice of wording. Combined with the music, Petrucci uses his wonderful lyrical abilities to powerfully convey his message and discuss his disapproval of this issue.  The track finally draws to a close with a repeat of the chorus, before closing with a strong and emotional piece of music in which the piano can be heard most prominently. The ending is only given enhanced power by LaBrie's amazing vocal performance, which is arguably the best he has ever given. In the final minute of the song, \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" can be heard in the background. This both brings another effective element into the music, as well as providing some contextual relevance. Once the track reaches its final stages, I usually get chills; it's just such a powerful song which is consistently brilliant from start to finish. It is a truly amazing, monumental progressive metal epic which all self-respecting rock and metal listeners should hear at least once in their lifetime.    I once read a post from a user on Last.fm which read something like \\"\\"In the Name of God\\" is undoubtedly the best song on 'ToT'. It could have saved the whole album if it needed to.\\" And this basically sums up my feelings on both the song and the album; 'Train of Thought' is worth owning purely for \\"In the Name of God\\", but luckily there's a huge amount of quality throughout the rest of the album too. However, many DT fans do seem to miss this quality or simply pass over it due to the fact that this album is different to most of the others in the band's catalogue. It's unfortunate that this album isn't given a fair chance by many DT fans simply because is structurally and musically different. Dream Theater aren't compromising or \\"selling out\\" in any way by adopting more of a mainstream metal approach, because their musical traits can still be found within this album; they're just found in different areas and perhaps not quite as prominent or pronounced as on other albums. This album still features amazing instrumentation, great lyrics, excellent musicianship and chemistry, and well thought-out arrangements; they're just done in a slightly different manner than they are on previous releases such as 'Scenes from a Memory' or 'Images and Words.' I urgeall Dream Theater fans to listen to this album with an open mind and a degree of acceptance for new musical directions. Because, when it comes down to it, when have Dream Theater released two albums that are musically similar or stylistically identical? Never. They're always exploring new territory, experimenting and trying new things; progressing, in other words. This time, they wanted to try their hand at Metallica-esque heavy metal covered in a thick layer of 'proginess', and they pulled it off brilliantly. This music is some of the best heavy metal you'll hear, and it's far beyond the capabilities of most bands (if not all bands) on the metal scene.

However, other aspects of the novel such as the dialogue and the political structures described in the plot seem almost retrospective; the supreme ruler is known as the Emperor, and is addressed as Your Majesty by his subjects, while the typical entertainments are ministrel singing and sword fighting. This book depicts the story of Paul Atreides, a boy of fifteen raised in Castle Caladan,and who is the son of the local Duke.  His mother, a member of the  Bene Gesserit female-only society, had been instructed to bear only daughters, but she disobeyed this command because of the Duke's wish for a son for his heir.  Jessica trains Paul  in the hope that he will be the first male Bene Gesserit. However, at the same time, Paul must train to be the next Duke. These two responsibilities combine to present a formidable challenge for Paul.      This novel was very intriguing; it made me think deeply about every single event that happens along the storyline; Frank Herbert gives just enough information about a situation to make the reader curious, but leaves out some details to give the story a mysterious air. When I started the book, I was confused with all the new and strange terms, but as I delved further into the story, the new language became more familiar and enhanced the reading experience. The book is also very suspenseful and is filled with many memorable passages: \\"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.\\" This early excerpt, part of a calming Bene Gesserit ritual, foreshadows many frightening scenes to come. All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the combination of science fiction, mystery, and thrill.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|This book is a fascinating tale of Portia's battle with anorexia. As a person who diets a lot, but has never struggled anywhere near as much as her, I was amazed at the times when I related to her tale. Given, there were also times when I thought, \\"Wow, this poor girl. What was she thinking?\\"<br />I'm so happy for her now that she's recovered. It is an excellent story worth reading.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Just picked this up and it's a great viewer for the Xoom.  Definitely better than Aldiko (no force closes yet).  Simple to use and the voice reader is a nice touch.
B003VS0CXI|5.0|We are very pleased with this Blu-ray disc.  The detail is amazing as with the sound. It was like watching the movie for the first time. The movie was viewed on a Samsung 1080p 3-D plasma and a Samsung Blu-ray 3-D player.
B004G600A4|5.0|i'm trying not to spoil anything ... but read at your own risk anyways. Ok now, first off I want to say that i'm a 26 year old and a bit of a movie freak, and i love disney movies in particular. I watched The princess and the frong when it came out and was so let down it was half hearted attempt from disney and it had a couple of cute momments but overall a huge disapointment. Having said that i can now say this, i was really doubtful when they released tangled, i mean after all i grew up in the second golden age of disney amimation, little mermaid, beauty and the beast, ect ect..  nothing could compare, until now.. i was shocked at how great this movie truely is, the animation is stellar, i mean the lantern secne  was so moving and beautiful,  it even topped the ball room secne from beauty and the beast, the voice acting was amazing i was kinda worried when i heard Mandy Moore was playing rapunzel, but happy to be proven wrong. the characters were well rounded, and the sidekicks are great. The music is catchy * even if it takes a couple of viewings* and brought to you by the always great Allen Menken. the last few secnes had me to tears. I was more then happy to find myself back in a real fairy tale story,where you can once again believe in a happily ever after, and if you read the story of Rapunel there are little things from the original fairy tale that are present in the re-telling if you look for them. So after a long long long absence, welcome back Disney, to what made you great.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Really big but also really well designed. I have an matx board and the RAM in the slots closest to the processor fit right under the fan on this thing. Thought I'd have to move them or something, but the dimensions are just right so that it doesn't interfere! The kit is nice too, comes with a syringe applicator for the thermal paste and all sorts of extra brackets and screws most people wouldn't need. Always nice to have extras in case you loose something hopelessly.     Also, beware, this heatsink has to mount on its own bracket that fits underneath the motherboard. This meant an entire rebuild as I had to remove the motherboard to fit the mounting bracket on. Essentially, installing is more complicated than simply lobbing your stock heatsink off and sticking this one on.
0743270754|5.0|Shrewd!  I would say that was a side of Lincoln I never knew about. (Also didn't-knows: how gregarious he was, how much he loved to joke and laugh and tell stories! he looks so serious on my $5 bills!  And how he considered Frederick Douglass a friend...I've also heard FD was critical of Lincoln, but was glad of him as the emancipating president.)<br /><br />This was an incredible examination of his cabinet; I loved the portion of the book that looked at their own upbringings and aspirations for the presidency. It was also satisfying to observe their initial dislike of Lincoln and their ultimate allegiance to him.<br /><br />Again, each member was shrewdly chosen by Lincoln, not for personal reasons, not because he owed someone a favor, but because he was the perfect man for the job. And considering the formidable 4 years he had ahead of him, it's a good thing he chose the people he did. They were each tailor-made for one of the most trying times in American history.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this, and hate to admit it, cried at the end. (Yes, I finished it just today, on the anniversary of his passing.) Though I think Lincoln himself would have felt that so many noble men had given their lives for their country in the Civil War, and he could very well afford to do the same...or something like that.  :)<br /><br />I read one review where the reviewer felt DKG had written more of a hagiography than a true political profile.  I wouldn't go that far but do agree she had very little--if anything--negative to say about Lincoln. I mean, that may be because there wasn't anything negative TO say. I don't know.<br /><br />There just aren't men like this one--or his cabinet--anymore. A true pleasure and delight to have read this.

B002XTBE6K|3.0|Many of us already know the story.  We are familiar with details, mannerisms, the wit and subtlety of Austen's work.  If I lay all that aside, this is not a bad movie.  I personally don't find Romola Garai at all engaging as an actress.  She portrays her characters in a \\"soap opera\\" style, far too overstated for my tastes.    So throwing my own, personal dislike for her aside, I can tolerate this movie.  But I won't be rewatching it anytime soon.  It is NOT Jane Austen's Emma, even in character.  I could forgive the dialogue if I could get over the mannerisms.  Emma is a 21 year old woman, not a 16 year old! And I agree with other reviews in that I think she waves too much, its distracting, especially where a delighted smile would have sufficed.    Unlike other reviewers I actually enjoyed the Jane Fairfax in this movie.  She was pathetic, but I didn't think it was so bad that it took away from the story.  It was interesting for me as an Austen fan to see that side of the story explored in that way.  It caused me to go back and read the story again and notice how they picked up on little details that are placed randomly throughout the story.     I think this movie is worth watching, the costumes are gorgeous, if a bit vibrant for the time, and the acting for some of the supporting characters is quite well done.  Just don't take it as Jane Austen's Emma.  If I had been prepared in that way I may have enjoyed it a bit more.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great game, and lots of fun!  The best part is that you will not get bored because the game board is never the same twice.  Be ready to come up with a new strategy every time you play!    Although the rules are not really that complicated, it does take time to teach new players.  Be prepared to spend a good 10-15 minutes before the start of any game involving first-time players.  If possible, try to play with at least one other person who has played before rather than teaching 2or 3 new people at once.  I taught just my mom first, and that made it so much easier to teach two new people the next time we played because the newbies could watch and observe our strategy.    Like I said, the rules are easy to understand once you start playing, but you will probably have a much better idea of the strategy involved after the first time you play.    I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys games that make you think.  This is not your standard rule the dice/flip the card and do what it says game.. the decisions of the players really impact the way the game turns out. They say ages 10 and up, but most of the 10 year olds I know would probably get bored (it takes at least an hour, ,usually more to complete, and might not be on a level-field with older players. I would recommend having younger players team up with an older player if you are playing with a mixed age group.    I cannot get enough of Catan, and that seems to be the way it goes for everyone I Introduce it to.  Get ready for tons of replay value!    PS If you want to change up the original, they offer various expansion packs that add new elements.  I havent tried any of them myself, but I look forward to trying them soon!

B0042100OY|5.0|This book helped my husband and I renew our marriage and realize things that we didn't know and how to rekindle the love in our relationship. We now understand each others perceptions in what we do for each other than means something and classified as love. WE know what is most important to us in communicating love to each other now. I strongly encourage every married couple or dating couple to read this book!
B004IFVBXS|2.0|Just an FYI about this VOD version of \\"Scream\\": it's not in the movie's original aspect ratio (2.35:1). To some, this might not matter a bit, but if I'm going to pay money for a VOD, I'd prefer it be the same aspect ratio as the DVD. And if it isn't, it should be labeled as such.<br /><br />(Two stars for the presentation. The movie itself? It's great.)
0545302862|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series and have recommended it to friends and they also love it too! these books are part of my home book collection.

B004I2K4E8|4.0|The O2 arena was a great venue for this concert. The last half hour or so, with all 3 casts together, was impressive! I don't understand why so many people have been over critical of Nick Jonas. As a 31 yo male I can easily say I am not in the Jonas Brothers demographic, nor have I listened to their music, by choice. I have two 6 yo daughters who do. I have to say that I was impressed with Nick Jonas performance. After watching his performance of Marius Pontmercy, I would say Nick should continue to pursue his career in broadway. People are quick to criticize his performance but after doing a quick google I found that this is not his first performance in a stage production. He has even performed in Les Miserables before as Gavroche in 2003.  It's refreshing to hear that someone who became a pop start has roots in stage and theater. I had my two 6 yo daughters watch this DVD and both were glued to the screen the entire time! The fact that Nick Jonas was in it helped a little I am sure.     This is an excellent show for the entire family. Get out and support local and national, theater! There is nothing better than live music and live theater!
1591796539|2.0|The Audio CD is \\"abridged\\". What a joke! It is only a bit over 3 hours of audio on 3 cd's. It appears the author talks about Chi Running rather than reading from the book.     If you have the ability to read and are interested in the book, buy the book instead.     Listening to this is like listening the the author give a speech about chi running or an informative podcast about Chi Running. It's interesting and informative, but it isn't listening to the book as written. In fact, I can't believe this counts as an audio \\"book\\".
0151013837|5.0|The only thing I have enjoyed more than re-reading this instant classic of a book is the re-teaching of it to my college literature classes.  It's a landmark of survival or trauma fiction, and of spiritual journeying. I expect that people will be reading it and being moved by it for many decades to come.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|Having come from a Nostromo N52 I had high hopes for the Logitech G13. I am a fairly avid gamer, playing Wow several times a week. I was really looking forward to the added functionality of having the extra buttons on the G13. Unfortunately, after using the unit for just a few days, I ended up sending it back.     Here's why:    1) Poor Ergonomics. The joystick can not be used the same as the thumbpad on the N52. It is set too far back to be used comfortably all of the time. Also, the Joystick is too sensitive. Sometimes when I move the bar up, it would trigger as if I pushed it to the side and vice versa. My real issue though is that the unit just isn't as comfortable as the N52. Not even close. 45 minutes of gaming, and my hand was cramping.     2) More buttons did not equal, well....more abilities. The extra buttons are not easily reachable....at all. Honestly, I found all but two of them unusable because I could not reach them easily. I shouldn't have to be a contortionist to use all of the buttons on a game controller. Add the fact that it is missing the scroll wheel from the N52, and I found that I really didn't have any more buttons.    Build quality is stellar. It really is built FAR nicer than any game controller from Belkin. Nice and heavy, good tactile feel on keys and buttons. Backlit keys change color based on shift state. The software that comes with this is incredible, giving you the option of what you want to view on your game controller display including Battleground Stats (Wow), CPU stats, Date & Time, etc. The software for the Mac side worked great as well, and lost no functionality compared to the Windows software.    I really wanted to like this product. I got sick of Belkin's non-existent Mac support for the N52, and thought this was the answer. Sadly, due to it's poor ergonomic design, it wasn't.     I guess I'm now looking at an upgrade to the N52-TE.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|Wow. This movie was based on a book written by the man this actually happened to. Long story short...the man falls down a hole in the ground, gets his hand stuck in between a Rock and a Hard Place (the name of the book), evaluates his life and finds out that the bad choices he made led him to be there, and eventually cuts his hand off to get out of the situation.<br /><br />You really have to admit...this man, Mr. Aron Ralston, really wanted to live. The movie is 5/5, but even if it was 1/5 I would still be impressed by the desire of this man to keep going. Not everyone can cut their own hand off with a dull blade to survive. [...] it takes guts.<br /><br />5/5<br />John McAdam:<br />Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?<br />Am I Mad or Coherent?
0806930152|2.0|I have been drawing for going on 50 years; Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life is one of those books that was always around when I was growing up and learning to draw. I turned to this work (and many others) for reference often when I was young. Recently I purchased a new copy of this book from Amazon.com just to have in my collection of drawing resource material (and, I suppose, for a bit of nostalgia). The reproductions of Bridgman's demonstrative drawings in these newer editions are surprisingly poor I think, sometimes washed out and faded, all too often very muddled or blotchy... the same effect one would see if you used a low quality copy machine to make a copy of a copy of a copy of a pencil sketch... the publishers are obviously keeping in print a long established favorite that they know will sell and are not overly concerned with putting out a quality product. So, look for a vintage edition if you must have this book... I could not see using these current editions as a quality learning or teaching tool.<br />From a more subjective point of view, Bridgman has never quite impressed me for learning life/figure drawing... personally I just never quite warmed up to his style. The text is appropraite to the illustrations in terms of the mechanics of the body and naming the parts that do the work, but there is little to nothing by way of drawing theory/technique, elements of what makes a successful drawing work... Bridgeman rightfully focuses in breaking down the human body as simplified shapes... although in Bridgman's drawings simplified shapes appear rather grotesque distortions. On pages 212/213 where he describes how to draw an armpit... well, I'm looking at it right now and... well... frankly it's a mess. If you want to learn to draw the various parts of the human form as architectural moulding, block and tackle, wedges and fulcrum, etc., this is the book for you. If you want to learn how to make a realistic anatomically correct figure drawing jumpoff the page through line quality, contour, compostion, perspective, light and shadow, subtlety, etc., seek elsewhere.<br />The extremely brief breakdown of facial expression is sad (pun intended).<br />There is a nice section on 'draping', how cloth folds, hangs, bunches and masses, but the reproduced images are poor to the point of being near useless in these editions.<br />The question of learning/knowing human anatomy so that one may render it believably in a artistic sense is best covered, I believe, elsewhere. But depending on your artistic goals, level of experience, interest and commitment, this might be a good book for you; just make sure you get an edition where you can actually make out what the good Mr. Bridgman is trying to show you.
1439102724|5.0|Another winner for Jodi Picoult, but one warning: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE INCLUDED CD! The singer is absolutely horrid and I almost didn't read the book after listening to the CD. Luckily, I was able to put the affront to music aside and thoroughly enjoy the novel.

I loved this movie and am sad to see the franchise end, I am disappointed that there were no special features that most of the other Saws had.    Now that it is over I want to buy the entire set but for now I am going to hols off and wait in the  hope they come out with a Bluray special edition 3-D version.    This is a must see, but if you haven't seen the other Saws start with one and work your way through, if you have seen the others then this closes out the series and ties up loose ends.

B000HEWEE4|1.0|Personally I like a bit of mystery in a movie. So I don't really care about the how and why of the 2 year time warp.<br />I think it could have been a great movie if the acting wasn't so terrible. Good movies get under your skin, they draw you in. You feel the laughter and pain of the persons that are portrayed. Good movies can take your breath away from sheer laughter, and can move you to tears, often by simple gestures and \\"under\\"acting instead of over-acting. I mean I saw Reeves breaking down and crying after his father died and I wasn't moved at all. It was superficial, artificial and 1-dimensional. I would have liked this nice story to be played well. The story certainly deserves a remake with better acting. This movie is certainly not for keeps. Don't even spend your money to rent it.

B004HO6I4M|3.0|Rio is getting tie-ins everywhere, fast food, video games and it's all over the most popular social networks. This can only mean one thing: Rio needs a big backhomer* warning! And after the recent, wonderful for adults, Rango, and the wonderful for adults and kids, Despicable Me, and the wonderful for kids, Hop, Rio has its work cut out to be THE Easter blockbuster.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for everything Rio does well it gets a dozen things wrong; it doesn't even flow, let alone fly.<br /><br />5 stars for Jermaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as nasty Nigel and for his song, it's the undoubted highlight of Rio.<br /><br />4 stars for the rest of the music, there is something Jungle Book-esque about the way music permeates Rio, and 4 stars for the sumptuous, sunny visuals but that is almost to be expected from animations these days. In many cases the animation is the gloss over the cracks of the rest of the movie and just because there's lots of colour and movement, it doesn't necessarily mean that anything good is happening.<br /><br />3 stars for 3-D which again is proving not to be the future of entertainment but just another cash grab. The vibrancy and vividness of Rio make for some wonderful effects but the point is you don't MISS the 3-D when viewing in 2-D.<br /><br />2 stars for story, young kids will love it but most over 8s will have seen similar a dozen or so times already in their lives. Rio doesn't exactly copy and paste from other movies (Madagascar excepted) but the plot is as formulaic as it's possible to be.<br /><br />And 1 star, ultimately, for just being a very lazy and clich&eacute;d movie. There's little to actually recommend here, nothing is particularly defined. The bad guys aren't especially so, apart from Nigel. The stooges and support are direct from some kind of off-the-peg central casting for comedic support. The Rio backdrop is vivid and delightful but there is no sense of this actually being Brazil. The story is a mish-mash with no real threat or terror involved. And the movie as a whole is all rather thrown together: lots of scenes and lots of imagination, vital ingredients, but the resultant concotion is more collapsed souffl&eacute; than magnificent meringue.<br /><br />Finally, i really should dock a star for the way Nigel met his end. Completely out of character with the rest of the film and not a fitting end for such a memorable villain.<br /><br />So, fantastic and vibrant visuals, formualic and flat story. 3 stars: Well average!<br /><br />*Backhomer - i.e You get back home and wish you'd stayed there in the first place.

B0036TGSIK|3.0|The witty dialogue in Easy A is it's most redeeming quality, but I'm afraid it ends there. The story's Antagonist a judgmental Christian set on destroying people with her Puritanical values; that is a stereotypical cliche that just won't die, thanks in part to movies like this.    If you can look past the subtle bigotry of it's message, it's not a bad movie. That is, if you're already inclined to overlook bigotries, and you happen to share them.
B0041LG08U|5.0|I received the watch today and I am very impressed.  I believe that the current picture shown doesn't give it justice.  Be sure to search the web for other pictures to get a true idea of what to expect.  The watch arrived well packaged with the original gift box, instructions and warranty.  For an automatic watch under $150 it is a steal!   The seller that I received the watch from was Time Outlet.  I was very satisfied with their service and will have no problem buying from them again.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Willow > LotR. Let me count the ways. This is not sensationalism, btw.    1. Casting. Willow offers a vibrant cast, believably servicing their roles with a blend of seriousness and humour. Casting is an art form, and some of that LotR CG budget would've been better spent lavishing wealth onto a deserving & skilled casting director.    2. Effects & Costumery. Gollum is the antithesis of what CG in a fantasy world should be. Any movie-magic hack could've made a better Gollum in a dirty suburban garage. A foolish waste of budget, and again disserviced by poor voice casting.  3. Script. Yes, even a world-famous fantasy novel can be stripped of it's charm, intent, mood, edginess, integrity, & ultimately: value.  4. Fun & Wonder. OK, OK, it's a vast buttressed storyline driven into the collective consciousness, and it deserves 3 films, but the charm is strained early and buried by hour 3. Willow evokes a world, inhabits it with wonder, and delivers time and again, without repulsive lulls and moronic dialogue.  6. \\"Believability.\\" With all the iffy CG & foolishness, the LotR world doesn't coyly reveal it's charms, & there is no subtlety.    7. Revisitation. LotR hasn't even an ounce. Maybe if 75% was cut, it could've been an spoiled epic for the 2025 bargain bin.    This is all to say: Willow delivers on every promise that a fantasy film intrinsically makes to it's viewer. Throwing millions at a great story does not a great film make. Tremendous interest, varied pressures, outsourcing, etc. is no excuse. I hope that I'm still alive when a new company makes a new (gritty) version of LotR. As a family fantasy epic, Willow trounces LotR. A modern cinematic LotR should never have been aimed at families. It should've been rated R, for extreme scenes of violence, sexual situations, drug use, distressing psychological themes, subversive messages, etc. Middle-Earth is a treacherous world, and Frodo is a broken anti-hero murderer struggling with addiction. Compare that image to thewhining brat Frodo who bumbles through the films. What a shame.       But yes I know... $$$$$. In that case, Willow is everything that a family-style LotR should've been: an expertly-cast, well-written, imaginative frolic that withstands revisiting.

The unique storytelling style of this book was really refreshing.

It was in my opinion, the most interesting out of the whole series. The plot, characters, and NYC setting also made it worth reading. It was full of action, battles, journeys, adventure and had a great ending even though deaths were in the story. I finished the 381 page book in 4 days. That's how much I was into it. Rick Riordan is a very good author.

Great that Amazon has a LaCie Orange Cable that does what I needed and has a great return policy.
B0041KKYD8|3.0|First off, I'm not going to comment on whether this movie should or shouldn't have been made, or whether it was inappropriate, blah blah blah.  If you want to go that route, then you better have the same opinion of Deliverance.  If you don't like the idea of it, DO NOT WATCH IT!  It was soooo disturbingly graphic in the rape scene that I almost threw up.  Unfortunately, it is hard to shock people these days, but this will definitely shock the average person.  All controversies aside, this movie was a B grade horror movie with a taste of Deliverance mixed into the Saw movies.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and the revenge is almost as foul as the actions that set off the main character.  Do I think this is realistic, no.  This is a typical B to C grade thriller with a lot of controversy surrounding it.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|CD arrived quickly and in perfect order.  LOVE The Music LOVE the movie.  Highly recommend CD and the Seller  ENjoy
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I typically don't write reviews, but given the deplorable state of popular music these days I think this album deserved a shout-out. I've been a fan of the group since the 1st album, played many many songs live in cover bands across their career too and always enjoyed their tunes. This album is the strongest, most complete album start to finish they've released in years, the 1st half is particulary great. If you're even just a casual fan, I'd recommend a buy on this for sure. (FWIW - I picked up the new Radiohead recently too and though that's an entirely different group from FF, RH should be ashamed of that album compared to a release like Wasting Light...and I like RH!)
B002ZDOXLW|5.0|This is a wonderful album and being a fan of Loreena I must say it is one of my favorites. I enjoy the liner notes telling you the stories behind the music. It is exotic, traditional, majestic, and beautiful all wrapped into one album.
B004NSULHM|1.0|Big fan of the band, have a multitude of their albums in rotation at all times. I actually tend to dig a lot of their electronica-laced work throughout. But this album...I can't even think of a proper analogy. It's kind of like a talented cake maker puts a new one in the oven...but somehow in a profound bout of bewilderment opens the oven early to check, sees the cake collapse, and removes it imeediately and says \\"well that's as good as it gets\\".     Against his better judgment, the artisan puts this cake out front for sale to anyone dumb enough to buy some half-baked hot mess. His devoted fans rush in to check out his new creation. Many of them enthusiastically sample a slice of cake and immediately can tell this new cake is not worthy of even a novice effort. Rather than confess to themselves or one another that this is utter crap, they decide the only logical conclusion is this cake must transcend the former definition of mastery. So they begin extolling the virtues of this exalted progression and deem that this new cake will be wasted on the less cultivated that cannot appreciate this evolution in baking.      So the cake maker produces many more, packages them in used tissue paper, and keeps pushing them out front. One day an out-of-towner walks in and asks, \\"Hey what's this big hot mess? Some new experiment that didn't work out?\\" The cake maker shrugs indifferently, and as orders for more of the 'hot mess' keep coming in, he's content pushing more out the door because he has forgotten his former glory.     Little By Little and Codex are two slices that turned out OK, the rest is rubbish...  A good band is a terrible thing to waste.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|Her latest effort sounds completely new and outstretched from her previous releases, don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean the album sucked, in fact, it is completely the opposite, `Goodbye Lullaby' totally rocks. To sum things up in a few, Avril sounds vocally stronger than ever, the lyrics are more in depth, the music is hot and I'm completely taken in by her new sound.
B0001US62I|4.0|I think the movie a psychological thriller which is a reaction to the idea of the modern society as \\"good.\\"  The movie seems to hint at a deeper level of consciousness in which the average person see's good as bad and vice versa.  The \\"good\\" man is a moralistic individual trying to forget his evil past.  In the end, it is the moral individual who goes to hell.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Anyone who enjoys laughing should buy this. I laughed out loud VERY often. I don't know how my fellow commuters felt about this, but I enjoyed it very much. Tina Fey's descriptions are not only hilarious, but they hit the nail on the head. And she is awesome.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I love the page flip effect! I bought it before it was offered for free and I use it all the time. It works well on my rooted nook color for reading my pdf formatted mangas.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I use this tool all the time for diagnosing wifi issues, as well as determining ideal placement of my router. Must have.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker has everything you want in a GREAT STORY,mean enemies and SEXY WOMEN and great costumes and scenery.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|Everything about this movie is well handled. Smooth animation, nice storyline even though some things naturally had to be changed here and there. Even though everyone Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill would have made this perfect, I still liked the voice for the Joker they chose, as it made his character a bit darker this time around.    No spoilers of course, but the end of this movie still chokes me up a little every time I watch it. Really, it's a slash fan's paradise. Yaoi anyone? I'm just saying...
B00004U8P9|5.0|For some reason I got the soundtrack to this iconic, cult classic stuck in my head the other day. That's when I realized the tragedy that I didn't have this in my DVD collection. I had to fix that immediately! This movie makes me feel young, as when the world was new, to quote another favorite movie. Seriously though, it brought me right back to midnight movies in high school and college. It brought back those interactive nights throwing toast and squirting water guns in a theater. And it brought back my brother getting his first hint that his baby brother was gay. Ah, good times! If you haven't ever seen RHPS, or if your only exposure to it is one episode of Glee, do not buy this DVD yet. Find a midnight showing of this movie somewhere near you, preferably near a large university, and GO. This movie must be seen in a theater late at night with people in costume in order to be truly appreciated. And you actually need to go several times before you can get the full effect. This DVD reproduces this theater experience to some extent, but you'll never truly 'get it' until you walk out of a theater at nearly 2 in the morning with rice in your hair next to a guy in a corset and heels.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app makes purchasing through amazon a breeze. You can order / track shipments with just a few clicks.   I have used the app several times saving both time and money!
B002ZG983M|5.0|This was a great movie. Right now super hero movies are hot, but this one breaks the mold. There's no Superman or Spiderman in this movie. This is based on the premise that normal, everyday people can be 'super' too. It's a fun movie filled with action and a surprising moment or two of drama. Nothing too heavy, don't worry. The lead character really grows into his hero-ness with the help of friends, enemies, and a child assassin named Hit Girl. Yeah, it's a bit formulaic, but it works. If you like super heroes and are in the mood for an action/comedy, this is definitely the movie for you.
0316069353|5.0|Comparing reviewer's comments of Michael Connelly's The Fifth Witness, I was shocked to see \\"1\\" ratings.  As I looked further, I realized that the reviewers complaints were the cost to read on Kindle.  I would give this book over 5 if possible.  The author gave us a very good look into the strategy of both the defense and prosecution in the way they presented their witnesses and the questioning in this case.  Mickey Haller is back in action with his Lincoln and his associates.  If readers find the cost on Kindle prohibitive, go to your public library  and borrow it from there.  But don't compare \\"apples with oranges\\".  A Michael Connnelly fan!!
B003VS0CWO|3.0|Some things just were not meant to be watched on Blu Ray on a 46\\" 1080p LED TV with 120MHz refresh... and this is certainly one of them.    I've seen RHPS in theaters (and been the projectionist you all yell at) and on DVD and the Blu Ray was a completely different experience. For some films bright vivid colors and images work wonders, and restorations like from the Criterion Collection never cease to amaze... but some things should be left the way they are. Dirty, stained, dark and all together wonderful... things like Rocky Horror.    I'm just glad I kept my DVD copy when the Bluray came.
1936041111|5.0|Frankenstein is one of the key templates of modern fiction, setting into motion narratives regarding anxiety about science and creation, power over nature, and more saliently anxiety over reproduction, particularly male anxiety. The novel revolves around an implicit and typical family romance that can be found in many gothic novels - the temptation or possibility of incestuous relationship and its sublimation and avoidance.  There is also a fairly radical revolutionary subtext in the novel inspired in part by Mary Shelley's father William Godwin (his own fictional works are mirror images of Frankenstein in many ways).
B001SRC9P8|5.0|I am currently reading the 8th book, Wanted. Im obsessed with these books, they are sooooooo good, but def start from the begining, and also, the are mostly for teens.
B000L43AN4|5.0|Not only excelent conditions of packing, and a great album design. It's a really good album. It sounds great, and are really good songs.  Better than what i was expected.
B004529NKM|4.0|I really enjoyed this dvd alot, im used to the urban music and dancing anyway,, so this was right up my alley.
0920668372|3.0|This is one of my children's favorite books.  So I purchased it for my brand new great nephew and I was a  little dissapointed that it was small and the shipping was more than the cost of the book.  Still a great read for children.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Amazing American literature. It does get slow in the middle, but this is one of the best written books ever.  It is just written so beautifully that it is hard to read a book after it.  I feel like the character became a part of me!
0316069353|5.0|This review is about the book, not about the pricing.   Frankly, I think it is an abuse of the system of write a review about the pricing in this space.  This is an excellent legal thriller.  I love this character that Connelly has created and how well the story fits into the larger story arc without being totally dependent upon the reader having read the other books.  I hated to put this one down.   I read too late at night and I was late to work because I picked it up again in the morning.  Connelly fans will not be disappointed with this one!  Thank you Michael Connelly and please keep them coming!!!
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I'm done, done, done(!) buying Michael Connely's e-books. I've bought seven on my iPad so far and finally said enough. The pricing is absolutely out of whack and this is the only meaningful forum to make it known.  As for the book, it's pretty good as far as Michael Connelly books go and Mickey Haller makes for a more intriguing character than the Harry Bosch-led series. In any event, I'd rather go to the library or throw my business to a local bookseller.  Little, Brown and Company are free to charge exorbitant prices for their products and their authors are free to acquiesce. We the readers are also free to make our opinions known and spend our money accordingly.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|I wasn't too sure about this when I saw the trailer but the movie was fun to watch and the extras on the DVD were really cool.  They did a great job filming real trains and setting it in a believable scenario.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Rio Edition is very nice and love it, now on my free time i'm busy and this game makes time goes by fast, get it , you wont regreat it! It's awesome and looks good on Vibrant! Works great, graphics are cool and inexpensive wich makes it a game of my choice!
B004O86JZ4|5.0|It's been a LONG time since I've listened to a new album more than once in a sitting. \\"Wasting Light\\" has only been out 2 days and I've listened to it at least 10 times. It takes an incredible album like this one.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Still...  Definitively...  The Foo Fighters are legends!    This band has taken me from a hip-hop fan to a rock fan and beyond that.  They have opened me up to a new level and a new music experience!  Wasting light may not be the best Foo Fighters album(certainly not my favorite, One by One), but it is definitely a great one.  I feel as though this is the Foo Fighters that I fell in love with.  That this is the Foo Fighters, the garage band, the grunge band that everyone loves, the screams, the guitar rifts, the everything that I loved!  This is a return to Foo Fighters roots and it is wonderful!    Each track is technically appealing in that they each offer a higher level of complexity.  It is not boring to listen to, and it keeps you guessing.  My first listen through the album I was blown away with some of the new sounds.  Favorite tracks right now at least are:  1,2,5,7,9,10.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This is a film that \\"captures you\\".  I have watched it over and over, and each time more layers are uncovered.  It has prompted me to gain information . . . about the historical context and each of the characters.  I knew about Dali, being an artist, but I knew nothing of Lorca and Bunuel.  This is a lovely film, portraying the times with style and taste.  The actors are perfect as the characters they are creating.  The romance . . . well, is what the story is all about.  I give this movie as many stars as possible and may purchase a second copy just in case my first one breaks!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like that this has an amazing selection of downloads, but aldiko is much more feature rich. Although I prefer aldiko, though, I appreciate how much easier this is to navigate and download books.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|This was one of the most boring movies I watched.   No action at all.  A couple violent deaths .  Not recommended at all.[[ASIN:B0034G4OXQ Hereafter]][[ASIN:B0034G4OY0 Hereafter (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]][[ASIN:B004IWR06S Hereafter [Blu-ray]]]
B0047Y17P2|3.0|I have to say I'm a little disappointed. I have been waiting for the release of this book since February when Amazon put it on the list. I don't know why Amazon will not let you pre-order a sample like they do with pre-ordering the purchase when it's released. I don't feel this book is up to the quality of something like Lincoln Lawyer, which I thought was really good. I also loved the Harry Bosch series. I've read them all, some of them twice.    I also don't understand the vehemence with which the reviewers complain about the price. I too would prefer the $ 9.99 price, but when I factor in everything, like the trip to the bookstore, factoring in both the time involved and the cost of the trip, or the lack of a free sample at the bookstore (I know you can stand there and read parts, but I don't have that kind of time) and even then books can drop out after a good beginning. I can't see trekking to the bookstore to return something, again with time and money wasted . I don't want to have to worry about keeping the book pristine in case I want to return it. Same for a real book ordered from Amazon. If I want to return it I have to deal with UPS and that's real pain and, of course, there's the shipping cost both ways. I also value the great convenience of downloading a book in the middle of the night. Then there's the Amazon policy of no questions return after 7 days if you don't like the book. To me, that's invaluable and I  only return less than 10% of the books I buy. And, finally, there's the continuing cost of building bookcases because I can't bear to throw books out and there is no easy way to get rid of them in a way that is useful to someone else. I've tried nursing homes, hospitals, libraries, used book stores and none of them have been worth the time and energy to donate them to. I haven't tried jails, but I think that's out. They are also heavy to move in any quantity.    All told, I think the price is worth what you get. Again, I would prefer the $ 9.99 price, but you know how it is, they will charge what the traffic will bear. It will reach a tipping point eventually and then the publisher will have to retreat when their business falls off because of the price. That's how the system works.
0792839749|5.0|The Video, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was ordered for my Grandaughter.  She loves the video and has watched it so many times she can repeat the songs and most of the spoken words by memory!  I appreciate Amazon for giving us good, clean videos for children!  I will continue to order such products as will many of my church members.  Pastorole
B00127RAJY|5.0|From a perspective of: Getting a great workout in 20 min and making you sweat, this video will do just that. The moves aren't fancy, easy to follow and will get the heart rate pumping! Level 2 in my opinion is harder than level 3. The main complaint people have with workout videos is not getting board, and the motivation to do it. This video goes super fast, and you will get a great workout in 20 min. The complaints I have is that it has 3 levels, each 20 min, so if you are more advanced like me, I only get 40 min worth of exercise out of a 60 min video. Also the moves are hard on your joints. I personally like Angie Gorr's 50/50 cardio weights where she shows 3 levels all at the same time, so you get 70 min of pure level 3 if you want, or can mix and match between lower and higher levels during the exercise. I am also a fan of Jari love and Jackie Warner, which are in my favorites along with this video. Both Jackie and Jari focus on more high-repetitions. The 30 day shred video is more of a circuit, and doesn't completely fatigue the muscles like Angie,Jackie and Jari; however, it does keep the heart rate up while doing weights.  Jillian's style takes some getting used to, but the more you do the video the more she grows on you. This is definitely a video that you will use over and over again, but you shouldn't do it 30 days in a row. You want to give your muscles a rest, so if you are sore, then switch to a cardio video for a day, and then go back to this a day later. I've done over 50 workout videos, and this one is one of my favorites, but if you have injuries, just be careful and listen to your body and modify the exercise if you start to feel pain.    Update! I am updating my review to 5 stars, because it is really one of my favorite videos. I find that if I want a 60 min workout, I do level 2, then level 3 and then level 2 again. You REALLY do get a great workout. I think I just needed to get used to it, but after doing more videos, I find that this is one Ican always come back to and get a great sweat!
B004G5VFOU|5.0|The deluxe edition of this classic album is phenomanal. The remastering is superb. the live and alternate take bonus tracks are high sound quality and not just throw away tracks like some are. If you loved this album like I do you owe it to yourself to spend the extra bucks and pick this one up.
B004IM14RY|4.0|Ryan Reynolds proved himself to be a great actor in this film. Very believable and he held it down on his own which even the more shows his talent, but I truly was hoping for a better ending. The end was weak, but it was a decent movie up until that point. Great thriller/suspense movie
158270208X|3.0|The concept behind the journal is great....but if you have read or listened to The Secret, you could create your own journal with your own notebook or bound journal.  The size is a bit small for me and my writing.  The goldleafing that decorates the outside is poor quality and varies from book to book (I bought more than one for gifts).  Not worth the price in my opinion.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Though it took me a few episodes to understand the characters and the rhythm of the show, once I understood what was going on I feel in love.     Unlike other shows, Community never sacrifices their characters for the story. No matter how crazy the situation, these characters remain true to themselves. The honest portrayal allows the viewer to believe and invest in the most ridiculous of circumstances and never lose respect for the show.    Furthermore, this is a true DVD for the fans. Dan Harmon-creator, three to four cast members and a crew member have commentary on EVERY SINGLE episode. The fact that they took time to sit down and record the behind the scenes  style commentary speaks volumes to me.     Plus, there are bloopers on every disc. You don't have to wait to watch the bloopers after viewing all 25 episodes. Every six episodes or so, there is another 7 minute bloopers reel, each one funnier than the last.    Overall, this show is amazing and only continues to get better in season 2.    Do yourself a favor, and buy your copy and start watching the show today. You will not regret it.
B000E41MS6|5.0|The interduction to this Doctor Who series as BBC brings back our favorite doctor is awesome. I love how this doctor acts with Rose, and we learn about him. For newer people getting into Doctor Who this will help. No we won't get to know his past adventers that he's had, but it gives you insight to know how this one reacts. Being the 9th Doctor Christopher Eccleston is awesome. I do enjoy the characteristics he brought into being the doctor. It brings his own flare to it and his interaction with Rose is sweet. Jack Harkness is awesome coming in, we see him as a con-man adding a flare to the Doctor and Rose's relationship.
0062020897|5.0|This was just what I wanted. A fast, easy to follow, suspenseful book that takes place in a tremendous setting. I really felt attached to the characters and the end when Faber is on the island is just awesome. I LOVED THIS BOOK.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This is a great story if you are into the idea of political Intrigue of the medieval times.  The back and forth between warring families and the way they send off they're own children like party favors to cement a new political alliance is extremely interesting as well as well written.  There are so many main characters you first feel overwhelmed but the books are written well enough that you never seem to have any trouble keeping up with them.  My only grievance with this set is the fact that I bought the books singly for the Kindle and now the four book set is more expensive by about 10 dollars since the books are being translated into an HBO series.  I think this would be a wonderful set to incorporate into a series but I'd be damned if I'd buy this set for Kindle when the paperbacks can very readily be found for a fraction of the electronic price!
0802473156|5.0|My fiance told me about this book and after reading it, i realised that i still have a lot to work on on our relationship and the secret to a healthy relationship is in this 5 love language.I recommend this for all who is plannin on going to the altar or in a relationship.
B00129Q1V0|5.0|\\"Q\\" and G.B. put their collective feet in this soulful stew. I bought this on cassette back in January 1980 just prior to driving cross country from Norfolk, VA to San Diego, CA. This joint was in constant rotation. The songs are all so different in mood and tempo that it plays more like a complilation than a stand-alone project. \\"Moody's Mood\\" stands out as my favorite side here. This is the only R&B/Pop flavored LP of Benson's that I own, since I'm more a fan of his jazz offerings, i.e. \\"Good King Bad,\\" \\"White Rabbit,\\" etc. However, this is a treasure that will always be close at hand.
B000HCPU0Q|5.0|Having waited years for this release when it finally arrived it was like all my Christmas coming together as this singles box set has it all.     Including all the singles even 1985s This is England this is definitely a release any hardcore Clash fan will want to have. The real pleasure begins when you open the box and see all the singles are presented in their original covers and even the discs are made to like the old singles and for one split second i thought i had picked up the wrong format. That worry was soon forgotten when i realised what they had done.     The thing with the Clash was they were actually a real singles band in that they just didn't release recycled album tracks they actually had stand alone singles. Such as Radio clash, Complete Control and the brilliant (white Man) in hammersmith Palais, you also get the Cost of Living ep. As you would expect the artwork for their singles was always top notch.     So what you get is 19 singles all presented in their original case, some of the singles include newly added tracks, such as the ones that were released in America, So you end up getting tracks that have never been released on cd before. As some singles had different mixes for different countries. Some of the singles have over seven songs on them. This release is surley meant to be loaded on to your mp3/ipod for full enjoyment.     Included is a booklet which features contributors like Shane McGowan, Ian Brown, Mike D (Beastie Boys), and ex footballer (yes some do have good taste) Stuart Pearce. Even their former manager Bernie Rhodes writes a few words.     Casual Clash fans would probably be better of with the single disc release but for Clash fanatics this is really ESSENTIAL.
B004NSULHM|3.0|I love Radiohead, they're one of my favorites. This latest feels a bit uninspired, like a sequel to Amnesiac.  It's respectable, it's familiar, but it's somewhat bland.  There's no sense of them tackling something or some place they've not been before.  Perhaps that's just a consequence of a band that has historically been willing to reimagine their sound.  I'm ready for them to pick up their instruments again and put them to use.  Enough with the electronica, please.  If you're a fan, though, pick it up.  It's still a pleasurable music experience.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This was a great movie! The music was fantastic the acting was out of this world. It was so good I had to own the movie so when it came out on DVD I was there! Great job Christine and Cher!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Foo Fighters have never released any subpar album.  From the thin sounding debut to the fleshed out follow up, Colour and the Shape, the Foos have proven consistency ever since.  What makes Wasting Light stand apart from the others is focus.  From There is \\"Nothing Left to Lose\\" through \\"Echoes, Silence\\".. (which I also thought was a superb album) the band had a bit of meandering approach in which each song had a bit of a different style.  Not so here.  It's rocked out.  The song structures are solid.  From start to finish it flows smoothely.  My only gripe, albeit a small one, is the song White Limo.  Dave screams in an unintelligble voice box, making it an unnecessarily abrasive track.    Outstanding tracks are Arlandria, Miss the Misery, and I should've known.    The album cover, also, is really cool.  I'm not one to place a lot of stock in album artwork.  But the cover really gives the impression of a classic album.  The dynamite songs help solidify the emergence of a true landmark album for Foo Fighters.
0316113506|4.0|I listened to the audio version on the book. It's an enjoyable read and I was engrossed in the message. The main message is simply this: The more fit among us have more energy and do better at our daily tasks. This was proved in Naperville, IL where the students at Madison Junior High School were studied while given new ways to get in shape and stay in shape through physical fitness.<br /><br />Where I argue with the message is that it pushes aerobic exercise and doesn't mention the all-important resistance exercise. In fact, studies are proving that resistance exercise is more important and is, in and of itself, a cardiovascular workout. I'm so tired of people, especially fitness authors and others, who always think \\"aerobics\\".<br /><br />Aerobics was invented in the sixties to get women moving. Women wouldn't do weight training. So something that appealed to them was brought about. Then men started doing it and we know the rest. And now there are bad knees, hip replacements and worn out bodies. The human body was not meant to run for long periods. It was, however, designed to lift heavy items in spurts and to be prepared to, if necessary, run for a short distance quickly. Zebra run for miles in a herd. People do not. The only time you see a herd of people running like zebras is in a marathon, after which at least one person often falls dead. The person. Not the zebra.<br /><br />Aerobics make money for gyms and for others. It gets people, especially women, into the gym several times a week and the money comes in. It sells DVDs and various programs. Resistance exercise doesn't do that --- especially the scientifically-proven most effective form of one intense, brief session per week.<br /><br />But that aside, I like the way the author shows how exercise improved brain function.<br /><br />All of us who workout know how wonderful exercise makes us feel. If I'm depressed, a short workout will make me feel renewed. If something is hurting or I just don't feel good, some exercise turns that around and I feel great, relaxed and ready to go.<br /><br />But it also makes our brain function better, at a higher level. Studies show it can ward off Alzheimer's. We don't hear much about that because it's not making money for big pharma and the medical establishment.<br /><br />If you want to know just what exercise can do for your mind and the way you function, you'll want to listen to this audio or read the book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />-- Susanna K. Hutchesonl great, relaxed and ready to go.    But it also makes our brain function better, at a higher level. Studies show it can ward off Alzheimer's.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|After watching this once, yep I watched it again. And will watch it again this afternoon.  Wow! Washington is great as always, Chris Pine a natural with his seasoned veteran partner.  Don't miss this one. I'm buying it for my son's birthday (44) tomorrow. Enjoy
B0000844I8|5.0|If you liked him in Pretty In Pink &/or Wolf, you'll get a kick out of James Spader in Stargate. He is the complete opposite of those two prior roles & in fact falls under the category \\"dweeb.\\" He wears glasses, is obsessed with Egyptian history, & has a really bad case of allergies when he travels. The only person who made the movie even better is Kurt Russell, the man who can do a lot with a little. Mili Avital was stunning as Sha'uri & Alexis Cruz was wonderful as Skaara. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves science fiction with a bit of humor.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter.  She listens to it every day.  If you liked the movie, you will love this CD.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|WELL THE FOO FIGHTERS NEW CD HAS A GREAT SOUND AND FEEL. RECORDING ON ALL ANALOG EQUIPMENT REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE PLUS THE DIRECTION THE BAND TOOK TO ADD NEW SOUND TO WHAT HAS BECOME A ROUTINE SOUND I FEEL WILL CARRY THEM FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE. THEY ARE AS REVELENT NOW IF NOT MORE THEN WHEN THEY STARTED A++
0439023513|5.0|SPOILER-SPOILER-SPOILER-SPOILER  I was worried about reading both Catching Fire and Mockingjay after I pulled out of the fog that I descended into while reading - well, maybe devouring - The Hunger Games.  I was completely absorbed by the book, but when I emerged I felt emotionally jerked around, and very concerned that when Hollywood got a hold of it, the movie audience would essentially be like the Capital audience, slurping up horrors for entertainment.  I had decided to read the series based on recommendations and on the author's premise of depicting how terrible war is for children.  But, really, how could I not find out what happened?  I am soooo glad I did!  Suzanne Collins gets us right there on the edge of our seats, and then she shows, us, really shows us, the absolute horrors of war.  The twisting of good, loyal people like Gale into terrorists, the use of the innocent as pawns (Prim, the capitol children), the use of a girl and boy (Katniss and Peeta), who each in their own way manage to be both survivors (who have to lie and kill to do so) and people who maintain a moral compass, by anyone and everyone for their own ends. The way power players manage to stay at the top (Plutarch Heavensbee)despite destruction all around, some at their own hands. That surviving is very different from winning, or succeeding, because you never recover from that sort of devastation.  And I love that Katniss, even in her almost entirely controlled state of being drugged and traumatized by Coin at the end, manages to at least use that one arrow, that only tiny peice of power she has left, to take out Coin. What a releif!  Thank you Suzanne Collins!  I pray that you will have enough control over the films to keep the movies true to the spirit of criticizing war as a solution for anyone besides those orchestrating it.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|I'm not going to get into the \\"classic\\" Foo VS \\"modern\\" Foo debate.  This IS archetypal Foo Fighter rock, and it rocks!  It is HIGHLY accessible (= marketable), but it is not watered down.  \\"White Limo,\\" \\"Dear Rosemary,\\" \\"Matter of Time,\\" \\"Alandria,\\"... OK... I'm going to list every track, because there is not a bad track on this album.  Buy it.  Don't even think about it.  Just buy this one.
141690977X|3.0|I thought the book was crap, but the service was excellent and the book arrived very quickly.  I suppose the book would be OK for young women just starting out in the dating scene, but for a 'mature' woman like me, it was just a rehash of stuff I already knew. Most of the losers he described were just abusers and users and a woman with self-esteem would avoid them.  A book on self-esteem would be of more use, I think.
B004WPIJ4I|5.0|The song is brilliant. RedOne and Gaga really played to Gaga's strengths. It's reminiscent of Bad Romance, Poker Face, and Born This Way. There are some terrific hooks and layers in this song and a really catchy chorus.
0385486804|4.0|Definetly a great read for the adventurous at heart. At first I thought the book was going to be told in the perspective of Christopher McCandless, like the movie was.  It was great reading about the other tragic stories of wandering men, it shed alot of light on why there are men who do these trips into wild. Why they were so unwell prepared, is beyond me.
B0002858YS|5.0|Honestly, this is the only CD I love every song on! I've bought this CD about three times because I listen to it so offen. The killers are an amazing group!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is one of the best movies of the series, i was surprised of how faithful the film was to the book, the forest scenes, although it could have been way better like Harry's birthday dinner, Wormtail's death and Harry taking Moody's magical eye. The film was great other than that. I thought that it would've been better if Hagrid would've gave Harry the pouch that comes out in the book, I loved the movie and i can't wait for Part II. I can't wait to hear Harry say \\"I am about to die\\". !  Buy this and Part II and the rest of the movies!
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|I am a huge killers fan and Brandon flowers has an amazing voice. This album is fun and I listen to it everytime I'm in the car! I can't wait to see what Brandon Flowers will do next, hes such a talented artist!!
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) misplaces his father (Jeff Bridges) at an early age. I suppose this has something to do with San growing up with a renegade attitude and a propensity for freedom of information. Then one cat he is mentor Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner) receive a page from a defunct phone line.  The adventure begins as Sam is digitized.  In the process of finding his father he is mesmerize by a cutie (Olivia Wilde) with a secret of her own.  Will he save his father? Will he want too? Will the cutie serve a higher purpose or perish? Let’s have some fun telling Sam not to fall into obvious traps.<br /><br />Of course there has to be updates to the presentation in terms of graphics and complexity as it would be a tad hokey to try to limit us to the original costumes and terminology. But we still get the TRON thrill.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Excellent movie all the way around. I didnt know what to expect when I got it but was more than pleased after watching it (a few times)  Soundtrack is fantastic too.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|\\"This will be our heaviest album ever.\\"<br />  -Dave and the boys<br />Heaviest album my a$$. I'm guessing they meant heavy a different way. Like emotionally heavy. And that's fine. But as foo fans we have no other option but to consider when he says heavy it means he's going to scream his b@!  s off again like you're being punched in the face by your speakers. And he did scream his head off again on this album...for one song. Foo fighters almost broke up after one by one. They should have. It would have been better than being dissapointed again and again and again. Of course, it's not nearly as disheartning as weezer.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|The first disc I received I gave as a christmas gift to my wife. Life is crazy and we never have time to watch movies. We ended up not watching it until well past the return deadline. Some scenes would lock up our bluray player on the 3d disc. Wound up watching 10% of the movie on 2d. I took a look at the 3d disc and the outer edge of the disc looked like the metal they write the data to was crinkled like tin foil. Amazon gave us an exchange, but lesson learned, rush to watch bluray movies you buy, as they don't seem to have good quality control. The exchange wounded up coming with a damaged case and the same crinkled ring on the 2d disc. I ended up putting together the best of the 2 copies and sent back the dilapidated mess. I should knock it more stars for the quality of the disc, but I feel it's isolated. The movie is good, a much more truthful version of the classic book. I loved it esp. all the old creaky english accents and grey palor over the whole scenery. Not quite the movie for children but scrooge's revelation is that much more joyful with the abject misery portrayed in the beginning.
1416955070|4.0|I finally, finally, jumped into this series!  I don't know why it took me so long.  I remember seeing this book back when it came out, and I remember the blurb on it saying it was great for fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and that's me!  Yet, I put it back and ignored it until now, when the series became this bestselling phenomenon.  I think part of the problem was that I thought it would be too much like Buffy, and nothing can live up to that, so off I went.  Well, I really wish I had read this earlier!  Cassandra Clare has created a really unique mythology that had a great mix of everything - werewolves, vampires, demons, monsters, and more.  And the demon hunters, shadow hunters, were not at all too much Buffy-like, so I don't know what I worried about.  The characters are great; I really, really fell in love with Clary and Jace, and Simon too.  I was really, really pulling for a Clary and Jace romance.  I did feel like the book kind of had a slow start, but towards the end it really picks up.  It was kind of unusual reading it, because it is written in third person, and it seems like it's been so long since I've seen a third person omniscient narration!  So that was just different, not bad.  I really liked how it let me get into the character's heads and know everything that was going on.  I also appreciate how descriptive the writing was; it really brought the story to life for me.  One quibble that I had was that a shocking development at the end really took me by surprised, and I was really disappointed by it.  That was not at all where I thought that was heading.  I'll be interested to see what happens with it in the sequel, because during the whole book, I was hoping for something that now we can never get.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I probably should give this 5 stars, because it really is an excellent movie. However, it freaked me out so I had to deduct a point. This isn't a scary movie, but I definitely wouldn't take young children to see it. Put it simply, it's pretty twisted.     Recommended: Yes, but not for kids.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I always get a network error when trying to view auction details with wifi turned on. Turn off wifi and it works OK. Loads main screen with watch list OK on wifi. Need to document error codes as well or use error codes people can understand and fix.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Ok I got this movie for my girlfriend when she was stuck in bed with the flu. It's definitely not a \\"guy-movie\\", but it is full of cute girls in practically no clothing. Alright alright, the story line isn't too hateful and let's face it, Christina and Cher have got a great set of pipes (those girls can SING)!    If you need some brownie points with the Mrs., buy this (flowers and chocolate work too).    Recommended: Yes
0670022411|5.0|I'll admit I was skeptical when I first started Deborah Harkness' \\"A Discovery of Witches\\".  The book seemed just a little too campy to me, but it was receiving such rave reviews, I just had to give it a try.  Two chapters in and I was totally hooked.  The story, which seems simple enough--nerdy witch meets charming and potentially dangerous vampire, who seems to be interested in a manuscript the witch has mysteriously unearthed--but Harkness develops the story into so much more, introducing a host of interesting characters, locations, and a ton of rich detail.  Although the plot becomes somewhat predictable pretty fast, Harkness does a good job of keeping it interesting with accurate historical details and interesting details and story quirks.  I love all of the back stories she slowly unfolds for her characters, each one pulling me a little bit further into the story.<br /><br />By the middle of the book, I felt like I was rushing to the end, because I just had to know how it ended.  This is my favorite kind of book, where the pages seems to be turning themselves.  Unfortunately, I soon realized this must be part of a series, because there weren't enough pages left to finish the fantastic story of Diana and Matthew and Ashmole 782.  Now that I've finished, I can't wait for the sequel!<br /><br />Fans of historical fiction, fantasy (especially female Harry Potter fans!), and witches should read this book!  It's a new twist on the popular witches and vampires themes.
B0041KKYD8|1.0|This tepid remake of the cult classic \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\" is the very dictionary definition of the phrase \\"no reason to exist\\". The original is better in just about every conceivable way; from the low budget gritty quality, to the very plot itself, Meier Zarchi's original movie is so much better than this wanna-be torture porn entry that it renders THIS movie absolutely pointless. If you're going to watch one version of this film, make it the original, and save yourself the aggravation of the added stupidity that this rock-dumb retelling piles on by the barrel. I'd give specific examples, but I don't think Amazon allows that much room.    As for the Blu-Ray quality....that's actually moot here because movies like this one are actually better served by looking older and grittier, hence another advantage the original has over this \\"too slick by a MILE\\" remake. I just wonder when Hollywood is going to learn that when something becomes famous because it's sleazy, dirty feel makes people feel gross for having watched it, the right idea is NOT to then gloss up and beautify that film and remake it to look like a billion bucks....part of the appeal is the \\"grindhouse\\" look and feel, which is absolutely absent from this movie.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I've listened to this for the past 4 hours, I'm finding it very difficult to stop.  There are AT LEAST 7 tracks that I'm in love with and they are as follows...      1.Bridge Burning  2.Rope  3.Dear Rosemary  5.Arlandria  6.These Days  10.I Should Have Known  11.Walk    The other songs are all very good aswell, but so far these 7 have really stood out in my mind.  I'm seeing these guys in about a month, this release has very much heightened my degree of anticipation, although it was high to begin with.
B001H9JBW6|5.0|I initially bought this so my husband could share my passion for British drama. The fact that technology was the enemy made it all the more interesting.This is a drama that keeps you guessing who the good guys and who the bad guys are.   We literally hated as each episode ended. We could not wait to start the next episode.  If you are an Anglophile,a techno geek,or just enjoy good strong drama,this is a show for you.[[ASIN:B001H9JBW6 The Last Enemy]]    ENJOY--we did!
0316069353|5.0|Another great book from the master.  There was a little too much courtroom detail for me, it was tedious in places.  I also don't like the over-involvement with his first wife and unresolved relationship.  What really works though is another good twisty who's the murderer AND enough focus on the humanity of the maybe sleazy protagonist to make him an interesting developed character without hammering it home.  Anxiously waiting for his next book whether it be Harry Bosch or Mickey Haller.
B000TERK3C|5.0|This album is breathtaking.  This is not wordplay, it actively took my breath away on many occasions.  I cannot believe that somehow I'd missed this album all these years. I'm not much of a Radiohead fan, yet for this I can change my mind.  It is deep, complex, awkward, and passionate.  I am still a little in shock.
0375847227|4.0|To start with, I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  It was imaginative, interesting and hard to put down.   I do however resent how the publishers in the United states think that people are so stupid as to not publish the book as it was originally written.   At the time I purchased the book I was not aware of this, next time I would try and find a proper version.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I subscribe to multiple music services, and nothing really beats the cost of ownership and convenience of amazon mp3s and cloud storage. Internet radio is a great way to discover new music, but there's still no better be value for owning and now storing your music than amazon.   On a side note, giving an android app one star because it doesn't work on a particular piece of hardware is like giving a movie a bad review because the projector failed. Android is fragmented, but the bugs usually get worked out.  The freedom that we enjoy with android carries some occasional inconvenience.   Bottom line: this is a great app and service.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I can't really think of any other band that is playing real genuine rock n' roll, outside of the Foo Fighters.  Is this their best album?  Close, but probably not.  Their first two are classics and have their best songs on them.  We also hold older music up higher sometimes, too, so it's hard to judge a album that's less than one week old.      Bottom line is, every song on this one is a keeper.  These are their most \\"catchy\\" songs, by far.  Listen to the album maybe three times and you'll have all the songs stuck in your head.  I think every song here is above average, but I'm having a hard time liking \\"Walk\\".  People are gushing over this one, but I'm just not feeling it.  It's the final song, which sometimes can be the worst song on a disc, but if that song is their worst then it tells you how solid the disc is.      This is a five star CD, no doubt about it.  It's raw, it's from the heart and most of all it rocks.  Even the songs that start out slow or quiet, you think it's a ballad and then \\"BAM\\" in come the heavy guitars.      Keep rocking and keep making music like this and become the Led Zeppelin of this era!
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This is a really great pdf reader.  I found that the text is crisp and easy to read.  The layout is easy to use. I would have to rank this in the top 5 pdf readers. ezPDF is not as fast as quick office but I like the gui on ez better.   I have explored the options and there are limits to what you can do to customize the app. I had hoped to find an option to turn off the &quot;page turning&quot; animation but there isn't one.   Overall it is still one of the better pdf readers on the market.
B00000J0O2|4.0|Super Deal advertised NEW Original HP Toner. I ordered two toner cartridges which arrived loosely in a perfect box. The toner boxes however; one looked like a child's artwork project, and the with a rather largely dented corner. Needless to say, I was not impressed and was uncertain if the one was damaged.  Upon contacting the company, they pleasantly sent me out two perfectly packaged toner cartridges, and a return tag for the original shipment. Thank you for the quick correction, but still a little disappointed that they first chose to send poor quality.
B0000020T3|5.0|Don't let the review about bad sound scare you off this gem.  This sounds exactly as the original LP did in 76.  Now that be may good or bad for you kids who have only listened to cds, and remastered cds in your lifetime, but for us old guys that started out with actual vinyl...it's OK.  As far as the music itself well...if you like the British Invasion, The Rutles, their imitators The Beatles, then this is for you.  As I said - had the original album, played the dickens out of it and 34 years later had to have the CD.  Well worth the import price !This cd is just fun and anything that has Dave Edmunds association (producer) is gonna be good.  God save the Groovies!

0756404738|3.0|I won't go into the same rhetoric that many other reviewers have aptly conveyed already, just to say that I echo the \\"complaint\\" that there were too many dragged out sequences.  The one that was the worst for me was the time with the Adem.  That really should have been alot more exciting, but it was so tedious, the fact that Kvothe was becoming a bad-ass could not make it better.  Also, the time with Felurian, while important in many ways as we found out later near the end, was just a bit overdone as well.  I guess the fact that a good book got drawn out a bit much is not that bad of a thing all in all, but since the anticipation for this book from so promising a new author was at such a fever pitch, that I am compelled to write my opinion on what bothered me.  Mr. Rothfuss, scale it back a bit please, I love detail but this was a bit too much tedium!!!!  You are brilliant though, and I wish I could write half as good as you!!!!
0670022411|5.0|I can see whether you either love or hate this book.  I loved it!  Loved the characters, the story, and the imaginative qualities found throughout.  A great read!  This is a book to read purely for the enjoyment of a very interesting story.  Even though I wanted to know what the end would bring, I really was sorry I finished the book!  Looking forward to book 2 :)
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A little trite on the excesses of Wall St. (drugs, prostitution), but the rest is spot on.  You'll get mad watching it, and wonder just where is the accountability for it all - until you realize that they (Wall St.) are running YOUR government.  And they are not watching out for you.      Sadly, I had to rent it as I don't have enough money to buy it :)

B0043RT8JU|5.0|Ever since third grade I have had a book superglued to my hand. I've read A LOT of books, but none have made me laugh or (almost) cry as much as this one. Paper Towns is one of the most amazing books I have ever read! *Spoiler Alert* When they are on the 21 hour road trip, I have never EVER laughed as hard as I did while reading that section. I don't even laugh much, but this book has had me rolling on the ground in stitches, something that I thought only brainless giggle-freaks did.   I COULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK MORE HIGHLY!!!!
B004LAIU4I|4.0|It has been five years since Paul Simon's last studio album, but the time between releases has not diminished his talents or artistry in the least.  If anything, he sounds even more confident and assured of his music and his place in the rock landscape than ever before and that resonates throughout \\"So Beautiful or So What\\", which is his best album sine 2000's \\"You're The One\\".<br /><br />Musically this album finds Simon delivering some of his most rhythmic compositions since 1990's \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\", a fact that is apparent from the very first cut to the superb title track which closes the album. But unlike \\"Saints\\" or even \\"Graceland\\", this album isn't steeped primarily in African music. \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" nstead weaves those sounds together with folk and gospel resulting in thoroughly original and invigorating compositions.<br /><br />Lyrically, Simon is as sharp as ever using the 10 tracks compiled here to ruminate on life, love, God and faith.  All of which rings true since he draws on nearly seventy years worth of life experience to address these themes.  Simon's ceartinty of and peace with his station in life has freed him artistically and allowed him to write an album's worth of songs about the things in life that truly matter to him.  It may be a different approach than he has employed in the past, but it exemplifies the manner in which the creative process changes with one's age and experiences.  One suspects that Paul Simon is far from finshed growing and exploring as an artist and if this album is any indication, that time is not coming anytime soon.  That is what has allowed him to remain creatively ablaze after all these years.....and to have released one of the best albums of 2011.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Within Temptation are known for not cutting any corners, and that's certainly the case with this fantastic Blu-Ray package. Overkill might actually be the word; playing for 15,000 people in a huge arena, with a complete symphonic orchestra, a complete choir, special dancers, enormous screens, absurdly overblown costumes and plenty of groovy pyrotechnics. And again; all of that had to go off without a hitch because it was being recorded in high-definition.<br /><br />The show looks fantastic, sure, but what's more, sounds phenomenal. You get not two, not three, but *five* audio options, stretching from what's sure to be a really solid PCM Stereo-track (if there is such a thing) all the way to a mammoth DTS 96kHz/24-bit track. I haven't had the chance to flip between them yet, but I'd recommend trying any of the three surround-tracks available, maybe there's one most suitable for your setup. Whatever you choose to go with, this is an epic show of fantastic grandeur; the choir, orchestra and band will conquer your living room. Even if there are more sublte moments to the show, overall it's loud and huge, as it ought to be. I was especially hooked by \\"The Howling\\" and \\"What Have You Done\\", but my absolute favourite track of the show is \\"Hand Of Sorrow\\". That song is monumentally *huge*, and everyone is really into it.<br /><br />Beyond the (two hour) behemoth of a show, there are of course extras, and plenty of them. Three documentaries on the band and their special night, one bonus concert (that's really decent, and also has plenty of audio options to choose from, wow!), all of their music videos from the \\"Heart\\"-album cycle, over an hour of tour impressions (Sharon filming whatever she can across the world), plus some live performances from an award show, a photoshoot and recording with the orchestra. Most (if not all) of it is their native tongue of Dutch, but it's all subtitled in English. The discs (one BR, one DVD) come packaged in a regular tiny little Blu-Ray case, joined only by a little flipbook of photos. All that content and power within such a tiny plastic casing.<br /><br />You don't have to be a hardcore WT-fan to enjoy their DVDs and Blu-Rays. [[ASIN:B000BSNPRG The Silent Force Tour]] was also a great package, of a more intimate show, and this is the next bold step. My only recommendation is to make sure you can go all out; a big full high-definition television, a decent 5.1 (or better) surround system, and an environment where you don't upset family or neighbours. Then buy the disc, crank up the sound and prepare for a night of unparalleled grandeur.by a little flipbook of photos. All that content and power within such a tiny plastic casing.

0307394549|2.0|I immediately went to get this book after reading all these amazing reviews. I tried a few recipes and some turned out okay but there were some that tasted terrible. I'm not sure if it's because my baking skills are horrible or I just happen to pick the recipes that weren't tested? All in all, I love the variety of recipes the book offers (with some tastey looking pictures) but unforuntately the book wasn't much help for me!

B004FLIXVS|5.0|The sound quality is great, but the price blows. It's way too expensive. There are so many live PJ albums out there already. I haven't bought this, but I listened to my friends copy and it does sound amazing. Still, why is it so expensive? The packaging is nice, but nothing special. Maybe when I can get it on Amazon for 5 dollars used I will purchase it. Not worth the price considering the amount of PJ live albums already available.

0756405890|5.0|I was in a bookshop recently where people seemed to be congregating around a stand of books. Upon investigation I discovered the book was called The Wise Man's Fear. The second in a fantasy trilogy. It seemed to be in high demand so I went home with the first book, The Name of the Wind. And so began the tale of Kvothe. The story is in two parts. Present day Kvothe who runs an inn and tells the story of Kvothe from the past.     The majority of the book focuses on Kvothe's experiences and struggles as he grows up. You can't help but admire Kvothe's intelligence and resilience in the face of hardships that no 12 year old boy should experience. The book is peppered with eccentric and mysterious characters that draw you further into its pages.  In my opinion the best years of Kvothe's story so far are those when he is attending the University. This is where you learn about the magic in the world and just how powerful Kvothe has become. Rothfuss's ability to take magic and fantasy and turn it into something completely believable makes this an exceptional novel. The unanswered questions at the end leave the reader wanting more!

B004CLYKLI|2.0|Is this woman for real? I know many Chinese-American families and while they seem stricter than most Westerners, they absolutely do not raise (or should I say browbeat?) their children this way. This woman is a complete control freak who is raising robots and I doubt whether these girls will thank her as adults. It is important to have structure for your children but this is insane! These girls have had no childhood. This woman is either playing a big practical joke on her readers, or she is one pathetic lady.
B0031ESW8O|5.0|Written in the late 1850's, \\"The Woman in White\\" is a page turning tour-de-force thriller, holding enough suspense and out-of-the-blue left turns to keep even the most jaded of suspense novel fans reading late into the night.<br />  The story starts off when the narrator, a young art teacher, encounters a mysterious woman in white walking the lonely roads of England late one night.  He helps the woman find safety only to later discover that she has escaped from a mental asylum and is wanted by the authorities.  Things only get stranger when the narrator gets hired to tutor two young women and discovers that one of them bears a striking resemblance- almost twin-like- to the woman in white.  As the narrator begins to investigate this coincidence, and begins to fall in love as he does so, all manners of deceit, treachery, confusion, and events simply inexplicable begin to pile up.<br />  Every time you think you know what is going on, Wilkie Collins switches gears and heads off in another direction.  As the story progresses, several people- one of the young women, a lawyer, servants, even one of the supposed villains- steps up and takes over the narration, slowly putting together more and more pieces of what may or may not be a mystery.<br />  The writing is masterful.  The suspense ranks up there with literature's best, and the character development creates living, breathing humans who provide the reader an emotional investement into the story.<br />  For a book I had never heard of until recently, \\"The Woman in White\\" is one of literature's greatest suspense novels.
630521610X|5.0|I love this movie!!! This trilogy has to be the most genius of horror trilogies. It has the horror slasher factor along with humor. Wes Craven is mocking the typical horror slasher films and does it perfectly! The reason people rate this movie with low ratings is they don't get what Wes Craven was trying to do. Once you do get it these movies are really good if you get it. If you still don't love it, that is fine at least you know what Wes Craven was trying to do.
0316069485|4.0|Reversal #1: A 24 year old conviction for child molestation and murder is reversed based on new DNA evidence. Reversal #2: Criminal Defense Attorney Mickey \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" Haller is appointed Special Independent Prosecutor to handle the re-trial. The fun begins. Haller selects his half brother, LAPD Det. Harry Bosch, and his (Haller's) L.A. County Assistant District Attorney X wife to be on his team. Connelly takes us through the pre-trial, the trial and the unexpected, at least by me, ending, one step at a time, in a way that makes you want to learn \\"what happens next?\\"      Others have commented at length on the story, so let me comment on how Connelly tells his story. First, he has an interesting story to tell. No two ways about it. I was pretty quickly hooked, and always wanted to learn more. Second, he tells his interesting story in a credible way. I have been a practicing courtroom lawyer for a long time and had no trouble suspending disbelief and getting into this book. I often have trouble suspending disbelief when I read \\"lawyer stories\\", because they contain plot lines and actions that would never happen in a million years, and characters that would never come along in 250 years. No such problems with this book. Third, Connelly carefully builds his story one credible layer at a time. He never just slops a bunch of stuff on a page as some authors do, perhaps because they have written themselves into a corner. He builds each chaper one credible layer of information at a time, and his chapters are built one upon the next. Fourth, without detracting at all from his story, he raises some serious issues about the legal system.     The result is a very good book. Interesting, believable, fun to read and when I was done, I immediately started Connelly's newest book.
0316069884|4.0|Imagine enjoying a pleasant picnic with a group of close friends. With a large variety of food provided--fried chicken, potato salad, fruits, biscuits, etc.-- plenty is available for even the pickiest eater. You grab a drumstick and are about to dig your teeth into its meaty flesh when suddenly, your best friend blurts out,   \\"You aren't really going to eat that, are you?\\" she asks.   And with that one, simple question, you have a choice. You could have a life changing experience, realizing that the meat you are about to consume used to be an animal that had feelings and emotions, or you could simply shrug your shoulders and continue to eat the meat without another thought.   According to Jonathan Foer, author of Eating Animals, pointing out the realities of meat-eating to as many people as possible is the ethical thing to do. And taking into account the horrors of slaughterhouses that Foer has seen firsthand, this opinion, though possibly seen as rude to many, isn't so radical. In Eating Animals, Foer offers upfront information regarding the realities that these animals face for their entire life. From the birth of these farm animals (that can occur only because of artificial insemination and genetic modification,) to their ultimate death in the slaughterhouse, the facts about the torture of farm animals are enough to make any reader stop and think about what they are eating.    Eating Animals is the perfect book for anyone who wants blunt, upfront information regarding the lives of the animals we eat. Uncensored and gruesomely honest, Foer offers the facts, hoping that you will choose the ethical decision and feel enough passion for animals to persuade others to do the same. Ultimately, Foer makes it clear through a variety of personal anecdotes, facts about slaughterhouses, and an array of first person opinions that no matter whether you decide to continue eating the fried chicken you picked up, or to choose potato salad instead, eating food is an entirely ethical decision.
B003UESJ9W|2.0|If you like depressing movies this is one to watch. This movie isn't really about country music success it is about characters with tortured souls. Disappointing and depressing.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|Darren Aronofsk'y latest film Black Swan would make for a marvelous double header either with 80's cult classic Mommy Dearest or perhaps Tommy Wiseau's The Room. Is this supposed to be a serious film? If not then bravo, Aronofsky was able to pull one over on the film going public better than Verhoeven did with Showgirls.    Oh man, there's this dame and she's all prissy and sweet and then there's this other girl that shows up and she swears and smokes and she's all naughty and stuff. Something about an abusive mom, vincent cassel keeps trying to act (and continues to fail) a few cliche insanity scenes and fade out to death.     Awesome.    For a vastly superior depiction of a woman losing her mind do yourself a favor and sit down and watch John Cassavetes' film A Woman Under the Influence.
B00004BZ0N|3.0|Sorry to be a Negative Nellie but there were boatloads--domestic and Brit--full of Incredible Music in the time of Clash. They were at par with some of it. But otherwise, in my humble opinion, this group is to punk as were the King's New Clothes to his cowed subjects. And to this day they are adored and fawned upon as though they ever did anything original or god forbid, showed any overt signs of talent. Then, as now, every moment I've spent listening to The Clash only serves to remind me of the numerous groups that were overlooked, so much better, now forgotten. I think this group mostly appeals to the folk that were too embarrassed to admit that they really, really did like Stevie Nicks.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|If you have no interest in spirituality, avoid HEREAFTER. However, if you've ever seriously asked yourself, \\"What happens to me after death?,\\" you'll be as intrigued by the storyline as I was. On a subliminal level, we all want to know what lies beyond but most of us march through life, seeing friends and loved ones fall by the wayside while stubbornly we forge ahead clutching the delusion that it won't happen to us.<br /><br />Director-Producer Clint Eastwood, born 1930, is approaching that journey to the ultimate unknown. It is only fitting that he should, through compelling subplots, examine some of the known aspects of 'passing away' as told by those who were clinically dead, moved on for a few minutes, and were then jolted back into their bodies. (NDE - Near Death Experience)<br /><br />The \\"boring slowness,\\" of which some viewers complain, is time well spent in not only developing the on-screen personalities of the five leading characters, including the brooding George Lonegan (Matt Damon) but also, to a limited degree, their psychological makeup.<br /><br />Action-Adventure fans will enjoy HEREAFTER only if their forays and explorations include mining the depths of human emotion. Otherwise... let it pass. It's a motion picture requiring attentive thought and post-viewing reflection.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has once again given the world a cinematic masterpiece in the movie HEREAFTER.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|It seemed, when I received it in the mail, like a black market dvd. It didn't have the usual \\"security\\" stickers on it and no booklet on the inside of the cover so it felt as if I was getting one of those black market products made in Mexico....oh wait... this dvd IS made in Mexico... my bad hahahaha All-in-all, the story isn't half bad except for the corny bits...yeah...legs bending backwards- made me laugh.
0439023521|4.0|Gotta admit, this book hooked me from start to finish. I'd heard it was for kids, but this is definitely for adults. In fact I don't know I'd let anyone under 14 read it. Plotwise it IS a bit rehashed from Battle Royale, but there are sci fi elements that make this a version unique to itself, and I can't wait to see the film.  Just an all around good read.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Someday we will be saying \\"You know he's 60?\\" just like we do with The Stones and Aerosmith.  Foo Fighters is a forever band.  I am saying this is their best work which is hard since I thought The Color and The Shape was their penultimate.  I can't wait to say that about their next album where the guys have gotten even more life experience.  You can hear the realness of life in the lyrics. When I hear this I feel like \\"me\\", not some corporate drone...mom in the form of ATM...I feel like \\"ME\\"!!
B002ZG997C|5.0|Even though I'm an agnostic, I've grown weary of standard Hollywood junk in which religion is portrayed as near evil and religious people as fools.  'The Book of Eli' and a film I just reviewed, 'Frailty', are major exceptions to this general rule.  Eli, although not the returned Messiah, is his prophet in the desert of a ravaged earth.<br /><br />The earth has been savaged by an apolcalyptic war and ignorance rules the land.  He who has pre-apocalyptic knowledge has the potential for great and destructive power and there are those who will kill to learn its secrets.  Eli, in a way similar to the demi-God, Achilles, in the Iliad, has been touched by the eternal and is--unfortunately for his enemies--virtually immune to danger and evil.  He is the agent by which the world may be saved.
B003UESJHY|5.0|This movie is not a straight-up boxing movie. It's a movie about the struggles of life with boxing as the canvas to show a man's overcoming of the obstacles life and his family have placed before him. Great film. Christian Bale is superb. Excellent PQ on Blu-ray. Highly recommended.
B003EYVXSW|4.0|Fairly standard Science-Horror stuff albeit well done with good special effects.  I watched the last part of it on HBO and was intrigued as to how a DNA splicing could produce a creature that appeared to be 70% woman, 15% cat, 5% rabbit and 10% bird.  I watched and even rewatched the first part of the film but must admit that the science was a bit thin.  Of course, this is characteristic of all Science-Horror films.<br /><br />My guess is that, if it were possible to 'splice' all these species together, it would look a lot like the slugs that these brilliant scientists originally produced.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the best calendar I have found for Android.  The day view is the same as the Google Calendar web view.  It also lets me move an event from one calendar to another,  which the built-in calendar on my HTC EVO 4G can't do.  The only downside is that there can be a lot of lag in the calendar at times.  However, I still think this is the best calendar out there right now.
0618918248|5.0|Let me start off by giving my personal opinion about this book, which is first and foremost the purpose of these reviews. This book is absolutely awesome! The way the chapters take you through a thought provoking journey, and the way that Mr Dawkins fearlessly expresses this very important topic is amazing. I'd give it ten stars if I could. This book is an example of a human being that has achieved the true definition of FREE THOUGHT. There is almost nothing more satisfying than to free your mind and thoughts. Religion has been a major player in enslaving people's minds and lives for centuries. And just like one of the comments written on the back cover states...\\"If this book doesn't change the world, we're all screwed.\\"  I feel that this world is far from being free of religion. As long as we humans continue to have the same primitive fears, and lack of accepting life, nature, and existence for what it is and not for what we wish it were, religion will continue to exist and thrive for generations to come. I know that Richard Dawkins has the reputation of being a bit agressive with the subject of religion and gods, but I personally do not blame him for being that way. We humans have the most intellectually evolved brains in the animal kingdom, but at times we do not seem to be the smartest at all.  And when it comes to topics like religion and theology, I feel (and most non-believers do) that it brings out the worst in human intelligence and reasoning. We need to pass on books like this to our children and future generations. And we need more renegades like Richard Dawkins. (By the way, my favorite is chapter 7.)
B004GHNHVW|5.0|This is a very strong album from Paul Simon. Some people are calling it his best since Graceland, and I believe that's true. But I also believe this statement misses the point, which is not so much to make facile comparisons and rankings but to see the album for what it is -- a very thoughtful, extremely well-crafted statement from a master songwriter who is looking all around. Not just looking back, but also looking around at the world and himself today as well as looking forward, and seeing things through a more spiritual lens than in his earlier days.<br /><br />I bought the CD/DVD combo hoping I'd love the \\"making of\\" documentary, with visions of the \\"Classic Albums\\" series of music documentaries dancing in my head -- lengthy, detailed and fascinating. My mistake. The documentary is good for what it is, but the total run time is 7:59, and it is already up on YouTube. As is the four-minute music video for \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\\" (which is great, by the way). What's left is an audio-only \\"live rehearsal\\" of the title track \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\". Nice, interesting, an technically another 4 minutes of content, but not really essential on a DVD.<br /><br />I am glad I got the CD because of the booklet, which has a nice little lionizing introduction by Elvis Costello as well as the lyrics and credits -- did you know the album was co-produced by Phil Ramone, of all people, and released by the Starbucks group? But all this information would have been available on [[ASIN:B004V7EW66 the version of the MP3 download album that has the digital booklet]]. Knowing what I know now, that's the edition I'd get.<br /><br />The music itself is among Simon's best, in my view -- but yours may be different. I definitely could pick a nit or two in places I felt he was coming awfully close to repeating some of his previous work. But I really loved some of the things he did with taking phrases that are dissonant and even vaguely unpleasant on their own, but which become attractive and catchy through repetition in the right melodic and rhythmic context. This is seen in guitar fills on \\"The Afterlife\\" and the bass line in \\"Dazzling Blue\\", for example. And the use of the kora in \\"Rewrite\\" is awesome.<br /><br />Lyrically, Simon has still got it. My favorite right now is from \\"Rewrite\\", about a guy who works in a car wash but really considers himself a screenwriter. It contains this verse: \\"I'll eliminate the pages / Where the father has a breakdown / And he has to leave the family / But he really meant no harm / I'm gonna substitute a car chase / And a race across the rooftops / When the father saves the children / And he holds them in his arms.\\" Apart from the clear comment on the nature of Hollywood screenwriting, on a deeper level I think this is a pretty great metaphor for our desire to rewrite the less positive aspects of our lives and replace them with something more attractive.<br /><br />This is just one example, but the album has fantastic lyrics all around. Some have complained that it is a religious album. I don't agree with that, but it does have many references to love and God. You can even see Jesus in there if you squint at the right angle (\\"Love and Hard Times\\" is about what \\"God and his only son\\" do when they pay a visit to earth). This is still far from a \\"Christian rock\\" album, though. It is spiritual without being religious.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

0375842209|5.0|I stayed up until 0130 last night to finish this book. Finally went to sleep around 0315. It has haunted me all day. This should be required reading in the schools, considering the current political climate and simmering anti-Muslim sentiment so rampant in the world. It's not too hard to imagine a repeat, what with the far right conservative agenda insidiously out shouting common sense and compassion for those who don't fit the \\"christian, god fearing, light skinned\\" moneyed class. The book manages to make one chuckle at times, cry at others, and deliver a powerful and chilling message about the hell on earth that humans are capable of creating.
1400064287|5.0|This is unlike most books of this genre. For the simple reason that  it does a better job of helping the reader understand and internalize the concepts and put them to practice in the real world. It's like a textbook in that sense with practice material thrown in. But a textbook which is interesting, enjoyable and very readable.     The writers were inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point\\" and have made an attempt to build on the \\"idea being sticky\\" concept outlined in the book. They have succeeded in doing so.

B0041KKYDI|5.0|I can't remember the last time I had such a visceral and emotional reaction to a movie...and no, it didn't have anything to do with him cutting off his arm!  This film was powerful on a cerebral, not graphic level.  Sure, the blood is there, but nothing more than you would see on network primetime (think CSI).  I'm actually surprised it garnered an \\"R\\" rating.  However, what makes this film better than great is the realization Ralston comes to.  In his darkest hour he accepts that he is not perfect and, understanding his own imperfections, moves forward with a survival instinct that would cause many others to crumble.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough!  For the true adventurer it does not make you afraid of the wild, it makes you want to go out and challenge yourself even further!

B0002ADY24|3.0|With the sacking of David Byron in the summer of '76 and John Wetton jumping ship soon thereafter, Hensley, Box and Kerslake needed to regroup and begin anew with Uriah Heep. Trevor Bolder(ex-David Bowie) was recruited first and then upon the recommendation of Roger Glover to Ken Hensley, Former Lucifer's Friend vocalist John Lawton was hired. The music within Firefly is fresh, yet, a bit more commercially driven in parts; but nonetheless, a very worthy and lasting release within the group's repetoire. Hanging Tree is an outlaw's tale driven by Lawton's soulful vocal, the steady beat and rhythm of Bolder/Kerslake anchoring and Box and Hensley's guitar and keys riding the melody along respectively. Been Away Too Long reminds me a little of Foreigner at times, and is a bit strange. But the time period of the mid to late seventies rock bands was that of a smooth and glossy type of sound. Bands like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac would hone this radio-friendly style to amazingly successful heights, albeit, in terms of stadium concerts and millions of records sold.<br /><br /> Firefly has these qualities no doubt, for wanting to be included in these areas, and other tracks like Do You Know, Who Needs Me(by Kerslake) and Sympathy fit the bill, for sure. However, The title track is a greatly arranged number that sustains this record; its a number that is arranged with a melodic synth line and features great vocal harmonies interlaid within the opening and closing structures of the track. Rollin' On is ponderous and moody, Wise Man actually was a big hit in Europe and is another Ballad-type of song. Once again, the Sanctuary remaster is full of outtake material here and the outtakes featured in Crime of Passion, A Far Better Way and I Always Knew should've perhaps, been included on the original release, but despite them being cutting floor tracks, thankfully they've been restored on the inclusion of this remaster as proof of their strength and validity within this transitional phase of the group. Firefly is a solid release and began yet another phase for the band, which, while it allowed them the freedom to continue performing, Heep were at a commercial crossroads and each proceeding release would see them become further and further diluted into mainstream and losing a bit of earthy-ness to that which they had become known for and met the greatest success with. Firefly isn't in the same league as Demons and Wizards or Magician's Birthday, but it does offer a fresh slant and updated style for the group to maintain a certain, and perhaps broader commercial-like appeal. 3 solid stars.
B002AKPECW|3.0|This is my first and possibly last Alastair Reynolds book.  Previously I had been reading a bunch of Iain M Banks and Greg Egans.    The story itself was fine (probably good, even), but the characters were not.  They frequently acted in unbelievably irrational ways that seemed like blatant mechanisms to push the plot forward.  This might have been explained away with sufficient character development, the latter didn't exist.
B0000073YB|5.0|Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret (NSEC) for me is a very fine album (I think one of the best in 1981), that stood the test of time well. It combines catchy infectious hooks/melodies with Marc Almond's quite sinister, bleak and 'dirty' view on life. So that somehow the poppy upbeat music stands in a certain contrast to the often bleak and sleazy lyrics.     I find it a shame that Soft Cell in some countries are deemed as just another one-hit wonder, because they had so much more to offer than \\"Tainted Love\\" (at least on this album), and \\"Tainted Love\\" is not even an original composition of Soft Cell (written by Ed Cobb and first recorded by Gloria Jones).     I will give a brief outline of the most remarkable (or most unremarkable) songs:  \\"Frustration\\" is quite disappointing for me, compared to the original version found on the Mutant Moments EP. The upbeat and 'jazzy' music here somehow doesn't fit the very desperate, angry lyrics by Marc Almond.     \\"Tainted Love\\"; don't care much at all anymore for this song. I mean, it's a decent song, but it was so overplayed on radio stations, that now I'm quite fed up of it (and it's not even an original composition by Soft Cell, the lyrics not very representative of Soft Cell's usual themes).    \\"Youth\\" is one of my favourite songs on the CD, very grown-up, slow, poignant and even darker than the rest of the album, with lyrcis about the bleak insight that, well, 'youth has gone'. It's only a shame that it's so short (but gives a good hint of things to come on subsequent albums).    \\"Sex Dwarf\\" is a real killer, their take on Eurodisco, but rawer, more uncontrolled and quite pervy. It combines a stomping beat, 'sleazy' sounding synthesizers with lots of 'dirty' voices, moans, strange noise and brilliant lyrics by Marc Almond's that veer between sensuality/lust and dark sarcasm.    \\"Entertain Me\\", \\"Chips On My Shoulder\\", \\"Bedsitter\\", and \\"Secret Life\\" are all more or less bout frustrations of every day life, displeasure, decadence, negative tendencies and eventual perversion. Again combining catchy melodious hooks with bleak, dark sarcastic lyrics.     \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\" is quite pompous and theatrical, with Marc Almond's impassionate (and a bit camp) torch singing about the end of an affair, a pleasing closer to the original album.    A few of the bonus tracks are also worth a mention:  \\"Memorabilia\\" was their first single. To me it is not a typical song for Soft Cell, with the music being quite mechanic and repititive (similar to Kraftwerk or Suicide), and Marc Almond's vocals quite 'cold' and dispassionate compared to his usual passionate torch singing (and the lyrics seem a bit bland and unfocussed on this one, unlike the otherwise very direct and derisive lyrics found on Soft Cell songs).    \\"Facility Girls\\" is a nice little tune (unfortunately again quite short), with a bit reminiscence of Suicide, but this song is more Soft Cell nonetheless, as though the music's catchy and upbeat, with further listen also a subtle hint of bleakness/gloom seems to appear (typical of Soft Cell) through Marc's derisive vocals, the sound of the synthesizers etc. (the lyrics on the other hand are quite innocent, unlike the 12inch version with extended lyrics where the true meaning of this song comes about {it's about a young woman, her hapless life and desolate feelings, this being another classic of Soft Cell's bleak urban synthpop}).    \\"Fun City\\" is a quite 'epic' (long), minimalistic and snappy song, reminiscent of the earliest pre-NSEC Soft Cell sound (e.g. found on Demo Non Stop). Again it combines fast upbeat music/melodious hooks with dark bleak lyrics about someone, well lost in 'Fun City' (London), which turns out to be no fun at all.    \\"Torch\\" features again Marc Almon's passionate torch singing, about, well 'looking for love in a sad song', with (like said in the booklet) Marc's wavering voice countering the cold perfection of the synthesizers.  \\"Insecure Me\\" is the nice b-side to this (again combing the catchy/dancable with the sinister/bleak).    I don't care much about the song \\"What?\\" (another cover version), but find the instrumental \\"...So\\" a pleasing closer to the expanded disc (showing that Dave Ball could write one or two nice tunes without Marc Almond's singing on it {though I think Soft Cell's instrumentals are not as good as those of the early Human League}).    All in a all a pleasant and fulfilling listening, the more so with this expanded edition of bonus tracks, decent remastering and insightful liner notes by Richard Smith.     To put in a nutshell, one of the things I really love about Soft Cell (at least on this album) is the ability to combines upbeat songs, catchy/infectious melodies with Marc Almond's bleak, sinisiter and sleazy take on life.     At the end I'd like to put a few quotes from the liner notes make the point even more clear:   \\"BEDSITTER was about not the fun fun fun of going out with the beautiful people, but the absolute hell of daily lives of unremitting loneliness and poverty.\\"  \\"...a Forties image grafted on to something personal, which is living in really grotty bedsits in Leeds, going out at night to clubs, looking glamorous and I suppose pretending to enjoy yourself. Sort of mixing reality with the fantasy, the glitter with the squalor. Like I used to wonder about these really glamorous people: What do they look like when they're doing the dishes?\\"  \\"Whereas pop since its inception has dreamt of escape, of leaving the small town for the big city, only Almond was willing to reveal the dirt behind the dream, the tears of the clowns of club culture.\\"    Just highly recommended.
0553386816|5.0|Seven wonderful tales from the dark edges of a small town in Mississippi. Stories about life's losers--characters who drink too much, gamble too much, people on the fringes of the legal profession who play tricks on people for a living, a man on death row who hounds his family for money for nonexistent teams of defense lawyers, a young man from the uppercrust who comes home to die of AIDS and is shunned, a car full of drinkers going to Memphis to give blood for a distant friend, but never make it. And more. Characters you wouldn't want to meet or do business with, but, somehow you like them.<br /><br />I didn't want this book to end but, sadly, it did. Author Grisham has tapped into the basic humanity of these losers and made them real. They'll haunt you long after you set the book down for the last time. For sometimes these losers are smarter than the winners. This is one book I can't recommend too highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album is top notch. The past couple Foo albums have been criticized for the mellow sound. Whether that criticism was warranted or not, each previous album was a stepping stone building up to what Wasting Light is all about. It's heavier, reminiscent of The Colour and the Shape. Where that album was more raw energy mixed with creativity, this album feels more like focused energy tapping in to what they've learned through their career poured into one hard rock album. I don't know how much to attribute to Pat Smear's return to the recording lineup, but everything has really come together for this group on these songs. Kudos to them. I hope they get all the props they rightly deserve for such a great album.

There are no short cuts to becoming an accomplished painter, but this book is the perfect assistant in helping an aspiring artist to bring to reality those images that only exist in one's mind. It's a wealth of information that comes from his experience and from many artists of the past. Also, it can be appreciated by both beginners and accomplished artists.
B002LB8U26|5.0|Nicolas Cage gives a wonderful performance as Seth, an Angel who falls in love and begins to long for the ability to express that love, in a film that in some respects resembles the 1930's film \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" with Fredric March and Evelyn Veneble. Seth's assignment as an angel is to help the dead cross over in this quasi remake of the Wim Wenders foreign film, \\"Wings of Desire.\\" Few films since the glory days of Hollywood and the old studio system have been given the romantic glow of this film.<br /><br />Meg Ryan is Maggie, the heart surgeon who is the object of Seth's affection. He is stunned when she somehow senses his prescence when trying to save one of her patients, and is touched and bewildered by her. Andre Braugher steals every scene he is in as Seth's fellow Angel and friend. They all hang out at the library and gather every morning at the beach to see the sunrise and hear the singing of heaven.<br /><br />Dennis Franz has a fine turn as a patient in Maggie's hospital who knows Seth is there because he too was once an Angel. As Seth and he become friends, Seth contemplates how wonderful it would be to truly love Maggie, and searches for the courage to leave heaven behind and, simply fall.<br /><br />This is one of the most romantic movies to come out of Hollywood in decades and has a message about the wonderful things we all take for granted. More than that, it is a story about the importance of love, even one felt for only a moment, for it is that experience which makes us special among all creation. To love is all, and to be loved in return is truly divine.<br /><br />There are some memorable scenes in this romantic and haunting film. One involves the simple act of shopping for fruit at a farmer's market. Another involves Maggie being able to feel Seth in her room but unable to see him. Even Hemingway's Moveable Feast plays a part in this magical throwback film to a bygone era. This is very much a film which could just as easily have been made in the 1930's.<br /><br />I will not ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human. This film is for anyone who has ever loved someone as Seth does, who would trade all eternity for just one breath of her hair. If you have ever loved someone so much your heart ached when they were not with you, then you will be deeply moved by this film. It is painted in broad romantic brushstrokes and colored in rich oils not easily removed from our hearts. This is a truly memorable film you will watch over and over.<br /><br />Films like this are rarely made anymore and this is one to cherish. You will never forget the line: \\"When they ask me what I liked best...I'll say it was you.\\"ruin the last portion of this film if you have not seen it, but as we all know there is a price we pay for being human.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|I knew the guys would come out with a kick ass album with or without Jimmy. But i was scared that they would have went a wall without their bestfriend. I guessed wrong, the boys helped live on Jimmy, and theirselves with this album. Nightmare deffently isnt Avenged's best album, but it made an impact on me when i first heard it. And obviously it ment something to other people when it made it to #1 on every music chart. If you even like one song from Avenged, i say buy this album. It is worth it. I hated heavy metal & rock until i heard avenged sevenfold in 2008(thank you very much guitar hero:D) they brought me into all the amazing bands today (three days grace, linkin park, dream theater, iron maden, b4mv ect.) and Nightmare is deffently worth buying
0723247609|5.0|I love this book. It has all of the Beatrix Potter tales I know and many more that I had never heard. The stories are cute, funny, great vocabulary builders and teach valuable lessons. Some of the names of the characters are surprisingly silly (i.e. a mouse named Hunca Munca). My 2 year old and 4 year old daughters really enjoy it. This should be a part of any child's library.
B001GKYBXA|1.0|McCartney's biggest problem is his intensive competitiveness that keeps him from thinking clearly, which has only gotten worse starting with \\"Give My Regards To Broadstreet\\". At least in the 1970's he was trying to beat John, George, and in a way Ringo. Today he has no more competition and instead of enjoying his billion plus dollars in the bank or worth, he keeps making forgettable and disposable albums. While George made some good and some awful albums in the 1970's, by early 1983 he was done making records, later devoting his energies to being in the company of other great musicians in the \\"Traveling Wilburys\\", Ringo with his \\"All Starr Band\\". With John gone, Denny Laine alienated, and a lot of talented studio and touring musicians disappointed and cheated - his albums consisted of an ever changing backing group. Even George Martin gave up after couple of albums in the 1980's. The result was a long string of crappy albums, each worse than the predecessor, and in his personal life, still chasing after women younger than his daughters, one of whom had an even bigger ego and rightly so, got some of his millions - barely a drop in his personal fortune. Sir Paul's stinginess and cheapskate personality has been the stuff of legend, the fodder of many biographies, and vouched by many musicians who had the misfortune of being sucked dry and financially cheated by this petulant and plastic souled man. The 2001 track \\"Freedom\\" was a total embarrassment from a man who made his billions by being ambiguous and cold in his career of creating poppy, saccharine songs. Frankly, he should take his millions and keep smoking his dope for the rest of his years, but he should be banned from releasing anything anymore. This may be the reason why he's about to beat Ringo in the number of labels he's been recording for, as his material is as irrelevant as his ego for this past couple of decades. The old man should hang it up now. He's become a parody of a parody of his past self now. Sad, disappointing, un-filling, and pathetic.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|The movie is great, but the DVD is lacking. Warner brothers promised that the dvd release would include in it the opening of deathly hallows part 2. It doesnt. it contains only four of the promised deleted scenes, and is missing all the other promised material.     luckily, the price was low, but WB needs to make the opening sequence avalible for DVD people, because they promised us that feature, and not everyone can afford to keep dropping hundreds of bucks to buy blu ray players, and whatever format will replace it.    it may be a small promise, but the opening of part two was a promise, nonetheless.
B0014GJMA8|5.0|Rarely has a film of such extraordinary visual beauty reached the profound emotional depths of this magnificently acted period film from Iain Softley. Based on the novel by Henry James, cinematographer Eduardo Serra sets a table of beauty and elegance while screenwriter Houssein Amini serves up dishes of love, passion and desire, all arranged in their proper order by director Softley, creating an unforgettable dining experience.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is Kate, a passionate beauty in love with Martin (Linus Roache), a man without money. Charlotte Rampling is her rich aunt, who may force her to marry well, but not for love. Kate has a fire burning beneath her dark beauty, however, and when fate gives her an opportunity to show Martin how she loves, a dangerous journey down winding currents is begun, and neither she nor Martin will be prepared for what awaits them at the river's end.<br /><br />Alison Elliot is simply marvelous as Millie, her finest role since \\"The Spitfire Grill.\\" Millie is a charming American girl of great wealth reaching out to touch life before it passes by. She and Kate will become fast and inseparable friends, but Millie's attraction to Martin and a secret discovered by Kate will set in tenuous motion a plan to solve all their problems. When the maneuvering of lives like chess pieces involves both the human heart and someone as special as Millie, however, unforseen complications can arise.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter may have received all the nominations as the beautiful and passionate Kate, but Alison Elliot's portrayel of the sweet and open Millie, rich but lonely, and desparate for love, deserved an Oscar and Golden Globe nomination as well. Italy is beautifully recreated from the period in a film of both depth and beauty.<br /><br />This film is a true cinematic masterpiece. A gratuitous scene with Carter near the end of this film seems out of place, but can not detract from its beauty. I highly recommend picking this one up in a regular DVD format, rather than a disposable one, as it is a film worth keeping. Fine Italian lace is gently lifted back to reveal an emotionally naked look at the human heart. It is substance with beauty and beauty with substance, and is not to be missed.than a disposable one, as it is a film worth keeping.

0307271862|1.0|I found myself re-reading through the book to try and understand the jump from the US story involving Chinese slaves, and the motive for the murder of 19 people in Sweden.  There were also some glaring inconsistencies: the hotelier tells Brigitta that the man on the cctv has turned up again - but it wasn't the same one!  Also would a intelligent woman being pursued by a murderer write down the destination she was fleeing to? And London is a big place!!
B001R4MEUM|5.0|This is where Genesis takes music where it has never been before. It was tried by the likes of the Who in Quadraphenia and Tommy. However it is Genesis that uses the vehicle of the story of Rael to create a musical theme that showcases the skills of the whole band in a way that has not happened since. One piece skillfully moves from one scene to the next yet at the same time featuring Collins at his best utlizing sounds that creates one mood after another working as a foil to Rutherford's guitrs, Banks keyboards and Hackett's guitars and of course Gabriel's vocals. There probably was no where to go further than this at least we'll never know. This piece certainly stands as a monuement in their career. This performance live was at just the right time in their career before the rest of the world finally took note of them. This was an album that needed to be performed in the setting most of us were used to seeing Genesis in the intimate setting of the theatre not the stadium's of football soccer and baseball.

0553573411|5.0|\\"He's hurt. What possible damage can it do for me to at least look at his injuries. You can hang him whole as easily as you can wounded, can't you?\\"    This book is set in a world that has medieval technology and is riddled with \\"skill\\" or \\"wit\\" users, types of magic that are found throughout the world. This is the second book of the series, and at the end the first, Fitzchivalry, the main character, also the bastard of the deceased prince Chivalry, comes back to his homeland ill and  sick after prince regal has poisoned him. His employment to king Shrewd lets him see how court life happens and he soon becomes friends with king-in-waiting Verity. This is an action and adventure story that can be a lot of fun and exciting.     I really enjoyed this book. One very interesting thing is that every chapter starts with an approximately one page of a story that pertains to the chapter and gives connections, but doesn't give anything away about what will happen. Here is a quote from one of those. \\"The Pocked man at your window, The Pocked man at your door, The pocked man bring the plague days, To stretch you o the floor.\\" This was a rhyme that it said. The chapter than had to do with how the pocked man came to be, and this helped the main character and his friends. Another good thing is the character development. The author gives insightful details about how characters react to things, how and why. The book kept me reading because there was always one large problem to be solved, and other small ones along the way. The main problem with this book was it sometimes became slow and it sometimes took a long time to reach a resolution to a problem. One thing that I found was I could draw connections to other things I already knew from other areas. For example, some of the countries bore a strong resemblance to other countries that were real in medieval times.
0061801313|4.0|\\"Never trust a pretty girl with an ugly secret! (Pg.16)\\" In the novel Pretty Little Liars, written by Sara Shepard five best friends Allison DiLaurentis, Aria Montgomery, Emily Fields, Hanna Marin, and Spencer Hastings face a tragedy one night that changes their lives. During the beginning of this novel the \\"top dog\\" of this clique Allison DiLaurentis decides to throw her annual sleepover. Allison DiLaurentis I feel is a bad example for the other four girls, by making them do and say bad things. An example of this is Allison sneaks in alcohol into their sleepover and the next morning Allison DiLaurentis goes missing. A year after that day the now four girls who used to be inseparable barley even make eye contact. On Allison DiLaurentis's birthday night a discovery will bring the four girl together again and closer then ever.<br />This novel is a murder mystery that keeps you hanging on until the end. I enjoyed this novel more then I thought I was going to. I believe that it can be scary for young kids but for teenagers especially it is a fun and suspenseful read. I loved how the author wrote the quote, \\"This is no longer a missing child, but a murder. (Pg. 67)\\" This quote explains what the novel is based on and I think that it is extremely important in this novel. The novel is not a hard read but an enjoyable one. I enjoyed how the author wrote all of the cliffhangers at the end of the chapters, and especially the one at the end of the novel. Since I have now finished the first of this series I definitely want to read the next book and I hope to enjoy it as much as I did this novel, Pretty Little Liars by Sara Shepard.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|I liked it, but did not love it (like I did the first book.) I liked that the story was written in Adam's perspective, but I missed having Mia's perspective.<br />My main issue with the book was all of the stories about the past. While I like to find out things about the characters, I didn't like how the story flowed (or didn't, in this case.) It seemed like after every chapter, there was a flashback. It killed the momentum.

B004R13U6Y|3.0|I like the UI better in ezPDF vs. Adobe Reader (free), but one thing that bothered me too much is that the fonts are not as clear in ezPDF. I compared a few PDFs in both Adobe and ezPDF, and Adobe rendered fonts more clearly on each document. Fonts are still readable and you can zoom in for more clarity. But it just bugged me too much, and since I don't need the annotation capability, I'm going back to using Adobe. PDFs loaded in about the same amount of time.
B004UOE7VA|1.0|I have to say, I was pretty thrilled when I saw that this album had been released.  I don't keep up with music news, so I was surprised when I saw this at the store and without listening to the sample tracks, bought it through my phone.  Overall I wish I had been more patient, because I'm more than a bit disappointed.  My excitement faded almost instantly and grudgingly sat through the entire album, my hopes fading with each track.  There was only a track or two that I didn't think were absolutely horrid, but in the long run, there isn't a single track that I would have purchased on its own.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people had misconceptions about the main Tron Legacy soundtrack because they were expecting more of Daft Punk's classic style(despite that not being the point of it), and many people had a lot of hope when it came to this album being different from how the original was.  Well they achieved that all right, just not in what anyone was looking for.  Yes, there are a lot of big names here, but honestly I can't try to figure out what it was that they were trying to accomplish.  From my standpoint, there was plenty that they could have done with the score, but it falls flat from everything I've seen.<br /><br />In the end, I'm more than sorely disappointed with this album.  Unless you are absolute die-hard fans of the artists listed, and have to have everything that they've done, I don't advise the purchase of this product.  Please listen to the sample tracks, its not what you're expecting.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I'm still crazy about it after all these years.  The DVD extras are extraordinary!  The TV special was amazing.  The Smothers Brothers could get away with so much (but they had their censor problems, too), yet looking back on this show, I could't find much that I'd have been offended by. But then I was never offended by the Smothers boys either.  The look back at the making of the album and the TV special was totally enlightening. You can talk all you want about the drugs and the unrest, but the sixties was just such a fertile time for music, and was beginning to become the same for movies too.  There were so many absolutely brilliant albums, they keep you listening and marvelling continually for all this time.  I don't think any other period in musical history could compare.  BOTW is right up there among the best.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I Love, Love this movie so we purchased it. Great cast and all bringing in A+ performances. The script was well written and made more interesting by adding back stories along the way for the Agents. Very well done movie although very heavy with all the sometimes too much action and shooting overkill. But despite that I felt this movie had more depth than I expected to the storyline which was a very nice surprise. Love the laughs along the way and the mood of the movie was just good fun. Loved seeing the \\"older\\" Characters showing they still had what it took to do the job and then some in the movie. Very clever script. This is a keeper.

B004N66XYE|5.0|This DVD is the first season of the new Upstairs, Downstairs.  It is only 3 hours long, which, frankly, does not justify the price being charged.  Despite this, I would like to note: (i) I enjoyed the series very much; (ii) I cried at the end of the third episode; (iii) Eileen Atkins' character is great; (iv) the DVD appears to contain the full BBC version of the series (not the stripped down PBS version sans 30 minutes); and (v) next year there will be six more episodes.  I hope that PBS shows all of them next year, and does not hold some back for the following year (which was the case for Poirot and Miss Marple).  Personally, I would hold off buying the DVD until the price comes down.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|If I could, I would rate this concert 10 stars!  Cameron MacKintosh, the cast, the orchestra, the singers, et al, have made this another stunning production.

Thanks to my dad, I first saw Les Miserables with the original Broadway cast in 1987. I've been hooked ever since.  BTW, I still LOVE the 10th anniversary production.  Long live Les Miserables!
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Filmed during the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 Heures du Mans) this, in my opinion, is the finest racing movie yet made. No CGI here, the filming is incredible, and you forget you are watching a movie, its more of a documentary. Steve McQueen was a racing enthusiast. He raced cars and motorcycles, concentrating on endurance racing. He raced in the 1970 12 Hours of Sebring, a race early in the season that teams use to prepare for Le Mans. McQueen and his racing partner Peter Revson, in McQueen's V8 powered Porsche almost won Sebring. It took Mario Andretti borrowing a V12 Ferrari ( his car he had been leading the race had broke down), to beat McQueen at the end of the race by only 22 seconds. McQueen impressed everyone especially since he was racing with a broken left foot and a cast on! Many think that McQueen would have won with a car that was more competitive against the V12 Ferrari Andretti used to win. That experience shows at Le Mans, a race that is not only about speed, its about endurance as Ferrari and Porsche battle to win the world's most prestigious car race. My late father took me to this movie when I was a wide eyed second grader. It was an experience I have never forgot. If you are into racing, Le Mans is a must see. If you aren't into racing, you may find yourself interested in it after watching Le Mans. Either way, its a ground breaking classic combining a real event with a major motion picture.<br /><br />The audio and picture quality are excellent for a 40 year old movie. The featurette has McQueen's son along with one of the stunt drivers, second director and production staff telling stories about the filming.<br /><br />The initial copies include a $7 Jiffy Lube coupon.

B003405MF6|5.0|Jeff Beck have a command of his instrument that is second to none.  His abilitly to create sounds from his quitar is remarkable.  As shown by this album and the vast majority of his albums over the lst forty some years, it comes down to song suggestions. Instead of going the route of his Yardbirds friends, Clapton and Page, and create music for the masses, he followed the Neil Young trail and create albums for himself, giving little thoughts to the concept is this sellable. make Zepplin, Cream and the other monster quitar bands is the mixture of the band members together to form something special.  For Jeff Beck,it always been about standing alone on center stage, with a recorder turned out and letting go of a endless string of increable riffs, until the tape runs out.     I do own the majority material of his albums, to show how much of a fan I am, and this is his best album since \\"Wired\\".  I also understand that the market for Mr Beck and his albums is slim and there will be a lot of people that will get bored and goes what the point.  What It all about your taste and what you are looking for.

0545123275|3.0|This book could have been wonderful. I enjoyed reading it and it appeared that it was going to have a very meloncholy ending, but there was an extra chapter thrown in. And by thrown in I mean it really appeared as though the story was done but in an effort to turn a wonderful stand alone novel into a series (and make more money) another chapter is added where the main characters love interest isnt really dead so its all happy happy. I personally dont have a problem with sad endings. Some stories are much better for their bittersweet endings and this book really would have been better had it not added the extra chapter at the end.

0316056863|5.0|I loved this without reservation.  Tina Fey is snarky, earthy, self-deprecating, funny and extremely good at cutting to the bone of various social maladies.  Her biography epitomizes this.  I laughed out loud several times, sometimes while cringing in sympathy.  (I think I sprained something in that last maneuver.)  If you like 30 Rock, you'll like this.

B00005JLKN|5.0|Under normal circumstances I would Say stick to the original!!! The first draft is usually the best. It gets the ideas out there better, it has the best representation of the story, it has more nostalgia value.  In this case It is a bit of a hung jury.  I very much enjoyed Manhunter, the casting was excellent, and the locations and sets, as well as the mood and imagery were all top notch. However it was a bootleg, changing spellings and such to keep royalties out of the hands of the original author. Also not enough Lecter (Lektor).    This remake is just as good in the casting shooting and tone department, but is miles ahead in production value and Hannibal content. I deeply enjoy the small nods they add throughout towards the films that were made before but take place after this one. Seeing as the last two films that were made (Red Dragon, Hanninbal Rising) were shot after the others but both take place before, they have the distinct virtue of relying on the cannon already out there.     All together this is a wonderful film, and will fit into the preexisting cannon already in your collections. I say watch and enjoy, but don't forget the original.

Torchwood is a BBC spin-off of very longtime running Doctor Who. BBC claims mixed review and finally high budget cost lead to the off again on again series till Torchwood was cancelled in 2009. Torchwood creators believing in the series searched for another buyer. In 2010 cable channel \\"Staz\\" announced they would pick up \\"Torchwood.\\" John Barrowman and Eve Myles recreate their role in a new series titled, \\"Torchwood: Miracle Day.\\" The first of 10 episodes will premier July 8, 2011 on Starz HD. With exceptional original programming such as Spartacus, Camelot, and Pillars of the Earth, Torchwood should be spectacular because of Starz standards for high end programming. Torchwood: Miracle Day adds a new cast member starting Bill Pullman (Independence Day and Sleepless in Seattle.) The Torchwood series will not disappoint sci fi lovers. My rating is 5 potato 6 potato.
0793563836|5.0|Before I purchased this \\"collected volume,\\" I was worried that I'd be getting the first edition. Surely, it couldn't POSSIBLY be the 2nd edition books + the CDs for that superb price!  After all, if you buy them separately, the cost is nearly triple what this collected volume costs. Well, I am pleasantly surprised and happy to admit I was wrong!<br /><br />These ARE the new 2nd edition books in this collected volume, AND all 3 CDs are included.  This is an astounding price point for such quality material.<br /><br />I took lessons years ago when I was in high school and every kid wanted to start a rock band (yay for the 80s?) Cue the rest of my life taking some twists and turns, moving across country with no room in the truck to take my bass... hopefully you can see where I'm going with this.<br /><br />After years of being away, I decided to get back into my bass playing, encouraged by fellow musicians I met at my day job. I knew I'd be out of practice and would need to get back up to where I used to be, so I decided to get a good method book to give myself a solid new foundation upon which to flourish (I also got myself a new bass, but that's a review for another time).<br /><br />This book is top notch, and a lot of the fundamentals in here I remember my music teacher telling me during my weekly private lessons at the local mom and pop music shop. Additionally, the sheet music examples include both the traditional inscription as well as tablature, which helps when trying to learn to read music.<br /><br />If you are a rank beginner, this book is right up your alley. You can start from square one, and by the time you're done, you'll have a good foundation upon which to build. If you're not exactly brand new to the instrument, the books are still helpful as they get more intricate and advanced as the volume numbers increase. At the very least, there's good reference material in here and for the price, you just can't beat it.<br /><br />I decided to start from the beginning even though I'd consider myself intermediate.  After so long away, I wanted to break it down to bare basics and make sure I was disciplined enough to know the material in my sleep... something I wasn't exactly all that keen on as a teenager. ;) So far, I'm having a blast... I'd almost forgotten what joy I get from playing.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough!diate.

1572816112|5.0|I love these cards. One of my first tarot decks (the darker imagery appealed to me). All of the art is beautiful, and the symbols are easy to remember for most of the cards. With only a few weeks of owning these cards I have found myself doing more and more personal readings with them.     If you're not a fan of the preview artwork, you won't like the whole deck, but if you like the cover (and any images you can find online) then don't hesitate to pick this deck up. It is an 'oversized' deck, making it hard for some to shuffle, but I've found no problems after a little bit of time with them. The cards are thick, durable, and will definitely outlast decks that are made with less quality in mind.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|I've tried this application as well as Adobe Reader, QuickOffice, and QuickOffice HD and the last two are the best of them all. ezPDF is just WAY TOO SLOW!! Adobe's isn't very fast either, but the last two are reasonibly fast. I tested all four on a 1.5 Mb Hurricane Evacuation Route PDF which has a lot of color and detail and the ezPDF's load time and refresh was just unacceptible. I am running a dual core processor and it shouldn't take any of them very long to render. If cost is a factor, I would use Adobe's over this one.

0385341679|5.0|It starts off with the grief that was missing from Darkfever (book 1) in which Mac is only two weeks into searching for her sister Alina's murderer (although she did make it a point to note that Mac doesn't really remember anything from those first weeks). It was powerful and heart wrenching and made me feel Mac's new drive rather than simply understand it. Now she doesn't just want to stop the bad guys and stop the Walls from crashing down, although they already have (book 4), Mac wants the book for herself and we see her change in her grief and desire to essentially change the past.<br /><br />But the book gets back on track, fans, don't freak. I don't want to tell you anything too specific but Moning does wrap up Mac's story arc in a way feels resolved. Those questions about who killed Alina and how Mac fits into this crazy world of Fae and fallen walls get answered but Moning's world is full enough that Mac's adventures won't stop once the book is closed. Which brings us to Dani. At the time I originally reviewed the book I was unsure whether Moning would continue from her perspective in a new series. For those interested, check out Moning's most recent book, Iced. Keep in mind though, that Dani's story picks up from the end of Shadowfever and so it is a 14 year old protagonist for an adult urban fantasy series. Those who hated Dani's voice should stop at Shadowfever.<br /><br />As for Mac, I should note that she has developed wonderfully throughout the books, and it does not stop here. We get to see so many sides of Mac in this book: strong, vulnerable, loving, grieving, sociopathic, but most of all, evolved. She has gone through one trial of fire after another but in the end she makes it out.<br /><br />The way Ms. Moning has crafted her books takes the readers on a journey, and it's a single-story series in the way that Ilona Andrew's Kate Daniels is: one massive conflict and a bunch of others leading up to it, taking the reader on so many twists and turns and developing the characters so well that we actually care what happens to them, while managing some surprises along the way.<br /><br />Read it, listen to it, buy it, just be sure not to miss the final installment of Karen Marie Moning's Fever series.

1586487981|5.0|Although I am an economist by training and have studied economics for many years, I admit that in reading this book I have learned a great deal about the complexities of both the theory and the practice of anti-poverty policies in developing nations.    Why are people so interested in the issue of global poverty?  Well, to list a few of the many aspects about poverty addressed in this book, every year about 9 million children die before they reach their fifth birthday, usually in the poorest countries.  In the developed world, a woman has a one-in-5,000 chance of dying while giving birth, but in many sub-Saharan Africa countries the odds are one-in-30.  There are at least 25 countries in the world with life expectancies of 55 years or less.  If these sorts of situations capture your mind and lead it to ask what can be done, one of the first things you might consider doing is learning more about the conditions and circumstances that lead to these revealing statistics.  That's where this book comes in.    So, is this book one you should buy?  Presumably that's why you are reading this.  Here are a few observations that may help you decide whether to buy this fine book:  In the authors' own words, the book \\"is ultimately about what the lives and choices of the poor tell us about how to fight global poverty.\\"  That may not sound too sexy or exciting, but if you have an interest in facts, theories and observations about global poverty, then this is your book.  On the other hand, if what you seek are simple theories and, especially, strong advocacy of a few preferred solutions, then you are probably barking up the wrong tree.  Don't get me wrong; I like the book just as it is.  There is so much information to consider and so many approaches to fighting poverty to contemplate.  Just don't expect the authors to take a lot of your time championing pet solutions.  Because the problem of poverty is itself rather complex, so are some of its solutions.  Jack Webb (the \\"just thefacts, ma'am\\" star of the \\"Dragnet\\" series) might have loved this fact-filled book.  At least, he'd love it if he was an economist or someone interested in learning (a lot) about global poverty.  Yet there's much more to the book that mere facts.  Primarily, there is a pursuit of understanding the circumstances associated with poverty and the efforts to overcome it.  That's where this book excels.    It's certainly early to judge, but this book could prove to be a classic in its field.  It successfully challenges and encourages the reader to think in new ways about anti-poverty initiatives.  Although its authors are probably unknown to the general public, they are well regarded in economics.  They both have received a number of prestigious awards, including the John Bates Clark Medal (to Esther Duflo) for the best American economist under age 40.  Previous winners of this award include a Who's Who of economists, such as Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman, James Tobin, Kenneth Arrow, Gary Becker, Martin Feldstein, Lawrence Summers and Steven Levitt.    In short, this is a substantial book with a great deal of important content.  There are some graphs, but less than you might expect from two economists.  Importantly, it is readable and understandable by the interested lay reader.  Frankly, I think it's a book you won't forget.  If the issues of global poverty and economic development interest you, this is a book well worth your careful consideration.
1423113381|5.0|What would happen if you found out you were related to pharaohs and gods? Carter and Sadie, two siblings, find out after their father tries to summon their dead mother by using Egyptian magic. They never knew about their family's magical past, so they are quite shocked. While in London, their father released an evil Egyptian god, Set, who killed him. After that, the children are sent to New York, and then to Egypt. They begin their magic training, and learn more about their mystical family. As they begin to learn magic, Carter and Sadie realize that they are very powerful, and seen as a threat by some others. Sadie and Carter want to battle Set, so they can defeat him and get their father back.   This book is great, I really enjoyed reading it. Riordan wrote the book from Carter and Sadie's point of view. They were constantly switching off narrating, and they were telling the story from the future, so you are always wondering where they are. Each time Carter and Sadie switch you can see the change in personality and language. Sadie is 12 and Carter is 14, so there's clearly a difference in attitude. The way they are described is also very well done. Sadie is shown as a girl with red streaks in her messy hair, and she wears combat boots. Carter, on the other hand, is described as very neat and clean, he also isn't quite as \\"confident\\" as Sadie. Carter and Sadie are basically opposites, but they still make a really good team, even though Sadie is constantly teasing Carter.   If you enjoyed the Lightning Thief and the rest of that series, you would definitely like this book. It has the same concept, Percy, Carter, and Sadie all find out that Egyptian Gods, or Greek Myths, are actually real, and that they have a connection to them. You would also like this book if you like fantasy, or adventures. I would definitely suggest this book to anyone.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|This movie is such a super-collided atomic mess that it is hard to rate \\"Splice\\" with just a single star for how endearingly awful it is; and for that reason, it's almost tempting to give it five stars for being such a stunning screw-up. Obviously, someone had high-hopes for \\"Splice;\\" by casting Oscar winner Adrian Brody and handing it to up and coming director Vincenzo Natali (best known for cult science-fiction classic \\"The Cube\\"), \\"Splice\\" had a high concept and old fashioned B-Movie science fiction plot going for it. Brody and co-star Sarah Polley are the scientists who decide to ignore all the rules and go against those stuffy conventions that they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted. The bad news is: they get the scientific breakthrough they wanted.<br /><br />Yes, that's right. These ever so hip scientists (Brody wanders the lab with ironic t-shirts, there's Anime artwork in the couple's apartment) are genius DNA specialists that somehow match human DNA with amphibians, scorpions, birds and who knows what else to create Dren, which happens to be Nerd spelled backward. Like most science fiction monsters, Dren grows at a ridiculously fast pace, has super-human intelligence, childlike behavior and not much by way of moral turpitude. Of course, Brody and Polley soon lose all scientific objectivity regarding Dren and fall in love with their little monster, and that's when things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />While this might seem like boiler-plate science-fiction, \\"Splice\\" may be the first hipster Science Fiction movie. The best sci-fi/suspense/horror works when your monster somehow is an allegory for whatever the zeitgeist of the world is at the moment. \\"Splice\\" works that angle in that \\"Dren\\" begs us to consider what nasty creatures we may create if we start messing with Mother Nature, but soon starts going for new levels of irony. Before you know it, \\"Splice\\" is whipping questions of gender identity, circumcision, lust, love, parenting, rape and finally, the usual evil corporation profit mongers. With ever upping of the ante, as a viewer, you're left to wonder \\"did they really just go there?\\" The answer is yes, and the film just keeps on going. The final third of the movie is such a mess that you feel like you're watching the train wreck. It's not wretchedly bad (for that, you need \\"Alien Vs Predator\\" or \\"Battlefield Earth\\"), but \\"Splice\\" - which borrows so much from the likes of \\"Species,\\" \\"Alien,\\" \\"Prophecy\\" and even \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" that you may feel a bit of deja vu - will still leave you stunned.corporation profit mongers.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games opens in an unrecognizable America.  Years of devastating natural disasters have ravaged the land and left its people terrified and fighting for survival.  From that desperate chaos emerges a new government in which safety is offered in return for total submission.  Citizens of the Capitol enjoy the power and luxury of the ruling class, while inhabitants of the twelve districts under their dominion toil on the brink of starvation without complaint (if they know what's good for them).  The Capitol demands tribute from each district as penance for a past revolution attempt:  One boy and one girl to be thrown into an arena for a fight to the death, televised for national entertainment.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen of District 12 finds herself an unlucky tribute.  We follow her as she comes to grips with the terrible unfairness of her situation and decides if and how she should fight back.    As a social studies teacher, my mind was whirring with the possible applications of this text in my classroom (although I'd like to note that the novel is an exciting read regardless of occupation or age--I read the entire series in a weekend, unable to put it down!).  The themes explored in this book align perfectly with the Participation in Government curriculum of New York State, and I'm sure the same is true of other curricula and other states.      It is normal for American youths to take their government for granted, to feel entitled to their freedoms and opportunities without examining the whys and hows of their privilege (and this goes for adults too!).  In order to encourage participation in government, students must examine government's purpose, origins, and operation.  I am frequently met with apathy and complacency on this front.  Concepts that are difficult for adolescents to grasp--ideas like Rousseau's social contract, Locke's natural rights, and the consent of the governed--can seem intangible and insignificant to the American teenager.  Katniss's fictional story offers adolescents a window into a world that is very real for people in other nations today.  When students view the concepts above through Katniss's eyes, engrossed in her heart-pounding struggle for survival, they become real and significant.  Students will feel Katniss's despair at being a second-class citizen.  They will share her angry and righteous desire to bring about the destruction of the oppressive Capitol.  And, with teacher guidance, they will expand their thinking about Katniss's government to think about their own world.    The Hunger Games is a novel that enthralls readers as much as any blockbuster action movie, but it also offers an opportunity to provoke serious and impassioned academic discussion.  Due to its broad appeal and its sophisticated themes, it is a must-read for any government class.

0307408833|5.0|I am not gluten intolerant and don't have allergies. I wanted to have healthier sweets without having to eat chemicals and sacrifice flavor.  I'm so glad Erin developed these incredible recipes and wrote this cookbook.    I'm an excellent cook and baker, but all non-vegan. Vegan baking is a whole nuther ball game.  I tried 3 recipes so far and all have been wonderful, even when I messed up.  The first thing I baked was the vanilla cupcakes and accompanying vanilla frosting.  I used the Bob's Gluten Free All Purpose Flour instead of the Garbanzo Bean/Fava Bean Flour that the recipe clearly called for.  The mix was so dry I added water and I pretty much doomed the cupcakes.  They fell and I sliced what I produced into thin slices and re-baked the slices into a cookie type thing.  The flavor was really good. The frosting was terrific.  I was enjoying it with the \\"cookies\\" made out of the botched cupcakes, and my grown kids came over and finished the vanilla frosting in one sitting.    Everyone who tasted it raved about the flavors.       Next I made the double chocolate chocolate chip cookies. I followed the recipe and have the most delicious cookies. They don't taste the least bit funny, even though they are gluten free.  They are perfectly salted, perfectly full of chocolate, richly decadent, and the texture is perfect cookie.  All friends and family are so impressed.  No one can tell they are vegan at all. They are fantastic.    Babycakes' cookbook uses soymilk and soymilk powder for the frosting, while on Martha Stewart's show and at her bakeries, the recipe is soy free and uses rice milk and rice milk powder.  If it can be easily found, use the rice milk and rice milk powder like Erin showed on the Martha Stewart show.  It works either way. I think she may have used the soy in the book as it's easier to find than the Rice Milk Powder.     Be forewarned, the ingredients are much more expensive than flour and sugar, but the high quality ingredients make this stuff taste so good.  Nothing tastes funny or beany.  The gluten free flours she uses do have beans in them, but beans are very starchy and bland anyhow.  In savory recipes, beans are seasoned alot to get them to have flavor.  Neither I nor anyone in my family tastes beans in these desserts and I follow the recipes exactly. The ingredients are excellent and tasty.    About the vanilla frosting, I had no problem with it setting up. Erin makes it very clear in the book that the Vanilla Sauce/Frosting is a sauce until it chilled for 6 hours.  I made it and stuck it in the refrigerator overnight.  It was set after that.  It needs to be chilled. I believe the problems with it setting up for other reviewers are from not letting the frosting chill overnight with the refrigerator door closed.  Opening and closing the door during the day is not going to let that frosting set.      One problem in the book is that there is no mention of using melted coconut oil in her recipes, and the recipes need MELTED COCONUT OIL.  Why that's not mentioned on each recipe or in the book, I have no idea.  Also, I didn't have a melon baller, and I've never owned a melon baller. She says to use the melon baller to measure the cookie dough for the Double Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookies. I made the Chocolate Chocolate cookies by rolling the dough in to little balls and then she says to smash the cookie dough down.  I smashed it quite a bit, and the cookies didn't flatten like they did in the picture in the book. I smashed more on the rest of the cookies.  Her recipes make big batches. All the batches of cookies were delicious.      I recommend this book to any good cook who wants to eat better sweets that are just as delicious as the butter, eggs, cream, and sugar stuff many of us love.  The bonus is that it's so much better for you.  I love it and I'm so grateful to Erin for sharing her recipes and for developing them in the first place.  I am loving Vegan Baking and I'm brand new at it.  I can make wonderful wonderful things and don't feel guilty at all eating them or sharing them with my friends and family.  In fact, I feel wonderful feeding these desserts to people.    I had a friend who worked on a bake sale at our town's University and she brought me home a vegan cookie.  Yuck.  I'm actually a little resentful that no one goes to the trouble that I and Erin do to get it right.  I never get as good as I give (because my food is fantastic).  I set the bar very high. I'm a huge fan of Maida Heatter.  This stuff meets that bar.

0316056863|5.0|In terms of providing a helpful review, I think there's really only one thing you need to know: If you like Tina Fey's humor, you will like this book, if not, you probably won't. Almost every line is played for laughs. When it's not, it's setting up a laugh. Which is not to say that it's not a 'true' memoir - every chapter is oriented around a life experience or theme (not in an absolutely linear way, but close.) But the insights, even the deep ones - and there are some - are communicated in a laugh-out-loud, Tina Fey kind of way. Personally I loved it, and read it in a day.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned a certain distance, and I think that is true - I think it's a product of her kind of humor. It requires a distance, a dispassionate eye. But this did not bother me in the slightest - her 'job' is to make us laugh, and she did that. And I respect her right to NOT bare her soul (or anything else) to the public (and I can think of more than a few other celebrities that might want to consider trying it...) I felt that there were many true poignant moments, between the laughs, or even better, coinciding with them, particularly when she talked about her daughter, being a working mom, and her struggle to decide whether or not to have another child.<br /><br />In fact, all the funniest and deepest felt bits for me were related to insights on being a woman in today's world - in the workplace, as a working mom, a female comedian, as a public figure. So in that sense, it is something of a 'woman's book.' Although I'm giving it to my husband next, as he loves 30 Rock too, so we'll see how it plays with the male demographic in my household...<br /><br />My only critique would be the title - not sure why it's called Bossypants? She does have a fair bit on being the boss of 30 Rock, and even a semi-faux chapter on her boss/leadership advice, but to me it's not the main theme of the book, so don't be thrown off by that.
B003JTHSE0|3.0|Slumdog Millionaire formerly published as Q&A by Vikas Swarup    The movie Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Danny Boyle, went on to win 8 Oscars, including best picture.  It also won Best Adapted Screenplay, from the novel Slumdog Millionaire by Vikas Swarup, which had previously been published as Q&A.    Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Ram Muhammad Thomas, who won a billion rupees on one of India's biggest game shows and was subsequently arrested on charges of cheating.  The game show doesn't want to pay Ram the full amount, and since he is an uneducated man, they figure the only way he could've won is by cheating.  With the help of Smita Shah, a lawyer who takes on Ram's case, Ram hopes to show how his life experiences helped provide him with the answers to the question and that he did not cheat.    For those of you who have watched the movie, you have already noticed one very large difference between what I just wrote above and what you saw in the movie: the main character's name.  I have no idea why they changed the lead's name.  It's been a couple years since I watched the movie, so this review of the book isn't meant to examine the transition from book to screen.    Each chapter covers a different question on the game show, and how Ram knew the answer.  We watch as he enjoys his childhood with his best friend Salim, being adopted by a Priest, falling in love, being forced away from the one he loves, and through many other tales.  Though these, we not only discover how Ram knows the answer to the questions on the game show, but we also learn about him, as his character deepens with each question.    Some of these chapters are excellent.  Each contains its own smaller narrative, largely kept within the confines of the chapter.  Some of the narratives trickle into other stories, especially those involving Salim or death of some kind.  However, there are a couple chapters which are weaker.  These are often the chapters where, merely from reading the events,I can immediately see what Ram learns that will be applicable to the game show.  Also, some of the plot lines never seem to be brought to adequate conclusion.  When I finished the book, my first thought was wondering what happened to one of what (I thought) was a major plot line.    Still, the strong lead character and the interesting situation carried it through.  Though I'm guessing it wasn't originally published in English, the descriptions made the location seem real.  I felt that I truly got the feel of what India was like for an orphaned child.    Now I just need to find time to re-watch the movie.  I'm interested in seeing what changes were made.  From my brief recollection, it seems like there were some significant differences, but I'll have to re-watch the movie to know for sure.    3.5/5 Stars

Really allowing fans to understand how this movie is better told with the breathtaking effects. (I do commend Lucas for insisting for the latest and greatest and not getting caught up in the cob webs, this is difficult for most artists...tho many would argue he's not an artist). Anywho ...Lucas, you're a billionaire, give us peasants what we've come to expect fro the added capacity of blu-ray. Theatrical and Directors cuts. I mean use Blade Runner as an example ^_^ :) We love you still George.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I watched the movie for about the sixth time today, with someone who had never seen it. He loved the story, the humor, and the visuals, and I enjoyed all of that once more. It really is a very entertaining movie, with great characters. I still get thrills from watching Summer Glau's amazing martial arts dances, and from some of great dialog in the movie.    If you've seen the movie only once, watch it again. And if you haven't seen it and you like a good action, science fiction, or suspense story, go buy, rent, or borrow this movie.

B000A6T1JU|5.0|The Warriors. Oddly enough, it wasn't until 2005 that I knew this movie existed. And that was due to the Playstation 2 game based on the movie. Oddly enough, it wasn't until 2010 that I actually got around to seeing the movie.    Admittedly, I've never seen the theatrical version. Only this with the comic book cuts. So it didn't bother me as some people seem to be bothered.    That said, what is The Warriors? It should be noted that the movie is actually based on a book of the same name though there naturally were some changes (such as there being white gang members whereas in the book all the members were black or Latino). The plot was inspired by an ancient story that had a group of mercenaries trapped miles behind enemy lines trying to fight their way to safety.    That's the basic set up for the movie. At the beginning, New York City's largest gang, the Riffs, led by a man named Cyrus organizes a gathering of the city's main gangs and their representatives. His goal is to unite the gangs into one \\"army\\" to effectively take control of the city. Unfortunately, for both Cyrus and the Warriors, he is murdered and his death is blamed on the Warriors. With every gang in the city out to get them, the main characters have to fight their way home to Coney Island.    You might could say this is a standard through and through \\"guy movie\\" though that of course doesn't mean women can't enjoy it either.    It's a collective hero movie meaning there's no one central character. The acting is pretty decent. Oddly enough, it should also be noted that this movie was many of the main characters' only acting role if you don't count the game.     The action is also nice. The Warriors must face off with several rival gangs in the process of making it home. This includes being chased down in a van, fighting in a bathroom, and a car blowing up.     Do they succeed? Are their names cleared for the murder of Cyrus? Soldier up and find out, as the Warriors would tell you.     All in all, if you're looking for a decent action movie to watch on a Friday night, The Warriors is a good movie to start with.

0525951652|2.0|This was one of those books I caught sight of and thought \\"Wow, Pillars of the Earth goes to the 20th Century!\\" and grabbed it, only to be disappointed.    Some have critiqued the shallowness of the characters and the unlikely coincidences--to some degree coincidences didn't bother me as I knew it would be a sweeping epic, where the characters kept running into each other in unlikely ways.    The shallowness of some of the characters, and most particularly, the horrible history was what turned me off.  Nearly every character who represents authority or privelige is, quite simply, a caricature of an upper class twit a la Monty Python, with few exceptions.  All the working class people are noble, knowledgable and articulate and all realize that their masters are idiots.  OK, I could handle that even though I found it a silly model for the book--and it didn't seem that was how the book was going to go, not for the first 100 pages or so.    The history is the biggest problem.  As a student of the era, I cringed when it became obvious that Follett was going to follow the \\"World War I disaster with mud, blood and poetry\\" model.  He uses his characters to present a shallow and frankly nonsensical model of how the war started.  Recent scholarship has quite clearly shown the role that Austria-Hungary and Germany played in turning a localized conflict into a world war.  All through the book, several characters bemoan how Germany \\"had no choice\\" but to go to war when Russian mobilized, a frankly silly notion.  Germany was the only nation that had a mobilization plan that involved violation of Belgium and Luxembourg as PART of mobilization--everyone else did not.      He almost goes so far as to indicate nobody was happy they had won in 1918--clearly silliness as any look at the historical record will indicate.  The demoralization came later and had much more to do with domestic politics, not with a perceived need to halt German aggression.    All British officers are idiots inthis book; in fact, all officers are with the exception of one of the younger German characters and the American advisor to President Wilson.  Wilson is portrayed as an almost god-like figure who knows what is best for all, and if only the benighted Europeans would just listen, all would be well. Wilson's inflexibility, stubborness and ability to offend his political equals is nowhere to be seen--the League of Nations fails \\"because everybody is stupid,\\" apparently.    While I expect some of the characters to believe such things, their introspective thoughts and some events are misleadingly portrayed as representing historical fact.  The socialist/working class point of view is portrayed as good, other views are silly and dangerous.      Political events in Russia are particularly misportrayed.  All the characters that oppose the Bolsheviks are idiots (or even perverts), while the Bolsheviks (who had to seize power in a coup) are seen as enjoying widespread support from everybody.  If things had been so simple, the Civil War would have been over in a week.  Allied intervention in Russia, which occured with cabinet support (UK) and the US administration, is depicted as a sneaky scheme engineered by Winston Churchill and one of the upper class twit characters.  Nor was the intervention \\"secret.\\"  Over time public support waned, but not at first.    Maybe this is the problem with trying to write a massive, sweeping epic, but I was disappointed and found it hard to stay engaged with the characters toward the end.  The bad history greatly diminished what started out as a very promising story.  I fear how the run up to World War II in the 20s and 30s will be portrayed in the next volume.
1416550534|5.0|On the next to the last page of this book, in the Author's Notes section, Kate Morton describes the literary elements in novels that most fascinate her, and I quote:<br />\\"...the haunting of the present by the past; the insistence of family secrets; return of the repressed; the centrality of inheritance (material, psychological and physical); haunted houses (particularly haunting of a metaphorical nature);...the entrapment of women (whether physical or social) and associated claustrophia; character doubling; the unreliability of memory and the partial nature of history; mysteries and the unseen; confessional narrative; and embedded texts.\\"<br />Since Morton's tastes appear to be mine, I was captured by this book from page one.

B003UESJH4|5.0|THE KING'S SPEECH is everything that a great movie should be.<br /><br />It tells a good story and it tells it well.<br /><br />After the death of his father (Michael Gambon) and the scandalous abdication of his older brother (Guy Pearce), Bertie (Colin Firth), who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life, is suddenly crowned King George VI of England.<br /><br />With the country on the brink of war, his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) arranges for her husband to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and after a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course of treatment that will cure the monarch's stammer and help him find the voice to encourage his people.<br /><br />David Seidler's well-crafted screenplay and Tom Hooper's sensitive direction transports us back to a not-so-long-ago era of innocence when the world was about to be shattered, once again, by war.<br /><br />The film, which covers two decades, spends much of its time dealing with court intrigues, primarily involving the affair between Edward VIII (Pearce) and his affair with twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.<br /><br />However, the spine of this story is the relationship and growing friendship between two men, the future king (Firth) and a commoner (Rush), who helps the ruler overcome his disability and become the inspiration of his nation.<br /><br />The performances by the entire cast, including Timothy Spall (as Churchill), Derek Jacobi, Claire Bloom and Anthony Andrews are perfect.  They transform names from out history books into real, multi-dimensional people.<br /><br />Some writers have commented that THE KING'S SPEECH is historically inaccurate, in that it glosses over Edward's possible Nazi sympathies.<br /><br />Seidler's script touches briefly on that issue, but one must remember that this is not a documentary, but a dramatic presentation of actual events.  This film is not about Edward.  He is merely a supporting player in a story that centers on his brother and Lionel Logue.<br /><br />Frankly, I think a future film that deals with Edward's sympathies toward Hitler and his cronies would make fascinating viewing.<br /><br />THE KING'S SPEECH marks one of the very rare times in recent years where my favorite movie of the year has won the Best Picture Oscar.<br /><br />Perhaps there's hope for the Academy yet.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B0034G4P7G|2.0|This movie begins with a socially inept smart aleck. Thus, from the very get-go, we don't really like this guy (feel free to compare any 'rags to riches tale', where we start out liking the main character, not rooting against him). Then we are thrown into \\"Haaaavad\\", where America's elites are educated. When they are not doing bong hits, they are using that 176 IQ and software to create contests of \\"which chick is hotter\\" (gee, and when I was in college in the Midwest, I was reading Socrates and Nietzsche and T.S. Eliot). Then we get the Winkelvoss Twins, more people we don't like, elitists. Then we have more inane software contests, culminating in Larry Sommers being very university and stating that the university will take the easy way out, and not take sides. Then we have the \\"trechery\\", and the guy we don't sympathize with moves to Cali, to be near yet more money. All the while, we still don't like him. I still don't understand the allure of Facebook, and I really disliked everyone in this movie.

It worked great the first time but broke up every time I tried to watch it after that. I tried three other DVD players in addition to the one I played it on the first time and each time the picture and sound broke up, stopped, and ruined the movie. The film itself is excellent, well made, and important. The extras are also very interesting. I just wish I could see the film again - the reason I bought the DVD in the first place.
0670022411|1.0|Is Deborah Harkness serious??  Or, more importantly, why did Viking even publish this book in its current form?  First of all, its at least 300 pages too long.  Midway through, I no longer was even sure where the storyline was going and, sadly enough, I didn't care.  So many times it felt more like a history lesson than a fictional novel ..... was the author trying to impress us with her fancy words and knowledge of alchemy, science, other languages?  Please, all I wanted was an exciting novel about witches that I couldn't put down.  I lost count how many times I read about Diana's breakfasts, lunches, dinners, daily workouts, sleep habits, and I'm pretty sure I could have skipped multiple pages without missing anything of real importance.  Diana was so annoying at times, that I found myself rooting for the meanies, hoping they would finally have a go at her.  The plot didn't even get intriguing when she met her vampire boyfriend, Matthew.  There wasn't so much as a spark of chemistry between them and, for a 1,500 year old vampire, Matthew was a borderline dud.  It matters little to me that this author has a sequel coming out to this novel.  I have no desire whatsoever to read anymore about the adventures of Diana and Matthew.

I feel that each memeber in the group should set aside some time, and Thank God almighty for giving them such great and wonderful talent to produce such great sounds. It is what I call Reality Music, Because after you have listened to their music, Reality really sits in.It is almost to the point that it is no words to be found in the Vocabulary to express this unreal talent, that these people have produced....NO WORDS!!! It is just simply Great. I hope they continue to make more music.I have had this CD since 1991. And I played it to death to the point I have had to buy 3-more copies.This CD reminds me of riding down the Interstate-35 into Austin, Texas just simply relaxing and listening to this kind of Music.

This is certainly one book that I don't mind re-reading.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a dark, gothic, rainy afternoon read.  And yes, it does have a certain creepy factor - somewhat reminiscent of  V. C. Andrews.  It is not a quick read - not a fast paced thriller, but I did find it to be a compelling read - hard to put down. Setterfield's prose is beautifully descriptive.

Stopping is a little trickier now since I can't get off the seat to steady my bike.  I've found I can use one tip-toe to do the job.

B003BTIGJO|4.0|Now coming back to it later, I love this album very much and think it was a very cool change for the group. It's more edgier than Sound of Water. More like power pop than chill out pop. The rap track is a bit silly but it has a nice melody in it. All the other tracks are good, as well as the bonus stuff. Good variety between songs. And unlike most people who really dislike the English narration speaking threw out the album, I liked it and thought it had proper merit being part of the albums atmosphere. It adds to the experience, on repeated listens. If you loved Tiger Bay, you'll like this album. More electronic pumped, heavier beats and very cool melodies infused in great synthesizer sounds. The production is decent as always. The singing is at times, kind of weak or uninspired but it always picks up to a better approach. 4 stars for a great fun time. This album will grab your attention because it's very unique (like Tiger Bay) and Saint Etienne won't ever be making another cool experimental album quiet like this ever again, so enjoy it.  Worth buying if you already own most of their other albums. If not, then you should probably start with \\"London Conversations\\" (a compilation of their most accessible songs and hits) or their third album Tiger Bay which has a good mix of both their older foundation sound and their newer transition into a more commercial electronic sounding pop sound.  Have fun!  If you love Saint Etienne, you also might like Club 8, Electribe 101, Propaganda. Some of my other favorite bands.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|... or at least that's the impression you get from how quickly this book moves, leaping from plot point to plot point, quickly introducing and then resolving drama at the drop of a hat. There are several times throughout the story that Kvothe as the narrator literally just glosses over entire plot points because they \\"aren't important\\" or \\"they bore me\\"; he will literallt set up a fairly major problem or occurance with a lot of drama, and then the next page will have something to the effect of \\"... but suffice it to say that all turned out okay, and now let's pick up our narrative three weeks later\\". It feels out of place and rushed because of how much attention is lavished both at the beginning of the book and in its predecessor on the minutae of Kvothe's day-to-day life at the Arcanum. It makes me wonder if the author got halfway through the book, panicked a bit because he realised this is only a trilogy, and decided he had to skip a bunch of stuff he really wanted to (or should have)explored in earnest to balance out the narrative.     The relationship between Denna and Kvothe does feel as if it's being drug out far too long, with a frustrating amount of text given over to Kvothe sighing at the sight of her and endless flirtatious will-the-won't-they-he-wants-to-but-oh-she's-so-difficult-to-catch banter, but there are a few scenes between them that are absolutely beautiful. One, involving a moonlight stroll in a garden, is sweet and poignant and even a little heartbreaking in its intimacy, and I felt like the book desperately needed so much more of that. Not just with Denna, but with other characters, to give Kvothe a chance to act like a person instead of a bullet list of heroic, smarmy accomplishments. It would have made me like him more than I do, which unfortunately is not as much as I should for being the protagonist and narrator.    Kvothe, disappointingly, feels more like wish fulfillment than ever as his exploits grow. More than once I caught myself rolling my eyes at what was rapidly turning into a piece of Mary Stu fan-fiction. Kvothe learns a sacred warrior's way never before taught outside its culture. Kvothe becomes a sex god women fall before and spends a ridiculous amount of time spouting smarmy, snort-worthy tripe about how much more he understands the gender than anyone else. It's frustrating because the rest of the cast feels like they're only there to be slavishly devoted to him, act as straw-men for him to defeat, or react in awe to the things he does. Even Kvothe's friends, Wil and Sim, are characterised by little more than how much they're willing to do for him; neither of them get any significant development, and the only time they're around is when they're bending over backwards to save Kvothe from himself or discussing how brilliant something he did was, or bemoaning how unfortunate it is that they aren't as clever as he. It's like they cease to exist when they aren't helping him with something... certainly he never spares them a thought otherwise.    I realise that this is essentially a fictional autobiography, and if you enjoy that sort of thing you'll probably find the One Man Show vibe a lot more appealing than I do, since it's basically expected, but with the spotlight planted so firmly on Kvothe and building him up into a legendary figure, there isn't a chance for the rest of the world to grow and really feel like somewhere you want to return to, with characters you want to know better.    There were things I liked about the book, of course; the dialogue is snappy, and at times laugh out loud funny. The environments and different cultures are fascinating. But Wise Man's Fear really does feel like it suffers too much from Middle Child Syndrome. A lot happens in the book, and a lot of it is entertaining, but so little of it feels like it's important at all to the big plot hook set up in the original book; that of Kvothe's quest to find the Chandrian. It almost feels like half of it could have been released as a collection of short stories after the trilogy is done and been better for it, giving us more time to become invested in the dark magic and mystery of the quest. As it is, it's a bit like listening to a very self absorbed person tell a story at a bar, an endless parade of \\"So then I, I, I, I\\" that is entertaining, but ultimately not as meaningful or memorable as it could have been.

Please, be fair to the authors who put in hard work writing for their fans and stop the insanity of bringing down a books rating because of the e-book price. Several times I have complained to Amazon but they still refuse to take non-reviews down.           Now \\"The Fifth Witness\\" brings back Mickey Haller, the original Lincoln Lawyer, and as a loyal fan I have read all of them, plus the Bosch series and have yet to be disappointed. Connelly knows how to plot, how to handle court room dramas better than Grisham and create real life characters. In this latest edition of the Lincoln Lawyer series Mickey Haller has an unpleasant client who very well might be innocent, yet he keeps insisting he doesn't care if she is innocent or not because his only job is to provide the best defense for his client.         In the beginning Haller has ventured into the world of house foreclosures, a lucrative new area for his skills as a defense attorney. Then his most annoying client is charged with murdering the bank loan officer who is trying to throw her out of her home. Connelly then proceeds to gather his team - even renting an office from which to conduct the defense - and he begins building his defense from the ground up. The writing is as skillful as ever, the plotting tight but not predictable, and the surprises keep coming as the trial progresses. This may not be Connelly's best book, but it comes darn close to the top three or four, so true fans will enjoy and new fans will want to go back and read his earlier thriller/mysteries/police procedurals as soon a possible.       A true master still at the top of his game.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|First let me say I am a huge Foo Fighters fan, and I had the pleasure of catching one of the secret gigs they did in a series of small clubs in the Los Angeles area back in Dec to Feb with about 200 others at a place called Spaceland.  They played all of Wasting Light from start to finish along with a greatest hits set afterwards. It was tough for me to get into Wasting Light during that show.  I had heard clips on youtube, but that doesn't do any song justice.  In fact, I'd say that hearing the songs live without knowing them sort of lowered my expectations of the new CD.  During that secret show, I kept thinking \\"it is cool to hear these songs live before anyone else, but it is especially ool to see FF in a small club and gosh, please finish these new songs so we can get to the songs everyone knows!\\"    So here is it, 2.5 months after that gig and I have the new CD in hand.  \\"Blown Away\\" is best I can put it. In a small club at full live volume the songs sounded muttered and messy.  Great rock show, but wondered how they would sound in a finished product and they do sound great. 100% Foo Fighters sound, but sort of a renewed focus, a new direction of sorts.      Not a bad song on the CD and certainly rocks more than any previous release, with a few songs still having that \\"power pop/punk\\" sound that myself and millions of others have loved all these years. Put it this way, if FF had released another polished CD like \\"Echos, Silence Patience and Grace\\", it would be getting stale and old.  I for one appreciate the risk in changing the sound and direction of the band and watching a band succeed in the process.    Standout tracks for me:  - Bridge Burning  - Rope  - White Limo (LOVE IT even if you can't understand a single lyric)  - These Days - prob my favorite  - A Matter of Time  - Walk    I really like the other songs, but after a few days I do find myself skipping over them when I am limited on time to hear these top songs.  Your mileage will vary.  I know a lotof other reviews are giving songs like \\"Dear Rosemary\\", \\"Arlandria\\" and \\"I Should Have Known\\" top billing.  I don't dislike them, just not standouts to me.    Summary - if you get this CD and don't love it, I say you aren't really a fan of rock-n-roll.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?<br /><br />Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.<br /><br />The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.<br /><br />Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.<br /><br />As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.<br /><br />I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it.them that lasts throughout the entire novel.     As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers.

0143116738|5.0|People can learn so much from either Sir Ken Robinson's books or his talks. Where I first heard about him was from his TED talk \\"Do Schools Kill Creativity\\". I thought that this topic would illustrate a more difficult point for the public to grasp. This talk raised concerns about the Education System in modern society. Robinson also wrote a new book, THE ELEMENT: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything. This book discusses the importance of linking ones passion with his/her goals. The book also discusses why we shouldn't beat ourselves up too badly for failing to meet a school's standards. Everyone's life has its own destination, and it is that person who has the power to reach it. I find that this book may enlighten most people who find themselves a bit astray or feel they lack utility.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|There are few good songs on this album. Most of them are strange and weird. He really does need to make a full recovery until he releases a really good album. Some songs are pretty good.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|I'm not going to review the films, that's been done to death.  You either like them or you don't.  If you don't like them, don't buy them.  I'm just talking here about the DVDs themselves.  Watching them on an upscaling DVD player on a 32 inch 720p TV, the picture quality is good, but not excellent. I noticed a few scenes where there appeared to be slight ghost images, especially when characters are against a white or light colored background. But overall its not a distraction.  The overall contrast and color levels are very good and the sound is great also.  This is a quality product at a good price.
B000NA1OXY|4.0|This is a good album. If it didn't have all of the bad words, however, I would have rated it 5 stars. She has good songs and good lyrics...just the words that make this 4 stars.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I knew some about this Lowell family, but not the full story. I'm glad I didn't, because the plot's freshness was a bonus on top of a superbly acted, gritty, real-feel movie that deserves every accolade heaped on it from all directions. Bale is amazing, as is the entire cast. The chorus of the sisters is one of the most frightening, anxiety-inducing sights ever on film. The fight scenes are great when they need to be, but it's the human stories that will leave such a huge impression.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I really like the songs. This is her 2nd best cd. I really like, \\"Dear Mr. President.\\" The problem is too many bad words. I believe that she could have done this without all of the words. That's the only problem. Otherwise, it would be 4 1/2 stars.
B00386EZJU|5.0|John Powell's score for How to Train Your Dragon is pure magic.  The film is story of Vikings battling dragons but is also a romantic adventure.  Mr. Powell expertly combines heroic music with lighter melodies. He also is a very skillful orchestrator. In this score, the Celtic theme dominates with the use of bagpipes, penny whistle and hardanger fiddle. The use of male and female choruses is beautifully woven into the music.     In tracks like The Downed Dragon, Mr. Powell skillfully weaves music that conveys the fear and curiosity Hiccup has over Toothless and scenes of action are nicely depicted in Dragon Training.   The hushed reverence of The Dragon Book is beautifully conceived. The music depicting Hiccup and Toothless flying (Test Drive, Astrid Goes for a Spin and Romantic Flight) are beautifully drawn, capturing the feel of the accomplishment and grandeur of the experience.  The final battle music nicely captures the action (Battling the Green Death and Counter Attack) as does the apprehensive tone of the aftermath (Where's Hiccup).      The score for How to Train Your Dragon delivers music that supports the vision of the film's director but also the emotional response of the audience.  I agreed with Andy Trudeau (who reviewed the Oscar nominees this year on NPR) that \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" was my pick for the award based on the inspiration and skill of John Powell in creating a sound world for the film.

B000002U94|5.0|Detroit rocker Bob Seger and his Silver Bullet Band released its second live album entitled Nine Tonight in September of 1981.<br />Nine Tonight was Seger's thirteenth album in total. I think that this live album is just as good, if not better than the first live album, 1976's Live Bullet (which saw a young, hungry Seger prior to stardom whereas Nine Tonight captures him at the height of his success with the #1 album Against the Wind).<br />Half of Nine Tonight, like Live Bullet, was recorded at the legendary Cobo Hall in Detroit, MI (tracks 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14) in June of 1980 and the album's other eight tracks (tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 15 and 16) were recorded at the long demolished Boston Garden in my native Boston, MA back in October, 1980 and mixed at Bayshore Recording Studios in Florida by Bill Szymczyk (who produced albums for The Eagles, Joe Walsh, J Geils Band and The Who).<br />Seger is joined by longtime Silver Bullet members bass player Chris Campbell and sax player Alto Reed (both of whom are still in the band today) and guitarist Drew Abbott (whom would leave The Silver Bullet Band during The Distance sessions in 1982). There were some changes to The Silver Bullet Band lineup since Live Bullet. First, drummer Charlie Allen Martin was paralyzed in a car accident in 1977 and was replaced by David Teegarden (whom would also leave the band after Nine Tonight's release). Second, keyboard player Robyn Robbins was replaced in 1980 by ex-Grand Funk Railroad keyboard player Craig Frost (whom made his debut on Nine Tonight and is still in The Silver Bullet Band today).<br />The only two exclusive tracks on Nine Tonight is the opening title cut which was from the movie \\"Urban Cowboy\\" released in 1980. The track was intended for Against the Wind but the producer for the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" soundtrack album (Eagles manager Irving Azoff) had the song ready for inclusion on the album (UC). Then we segue into the album's biggest hit \\"Tryin' To Live My Life Without You\\" which is a great song.<br />Nine Tonight also features blistering live versions of tracks from Seger's three million sellers 1976's Night Moves (represented by \\"Mainstreet\\", \\"The Fire Down Below\\", the title cut to Night Moves and \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\"), 1978's Stranger in Town (represented by \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\", \\"Feel Like a Number\\" and \\"We've Got Tonight\\") and 1980's chart topper Against the Wind (represented by \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me', the album's title cut, his ode to Jane Fonda \\"Her Strut\\", \\"Fire Lake\\" and \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\").<br />We end the album, like Live Bullet, with \\"Let it Rock\\". This version is more electrifying than on the Live Bullet version clocking in at over 10 plus minutes. The CD however features an edited version because otherwise, it would have been believed back in 1989, that the track would exceed the maximum playing time on a CD or it would have become a 2 CD set (CDs can fit up to 80 minutes of music). The LP label gave Let it Rock's playing time as 8 minutes and 26 seconds but it is actually 10 minutes and 35 seconds. The CD version is only a little over 6 minutes and uses the ending of The Fire Down Below to end the track instead of the big finale so that's my only gripe about the CD (I hope a remastered CD is released soon with the full version like on the original LP, cassette and 8-track issues).<br />Nine Tonight was released to massive sales and the album peaked at #3 on the Billboard album charts and sold millions upon release. The album deserves to be re-released in its full glory and can fit on one CD no problem or worse comes to worse, re-release it on two (I'll be a first day buyer).<br />Highly recommended!ch is a great song.   Nine Tonight also features blistering live versions of tracks from Seger's three million sellers 1976's Night Moves (represented by \\"Mainstreet\\", \\"The Fire Down Below\\", the title cut to Night Moves and \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\"), 1978's Stranger in Town (represented by \\"Hollywood Nights\\", \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\", \\"Feel Like a Number\\" and \\"We've Got Tonight\\") and 1980's chart topper Against the Wind (represented by \\"You'll Accomp'ny Me', the album's title cut, his ode to Jane Fonda \\"Her Strut\\", \\"Fire Lake\\" and \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\").

0670022411|5.0|While reading through A Discovery of Witches, I confess, I couldn't help but compare it to Twilight. That being said, most of those comparisons consisted of, \\"This is what Twilight should have been.\\" They share some of the same elements, chiefly a romance involving a powerful male vampire, but where Twilight stays firmly entrenched in the land of teenyboppers, this romance is of a more mature variety. If mature intelligent adults want to fantasize about a vampire romance that's not caught up in being dark, edgy, or 'big-city' modern, this is the way to go about it!<br /><br />Unlike the bulk of urban fantasy, the characters here are not hip, on the edge of fashion, incredibly popular, or filled with woes about their latest crush or how their job isn't fun. They're professionals, mostly researchers, and they come across as people who have made peace with themselves. Even the main character, Diana, who in many ways has not actually made peace with herself and her magical heritage, still understands who she is, is comfortable with herself as a person, and is refreshingly more focused on research papers than parties, scholarship more than socializing. She's the kind of character I look at and say to myself, \\"I want to be just like her,\\" and I can relate to her because she isn't what so many urban fantasy heroines are. She isn't young, pretty, and modern. She's dedicated, fairly quiet, and interested in academia.<br /><br />The research that the author put into this novel shows. Harkness has definitely done her homework when it comes to alchemy, genetics, location, culture, history, and, unsurprisingly, wine. While occasionally imparting all this information borders on breaking the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule of writing, honestly, I can't imagine another way that it could have all been presented in a way that makes sense both to the reader and in the way that the characters are explaining. Harkness evidently spent a good amount of time asking all the right questions (for example, if vampires have extra chromosomes, just how do they get them when they came from human stock?) and finding good answers to them that make sense. I learned a good deal while reading this, and moreover, I also experienced that mental shift that comes with asking your own questions and trying to figure out the answers about things you may never have considered before.<br /><br />Harkness weaves a wonderful mystery, dropping hints in all the right places and tying things together very smoothly. She can make things sexy without being graphic, and make academia sound far more exciting than it probably has any rights to be. (At least for those who aren't total bibliophiles, that is!) Her style is wonderful, flowing nicely along and carrying the reader across time and pages to a place where they won't want to leave. This is one author well worth keeping an eye on, and I'm very excited for the next book of the series. This comes highly recommended; do not miss your chance to read this one!s have extra chromosomes, just how do they get them when they came from human stock?) and finding good answers to them that make sense.

1600242405|5.0|Excellent 22.5 hours on headphones! 20 CDs? CD 3 I had to play 3 times since it was so rich with lost letter kept by Aunt Patty for 50 years that Keith wrote about meeting Mick, with amazing detail and clarity-just before press time.    CD 4- about guitar-even if you don't play guitar in one very brief section of the 4 CD.    No wonder it's called LIFE. It's so rich, textured and interesting-you will enjoy it for the very modest purchase price and I really recommend the AUDIO BOOK vs the printed page version.    And get this: I don't even really enjoy The Rolling Stones, or even Keith Richard's guitar playing! I am a fan of Clapton, Gary Moore and Django Reinhardt much more so, and bassists- Jack Bruce, Charlie Mingus and Tommy Shannon.    But this was such a surprise-I had to well share my comments. And I go thru alot of books. This is very, interesting. SOLID 5 Stars. SOLID.    As I write this review, and sending one to my brother-I am looking forward to CD 5-20. OK? Make sure your audio book has the 20 CDs. I thought I didn't have time to listen to this on headphones...I realized I did not have time NOT to listen.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|The first time I saw Neon Genesis Evangelion was in about 2002 on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. It has become one of my favourite shows and I'm not overly into anime. The ending/endings of the show were truly love them or hate them and while I enjoyed them I can see why people don't. When I found out that they were remaking the series into movies I was interested but never knew that this would turn out the way it did. The movie is less about reinacting moments from the series like in the first movie but actually recreating them with some spectactular fight scenes with stunning animation and some great sound as I found the english and japanese languages to be very good in terms of quality. The story is amazingly told and the characters development is good. End of Evangelion had some very disturbing moments in it I found some scenes in this film to very disturbing to that same level (I won't spoil them here) and the ending is brilliant. I look forward to when 3.0/3.33 comes out (which is probably going to take a while) and would definately order it off Amazon again and just saying, I ordered it in New Zealand and it arrived in 16 days. Was very impressed with the quick delivery and would definately order off this site again.
0312600844|3.0|I found the underlying theme of this book to be about wanting what we think others have, and how that drives our behavior throughout our lives.  How it makes us miserable, in fact.  The characters in this story are consumed with comparing themselves to others, a dead-on social commentary about American culture.
B004ODLUF8|1.0|Several minutes of commercials and trailers for completely un-related videos into the program, you finally get the rest of the thing which is merely bragging about how they went about making the video, with frequent references to the personnel on the three missions to the HST, most of these lifted directly, or shared with, the footage from the NASA website and/or NASA TV.  There are precious few shots of a VERY few of the discoveries of the HST over the years.  A few of these are animated to abstraction, closing in or moving away from the objects that are subjects of the current view.  I'll save the jewel case and toss the rest of it.  I'd be too embarrassed to sell it to anyone, even used, and I surely wouldn't wish to build up anybody else's hopes and have them crash as mine did.  The Hubble Space Telescope was a brilliant and quite valuable project; this video is not!    Save the money, or use it on something worthwhile.  Like a box seat to watch paint dry.
B004LFO0FG|4.0|I was not sure I was going to love this album. I am a HUGE Britney fan, but I wasn't feeling \\"Would You Hold It Against Me\\" & I had previewed the album & it all just sounded like remixes so I was a little bummed that I wasn't going to like it. But, being the fan I am, I will always buy just to support my girl.<br />That being said, I was pleasently surprised. I love most of this album. \\"Big Fat Bass\\" would be the one exception I have to that comment. But I don't like Black Eyed Peas, so not surprised.<br />I love \\"Till The World Ends\\" and \\"Drop Dead Beautiful\\".<br />I will not go as far as to say it's my favorite Britney album, I really think Blackout was the best to date (even though it had no reason to be, with all the crazy she was going though)!<br />And I don't really think any of the songs are as sexy as some classics like 'I'm A Slave For You\\" but they are all catchy & I am happy I bought this album.<br />I think if you're a Britney fan you will be a fan & if you're not, well, I think you're missing out!
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This book is so moving and raw! Portia did a great job in writing this book, it wa very honest and real. This is definately one of the best books I've ever read! I could really connect with this book and it was so hard to put down! I would definately recommend this book! :)
0307595579|5.0|I had not fallen into the hype associated with this series, I had no idea what the books were about & lacked any desire to find out. But I ride the train back & forth to work & therefore read alot. One day I had forgotten to grab a new book & had nothing to read. A fellow train rider offered me his copy of the first in this series & thus began my love affair with Lisbeth Salander & Mikael Blomkvist!<br />So I borrowed his copy of the first & bought the second in paperback. I wanted to buy the third but was holding off to find it on sale since it was about $27 new. I saw this set on sale for $32 & couldn't pass it up. The books are SO wonderful looking. My favorite is the yellow, it has a red dragon imprinted all over the back cover. The pages are roughly edged so easier to flip through, I just couldn't have been happier with this purchase.<br />I don't feel a strong need to describe the book series because I assume most people know what it entails at this point. Just want to let book lovers know that if you don't already own the series in hard back, these books are much better looking than the mass produced copies you see around.
B004WPIJ4I|2.0|Lady GaGa's back with the second single from her new album \\"Born This Way,\\" tentatively titled \\"Judas\\". The song, laced with a post electronic industrial sound, starts off in the same vein as \\"Bad Romance,\\" however, it fails to do what that song did; captivate. This song is over produced and like Born This Way, unnecessary. It might seem like the dark days of The Fame Monster were over, but it it looks like they've just begun.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I have been a fan of animation for quite sometime.I don't limit myself to one type or the other although CG has always rubbed me the wrong way.Despite this, Pixar has to me picked up where Disney had died.To me it was always something I could count on.I love Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 was honestly one of the few sequels in movie history that not only lived up to its original it surpassed it in some aspects.After Disney died in the early 2000's and it seemed animation had come to the point of horrendous CG after CG movie Pixar held out and kept producing some of the most groundbreaking pieces in animation that anyone could enjoy.It truly was Disneys successor.After still being in love with them after their last masterpiece up I was even more adamant that even if animation dies Pixar will push on through.That was until Toy Story 3.Truth be told I saw this movie coming forever and of course as a fan I know most movie cant keep the magic going into its 3rd iteration but this movie wasnt just a disappointing sequel, it was a dissapointment for a Pixar movie.Its starts off with Woody and the gang going through a make believe sequence which I admit was a fantastic way to start.It is followed by a montage of Andy aging which of course all boys due.As he ages you see that eventually he grows out of playing with toys like we all do.Everything is still all good.Then all hell breaks loose.None of the characters retain their right personalities, all the humor turns from heartfelt and situational and well planned out to slapstick,and the story is as a whole unimportant to anything.Lets start with the characters.Woody has for all extents and purposes always been kind of a dick.I mean he always learn and pulls through but he always has an attitude and that made his character.In Toy Story 3 he is basically just all slapstick.He gets hurt in ways that in previous Toy Storys would have left him hurt and yet he comes out fine.I know they are dolls but when there is no mortality they basically become Mary Sues.I mean in Toy Story 2 when Woody had his arm fall off it showed they were realistic.And lets not even speak about how badly they ruined Buzz.He isnt a character anymore.He is running gag comical relief and nothing more.WHy he is even in here is beyond me.The story is unfortunately not great either.I mean its not that it is bad per say its just it has no point.In Toy Story 1 Woody had to deal with being replaced and how it affected his life.In Toy Story 2 we have a similiar story with different situations.These made the characters grow and really feel relatable.But TOy Story 3 is more a fan fiction than an actual story.The only real parts that stand out are the beggining and the end and only because they are personal and what the whole movie should have been about.Not some side story that only leaves about 10 minutes of real story.I could stand all of these changes if they hadnt changed the one thing that made Toy Story so timeless and amazing.Seeing dolls as human is incredibly beautiful.To see their mortality and how living in a world as hidden creatures and how it affected them made them into something truly unique.When I can feel true emotion from a doll you know something is right.Toy Story 3 broke all that and spit on it.When it comes down to it this movie was created for commercialism.It is nothing more than a way to make money off something that would sell even if it was horrible and it will.The sad thing is more than likely Disney forced Pixar into this in the wake of a downwardly spiraling economy but even so for it to be this bad is unacceptable by Pixar standards.Even more proof is the fact that Pixars next movie is a cashout as well seeing as Cars managed to sell merchandise well after 2 years since it had been released despite being what I consider to be the most disappointing Pixar film but bad by no means.I guess in the end Im more insulted by the fact that losing Pixar is losing some of the last true Disney animation we haveleft and it marks the death of animation as a whole.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Harold Crick is a nice man, a little dull at times, but honest and hardworking nonetheless. When he finds out his life is being controlled by an author writing about a character of the same name, and that the author is trying to come up with a not-so-happy ending for the character, Harold must figure out how to prevent his \\"untimely\\" death. In the meantime, he learns to appreciate the time he does have to live.<br /><br />I really liked Maggie Gyllenhaal and Queen Latifah's roles in this movie. Even though they were both supporting characters, I feel like they're the ones who really carried this film. I also liked some points that the movie implied about literature. As unwanted as graphic situations in some books can be, sometimes you need them to make a story worth reading. Sometimes, I see reviewers on Amazon give a book a bad rating because they were disturbed by the crime, death, rape, etc. that occurred in the story they read. But imagine if the stories were completely censored down to the bone, and nothing bad ever happened in any of them. The story would lose some of its appeal, just like this movie would if there were no problems to solve.<br /><br />That being said, although this movie was enjoyable, I would disagree with the movie characters who insisted that the author NEEDS to kill off the character in her book. While the author could write something bad to happen to him, it didn't necessarily need to be death, especially since the author found out that her writing had a voodoo effect. If she was such a talented writer, she would find another way to make her book interesting.

1439102724|5.0|Disclaimer: I am a huge JP fan, have met her, seen her speak, and read nearly half her novels. So this is a bit biased considering that. BUT, I will say Sing You Home breaks her previous mold of always having a crime committed early on, with a hero or heroine who simply refuses to speak, and readers left wondering what will happen until a legal battle and big twist at the end. This time, JP focuses more on developing the characters, letting us get to know each of them through a majority of the book, with no real crime happening but a legal drama nonetheless. I didn't want it to end! I fell in love with each character (even the born-again Christian husband, despite my liberal left-wing leanings), and I could really see all sides of the issue. There are things JP says in ways that no one else can. Her writing is so intuitive, and I don't think a contemporary author out there does the research that she does to tackle so many different topics in one 450-page span. Kudos to you, JP, and you leave me waiting with baited breath once again for your next endeavor!
B003UESJHO|4.0|I didn't know anything about the people in this story before watching it and I found it to be a fresh take in familiar territory. Bale is absolutely amazing as the could a been boxer/junkie who has a lot to offer his younger brother in the boxing profession if he can just FOCUS!. It's sad, funny and realistic, which makes this a well rounded film well worth seeing.
B004WPIJ4I|5.0|I was waiting for this song thinking that it was coming out later this week (meaning Tuesday April 19) but then I was reading stuff and I stumbled upon a tweet of GaGa's saying something that had to do with buying Judas on iTunes. So I looked it up on iTunes and I found it. Then I went on here and found it. The single is amazing. She is so honest with the songs that she makes and I can really feel that she means every word she says in this song. This is an amazing song about love and being in love with Judas. If you like pop or good music buy this song.
0316098337|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I read it in two days, and I thought about it long afterward.  It is told through the eyes and voice of Jack, a five year old boy.  His innocence and his love for Ma combine to create something touching and unusual but very important.  It is unlike any other book I have read. It is potent, dark at times, but very endearing.

B001L5U15M|2.0|For myself I found this bag to be good to better.  I was able to pack my gear with some thought and rearranging the bag held what I wanted it to hold.    The down fall for me with this bag was the horrible sling/strap configuration.  No matter how I rearranged the bag/sling/strap once the bag was loaded the sling either choked me or cut off circulation to my left arm.    The bag/sling combination is designed to go over the left shoulder, across the chest and accessed from the right side of the body.  No other way is possible with this bag/sling combination to wear it as the literature describes as a messenger bag type of sling/strap.    I tried to like this bag but the fact of it's design, inflexible sling and inadequate padding for the shoulder left me no choice but to return it for a refund.    Through much difficulty with the seller and working through Amazon's guarantee folks I finally got back my initial purchase price refunded.  No fault of the bag manufacturer.    I can thank Amazon's guarantee people for that as the seller (I will not mention by name) was less than willing to participate in the refund process but were engrossed in the blame game when they failed to have their ducks lined up correctly on their Amazon storefront ie; product return policy not on the site.    Kudos Amazon for your guarantee policy and all the advice and assistance to return my purchase price.    I did email to Tamrac with a nice email about my findings and dissatisfaction with this bag.  Much to my dismay their response was less than favorable to me.  I used Lowepro and or Tamrac bags for my 35mm gear from day one but I have gone elsewhere now.  I decided to give Think Tank an opportunity to make me happier than Tamrac and their bag design did.    As of this writing I cannot make comments on the Think Tank product as I ordered it only today.    More NEWS as it happens, film at eleven.

B004P9FAK2|2.0|So, the first info says 3 discs but the description only says two - for both 5 and 6.    So, which is it and what is the mysterious and possibly non-existant 3rd disc??    Also, if material was cut to shorten the final film (i.e. removed only for length) then there should be no need for the director to do anything.  An editor/edit team simply inserts the already ready footage (electronic signals) back at the points they were moved from.  I do not know why (sarcasm) but I have a feeling there will be a New, Improved Double Ultimate Edition in our futures.

Although highly intrigued by the topic, for the life of me could not bring myself to finish.

The body is desperate to heal and find a way to compensate even for the most debilitating conditions.  Hats off to the author for bringing the power of human brain to the general public.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|While I often quite like Ferris' attitude, I can't like the Kindle edition of this book.     Timothy Ferris states in the introduction that this is a book you should dip into, and suggests series of chapters that should be read if you want to lose weight, gain weight, have better sex, get fit, etc. All well and good, BUT there is no table of contents in the Kindle edition of this book! That's right, no table of contents. So if you are planning to do what Tim Ferris suggests, you need to search through the text to find the start of each chapter (not easy, since the chapter headings aren't unique).     As to the content (if you can find it), it's a little too heavy on the chemical supplements for my taste (Tim made his money selling these), and worryingly high on the number of product links. Is this good advice (albeit often based on a limited scientific sample - i.e. what worked for Tim) or is this product placement gone mad?    I'd suggest a non-Kindle edition for anybody who does want to read this book: the lack of table of contents is a killer on the iPhone / iPod where there are 12,390 locations to laboriously step through.

B004WI6WG2|5.0|This episode is yet another example of just how perfectly this half hour comedy has stepped into the void of funny sitcoms on tv today.  In this second season I have discovered more the hilarity of yet other cast members in this family ensemble.  Yes, one of my favorites, Cam, is terrific this time with his godawful school musical production.  He is determined to turn a grammar school musical into a Sondheim like production and is hilarious while doing so.  However, Phil, the son-in-law in the series, is just as funny with one of his usual blunders.  He made this ad for his real estate practice which shows his whole family.  The ad in print is fine but he has it painted onto his van as well and the painters have to wrap it around the van.  Now the ad looks like the ad for a prostitution ring with his wife and teen daughter as the two prime hookers.  They haven't noticed yet and Phil is desperate to keep them away from the van.  This show remains one of my top favorites for the year and I have enjoyed season two every bit as much as season one.

B001TODCII|4.0|Most people love it and a few hate it and both sides have valid points.  Viewed purely as an action movie it does what it says on the tin!  If you want to start analysing it as if it was an art house film then, of course, you can find fault because clichés do abound.  First off there's the air-headed 17 year old daughter, Kim, doted on by the ex-CIA specialist killing machine played efficiently by Neeson, who's been cast aside by the blinkered, indulgent mother, played by Janssen, for the safer and much richer second husband, Xander Berkeley.  Next, Kim decides she wants to do the groupie thing with her equally air-headed mate and troll around Europe after a rock group.  Naturally, doting father, who knows the ways of the world, fiercely objects but dumb mum sees no problem with this - after all, you're only young once!     The girls reach Paris safely, the first stop on their tour, but fall foul to the most horrible of scams.  Enter the East European nasties!  This is the bit, of course, that plays in to the most profound of our prejudices about the yellow peril, going back to such pernicious heavies as Dracula himself; the peril from the east!  This time, though, it's not Transylvania getting the bad press but the Albanian mafia, trafficking young women for prostitution, and Kim and her mate fit the bill nicely.  Dad duly brushes the dust from his skill set and proceeds to track down the kidnappers killing anything and everything in his way, with apparent impunity.    So what's the problem?  The action is handled brilliantly and, whilst the inevitable fight scenes do stretch the boundaries of probability, the baddies well and truly get their just deserts.  Just think about this: if your daughter was snatched and sold into slavery to be the sex toy for some rich sheik and you were a CIA trained killing machine with powerful financial resources available to you would you let anything stand in your way to rescue her?  Of course not! So the premise is fine: the baddies have to come from somewhere so why not let Albania have its turn; there have been plenty of nasty Brits - think, Die hard?  And as for the many improbabilities - it's fiction for crying out loud: albeit fiction, which has, unfortunately, echoes of the sometimes, very unpleasant real world. Perhaps, some people need reminding of this.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|The Lonesome Dove mini-series is absolutely fantastic.  As a movie fan, I've always liked Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.  They are both great in this Western.    I can write all about the characters in this Western, but would like to focus on the two protagonists.  Duvall's character, Gus, is light-hearted, enjoys life and entertainment, and is openly kind and caring.  Jones' character, Woodrow, is reserved, hard-working, and covertly caring.  Both characters are fair, equitable, smart, great leaders, justice-seekers, and fearless.  In essence, what one lacks or doesn't display, the other does.  A great friendship built on trust, experience, and complimentary attributes.     Throughout the movie you really come to know and love these characters, as well as others.  The music is great, the scenic land shots are beautiful, and the story is excellent.   I looked forward to each part of the movie and couldn't wait to start the next.  The only disappointment with this movie is that it had to end!

B004LFO0FG|5.0|Note: I'm a kid using my dad's account.  I'm a new Britney fan, but I have listened to her old music so I do know her well. I decided to buy Femme Fatale, her latest work, since I loved the singles until datae ('Hold It Against Me' and 'Till The World Ends')    My song reviews:  1- Till The World Ends - 10/10 The song is CATCHY and awesome to dance to, Ke$ha style since she co-wrote the song with her producers, this is an amazing start to the album.  2- Hold It Against Me - 10/10 I love it, it sounds a lot like TTWE but it's another type of dance song. A perfect continuation to TTWE, loved the music video to this song.  3- Inside Out - 10/10 Slower than the 2 first tracks, but Britney's vocals make it just as danceable as the previous ones. Love it.  4- I Wanna Go - 10/10 So catchy, lovin' the ''I-I-I Wanna Go-O-O''  5- How I Roll - 9/10 Britney's vocals sound amazing here, but it's a bit weak.  6- (Drop Dead) Beautiful ft. Sabi - 10/10 FAVE, this song features a new female rapper called 'Sabi', Britney and Sabi sounded both awesome in here. Chorus is awesome.  7- Seal It With A Kiss - 10/10 I love the ''Oo oo oo oo'' in the song, and I also love the chorus.  8- Big Fat Bass ft. will.i.am - 8.5/10 This song could be better without will.i.am's vocals.  9- Trouble For Me - 10/10 I love this, I heard this was the first song Britney recorded for Femme Fatale.  10- Trip To Your Heart - 10/10 AMAZING SONG  11- Gasoline - 9/10 I like it  12- Criminal - 10/10 Awesome song, it's the last song in the Standard edition (the one I bought) and an awesome end since it's a lot different for me than the other songs.    I know I didn't comment the songs really ''deeply'', but just like Britney herself said, the music speaks for itself.    Both Standard and Deluxe packages are digipacks, I love the Standard packaging and I think I won't buy the Deluxe, I'll just download the bonus tracks together with ''Scary'', the exclusive Japanese and Fan edition track. I also heard the Deluxe packaging rips easy.
0439023513|1.0|This book was a huge letdown and became a slog rather than a pleasure to read.  The first book was excellent and the second pretty good too once it got going, but this is almost indescribably bad.  The narrative is clunky and barely functional and Katniss quickly becomes an annoyance rather than the central figure in the story. Her constant second-guessing of people's motives (almost always making the wrong assumption) and harsh treatment of other characters quickly destroys any sympathy you ever had for her throughout the series.  There is no sense of suspense or urgency in this book, unlike the first two in the series.           Mild spoiler alert:    Crucial parts of the plot are dealt with in the space of a paragraph and then barely mentioned again (including the absurdly matter of fact way that major characters are killed off- and yes I realise the writer has stated that she was trying to illustrate the arbitrary and indiscriminate nature of killing during wartime but this does not excuse poor plot and character development).  The most likeable character in the series (Peeta) becomes a peripheral figure for most of the book leaving a cold emotionless core to the proceedings.  Not to mention the fact that Katniss is seconds away from casually putting an arrow through his brain on at least two occasions as if he is just some random person who means nothing to her (even though she spends at least half of the trilogy tortured by the thought of losing him and swearing to protect his life at all costs).  My last point regarding the story is that the final battle descends into some kind of Lord of the Flies esque farce where a supposedly hi-tech enemy resorts to using primitive traps, killer wasps, and booby traps to fight back.  I know it's a teenage book but Collins is surely insulting the intelligence of her readers here.     This honestly reads like the first draft of a novel that was never finished and I can only assume that the publishers were desperate to get it on the shelves and so neglected to give the writer sufficient time to have it proof-read, sense-checked, edited and re-written into something coherent.  A wasted opportunity- let's just hope the filmmakers tear this one up and come up with something better.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|So, I fall into a torn category.  While the writing was pretty good, though some descriptions were a bit too long for me, regardless of the writing the story just didn't 'do it' for me.    Perhaps I built up too much after listening and reading the multitude of praises about the compelling yet brutal story.  Honestly, I'm a very eclectic reader, so having read such novels by Laymon and Kilborn, my idea of brutal is pretty hardcore.    What the 'contestants' had to go through at young ages was extreme, but the book just didn't truly convey this brutality for me.  I get it's a YA novel and there shouldn't be the level of horror and devastation as a Laymon or Kilborn novel, but this still is just 'eh'.    I would say that 'Meh' sums up my feelings for this book.  There were amazing parts to the story, but by the end I felt like I'd wasted too much time trying to get through the story rather than sinking in and enjoying the journey.    More people seemed to have enjoyed this rather than those like myself who feel they are pushing it with 3 stars.    My vote:    2 stars based on story.  Got 3 stars because the writing really is decent.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Awesome movie...  I have seen it many times....  Although I never received the copy I ordered from Amazon.  They used the Post Office and my address in the Lake Tahoe region was apparently \\"undeliverable\\" by the ponies.  So I never saw this movie in my new system.  But it is a good movie.  Then, get this, to top it all off, Amazon says they will refund the monies and it would take 7-10 days to post in my bank account.  It never did.  It still has not showed up.  I did get an email that mentioned a three dollar credit for future purchases but I have no idea how to use them.  My money never came back, that's for sure.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I just watched this movie and after seeing Natalie Portman's performance I'm now convinced the Oscars are as political as I always thought them to be.    For one thing, there was barely any dialogue in the movie and Portman's lines never consisted of more than two sentences at a time. Even my non movie buff boyfriend commented about it. How do you win an Oscar with zero acting? We know Portman had a double doing all the intricate dancing, so that basically leaves her screaming and crying the rest of the movie.     I guess I'm just one of the dumb peasants who didn't get it, but Black Swan is horribly overrated, as was Portman's \\"acting.\\"
B001UV4XHY|5.0|First of all, this movie needn't get another actual review from me, because there are too many reviews anyhow and mine would never be read. So rather than lecture on about how this is one of the best in the series (and it really is) I would like to address some of the 1 and 2 star reviews. I find it sad that people's ignorance and stupidity has to diminish the rating of this fabulous movie. Yes I know the ratings on Amazon really don't matter, but I really bothers me.     So to the reviewer that gave the movie 2 stars for not completing the Dobby's Burial scene and explaining Harry's choice between the Horocrux's and the Hallow's, you might like to know that is only Part 1. There is a freaking reason why they split the movie into 2 parts, that is because there were things that could not be pushed into a single film. Ever think they might address that in Part 2?    And to that person who rated the movie 1 star because he claimed he couldn't review the movie because he hadn't watched it yet, then why did you write that in the form of a review with 1 star?    Finally, to the person who states that it was a failure because he is a huge fan and it didn't meet his expectations, so he was going to leave the Harry Potter series, I wouldn't call that being such a huge fan.    I could go on and on and on, but I'll stop there.

B004ISVH7U|5.0|After I had purchased Frank Zappa's Lumpy Money, and had owned both sets of Beatles remasters for over a year, I thought, \\"okay, this is it - I can't think of any other records to buy, so I'm done...\\"  Not true.  I heard about the \\"Bridge\\" remaster and read about it on this site and was excited when I'd seen there was a DVD containing all this rare footage.  I had to go out and get it.  I'm not going to go on so much about the album itself - we've all heard it about 50,000,000 times, and it's a great one.  It was like The Beatles taking the very best tracks from Sgt Pepper and Abbey Road and editing them together.  It was S & G's swansong, as Abbey Road was, but it was also a shattering breakthrough, a la Sgt Pepper.      I watched the \\"Harmony Game\\" documentary and agreed with the sentiment expressed within, that Simon & Garfunkel couldn't really make another album together after this.  Sure, they could still write songs, harmonize and bring in the best musicians, and it would be great, but would it have the emotional-rollercoaster impact of Bridge over Troubled Water? Not just the song, but the album, as well?      The Harmony Game was one of the most interesting, entertaining and informative documentary about the making of an album that I had seen in years.  This beats all of the VH1 Classic Albums documentaries, 5 of which I own, and they're great in their own right.  One section touched on the fact that the title track was initially planned to just have the two verses, driven home on piano.  I listened to the released track and tried to imagine it fading out after the piano and cymbal crash following the second verse.  I think it would have been beautiful just as that was, but it's the third verse that sends the listener into a tailspin, and it's a hell of a way to open an album.      I wouldn't say The Harmony Game is the only reason to get this set, but it's a great part of it, and I highly recommend it.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I find it humorous when I read the review I wrote for `Let Go' quite a while back.  In that review I mentioned how this album was a step up.  Well, upon a recent listen I've appended that statement since, well, it's not true.  As a whole `Under My Skin' is actually a step backwards from her initial album, serving up a lot more filler than necessary.  Thankfully she traded in some of her ways for a fresher sound (I still uphold that her third album is sublime) but `Under My Skin' frays towards the end to deliver an uneven album with a few goodies.<br /><br />So here it is, track for track.<br /><br />`Take Me Away' is a decent album opener, although it doesn't bring anything substantial to the table.  It showcases Avril's knack for pop/rock and the way she can nail a chorus and bring it all home, but there is something very dated about the tracks construction.  It doesn't age as well as some of her other tracks.  `Together' ages very well, standing up even today as one of her finer efforts.  The piano laden musical arrangement and Avril's vocals on the chorus are pitch-perfect.<br /><br />The angst-ridden `alternative-pop' scene does come over a tad `overdone' but remembering that this album was released during the genres heyday will help you appreciate what Avril attempts to accomplish here.<br /><br />`Don't Tell Me' was the album's first single, and it was a great choice.  I love the stripped down feel of the verses and then the `pure Avril' chorus kicks in with an added edge of earnestness.  Her vocals are distinct (like a younger, less refined Alanis Morissette) and they work marvelously here.  Sure, some of the lyrics seem simple and cheap, but she delivers them with a veneer of conviction that elevates the song.  It's still one of my favorite Avril songs.<br /><br />`He Wasn't' is one of the big issues I have with early Avril; she doesn't understand who she is as an artist.  The whole `let me pretend to be punk rock and release a vintage Green Dayesque record' just doesn't work with her.  The musical arrangement itself fees ripped straight from Green Day's `Insomniac' record.  `How Does It Feel' finds Avril trying to tap into the success of `I'm With You', slowing things down and trying to pull out a sincere and moving track that just doesn't do it.  It doesn't have the ghostly quality of `I'm With You', despite trying very hard to.  `My Happy Ending' was probably one of Avril's biggest hits; in fact they still play this one the radio often.  It is cheery in structure despite the downer-type message.  It is bouncy and catchy and fun.  `Nobody's Home' captures some of the eerie sincerity that `How Does It Feel' misses.  Sure, it isn't exactly the same breed of track, but it conveys the feelings that `How Does It Feel' couldn't.  Maybe that's because Avril vocals are better suited for `big' things.  She blends the slowed down appeal of a ballad with the up-tempo (if only slightly) quality of her vocal tones on the chorus.<br /><br />`Forgotten' works, sort of, but it certainly tries a little too hard.  `Who Knows' is bouncy and interesting yet it kind of feels like fluff.  `Fall to Pieces' is soft and underwhelming.  `Freak Out' is cheap and the musical arrangement is near plagiarism, but there is some sense of fun in the chorus.<br /><br />But thankfully the closing track, `Slipped Away', is everything it needed to be in order to really wrap things up well.  Her vocals are strong, the chorus hits the right notes and the haunting quality she had been striving for on some of the other tracks comes full circle here and actually accomplishes what she wanted to.<br /><br />In the end I can't say that I hate this album, despite the fact that a good 50% or more of it is subpar and doesn't age well.  I just have this soft spot for Avril, and when she hits her highs she really soars.  This isn't the best effort from her (the second half of this album is a steep and steady free-fall) but it is still worth a listen, or two.l arrangement itself fees ripped straight from Green Day's `Insomniac' record.  `How Does It Feel' finds Avril trying to tap into the success of `I'm With You', slowing things down and trying to pull out a sincere and moving track that just doesn't do it.

B004M17IUS|4.0|Please note this album review focuses on comparing the two CD editions and not reviewing the music.<br /><br />This classic 5 star Queen album came after the Night at the Opera and is a musically complimentary follow-on from that album with impeccable musicianship, outstanding compositions that vary from rocking,'Tie your Mother Down', heartfelt ballads like 'You take my breath away' to the anthem 'Teo Torriatte'.<br /><br />'Somebody To Love' is arguably the standout here although 'The Millionaire Waltz' is a close second with all that typifies Queen with radical dynamics from whispered cabaret to rocking it down with over-dubbed guitar and vocal extravaganza and climactic pounding drums all in one composition. This album exemplifies what Queen could do in the studio and is easily as musically rich as 'Night at the Opera'.<br /><br />I have bought the deluxe version which includes an extra EP with 5 additional tracks. I will refer to this later.<br /><br />Like the Queen 2 remaster, I do like the whole new Day at the Races 2011 package, but I find the sound quality improvements perhaps not as noticeable as what I did with the Queen 2 2011 remaster. (See my review '2011 Remaster compared to 1991 Queen 2, April 1, 2011'). The changes are very subtle - with the silences marginally quieter, the bass possibly more pronounced and the backing vocals more defined.<br /><br />What was noticeable is that when comparing the two versions, I had to turn down the 2011 remaster as the volume has been significantly lifted. Each time I thought how amazing a part of the track sounded on the 2011, I was surprised that when I raised the volume listening to 1994 remaster it sounded as good.<br /><br />Looking at the overall package the 1994 booklet compares favourably with the 2011 remaster and I could see no improvement in the photograph quality used other than in the 2011 remaster deluxe there are two additional photographs.<br /><br />So then, why would you purchase the new 2011 remaster? For Queen fans three of the five tracks on the bonus EP are extraordinary.<br /><br />The live version of 'Somebody to Love' at Milton Keyes Bowl 1982 has been hailed as the greatest version of this song and Freddie's vocals are powerful exhibiting all his control and live Freddy-isms. From a track showing his strength, we then go to his emotive best - the 1976 Hyde Park performance of 'You take my breath away'. This emotion drenched performance of Freddy alone on piano does take your breath away. I'm sure a few people will have a lump in their throat listening to this beautiful rendition...'so are you ready brothers and sisters' for a roller coaster ride of Mercury magic? Finally 'Teo Torriate' ends the EP in high definition multi-channel mix. Really impressive but it did make me desire the whole album to be available in 5.1 mix.<br /><br />So for Queen fans - it is worth the purchase. But for listeners who already have the 1994 remaster - you may wish to consider carefully whether it is worth the repurchase as the older 1994 remaster holds up as a pretty good recording.he bonus EP are extraordinary.

I can't fully endorse it and say 'go see it, you'll love it' to anyone, but there is literally no one today making films like this anymore.

B004J713JW|5.0|Having received my Blue-ray copy of this Shea Stadium concert I have listened to it 4 times and I must comment on it. The Video quality is exceptional and the production and editing as well. I have a JBL Studio matched speaker set-up in 7.1 consisting of a 3-way 150 watt center channel,250-watt 3-way floor standing,400 watt self-powered 12-inch front firing,3-way 175-watt side surround and 4-way 175 watt rear surround all connected with monster cable and powered by a 910 watt Yamaha 7.1 audio/video receiver. The only minor complaint with the audio is that it requires more power for higher sound amplitude than some of my top rated audio concert DVD's. The mix is well balanced with the vocals,drums,guitar,bass and supporting instrumentation distinct. For this I would rate 4 stars. Overall it's 5 stars. Don't listen to the Bad Audio review as This is a must own DVD designed to be cranked up!MR. \\"Bad Audio\\" is just an 'Angry Young Man'!

Mitchell has a flair for yanking the rug out from under the reader, and does not disappoint in CLOUD ATLAS.  It winds its way through six different stories that are interlocking - so it seems - first one way, then in reverse order.  A missionary on a less-than wholesome sea voyage, a British literary editor with high blood pressure, and a somewhat less-than-human fast-food worker are a few of the diverse denizens of these neighboring worlds.      If you've read Mitchell before, this book is much more tightly structured than GHOSTWRITTEN, but tries too hard in comparison to achieve a nested-doll structure and seems forced in how it connects one story to another.  Even so, the six stories are unique in voice and tone, all brilliantly created worlds and characters.  This is an especially great read if DeLillo is too heavy or dull for you.
B003UESJHO|3.0|I've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale for years. But seriously, I watched 45 minutes of the movie and wondered why I should empathize with these characters. I know it is supposed to be a dramatic movie, but I've seen episodes of soap operas that work better than this. The actors are amazing so I can't help but think there was something wrong with the direction of the film. Where's the passion? The first four Rocky movies as well as Cinderella Man brought it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is my favorite version of Jane Eyre! Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson absolutely captured the deep abiding love of Jane and Edward(Mr.Rochester):) I would recommend this DVD to all who love Romance!!!
B000ICXQHE|2.0|I am generally a loyal fan of heist films, and I like both Denzel Washington and Clive Owen. Thus, going into this film I had high hopes that it would be compelling and enjoyable. Unfortunately, I've been disappointed both times I've seen it. While there are a few good scenes and twists, the movie as a whole falls flat for me for several reasons:    SPOILER ALERT (to a point)    1) Brutalizing people to commit a crime that is in many ways about righting a wrong doesn't justify the wrong actions committed along the way.    2) Most of the characters were quite unsympathetic, including Owen. Even Washington wasn't especially watchable.    3) Washington, for being a hostage negotiator, displayed no particular skills at doing that, and in fact acted quite stupidly at one point in a manner that could have endangered all the hostages. That seemed highly unrealistic.    4) Jodie Foster, as some sort of master fixer, was not only pompous and smug (which she was intended to be), but also a bit laughable (esp. the bin Laden real estate deal). Too bad her role in the story couldn't have been done another way.    5) The super criminals who foil the cops at every turn routine gets much too trite after a point.    6) The \\"inside man\\" revealed at the end didn't have any clear role in the film, except perhaps to confuse? It wasn't apparent what his function was.    7) Overall, no performance struck me as one I wanted to see more of throughout the film. Too much mediocrity and almost silly writing.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|I really liked the series, it gave an interesting look to the cannon begging of star trek. Even though I was not a huge fan of the time travel arc, I must say that in general all the seasons were good, with the third being probably the best.    Regarding to the product, I must say that I liked the way the DVDs are packed, I guess they try to resemble elements of the NX-Class ship.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Love the Godfather. This collection item is great! Cannot get enough. I can sit down on any given day and watch these. Great buy. Must have for all the \\"Godfather\\" fanatics like myself.
0393338827|5.0|Mr. Lewis wrote \\"Liar's Poker\\". In this book, he discuss that the roots of the meltdown of 2008 - complex financial products like mortgage derivatives.     Mr. Lewis describes Wall Street firms \\"to hide the risk by complicating it\\". Moreover, their low quality bonds get triple A ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Why, he asks, \\"were Moody's and Standard & Poor's willing to bless 80 percent of a pool of dicey mortgage loans with the same triple-A rating they bestowed on the debts of the U.S. Treasury?\\" Because, he suggests, Wall Street firms knew how to game the system; they knew how to get the rating agencies to ineptly rate dangerous bonds.    The Big Short is not the story of the crisis, as the crisis is commonly understood. The failure of Lehman brothers and of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; the stock-market crash; the bail-out of Detroit; the fevered all-nighters pulled at Treasury and the New York Fed; the fears that the entire global financial system was on the brink of collapse -- little if any of that is in this book.( Felix Salmon)    It is obviously that the company's stock and bond it's published are trash if the company is not that good in the financial world.  This is simple logic that the value investment goes. But when it comes to the real move, it is really difficult to identifying whether a company is good or trash, especially in Wall Street where full of lies and greedy.     Money and greedy are the main drivers that financial institutions send loans crazily. It is such like the \\"leverage\\" which brought huge interest rate risk and credit risk to the financial institutions. People are greedy and we cannot get rid of our nature. That is why the market also goes between inflation and deflation as George Soros said. The Lehman Brother's fail would cause the bankruptcy of most of the banks in Wall Street if the government would not jump in than bail out. Even, the economy of the US would be collapse.     The whole process of Lehman's fail was notthat hard to understand. So do the stocks, bonds, long position and short position. That really hard are the complex financial derivatives, and the theories that they used to hedge their risk. I got a feeling that the Wall Street is combined of a crowd of genius who design a game of wealth together. And the purpose of the game is to try their best to rob the money of the player of the game. They overuse \\"leverage\\" to get this purpose. But when they move the game to the market, the game out of control and both the players and the creators of the game went collapse.     Actually, I really do not understand how deep the water is in the financial institutions and also the banks. Also, I do not know when the crisis will over neither. But as an individual investor, the book gave me two great points of concern which are the leverage of the company that you invest in and where their profit came from.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I've been wanting a second controller for quite a while. After lots of research and wait. I come to the conclusion that Amazon had the best pricing. It was delivered promptly and packed properly. Control has been functioning great and no issues. Use it about 5 hours a week and no problems thus far.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Enjoy watching the stars of this movie in other movies and the movie has it's cute moments, but it is a movie you will not want to watch over and over again.  It's a one and done movie.
B00406UK5A|4.0|It's not the best movie I've seen, however I liked it. Could have been done better. Too many times you hear the f* word in this movie, too many. And the battles are way too bloody. Scenes are unrealistic. Example: when a guy on the horse drags a man into a tree with his face, face breaks into pieces. Also a fault when a woman without tongue suddenly screams. In reality she wouldn't be able to scream. The battles may not be very realistic looking, but story is fine.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Didn't fit the culture! A lot of things in this movie never would have happened during this time in history. It was really too sensual for my liking. Poor acting- did not represent the true Austen characters. I like the A&E version where purity and love are glorified, not lust. A lot of nude paintings and sculptures in the show as well, so if for no other reason- I will not watch again.
B003WJRW2U|5.0|Regarding the subject matter of HTML5, I'll say that I have no complaints as this book pretty much represents everything I know about HTML5 (along with the O'Reilly book which I started but didn't finish). It covers the subject adequately as an intro, and if I want to get all pedantic I can follow the links and read the boring-as-life W3C specs.    What sets this book apart is a revolutionary approach, and I do not take the word \\"revolutionary\\" lightly, nor should you. The book is injected with humor. Goofy, juvenile humor (e.g. Hugh Jarce cited as an author in a piece of example code in reference to a fictional biography of J. Lo), but it does something that is absolutely essential. It keeps me awake. This may be the first book that hasn't caused me to have a narcoleptic episode within minutes of reading. Authors and publishers take note, it will not kill you to inject some humor into your technical writings.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|I expected a much better movie from Clint Eastwood who Produced and directed this film. One segment was in french all well and good if you speak french, might as well left that part out. Very slow moving story line boring could have been 60 minutes and then too long. So much bad about this movie do not wast your time with this one.
B004NGYXIM|5.0|Well it took me a few days to soak it all in, but now i can't get it out my head. WOW, is all i have to say.
B0047Y17P2|1.0|I love Michael Connelly's books. I bought your Kindle, Amazon, but I won't play your game any more. So I am currently reading The Fifth Witness in hardcover, which I got from the library. At $9.99, I'd have gotten it from you...  I'll also bet a nickel that \\"the publisher\\" is making the same amount of money from this in ebook format as they are from a hardcover. And for that matter, I'll bet they would likely take less if anything, because it cannot be nearly as easily lent to others. Hardbacks can be much more easily lent, then read for free and then lent, and...
B0041KKYEM|2.0|The Black Swan was... Unusual. I'd even possibly say unique, but not in a good way. I thought it was going to be a movie about a ballerina going insane, which I guess technically it was. Only I wouldn't use the term 'movie'. I suppose you could use the term 'Work of Art', but there are plenty of things out there you could call that and it wouldn't really mean much. Sure, it took a lot of effort and the performances were believable (which was very impressive). But the appeal was not there, not there at all. Which I found ironic, because by the end of the movie I found myself feeling much like the cranky (and apparently lecherous?) dance company owner guy. Like, um, this is impressive and all, but could you actually make it entertain me a little? Which it doesn't do. Not even a little. There were even some times when I laughed, but not so much because it was funny, but because it was just so weird it caught me off guard just how stupid of an idea some of the scenes were.    And anyway, we don't need anymore reminders that women are often not told they are perfect, no matter how close to it they are. And we certainly don't need to praise a film that basically says women who aren't perfect should jump off a cliff like their swan queen and bleed to death on a mattress.    This was really kind of terrible. I mean yeah, they did a good job making it and all. But it is nothing but sadness and evil. There is no light in this film at all. And the sex stuff was completely over the top, and very unnecessary. The extensive cussing in the dialogue was tacky too. It just didn't work, and I can't even begin to imagine why something so miserable would be called a film. This is like someone cutting their wrists and taping it for YouTube. Not kidding. I felt like I was watching a youtube video of someone cutting themselves. It was terrible. Unique, and at times even captivating. But not in a good way. I couldn't stop watching it until it was done, and yet every second of it made me feel worse about it. And worse about life!!    Be nice to the women in your life!!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Works great, no lag, great graphics on Galaxy tab, smooth interface. Need more games like this one. Wonderful change from the gazillion shooter games. Good job developer!
1582701709|3.0|I purchased the CD for The Secret after it was recommended to me. I listen to it in the car during my commute and am having fun pointing out to myself the way the author has taken various famous quotes out of context and abbreviated well-known theories to support her thesis. I find it interesting that Byrne co-opts String Theory to propose that one's \\"perfect\\" life already exists in the \\"nothingness\\" of the Universe.  Theoretically, yes, there are up to 10 parallel Universes out there.  Byrne's theory is that, through the power of thought, individuals can influence the course of events to jump the breech between these planes to pick and choose the outcomes they most desire in life from each dimension; in essence, \\"ordering from the catalog of the Universe\\" what they want.    If one is willing to suspend belief and invest in the emotional message of The Secret, the book/CD is positive and uplifting: exercise compassion, exercise positive thinking and express appreciation for beauty and you will begin to recognize compassion, positivity and beauty as it arises in your life. Many world religions teach this same exact message. Byrne simply re-frames it in an interpretation that some people may find more accessible.    In the end, no harm done, I say. Listening to The Secret reminds me to put positive vibes out into the universe, exercise gratitude and be graceful and gracious in accepting what happens in daily life. There can be no harm in that.
B004GYY714|5.0|Local stations pop right up, including HD radio feeds. Information on the stream bitrate and codec is interesting app. Pretty impressed overall. Radio station logos are a nice touch.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is a typical Foo Fighters album; in other words, 5 stars! This album rocks from beginning to completion with tight musicianship and memorable melodies. The verses are cryptic (as usual) but the choruses are catchy. There isn't anything new here from the Foos, but I don't wan't anything new from them! I enjoy their melding of Pop and Rock and consider them to be one of the last remaining great hard rock bands (who still feel current). Just like with AC/DC, I'm happy to buy the same great album over and over again! I recommend the Bestbuy version which has an additional great song.
B002LL13BQ|3.0|Opera is about the music, nothing else.  Libretto should be like the batter in a fruitcake, only just enough to hold all the good stuff together .. and all the good stuff is the music. Nothing should ever distract from the singing.  Carreras is his magnificent self here, and Scotto ..as Musetta! .. absolutely dazzles!  Stratas' voice is debatable but in any case lost in her behavior, very like a hummingbird on speed .. or a \\"looka me!\\" six year old determined to dominate the conversation.  What a pity Carreras could never have sung Boheme with Monserrat Caballe.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Ok, so I don't buy or download albums anymore, let alone buy the actual/physical CD.   But I had to snag this CD after seeing some live performances and sampling songs here on Amazon.   What a great album - truly one of the best rock albums I've heard in a long time.   Classic Foo Fighters - but some of these songs are INSTANT classics in general.    Really impressive release here - some truly great tunes.   Throw it in the car, or download/play on your mp3 device and CRANK IT LOUD!  Love it!
B0031TZAHU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book (as did most of my bookclub).  It had a lot of similarities to \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" by Kate Morton but I preferred this book by far.  Lots of family secrets, flashbacks and a nice twist at the end.  Great entertainment value.
B000W94FE6|2.0|just finished this book. the good news: it introduces a useful concept in the first few pages. unfortunately the author derives from that a right to dump a neverending, enormously tedious lecture on life, the universe and everything on the reader. EVERYTHING is somehow FLOW. And even what isn&#34;t is written in so that the reader may benefit from the authors immense wisdom and worldliness. I paced through 80% of this drivel hoping to find something original. No such luck. Get the journal article this came from, and skip the stuffing that stretches it into a book. Or buy the book and suffer through hours of misery and boredom. You have been warned.
1933771690|4.0|There has been a rather large volume of books in the past two or so decades dealing, one way or another, with the philosophical implications of the so-called New Physics (a term that refers mostly to Quantum Mechanics). The central thesis of most of these efforts has been, more or less, the idea that consciousness and the observer are not, shall we say, innocent bystanders in the great scheme of things, but actual participants. The level  of participation implied varies, with some authors allowing, often timidly, a certain degree of influence, while others boldly claim that without consciousness not only do we not have physics, but we do not actually have anything. Nothing at all. Robert Lanza and his book can be found in this latter category.    The book is well-written, with very easy-flowing language that is both easy to follow but also engaging. Lanza is not afraid to be humorous (when you reach the \\"George Clooney\\" comment you'll see what I mean), but also to include some personal details - that not only are not a digression, but, in a way, they are central to this narrative. At the same time, there is a very logical, coherent progression of his thesis. I think one of the most successful aspects of the book is that it should be enjoyable by readers of very different backgrounds. People who have never heard of quantum mechanics before, will not have any problem whatsoever following the arguments presented, as it's all explained, briefly and in a simple language - diagrams are also included. At the same time, people who have read about the topic before, will surely find new elements to stimulate their thought. Yes, all the \\"QM stuff\\" are there - double split, delayed choice, entanglement - but at no point did I feel bored or not the target audience.    So, what are the downsides of this book? What keeps it from being perfect? It is subtle, not easy to describe, but it is there. Perhaps in an attempt to underline the scientific scope of the book, Lanza treats philosophy as some kind of byproduct of thought that needs to be marginalized. It's not that he is too cold or emotionless - the exact opposite, rather; the text is full of emotion and passages from the works of such giants as Emerson and Thoreau. But, in my opinion, he could have ventured to be just a little more speculative. He does have a few pages near the end of the book in which some rather weak attempts at speculation are offered, but they are too meek.     In addition, I found two rather important omissions from a discourse on consciousness:  a) Ethics  b) Distinction between consciousness and identity    With regard to the former, I found it very puzzling and somewhat disappointing that ethics were not mentioned at all, and the relevant issue of free will is mentioned once, maybe twice, as fleeting and insignificant references. With regard to the latter, I got the impression that Lanza felt that such a task would be too daunting. But, alas, I was again left with a sense of incompleteness, for the notion of, shall we say, \\"My-consciousness-versus-your-consciousness\\" is crucial, and absolutely central. As far as I'm concerned, Amit Goswami's approach - in the style of \\"we don't 'have' consciousness; consciousness 'has' us\\" remains a pretty good starting point.    Having said that, I found Lanza's work extremely rewarding and thought-provoking, and I would warmly recommend it. It is truly a part of the paradigm-shift literature of our times.
067182449X|5.0|Under normal circumstances a diary written by a teen-age girl might not have much significance.  However, when the author writes her diary while hiding from oppressive forces occupying her country the diary has a much richer and lasting meaning.  Such is the case with Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.  Between 1942 and 1944 Anne kept a diary as her family and another family were hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam.  Anne is very good at using description in her writing and utilizes the power of understatement quite effectively; she also is skilled at using short, crisp dialogue to liven up the various scenes she describes.  Despite her difficult circumstances she is able to maintain an optimistic outlook on life.  Though the reader can never quite shake the bitterness of knowing young Anne's life will end, there are pertinent and delightful coming of age themes explored throughout her writing; some of these themes include conflict with parents and young love.  Anne's writing definitely develops and matures during the course of the diary.  While this book calls the reader to not forget the Holocaust it also serves as a celebration of the vitality of youth.
B004NDVJJG|5.0|Received this album upon first release (Apr 14).  Having the two previous albums, both excellent (Summertime and Trio ), i was expecting a similar genre of cerebral and intensely musical jazz interactions among these 3 talented players.  And, that's exactly what i got .... cerebral, smooth but sometimes intense interplay.The whole album held together beautifully.  This group has a bright future.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The only thing I kept thinking after viewing this DVD is that we are screwed. This was a calculated plan to remove the regulations that were in place to restrict the underhanded, immoral practices of Wall Street which caused the first collapse. This plan, conceived by the bankers and enacted by our elected officials in Washington has worked to perfection. As one of the \\"former\\" middle class it was truly enlighting to see how this came about and put faces to the players involved. We the taxpayers have bailed out just about everybody and have gotten nothing but higher taxes and more corruption in government, but we do have more billionaires! We are well and truly screwed!
B002EC3932|5.0|Having seen the Historicity concert on tour, i knew pretty much what to expect in creativity and quality.  Great piano poly-rhythmic skills on the part of  Vijay Iyer...he is a brilliant artist with a brilliant cast....Marcus Gilmore, a very talented drummer (and grandson of Roy Haynes) and Stephan Crump, a great bass player.  I really appreciated 'Galang' (Trio Riot Version), typical of Vijay Iyer's style and talent.
B000005J56|5.0|If you're unsure of what good music is, buy this. It's so good, you wont have to worry about skipping anything.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This album presents an interesting mix of styles:  - \\"classic\\" Foo Fighters: I'm thinking of the amazing \\"Bridge Burning\\" (opener), \\"Rope\\" or \\"White Limo\\". The powerful drumming, Dave Grohl's singing and the big riffs will make this album an instant classic. Honestly, some of the tracks are so good I can listen to them non-stop for hours...  - Some tracks are pretty catchy, and that might be a problem for some people. I'm thinking of \\"Back and Forth\\" or \\"Arlandria\\"  (which, unfortunately, is at times reminiscent of some Bon Jovi tunes from the 80's... OK that's a bit too harsh).  Of course, as always, you have to let some of the songs grow on you.    Note that with Butch Vig producing, Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear guest-starring, this album definitely has a subtle Nirvanesque flavor (\\"White Limo\\", \\"A Matter of time\\", \\"I should have known\\").    Bottom line: This is already my favorite Foo albums. Go for it, you won't be disappointed.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over and over.  Can't get enough of it.  The acting and singing were both great.  You won't be disappointed.  You will want to buy the soundtrack once you see the movie.  Make sure you buy the soundtrack that has the singers from the movie and not the original artists.  Once you listen to the soundtrack and see the movie, then someone please tell me why Garrett Hedlund is not singing country music.
0470449764|5.0|Everything went very good! The product is just what I expected. It's a book to get into an MBA or a major consulting firm.
0670022411|1.0|Hands down the worst book I've ever encountered.     Spoilers if you read on.    The witch and the vampire are in love, which is forbidden.  However, nearly the entire book reads like this:  Matthew: You're so beautiful, Diana.  Diana: You're so handsome, Matthew.  Matthew: But you're so brave, too!  Diana: Don't you forget it!  I won't leave your side, Matthew, no matter the danger!  Matthew: You're so beautiful, and so brave!  [Repeat this dialogue until it goes beyond tedious, well into fingers-on-the-blackboard territory.]  Matthew leaves for a while.  Diana pines for Matthew.  Diana sits in a chair.  Diana takes a nap.  Diana eats.  Diana frets.  Diana doubts herself.  Diana has something to eat. Diana frets.  Matthew comes back!  Matthew: You're so beautiful!  Diana: You're so handsome!  I missed you!      Seriously - it's mostly pages and pages of trite dialogue, interspersed with cliches and platitudes between the two main characters. There are almost no plot developments the entire way through the book.  There's a bit of plot development in the beginning, and a bit at the end, with the hope that you'll buy the second book in the trilogy.  At one point I thought that maybe this is a romance novel, but I'm thinking it doesn't even qualify as that.  I don't read romance novels, but I'm guessing romance novels have a bit of plot and probably some sex instead of endless fawning dialogue between two characters.  I shouldn't have finished this book, but frankly I was flabbergasted that it could maintain the consistent awfulness from start to finish.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|I love the series. I love Bella and Edward. I liked Jacob. I loved reading the books. I loved feeling like I was in Forks. I loved the first three books. I was SO disappointed in Breaking Dawn that I stopped reading it right after the gross scene after they get married. It took me forever to even want to finish reading it, but I finally did and I was so disappointed. it's like a bad fantasy with Twilight characters in it. I mean really did Edward who is all crazy protective of Bella offer to share her with Jacob? Did Edward call Jacob brother? What universe is this supposed to happen in cause it's not Twilight. it's not that it's like a fanfic it's that it's like a really BAD fanfic. The names are the same but it's not the same characters that I read about and loved for hundreds of pages. Oh well at least there's the first three books...
B00466HN68|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  It begins with a train traveling around Chicago and some beautiful scenery.  Sean wakes up and is acting weird.  He doesn't recognize Christina, the girl he is with, or where he is at.  He is NOT Sean, he is Captain Coulter Stevens and was in Afghanistan.  Now he is on a train in the U.S.  (What the heck?)  Although it sounds bizarre, there is a bomb on the train!  Captain Stevens is in a controlled experiment, being sent to this train.  He has exactly 8 minutes to find the bomb and the bomber before the train blows just outside of Chicago.  The Controllers of the experiment have the ability to send the Captain back in 8 minute clips until he finds the bomb and bomber.<br /><br />This is a movie about stretching the imagination and about parallel time dimensions, time-reassignment to an alternate reality that is \\"ahead\\" in time.  Jake xxx does a great job as Captain Stevens.  I found the movie very interesting and entertaining and I loved the ending.  I plan to buy the video as soon as it is available.
B002RL7W9W|4.0|Bought as a birthday gift for grandson. He likes legos and I think they help with small motor skills and creative construction skills. Goes along with other lego products and good alternative to electronic devices.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Quit whining about the price. I get the books on my Kindle for two reason. First, my Kindle is much more convenient to use than lugging a hard cover book around. Second, it weighs a hell of a lot less. I think the publishers are out of line, but I am overpaying for lots of thins since BO became President.    But about this book. I couldn't put it down to go to bed. It was definitely up to Connolly's standard. I can hardly wait to hear about Haller's new career. It will be interesting to see the reaction of the prosecutor in this case.
0060989157|5.0|Best tell-all book I've ever read!  These guys were honest and extremely interesting.  Fascinating how complex and sad \\"success\\" is once you attain it.  Couldn't put it down!  Great read!!  Highly recommend it for Motley Crue fans!
B003VB5E2E|5.0|BB King once said: Eric Clapton is the sweetest and the most gentle guy in the music business. Not only for all he did (and does) for musicians and people who need assistance to deal with drugs/alchool addiction, but also for the chance he provides to many musicians to be introduced to huge audiences. For example, just have a look at the blond girl that appears playing guitar on Crossroads 2007 (extras on DVD 2). Her name is Orianthi Panagaris. She was asked to be in the band with the \\"King Of Pop\\", MJ, for the concerts in the O2 Arena (as we all know, those concerts sadly never happened). Second DVD in this pack (Crossroads 2010) is the best one, if you are really a blues guitar fan. Eric and Steve Winwood delivers the best version of \\"Voodoo Child\\" (slow version) that I've ever seen. Hopefully there are chances of another one in 2013. Let's wait!
0307463745|1.0|This book was a huge waste of time. Its boring to start off with, but thats not the worst part.  The worst part is that the book is basically a collection of ramblings from arrogant authors who think that the way they do things is always the best way to do things.  Some of their insights might be practical for a software development company, but have little applicability outside of that field.  Don't bother wasting your time or money on this book.
0316044938|1.0|I had high hopes for this one, but I just couldn't finish it. The pacing was so inconsistent, that I found myself bored and skimming whole pages. What started with impact fizzled too quickly and my attention wandered, ultimately leaving me with a strong sense of detachment - I couldn't feel anything for the characters or their situation anymore, not even for Susie, the victim of a horrible rape and murder. In the end, I wasn't willing to keep plodding through it, so I put it down about halfway through. This definitely wasn't the read for me.<br /><br />Note: Since writing the above review, I have read other reviewers, here and on Goodreads, who did finish the book and provided spoilers for the ending. I am relieved that I didn't make it that far because that type of ending would have left me feeling angry and disgusted. I am so glad I didn't stick around long enough for all that.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|When I graduated High School in 1980 WWII vets were mostly guys in their late 50's and 60's, a little younger than my grandparents. Now as they vanish from the scene what a privilege it was to come alongside one of those great men and here his story first hand via my very 21st century Kindle. Although I was never in combat and served in a Corps 30 years removed from that great war, I recognized his descriptions of Esprit de Corps, drill instructors, training and discipline.
0765326353|5.0|I came into this book very cautious, I had never read anything from Sanderson before but since he is finishing WOT I figured he must be pretty good.   I have to admit I absolutely loved this book... I also have the audio book version. (Read by Michael Kramer, same guy as WOT audio books.) And I will say it's the best new book to a brand new series I've read in a very long time.
0804115613|4.0|I ended up stumbling across this book last summer at my local library when I was looking for something else. Curious, I picked up the book and read it when I visited the beach later that week. I am so glad I picked up and read it. It is well done and isn't too difficult to follow with all the place/time/character changes. Well worth your time to read this book.
B004LUS390|5.0|I went in expecting something I could sketch with on the go and so far it's delivered - really great tools for such a small package, it comes off deceptively simple but in the right hands you can do a lot of great stuff. Some of my favorite features are how easy it is to import photos, the layer tool, as well as a lot of control over drawing tools (width, opacity, etc., everything you'd expect in a desktop drawing suite). The interface is also really intuitive, and I was able to do some good drawing after about 10 minutes of playing with all the tools. All in all, does what it says and the price is good.
1439102724|5.0|After reading one of Jodi Picoult's book I am always looking forward to reading another one and also wanting to talk about her books with a willing listener. After reading My Sister's Keeper I knew that if all her books were written that same way, I would forever be a fan. The formula that she has is flawless: pick a topic that get's people talking (no matter how controversial, although the more it is the better I think), create characters that are all different (I don't know how she does it but its wonderful), and BAM, a story that is mesmerizing and has the reader thinking how could this possibly end?<br /><br />As soon as I read a synopsis of the story, I just knew that it was going to be a tough one. Not because I sway either way, but how do you touch on the topic of sexuality, religion, AND law in the same book? It's all messy and I couldn't see how it could turn out good at all. Picoult does a wonderful job of delicately introducing the reader to what will be a constant struggle for same sex couples and homosexual/transgender people, while hinting that there is a light at the end of the tunnel; change will come.

B002OSY2T6|3.0|This is such a cute toy on the shelf...get it home and all it really does is light up and play music if it's touched/batted...this worked well to entice my daughter for tummy time at the beginning because she didn't like tummy time...it still entices her at 6/7 months, but I thought this was something that moved on it's own...it doesn't it only rolls after being pushed.  Also, as far as durable goes - my dad majorly scratched it getting it out of the box because it was stuck in there...
B0017XFBMG|5.0|I know what your thinking.  Is is worth the money?  If you are a true Pogues fan the answer is definitely YES!  If you are just a casual fan of The Pogues there are plenty of \\"Best Of\\" compilations for you to choose from out there.  The Pogues Box Set IS NOT a best of compilation, but it is an incredibly wonderful collection of the most rarest of Pogues tracks.  Well produced and well worth the extra cash.    I have all of The Pogues albums (except for Red Roses and the last two without Shane McGowan).  Buy this box set. You won't be disappointed!  I had no idea there were so many great Pogues gems that never made it on their albums.  The production value is also a HUGE PLUS!  There are at least 3 Pogues albums worth of stuff you've probably never heard of before.    Reasons to buy this box set:    1.  \\"NW3\\"  Arguably one of the BEST Pogues songs I've ever heard!  2.  All the different demo's of \\"Fairytale Of New York\\" simply fabulous!  I love Demo #2 BETTER THAN the one with Kristy MacColl! (and I love Kristy MacColl's voice)  3.  Unreleased songs of The Pogues with Kristy MacColl  (all 3 of them) are terrific, especially \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\" and \\"Tears That I've Cried\\"  4.  The 12 inch version of \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" is AWESOME!  5.  There are countless demos and outtakes from \\"Hells Ditch\\" and \\"Red Roses...\\" which are fabulous.  (Just check out: \\"The Black Dogs Ditch\\" and \\"The Last Of McGee\\" that were cut from Hells Ditch).  6.  The demos from \\"Red Roses\\" and \\"Peace and Love\\" are in my opinion better than what you get on the actual albums, especially the demos from \\"Red Roses..\\"  7.  I Love the covers: \\"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" \\"Do You Believe In Magic\\" and \\"Maggie May\\" and I never cared for Rod Steward's music but when Shane sings it, it's so much better!  8.  Demo of \\"Haunted\\" from The Sid and Nancy soundtrack is terrific!  9.  Awesome production value on the 3 live songs with Joe Strummer. In the past they were only available on bootleg and didn't have decent production value.   10.  Liner notes, packaging, and booklet are fabulous with many great stories of The Pogues!    All you Pogues fans will be happy with this Pogues box set.  Trust me there's no buyers remorse with this set of treasures!

You can read Connellys Haller books in any order and he brings you up to date very quickly so you know who every body is and the history of the characters and Mickey's past involvements.

B001C4CI8U|4.0|I am a new viewer to this television series. I started watching it recently on TV and was a bit lost by all the references to peripheral agendas, but I found it fascinating. I then rented the earlier seasons to get the background I had missed. If you too are new to it I recommend viewing all the series. Fans of [[ASIN:B000BOH986 The X-Files: The Complete First Season]] and other unusual SciFi series should find it to their liking. It has the feel of cross between abnormal science cases with a bit of a secret organization operating in the background experiamenting on humans. I recommmend it. If you enjoy it, be sure to see [[ASIN:B001D2WUGG Primeval: Volume 1 (Series 1 and 2)]].<br /><br />CA Luster

0240815807|5.0|Having read most of Mike Seniors Mix Rescue articles in Sound on Sound magazine, I kind of knew what to expect with this book - it is absolutely packed with top tips for audio probelm solving, getting the most from your environment and equipment and general advice on various areas that all small studio owners will be familiar with. Its extremely well written, very approachable and Mike has a way of putting across his point that has you thinking \\" oh yeah, i never thought of that...\\"    I would approach this book almost as a course - you need to read a bit and then put it into practice to get the most out of it. The online resources are excellent, giving you audio examples and files to use on your own DAW.     I think that this book, along with Bob Katz Mastering Audio and David Miles Huber Modern Recording Techniques, is going to become a go-to book for students, semi-pros and pros in the future.    An excellent book!    dk

B00008YJHC|3.0|BOSSANOVA, released in 1990, was the third album by the Pixies. Musically it continues the style of their previous release DOOLITTLE: a harsh tone matched to lush production, surf-rock allusions, lead vocals by Frank Black with all his weird lyrics and most songs lasting well under 3 minutes.<br /><br />The instrumental \\"Cecilia Ann\\" is a fine opener, two minutes of power chords. \\"Rock Music\\" introduces Frank Black's vocals, but it's a bit of self-parody, as his hoarse screaming is unintelligible. \\"Velouria\\" is the sort of Pixies song that invites singing along. \\"The Happening\\" has an unusual amount of variety for a song from this band, with<br /><br />I find BOSSANOVA slightly less memorable than its predecessor. The group was getting a little too polished and technically proficient at this point, and the passionate DIY vibe which somehow persisted through DOOLITTLE is missing here. Still, this is an entertaining enough album.

B001K98MFU|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest cyber-fiction stories period; I tend to think of Ghost in the Shell and Blade Runner as the two works that define science fiction cinema for me. Mamoru Oshii is as big a figure in my personal pantheon, as fundamental as Phillip K. Dick and Frank Herbert. I am a long-time fan of the GitS manga, the anime, and especially the two parallel universe movies (of which 'Innocence' is the second). That being said, there are more than enough reviews of these works, and I don't need to add yet another. This review is my soapbox, and I plan to rain as much fire and brimstone on Amazon as a can, so bear with me.     Gripe the First: amazon seems unable to separate the reviews of the DVD version of this movie from the reviews of the Blu-Ray. Partly to blame are foolish users posting in the wrong place, partly to blame are the people that manage this site. That can't be that hard, not even for even a database novice; it seems to show a lack of concern on the part of the management.     Gripe the Second: This is really my primary gripe. At the time of writing this review, amazon is only offering copies through 'amazon re-sellers',  and the list price for a \\"new\\" copy is $90+, and for \\"used\\" it's $70+. Seems like someone is trying to artificially inflate the average price for these items, and hose-down the rest of us. These are not out-of-print or rare collectibles; again, someone in management seems asleep at the wheel. This item is still being printed and sold for less than a third of these prices everywhere else on the internet. You might say, \\"well, just go somewhere and buy the copy for less,\\" and I plan to, but not before I say my peace. I could be paying a reasonable price for one of my favorite films on Blu-Ray here at amazon, along with the rest of my order, but I'm being forced to go use other websites that I don't prefer. Hopefully, someone at amazon takes notice.     This Blu-Ray, and the movie itself both get 5 stars, but amazon gets abig fat ZERO. GG.
0446678430|4.0|I am avid read of Rich Dad Book series and have read the other popular series like the Rich Dad Poor Dad, Guide to Investing, CashFlow etc. This book contains a good summary of all the wisdom of other books put in a nutshell.<br /><br />The book also mention on the Options Vs Stocks which I really liked. There is not much details about it on Options but gives one of the most simplest explanation on benefiting over trends ( Options ) than owning the stock. Rightly said, Rich people control everything but own nothing and Roberts shows with good  real examples.<br /><br />Not the book to start understanding what Robert is trying to explain, but if you want to refresh all the concepts its a good read.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|Really like this show.  At first I just started watching it because he has such pretty eyes and it is a cop show with a twist.  But by the end I really was enjoying it and thinking when I was going to buy season 2.

B004DMAZQK|4.0|Uk-based trio White Lies released an intruiging (and much hyped in the UK) debut album \\"To Lose My Life\\" in 2009, which debuted at No. 1 in the UK album charts. After extensive touring now comes the second, much anticipated, sophomore album.<br /><br />\\"Rituals\\" (10 tracks; 50 min.) starts off with \\"Is Love\\", which immediately grabs you even though it takes a bit for the song to fully explode. And we are off! \\"Strangers\\" is an equally appealing song (and obvious candidate for a single release), with up-tempo drums and underlying synthesizers. But wait! There is more! \\"Bigger Than Us\\" (first UK single) follows, and brings the band to full glory. The song is an irresistable, arena-sized stomper when it gets to the chorus, just wow. It is the best track of the album for me. Just those first three songs are worth buying the album, period. But the good tracks continue, dark and brooding and huge. The second half of the album opens with \\"Holy Ghost\\", which I just love. Things get a little less interesting towards the album, but I must tell you that I've been playing the album pretty much non-stop since getting it a few weeks ago.<br /><br />In all, this is clearly a step up from the debut album, and one of the best albums I've heard this year, just great. I had the good fortune of catching the band live last Fall when they were opening up for Kings of Leon, and it is clear this band is going places. \\"Ritual\\" sounds like it was made to be played in big arenas and I have no doubt that's where this band is going eventually, headlining arenas instead of opening for the likes of Kings of Leon. Highly recommended!
B004B4RCDE|3.0|* S&M *<br /><br />Went to #3 in the singles chart.<br /><br />The name says it all really, so I won't explain the lyrics any further. I will say the lyrics themselves are very simple and highly repetitive, so they get stuck in your head. Pair these catchy lyrics with a energetic Euro dance/pop beat and I'm hooked.<br /><br />Some stations have renamed the song 'Come On' and bleep out many parts of it. Why can Kings Of Leon boast that their sex is on fire, but if Rihanna uses the word \\"sex\\" it gets bleeped? \\"Whips\\" and \\"chains\\" are another two words that are too extreme for listeners ears on radio/TV, so you really need to hear the album version to appreciate the song minus bleeps and muting effects.<br /><br />[As much as I love this version, I'll point that she's just released a killer remix of S&M, featuring a extra verse sung by a autotune free Britney Spears, which is miles better then this]<br /><br />* What's My Name? [featuring Drake] *<br /><br />Went to #1 in the singles chart.<br /><br />The lyrical content of the song has been as \\"sassy\\" and as being \\"[what] lyrically amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings\\". There's not much I can think of adding for this track; It's not terrible, but it's certainly not special either. It reminds me too much of 'Only Girl (In The World), but with none of it's charm and sensuality. After hearing \\"Oh na na, what's my name?\\" a few times, you'll be screaming \\"It's f***ing Rihanna\\"...<br /><br />Oh; Drake's rap contains the lines \\"I heard that you're good with those soft lips, you know word-of-mouth?\\" and \\"the square root of 69 is eight, right?\\", which caused a mini scandal in the U.S. apparently. Are your ears burning?<br /><br />* Cheers (Drink To That) *<br /><br />This track features a looping guitar groove that interpolates Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm With You\\".<br /><br />It's the weekend, so it's time to head to the bar and... that's it. I waited for this track to go somewhere in vain, as it seems to be building up for a thumbing chorus. It has simple lyrics like 'S&M', but the music doesn't suit the track at all - it needed the same club beats to give it some life. Oh - Avril's looped \\"yeah, yeahhh\\" winds the hell out of me. This is the track I've played the least.<br /><br />It seems that I'm in the minority however; Rihanna asked her fans to vote for the track they wanted to have as the third single [S&M won] and this came in second.<br /><br />* Fading *<br /><br />Interestingly for a feisty break-up song, this samples Enya's \\"One by One\\".<br /><br />After the three songs which have louder, shouty lyrics we see Rihanna turn it down a notch. It's not lyrically exciting - she's telling her partner she's bored, so he can go bye-bye - but they're catchy. Paired with her ever growing vocals, confident delivery and the piano lead, Enya infused music this track is lifted up a level.<br /><br />* Only Girl (In The World) *<br /><br />Went to #1 on the singles chart.<br /><br />At first I didn't like the single as it's lyrically needy; basically the song is about Rihanna reminding her partner to give her his attention and the video is cheesy and cheap looking. But when I really paid attention to the lines of the chorus I realised that the lyrics are actually upbeat, confident and sensual. Musically it's very Euro pop, with synths and a heavy bass line.<br /><br />The result is like a cross between 'Don't Stop The Music' and 'Rude Boy'.<br /><br />* California King Bed *<br /><br />Here we get a bit of a throw-back to the 'Good Girl Gone Bad' era with an acoustic ballad. There are two ways in which I interpret the lyrics:<br />1) She is in a long term relationship and is bemoaning the distance between her and her partner.<br />2) Her relationship has grown stale and there is an emotional distance between her and her partner.<br /><br />Even though I'm not sure how to interpret the lyrics they are solid and emotive. I can see this being released as a single, but there is nothing new or catchy here so this fails to interest me.<br /><br />* Man Down *<br /><br />Rihanna apologizes for shooting down a guy; after all \\"he could have been somebody's son\\" (no s**t Sherlock). I'll go ahead and assume that she means he came on to her and she turned him down, rather than imagining her as a T-1000.<br /><br />The lyrics are accompanied by Island-vibe infused R&B, which makes it stand out from the other tracks on LOUD.<br /><br />Like with 'California King Bed', this is an overall solid song, but it just doesn't interest me in the slightest.<br /><br />* Raining Men [featuring Nicki Minaj] *<br /><br />Was added to U.S. radio playlists in December 2010, but didn't get hugely positive feedback.<br /><br />Not only does it share it's title with the camptastic single by The Weather Girls, but it shares a similar theme - basically Rihanna is hot and savvy, so the men are practically raining down around her. Rihanna has described the track as \\"quirky and funny\\", but I think \\"cheesy and egotistic\\" is more accurate.<br /><br />I don't like Nicki Minaj or rap in general, so maybe I'm not the best person to be rating this track, but I don't think that she adds anything to the song; Her rap is just there to reinforce the previous lyrics, not to add to them.<br /><br />* Complicated *<br /><br />The lyrics and down-tempo R&B beats to 'Complicated' reminds me slightly of 'Fading'; but instead of saying her partner can up and go she's saying that she's going to hang in there, in the hope that he realises what he's going to lose if he doesn't change.<br /><br />Even though it is similar to another track on this album I still play this a lot and would like this to be a single, as the possibility for remixes is intriguing.<br /><br />* Skin *<br /><br />Another slower R&B number and it's again acoustically lead. The lyrics are basically her saying that being naked is good, so lose the shirt and jeans, but her seductive purr and the guitar riffs are very appealing.<br /><br />This is another track that has interesting single possibilities.<br /><br />* Love The Way You Lie (Part II) [featuring Eminem] *<br /><br />The original went to #2 on the singles chart.<br /><br />Best described as a sequel to 'Love the Way You Lie', this time with Rihanna as the lead vocalist, viewing a abusive relationship from the woman's point of view. The music for this version was bare; Only a piano and drums are used.<br /><br />The lyrics come of as being very personal and autobiographical, so I was surprised that Rihanna didn't write it. Eminem must have written the two versions with her in mind, I guess. Speaking of Eminem; He has one brief verse this time, the last verse. The whole song had slowly been building up mo mention, so his delivery seems savage and is very effective.<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - - -<br />Worth buying?<br />- - - - - - - - - - - -<br /><br />LOUD was produced to be an album full of potential singles, one of the executive producer's even compared the album to Micheal Jackson's Thriller...<br /><br />Whilst LOUD is never going to reach that goal there is only one 'filler' [Cheers] on here, so it's pats on the back all round. Half of the songs on LOUD aren't to my taste personally, there is a variety of styles present and so there is something for almost everyone on here. Rihanna was rumoured to have hired a vocal coach prior to recording LOUD and after listening to this it does seem plausible; Her best vocals are on this album, so there are clear signs of growth on both her song choices and vocals as she continues her one-year-between-albums trend.<br /><br />In short; although LOUD is a solid album, I find it similar to Good Girl Gone Bad in that I skip over several tracks as they're not to my taste and I consider Rated R to be her best album.\\" (no s**t Sherlock).

B004CGUC06|5.0|\\"Amarcord\\" is one of my favorite films. I fell in love with it on it's initial release and have rewatched it many times since. My love for this film has not diminished and the blu-ray is a big improvement over my well-used VHS copy. Nino Rotta's music still makes me smile. The quirkyness of the story, the absurdities, the surrealism, the pathos are beautifully captured by Criterion.     While there are fart jokes, they don't dominate the film. These boys don't seem any different than boys in America. The film is so much more. The idocy of Fascism, the structure of school, quirky charcters, boyhood fantasies, love, family, loss, magic. If you want to see something different, don't judge, just sit back and let Fellini cast his spell.
B003TML0VO|3.0|I bought this on impulse expecting some great tribute music. Otherwise, why would Carolos Santana do such an album? Unfortunately, it reminds me of covers of old hits by bar bands who are out of their league. Nothing is bad and the music is decent background, but there is little beyond mediocre. I am sure Santana had fun with this, but it should have stayed at home. I give it a generous three stars, but wonder if it is just out of respect for Carlos Santana.

0756404738|5.0|I finished reading some days ago this second part of the \\"Kingskiller Chronicles\\".<br />This second part starts with an essencial advantage, we already known Kvote, and just with this fact, we are looking foward to start reading the new story. Rothfuss goes on with his master writing, with his habitual espressions -a matter of fact- that makes me smiles more than once. Globally, the book is as good or better than the first one, if we make an exception with some small parts that were a bit slow for me -Kvotes staying in the Felurian Forest as an example-. I can say that those who enjoyed with \\"The Name of the Wind\\" will also enjoy with \\"The Wiseman Fear\\".<br /><br />Termin&eacute; hace unos d&iacute;as esta segunda parte de las cr&oacute;nicas del \\"asesino de reyes\\" (kingskiller chronicles). Se puede traducir como \\"El temor de un hombre sabio\\",  aunque yo lo traducir&iacute;a como \\"Los miedos de un hombre sabio\\" porque como se indica en el propio libro; hay tres cosas que todo hombre sabio debe temer: una tormenta en alta mar, la ira de un caballero y una noche sin luna. (Adem&aacute;s de ser una traducci&oacute;n libre lo estoy haciendo de memoria, pero la idea es la que he puesto).<br /><br />Dicho esto, esta segunda entrega parte con una ventaja esencial con respecto a la primera: ya conocemos a Kvote, y solo con esto ya estamos deseando empezarla. Routhfuss sigue escribiendo magistralmente, con algunas coletillas propias como \\"a matter-of-fact\\" que me hicieron sonre&iacute;r. En general el libro es tan bueno o mejor que el primero, salvo algunas partes que se me hicieron un pel&iacute;n pesadas, como la estancia del protagonista en el Bosque de Felurian. Salvando esto, puede decir que a quien le haya gustado \\"El nombre del Viento\\" seguir&aacute; disfrutando con \\"The Wiseman's fear\\".<br /><br />Una cosa m&aacute;s antes de finalizar la rese&ntilde;a: me ha recordado mucho a D. Quijote, en el sentido de que la novela no es una historia, sino muchas historias transversales a la principal... muy curioso.<br /><br />Valoraci&oacute;n: Muy buena.
6305882592|5.0|This is a story about a morose kid named Harold who has a fascination with death and a peppy senior named Maude who loves life. They meet at a funeral and form a bond that turns into a love story of sorts that transforms Harold's outlook. The key here is that the acting is top notch and HAROLD & MAUDE does for death what MASH did for medics in a war zone. Of course, that simplifies the real point that the film makes. It shows how a relationship can evolve and transform a person's life.<br />I like this film a lot because it is not only funny, but it reflects what film makers were doing in the '70's. It's point of view and sense of humor reflects the trend toward black comedy that was so prevalent then and still continues.
B002ZG99ZO|5.0|i have to say, i had some pretty 'HIGH' (ya know, cuz of the drugs) expectations for this movie. idk if it was cuz i like james franco, or because i loved pineapple express, but i was super excited to see this movie. i have to say, i was laughing hysterically throughout the entire film. from the opening credits, all the way until the 'i was just about to finish thinking of you' line at the end. personally, idk what u r thinking if u didnt like this movie. maybe if ur seeing it with ur parents or something, that might not b enjoyable. or, if ur like 80. if ur 80 this movie is so not for u. u prolly wont even understand any of the humor. i think this is prolly most aimed at those drug addicted teens that managed to scrape up enough crack money to buy a ticket. u know if thats the crowd a movie's aimed at its gonna b ridiculous. ridiculous is flippin amazing. negative reviewers of this movie r mutha flippin nuts. he wearss a flippin penis around his neck for like 20 minutes! it doesnt get better than that. this movie is straight off the hizzle. so shizzle a nizzle and pop on over to the nearest theater an purch urself a tick. oh, nat-port wears a thong thing too ;)    -ur friend, BEASTLY RHINO
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my father, who is a big fan of Frank Sinatra.  He loves it and is now interested in hearing more of Michael Buble's music.  I loved it enough to buy a copy for myself! For someone who is disappointed with today's music, this is the perfect CD to bring back the sexy, jazzy sound you don't hear much of anymore.  I don't see how anyone can listen to this music and not walk with a bounce in your step and a smile on your face after hearing it!
0316069884|3.0|This book in some ways was very hard for me to keep reading. Yet on the other hand, it was hard to put down. But, I did!  Foer's relentless, overly descriptive and repetitious point on \\"eating animals\\" begins to wear thin. While, I agree with some of Foer's points, his technique of \\"beating\\" the point to death becomes very un-inspiring after a while. Foer presents multiple points of view regarding his personal opinion on eating meat. His strength in this book, in my opinion, is his investigative journalism. His research and personal experiences are the most powerful and the most credible words in his message.    His relentless point: We as human beings need to be aware of the inhumane and the cruel treatment to which animals are subjected before they are ultimately a dish served to us for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even a measly snack.  Foer uses the unrealistic, but effective scenario, at the beginning of his book when he talks about eating man's best friend, our family pet, the dog. This is the big bang at the beginning in which Foer powers home his message and his opinion on eating animals. I thought this was an effective strategy for Foer, because it captured the attention of the reader quickly! However, after the first chapter Foer had made his point and my interest slowly diminished.     This book has some interesting dimensions which force the reader to think about what they eat and where it comes from. On the other hand, in his quest to change America's eating habits, Foer goes a little over the top by ramming his views and opinions down the reader's throat. It is all or nothing for Foer when it comes to eating any food that is not grown in the ground. There is no middle ground. What are we to do, if there were massive crop failures? Furthermore, it is not even acceptable, in Foer's point of view, to eat meat that comes from humane family farms vs. inhumane factory farms. Eggs are another bone of contention, because of the way chickens are treated. We weremade aware of his opinion on eating animals, once again, by his relentless descriptive words regarding chicken cages, chicken farms and more.    I have mixed feelings about this book. While there are interesting and factual aspects within the book, it seems to me that Foer is more interested in forcing his own personal feelings and his moral agenda on his readers.
0765356139|3.0|I like the first book in the series, Mistborn. I hadn't read any of Sanderson's original works (is Elantris the only one?) prior to my Mistborn experience, but I think that reading him as he finishes Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series made me expect a bit more from his Mistborn works.    Don't get me wrong - I love the concept of Allomancy and how Sanderson marries that with the typical fantasy storyline of Evil Oppressor and Powerful Bad Magic. I just thought he needed to develop characters more evenly and give his world a more vibrant feel.     The Well of Ascension is a step forward along those lines.     I started to feel more depth to the overall story in this book. Sanderson is developing characters and peeking in on things we only guessed at in the first novel. One can feel tendrils of other subplots starting to wind about the interactions as his world takes on a more dimensional aspect.     I would humbly suggest two things for Mr. Sanderson. One - the dialog seems a little forced and doesn't flow naturally within the story at times. That could use some fine-tuning. Two - I always like it when authors tell you up front to read What Has Come Before; in other words, don't start reading Book 2 without reading Book 1. This would save all the \\"catch up\\" text in subsequent novels that tire constant readers of the series.     If you liked Mistborn and thought the series had promise, The Well of Ascension is a good read and I recommend it. If you're expecting Jordan-esque depth to the story, you may be a bit disappointed.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|!!!!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR TRUE VIDEO/AUDIO-philes !!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I purchased the Wall-E(Two-Disc & BD Live) Blu-Ray version. It works Perfect! Offers Full 1080p quality and 7.1 DTS-MA(Master Audio). I noticed that many people had problems with defective disc and suffered scratched discs due to poor packaging with the Wall-E (3 Disc) Special Editions, so BEWARE!! But the Wall-E (Two-Disc) Blu-Ray version works perfectly fine and I have yet seen any issues.<br /><br />I bought WALL-E, for the sole purpose, to see the full potential of what my theater gear can do. I recently completed my theater system with the purchase of my NEW Vizio 55' LED, 3D, 480 HZ LCD screen (MSRP $2,099). WALL-E showed me what 480 HZ can achieve. WALL-E will show you what Blu-Ray is all about, everything in Wall-E literally look 3D even without using any 3D glasses or filters. There's no presence of grain or artifacts through out the movie, the picture quality is epic and I will use Wall-E as the new standard to test High-Performance HD televisions.<br /><br />The audio is superb. I'm using a Yamaha AVENTAGE RX-A3000 (MSRP $1,899) 7.1 system. All connections are via HDMI 1.4a, which supports the optimal signals for best picture and sound and 3D if available. My A/V confirms that Wall-E (Two-Disc)Blu-Ray version plays pure DTS-Master Audio up 7.1 channels, where some people had problems with the Wall-E-Special Edition (3 disc) only offers the compressed 5.1 DOLBY TrueHD signal on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Wall-E is the benchmark for Pixar, the actual movie is great and offers a unique experience.<br /><br />Kung-Fu Panda is another CGI flick that is PERFECT to test out your equipment. The frame rates are amazing, esp. on the slow-mo scenes.
0140120416|5.0|After reading some of the reviews for this product, I was rather skeptical in ordering. However, after looking around at a lot of other Russian books, I decided to get this one.  After a few days, the book came in and I looked through it briefly. The text and paper it's made with reminds you of an older book from the 80's, but I wasn't really looking for aesthetics. When I sat down to actually read it, I was surprised at how much information the book actually contains. Written for self study or supplementation for pretty much any Russian course, the first chapter begins with the Russian (Cyrilic) alphabet, then moves on to everyday phrases in the next chapter, grammatical exercises next, and so on and so forth.  Taking the information in small parts (like learning only five letters at a time per few minutes, or however brave you are) is highly recommended- otherwise, you'll be lost (unless familiar with the language already). Easy to learn, straightforward and to the point- that's the description I'd give this text. It's small enough to carry around, but thick enough to know there's a lot of information in it. Despite being a category three language (a very difficult language, in other words), this book breaks it down to where it's easy enough for most people to learn. Each chapter has a review and some simple exercises to practice before moving on to the next one. Review helps especially when you don't have to take any one-time tests.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Yes, I know the critics weren't especially kind, but somehow I knew this movie would be one that I would love.  First of all Cher is anything but boring to watch, and Christina Aguilera has serious pipes....how could this not be good if flimsy on plot?     Know going into this that it is all about the show, the costumes, the numbers the sheer spectacle of it all.  If that is what you are watching the movie for you will see great dance numbers, and phenomenal singing.  The story is pretty flimsy, but I wasn't watching this for a deep and meaningful story-line, I was watching it for its sheer entertainment value, and for that I got everything I had hoped for.     The movie was actually more than I had expected and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  So, if you just need to sit back and get out of your head for a while and love to watch good entertainment, I'd give it a go!
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Unstoppable is a great movie.  Keeps you on your seat.  Great use of a powerful but little known piece of engineering.  Nothing beats a true story for entertainment.
0525422943|5.0|I was expecting this to be good, obviously. But, wow, I was not expecting it to be THIS good. I have this weird obsession with a pair of movies that none of my friends like and I find fascinating. Before Sunrise and Before Sunset marked me in a way few movies have. Because I believe we've all been there, at least I have. In magical days of just hanging out with someone and being right where you want to be. One day that changes things. When lives come together and blur the lines between the past and the present. When truths inevitably come out stirring lives. Conversations and moments, silences and looks, just being next to someone and being... happy. And this book made it all come back, in book form, which made it feel even more perfect.    After being separated for three years, Adam and Mia have taken completely different paths. But seeing each other again and being together for one day, changes that. The story is told from Adam's pov, and turns out that Gayle Forman managed to do Adam's voice so amazingly well done, that I sort of forgot all my former empathy for Mia, and dove into Adam's mind, feeling his hurt and his attempts to hide them as if they were my own. It never felt forced, he never seemed weak or unlike himself. Her writing became to me so clearly Adam, that I still crave another book with his voice. He is an amazing narrator, plus he still kept his yummy hotness and multiplies it.    The writing, the plot, the events, the setting; everything worked perfectly to create one of the most beautifully romantic and utterly real books I've ever read. The emotions bloomed out of the pages. Depth is the word that describes it. The depth of the characters, the depth of the story, the depth of the feelings and interactions. Everything stirred up more feelings, more words than the ones that were written. I felt a whirlwind inside of me. And darn, that is something very hard to achieve in an avid reader. This book with its all-over depth and gut-wrenching emotional baggage, completely surpassed my love for If I Stay. This story ruined all other love stories for me. And ruined me.    These feelings, this book, this story... they will always haunt me. These feelings linger just like our own feelings. The tension was so palpable and the story was so memorable that I doubt I will ever read such a majestic book ever again. I have my hopes, though.    Given the fact that no matter what I say, it will never be enough nor will it ever do the book justice, I think YOU should read this.
B000T9QF8S|5.0|This is America, and I love lively discussions, but trashing one of the finest Beethoven cycles out in the history of recorded sound and the man with the most Grammy awards (30+) is just plain wrong.  I am a musician, and spend over 20 hours a week on the average listening to, writing, or engineering recordings.  I don't  play at being an armchair musicologist, but please allow me make a few observations and recommendations.<br /><br />First, let me address sound and technical engineering.  Until the recent recordings and SACD technology, these recordings had more clarity and \\"bite\\" than just about anything else out there.  You feel the brass, you can hear the bow hair hitting the strings, and the mallets on the tympani.  All without feeling the mikes are so close you and the orchestra are in a bathtub like on some of the original instrument cycles.  Listen for yourself.  Go to where you would download the mp3s and listen to the samples.  You get a sense of spaciousness without the overwhelming reverb, precision, and then there is the performance.  Solti's takes a traditional big orchestra approach with tempo's that aren't as brisk (and to my ears, rushed) as some of the original instrument recordings.  What Solti delivers is power and excitement that is as visual as any painting in the Louvre.<br /><br />The high points in this cycle are the entire Fifth Symphony, the Sixth, the Seventh, and the second and fourth movements of Symphony # 9.  In fact, I would go as far to say that Solti's 1970s version of the Ninth is one of the greatest recordings in history.  Martti Talvela's entrance in the 4th movement will send chills down your spine if you have the right stereo set up for it.  If there was ever an good excuse to blast the neighborhood to Jupiter, this would be it.  The other soloists and chorus are spot and turn this piece into an event...something to experience, and often.  I have to admit I like Norrington's version (with the London Classical Players on EMI) of the First and Second Symphonies [[ASIN:B00005A9O0 Beethoven - Symphonies 1-9 · Overtures / London Classical Players · Sir Roger Norrington]].  Some critics and a lot of folks hate those.  These two works were a little more like what Haydn would have turn out and Norrington's approach works for those pieces.  And as good as these recordings are, I still have a soft spot the Bruno Walter's recordings of the 4th and 5th Symphonies with the Columbia Symphony [[ASIN:B0000027UK Beethoven: The Complete Symphonies]].<br /><br />Is this version the best?  Goodness, who's to say?  In my opinion, you may get different, but you aren't going to get better.  Comparing versions of recorded classical works is like comparing apples, oranges, and motorcycles.  Toscanini's version with the NBC Symphony has lyricism and a fine sense of feel for melody.  It's also in mono.  Worth owning, but it's early days of mono.  Karajan's cycle is astounding, especially the SACD version.  The Minnesota Orchestra just turned out one of the most critically acclaimed cycles in years, and I highly recommend giving that a spin [[ASIN:B002QEXN6Q Beethoven: The Symphonies]] .  Classical music lovers tend to like the version they hear first and then judge other versions against that one.<br /><br />Give this a listen.  99 per cent of you won't be disappointed.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I was flipping through channels and caught this show on PBS from the third song.  My attention was completely captured for the next several hours.  Now, I couldnt talk myself into buying it on PBS for a pledge of $125, but I had bought it from Amazon before the end of the intermission.  The performers are all fantastic with the exception of the Jonas who was not bad, but not stellar either.  Alfie Boe is also gracing my Ipod after seeing his performance.  It is a great DVD to throw on when you are working around the house or cleaning as the music is great even without the visual performance.  The only sad thing is that this is not available on CD to listen to it in the car.  This performance is absolutely worth the money if you are a fan of musicals.
0449227545|3.0|No one can say this novel is just like the author's medieval stories about cathedrals and such! \\"Hammer\\" is about a cult left over from the sixties that turns into terrorists (mostly their leader) when a government project threatens to flood the land where they've been peacefully settled for three decades, successfully making wine to generate what little monetary income they need. The threat is that the group will cause an earthquake - seemingly a far-fetched idea which the author makes so believable that the suspense builds throughout the entire book with little respite. The gist of it is that a massive truck used in oil field exploration - a seismic vibrator - could indeed incite earth tremors if applied near a fault line.<br /><br />When the government fails to pay any attention to the group's threat, they make good on their claim and cause a quake too little to cause damage but too scary to be a coincidence. After that, it's a race between a determined FBI agent, Judy Maddox, whose career has been thwarted at almost every turn by the \\"old boy club\\" surrounding her; and the villain of the cult, \\"Priest\\", who is not above murder and mayhem to accomplish his goals. The detective work is outstanding, but on more than one occasion, we almost found ourselves rooting for the cult to survive - they were basically harmless, with an interesting set of mores, until the earthquake scheme threw everything into chaos.<br /><br />Follett shows off all his terrific writing skills herein; to us, it was a most entertaining, suspenseful thriller that kept us turning pages as rapidly as they would go!
0439023483|5.0|I am 40 and I love the Hunger Games.  I bought it for my 12 year old daughter to read, and she hasn't quit talking about it since she read it 6 months ago.  My niece that is 11 is also obsessed with it.  Now, my daughter's 7th grade class is reading it in school.  Also, my 10 year old son read it and he loves it.<br /><br />If your child has difficulty separating fiction from reality you shouldn't let them read this, as the violence of the hunger games may really disturb them.  However,if your child has already read Harry Potter and books like that, they can handle this.  I think that this book will be to this generation of kids what George Orwell's 1984 was to my generation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and the other two in the trilogy.
B0031SCV46|4.0|I conducted a LOT of research before purchasing my first midi keyboard. I checked out all of the ones in my price range of 100 to 300 on various websites, craigslist, ebay, etc.  After all of my work I settled on this lower-end keyboard because it had solid reviews and didn't look too complicated to figure out for a noob.  I must say it works great so far, flawlessly connected to Ableton and I'm off and running.  Now I just have to master Ableton...pffft
B001IF252M|3.0|It worked fine, plug and play, but it introduces significant flickering into the image, versus plugging my projector into a PC with a VGA port. Everything is just a little bit shaky. The apple firmware update mentioned in one of the reviews did nothing - it didn't detect the device. I wonder if it's a fake?<br /><br />I am disappointed with this purchase.<br /><br />EDIT: I tried it on my friend's brand new 2011, 15 inch macbook pro, it works perfectly, no flicker. I wish I knew how to get the same result on my own 2009 macbook pro.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|I've really likes this movie for a long time. It did seem this director's cut really changed the story quite a bit from the original. I may also get the original, but this one is still good. This one seems less edgy and disturbing if I remember rightly.
B004DIPLQS|4.0|These are splendid performances and are made more enjoyable by being on Blu-Ray. It's very difficult to be subjective about a Chopin interpretation; one can dissect it clinically note by note and comment on its accuracy but this can be misleading. Chopin seldom played his pieces the same way twice so any directions on the score can only be suggestive. The beauty of Chopin lies between the notes so a listener hears what he hears which may not be what another person hears. As I say, these are very good interpretations but in my view a bit over sentimental. I prefer the Kristian Zimmerman Performances. To me they are so fresh and spontaneous and I never get tired of listening to them.   Sorry I can't be more definitive.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Simply stated, this album is fantastic.  I bought it yesterday and can't put in down.  I feel as though I have been waiting since 1991 for an album that rivals Storyville.  There are certain albums that are so powerful, of such quality, that when you hear or think of them, you not only remember exactly when and where you first heard them, they evoke multiple senses from that moment.  For me, Storyville was such an album.  After listening to \\"How to Become Clairvoyant\\" I was taken back to that 1991 Storyville memory and at the same time created a new 2011 memory based on this terrific album.  Thank you for making such a thoughtful, quality album.  It is now at the top of my playlist.
0547258305|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that Po and Katsa are adorable! They make a wonderful couple.  Adults, don't be fooled by the fact that this is a young adult book, it's still a wonderful read.  I'm sure I loved it just as much now as I would have as a teen.<br />That's not to say the book doesn't have its faults.  The beginning is pretty slow and for the first hundred pages or so, I was almost bored.  But I am definitely glad that I kept with it because once I got hooked, I was in it until the end.  I believed in Katsa and Po's relationship though I found the ending to be just a bit too bittersweet, I would have preferred a more tight knit ending.  I was almost sad when it was over because I was hoping for a better wrap up but don't let that deter you.<br />Read this.  Trust me.  I have read over thirty books in the past few weeks and most of them have fallen flat.  Get this.  =)

His view is sharp, unblinking and longing for things to have been different. His voice is strong, his memories are harsh, yet tinged with the warmth of love and hope. I heard thee Audible version. I did not read the print version. In 13+ hours Frank McCourt reads his own book. In 13 hours we hear/see/feel and know dire poverty, a longing to belong to another or better class of poverty. We hear the pain in the young boy's voice as he tries to make sense of his wayward, loving, funny, supportive father. We hear the pain of the man-child recognizing his mother's desperate straits.<br /><br />We learn about all the players in this comedy he called his childhood. All the while, the big pink elephant dwells in the family's midst, some side-stepping it, some succumbing to it.<br /><br />We suffer for his mother, for his lost siblings, for the loss of a real father. We rejoice in young Frances' accomplishments -- stealing, lying, and generally getting over -- just to survive.<br /><br />Yet the main theme of this tremendous treatise on dysfunctionality is that of Frank's father, Malachy. We love him, hate him, pity him, loathe him and try to understand why Angela tolerates it all. And through young Frankie's burning, sick eyes, we see a desperation that cannot go away.<br /><br />The children grow up not questioning their lot in life, though Frankie's thoughts are ever clear and demanding. Somehow through all the neglect and borderline abuse that Frankie survives, he is polite, kind and knows his place.<br /><br />He is a true Catholic, reared in the old ways of repentence, shame and forgiveness. He can sin and when he is able to, confess and then be redeemed, knowing he will slide again and repeat the cycle.<br /><br />The peripheral characters in his story are as strong and shaping as his absent father and unconscious mother. They shape him. Alcoholism abounds in his world and it too shapes him.. without saying it, it is the omnipotent pint that shapes his views, his mores, his goals.<br /><br />Frank stumbles into adolescence wiht a bang. He is ill, his eyes are horrific, but his sight is clear, his voice is strong and his will to \\"go to America\\" prevails.<br /><br />America represents his infancy, when there was hope in Angela's heart, when Malachy reluctantly claimed Frankie as his son, yet lived his \\"Northern Irish\\" life as if Frankie was not there.<br /><br />America beckons young Frances whose real first name is NOT Frances, because life in Ireland was so, so bad. During his years between 14 and 19 he longed for and saved for America, knowing America would change his life. He was a minor criminal, far beyond stealing to survive. He was able to save money and eat and do all sorts of things separate from his hungry mother and siblings and felt no remorse.<br /><br />Already he was becoming Malachy's offspring. Frankie would do whatever he had todo or wanted to do.. to pursue his dream --- in this case, America.<br /><br />Frank's father Malachy wanted only enough money to drink and declare his love of country. Malachy never wanted a family; his ready made family came as a result of a momentary dalliance with young Angela in America. Though they had six children, Malachy never accepted his role as father or provider.<br /><br />Angela reluctantly took on her role as bearer of children, but not one time, not once in the entire book did I hear the words love from either parent or any child.<br /><br />This was a life of obligation. Children were born, children died. Sometimes they ate, sometimes they starved. No matter how little money or food (the babies had sugar water instead of milk), Malachy Sr. had his pint(s) of Guiness.<br /><br />While Frank studies his childhood with a poignant view of his pains and privations, he has warm, loving memories of moments with each of his family members. He loves the time in front of the cold fire place with his father, who is fatherly at those morning meetings. There are the moments on the stairs of their first apartment, the long walks in the country stealing apples and milk, all those wonderful things he recalls.<br /><br />But Frank's eyes look for America as his salvation. Ironically, his eyes are his major physical weakness. We wonder at the end... what about his eyes?<br /><br />Frank does get to America and is welcomed by a great event that proves right off the boat that America is the land of opportunity.<br /><br />In summary, it is a long, longing and profound look at a life, a country, a time of life and a perspective that rings true and truly harrowing all at the same time.<br /><br />I came to cheer Frankie on in his exploits, while wincing in discomfort as I realize that these are the traits he will take with him into adulthood and to America. How honest will Frank be in his lifetime, will he become an American criminal too?<br /><br />These are the elements that make for good stories, strong characters that create a \\"need to know\\" in the reader.<br /><br />Throughout the book I came to realize that had I read this book when I was a young parent, my children would have turned out differently today. I would have been more restricting, given them less and taught them more. Frank's family got by on virtually nothing -- and nothing within a community of little more than nothing.

No matter how little money or food (the babies had sugar water instead of milk), Malachy Sr. had his pint(s) of Guiness.     While Frank studies his childhood with a poignant view of his pains and privations, he has warm, loving memories of moments with each of his family members. He loves the time in front of the cold fire place with his father, who is fatherly at those morning meetings. There are the moments on the stairs of their first apartment, the long walks in the country stealing apples and milk, all those wonderful things he recalls.     But Frank's eyes look for America as his salvation. Ironically, his eyes are his major physical weakness. We wonder at the end... what about his eyes?     Frank does get to America and is welcomed by a great event that proves right off the boat that America is the land of opportunity.     In summary, it is a long, longing and profound look at a life, a country, a time of life and a perspective that rings true and truly harrowing all at the same time.     I came to cheer Frankie on in his exploits, while wincing in discomfort as I realize that these are the traits he will take with him into adulthood and to America. How honest will Frank be in his lifetime, will he become an American criminal too?     These are the elements that make for good stories, strong characters that create a \\"need to know\\" in the reader.     Throughout the book I came to realize that had I read this book when I was a young parent, my children would have turned outdifferently today. I would have been more restricting, given them less and taught them more. Frank's family got by on virtually nothing -- and nothing within a community of little more than nothing. Someone described one of their apartments as resembling Calcutta.     They were poorer than dirt and they had no way out.     Read this story with joy and anticipation. The pay-off is slow and agonizing, but in retrospect it is there.\\"     Patricia G. Kurz, Resident Scholar     A great all time classic and touching memoir.    5/5 stars.

B004QYZATW|4.0|I have never really liked Angelena Jolie, but I really liked her in this film. The scenery is sumptuous and one gets a good sense of the ambience in Venice. I have always been a Johnny Depp fan and when the movie FIRST started out, I wondered where his charisma and good looks had gone......but, as the story developed, his character develops and he goes from frumpy nerd to YEAH baby! The chemistry between them is amazing. The pace keeps your interest. The storyline was not the main draw for me, although it is reasonably interesting. What the movie becomes is more a feast for the eyes, as the costumes and shots remind you of the glamour-era cinema of days gone by.

0307592839|5.0|An interesting book, recommended by my dad, jumps around from character to character, and travels through time. This is certainly a non-linear narrative and I admit that there were times where I wasn't sure where I was and who the new characters were - but it all does seem to come together. The synopsis in this review was quite helpful to me:    (Okay - the URL was evidently deleted - but it was the New York Times review)    This book is both entertaining as well as a challenging work of literary genius.    I think we've all seen email exchanges being used as the new epistolary technique in literature - but in AVFTGS we have a seventy page power point presentation (text version) that really works, as well as an ending, set in semi-hypnogogic future section, that seems to use text messages within actual face to face conversations, that uses a quirky spelling that took a couple of pages to pick up - along the lines of learning Nadsat while reading *A Clockwork Orange.*    Personally, I enjoyed the novel in a narcissistic sense as some of the main characters (Bennie, Scotty) were, in the sections set in the late seventies /early eighties, wrapped up in the same punk music scene that I was involved with; and it was a bit chilling seeing them progress through their sometimes undesirable futures.    Highly recommended.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Husband and I rented this movie, snuggled down in the living room for a rainy evening of mindless entertainment and found we REALLY liked this movie! No gruesome gore, no loud endless bombs and blasting, no filthy vulgar language, just a great piece of entertainment. Great music, predictable story-line (nothing that keeps you biting your nails off), great actresses, just a simple great movie. There's something wonderful to be said for \\"mindless entertainment\\" at times when you just want to relax, have some popcorn with your honey and enjoy a good show. That's the reason I'm purchasing this video, you can't always find a good movie like this when a rainy evening presents itself! Now we'll have it on hand.
0756404738|3.0|Not nearly as tight and entertaining as the original.  The climax of the book takes place at like the 60% mark and the ending seems to drag forever.  It feels like this book did not get enough attention in the editing stage.
0142407542|5.0|We were introduced to \\"The Gruffalo\\" when we visited our family in the UK over Christmas so we purchased a copy of The Gruffalo and The Gruffalo's Child.  Since our return I've been purchasing copies of each of the books for birthday gifts for my daughter's classmates.  They've even borrowed the book a couple of times in her class at preschool.  I've also bought a number of Julia Donaldson's other books too.  Can't recommend them enough!
B000001G53|5.0|For my money, this is a sublime recording.  All the supposed faults that Karajan had as a conductor are qualities here.  Just listen to the Act 3 Vorspiel for example.  In Karajan hands, it's ending is dramatically shattering--just as it should be.  I've always felt that Karajan was always at his best performing Wagner.  I've been a fan of Knappertsbusch's many performances also.  Kna always had better singers with the likes of George London and Martha Modl often in his casts. But the orchestra must be the mood setter in this opera, and Karajan's vision and wise pacing makes this recording my favorite rendition--hands down.  No one else comes close.    For the best historical recording I would recommend the 1953 Krauss Bayreuth production---a wonderful live performance in good mono sound with an excellent Parsifal sung by Ramon Vinay.  Kna's 1951 live Bayreuth recording is also excellent for a contrasting religious interpretation, gloriously sung and recorded.

1594202842|4.0|I think the mother plays a very important part of a child's future. When the kids are young, they need guidence for going to the right direction. Most of the kids do not know their direction when they were young. Tiger mom might not be the best way to raise up the kid, but her way will work for about 90% of the kids. I do believed that practice will make perfect. The thing I like about this book is that she seems like so successful and in some way she is similiar to us (middle class ppl). She taught me that even people who has a great background, they need to keep studing, practicing so hard. I admired her energy, and patiences that she had for her kids. As a mother, I know it's a struggle to push kids to do something they don't like. It might sounds harsh at first, but if you think about the glories after the hard work, it's all worth it.
B001UV4XI8|1.0|Note: This is not a rating on the movie itself, this is on the Warner Brothers (WB) misleading packaging suggesting the digital copy is included.    I got the 3 pack and of course paid extra for it but when it arrived there were 3 DVD's but no digital copy, the 3rd DVD is just special features, of which the digital copy is not one of them.    If you look at the cover or product description is says Three-Disc-Combo Blu-ray / DVD Combo + digital copy. Don't know about you but when I see three disc combo, and that description I assumed the three listed on cover and description are actually in the package, it isn't, instead the 3rd disc is the Special Features. I got the TRON combo pack, which said it had a digital copy and it really did...    Very misleading in my opinion, but wait, it gets worse.    When I went to Download it, you can't even just download the movie, it makes you download a 510MB Installer (bigger than the Windows 7 Installer!). Once you have the installer it just gets worse as it then tries to make you take WB Digital Movie Manager even if you pick the option just for the movie.     When I saw all of the junk it wanted to install I aborted out of it. So if you wanted the digital copy without a terabyte of overhead and garbage installed on your computer I would skip this deal and just get the movie without the junk.    I like my digital copies on DVD, never saw this scam before, the WB application basically wants to take over your movie collection and report all of your movies back to WB, there are so many things wrong with that idea I will not even start, just say, Warner Brothers must be out of their mind and planning to dupe a bunch of kids. To date this is the most shamefull packaging of a Movie deal I have ever seen.    The kicker is that if you do not agree to the totally unreasonable terms you get no digital copy. If I wanted to share the contents of my movie collection with WB I would send them an email with the list, nor will I install an application where I have no control or view in to what it is sending home, it should be illegal to put spyware like that on your system but the agreement makes you give them permission to hunt around on your PC and pass the information back to WB.    So sad they pull this on anyone but you know this will end up on tons of PC with unsuspecting users piling more junk on their PC and WB Exclusive spyware. This is a good package to avoid unless you have to have the digital copy of this at any cost.    If you opt for the iTunes version and not the Windows version you are not forced to take the WB manager, but you are then stuck with only being able to play it on systems with iTunes.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Had to wait until the DVD came out to see this in NZ, and it was worth every month I waited, while wading through critic-loving review after critic-loving review from afar. From the first moment I was blown away. The opening scene punches right through a major zombie-flick taboo, and it only gets better from there. Everyone I've shared it with has loved it, even my non-horror-movie-watching friend (who is now afraid to go to the loo in the middle of the night). It's the character development that's going to keep everyone watching, and the fx is incredible too. On tenterhooks for next season.
0756404738|3.0|I was a little disappointed when I read this. I absolutely loved Name of the Wind, and I waited forever for this book to come out. But it just wasn't the same. It felt like the author was writing because he had to write, instead of writing from the heart. The first book was so full of emotion, with his family being murdered, being depressed and living homeless, getting the crap beat out of him almost every day. I really felt for the character. I was in his mind, experiencing the emotions that he was experiencing. This book, though, had none of that emotion, and that's what I craved most. Actually, now that I think about it, there wasn't much that happened in this book. Most of it was just Rothfuss rambling on and on about boring things, such as, learning sign-language and learning how to fight. I think the whole story could've been dumbed down to about 300 pages and and still be a decent novel, possibly a better one. I also noticed a lot more cursing in this than the last one, which brought me down a little. I don't mind a little cursing out loud, but to write it on paper shows lack of professionalism and creativity. But, even with that said, I'm still a huge Rothfuss fan and am greatly looking forward to his next book.
B004LWZVZM|3.0|Like his fellow film icon Kevin Costner, Robert Redford is a true son of the Sixties and for the past twenty years has been trying to out-costner Kevin in sentimental stories of underdog struggles. Both the icons lean towards pop history, and Redford's latest in this category is \\"The Conspirator\\", the tale of Mary Surratt, the widow who was accused of harboring in her Washington DC boarding house the men who plotted the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. Redford has tried to give this telling a great deal of importance, but perhaps it was his very gravity which betrayed him. In other words, a great deal of the picture is dull. Much of the conflict is performed in daytime drama style, draining the picture of its more successful elements; and, unfortunately, the whole production has a somewhat facile pre-fab appearance. The 19th Century has rarely looked so neat. The only thing missing is the candy-box Technicolor from M~G~M's version of \\"Little Women\\". I recall only one shot in \\"The Conspirator\\" of someone smoking, and the Capital's streets seem spotless. Then for some unknown reason (perhaps to balance all the PC primness) there's a completely unbelievable scene in which a young beau jocosely moons a mixed company at an elegant soirée. In 1865? I don't think so. Maybe Redford got the 1860s confused with the 1960s. He also seems a little confused about his characters' viewpoints: the young Yankee lawyer who is chosen to defend Mrs Surratt at first seems repelled by her, then somewhat abruptly admires her, perhaps won over by her quiet dignity. Actually, Mrs Surratt seems quiet to the point of indifference, particularly for someone on trial for her life. Then there's her implicated son whom the screenplay tries desperately to make sympathetic, but the fact is he stands by and lets his mother be executed, stating in one of the final scenes that he didn't really think they'd do it. But obviously it's the young lawyer who is meant to be the story's hero. The movie opens with a scene on an 1863 battlefield in which the wounded officer insists that his comrade be tended to first (\\"That's an order!\\"); and it ends with his leaving his corrupt profession and entering the pure world of journalism. Yes, the Washington Post, which exposed Watergate and brought the aggressive idealism of the Sixties to its climax. All this hero needs are love beads and a copy of Charles A Reich.

B001UV4XI8|2.0|It must be possible these days to feed a text into a machine which transfers words directly to images because, unlike the previous films, Deathly Hallows Part 1 almost resembles the first half of the novel exactly.  This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically.  And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable.  Now, however, the filmmakers have decided to give the purists what they want . . . to the detriment of the film, not least because Deathly Hallows the novel was such a mess to begin with.

B004289ZW0|2.0|I don't have the swipe-on/swipe-off problem other folks have in this forum.  That feature seems to work fine.  What I am disappointed in is its basic specs.  I should have been a bit more suspicious when basic stats such as accuracy and refresh rate are impossible to find on the GNS web site.  Upon receiving the unit, I can confirm the following:    It uses an older version MediaTek chipset.  As a result, its accuracy is no better than the internal GPS on the iPhone 4 and iPad 2.  In fact, in general, if the GNS 5870 is showing a horizontal accuracy of 10 meters and a vertical accuracy of 10 meters (10/10), then the internal GPS of the iPhone 4 will typically show 5/10.  iPad 2 was a little closer, sometimes beating the GNS, most of the time matching it.  This was tested using GPS-Status app from the app store.  Its refresh rate is only 1hz and is not configurable.      I would have expected a unit such as this to have much better accuracy than the internal chipsets, and for it to not have at least a 5 hz refresh rate is pretty lame.    On the plus side, its Bluetooth pairing is quite fast and reliable.  As a result, I could recommend this product as a backfill for non-GPS iPods and iPads, as well as older GPS-enabled models.  I cannot recommend it as a more accurate replacement for internal chipsets on the latest models of iPhones and iPads.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|\\"Hi, someone wanna tell me why I had to log off BangingGranniesdotcom for this?\\" Iffy comments like that being bandied about by a morning talk show anchor, well, the guy's just begging to be fired. Rachel McAdams plays Becky Fuller, the young new executive producer of a perpetual cellar-dwelling morning talk show who must quickly whip her staff into shape and drive up the ratings, lest \\"new producer\\" promptly becomes \\"ex-producer.\\" This morning program she finds herself employed in is so down in the dumps that even the doorknobs don't function. One of Becky's first and immediate hurdles is how she responds to this crude talk show host. She very publicly gives him his walking papers, and the staff is mildly impressed.<br /><br />What's the story, morning glory? What's the word, hummingbird? Things turn around, thanks to Becky's boundless energy and inventiveness, but mostly to her big get in the shape of Daybreak's new co-host, the legendary Pulitzer Prize winner (and unbelievably superior and condescending) Mike Pomeroy (a wonderfully acerbic Harrison Ford). Except that Pomeroy, an old school, serious news anchor, maintains that \\"news is a sacred temple\\" and he won't stoop to doing fluff pieces, which happen to be the lifeblood of morning talk shows. His diva ploy doesn't sit real well with his television partner, Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) who herself massages a gynormous ego. Anyway, here come the mutual upstaging and combativeness and the frightful bicker, waged in excruciatingly polite tones. The pity of the thing is that Ford and Keaton aren't given enough scenes in which they exchange wicked banter.<br /><br />MORNING GLORY does feature a romantic comedy angle, but it's a weak, half-hearted effort, at best. While not as meaty, MORNING GLORY bears closer kinship with BROADCAST NEWS, a film which does have romantic elements but focuses more on the behind-the-scenes minutiae of putting together a television show. Wisely, the plot in MORNING GLORY hones in more closely on the trying working relationship between Becky Fuller and her demanding star Mike Pomeroy. That's not to say that Patrick Wilson, who plays the love interest, isn't funny and sensitive and quite the catch. But he's simply not as compelling as Harrison Ford, even if (or maybe because) Ford's character is widely regarded as \\"the third worst person in the world.\\" Star power crushes the charming up-and-comer, and, really, the true emotional pull comes from McAdams' interactions with Ford. They've got this neat contentious mentor-student, almost father-daughter thing going on.<br /><br />I've seen Rachel McAdams in MEAN GIRLS and SLINGS & ARROWS and in RED EYE, and she's uniformly excelled in these different genres. One more time, in MORNING GLORY, she proves to be a first rate comedienne. She's such a pleasure to watch (and I don't mean that she's just pretty to ogle at). Her character here, relentlessly talky and unendingly klutzy, is a fairly cliched one. But, to me, it speaks of how talented she is that she's still able to turn something contrived into something endearing. And, yeah, I think it's endearing that her character's aggressive rambling and work obsessiveness are defensive coping mechanisms. She's just so watchable.<br /><br />MORNING GLORY doles out plenty of laughs, some stemming from the cast's sparkling (sometimes very caustic) dialogue, some from the crazy antics McAdams comes up with in her all out efforts to save her show from cancellation. And, oh, that weatherman, the mad s#!t he had to go thru, for ratings' sake. His ordeals made me laugh a lot, the poor bastard. In the end, it all works out. Daybreak achieves a ratings boost, stays on the air. Ford gets to break a hard-hitting story.

B000MV9026|3.0|Happy Feet is an enjoyable movie and definitely one of the most unique storylines i've ever seen, with alot of fun music along the way. Whomever wrote this (apparently George Miller and others) must have a really unique mind.<br /><br />The story features a large colony of Emperor penguins in the south pole, with the main character, Mumble, a young penguin who displays an unusual rhythmic musical talent. His parents are the kind hearted Norma Jean, and his dad, a hilarious Elvis-character named Memphis. Most penguins of Mumbles' kind display a talent for Old-English type, classical singing and are seen progressing nicely in school led by an old fashioned teacher of the same kind. Mumble is somewhat shunned in his community for being different in his dancing talent. Ironically, the penguins all appear cloned expect for Mumble, who is even a bit physically different from birth.<br /><br />Along the way, Mumble meets up with a group of Mexican penguins. The penguins do not understand the need for the rhythm of tap dance or soulful singing to attract a mate, and introduce Mumble to the sultry Latin styles of music and dance. Throughout the movie, a variety of song and dance is introduced from various races and ethnic groups, emphasizing that each has its own style of musical romancing to attract a mate called a \\"heartsong.\\"<br /><br />As the movie progresses, Mumble will slowly win the heart of his community (and girl) with his unique style, his \\"happy feet\\" that can't stand still. A group of fuddy-duddy old men penguins look on to the dancing of the young penguins, and find this \\"new\\" style of music (akin to the blues, rock and roll, and disco in human terms) to be a religious and indecent outrage.<br /><br />Woven throughout the storyline is the concept that \\"aliens\\" (actually humans) are capturing the penguins for show in aquariums. While i love animals, i agree with the other reviewers that the enviromentalist message was overdone. Mumble is temporarily captured for the aquarium, and entertains the human visitors with his dancing. He, of course, eventually makes it back to the penguin colony (to the relief of his aging and weary father Memphis. Memphis is discourage as Mumble has broken with tradition, altho Elvis/Memphis was a blues singer himself, so it doesn't make much sense.) All's well that ends well, with Mumbles' return of himself and his happy feet.the human visitors with his dancing.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|It pains me to give anything related to Harry Potter one star, but I was so disappointed by Warner Bros cheap packaging that I had to rate it that way. This rating is only for the DVD itself- I though the film itself was one of the best (and definitely the most loyal) Potter film to date. But why are there no options for special features for DVD buyers? I was looking forward to purchasing a special edition two disc DVD loaded with special features for a fan like me, only to realize the only feature was additional scenes. No behind the scenes footage. No preview for the upcoming movie. No-that's only for people with a Blu Ray player. You think with the economy the way it is WB would realize many people can't afford higher priced products like a Blu Ray player, and it's unfair to make all the good features exclusive to that disc. It didn't make me want to buy a player-it just made me mad. If they do this for the final film I will be sorely disappointed.

B004L49K20|5.0|I've been a fair-weather DD fan since 1982.  The seminal works in my music education were the first Duran Duran album and Rio.  My interest began to wane with Seven and the Ragged Tiger, and by the time Notorious came out in 1986 I had moved on.  Although \\"The Wedding Album\\" was released in 1993, I didn't pick up a copy until 1998 and fell in love with DD again.  I swooned through the reunion period and loved 2005's Astronaut album, then felt completely alienated by Red Carpet Massacre.  I wondered if the guys could pull off a great album again.    They did.  This is the one.    By all means it isn't perfect, but I think there is something for everyone on this album.  The disco-funk of \\"Safe,\\" the post-punk in-your-face anthem of \\"All You Need is Now,\\" the gothic, sensual \\"Man Who Stole a Leopard,\\" the mourning of \\"Before the Rain,\\" and the redemption of \\"Leave a Light On.\\"      Let your inner Duranie out and give this album a try.  It won't let you down.

I have only read a few chapters, but it is very well written and forces your mind to relive moments in the show. Great book so far even though I know how it is going to end. Can't wait to finish it.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Bought the first season in a pawn shop being that is was very cheap and I had never heard a bad word about the show. This show has quickly jumped near the top of my favorite TV shows. From the moment you meet Dexter all the way through the season, you can feel a darkness attaching to you as you start to feel for Dexter. I loved this season and just picked up the second season. This will probably be the best thirteen hours you ever spend watching TV.
0316017922|3.0|Part One of this book was interesting, but Part Two seemed prolix and padded out to justify the book's $30. price.  For example, in the Harlan , Kentuck section, did we realy have to wade through all those feuds just to find out that Southerners are culturally slower to anger than Northeners, but, once angered, are more prone to violence? And the section on airplane crashes overwhelms one with boring details; we're not training to become pilots.  The book could have used both end-of-chapter and end-of-book summaries to boil down the conclusions.  Another thing not adequately discussed is the luck factor in success.  Why did the Beattles agent in Liverpool just happen to meet the German nightclub owner who hired them.  Why did a lucky concatenation of events make it possilbe for Bill Gates to get his early and free computer training?  What makes some people luckier?  What are the rest of us--chopped liver?  Another thing not discussed--the grand children of turn-of-the-century Jewish immigrants in the garment trade become lawyers and doctors--who paid for their law school education, their parents?  One subject, Chris Langan, did not like to work for someone else for a paycheck because he would have to do what his boss wanted instead of what he wanted.  Gladwell speculates that Oppenheimer would have done better in Langan's situation because Oppenheimer had a persuasive gift of gab, but when Oppenheimer's laboratory boss wants him to do something he (Oppenheimer) doesn't like, then Oppenheimer tries to poison him!  This is better than Langan's way?  At any rate, Part Two should have been condensed in favor of a final chapter summing up the findings and giving the reader some useful, practical conclusions.  As for the 10,000-hours of practice requirement, John Ruskin, the 19th Century art critic/artist, said one could learn to draw well in 150 hours of practice.

0670022411|4.0|I almost stopped reading this book.  Fortunately NPR reviewed it and mentioned that after the 10th chapter or so it would get better.  It did.  After a painfully slow start, with less than interesting dialogue, I was ready to put the book down.  Then suddenly, it took off.  The book contains witty statements and interesting historical facts. Seeming inaccuracies are later ironed out so that they make complete sense.  By the end of the book I found my self longing for the next one.  I'm extremely upset that I have to wait for 2012 for the sequel.  Here's to hoping that the third book in the Trilogy will be out before the end of 2012 and that the suspense is kept short.
0061726826|5.0|I started reading Delirium with some trepidation.  One, I tend to be picky when it comes to YA, and two, the hype for this book has been out of this world. Delirium takes place in a present day, alternate Portland, and the President and the Consortium has declared love to be a disease (amor delirium nervosa). The declaration was made 64 years ago, and a \\"cure\\" was discovered 43 years ago. Everyone aged 18 is given the cure, and that's where we find our narrator, 17 year old Lena, on the cusp of her 18th birthday, and the promise of a \\"better\\" future. A future without love.<br /><br />In Lena's world, everything is assigned; schools, majors...mates. Romeo and Juliet is required reading...as a cautionary tale. There is actually an emergency toll-free line that can be called if someone is suspected of contacting deliria. Regulators, groups of volunteer citizens and government employees, patrol the streets at night, looking for \\"uncureds\\" out after curfew. Without love, some parents find parenting distasteful, often killing their children, and the government constantly monitors communications, looking for keywords such as \\"love\\", \\"Invalids\\", or \\"sympathizer\\". Invalids are sympathizers that live in the Wilds, the unregulated land that exists between recognized cities and towns. The borders of the US were closed 50 years ago and are now guarded constantly by military personnel. Sympathizers are summarily executed.<br />When a sympathizer group interrupts Lena's exams, which will decide what her future will hold, she gets her first glimpse of Alex, and when they finally meet, Lena will question everything that she's been taught, because Alex has a secret.<br /><br />Lena is awkward and unsure of herself, describing herself as neither pretty nor ugly, and in her words, just short. She especially feels plain next to her best friend Hana, who is beautiful, and confident; everything Lena feels she is not. Lauren Oliver's prose is smooth, lyrical, and sometimes brutal.  We are drawn into Lena's world of fear; fear of deliria, and also fear of being \\"cured\\". As Lena struggles to cope with her family's legacy, her war within herself, and her ultimate awakening, we are reminded of what it means to love, and be loved, how without pain, love would be meaningless, and how fragile we really are. Delirium took me back and made me remember what it was like to fall in love for the first time, to feel like I was I was drifting in a sparkling, clear blue sea, with no fear of drowning, and no wish to come up for air. When a revelation about Lena's past is uncovered, she will question everything that she has ever known, about her mother, about herself, and make a decision that will change everything.<br /><br />There were parts of this novel that chilled me, scenes that struck me to my core, sometimes moved me to tears, and made me realize how lucky we are to have choices; choices in life, education, friendships, and, perhaps most importantly, choices in love. The only thing missing, for me, is the big why of how love came to be thought of as a disease. We're given the obvious reasons: pay special attention to the \\"quotes\\" at the beginning of each chapter from publications like \\"The Safety, Health, and Happiness Handbook\\", better known as The Book of Shhh (some are fairly disturbing), and Genesis: A Complete History of the World and the Known Universe. However, I'd like to know what would make people want to take away the one thing that really defines us as human beings, and sometimes gives us a reason to live in even the darkest times. Maybe in a future novel?<br /><br />With the recent influx of dystopian YA fiction, Delirium is a standout, not to be missed!rld of fear; fear of deliria, and also fear of being \\"cured\\".

B004G600A4|1.0|What a glorious feat of animation. What potential. Wasted. I agree with the other 1-star reviewers in saying this movie sends a negative message about parents and children, and about 'boyfriends' and freedom. But, the crowning horror: the evil fake mother ACTUALLY STABBING, with a knife, the thief/boyfriend in the side. I didn't see it coming, and I was horrified. Oh- yes, let's not forget my daughter, who had just turned 5, bursting into tears as the thief died. \\"That's the saddest thing I ever saw!\\" she said, in a choked little voice. Major applause for the movie-makers who talked themselves into thinking that was ok. One question: are you nuts? This isn't ok. A princess movie with that kind of horror-movie stuff? No, in case you need a little help thinking it through, it's really not part of classic fairy tales to have this kind of realistically-depicted violence. You can't justify that scene as some kind of truth-in-art.  The interaction between the fake mother and the princess was terribly disturbing, blurring so many lines about love and real mother-daughter relationships, with the worst kind of psychological abuse. As well as the message to young girls- hey, your home life can be awful, but some guy will come along and take you away from all that- any guy, whatever, it'll all work out: because you, the 'princess,' are so lovely, and life will reward you for that. The evil queen needing the princess's magic hair to stay young/beautiful? Hey- where was that in the original story? It wasn't. Just more Hollywood-style women-bashing. Sending the message to young girls, run away from home, your mother's just jealous of your beauty and doesn't want you to have fun, or get the guy. Wow. Did NONE of this occur to someone in charge at this movie studio? The least you should be is embarassed, the truth is you should be ashamed. Any fathers of daughters, husbands of wives, working there? At all?

Dr. Jekyll feels younger and powerful as Mr. Hyde, and his evil self commits many crimes.  When he takes the potion to transform back into Dr. Jekyll, he attempts to make up for the crimes committed by Hyde.<br /><br />Soon, people begin to notice Dr. Jekyll's close relationship with Mr. Hyde.  This disturbs Dr. Jekyll's lawyer, who is also the executor of his will.  The lawyer grows suspicious when Mr. Hyde is named the main beneficiary.  To make matters worse, Dr. Jekyll no longer needs a potion to transform into Hyde, and his crimes escalate.  Can Dr. Jekyll regain control of his soul or is he cursed to be evil forever?<br /><br />This novel was an instant success.  The Victorians were fascinated by the allegorical drama illustrated in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  The book was so popular, it inspired stage plays a year after its publications.  Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this novel during a two-year stay on the south coast of England, where he also wrote another famous book, Kidnapped.<br />-- Reviewed by Veronica Hernanadez
B0009RCPY8|3.0|Bought this for my 9 year old and was horror struck with some of the adult content in the first movie- Sigourney Weaver throws Bill Murray on the bed and mounts him!

0307595862|5.0|Admittedly the promo of Jo Nesbo being the new Steig Larsson and preliminary reviews enticed me to read \\"The Snowman.\\"  The cover of the book so easily drew me in.<br /><br />From the very first chapter, high expectations were met as I find myself gasping, taking a deep breath, and never really knowing who the \\"Snowman\\" was.  As each character was introduced, there was evidence that indeed he or she could be the killer.<br /><br />Using a snowman as the killer's mark, we go through vast stories of individuals that are memorable.  Descriptions are right on and there is just enough to continue to keep your mouth wide open as you get further and further into the book.<br /><br />Down to its last pages...the book was held me in its grip. I know I will read it again someday and explore Jo Nesbo's complex characters in his other novels.

Therefore, I won't break down each song and give a critique. All I can really say is that this CD is unbelievably fantastic; both fans and non-fans of Ms. Spears will love the techno beats. Each song is markedly different from one another, making this ablum fresh and unique. And for someone who has been in the industry as long as she has, that in itself is quite a feat.<br /><br />I give Femme Fatale a 5... out of 5.
0316056863|5.0|I both read this book and listened to the audiobook.  I think its a practical (if slightly expensive) choice since the experience is entirely different from one medium to the other.  Reading the book you get a taste of just how damned funny this woman is on her own.  Listening to the audiobook, read by Tina Fey, its more like she's telling you these stories friend to friend.  Geeky, witty and ironic friend to geeky, socially anxious friend...but none the less.  I think she's hilarious--I've adored her since the first time I saw her on SNL and that adoration has only grown over the years.  However as I'm sure others have found celebrities who are interesting to watch aren't always as interesting to read.<br /><br />I'm not one for non-fiction too often (reality is boring to me), but for the few celebrities who I've read their memoirs for Tina Fey is one of my favorites (on par with Michael J Fox's [book:Lucky Man: A Memoir 133729]).  I learned two important things while listening/reading her essays, memories and anecdotes: 1) Its okay to be who I want to be and 2) petite women always walk pigeon-toed (take that Dr. Kliner Pediatrician).<br /><br />Fey's honesty about practically everything was hypnotizing.  She doesn't sweeten things or attempt to look at bad experiences with rose-tinted glasses--they are hers and they are what made her who she is.  Her insensitive beliefs (from the first time she realized that gay people aren't just there for her entertainment), gender disbeliefs (apparently men pee in cups when they're lazy) and awkward questions from the ignorant (her response to a TMZ comment that she should 'do something about that scar on her cheek' is priceless) are all hilarious and heartfelt and real.<br /><br />Could she just be BS'ing and a great actress?  Well not according to some critics...no but seriously of all the things in the world a celebrity of her stature could lie about why would she lie about her anxiousness upon meeting Sly Stallone the first time?  Or the embarrassment of her mom helping her try on bras over her shirt in the middle of a JC Pennys?<br /><br />One of the biggest things I took away from this collection is that its okay to be me.  I'm petite, brunette, with frizzy untameable hair, a penchant for being too loud when excited and not the slim pixie waif so popular (thank you Ellen Page) for my height--but I'm me.  Am I also likely to go back to counting calories and binge-exercising in hopes of being the same size as Ellen Page tomorrow...yes.  But I'll do those things secure in the knowledge that I'm not doing it to fit an 'ideal' body image for someone else, but because that's what I want.ssment of her mom helping her try on bras over her shirt in the middle of a JC Pennys?

B000PMG16U|2.0|Star Wars 4 to 6 introduced Jedi Knights with powers and intellect not to be reckoned with. The film was serious and even the parts with a bit of humour had a serious edge to it (C3PO and Han Solo). The gravity of the situation was not diminished nor was it a distraction to the overall plot. The impression I had overall after watching the original series was that you do not mess with a Jedi and a sith Lord is the ultimate force of evil, deadly and serious.    Coming to the prequel, a jedi is just someone who can perform fancy tricks. The hint of the overall power of a Jedi given by Yoda in Episode V should have been eloborated in great detail in the phantom menace. Nothing was shown, hence the new generation saw the Jedi as a fancy sword wielder with a bit of mind of matter capabilities and insights here and there as to how. No real introduction to the force and the exceptional discipline and moral standard that was required by the Jedi to manipulate the force was provided and the first episode should have been primarily an emphasis on that (introducing the good and dark side and the overwhelming hope and threat relatively).    The film is a serious one, why try and make it a comedy? It completely destroys the primary focus of the battle between good and evil and the deception that is propagated from the dark side. An entire galaxy is about to enter a realm of slavery and Jaja is cracking jokes while droids are trying to act a comedy sidekick. Even Obi One seems to be joking around more than anything else or atleast have a non caring attitude about everything?    A bounty hunter is able to give A JEDI KNIGHT a hard time in episode 2 and although OBI ONE destroys a sith where even Qui Gon failed, whenever he is involved in a light sabre dual he gets his backside kicked within a few seconds and yet, he defeats Anakin in Part III???? Absolutely ridiculous, he is obviously one of the powerful jedis and hence he survives where almost all die. Anyway, part three was as close to the originals as is possible, the other two makes one feel as though they are simply watching a 3D animation or some movie where there is a lot of special effects without any real purpose to it. Can you imagine. Lord of the Rings with as many attempts at comedy, how much less would the threat of Sauron be? Simirlarly the threat of the Dark Lord or the Dark side is ever so dimished with all the distractions in the film.    SPOLIER BELOW BEWARE:    One of the most ridiculous parts was where Anikan kills the sand people, women and children and the elderly, and when he tells Padmea, she hugs and comforts him? The guy just butchered children and you say, \\"there there, its ok sweetie....\\"
B001UV4XHY|1.0|...it's because this is the lousiest transfer of film-to-DVD that I have ever purchased.  Each scene, entirely washed out and 'dark'; it's almost like watching it in black and white.

1401201911|5.0|This is by far one of the best alternate universes ever written.  Way better than others I've read, including Superman:Earth One.  This is a \\"what if\\" scenario at it's best.  What if Superman arrived just a little early and crashed in Russia instead of Kansis?  Well he would have been raised with Communist values in mind and not baseball and apple pie.  This Superman once his superpowers manifast themselves becomes the poster boy for Russia and enemy number one for America.  Lex is sort of the good guy in this novel.  Superman eventually takes power after Stalin is poisoned and spreads communism to the whole world, except the U.S.  He has the best of attentions in mind.  He just wants everyone to be safe, have food, etc, at the cost of free speech and thought.  Batman makes a short but memorable appearance as well, along with Wonder-Woman and Hal Jordan.

B004EJ14V2|4.0|This is what you're looking for if you just want an enjoyable comedy. Emma Stone is always great, and this movie is no exception. It's like \\"Juno\\" in that the main character seems far too worldly and a bit too snarky for her age, but hey...it's a movie, not a documentary, right? After helping a kid at school cover up the fact that he's gay by pretending to sleep with him, things spiral out of control. They're of course reading \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" in English class, and Stone's character Olive takes up Hester's 'burden' proudly. It's a fun re-imagining of Hawthorne's classic for today's culture. Wow, that sounds really deep...it's really funny and a lot of fun. Give it a try!

B000BW7QX6|5.0|I LOVE \\"Firefly.\\" It's probably the best series ever cancelled. That being said, the way it just...ended was completely unsatisfying. Like so many fans, I was hoping they would bring the series back. That obviously couldn't happen considering most of the principal actors had moved on to other projects, so this was the next best thing. The movie picks up a bit after the series ends, but it also goes back to before the series started to help wrap up a lot of what the series never had a chance to. The storyline is epic, as is proper for a major motion picture, and the fight scenes are awesome. They also preserved the humor and playfulness of the series. It was a great way to give the fans closure.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" is quite simply the best series ever cancelled. I think Fox was expecting \\"Buffy In Space\\" and cancelled it when they realized it was something entirely different. They should have at least waited long enough to find out that it was awesome! Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, Morena Baccarin, heck...pretty much the whole cast...they're all faces you know and love now. They all shined in this show. And this isn't just some sci-fi cult following sort of show. I mentioned it to my 71 year-old mother who enjoys Nathan Fillion in \\"Castle\\" that he was in this show, too. She saw that it was coming on some channel as a marathon, and decided to watch one of them. She sat down at noon to watch the pilot and had to set her DVR to keep recording the end of the marathon at 1:30 the next morning because she couldn't stay awake any longer and couldn't stand the thought of missing any of them. So far, I own it and I've given it as gifts to my mother and brother.
B003L7DK6U|5.0|This is Bruce Lee's finest film.  The Blu Ray transfer makes the film look as if it was made recently and not 38 years ago.  The colors and picture are crisp.  The extras alone help make this disk a 'must have!'
B001992NW4|1.0|I think when I was really young, I remember a few snippets from this film as my parents and I went to the drive-in to see this film.  Because I was so young, I could probably be easily scared.  So, most of my life, I hear people saying that this is the scariest horror film ever made.  So, I've avoided watching this film ever again because I don't really like horror films anyway.<br /><br />But, I did watch it again today, 38 years later, and all I can say is that, it's not so scary.  If anything, if I could keep myself from being bored, I found it laughable, at best.<br /><br />It really dragged more than I could stand.  Heck, of the first 50 minutes of this film, I find that over 95 percent of that time, the build-up scenes were scarcely relevant.  And of the whole film, a good half of the film could have been cut because so much of this story was so vaguely irrelevant!  My wife never seen or heard of this film in her country when she was young, so she went to bed about an hour into the film because she got bored.  I told her that I was going to tough it out, because I do remember something frightening about this film, so I was going to wait for it.  Well, when it was all over, I took the DVD out, turned off the DVD player, and then walked away with a mild smirk and chuckle.<br /><br />I think the original \\"Stepford Wives\\" (1975) was scarier than this film.
0385737955|5.0|I really loved this book. I've always been a big reader but the last couple years I've only been able to finish a couple books because I've been so busy. However, although I was more busy than usual while reading this book, I read it quickly (over half of it being in one sitting). The book makes you very curious and each chapter cuts off leaving you wanting more. There is always something going on that makes you want to read more. It's face-paced, but not too face-paced that you lose important details.

078322947X|3.0|Sorcerer works most effectively for passionate students of film. It's interesting to see a more modern take on the Wages of Fear story, and it works on a meta level as a quasi-Apocalypse Now/Fitzcarraldo bit of cursed ambitious-production filmmaking.    Unlike those films, however, Sorcerer seems to have been crippled by focus on stunts and production, over plot and pacing. The original Wages of Fear lagged needlessly in the first hour, and Sorcerer only extends that part of the story to no particular purpose besides a sort of self-indulgent wallowing. Extra time is spent on giving additional background to the protagonists, but we get to know them in less depth psychologically as individuals than in the original.    The framing of shots is painfully dated, distinctly 80s in style. The synthesizer score, praised in some quarters, only adds to the limited 80s vibe of the piece. It's never a good sign when the 50s version feels more modern than the more recent remake.    Roy Scheider is as good as ever, which is to say excellent. Unfortunately, the editing gives little visibility to the best aspects of his performance potential. Bruno Cremer brings little to the table. The other leads are forgettable/inadvertently comical.    I would recommend purchasing and viewing the movie, but read up on its production history first [...]. It'll make the stodgy pacing more bearable, and allow you to enjoy the stunt set pieces in their full, blinkered glory.

B004M20YDU|4.0|A preface: From what I understand, I am not a \\"true\\" Daft Punk fan.  I was in middle school when Daft Punk hit the music scene with Homework, and I was mostly into oldies and John Williams at the time.  In fact, I had never heard of Daft Punk until after I attending the midnight showing of Tron: Legacy.  Needless to say, I fell in love with the soundtrack and bought it the very next day - never before had I even heard this kind of music.  Sure, the orchestral parts are great, but End of Line became my new favorite (so much better than the heavily marketed single Derezzed, by the way).    I had to immerse myself into Daft-Punkdom, buying Discovery, Human After All, Alive 2007, the single CD for Da Funk (which features Musique and Ten Minutes of Funk), and finally Reconfigured.  I read on a message board that people like me are not true fans, that we are not part of the musical elite that has been with Daft Punk from the beginning.  What a load of crap!  I've always liked Tron since I saw it on VHS in the early 90s.  Does that mean that I am more of a fan than someone who likes Tron Legacy but never seen the original?  Am I less of a fan than someone who the first Tron in theaters?    With that out of the way, it could explain why I love this album so much.  I saw the negative reviews it was getting and became compelled to defend it.    Is Reconfigured a perfect album?  No, but it is pretty darn good.  There are a few misconceptions that some of the reviewers have.  Please people, if you want to hear the version of Derezzed that you are so in love with, then buy the original soundtrack for TRON: Legacy.  As a remix album, I am expecting new and exciting interpretations of the music I am quite familiar with, and for the most part, this albums delivers.    Two of the biggest gripes I have read are against M83 & Big Black Delta's version of Fall and against Avicii's version of Derezzed.  Without surprise, these are mys favorites.  They sound nothing like the originals (there is a faint shadow of the original score), and they work well on their own.  They are fun, lighthearted, and they make me feel good, reminding me of songs from Discovery.  A perfect tribute to a style that once belonged to Daft Punk as they seem to be in a darker stage right now.    Only two songs keep me from rating this five stars: The Son of Flynn by Moby and End Of Line by Photek.  These suffer from the treatment that I suppose \\"die-hard fans\\" like, that is, they are very similar to the original score, but with extra drum beats and synthesizer effects slapped onto the music.  Because they are so similar to the originals, I would rather listen to Daft Punk's versions from the soundtrack....better yet, I would rather listen to the alternate mixes by Ki:Theory and Boys Noize.  They knows how to remix a song and make it their own.  Comparison to Daft Punk is hardly an option as they command the compositions and create an entirely new piece of art.    And the rest?  It's all good.  I especially like that they included Encom Part 2, which is not part of the single disc soundtrack.    For fans of Tron, Daft Punk, movies, and music - I definitely recommend this CD.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|The Tourist is gorgeous to look at, and not just the city, and I was really looking forward to seeing to fine actors play it up in an old-fashioned movie, but I was a bit disappointed.  I think it was the director's (Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck)  fault mostly.  Johnny Depp is one of our best actors and he could have played a great bumbling tourist, what we had instead was a hesitant portrayal of a guy who's English accent kept slipping out. I spent most of the movie preoccupied with wondering if Johnny Depp had spent too much time in Europe, to really get into the character.<br /><br />As for Angelina, always fun to watch and I feel a bit under-appreciated because her beauty is so distracting, she was never given a chance to do anything but wear nice clothes and look good.  Was the director too distracted by Angie's star power to tell her to feel something?  Was there too much press around the shoot for the actors to relax into their characters?<br /><br />The story line was a gift that was wasted on the director.  I couldn't help imagining how Clint Eastwood would have played up the tension of the situation, how he would have dirtied Angie up a bit and pushed her to a great performance as he had done in the Changeling.  And Johnny Depp, under great direction, could have redefined the whole bumbling tourist thing, as he did with Captain Jack Sparrow.<br /><br />What I felt was most lacking in the film any sort of intensity.  Compare Angelina in Mr. and Mrs. Smith, where she gives a knife's edge performance. Look at Johnny Depp in anything for the same thing.  I didn't see Depp come alive until the last ten minutes of the film.<br />Paul Bettany as a Scotland Yard detective is also wasted.  He's another fine actor who could have done so much for his role, yet again, it was like he was \\"phoning it in\\".<br /><br />The Tourist is a film that had all the ingredients, it just lacked a great chef.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004C445AG When I Dream]]

030746363X|4.0|If you are even remotely in touch or semi-well read of fitness trends / research, then there's nothing Earth shattering in this book. There are better books on specific topics though. For instance, The Paleo Blueprint by Mark Sisson is a better book on both fitness and nutrition than this book is. Similarly, sites like Leangains are better resources on fasting. The sex stuff is kind of useless if you ask me. All this said, it can be a great intro book on many of the subjects. Amazon's price is much better than Barnes & Noble or Borders. I don't regret buying it.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Am I a huge fan of the Foo Fighters? I wouldn't say so even if I find the band to be really enjoyable and liked some of their albums such as The Color and the Shape and In Your Honor. I'm not even that big a fan of Alternative music to be honest. In my humble reviewer's opinion, the Foo Fighters delivered 100% genuine and heartfelt rock'n'roll album, the band is honest and the music here is honest. And guess what? It rocks. It's been a little less than four years since 2007's \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace\\" (not to forget \\"Greatest Hits\\" in 2009), it's follow up and Foo Fighters' seventh studio album \\"Wasting Light\\" is released in 2011. Recorded in Dave Grohl's Garage (now really, how grunge is that?). Krist Novoselic makes a guest appearance and this album marks Pat Smear's first full Foo album since 1997's The Color and the Shape (not counting the 2006 live album \\"Skin and Bones\\". It's safe to say that this highly anticipated album will not disappoint the band's fans or curious newcomers!<br /><br />Let's go through some of the songs. \\"Bridges Burning\\" starts off the album nicely; a great rocker with a catchy chorus, the band delivers right away, what more can you ask? The album's first single, \\"Rope\\", has been receiving some airplay on radios around here and I just really like the song, very good performances by all musicians (love the guitars and drums at the beginning). To me what it is probably the best song and the highlight of Wasting Light is \\"Dear Rosemary\\" but while everyone has somewhat different favorites I feel this is one of the album's strongest tracks. I can't stop listening to this one.  \\"White Limo\\" is pretty cool, very metal, now talk about letting one's anger out, it's what it sounds like. I'm not a huge fan of the vocal effect here, and it's hard to understand the lyrics quite honestly but the song is very effective! \\"Arlandria\\" is an excellent slower-paced and very melodic song, the more I listen to it the more I like it! \\"These Days\\" shows very mature songwriting and despite being one of the album's slower song, has a lot of emotion and energy to it. \\"Back and Forth\\" is rocking and very catchy much like \\"Miss the Misery\\", both really good songs. \\"Walk\\" ends the album very properly and is reminiscent of early Foo, closes the album in a nice fashion.<br /><br />I find it really cool how Grohl included pieces of the master tape and put them in each CD. I was initially confused as to why I had such pieces but when I later learned what they were I was pleasantly surprised; it's owning a special part of the album.<br /><br />I won't go as far as saying that it's already a classic album or that it's the band's best album. All I can say is that I'm really enjoying the music here and I have to say that so far \\"Wasting Light\\" is one of the year's best releases, I was certainly NOT disappointed. The album has been receiving praises and rave reviews and rightfully so I believe, \\"Wasting Light\\" is an important album for the Foos and an excellent one as well. I wasn't too sure of what to expect of this new Foo Fighters album but they surpassed any hope I could have, truly an amazing album that I'm liking more and more with each listen. There is no talent wasted on \\"Wasted Light\\", the band we have here is a strong unit. This album doesn't reinvent the wheel but it doesn't need to, it's effective and reflects the band as they are today which is what it should do. I think I'll have to join the 5 star chorus on this one! 5/5.mature songwriting and despite being one of the album's slower song, has a lot of emotion and energy to it. \\"Back and Forth\\" is rocking and very catchy much like \\"Miss the Misery\\", both really good songs. \\"Walk\\" ends the album very properly and is reminiscent of early Foo, closes the album in a nice fashion.

159562015X|2.0|While the book was worthwhile, a vital part of the book's impact comes from taking their online survey and then utilizing the results.  WHEN YOU BUY THE BOOK USED, THE UNIQUE ONLINE PASSWORD IN EACH BOOK HAS ALREADY BEEN USED, and CAN'T BE USED AGAIN.  I'm not sure used booksellers are aware of this (I'm hoping they AREN'T: I'm getting the ball rolling by informing MY bookseller.)    Oh well, half the book DOES contain a good list of personal attributes: I'll fish through them and figure things out MYSELF...After all, I'm not a big fan of paying twice for a book I already own.

I am again amazed at his grasp of historical detail as well as the depth of his characterizations. I had read some of his earlier works, largely WW-II settings, and enjoyed them but nowhere near as much as these. I look forward to the continuation of this new series, and hope that the author is able to continue them to completion.
B0049JPU8A|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It is better than their first. I was actually expecting to hate the album because I think sophomore albums tend to be bad, but this one is beyond amazing. The songs are all good and what's so powerful about The Script is their song writing. The lyrics in each of the songs are thought provoking at truly heart touching. If you're a fan of The Script get this album, please!!
0061726826|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I was so happy with this book, the characters, every word, every page. I LOVED IT! I cannot wait until book 2. And I am serious. I am wanting it now! There was such a cliff hanger.. I mean u assume Alex died... BUT, it didn't actually say that so I AM LIKE OMG, there is still hope!!<br /><br />But ok...<br /><br />So you have Lena a 17 year old girl who lives in this world. A world where LOVE is the biggest problem. A disease. Not allowed. BANNED. They have a \\"cure\\" for this disease. Where they basically cut out 1/2 your brain. So that you basically wont feel any emotion at all. Your a robot. Nothing but a person who just lives life everyday basically doing the same ol same ol. You don't feel love, hate, sadness, anything. (that's what I AM getting out of this.. because how can you feel anything, all those feelings go with LOVE). The deliria is like the biggest crime to have. You will have an early procedure if you have it. Which is not recommended, because it can cause allot of problems. But even after the procedure some people just are NEVER the same.<br />I loved Lena. I loved Alex. I loved Lena & Alex together. I don't want to give away to much information. Because I think that it's important for you to go get this book if you don't already have it. Go to your shelf if you do. And read it, now! Because you will love it. OR at least I hope that you will. This is BY FAR my fave book so far in 2011! & I have the feeling it will stay in my top spot.<br />Have you read this book yet? What are your feelings on the book? I love how it has the little qoutes, or stories at the start of each chapter. And again.. I loved the BOOK!!
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Not only is this the weakest film, despite the length and despite the hype by all of those who are high on WB/Yates Kool-Aid, but its DVD is the worst packaged of the franchise, with no extras.  When it arrived in the mail yesterday from Amazon, I had to re-check the return address because I thought it was a bootleg copy that had been sent by mistake.  The sound and picture quality are sub-par as well.     I learned from reading the comments to other one-star reviews here that the sort of DVD release we have come to expect for a Harry Potter film (two-discs, widescreen, etc.) is only available from Walmart. Had I known, I would not have wasted my money signing up for a pre-sale from Amazon. Unfortunately, I opened it, so I can't send it back.    After watching it, I can say I am still not happy with the adaptation of this film from its source.  For all its length, it is dreadfully paced, seeming simultaneously rushed and draggy, and it has left out at least as many important themes and scenes as any of the earlier films.  Scenes are added willy-nilly, too, which is not in and of itself a crime, but only a crime when the tacky new material replaces the brilliant original.    Steve Kloves is no J.K. Rowling, and should stop trying to \\"improve\\" on the better writer's work.    ******SPOILER AHEAD******    The film cuts an important scene that is one of the first in the book, and that is the tete-a-tete between Harry and Dudley as the Dursleys depart from Privet Drive. That scene would have added so much more to the film in terms of character development than the film's made-up opening scene of Hermione erasing herself from her parents' photos and memories. Much has been made of that Hermione scene, but I was not impressed and thought it raised more questions than it answered. In the book, Hermione mentions in conversation how she transported her parents to Australia, changed their names, and wiped their memories clean of the idea they had ever had a daughter. In the movie, it seems that the parents remain in their English house. So what happens when the neighbors ask the Grangers about their daughter? Or did Hermione supposedly perform memory charms on all the neighbors, too? And how does simply wiping the parents' memories supposedly protect them -- or Hermione -- anyway; aren't they still vulnerable to Death Eaters who might want to hurt them in order to hurt Hermione, regardless of whether they remember her?      I am tired of people going on about how this scene brought tears to their eyes. I am as sentimental as anyone can be, but I found the scene bogus. For an authentic emotional statement, give me Dudley and his handshake and his \\"Dunno\\" and his teacup.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|When I saw this book in the bestseller's list, I liked the title. I read the back and I was interested, what I didn't do is read the amazon reviews, which was a BIG mistake. Sadly I cannot give the book more than 1 star. I can see the effort that the author put into writing it, but it just is a bad book. Period. Women (I cannot fathom men giving it 5 stars) who give it a raving review either don't have good taste in books, or like to read only the fluffy romances and call this the intellectual version.<br /><br />The characters and the storyline is set up, then abandoned completely. While the book is sooo important in the beginning, it doesn't even show up after a few chapters. The main characters go from strangers to lovers in a second, with no build up, no getting to know each other, no story progress. What happens next is a conjunction of random scenes that were better of in a tv show like Charmed. The main char is put in a castle, abducted, rescued, goes home, gets attacked again etc etc and while the world seems to have so many supernatural creatures (and many name drops), you only get to meet a small handful of them over and over.<br /><br />It is sad to see such a good idea outlined so badly and put together so clumsy. This could have been good, now it is just a story about nothing with most 1 star reviews being right about it's negative qualities.<br /><br />My recommendation: please read something else! It's a waste of time and money.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|Paul Simon continues to follow his own path, creating concept albums that are as unique and creative as anything you will hear in pop music today. With \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" he as weaved together a gorgeously colorful cloth of musical colors and all 9 songs (including one short instrumental) stitch together to make a musical and lyrical tapestry that rivals his masterful \\"Graceland\\" and \\"Rhythm Of The Saints\\". The opening number is the hook that grabs the listener and doesn't let go until the final, triumphant song. \\"Getting Ready For Christmas Day\\" starts the album off with a bang, a rhythmic riff on mortality that duets with an early 1940's recording of a Gospel sermon by Reverend J.M. Gates. This is a stunning example of recording art, where Simon's lyrics, his musicians and an old audio tape converge to  make a classic Simon song ; and it only gets better after that! \\"The Afterlife', \\"Rewrite\\",\\"\\"So Beautiful or So What\\" continue the lovely trend of percussion melded with witty, often oddly moving lyrics that marked the genius of \\"Graceland and \\" Rhythm Of The Saints\\". But there are softer sounds here, songs that are contemplative, somewhat mournful tunes but flecked with hope. \\"Love And Hard Times\\" and \\"Questions For The Angels\\" are reminiscent to a degree of Classic Simon ballads of the past, but understandably more mature in outlook. Frankly, writing a review or, in this case, a comment on this album seems rather futile because the reward is in the listening. Simon has remarked that this new work contains songs connected by a thread, hence his referring to \\"So Beautiful or So What\\" as a true concept album. As far as the current recording industry and the average listener is concerned, this enthralling record (forgive my anachronistic term) could possibly fall on deaf ears. But Paul Simon continues to have a fiercely loyal fan base , made of of what I suspect are baby boomers of a certain age, like Simon himself) who should get many hours of enjoyment along with some serious reflection listening to this gorgeous album. One final thought: \\"Love Is Eternal Sacred Light\\" is as propulsive and intoxicating a number as he has ever produced. Who cares if this album is denied Grammy Nominations (considering the sad state of affairs regarding that rewarding organization) : this is a flat out masterpiece.<br /><br />IN RESPONSE TO SOME READERS' REVIEWS WHO FIND THAT PAUL SIMON IS RAMMING HIS RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL VIEWS DOWN THEIR THROATS :<br /><br />Paul Simon has stated that he is \\"not religious\\". I have no idea what Mr. Simon's views on religion are,  his religious beliefs, etc. However, aside from the obvious fact that he writes compassionately regarding the human condition, I proffer that his use of religious imagery (angels, heaven, \\"the afterlife\\", eternal, sacred, light, celestial ladders : all that  emanates a great deal from his literary background. Simon was an English Major in College and it shows in countless number of songs he has written in the past 50 years. \\"Bleecker Street' is a prime example, where \\"holy\\" and \\"sacrament' are intoned by the beautifully blended voices of Simon and Garfunkle on the Wednesday Morning 3 A.M. album. Then there is \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", one of the great pop songs of the twentieth century, a song inspired by the great gospel singers earlier in the century and one song in particular, \\"Mary, Don't You Weep\\". Simon has worked closely and been influenced by gospel groups and the gospel \\"sound' is something that seems to energize his creativity in writing songs. On \\"Surprise\\" his previous work before \\"So Beautiful...\\" Simon movingly conjures up a surreal image of light passing through a church's stained glass window :<br /><br />  \\"And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by haloes of golden thread. The choir sang, \\"Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean\\". And all the old hymns and family names came fluttering down as leaves of emotion\\".<br /><br />Finally, there is one of the greatest songs he has ever written, on the \\"You're the One\\" album (2000). It is entitled \\"Love\\" and the song's final words are as apocalyptic, haunting and beautiful as anything he has written :<br /><br />  \\"THE PRICE THAT WE PAY<br />  WHEN EVIL WALKS THE PLANET<br />  AND LOVE IS CRUSHED LIKE CLAY<br />  THE MASTER RACES, THE CHOSEN PEOPLES, THE BURNING TEMPLES, THE WEEPING CATHEDRALS.\\"er written, on the \\"You're the One\\" album (2000). It is entitled \\"Love\\" and the song's final words are as apocalyptic, haunting and beautiful as anything he has written :                                                                                                                                                \\"THE PRICE THAT WE PAY                                                                                                                                                WHEN EVIL WALKS THE PLANET                                                                                                                                                AND LOVE IS CRUSHED LIKE CLAY                                                                                                                                               THE MASTER RACES, THE CHOSEN PEOPLES, THE BURNING TEMPLES, THE WEEPING CATHEDRALS.\\"
1600595871|4.0|This book is full of some excellent book projects.  I bought a copy of this book for everyone in my book making group and our goal is to teach each other how to make a book.  There are projects in this book that haven't been available to everyone until now.  Ms. Golden has tackled some of these projects and I hope that we we tackle them as well.  This is an excellent book for beginners as well as the more advanced book maker.
B004G600A4|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Now take into account that I am a 28 year old Disney freak, and am able to understand that this movie is NOT trying to send a message that says anything about poor mother/daughter relationships or thief boyfriends. The movie is rated PG, which means: Parental Guidance. I suggest that parents preview this movie before letting their kids watch it, and decide if it's appropriate for them or not.<br /><br />I loved the animation, the songs, the characters and the humor. I could watch this movie over and over again, and laugh and sing along every time. It is a must have for any Disney fanatic!
0670022411|3.0|I have slogged my way through about half of this, and have come to the realization that it is just going to be way too much work to finish it.  Note to ALL WRITERS OF FICTION FOR THE REST OF TIME:  possessive men who control their passive women because of a perceived need to \\"protect\\" them are not any more attractive because they are vampires.  That said, at least this book is better written than TWILIGHT.  Just needs an editor who's willing to get in there and slash.  Starting with the nine million mentions of the heroine tossing her straw-colored hair out of her face.    Not horribly written, and there are some good ideas here, but the repetitiveness of it is making me unwilling to continue.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Insidious is a well crafted and acted haunted house film, but it didn't quite pack the scares that the reviews I had previously read led me to believe. Don't get me wrong, sitting in a dark theater with the sound jacked up provided a couple of tiny jolts in my case, while a woman in the back screamed out loud at least once. Most of the scares are of the cheap variety (though some were very well done), but they are implemented with really loud sounds and music crescendos, so it does the trick more often than not. Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. In the right hands, in this case James Wan, it will have you bracing for impact whenever things get a little too quiet.<br /><br />The story is about a couple with three young children. They move into a new home and almost right away they know something isn't right. One of their sons goes into a coma of sorts and they learn that evil spirits are trying to break out through his unconscious body. I liked the \\"Poltergeist\\" approach of the son being haunted and not the house. No matter where they go, as long as the boy is with them, evil will be there as well. The first and second half of the film are so different, I think a lot of people will be split on which is better. I liked the slow building and rather typical haunted home vibe early, but I also thought the other dimension aspect and explanation used later was well done too, minus a couple of scenes that weren't pulled off to their full potential (like Darth Maul demon, hence the title of this review).<br /><br />If you haven't already, check out The Changeling with George C. Scott (or better yet, buy it here for less than $6.00). It's an often overlooked ghost story from 1980, but it proves the less is more approach is almost always more effective than the in your face technique. The s&eacute;ance scene alone is one of the most chilling I've ever seen. Insidious doesn't measure up to it, but I would still recommend watching it on a dark and stormy night, preferably with the lights off and your surround sound turned to 11.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 starsour surround sound turned to 11.      3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
0470876417|3.0|I really liked how the book is laid out. It is very readable and is definitely not boring. The information has been gathered by practical experts and therefore is quite useful. I also liked the logical structure of the book. The chapters flow very well. We used it for a few products we are developing and found very insightful gaps in our business model.    However, in the process of implementing the book, we also realized it does not talk about two important topics:  1. Competition  2. Risks    These are very important to any business plan and I am quite surprised why these topics are missing. We added these sections for our use. Perhaps the authors left this out for the second edition :)
B001UV4XHY|4.0|i've loved all of the books, but haven't always loved the movies.  The Deathly Hallows does not disappoint.  It moves along at a good pace, the effects are great and the story isn't butchered to death.  It is a bit long, but it wasn't tedious.  It made me anxious to see the next (and final) installment.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I don't have cable, so I just finally got around to watching this. It was worth the wait. As a fan of the graphic novel series, I'm happy the TV series is pretty faithful to it so far, but that Mr. Darabont gives his own spin to things to keep you guessing. This is as it should be since a carbon copy would be pointless and boring if you knew exactly what to expect. AMC also deserves credit for allowing the amount of blood and gore that's shown, which keeps the carnage realistic since a zombie apocalypse ain't pretty. Big kudos to Greg Nicotero and his company for the great zombie makeup and special effects. I think this may be the first time I've actually ever rooted for humans over zombies. Can't wait for Season 2.
B004PA50JM|4.0|After all these years, I was skeptical that R.E.M. could produce a good CD.  Well, they produced an excellent CD.  Those of us who grew up with R.E.M. will really like it.  I don't see it appealing to a younger generation.  I am THRILLED to hear Mike colaborate with Patti Smith.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I'm not going to bother writing a review of the movies contained within this box set, because you either know and love them or you WILL know and love them. However, I do want to point out that the toy box set, while creatively-designed, don't work particularly well for the discs contained within, as they are slotted within foam fittings that just don't compare to proper individual jewelcases.    Lastly, the region-coding: the movie DVDs are coded for the US, and while the Toy Story 1 and 2 Blu-Rays are encoded for all three regions, Toy Story 3 is Region A only.    Still, if you can play these movies, get this set.  I don't think it can be any more simply-put than that.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was amazing, I could not read it fast enough. Being a new mom it was so nice to have this treat of a book to look forward to during nap time and bedtime! I just wish the next book would come out already!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book the moment I started reading it.  It has witches, vampires, and daemons with a lot of history.  If you loved Outlander and Sookie Stackhouse books, you will love this. It is a great combo of both! I read it in 4 days and was so disappointed when it ended.  A wonderful love story with human emotion and great history tied with it.  You will not regret it!
0316069353|5.0|Five stars for entertainment and a couple of well done twists that were set up, but I didn't see coming. The plot doesn't depend on the protagonist doing something stupid.  The \\"trial\\" stretches a bit too long, especially some of the segments are unremarkable and there isn't much out-of-court \\"action.\\"  Halloran's irritatingly tolerant of his support staff's slips.    My 2 cents on the Kindle thing.  I like my Kindle and I don't like hauling paper around.  As of this writing, the Kindle edition is a little over a buck cheaper than the hardcover.  I hope Mr. Connelly and other authors will negotiate more favorable terms with their publishers for their readers who prefer electronic editions.  If not, they run the risk of going the way the music industry has... one person scans the hard copy to pdf, and zillions of people grab it off some server in the hinterlands.  In the end, that's not good for any of us.
0385738757|4.0|I have to admit, I'm way out of my usual reading material here.  As a result, I found some of the plot twists and scary monsters in this book a little over the top.  Loved the first 3/4's of the book, despaired in last few chapters that the story-line was deteriorating to hopelessly bizarre, but Dashner pulls it out.  Bring on Book 3!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|We have four Bruder construction toys so this review is going to show up in all four places.  These are all very well made, lots of details.  They are made of plastic and of course could be broken but they were thoughtfully designed and are reasonably durable.  The mirrors on the Mack dump truck are probably the weakest item, but if they were to break off the truck would be otherwise functional.  Toys break.  We took this as an opportunity to try to help our three year old grandson understand that a little care was required if he wanted these to last and he's responded well.  So far, nothing's broken on any of them, despite hours of use.    These all have so much intriguing detail that the kids are immediately drawn to them.  We have about a hundred buckeye nuts for them to push around and load without making a difficult mess.  They all have moving parts that allow them to perform their real world functions.  There are detents built in to hold position, so for example with the bulldozer, backhoe and front loader, the blades can be fixed and held in several different positions.    As far as toys go, these are a little pricey but even a three year old understands from the detail that these are different that the coarser, simpler $5 - $10 equivalents.  These clearly look like the \\"real\\" things.  We've all had a lot of fun with these.    They don't tell you anywhere, but if you look in the catalog, the front of this truck has brackets for a snow plow, unfortunately the marginal cost seems high at $20 so we passed.  This is a delightfully imposing toy.
B004OEIL54|3.0|Please note: I'm rating the release, not the movie (which is a favorite of mine).<br /><br />Save your money and wait for a complete, uncensored release, preferably with some new bonus material.<br /><br />***SPOILER WARNING***<br /><br />I broke down and picked this up because Amazon had it on sale for $6. Though not perfect, the picture quality is good/very good. The sound, on the other hand, is fantastic - one of the best DTS-MA tracks I've heard on blu-ray. However, despite all the audio and visual goodness on display, the admittedly small edits to achieve the \\"R\\" rating are annoying. The tone of the film changes subtly as a result.<br /><br />The slow-mo zoom at the end of the opening scene is far more effective than when sped up. A snipped second here and there in a number of other death scenes make them seem cartoonish and sanitized. Two characters appear to repeatedly stab each other with little consequence.<br /><br />If Scream were released today, it would surely receive an \\"R\\" in its uncut form. Compared to the likes of Saw and Hostel, the on-screen violence is positively restrained. Lionsgate dropped the ball on this one. Please don't wait another 15 years to fix it.
0312600844|2.0|After reading the Corrections many years back, I was looking forward to Franzen's next novel.  About 100 pages into \\"Freedom\\", I decided that I wasn't getting the enjoyment or mental/emotional stimulation I look for in a novel, and walked away.  Franzen is of course very clever, but in this effort, he is cloyingly so, to the extent that the novel is so precious as to be annoying.  And Franzen has such a myopically dim view of humanity and life in general that it soon became easy to predict what was going to happen next in terms of plot--the absolute worst possible thing, of course.      Like a more misanthropic episode of the 'Gilmore Girls', the novel appears to have been written by an angst-ridden Psych major grad student, and, worse, seems as if it was written for angst-ridden grad students.  The characters are barely distinguishable from each other; it's clear Franzen had a difficult time keeping them all from being one-dimensional mouthpieces to his singular mind.  And all the left-wing babbling about Marxism and population control and other things no one cares about anymore...jeesh!  Has this guy stepped foot off-campus in the past 20 years?  Perhaps my mind has matured from where it was when I read his last book, to the extent that I'm not longer the target-market for Franzen's whiny style of writing, but be forewarned that unless you are a fan of predictable, cry-baby literature focusing on First-World Problems, this book will probably leave you wanting.
0743289684|4.0|I read books either to be entertained or to learn. This book did both. But mostly, I learned. I learned what one woman can achieve even after enduring genital mutilation, an arranged marriage, beatings, the loss of having an identity. I learned about the world through the eyes of a Muslim woman in a world where Islamic faith dictates every move and thought. I learned about a girl who grew into a woman who had an open, questioning mind even when the answers went against centuries of tribal beliefs and would put her at odds with everyone she loved. My main guide in life is to remain true to myself. I am so proud of Ayaan for doing that in a world exponentially challenging than mine. A book worth reading!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I know, I know--Why haven't I read this or any other of Orson Scott Card's books when I am such a sci-fi buff?<br /><br />Well, now I am as hooked as all who have recommended him to me, and this series in particular. In fact, I have already downloaded the next book to my Kindle so I can get on with Ender's adventures. Yay! for REAL science fiction with space ships and planet hopping!<br /><br />The development of Ender's character and those around him was amazing and yet he remained as someone accessible. His thoughts seemed to echo the questions in the reader's mind.<br /><br />I know this is short for me, but I have a book burning a hole in my Kindle!

B0037KMHRY|4.0|A friend of mine let me borrow this CD to listen to.  This is a good electronic/synthesized soundtrack by Daft Punk mixed with orchestral music from the London Orchestra.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but I plan to some time.  Listening to this album makes me want to see the movie now.  There are a lot of good, moody songs on here.  Some of the songs are very upbeat as well.<br /><br />I recommend this soundtrack even if you haven't seen the movie.
B004GYY714|4.0|The variety alone makes this app well worth the download, especially for FREE!! My only complaints are: 1. Considerable buffering time, however I suspect it would be better with a wi-fi connection. 2. Quick drain on the battery, but that can be avoided by plugging it in while listening. This is definitely one of my favorite apps. Strongly recommend!
0765350386|5.0|I have really liked this book. It was a very entertaining book. The whole final empire idea where a single imortal overloard rules and most of people live as slaves was interesting. I have also liked the magic in this book that consists of burning metals. The charcaters were interesting, the plot develeoped fast a really good book

B001ADQXHA|5.0|Ok, this is going to sound cheesy, but I had to comment. This album is a classic and an absolute must for motivation when you need to get things done around the house (i.e. spring cleaning). Years back, this was my mom's crank-it-up album whenever deep house cleaning came around. I loved it. I play the album and can still smell the incense and pinesol, reliving happy times in the house I grew up in. Hey, I warned you it was cheesy. Be that as it may, I will always have a copy of this album on hand for whatever don't-wanna-do-it-but-gotta-get-it-done moments come up in life.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|I really want to own this book on the kindle, but I'm not going to pay $17 for something that is so full of errors.  I'm not sure what Amazon is thinking here.  Are they they trying to sabatoge the Kindle?  I'll wait for the $6.99 version thanks.
0756404746|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  The story line keeps you completely engaged throughout the book.  It was very difficult to put down.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Great movie but for some reason it tends to skip on my Samsung 3D Blu-ray player.  I checked the disc and it wasn't scratched.  Popped it into the PS3 and it played fine.  So it's either the disc or the player, not sure.  Either way, this stuff can happen with any disc.  I read reviews on this that the Blu-ray lack some content that the regular DVD offers.  I didn't really care about that as I just wanted the movie.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|The 2-disk (I have the DVD version, the Blu-ray may be the same) Criterion Collection edition is listed by Amazon with a run time of 162 minutes, but the commentary, and the display function agree that this is the full 180-minute version, not the 162-minute international release.<br /><br />Some of the reviews disparage the quality of the transfer to digital media.  The copy I received from Amazon shows no lack of resolution, and has vibrant colors.  What could have caused the negative comments is a mystery, unless there is truly a disparity in the quality between the 162-minute and 180-minute versions.<br /><br />I see no reason not to give the 180-minute edition all 5 stars.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|Most American's are familiar with the Civil War and its aftermath, but one of the lesser known aspects of the Civil War is the rounding up of conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and their subsequent trial, in particular the case of Mary Surratt. This is the story Robert Redford brings us in \\"The Conspirator.\\"<br /><br />The story in \\"The Conspirator\\" isn't one we're all unfamiliar with. A young inexperienced lawyer, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy) is assigned a client he initially thinks is guilty, Mary Suratt (Robin Wright) in a conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. As facts come to light and the prosecution obviously takes liberties in trying to hide evidence, pressure witnesses, and allow for only one viewpoint of evidence, that he slowly comes to the realization that while his client maybe guilty she isn't getting a fair trial and provides a more vigorous defense then at first thought possible. John Grisham has told this story many times.<br /><br />The movie is told from Aiken's point of view in his defense of Suratt, how it affects his life and relationships, and as his defense becomes more effective how he's exiled from Washington society and he starts to become suspect by his friends and the very people that appointed him to the position. In brief flashbacks we're also shown just enough of the conspiracy and the action of the conspirators that we can know what's going on.<br /><br />This isn't a glamor role for Robin Wright she barely wears make up, her lips dry and parched after being in prison for a month. She plays Suratt with matronly dignity expected of a woman of the age. James McAvoy gives a strong performance as a Union Captain who comes back from war and wants to return to his private life only to be thrust back into fighting, only this time in the courtroom. Kevin Kline's Edwin Stanton is absolutely ruthless in his pursuit of the assassins of Abraham Lincoln, and we're shown that ruthlessness almost immediately when he bars the distraught Mary Todd Lincoln from the President's side after he's taken from Ford's theater. In the supporting cast Evan Rachael Wood as Anna Surrat stands out, and Stephen Root, while having a small role always makes it interesting.<br /><br />Director Robert Redford shot this film beautifully, the gaslights glisten, and a couple of times looks like a Georges Seurat painting, perhaps in contrast to the cramped and war torn buildings most of the action occurs in and around.<br /><br />Yes, Redford's story has resonances and similarities to today's world, but history always will be relevant to the day, and the adage that \\"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\\" was never truer. \\"The Conspirator\\" reminds us of that history. But we aren't beaten over the head with a \\"message,\\" Redford gives voice to both sides of the argument, with Stanton arguing that all measures should be taken to roundup the conspirators and put in front of a military tribunal in the name of expediency in healing a nation torn apart. Aiken voices the other side of the argument, of why do we fight wars in the name of freedom and liberty if we're just to put them to the side? Although, Redford leans to the side of when the world changes the constitution shouldn't.<br /><br />I've read a bit about the Civil War, and thought Mary Suratt, while railroaded by Stanton, had known what her son and Booth were up to.

Lemmy and the boys went into the Inferno focused and looking to get HEAVY...And Inferno is HEAVY but its also full of great melodies and hooks. A truly inspired effort that ranks up there with Ace of Spades, Overkill, and Overnight Sensation.<br /><br />Best tracks:Killers, In the Year of the Wolf, In the Name of Tragedy, In the Black, Suicide.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I watched this movie at the movie theater and was pleasantly surprised, it was much better than my best expectation. The movie is ORIGINAL, the cast is FANTASTIC, and the story is FUN. This movie is the definition of a sleeper hit, I know many people who hasn't seen the movie at the theater or never heard of it, and all of them told me (after I recommended it) that this film is VERY GOOD and that they simply LOVED IT.    I highly recommend this movie, it will surpass your expectations. The quality of the image in the BD is excellent.

1440503257|5.0|I received this book for Christmas from a friend that knows how much I love the Harry Potter series. The recipes range from super easy (like how to cook bacon and scrambled eggs) to the more advanced (tarts and French pastries). Overall the recipes I've made so far have been really delicious. Several of the recipes are now family favorites (Molly Weasley's meatballs, beef stew with herb dumplings, Paddington burgers) that my kids request a lot. I've also cut down on the amount of oil used in some of the recipes without affecting the taste at all. For recipes like the puddings, I slice it thin so it makes more servings and pair it with fruit to make it a bit healthier. This is definitely a nice cookbook to have for anyone that likes the Harry Potter series and wishes to explore traditional British food.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|I am not one to write reviews, or at least ones with a lot of detail.  If your a Tom Petty fan then you will love this CD.  If you just like Tom Petty, then you need to give this a listen, it isn't your typical Tom Petty and the Heart Breakers, but it should be.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|500 Days of Summer is a corky love story movie that was directed by Marc Webb.  This movie actually makes a little sense in the world, it is a love story that people can actually relate to, and a love story that doesn't end with the man and women falling madly in love with each other just like ever single love story that is out there.  People get tired of seeing the same end of a movie over and over again but with this movie it is a little different than your average love story. Tom and Summer who are the main characters are coworkers who end up having a little fling with each other.  One character ends up taking this fling a little too serious while the other character doesn't believe in serious relationship.  The film jumps through time exploring the complex relationship between Tom and Summer, shifting fluidly as the audience slowly comes to realize just how complicated and unusual their relationship is. I love this movie and I give it all five star because I believe this movie is worth seeing over and over again. Hope you enjoy![[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]]

B000007177|4.0|There are some great songs here, although as other reviewers have noted, they were 'rejects' from earlier albums.  The songs are a lot of fun and include little known acoustic IA tunes such as \\"A Small Cigar\\" and \\"I Don't Want to be Me\\".  His voice is strong and similar to its 70s tone overall, but unfortunately the downside to this double CD compilation is some 1980s music, with all the attendant nasty synthesizers and loud, artificial-sounding drumming, etc.  \\"Hardliner\\" is one such song that was, and should have been, dropped.  However, this CD is well worth the price if you are a fan of mid-career Tull and don't mind the occasional yawn or two...
0452264510|5.0|Miss Brodie is a complex character as are the girls in her set (but then, aren't we all?).  Miss Brodie is likable, imaginative, snobbish, charming, cowardly, brave, and believes her influence on her \\"Brodie set\\" to be goddess-like.      Spoiler alert:  I believe Sandy took the steam out of Miss Brodie's goddess-like pronouncement and intent for Rose to become the lover of Miss Brodie's true love, Mr. Lloyd by herself (that is, Sandy) becoming the lover of Mr. Lloyd.  Thereby, Sandy overcame Miss Brodie and became her successor as well as the unknown and unappreciated savior of Rose.  Sandy \\"sacrificed\\" herself more unselfishly for Rose than Miss Brodie \\"sacrificed\\" herself (quite egotistically and selfishly) for her \\"Brodie set\\" in her (Brodie) \\"prime\\".

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I have seen many reviews on HDMI cables that mention all HDMI (low cost or high cost like Monster) deliver same quality as they simply transfer digital data. I disagree. I have 4 different brands of cables from Monster, Sony to generic low cost.  There is noticable quality difference, either with picture or the sound. Even two different HDMI cables by Sony that I have provide different quality. But this AmazonBasic cable definitely stands out on quality. Fantastic picture and sound quality. Bang for buck. Highly recommended.

1401207529|4.0|I've always like Frank Miller's writing and his Batman Year One proves that point.  Here we have a young Batman back from 12 years of traveling and training his mind and body to be Gotham's answer to the violence in Gotham.  His methods are flawed, he doesnt have a plan, the detective portion of his persona is not on display.  He is basically a guy with a bat suit with a vision.  Extremely well written story.

I still find myself almost haunted by the people I learned about - their stories - their triumphs and flaws.  The author's great style really makes you feel like you KNOW them.  You finish the book wishing you could have done something to help them AND realizing with wide-eyed wonder how this kind of thing could still happen today.  YOU REALLY NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!

B000IJ79WU|3.0|I just viewed this Richard Donner Cut I like the original much better. I won't say much but as Richard Donner said alot of the footage was lost and foound and someone re-edit this film together.  They use footage from the first film such as superman circling the earth real fast to put things back to where they were before the villains came, alls they had to do on those downtown New York shots is just reverse certain destructions and edit them into the film not a great affect. And Lois also forgets that she found out who Superman was. I like the idea in the orginal that he kissed her and she forgot. And also the guy in the diner after who punched superman after he gave his powers away. then he goes back after he turned time back and taught that diner guy a lesson, if time had really been reversed that would of never happened.<br />Well thats my take on it, the original made more sense I even liked some the dumb jokes when the villains where blowing everthing around like \\"the icecream cone someone was eating and the icecream flys off the cone and hit her in the face\\" and \\"when the guy is on the payphone it blows over and you still see him laughing and talking as the booth blows down the street\\" It might be campy humour. These Superman films were created with some of this tongue in cheek humour and it did work for the most part Thats All Thanks

B003UESJ9M|3.0|\\"Country Strong\\" is yet another example of how a film with a mediocre script can sometimes be elevated by a great performance. In this case, the performer is Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays troubled country music superstar Kelly Canter. In the beginning of the film, Canter is in rehab following a tragic public meltdown, and is taken out early by her manager/husband, James, who is eager to put Kelly back on the road to reclaim her once stellar career. In rehab, Kelly had become romantically involved with Beau, a younger singer-songwriter, and Kelly insists that her husband allow Beau to open for her on her tour. Since James has already committed to making aspiring singer Chiles Kelly's opening act, the three musicians all end up going on the road together, and the four main characters become entangled in a plethora of romantic and non-romantic drama.<br /><br />Paltrow is no stranger to playing self-destructive, troubled characters (she did play Sylvia Plath, after all), so I wasn't surprised at how well she pulls off her character's messy, volatile side. What did surprise me was how well Paltrow was able to portray a country music superstar. Paltrow, who is Hollywood royalty with a penchant for playing characters with British accents, is as far removed from a country girl as they come. And yet she is absolutely stunning at the climax of the film, when her character performs her triumphant comeback concert, and Paltrow is able to believably portray a superstar singer, wowing an audience of thousands of adoring fans, radiating charisma. It's long been known that Paltrow could sing, but her ability to actually perform as a singer is impressive.<br /><br />Regarding the rest of the cast, the results vary. Garrett Hedlund shows mega-watt leading man charisma as Beau, and handled the musical scenes quite well. But he perhaps relies a little too much on his charm and fails to connect with the character's supposed inner conflicts. Similarly, Leighton Meester is cute and charming and has a good singing voice, but never effectively shows her character's ambition and desire to run away from her troubled past.<br /><br />The whole film has the feel of a higher-end made for TV movie, full of pretty people with plenty of soapy melodrama. The film succeeds mostly as a showcase for Gwyneth Paltrow's acting and singing chops, and Garrett Hedlund's star quality.od singing voice, but never effectively shows her character's ambition and desire to run away from her troubled past.

There were even some characters in the book that I liked more now that I read the story.

B000148KK2|2.0|Not one of my favorite Krall recordings. Her singing voice may be an acquired taste. In my opinion she's a far better pianist than vocalist. Better that she stick to piano with the occasional vocal thrown in. Barbara Carroll, who's singing voice is also an acquired taste (which I have to say I acquired years ago) has it about right. Diana Krall should steer away from this stype of recording. I've played my copy of this CD only once and that's more than enough for me. To each his own.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|By far the best controller for the PS3. Sony's controller feels like it was made for 12 year old girls and it is a big reason I still buy multi platform games for the 360. MS got it right with their controller and for years I wished I could use it for my PS3. Luckily Power A thought the same thing and delivered. I do wish they carried over the 360's bumper and trigger configuration but it's something I can certainly live with.<br /><br />Those claiming this controller has lag or a bad deadzone are delusional at best. But more likely just some deranged fanboy who can't believe Sony messed up and someone did it better.<br /><br />I have been playing FPS since 1997 so I do have some experience when concerning hardware performance. Do your thumbs and brain a favor and buy one of these. I'll be using this until Razor gets their heads out of the sand and make a better one. I would say until Sony does but they can't even give us cross game and party chat so I won't hold my breath.

B002ZG99QS|2.0|My fiance had been begging to see this forever, when it finally came out on video, we just went ahead and got it.  Personally, I don't see what all the hype was about.  But then again, I have never seen the original.<br /><br />Kevin Flynn is a talented video game creator, best known for his game Tron. When he mysteriously disappears one night, he leaves behind a son who is now an orphan.  Now twenty years later, the son, Sam, isn't sure where he is headed in life.  He is bitter and disillusioned by his father and his company but then discovers a clue that may lead him to the whereabouts of his father.  In an old arcade, he discovers how his father entered the arcade \\"grid\\" and actually went inside the game as he too is now in the same place.  But he isn't really wanted there; an evil copy of his father is set on killing him and escaping into the real world.  But Clu, the copy, also likes playing games, and this world is one giant game.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Jeff Bridges: Kevin Flynn & Clu<br />Garrett Hedlund: Sam Flynn<br />Olivia Wilde: Quorra<br />Michael Sheen: Castor<br />Bruce Boxleitner: Alan Bradley<br />James Frain: Jarvis<br /><br />There wasn't much development to these characters.  They could have done so much to them, yet they fit into predictable stereotypes.  Father who is really kind and generous just trapped; son who is bitter and rebellious but quickly forgiving, etc.  It just seemed like they could have thrown some non standard quirks in there and developed the relationships better.  I was surprised to find out Olivia Wilde was Quorra; I completely didn't recognize her at all.  But honestly, she was probably the best character in this movie along with Castor just because he was so odd.  Clu as the bad guy wasn't very convincing.  He just didn't seem that menacing or really much of an obstacle.<br /><br />The cinematography was actually well done in this movie.  There were very nice special effects and I liked the whole motif of the lights that were throughout the entire film.  That being said, I think they spent so much time on making this film look fantastic that they failed to spend as much time on the plot.  I found myself getting bored with the movie quite often and hoping that it would end soon.  Which is never a good sign.  Even the music failed to impress; indeed, I barely remember it and nothing stood out.  I think that it failed in just being blah and bland with no new plot twists or exciting moments.  Sure the games parts were exciting, but really, they were a small portion of the movie that instead was given a bunch of substandard dialogue to fill a big portion of the time.<br /><br />Not the best.  Yes it is visually pretty but I like more than that in the movie.  It has to have some substance to.  Stick to the original (I hear its not too shabby) and only see this if you're looking for eye candy.<br /><br />Review by M.

But figuring that I was just overreacting to the shameless cover hype (Ursula, Robert, did you sell out?).  I soldiered through the filler, enjoyed the tarnish on the hero, sighed at the tarnish on the author, and give The Name of the Wind a three.   Wanted to give it a two just to compensate for one of the gushing enthusiasts who spouted a five.    Five?!  Tolkein, Cherryh,  Rowling, and Martin, not to mention LeGuin and Sawyer despite their judgement on this, must be way, way off the scale then.  The Wise Man's Fear?  Don't think I'll go there.

B0048EANOW|5.0|This was the best film made in '97 but like \\"Chinatown,\\" another noir, it is destined to become one of the finest movies not to take the Oscar home. Curtis Hanson took James Ellroy's novel, a book many doubted could be translated to the film medium, and crafted one of the finest adapted screenplays ever written. He then brought on board a couple of Aussie unknowns, a gorgeous star who had never lived up to her potential, and one of the finest actors working in film today. He then began filming one of the darkest noir films of all time in the blinding L.A. sun.<br /><br />The end result is a dark and twisted tale of personal redemption told against the backdrop of the bright lights and sunshine of Hollywood in the early 1950's. Hanson contrasted the brightly lit exteriors with Ellroy's dark storyline of police corruption and Hollywood decadence. This is a movie about facade, not just Hollywood's but our own personal front as well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe became a star as Detective Bud White, a tough cop willing to do whatever was necessary, which was in stark contrast to his politically minded colleague Guy Pearce. He finds Bud archaic, representing everything about the force he wants to change. What may stop him from doing so is his investigation into the murder of several people at The Night Owl cafe, one of whom is Crowe's partner, kicked off the force after a well publicized jail brawl christened given the handle \\"Bloody Christmas\\" by the papers.<br /><br />Crowe and Pearce come at it from different angles but the road for both leads right to beautiful Kim Basinger and a millionaire in the lush Hollywood hills played by David Strathairn. There is a reason Basinger looks a little like Veronica Lake the first time we see her in this film; she's supposed to. Hollywood legend has it that a string of expensive call girls were cut to look like stars during the 1940's and early 1950's and Hanson has made this darker side of Hollywood part of the story. Basinger is one of the lucky ones; close enough to the actual look of Veronica Lake not to have been cut on.<br /><br />Crowe falls for the real girl inside Basinger, but in spite of her opulent lifestyle, her low self-esteem comes to the forefront when she sleeps with Pearce in an attempt to \\"help\\" Crowe. We realize as she nearly destroys Crowe by doing so that she perceives herself as a whore on the inside, beneath the facade. Her logic is as twisted and tainted as the corruption Crowe and Pierce are about to uncover as they follow the trail linking Basinger's boss Strathairn to the Night Owl killings and the vice surrounding them on every side.<br /><br />Basinger may have garnered the Oscar for her role, but Crowe's performance as the tough cop with some soft spots after all is something you'll always remember. The coolest job done here, however, is by Kevin Spacey. Hanson told him before filming began to think Dean Martin and he'd have it down pat. Spacey did just that, playing the ultra cool cop, the one in the tabloids for his Hollywood connections. He is a consultant on the TV show \\"Badge of Honor\\" (think Dragnet) and is hooked up with slimy but likable Danny DeVito, a writer for a Hollywood tabloid. Spacey grabs the spotlight and DeVito gets the headlines as Spacy collars Hollywood stars in compromising situations, DeVito's camera flashing.<br /><br />Spacey seemingly has it all, but like the rest of this film, it is just a facade. While sitting in a bar listening to Dean Martin in the background he looks up into the mirror behind the counter and doesn't like what is staring back at him. He has all the tools to be a great cop but he knows he has sold his soul for the fifty in front of him. He becomes involved in the case because of a murder in a hotel room he feels responsible for that leads right back to the Night Owl, and hooks up with Pearce to redeem his soul. You will never forget the name \\"Rollo Tomasi\\" or what it means for Pearce, and ultimately Spacey in this film.<br /><br />Adding to the atmosphere more than just a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since \\"Chinatown\\" and just as haunting. It does more than help enhance the atmosphere, it truly is the atmosphere of this one of a kind masterpiece. This film has the kind of ending dreams are made of and someone holding up their badge to the oncoming rush of cop cars in the Hollywood hills at night is a scene you'll never forget.<br /><br />There is not a bad performance in this film. It is complex and riveting, and one you'll watch it over and over. It's all Off the Record, On the QT, and Very Hush Hush!st a little is the score by Jerry Goldsmith, his finest work since \\"Chinatown\\" and just as haunting.

0374158460|4.0|At this point (some 800+ reviews now posted on Amazon) and with all the praise that has been showered on \\"Freedom\\" from the New York Times to the New Yorker (any surprise they both loved it?), what I can offer is my reaction to reading this mountain of a book.<br />For me, it was an enjoyable slog (if that's possible).<br /><br />And I felt manipulated at the same time.  I felt like my face was being shoved into these people's lives. Franzen allows no distance.  You live with the bodily fluids of his characters and, in one case, with even more. There are feces smeared on the page (almost literally). Franzen forces his characters to handle them and, by extension, we are right there too, our noses down in the waste and the muck.<br /><br />And, at the same time, I listened on audio CD and found myself easily pulled along. There's internal and external conflict in abundance.<br />There are big themes, big ideas and three-dimensional characters with a whole big range of human emotions.  If Franzen set out to capture the zeitgeist of the Modern White Middle Class American, I'd say he succeeded in a Very Big Franzen way.<br /><br />But there are also Big Soap Opera moments.  No matter all the background and build-up, you can't overlook the clich&eacute; climactic fight between Walter and Patty.  \\"For God's sake, though, Walter, it was just sex,\\" she asserts mid-battle.  Of course we know it was much more than \\"just sex\\" because we know every morsel of her soul by this point (page 462). We know the all the self-destructive forces of all the characters because Franzen won't let us overlook them.<br /><br />He tells us everything.  There is never a moment when you wonder what these characters think.<br />\\"Feeling cruelly deprived, she turned off the television.\\"<br /><br />\\"Walter felt, himself, is his anger and disappointment with the world, like the gray northern woods.\\"<br /><br />\\"By finally venting his anger, first to Patty and then in Whitmanville, and thereby extricating himself from his marriage and from the Trust, he'd removed two major causes of his anger.\\"<br /><br />Writing schools tell you to \\"show don't tell.\\"<br /><br />Franzen's characters have emotions and feelings that have grown muscles. Then, he puts them in situations where they must bench-press 400 pounds or clean-and-lift 250.  Even in the case of hard-to-like Walter Berglund, who can't even be honest with himself about his own needs, his self-loathing is a powerful, well-chiseled force.<br /><br />In fact, the characters are hard to like but the story pulls you along.  There's a ton of sex--or yearning for sex.<br /><br />At the same time, there's too much back story in spots (for my taste); did we need to know, four-fifths of the way through, about Walter's father and his Swedish upbringing?  I didn't get it.<br /><br />The ending left me flat. Again, I felt too manipulated. There's a key death that happens off-stage and the impact (on Walter) isn't confronted head-on.<br /><br />By the way, did she have to named Lalitha? (Lolita?) Another example of Franzen's in-your-face power.  He's fearless, alright.<br /><br />OK, I'll say this: \\"Freedom\\" is unforgettable.

I'm really somewhere between three and four stars but on Amazon I see the one-star reviews are now outnumbering the five-star.    So, Franzen must need some love.    Here it is.

B0000009S3|5.0|i agree with another reviewer who said i wish more zappa albums were like this. it took guts for frank to do this at the time, but it paid off! fantastic and insightful work in zappa's career. the instrumental tunes (all except Willie the Pimp) are all pure zappa! if you've heard other instrumentals or instrumental albums by frank like \\"shut up n play yer guitar\\" or \\"jazz from hell\\", you know that he is a wizard of composition. he's a master at writing twisted music that is just fun to listen to. this album was still early in his career, and he honed his compositional style a bit more elegantly in later works. this album was still in the '60s ('69 i believe) and the straight-ahead blast with the long ugly jams thing was still more or less en vogue. even Willie the Pimp gets the vocals out of the way early in the tune so frank can dominate the last 5 minutes of the song with a guitar solo! sweet! of course, the best tune on the album is the nearly-17-minute jam, The Gumbo Variations, featuring the psycho-sax of Ian Underwood, hot violin of Sugar Cane Harris, and of course frank on guitar. freakin' awesome! it's worth the price of the album just for the Gumbo!! but, i'll admit one of the reasons i was interested in this album is because i'm a Jean-Luc Ponty fan, and i knew he made a brief appearance on this work. it only recently came to my attention that frank zappa was the man who convinced ponty to move to the USA after zappa saw ponty performing in a european jazz ensemble. zappa was so blown away by ponty's talent, he went on a major quest to convince ponty to move to LA so he could sign him up with the mothers. that would've been around the time this album was released. i'm a bit disappointed that on the only track on this album that features jean-luc, the violinist was not allowed to step out and show off very much....especially after the blazing solo Sugar Cane did on Gumbo, but i can't hold any major grudges. as always, ponty played wonderfully. this is a supurb nearly-instrumental zappa album.....clearly done in the late '60s, with zappa already developing his gift for brilliant but twisted composition, fantastic jams....Underwood, Harris, Ponty and Gumbo Variations and a pimp! this is truly a 5-star album!urb nearly-instrumental zappa album.....clearly done in the late '60s, with zappa already developing his gift for brilliant but twisted composition, fantastic jams....Underwood, Harris, Ponty and Gumbo Variations and a pimp! this is truly a 5-star album!

B004WPIJ4I|5.0|I loved this song from the first time I heard it yesterday.  While it took me a little while to warm up to \\"Born This Way\\", \\"Judas\\" is an instant classic.  It isn't often that you hear a contemporary pop song that makes you think, but Lady Gaga has created just that with this song, and it's one of her finest.  The churning house beat is stunning and it makes you want to dance.  Of course, there's bound to be much controversy because of the religious symbolism in \\"Judas\\", but people have refused to really LISTEN to lyrics since the beginning of music and they will continue to do so.  If anything, the fact that Gaga has been condemned by Catholic groups for this song and others only makes her more fascinating.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|If  you are not a fan of psychological thrillers and such then this may not be your cup of tea, obviously the shallow minded one star reviewers mostly don't like this type of flick. (other than those who though this was a movie about the love of dance! and were shocked to get this type of movie) but ignore them anyways this is a great movie about the psychological dance that we must all face in life. Only this is even more extreme in that it's about a woman pushed over the edge to succeed.  She has to deal with a overbearing mother among other things and that's never a good thing. THe blu ray looks great and Natalie deserved best actress all the way for this  movie. It's not a easy  movie to watch , nor should it be as movies about mental illness are never pleasant. Still it's worth the effort because of the story of how this dancer is consumed by her artform among other things. You must watch this with that attitude or perhaps get lost. This isn't a feel good movie but it's a intriguing one and that's well acted and it is not traditional hollywood fair in the least. Which is why those with small attention spans need look elsewhere.  Get the blu ray if you want this one.
B004W5T2RG|4.0|I'm not a huge country music fan...  Let's get that out of the way.      This is a really good movie.  Solid story that reminds me a little bit of the original Pure Country.      Guys, surprise a lady friend by renting this one.  Trust me.  You could jam raw oysters, spanish fly, and Cialis for women in a blender and it won't work as well as this movie does.    The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was for the shortened song at the end.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I hesitated getting this show because the cover didn't look interesting.  That saying, \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" couldn't be more true for this show.  d:      The good:  It has a feel of Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" meets \\"The living Dead.\\"  The acting is good and the story is even better.         The bad:  Season one was only 6 episodes long.  Not nearly long enough for a full season.      Overall, this show is worth watching.  I highly recommend it.
0756404738|4.0|Creating an epic fantasy protagonist is like answering job-interview questions: the trick is to create flaws that are not-so-secretly strengths, adding quirks and idiosyncrasies that make one's hero more impressive rather than less. Patrick Rothfuss has passed a Google-level interview with his trilogy's hero Kvothe, a young hothead with a list of accomplishments and abilities as long as his arm but also a carefully calibrated set of disadvantages (very young, redheaded, from the Gypsy-esque traveling folk of this continent, poor, orphaned) that serve primarily to make him even more impressive to the reader.<br /><br />Rothfuss introduced Kvothe in [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind]] four years ago, which immediately grabbed him a large and appreciative audience -- and no wonder, since it was a compellingly readable coming-of-age story with an iconic first-person narrator and a frame story that dribbled hints of things to come (both triumphs and tragedies) in the way that prophecy-loving fantasy readers immediately jumped on. NAME OF THE WIND was also a big book, full of exciting scenes, and secondary-world fantasy readers seem to still value size over everything -- size of book, size of protagonist's ego and abilities, size of scale, size of anything that can be measured. So Rothfuss had an almost immediate fanbase, which, as always, wanted to know how quickly they could expect the next book.<br /><br />It took longer than expected, but THE WISE MAN'S FEAR hit stores last month with an even larger thump than NAME OF THE WIND did. (The new book is just shy of a thousand pages, and those pages have substantial numbers of words on them -- again, size is a huge bonus in this market.) And it's very much the same kind of book as NAME OF THE WIND was -- a little bit of frame story, in which an older Kvothe is seen, reduced to sad and unlikely circumstances, telling the tale of his much younger days, and in which Rothfuss throws out as many as a dozen dark hints a page as narrative anchors for the stuff he'll write later or, perhaps, leave as hints if he doesn't manage to get to them; and then a whole lot of \\"when I was young\\" stuff. In the main text, Kvothe only ages about a year -- he's still in his mid-teens, and one begins to wonder if this series will burst beyond its promised trilogy (as so many others have), or if that last book will appear in twenty years as a 10,000-page e-only monster. In keeping with Rothfuss's teasing narrative strategy, most of the events the reader is anticipating happen later in Fear than expected -- if they happen at all. (See elsewhere on the Internet for the blow-by-blow details of those; like most popular secondary-world fantasy, there are now multiples of words written about this series than there are in the books themselves.)<br /><br />Rothfuss has an admirable control of scene and tension for a guy only on his second novel; this is a very big book with an overgrown \\"and\\" structure (\\"first this happened, and then this happened, and then...\\"), but it feels structured and moves at a controlled pace at all times. It is huge, though, meaning that all readers will not view all parts of it as equally necessary, and some sophisticated readers may begin to wonder if Rothfuss is just going to keep tossing out hints and not bothering to follow up on them. The frame story is more intrusive in this volume as well, and more obviously counterpointing Kvothe's stories about his youth. (Though there's still no evidence at all that Rothfuss wants us to doubt a word Kvothe says; he's a deeply reliable narrator, as usual in this genre.)<br /><br />In the end, this series -- Rothfuss has grandly titled it \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles,\\" based on yet another exploit of Kvothe's that we have gotten only the faintest reports of so far -- is a strong entry in the traditional Tolkeinesque secondary-world fantasy genre, but doesn't transcend that genre. Kvothe is an engaging narrator -- I almost wrote \\"endlessly engaging,\\" but that might be too much of a temptation to the already-given-to-great-length Rothfuss -- and his story is one of the better epic fantasies that you could find. But it doesn't push the genre in ways that Steven Erikson or George R.R. Martin do; it just settles into the middle of the territory to tell the story it has.f a temptation to the already-given-to-great-length Rothfuss -- and his story is one of the better epic fantasies that you could find.

B003UESJ9M|2.0|I really tried to give this movie a chance folks. I even watched it the whole way through. As a big fan of the late Tug McGraw I looked forward to this movie as a chance to launche his sons Tims acting career into the mainstream stratosphere; unfortunately I was sadly disapointed. This was a movie that failed because it tried to fit too many animals on one boat, the loss of a child, a failing marriage, substance abuse, rehab, country music, and more romantic story lines than a day time soap. Tim's great acting potential was hemmed in by a script that required he play the most wooden character I've seen since I watched Mr. Rogers as a kid. Although this movie was out of focus, I due look forward to Tim McGraw taking on larger more serious roles on the big screen worthy of his acting prowess.
B004W89LS8|5.0|The Foo Fighters latest album rocks from the first track.  It seems as though RCA finally got some new recording equipment as it sounds like they actually put some treble in this recording.  Don't worry, there's plenty of Low End as well.  For me, most RCA albums sound as though they have very little on the High End.  I usually have to put a little more in equalizing them.  Listen to the past Foo Fighters albums and you'll see what I mean.  I know this one was recorded in Grohl's studio and it's a very good thing.  RCA needs to go back and remaster their complete catalog.  Well, if you're a fan of the band, be sure to get this Deluxe Edition.  I got it at [...] for $[...].  This is second only to The Colour and the Shape.  This will be a great tour to see.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|Radiohead is by far my favorite band.  That said, this album (in my opinion) is tied for 4th place:  1:  OK Computer, 2:  The Bends, 3:  In Rainbows, 4th:  Kid A and King of Limbs.  This album is perhaps one of the most experimental ones yet (other than Amnesiac and Kid A).  So, I've rated this album as an artistic tie with Kid A, and you're wondering why...  First of all, the album is really two in one.  The first four songs are a combination of Kid A and Amnesiac, while the second four songs are a combination of In Rainbows and awesomeness.  It's simply complicated music that makes so much since you can't deny the brilliant significance of its allure; if this album were a woman it would be among the most gorgeous you've ever seen.
B001E45XT4|2.0|I purchased these headphones to use with my Xbox so I wouldn`t disturb my wife when playing. I had high hopes from reading other reviews but I am disappointed with the comfort. The sound is fine and I can still hear the game while my wife is on the phone right beside me. The ear cups don`t swivel and they put a lot of pressure on my ears. Someone compared them to a vise on your head and I have to agree. They are also heavy and hurt the top of my head after a short while. I haven`t tried the Mic. The volume control wheel could be easier to turn, and is a bit large & heavy.  Don`t buy if you have a large head.
B002N57KG2|4.0|My sons (ages 13 and 10) and I watched THE CANNONBALL RUN recently, as part of their general film education. (You folks can show your kids whatever movies you want; I'm going to focus on the stuff I saw as a kid -- it clearly didn't hurt me, did it?)<br /><br />We're right in the middle of the Hal Needham/Burt Reynolds cluster of car-chase comedies here, after two [[ASIN:0783229356 Smokey & The Bandit]] movies and [[ASIN:630516200X Hooper]], but before [[ASIN:6305133441 Stroker Ace]] and its own sequel. And we're also right at the point where the '70s turned into the '80s, with the gleeful anarchy of the National Lampoon years ([[ASIN:B0000A02TZ Animal House]], [[ASIN:B000OMD3K8 Meatballs]], etc.) starting to turn into the crisp-and-slick sheen of the Reagan years. It's not a bad movie, but it's a silly little movie, and if it were a racehorse it would have been sired by [[ASIN:B0000CBY1C It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]] out of SMOKEY.<br /><br />If you don't know the set-up -- in which case, I hope you're as young as my sons, or spent most of your life other than in North America -- it's pretty simple: there was a real, essentially \\"outlaw\\" cross-country race in the '70s, from the New York area to a Los Angeles suburb, and this movie is the officially-licensed comedy version of those races. A bunch of odd teams -- Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. dressed up as priests in a Ferrari, Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw (and a half-ton of Budweiser) in a painted-over NASCAR vehicle, two guys on a motorcycle, Jamie Farr as a random Arab sheik, and so on -- compete for glory and a big check, by driving as quickly as possible across the country. Our hero is Burt, of course, and his sidekick is Dom DeLuise. They're driving an ambulance, so, for reasons never quite stated by obvious enough for a comedy like this, they need both a doctor and a patient. The former is Jack Elam, in one of his late bug-eyed comedy roles, and the latter is Farrah Fawcett, in a tight shirt and no bra.<br /><br />A series of gags and car-chase scenes follow, though very little that could be described as a single, coherent plot. But who wanted that, anyway? Eventually, everyone makes it to California and the end of the race. Again, this is a silly comedy, very much of its time -- but that was a fun, easy-going, big-smile kind of time in America, and there's nothing at all wrong with that.gags and car-chase scenes follow, though very little that could be described as a single, coherent plot.

B004RQDQIQ|5.0|\\"Miller's Crossing\\" has long been one of my favorite Coen bros. movies. Everything about it is first rate, from the crackling, sharp-as-a-tack dialog, to the look of the film, to the music, to the fine performances, everything about it is true to the period.

The story had great pacing and many great elements that make Doctor Who one of the greatest Sci-fi series' around. If you like Doctor Who books or just the Tenth Doctor, give this book a chance. I am sure you'll fall in love with it.

B002ZG98FU|2.0|Several times while The Wife and I were watching MORNING GLORY, the Blu-Ray quietly skipped ahead a chapter or three, jumping over twenty minutes or so at a clip. Sneakily, it repeatedly tried to do that by jumping between scenes that both featured the young heroine (Rachel McAdams) having a meeting with her boss (Jeff Goldblum). When the movie itself tries to tell you, \\"You don't really want to watch this,\\" it's not a good sign. Possibly worse, we didn't realize the first jump had happened until the second one hit -- and didn't really miss the twenty minutes in which the movie laboriously explained how McAdams went from a minor producer on a minor early-morning cable show out in the wilds of New Jersey to running the big morning show for what's supposed to be one of the Big Three networks in New York.<br /><br />MORNING GLORY for a long time looks like it's going to become yet another story in which a hard-working young person learns to quit and slack off for the greater glory of her soul, but ends up slightly less cliched than that in the end. McAdams is painfully perky, and has the unrealistic klutziness that modern movies use to telegraph that she is the female lead in a romantic comedy, but she does work hard, and she does mean well. Her job, basically, is to drag that morning TV show away from the bottom of the ratings, and her great hope of doing so was to team gruff, grizzled veteran newsman Harrison Ford (playing it by finding the least likable aspects of Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, and Andy Rooney) with the existing female host of the show, Diane Keaton.<br /><br />And, in a movie made two or more decades ago, the relationship between Keaton and Ford would be the center of the movie -- it *should* be the center of the movie. But it's not, because the big face at the middle of any movie poster has to be young and perky, so McAdams is shoehorned into every scene. Oddly, her own relationship -- with the nearly colorless Patrick Wilson, there primarily to be the hunky guy who she clearly deserves and so doesn't need to have any characterization of his own -- is mostly filled in through implication and allusion, as if the movie couldn't be bothered to actually have a romance in its romantic comedy.<br /><br />So MORNING GLORY is shiny and obvious and constructed entirely according to formula: it's a Hollywood romantic comedy; we all expected that. Keaton and Ford are good in it -- though they could have been much better if the movie were allowed to be about them, and not the random young klutz wandering through their lives. And -- even though I kept a beady eye on the time-code on my disc player throughout the second hour of the movie -- I kept getting the feeling that I was still missing scenes, and this time they were scenes that didn't make it into the movie at all. In any case, MORNING GLORY won't thrill anyone but died-in-the-wool Harrison Ford fans, but it won't offend anyone but the most Milquetoast of Dubuque grandmothers, either.he clearly deserves and so doesn't need to have any characterization of his own -- is mostly filled in through implication and allusion, as if the movie couldn't be bothered to actually have a romance in its romantic comedy.

B0034G4ORM|1.0|Luckily I bought this movie as a bootleg on the street for USD 1.25 - but you know what? I still took it back in disgust. I threw it at the guy and told him to stop selling that title.<br /><br />I think it's the worst example of corporate film making ever...  Science fiction is supposed to have some kind of like science... ? Avatar, was good because they actually thought about the stuff to not make it ... you know mind blowingly STUPID.<br /><br />SPOILER -<br /><br />The alien army has crossed interstellar space to steal the oceans because 'liquid water doesn't exist anywhere else in the known universe' ??? Are you kidding? Was the science team from the 1940's?  of don't they think anyone pays attention if enough stuff is blowing up.<br /><br />James Cameron hired professors from MIT, Harvard, Berkley and god knows where-( exo - biologists, linguists, future tech guys etc).  And they developed a compelling and novel vision of the future and an alien world that is also plausible. Avatar good/ Battle for LA - BAD.  I noticed in the credits that Levi Johnston was given a credit for 'Research and Book Lernin'. Really too bad because the idea of an advanced alien force trying to conquer earth could be fun to watch if someone had given it any kind of thought.<br /><br />If you have an interest in film or becoming a film maker watch this movie and learn how bad a movie with no point but making money can be. Someone might have wanted to make a war movie here but the execs said it'd take in more money if it was mixed with Independence Day and Cloverfield.  I read the un-cut version actually also has a lavish wedding thrown in - that's what the early scene in the flower shop is setting up - Anyway it wound up on the cutting room floor after a lot of debate because it made the movie run over optimum length for seat turnover in multiplexes Thurs-Saturdays -  but that scene will be back in the Directors Cut DVD- lots of soul searching in the creative team on this issue since the female 16-35 year old viewer demographic has a very strong affinity to weddings with high end product placements.  Just messin around but this has to be the kind of creative process that turns out this junk.<br /><br />The story is predictable and doesn't have one original idea or character.  I'll give the actors credit for trying to make this junk work but it was an impossible task.  Special effects?  Good but nothing ground breaking.  Certainly they don't save the movie.  I can't get over the awful writing here - we have the old standard characters with issues that were old and tired in the 1970's - the Staff Sargent who lost his squadron over Macho Grande and has lost his nerve.  They guy who is going to get married and looks moonily at a picture of his wife to be,  The kid who wants to get home and drive his Mustang until the wheels fall off.  Then their is Tex and  Brooklyn and Lagos ( ok the Nigerian soldier was something I'd never seen before, didn't have any real significance.  Assuming they owed an actor with a Nigerian accent a job.)  Oh and the fiesty hispanic helicopter pilot from Avatar is back playing the exact same character- seriously<br /><br />Is it a patriotic movie??  No, just stupid.  Stupidity is not patriotism although they are more and more confused recently.  I saw one reviewer saying this was a 'kick ass Marine movie!'  - dude Marines aren't one dimensional stereotypes from cheesy 1950's movies.  This is an insult to all Marines.  The idea of trying to jam serious drama and soldier's deaths into this pointless money making vehicle is insulting.  The movie toys with serious themes by accident or left overs from some better script.. ?  They have the US Marines hiding from robotic alien drones.. but it doesn't really mean anything they don't explore that angle at all.  The aliens are semi robotic rip offs of District 9, so the parallels to Afghanistan or Iraq go no where.  The talking head in the film and the ads who goes on about 'An occupying army must exterminate the local population' - WTF?  The US is  an occupying army and we're not exterminating Iraqis and Afghans.  If anything a lot of soldiers are dying because our rules of engagement are designed to error on the side of not killing civies.  Again this whole aspect could have been interesting if written and directed by other people as is it's border line offensive.<br /><br />I'd heard a lot of talk about this move.. not telling me it was junk... so I watched to the end waiting for some Sixth Sense type surprise at the end...like the aliens were us from the future?  anything ....  nope...

0143038419|1.0|My mom bought me this book as I'm planning a trip to Italy in the fall. After reading through the first half of the book, I won't be investing any more time in this garbage. The other 1 star reviews pretty much sum it up: the writer is a spoiled, depressed, uninteresting person that I truly do not want to know. She clearly sails through life with ease and yet every chapter is about how she is depressed or how her surroundings do or do not compound her depression. I really don't care. Her one-sentence critiques of historic monuments and millenia-old cities reflect the impression a 13 year old might have, while we are subjected to a few chapters on her BORING enlightenment and personal details. Skip this and don't put any faith in Oprah's Book Club.
0865479186|4.0|The subtitle here is \\"Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacks,\\" which explains the proceedings a bit better than the expansive title does. Author Goldacre was a doctor before he was a writer -- or is a writer primarily about things that bother him as a doctor -- and so this book isn't about bad science in general, but a very particular kind of bad science. If it were completely accurate, it would have been named Bad Medicine, but, sadly, Bon Jovi got there first. Goldacre is also British, so the things that annoy and incense him are the idiocies of the great British public -- other countries have their own, distinctive idiocies -- particularly homeopathy and the great vaccination-causes-autism scare.<br /><br />To go along with his quite British targets -- Goldacre is also grumpy about multinational pharmaceutical companies, though he tries to maintain a consistent clear-eyed-and-resigned tone throughout, and tends to downplay their sins, since they're not nearly as idiotic as the other nutters he writes about -- BAD SCIENCE has a deeply British tone: aggrieved, but assuming that the world will always aggravate him; casually cutting and full of wit, though not \\"witty;\\" off-handedly authoritative; and a sense that things will always be pretty bad, but that we'll muddle through nevertheless. So BAD SCIENCE begins with the clearly demented tenets of homeopathy, and works its way up the ladder of medical misconceptions through biased tests and shelved results -- again, he's complaining more about \\"Complementary and Alternative Medicine,\\" that latest euphemism for snake oil, but he also explains along the way how more conventionally scientific data is tweaked and twisted and tarted out to show whatever unscrupulous researchers want it to show.<br /><br />There is no physics in BAD SCIENCE, and the chemistry and biology here are exclusively concerned with the health of the human body. There are vast, uncharted fields of horrible science that Goldacre doesn't come anywhere near explicating. But, what it does -- carefully pointing out the major ways that the UK is misled, and misleads itself, about its health and the care thereof -- it does well.But, what it does -- carefully pointing out the major ways that the UK is misled, and misleads itself, about its health and the care thereof -- it does well.
B001U7B4T8|3.0|Anyone like me, who owns the VHS tapes from this 1992 concert in Madison Square Garden titled Bob Dylan, The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration, Volumes I and II will likely be bitterly disappointed to learn that many of the great performances on the VHS tapes are missing from this DVD.  Most tragically, the best performance by a medley of musicians and singers ever recorded is missing.  The first verse of My Back Pages on Volume II of the VHS tapes is sung by Roger McGuinn, the second by Tom Petty, the third by Neil Young, the fourth by Eric Clapton, the fifth by Bob Dylan and sixth by George Harrison, and includes some incredible guitar playing by Eric and Neil.  This rendition of My Back Pages is unsurpassed for the stature of the performers, its quality and the way it moved the audience. 15 performances from the VHS were cut from the DVD, including Lou Reed singing Foot of Pride; June Carter Cash and Johnny Cash singing It Ain't Me, Babe; Kris Kristofferson singing I'll Be Your Baby Tonight; Johnny Winter's version of Highway 61 Revisited; Neil Young's rendition of All Along the Watchtower; Chrissie Hynde's excellent performance of I Shall Be Released; Eric Clapton on Don't Think Twice, It's All Right; and a wonderful singing of You Ain't Goin' Nowhere by Mary Chapin-Carpenter, Rosanne Cash and Shawn Colvin. Thankfully, the DVD does include Eric Clapton's amazing performance of Love Minus Zero/No Limit, which I would offer as some of the strongest existing evidence that he is the greatest electic guitar player ever.  That performance alone makes this DVD worth the purchase price, and you'll get George Harrison's Absolutely Sweet Marie, Neil Young's excellent version of Just Like Thom Thumb's Blues and the Band's great job of When I Paint My Masterpiece to relieve some of the pain for all that's missing from this DVD.  There is still a huge opportunity for the makers of rock concert DVDs to recreate in DVD format all that is on the VHS tapes.
B002ZG981E|2.0|I watched this last night. I enjoyed Christopher Nolan's first Batman film but found the Dark Knight to be rather messy, plot-wise, and Heath Ledger's brilliant Joker not enough for me to paper over some of the redundant scenes and illogicalities. But I also enjoyed The Prestige, even if it was spoiled a little for me by some dubious plot devices. So, I thought I'd give this one a go, at least.    Now, from having read some reviews, I suspected I'd find the mechanics behind Inception hard to follow; but I didn't mind that. As long as the main story was strong and the characters interesting, I could surf along on the complexities of the world-settings. However, that is ultimately my problem with this film: that the story is not engaging enough and the characters shallow.     Basically, we have a group of thieves working for a huge company which wants to take business from an even bigger company. Why should I care? (Throwing in an aside that the bigger company will dominate the world's energy supplies and that's not a good thing, simply alerted me to the lack of empathy points in the story.) Cobb wants to get back to his children - so what? He's not especially likeable or even interesting. As for the motives of the rest of his team, they don't seem to amount to much more than wanting money or in one case being able to experiment with dream structures, just because.    Hence, while the music thunderously and endlessly exhorted me to feel the tension of the chase towards the end, I actually felt stranded, not caring very much if they succeeded or not in planting an inception in the young business guy's head (someone who actually seemed quite decent - although it's difficult to tell if the script intended me to think this or not).    So, without much of a story and paper-thin characters, what's left are some admittedly stunning special effects. However, even those I found difficult to fully enjoy because I never quite settled to what was causing them. Now, I'm ready to be shot down by more attentive viewers here, but were the workings of all this dream-manipulation ever really explained? All they seemed to comprise was a Naked Gun style tin briefcase with some cables that are attached to the sleepers' bodies. But how does that get them into other people's dreams? Yes, I know about suspension of belief but in such a sombrely portentous movie, you expect a more realistic explanation for its main plot device. Otherwise, you might as well have them wearing foil helmets with antennae (which actually would have been more fun).    For me, this film doesn't work because it wants to be both an action, plot-driven movie and something more intellectually challenging. Batman Begins worked because the imperative of the origin story meant Mr Nolan had to keep the plot prominent. When he was given more story leeway with The Dark Knight, story vs 'art' ambiguities water down the narrative drive. At least for me.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I actually make it a requirement for anyone working with our son, who has autism. Temple Grandin is an amazing woman and HBO did a wonderful job bringing her story to the big screen. Even though my son isn't much like Miss Grandin at all, this movie did help me understand what MAY be going on inside his head. I think its great for anyone that works with individuals who have autism.
B002LB6EJM|5.0|If you know and love Miles Davis from the late 1950s `Kind of Blue' period but haven't heard anything recorded under Julian `Cannonball' Adderley's own name, you're likely to love and appreciate `Somethin Else.' It's the perfect Blue Note companion to KoB and in the same groove, with superlative playing throughout from Adderley on alto sax and Miles on trumpet together with Hank Jones on piano, and a rhythm section made up of Art Blakey on drums and Sam Jones on bass.<br /><br />It's difficult to pick out highlights on a collection so uniformly excellent, but the 11-minute opener `Autumn Leaves' is a true jazz classic which you'll think you've always known, so recognisably familiar is the melody. The title track, showcasing the horn interplay between Miles and Cannonball chasing each other all over the scales in an exuberant and up-tempo duet sounds like a cut which escaped from the KoB sessions, and `One for Daddy-O' with its slower tempo and stand-out uncomplicated melody also shines. In the sparse, clean and bluesy `Dancing in the Dark' we hear Cannonball at his soulful best, his horn soaring with a long, slow-tempo solo over a perfectly understated rhythm.<br /><br />The music here is instantly accessible, with nothing unnecessarily complex or jarring. You can listen to the album again and again, no matter what you're doing, though one or two of the numbers are perhaps a little up-tempo for dinner-party background ambience. Overall `Somethin Else' is an indispensable jazz classic which stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best of Miles, Trane or Charlie Parker.<br /><br />The nickname `Cannonball' BTW came from a corruption of `Cannibal' due to Adderley's huge appetite for food and habit of eating absolutely everything available at every opportunity, the result manifest in his generously proportioned, rotund and substantial physique. But boy, can he play that horn.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Truly, an incredible movie.  Who would have thought that an Italian would make one of the best American Westerns of all time, but Leone did.  Gorgeous visuals, haunting soundtrack, not a hero in the entire movie.  Great storytelling.  Not a false note in the entire picture.  Too slow?  Not at all.  No humor?  That's right, at least not overt Eastwood Western humor.  Beautiful.  You bet!  I've been waiting years for the Blu-Ray and here it (finally) comes.  Don't be mislead by negative reviews.  This is an experience not to be missed.
1401219268|4.0|** spoiler alert ** I have never read a comic book in my life and was quite surprised that a \\"graphic novel\\" is in fact a big comic book. The first time I approached this book I was immediately put off by the style and had trouble \\"getting into\\" the unusual font. The second time I picked up this book (I had run out of reading material) I was able to get into the story and I'm very happy that I stuck with it.<br /><br />I saw the movie but I don't remember much of it. The book hearkens back to the 80s in an alternative history where Nixon is still president because the United States won the Vietnam War. The world is on the brink of nuclear war and it seems the entire population is doomed...<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to fans of science fiction, alternative history, etc. It was a rewarding read.

0756404738|2.0|In my opinion, The Name of the Wind is one of the best epic fantasy books written in the last decade.  And like most, I waited with bated breath for his next book.  That said, I had high expectations for The Wise Man's Fear, and the first few hundred pages didn't let me down.  After that the book reads like a video game.  A lot of small adventures that lead to other small adventures, which always make Kvothe a stronger person in a very short amount of time.  There's really no rhyme or reason for why events happen in this book.  I won't spoil the book for you, but I felt like I was reading a script for a video game.  I only finished this book because I enjoyed his first one so much.  Very disappointing...
B003UESJ9M|4.0|I am not a country and western fan.  Have always felt the monotone twang, and 4 note limit-range octaves pretty dreary -- and to have lasted so long in America, at the expense of other previous music, is plain astonishing.  But if this is country, I'm ready to go with it.<br /><br />The film, if it has flaws, is that I really could have used about two more script pages of \\"explaining\\" what the heck is going on!  As it goes, we get only bits and pieces.  Not all the characters motives are clearly outlined or defined.  And that is where it could have been so much better.  Yet the unraveling slices we see, are a range of such depth and complexity, it sometimes/always keeps you wondering.  And wanting more.<br /><br />But for the characters in it, this has to be an all-round bravado set of performances.  Miss Paltrow, as sharp and crisp, as I've never seen her before; Tim McGraw an absolute presence of solid restraint, and final vulnerablity... with Garrett Hedlund stealing the show (with an ambiguous sort of character, you can't figure what drives him, or where he wants to go, or even why -- ), with a charm that is irresistable, and a voice (even McGraw has said) is wondrous. And let's not forget Leighton Meester, who can sing, and developes into a real darling... yet still doesn't hold the bottom of the basket together.<br /><br />With what we have, weaknesses and all, I give it 4 1/2 stars.  The range and scope of complexities presented,and carried through -- had it gone further, we might have hit a ten on this one.  The music and performances were terrific.  But some of you... like to grumble about anything.  Too bad you missed the real qualities of the whole.

1603425381|5.0|The edgings are terrific. I like that each edging has clear charts, written directions and a good picture. Sometimes it's hard to get a stitch figured out but it is much easier when you have all three things to help. There is a helpful section in the front of the book that gives detailed information about edgings. I found the part about how to determine how many stitches to make for an edging very helpful. The final section of the book has general crocchet punctuation and symbols, also helpful. Interspersed throughout the book are helpful tips. There are a few edgings I can't see myself using, but many, many more that I will. I do lots of knitting, and I think there may be a place for crocheted edgings on my knitting as opposed to picking up all the stitches on a whole afghan to do a knitted on border. I would love to take a class from this author.

1853267805|1.0|As I read this book I made notes where Darwin was unscientific:<br /><br />P.xiii: He says he had \\"little time\\" for aspects of Lamarck's work.<br />Perhaps this is why his research is inferior to that of Lamarck.<br /><br />P.4: \\"I cannot now give references and authorities for my several statements.\\"<br /><br />Why not? It is unreasonable to present information that the reader cannot verify by checking references.<br /><br />P.5: He refers to the \\"struggle for existence among all organic beings. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\\"<br /><br />Malthus's \\"Principles of Population\\" states that disease, accidents, war and famine \\"keep down the population of savage races to so much lower an average than that of more civilized peoples.\\" There is no scientific evidence to justify the application of Malthus's controversial exposition to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.<br /><br />\\"P.6: Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of less improved forms of life, and induces what I have called divergence of character.\\"<br /><br />He provides no examples to support this assertion, and does not define \\"less improved forms of life\\". Less improved? In what way?<br /><br />P.7: He states that the notion that \\"each species has been independently created is erroneous.\\"<br /><br />He provides no evidence to support this assertion.<br /><br />P.11: He states that there is \\"inherited development of udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked\\".<br /><br />So it seems Lamarck was right then.<br /><br />P.16: \\"I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species\\".<br /><br />But what did the wild species descend from?<br /><br />P.17: On the subject of dogs he states that \\"by crossing we can get only forms  in some degree intermediate between their parents ... We must admit the greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc. in the wild state.\\"<br /><br />It would appear that he is stumped at the presence of the domestic dog. As for the evolution of the domestic cat, Darwin is silent on the matter.<br /><br />P.51: \\"the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom\\".<br /><br />So, the doctrine of Malthus is not just applied, it is applied with manifold force. What does that mean? He doesn't say.<br /><br />P.51: \\"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\".<br /><br />What is he implying here? That people should be destroyed according to the principles of Malthus: disease, accidents, war and famine to keep the numbers down?<br /><br />P.51: \\"Several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from Europe\\".<br /><br />Is he saying that his Malthus theory only applies in cases where humans have wantonly introduced new species into a previously undisturbed area? It would appear so.<br /><br />P.54: \\"On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey\\".<br /><br />The fact that Africa was not overrun by elephants and rhinos would appear to invalidate his Malthus theory as applied to the animal and vegetable kingdom.<br /><br />P.62 \\"[T]he vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\".<br /><br />How can a wild animal be happy? He doesn't say. Is he referring to people and/or domestic cats and dogs? If people, then why should they multiply? Why not keep the population at a stable and sustainable number? Then, the dreaded principles of Malthus would not have to be invoked.<br /><br />P.66: \\"Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black.\\"<br /><br />No evidence is provided to substantiate this statement. In [[ASIN:4871878791 Spandau The Secret Diaries]], for the entry of Feb 19th, 1964, Albert Speer states that he \\"never thought much of the Darwinist theory of struggle and killing with which Hitler was obsessed\\". The implication of Darwin's statement is that white purity is something that has to be strictly enforced.<br /><br />P.71: \\"The tendency [for cats] to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited.\\"<br /><br />Is this evolution through acquired characteristics or natural selection?<br /><br />P.105: \\"I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse.\\"<br /><br />The kiwi of New Zealand is a flightless bird that thrived until Westerners imported rats to the island. Beasts of prey existed in New Zealand before the rat arrived. So it would seem that he is wrong in his belief.<br /><br />P.110: \\"[S]uch facts as that former species of the elephant and rhino were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances into play.\\"<br /><br />So, he's saying that a \\"very common flexibility of constitution\\" caused the extinction of the mammoth is he? What rubbish.<br /><br />P.134: \\"By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life in its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent\\".<br /><br />So, once species have become \\"modified\\", they exterminate the original parent. Sounds like something Communist regimes over history have practiced.<br /><br />P.136: \\"[I]ntermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods ... as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\\"<br /><br />By stating that intermediate forms \\"should be exterminated\\", Darwin appears to be advocating that people should be doing the exterminating. He provides no evidence as to why this should be the case.<br /><br />P.136: \\"[A]ny form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers\\".<br /><br />He neglects to say that man is the cause of extermination of species. Anyway, what about the extermination of the dinosaurs and mammoths?<br /><br />P.136: \\"Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.\\"<br /><br />He supplies no evidence for this. If I was a Communist then I would perhaps take inspiration from this, as it implies the triumph of \\"a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat\\".<br /><br />P.152: \\"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\\".<br /><br />He doesn't say who the \\"We\\" refers to. If he doesn't know what causes these variations, then perhaps he should abandon his theory.<br /><br />P.154: \\"If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\"<br /><br />In his book on ESP, T.C. Lethbridge refers to a parasitic beetle that is only found in wasps' nests. He says, \\"This kind of situation occurs everywhere in the world of insects, spiders and so on. Every parasite is adapted for its life role and some of these are very complicated. How did the liver-fluke think out an evolution whereby its first host is a small snail which is then eaten by a sheep? These things make no sense as explained by Darwinian evolution; but they are perfectly understandable, if you once postulate an external mind planning them.\\"<br /><br />P.154: \\"After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\"<br /><br />This does not account for sudden, mass extinctions.<br /><br />P.155: \\"The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe.\\"<br /><br />On page 62 he claimed that \\"the vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\". Therefore, is he stating that the European plants and animals are happier, healthier and more vigorous than the NZ species? H.G. Wells in [[ASIN:B0006D6PQE Mr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island,]] makes the following point: \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious. In nature a relative survival of the rotten and dying is possible.\\" So, as the kiwi bird is exterminated by the rat, this presumably the sort of evolution that Darwin has in mind in his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.<br /><br />P.157: \\"Natural selection in each well-stocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country.\\"<br /><br />Is he saying that perfection equals strength, or that either perfection or strength will be produced? If he is saying that strength and perfection are the same thing then this is Marxist ideology. As for the inhabitants of smaller countries yielding to those of larger ones, perhaps this is what provided some inspiration to the Nazi lebensraum program.<br /><br />P.158: He continues: \\"For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.\\"<br /><br />He provides no evidence for this statement. If something is perfect in nature, then it is perfect. Who is Darwin to judge on the standard of perfection in nature?<br /><br />On page 168 he discusses slave making ants. \\"If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected ... The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work.\\"<br /><br />Slave-making is described as a \\"wonderful\\" instinct. The workers are \\"courageous\\" in capturing slaves. It sounds like Darwin is a fan of slavery.<br /><br />P.169: \\"According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\\".<br /><br />How many ants nests have doors in them? Is Darwin extrapolating from ants nest findings theories about how human slaves should behave?<br /><br />P.171: \\"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.\\"<br /><br />Yes, Darwin is a fan of the \\"wonderful\\" instinct of making slaves.<br /><br />P.186: There is \\"one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\"<br /><br />Let the strongest live and the weakest die, he says. So, presumably, Darwin would be against all forms of pest control, because the rat is the strongest animal, so it should be allowed to live. I wonder if fans of eugenics were inspired by Darwin's one general law.<br /><br />P.214: \\"... all changes have been effected very slowly through natural selection.\\"<br /><br />All changes eh? Excluding humans, of course. Darwin offers no explanation for the rapid development/sudden appearance of modern man.<br /><br />P.229: \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\"<br /><br />Lloyd Pye, from [[ASIN:0966013433 Everything You Know Is Wrong: Human Origins]]: \\"600 million years ago soft-bodied corals and tiny worm-like creatures appear. All come suddenly and - like prokaryotes and eukaryotes - with no precursors.\\" It would appear that it is time to ditch Darwin's theory.<br /><br />P.235: \\"I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating to only two or three countries ... On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.\\"<br /><br />So, Darwin, instead of finding his flawed theory at fault, because it cannot be substantiated from geological records, instead puts the blame on Geology. Is this a case of sour grapes?<br /><br />P.242: \\"The theory of natural selection is grounded in the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\"<br /><br />That's rubbish. The mammoth was a superior animal to the elephant. Also, modern man walks in a less efficient manner than earlier forms of man.<br /><br />P.259: \\"But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.\\"<br /><br />He does not give specifics. When is it a very slow process? How about sudden extinctions?<br /><br />On page 269 he refers to \\"an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes, that 'every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species'<br /><br />But... that sounds like spontaneous acts of creation! If as if realising the implication, Darwin then starts rambling about modification during the process of descent from a single parent. The trouble with Darwin and his whole theory is that he cannot provide the evidence to back it up.<br /><br />He rambles on from mention of Mr Wallace's ingenious paper with a mention of English race horses. These \\"differ slightly from every other breed, but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\"<br /><br />So, they only proof that Darwin has to offer for evolution progressing by very slow changes is not proof at all.

Darwin equates perfection with power. As H.G. Wells says, \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious.\\" Such as man! In the glossary Darwin defines \\"parasite\\" as \\"an animal or plant living upon or in, and at the expense of another organism\\". Humans could legitimately be called parasites, and so it seems Darwin must be insanely optimistic if he thought that endless forms most beautiful are continuing to be evolved, when as he noted on page 51, \\"Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\". If Darwin was a realist, then he might have come to the same conclusion as H.G. Wells: \\"So that so far from Evolution being necessarily a strenuous upward progress to more life and yet more life, it might become a graceless drift towards a dead end.\\" He was more blunt in 1939, in his Fate of Homo Sapiens, referring to a \\"new barbarism\\" and predicting that \\"Mankind which began in a cave and behind a windbreak will end in the disease soaked ruins of a slum.\\" Considering, the evidence, Wells' outlook seems more likely than that of Darwin. In addition, Darwin it seems did not want to consider any evidence for sudden mass extinctions in the past.<br /><br />In the glossary, Darwin defines \\"retrogression\\" as \\"Backward development. When an animal, as it approaches maturity, becomes less perfectly organised than might be expected from its early stages and known relationships, it is said to undergo a retrograde development or metamorphosis.\\" This appears to have occurred in Darwin's case. This book is a candidate for the most overrated book in the history of publishing.n rendered higher.\\"    He provides no evidence for this statement. If something is perfect in nature, then it is perfect. Who is Darwin to judge on the standard of perfection in nature?     On page 168 he discusses slave making ants. \\"If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected ... The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work.\\"    Slave-making is described as a \\"wonderful\\" instinct. The workers are \\"courageous\\" in capturing slaves. It sounds like Darwin is a fan of slavery.    P.169: \\"According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\\".    How many ants nests have doors in them? Is Darwin extrapolating from ants nest findings theories about how human slaves should behave?    P.171: \\"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.\\"    Yes, Darwin is a fan of the \\"wonderful\\" instinct of making slaves.    P.186: There is \\"one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\"    Let the strongest live and the weakest die, he says. So, presumably, Darwin would be against all forms of pest control, because the rat is the strongest animal, so it should be allowed to live. I wonder if fans of eugenics were inspired by Darwin's one general law.    P.214: \\"... all changes have been effected very slowly through natural selection.\\"    All changes eh? Excluding humans, of course. Darwin offers no explanation for the rapid development/sudden appearance of modern man.    P.229: \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\"    Lloyd Pye, from [[ASIN:0966013433 Everything You Know Is Wrong: Human Origins]]: \\"600 million years ago soft-bodied corals and tiny worm-like creatures appear. All come suddenly and - like prokaryotes and eukaryotes - with no precursors.\\" It would appear that it is time to ditch Darwin's theory.    P.235: \\"I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating to only two or three countries ... On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.\\"    So, Darwin, instead of finding his flawed theory at fault, because it cannot be substantiated from geological records, instead puts the blame on Geology. Is this a case of sour grapes?    P.242: \\"The theory of natural selection is grounded in the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\"    That's rubbish. The mammoth was a superior animal to the elephant. Also, modern man walks in a less efficient manner than earlier forms of man.    P.259: \\"But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.\\"    He does not give specifics. When is it a very slow process? How about sudden extinctions?    On page 269 he refers to \\"an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes, that 'every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species'    But... that sounds like spontaneous acts of creation! If as if realising the implication, Darwin then starts rambling about modification during the process of descent from a single parent. The trouble with Darwin and his whole theory is that he cannot provide the evidence to back it up.     He rambles on from mention of Mr Wallace's ingenious paper with a mention of English race horses. These \\"differ slightly from every other breed, but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\"    So, they only proof that Darwin has to offer for evolution progressing by very slow changes is not proof at all. It is when humans interfere by breeding and improving the stock of race horses and cattle.     P.367: \\"The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record.\\"    Sour grapes because the evidence is lacking to support his theory.    P.368: \\"To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual.\\"    Darwin believes in God! No doubt the likes of Richard Dawkins would accuse him of being unscientific on this score.    P.369: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most excited object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows.

B000RIWAVW|3.0|This movie is flat out not scary any more.  Sure, for it's time, it was a scary movie.  It kept you on the edge of your seat. Not any more. I watched Halloween for the first time just now, and let me tell you, an \\"average\\" horror movie these days has more suspense than this one. I watched a movie called \\"They\\" not too long ago, a more recent movie, that had a heck of a lot more suspense than this movie, and most people have probably never heard of it nor did it get any accolades I'd bet, well, at least not compared to this one.  I'm sorry, seeing a TV screen cut off because the camera is looking through a mask with heavy breathing is not scary!<br /><br />In the day and age of Saw, The Ring, etc., this just doesn't have the shock value at all.  Sort of like \\"Rosemary's Baby.\\"  Well regarded for it's time, and the legacy continues to this day, but not scary by today's standards.
B004MGMJ3E|5.0|With just one review so far, I think we should get the ball rolling on Tomboy...    This is a very sucessful album.  As many reviews have mentioned, Tomboy is not necessarily a 'follow-up' album to Person Pitch.  The sound is simpler in a way that is hard to describe.  The melody, idea, hook, or whatever, behind each song is simpler but the mood of each song and the spacey atmospheric production makes simple sound BIG.  Listen at high volume.    The sound: not exactly organic as some reviews would have one think.  Imagine heavily processed guitar over a simple beat, with layer after layer of reverberating vocals.  The obvious reference might be the infamous 'wall of sound' but I really don't have another record that sounds like this one.    Tomboy has an interesting history because of the rather odd way in which it was slowly secreted by its creator.  Panda has toured these songs and released many in a rawer form as 7\\" singles.  This has given the listener the odd choice of having a choice.  The work of Sonic Boom on the LP version of these songs is certainly noticable.  If one word has been used as jornalistic shorthand to describe the music of Panda Bear and his legions, it is \\"nostalgic\\".  Sonic Boom knows this adjective; in fact, MGMT's Boom produced album Congratulations has beocme one of this reviewers go-to records due to this nostaligic touch that is heard in songs such as \\"I Found A Whistle\\" and \\"Siberian Breaks\\".  He was an excellent choice to mix these songs for the LP.  The synth line on Tomboy is one example of a welcome addition that his mixes have provided, as are the percussive additions to \\"Last Night at the Jetty\\" and \\"Slow Motion\\".      Surprises include the pulsing \\"Afterburner\\", the sole track that Panda is willing to stretch to any great length.  Also a welcome surprise is the download of the 9/11/10 show that Panda played at Governor's Island, NY - this bootleg was a wonderful audience recording made even more pristine with the mastering touchof Sonic Boom...BONUS!!    Drones, repetition, and ecccchoohooohooohooo.  These are good things.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I'm very disappointed in Lucas for not releasing his original Star Wars movies in BluRay.  I don't want a mucked up \\"improved version\\" of the originals.  Just give us the 'original theatrical' version, in bluray, with the least amount of changes to the original 'character' of the movies.  DO IT FOR YOUR FANS, George!
0375714839|5.0|Satrapi said she didn't want to write a text-only book on her subject because the Western world, the people who she felt needed to know her story, probably would not want to read fine prose about horrible events in Iran from 1970~1994.  Making this a graphic novel definitely works because the pictures not only provide entertainment but also show Satrapi's perspective on the world developing perspective as she aged.<br /><br />I read all 330+ pages in one sitting one evening.  It reads really quickly because there's very little text per page.  As long as you can take in the illustrations and get the idea pretty quickly, you're good to go.  Of course, I also want to recommend going slowly and really enjoying the illustrations.  I went over it a second time just to get a good feel for the artwork, and it was absolutely worth it.<br /><br />The film version of this book is pretty poor by my opinion.  There's potentially an entire movie about all the characters who were left out of the film but seemed almost essential in the book.  Also, facts were either changed or were left out so that the story appeared differently.  For example, instead of showing Satrapi struggling with antidepressants and then quitting, the film seemed to depict a scenario in which Satrapi just kept taking loads of antidepressants until she somehow got better.<br /><br />The book is really the Persepolis to experience.  I'm glad I bought it and read it, and I feel like I was really missing out on quite a bit of history before.  Buy it and enjoy it, and you'll eagerly learn a lot about Iran since Western imperialism again began twisting around its people.
B000006N01|5.0|I was so pleased to finally acquire this collectors edition of \\"It's Only Rock N Roll\\" by the Rolling Stones. Musically as a Stones album, it's not in the same league with \\"Exile On Main Street\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Beggars Banquet\\" and \\"Get Yer Ya Ya's Out\\", but it's in a very good grouping of the second tier Stone's albums.      Of all the Stones albums that were released as Collector's Edition's by the Virgin label many years ago, this was the one that was the most difficult for me to obtain in the last few years.  I was always out bid on Ebay for this one when it was available. If this one had been put up for bid, I probably wouldn't of ended up with a copy.  So, I got lucky, I was in the right place and right time on-line through Amazon.
B004V71CYQ|4.0|This is a landmark film in the world of Sci/Fi.  I have read the 2 other reviews and I think it's shameful that this movie has so few things written about it.  I will admit, it's not the most profound or well executed plot that I've ever seen in a movie.  But, this is a movie that was conceived of before internet was around.  There were no animation programs, there were no web-sites, and there was no touch-screen anything.  The fact that the producers made a movie about being sucked into a computerized world and having an adventure in a video game is impressive for the early 1980s (remember the old Apple IIGS?).  Anyway, this is an historic and landmark Sci/Fi movie that you should see just so you know the history of Sci/Fi.  As of now it looks grainy, old fashioned, and frankly out of date but it's worth it if you are a true fan of Sci/Fi.
B004L49K20|5.0|This album is pure excellence. The first time I listened to it I thought it was good but not great. Listening to it a second time will have you hooked. I can't stop listening to this!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Ever see the movie 'Hercules' with  Lou Ferigno?  And the scene where the special effects had a teddy bear spinning in the sky trying to depict the constellation Orion? Well, there are some special effects  that borderline on the comical in film. I had to bite my lips to keep from laughing at times during 'Black Swan'.   Final scene:  a  gaping, growing abdominal wound worsens on a ballerina with  a self mutilation psychosis as she moans something about being 'perfect now'.  Too much mirror had been  crammed into her abdomen by her own hand.  Dunno. That crater wound from a sliver coupled with the choreographer's asking in falsetto tone--and too calmly-- if she's alright.  Hmmm. The scene where her mother's paintings dance around is just plain funny as well.  I dislike this film for making me laugh at moments that were totally inappropriate:))    Second point, though a technical afterthought. Having gone to school with a doc who wanted to write,  I remember his  wanting to fit all of  Polti's plots into  a magnum opus. His first book.  Well if someone told me that this doc had written 'Black Swan', I'd believe them.   Self mutilation,  a body dysmorphic diagnosis and a doppelganger or  an ego dissociation thing hit the fan in this film.  And the attempts to blend this all together into a cohesive piece of art was, not entirely, but in part, a chuckle producer.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Old school but excellent.  Does exceed the original Star Trek.  Accurately predicts major issues we face in the 21 Century here in the US.  I won't equate it to Obama Care, but it does suggest concern about our society's commitment to our senior population.

No pun intended ;) I have fallen in love with the Characters and with every turn of the page, I found myself rooting for them. The entire series was very well written, and I encourage one and all (maybe the 17 and over crowd) to read this facinating book.
0316017922|4.0|This book questions the common belief that success is entirely individual. Anyone who has wondered what makes a person successful or has felt intimidated by the seemingly self-made nature of outliers would enjoy this book.     To discover the truth about success, Gladwell looks at a combination of opportunity and upbringing. His examples include well-known figures such as Bill Gates and Mozart. He also looks at intelligence, the historical period in which a person is born, and even what month a person is born in.     He also claims that outliers, regardless of the level of their natural talent, average about 10,000 hours of practice/work in their field (often by the age of twenty). This number may seem discouraging but it points out the reason that some people, even with the right opportunities and upbringing, still don't succeed. An aspect of being an outlier is the willingness to practice and take advantage of opportunities. Although there is more to success than individual work, it is still a necessary part of the equation.     Gladwell complicates our view of success by presenting a multi-faceted argument that is both compelling and entertaining. That being said, I felt that the obscure chapter titles made it hard to figure out where he was going with the information he presented. Also, Gladwell fails to discuss those who fall outside of his claims. There were other computer geniuses in the 70s that were not born between 1953 and 1956 (like Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, and Steve Jobs were). Steve Wozniak was born in 1950. Would this be considered too early to be successful in the age of the personal computer or acceptable as it is within three years of his other examples? The way he presents the dates makes them seem more concrete than a mere approximation. Some sort of mention about outliers that don't readily fit his formulas would have been beneficial and increased Gladwell's credibility.
0439023513|5.0|I read this book in less than 24 hours. I couldn't put it down! I was very pleased with how the author ended the book and the series for that matter. You will no be dissapointed. I most definitly was not!
0316098337|5.0|An absolutely unique book, with a few flaws that didn't deter me from giving this five stars. What some reviewers have seen as its strong point, I saw as a flaw. It is written in a kind of baby talk from the point of view of a 5 yr old boy locked in a room with his mother, which I found annoying at first, and at the end still did not understand. Why would a boy whose mother talks to him normally still talk in baby talk at 5? It didn't make sense. However, it did portray the uneven development of this boy.    What I thought was strongest, again unlike many reviewers, was the language and interactions once the boy and his mother went out into the 'real'world. It is a devastating but compassionate critique of our social and psychological world,and of the way we relate in this modern world.     So I say, read on if you find this annoying at first. It is well worth it!
0670022411|5.0|I admit it - this is the type of book I really like.  I have worked my way through Charlaine Harris' books and really enjoyed them, but this book is different - the story is well developed, the characters are intersting and you feel like you really know them and I was really sad to get to the end; in fact I seriously considered starting it over the next day!  One concern - and it is minor - it seemed like the author might have rushed the end just a bit.  But what do I know?  I've never written a book - I'm just a plain old reader. The other - funnier thing was I didn't notice it was written to be a triology and I was so disappointed at the end.  I didn't want it to be finished and thought it was perfect for a sequal - then I saw the tiny print that it was the first of three books - thank goodness (and silly me)!  Bottom line -Harkness took a well used topic and applied a really ingenious twist on the relationship of humans and \\"the other beings in the world\\" - applying some very interesting historical information making for a really great read - there is a bit of magic in this one. Enjoy
0756405890|5.0|I was just on my kindle browsing fiction when I saw this book pop up. I read the summary and I thought all right this will do, When I started reading the book it was a little uninteresting in the beginning but then the author started to weave a story. I was unable to put down my kindle as I was slowly being sucked into the story. This book has no major flaws in it and not one part that I disagreed with. I would recommend this book to people who are looking for adventure and witty tales.
B001P829VY|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest films of all time.<br />Human greed and what it does to people. Still has a good lesson about what folks will become when profit is involved.<br />A solid cast, Walter Huston is great as the old Prospector, Howard.<br />Bogey's line \\"see, mug\\" I love it. Plus the famous \\"badges\\" line by Alphonso Bedoya, \\"The Gold Hat\\"<br /><br />As many times as I had seen this film, I never really bothered considering what had happened to Dobb's at the end. Watch the Gold Hat as his eyes follow and then a plop in the water. Although Huston was forced to remove the scene in it's entirety, very grisly when you think about it.<br />A few cameos by the Director John Huston, even one by Tony Baretta himself, Robert Blake.<br /><br />This blu-ray was impressive, being this movie is quite old. The picture is a bit grainy here and there, but overall a great picture.<br /><br />The music soundtrack is also great.<br /><br />This is one to buy!
0385341008|4.0|This is a pretty good book, and like my title indicates, you won't feel like you are wasting any time as you read it. The author does a good job helping us get to know many of the characters despite that it is written in letter format--not an easy task. It is a good book to read at a leisurely place, much like you'd read real letters filled with news, personal narrative and humor. Lovers of historical fiction, notably, post WWII Europe will enjoy it.
0316069353|1.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite writers. But this latest addition to his Mickey Haller \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" series was tedius and boring. He spent a lot of time on legal criminal procedure and little time on character development. I found my self clicking to the next page on my kindle hoping this story would develop into more than a newspaper article. Even his more colorful characters seemed to be suffering from ennui and disinterest, just like I was!
140004281X|1.0|This book was recommended at my book club, but it wasn't for me. Granted I do not really like short story collections--although I had more success with a previous book of short stories picked for my book club. I tried jumping around this book to find something I liked, but it didn't work. The lead characters seemed somewhat interchangable, and I had trouble telling one story that I had begun and not finished from another one that I couldnt stick with. I couldn't stick with a story for more than 2-3 pages. But, that's just me. Give me a novel, or better yet, some non-fiction book of interest any day. Better luck to other readers.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero immediately sinks into action that will remind readers of the Percy Jackson series.  Riordan does a fantastic job of making Greek Mythology fun to learn and reader young and old will be hard pressed to put the book down. If you read his previous works you enjoy putting that information to use while reading these latest adventures with a new cast of characters. Old favorites show up and make this book work by giving the readers just enough of the Percy Jackson series without making the story feel redundant. As always, the cliffhanger at the end will make anyone anxious to read the sequel and hope that it comes sooner rather than later!

B0042U94UQ|4.0|With many kid's films, there is a fine line between being funny and being completely stupid. Despicable Me has enough silliness to create laughs, but is heartwarming enough with its ultimate message and moral : even the most villainous of villians can change. Sure, stealing the moon is a little bit of a silly premise, but , hey, it's a kid's movie, right? Steve Carrell is the voice of Gru,  an animated Dr. Evil type (minus the adult humor) known for stealing things. Gru, not on the top of his game, comes up with the idea of stealing the moon to maintain his status as supervillian numero uno. He needs help and sees the adoption of three girls as a means of achieving his plan. However, as you can imagine, he finds out that caring for three children is quite a chore, and, as much as his is a villain, he can't help but eventually feeling compassion for the kids. Still, a villain is a villain, and Gru has his plan to pass supernerd villain Vector, so what can possibly get in the way? Possibly three little girls?     The \\"change of heart\\" story certainly is rehashed material, but Despicable Me is a feel-good film with some very funny moments and plenty of visual effects and entertainment, especially with Gru's \\"cousins\\" ,the hilarious minions, getting into all sorts of trouble. The extras are also fun, something that the kids will enjoy.     Despicable Me is really not that despicable.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This film's target audience is leagues beyond just the Civil War fan. \\"The Conspirator\\" draws the viewer into a period of time and forces a decision between emotions likely felt by North & South Americans of the era. Robert Redford (director/producer) takes a side-note of Lincoln and Civil War history and catapults it into a very believable, re-living, docu-drama-like, story that will touch you at a human and political level. Some viewers will despise the end, others cheer, but oddly, both sides will consider it justice. But was it?<br /><br />Looking at historical accounts, one can find the story buried in the lesser known details of the War's end and a Presidential assassination. Mary Surratt (Robin Wright-`Forrest Gump') is arrested with other men and accused of a murder conspiracy. A planned attack on 3 political leaders. One, Lincoln, would die, and one woman, Mary, would be pushed toward justice at a vengeance speed. No trial by peers, but a tribunal justice, with the deck stacked hugely against innocence. Even her lawyer, Frederick Aiken (James McAvoy-`Atonement' `Narnia') ex-Union fighter was chosen to hasten a guilty verdict and quick hanging. He is reluctant to defend and believes her guilty. The attorney role causes romantic troubles for Aiken, but that is a minor bit of the story. The relationship between Aiken and his client, as well as political/military figures including commission head Gen. Hunter (Colm Meeney) and War Secretary Stanton (Kevin Kline) is the basis for the masterfully written story.<br /><br />This should win awards, perhaps not as individual acting moments, but overall, and on the top of the deserving list is screenplay writer James Solomon. The writing IS the story. A documentary written in dramatic dialogue. The director has brought the written masterpiece alive. The visual effects are a constant 1860s view as through tintype photographs or panoramic daguerreotypes of the era but with subtle color. That is just another stellar decision that gives this film such period authenticity and charm. It reminded me of a stage show once attended of \\"Scrooge\\" with the entire theater in a light London-like fog. Both were historically invigorating to the senses. \\"The Conspirator\\" is a towering achievement and quite appropriate in the opening days of the Civil War's Sesquicentennial. Let's hope this spurs more films related to this era, and proves that all do NOT need to be feature-length battle scenes. This is a very fast and emotional two hours of viewing.<br /><br />Painstaking detail to costuming and sets are also to be regarded. In the scene of the hanging (not all tried were lynched) there is obvious consideration to actual photographs taken in 1865. This is a dramatic portrayal, but will also be considered by some to be as close to a documentary as one can get with this historic material. Top hat's off to director Redford and writer Solomon.<br /><br />I was so excited about reading the preliminary accounts of this movie that I attended the second showing on opening day. It was worth the theater price, and I WILL be buying the DVD when available. See it. It's brings back Kennedy assassination memories, and yet hits true to today's politics as well. Dare I add this is educational? PG-13 and students SHOULD see this for U.S. history and civics content.his film such period authenticity and charm.

B00003CXDD|5.0|Friday night is \\"MPMN - Mom picks the Movie Night\\" - this was an attempt on my part to show my kids that movies are just as good, if not better, without 3d. I loved this when I was younger so I decided to buy it for this week's MPMN. I was excited then worried, would it be too dark? Too scary? or too much for my 6,7, and 9yr olds.   Within seconds of it starting there was dead silence in the living room, something rarely seen here. They even made me pause it while the dogs were barking so they didn't miss anything. When it ended I looked at my 9yr old, who usually complains that every movie has someone falling in love, he was smiling from ear to ear and said \\"OK you know how to pick a movie\\", the 6yr old said \\"it was scary but it ended perfect\\" and the 7yr old, who complains about everything, couldn't stop talking about it.   I told my mom what we watched so she is on her way over to borrow it:-)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is great, and even that is an understatement. I bought this backpack as one of my fiances anniversary gift since he's been needing something new to carry all of his camera equipment in. I was debating between this one and a Canon one that was a similiar price. With this one, it doesn't scream \\"Hey! There's a camera inside!\\" which is good. The backpack looks little, but there is SO much room on the inside! And there are many little compartments as well. It's great. Looks like we're going to have to order more accessories to fill it up!
0956251579|5.0|I literally could not put this book down once I got started. The writing is crisp, clear, and intelligent. The characters are vivid and sympathetic. Even the villain is human,not a cardboard cutout. Tension crackles on every page.     Definitely recommended, although not if you're alone at night in a creaky house.
0062060554|4.0|Christine Lucas is living one of my worst nightmares.  She wakes up every morning with no clue where she is, who the man is that's lying in bed beside of her, and thinking she's at least twenty years younger.  Every morning her husband has to wake up to find her in a panic and explain her life to her.  She remembers what he tells her until she goes to sleep and then she forgets everything once again.  She begins secretly seeing a doctor that has her start keeping a journal.  He calls her each day and tells her who he is and where to find the journal.  Once she starts reading what she's written down each day, she finds things aren't quite what they should be.    This book had me hook, line, and sinker from the very beginning.  The premise was so different from anything I've read before, especially in the thriller genre.  Once I would start reading, I found it hard to stop.  I couldn't wait to find out what had caused Christine's amnesia and whether or not she would remember.  I couldn't wait to find out who was telling her the truth and who was lying to her.  This was just one of those books that you can't put down until you have all the answers!  Some parts were repetitive as I've seen other reviewers comment on, but to me it seemed necessary to the story.  She does have amnesia after all, so of course each day you're going to have to hear about her waking up in a panic and asking her husband questions.  This was an excellent debut novel and I can't wait to see what the future holds for this author.
B0042KZJ46|5.0|This double CD is definitely worth the wait and very enjoyable for a new Bob Marley fan.  I enjoyed hearing a few of the hits off of Legend but more than those I enjoyed hearing different songs previously not heard by me.  The recordings are good quality and overall a very enjoyable experience.  I would definitely recommend.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is a great set for any lost fan!  I only wish the Blu Ray was in an actual case, but for everything you get, it is well worth it!  Lost is even better in Blu!
0670022411|5.0|I read this book on Kindle.  I really didn't care for the first 18%.  Just when you think you were getting somewhere with the plot you'd take a few steps back.  Way too much unnecessary detail.  After that the book took off and I couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended.
1857885082|5.0|In Watching the English, social anthropologist Kate Fox takes a look at her own tribe with a view to coming up with a \\"grammar of Englishness.\\" She watches the English quite literally, observing how they behave when in line at a coffee shop or on a train or while using a cellphone, eavesdropping on their conversations, performing experiments or testing hypotheses on unwitting strangers when she's out in public. Sometimes she'll even outright interview them:<br /><br />\\"A researcher with a notebook is a nuisance, of course, but much less scary than a random stranger trying to start a conversation for no apparent reason. If you simply start chatting to English people on trains or buses, they tend to assume you are either drunk, drugged or deranged. Social scientists are not universally liked or appreciated, but we are still marginally more acceptable than alcoholics and escaped lunatics.\\"<br /><br />Watching the English is absolutely fascinating and sometimes very funny. The author's writing is lively and lucid, but beyond her intentional humor there is humor inherent simply in taking a (relatively) detached look at behavior which most of the time we take for granted. (Just so, comedians like Jerry Seinfeld make us notice the humor in our everyday behavior.)<br /><br />Fox neatly ties up her findings in the end with a diagram showing the ten English characteristics she's tracked throughout the book: at the core of it all is social dis-ease, but other characteristics include humor (i.e., humour), class consciousness, \\"Eeyorishness\\" (that is, a tendency to moan about things), and modesty. In sum, I loved the book, and I love the English, with whom--it seems clear to me now--I have much in common.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B000A2W1X2|5.0|This amazing film grabs you immediately and never lets go. The passion, the love, the struggles and the hope just keep coming. Being a bachelor and nobody to answer to except my friend the cat, I often turn the film on as soon as I go to bed, and sleep to the haunting musical score.   Sophie Marceau is not only the world's most seductive woman, she engrosses you throughout with her amazing portrayal of an estranged mother who's lost her child. Stephen Dillane is perfect for the aristocratic lover/sperm donor. Unlike Scorsese's Age of Innocense, I can never get enough of this one. Marceau and Dillane equal every fiber of Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer. A true love classic.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|This CD has just blown me away!!!  It just keeps getting better everytime i listen to it.  \\"Rope\\" is great but there are so many other songs on this disc that are just so classic.  If you listen to the song \\"Walk\\" or \\"Back and Forth\\" or \\"Arlandria\\" and they do not move you, then im not sure you will like any rock song or album for that matter.  This is the best Rock album in years!  I own every Foo's Album, and this CD just might put the foo fighters up there with bands like Led Zeppelin, Areosmith, etc.  And thats no exaggeration.  They just keep getting better.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes online when it was first airing, and it was alright, but I fell out of it mostly because I couldn't catch it when it was on live and it was just a hassle to watch it on their site for whatever reason.<br /><br />I regret not keeping up with it.<br /><br />I noticed a coworker reading the books, so I ended up borrowing and being hooked, forcing my brother and guy friend to read them.  We rented these off Netflix and watched together, and let me TELL YOU, once you get to episode 5 you JUST CAN'T STOP!!! And for the record we are a female and two guys in our early to late 20s, so it isn't just for female teens!<br /><br />This show has likeable characters with real reactions and wonderful personalities (Damon, anyone??).  The vampires are awesome.  The cast is great! If anyone is familiar with Alias or Heroes, you will be so happy when David Anders appears midway into the season (he's got a Sark type personality from what I remember of him).<br /><br />This series goes in a completely different direction than the books, changes backgrounds, adds new characters, combines characters, but the way it's done actually doesn't make me wish they'd stick to the books more at ALL (like how True Blood makes me feel at times, but that's another story...and series ;) ).  I have my preferences in both the books and the series, but I'm able to see them as separate stories and love them both.<br /><br />Let me tell you, if the finale of this season doesn't get ya, I don't know what will.  One of the most satisfying and exciting ones I've seen in a long time, with of course a crazy cliffhanger to make you want another season.  And since I jumped on the Vamp Diaries bus a little late I have to wait until season 2 is done airing before I can start it!<br /><br />So what are you doing? Order this now! And for $20 for an entire season it's a STEAL!!!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|First of all, I loved the movie.  It's wonderfully told and imagined and a great build up for the final film. Definitely worth buying!    I am,however, disappointed with the quality of the film transfer to DVD. It has possibly some of the most pixelated images I have ever seen in a DVD. This is especially evident when the scenes are dark, which is most of the movie.   I'm not sure why this is so bad on the DVD compared to other films of similar darkness and length....but I think they should have put more focus into clearing it up some.     Otherwise, I love it....just wish it has the opening scene from part 2 as the bluray version does.
0375831002|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. After about 2 pages, I was sucked in and intrigued due to the interesting concept of telling a story from Death's perspective. While the writing format does take some getting used to(with the bold interruptions from the narrator), I loved the author's use of language. Yes, I enjoy figurative \\"fluff\\" as some have called it. I, however, do not see it as fluff, but a way to draw the reader in, distinctly imagining the world the author built. I also enjoyed the author's use of characterization, as each character grows and changes throughout the novel. I knew and loved the characters, all the way up to the bittersweet conclusion. I urge you to give this book a chance if you want to see an alternate perspective of Nazi Germany and its inhabitants. From 4th grade on, we are taught that Germans were the enemy, though as portrayed in this novel, not all Germans were against us and the Jews.
031603438X|4.0|I liked the look into the background of each of the Stones and the band. I found it fascinating how they came up with some of the songs and their titles. The only thing that kind of turned me off, and made it a four-star, not a five-star for me was Richards' drug use dominated so much of the book. I would have liked to find out more about what was happening with the band professionally these days, rather than where Richards was getting his next fix or his latest entanglement with the police.
B0006HBZXS|1.0|The only redeaming quality of this movie is knowing that it will eventually end.  I guess if you count the dialog, which ends up being quite funny, you've got an average bad movie.  I dig the bear, but I can't help but think of the conversation between Hopkins and Baldwin before the filming of the movie that probably ended with a, \\"you want to go to Alaska for free and stay at a lodge with Elle MacPhearson and get paid?\\"  Just a bad movie, pure and simple.  Good scenery shots, but that's not hard.  Down two thumbs.
B00005JKHP|5.0|All told I have always felt that this was the best Star Trek movie ever since it's theatrical release in 1979.  When I saw the director's cut, I thought that this was even better than the original version. Many of the external scenes (minus actors) were re-shot utilizing 1978 technology and were a vast improvement on the original scenes (which were okay as well). Scenes left out of the 1979 version were re-edited in also.  It was a terrible shame that this was never re-released into the theatres in 2004 on the 25th anniversary of the film's original release.
B0041YI4ZO|5.0|I can assure you that this is not a \\"bootleg\\" nor a cheaply made motion picture. You are kidding yourself if you believe that Sammo Hung Kam-bo is going to appear in anything less than a Grade A movie. Just like any great American actor, why would he? Ip Chun, the real-life eldest son of Ip Man appears in the movie as one of historical sifus his father trained under. The story line is set before the Ip Man story line and deals with a young Ip Man (Yu Hang-To, who looks just like a young Donnie Yen) learning Wing Chun from three different sifu. The special effects and martial arts scenes are entriguing, but remember this is a historical piece about a real master of a real art, not fantasy martial arts. So if you are looking for people soaring through trees and fighting on water, best to rent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The sets are beautiful and if you are a lover of all things Chinese you will be entralled with the very essence of this movie. I saw it in Cantonese with no sub-titles and then with English subs. Even without the subs the gist of the story was easy to follow. Ip Man is critical to the martial arts explosion of the seventies as his lessons shaped Bruce Lee's vision of martial arts, his own system, Jeet Kune Do, and ultimately his ability to capture the world's attention. Wing Chun caused Bruce to set aside the \\"classical mess\\" with all the fancy stances and dance-like formalities and adopt a more economical, decisive fighting method. This is why at the end of Ip Man 2 there is a clear nod to Bruce Lee. May you all be well, and enjoy life.
031261246X|5.0|Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst with his own computer business now, is hired by a law firm in New York to help them recover their computer systems after a virus caused them to crash. At the same time, his former colleague, Daryl, who still works for the government, is working on a computer glitch at a nearby hospital that resulted in several patient deaths. Then they start hearing about other computer issues ~ in airplanes, oil tankers, nuclear power plants and assembly lines around the world. Could it be the same virus attacking all of these computers? Jeff and Daryl team up to figure out what is really going on, and to find a solution before it's too late.<br /><br />In Zero Day, Mark Russinovich weaves a frightening story that seems all too real. Computers run our lives. We rely on them for so many things ~ I hadn't even thought of how they are used in planes and ships and power plants. Computers are used to run just about everything. And the idea of a large-scale terrorist attack on computer systems definitely makes for a thrilling novel. But the fact that author Russinovich is a leading expert on cyber-security and a Technical Fellow at Microsoft makes this novel even more believable ~ and troubling. I admit I didn't understand all of the technical details that Jeff and Daryl work through in the story, but given who the author is, I'm sure they are accurate.<br /><br />While there is a lot of focus on the characters working through the computer viruses, Zero Day has plenty of action too. We see the situation from the terrorists' eyes as they plan their attack and eliminate any obstacles in their way. And Jeff and Daryl, who are definitely not spies, find themselves in the line of fire as they try to find the source of the virus. The characters are all quite interesting, including the terrorists and the hackers who have helped them along the way. This is a fast-paced thriller that will make you look at the world a little differently when it ends.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for something to take the place of my local gym and all it had to offer.  I absolutely love this video.  It is very challenging, but I keep coming back for more.  I have not lost 20 lbs as it hypes, but have lost several pounds and am feeling stronger than I have in a long time.  This was my first Jillian Michaels video, and I have since ordered a few more to mix up my routine a bit. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a challenge.
