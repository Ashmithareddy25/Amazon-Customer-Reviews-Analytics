B009JZSC9S|5.0|I liked it a lot. It was better then the other seasons because it got away from the cheating and it is moving forward into other areas.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There could be a better search function, but it is well adapted for a smaller screen and it does the job
0385349947|1.0|A book written by a woman of privilege for women of privilege. Not at all interesting and difficult to get through.
B00F4KGJRO|4.0|Alan's rich vocals are outstanding as usual on this first complete bluegrass album. Excellent accompanying musicians make this a joy to listen to.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Both seasons 1 and 2 were fabulous.  Can't wait for season 3 to be ready for viewing. Five stars, for sure!
B00594XOZU|3.0|I've used kik on my kindle since i got it but just last night it logged me out without me doing anything and now it wont let me back in. It keeps telling me that its taking longer than it should and i should try again later. I love the app but i cant use it now and id like the problem fixed.
B002SAS26E|5.0|This game is simply to learn and teach, gameplay could be short (especially if you don't have much time to play something lengthy, and the artwork is nice. Quality of the components is great. Great for families as well. It's just a nice game. There are times when you want to play a game that is fun and doesn't required a lot of &#34;thinking&#34;, well this is it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent summary for somebody who never saw this saga before. It is the best way to sit down and do not stand up to the end
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great writing, great female characters and really good actors.<br /><br />For better or worse the premise of this show continues to remain a current topic of conversation. Its interesting to see these political marraiges after the hoopla dies down. I like the way they write the charachter of Alicia Florrick and all of the other characters around her. David Lee - he kills me.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Just excellent blues singing & guitar mastery. Great combination of players: Stephen Stills, Barry Goldberg, Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Check it out! I've been listening to it in rotation since I downloaded it. :)
B004G6009U|3.0|I was expecting it to have the wedding scene at the end where max sneezes and the rings roll away and he has to chase them to bring them back to the wedding ceremony.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was the first fictional book I've enjoyed in a long time.  Characters' emotions are grounded in reality making it easy to connect with each one.
B009PLKCEE|5.0|I always liked vlc for my pc. And when I started searching a video player app, first name came to my mind was VLC only. And i would say developers have done great job. I played videos for hours though only avi formats but they worked flawless. I would recommend this app to everyone who wants to utilize their kindle fires for video. I have rated it 5 stars because of its looks, functions(specially fit to screen ones) and ease of installing and using. It fits best to my needs and thats all for me to rate it so. Hope you all enjoy it too :)
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|THis is so much easier than learning from a book!! No need to spend hundreds of dollars on a language system.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This series is interesting enough that I don't dread my workouts. I stream in via iPad, using earbuds. I'm binge watching all the seasons and am now on season 3.
B009G41CG2|4.0|Fun Game for<br />easy to play music does get on ones nerves we turn it off most<br />of the time
B003EYVXSW|3.0|SPLICE  is a superior if predictable creature feature. The script is pretty good, the acting is pretty good, the effects are pretty good, and the directing is pretty good. It's sort of all-round pretty good really. What it's not is remarkable in any way. I did find some of the characters' behaviour unconvincing but otherwise it's a plausible take on genetic engineering gone haywire. It's not particularly memorable but it's good enough to be worth watching.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book depicts a fantasy Wonderland. This book is so awesome. I recommend it to fictional lovers. Rick Riordan rules
B0028RXXFC|5.0|And so God made man/woman, and with them, sex, violence, passions, reason and insanity.<br /><br />There is much to learn from this series, in my view, about all the above and what love is, and what it is not.<br /><br />If you can make it through all the pornographic material, if you can avoid losing the valuable things this series has the potential to teach the observer of it, then it may help you come away a more enlightened individual.<br /><br />There is some magnificent acting and directing achieved in this series and I believe, at some point, it is wasted on the excess of explicit sexual display -we get the point of decadence already.<br /><br />Or do we? Because to me, the salient sense of point I came away with from this series was just that -excess and decadence when indulged in by human beings reduces, often to zero, their capacity for love -I mean, the real thing, not lust. It is a fascinating thing to recognize that the Christ was about to be revealed to all Rome next up in its history. Why did that Person who claimed that God is love appeal to so many Romans in the eventuality of time?<br /><br />Perhaps because so much sex and violence drains all feeling from the human soul at some limit of its endurance, and it begins once again to long for the things of life, the feelings, the sensations, the spiritual awakenings that lift one past one's mere physical body and passions to seek a higher and deeper satisfaction and exaltation than mere physicality can ever produce.<br /><br />Maybe that's what He came to show us, that lust for killing, for power, for any lie or cruelty that will obtain that for us, that sense of being our own little god, is delusional and an existential loser.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I had to keep reading for the story to unfold. You are carried through the story at a good pace. Really enjoyed this!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|this is the perfect pacifier holder ever designed, I was recommend them for any parent of a newborn to buy and use them. cute too
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Strange movie, I don't know why I liked it but I did... I suppose reading whatever it was based on might button up some of the background and such.<br /><br />But it was a decent movie from an entertainment point of view... but seriously did anyone think the woman they reported to was real?<br /><br />Hey any chance to see Olga Kurylenko, loved her since Hitman, is worth the risk!
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|I was ready to give my tablet away because of the ads that popped up on everything (email, news, you name it). I've had Adblock and Adblock plus on my computers for years because they work! Finally went searching in the Ap Stores and found it (a beloved old friend that I didn't know had an Android cousin). Believe me, this worked too. No more ads. The only problem it created was that it blocked cookies for signing in on one of my email accounts. No big deal because I can access it a different way. To be rid of all those darned ads is a much bigger deal than one little glitch. I'm no technical nerd so I have no idea why some users had or have problems. What I do know is that it made my tablet (Nextbook with Android 4.something) a pleasure to use.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I don't usually like having previous stories re-hashed in prequels or sequels or alternate timelines etc... Star Trek seems to do this more than most...<br /><br />That said, I do like the new time line, I think it gives them the opportunity to do so new and exciting stories.  Now that the ground has been set, maybe the next movie can be something new?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Very good acting. The story is true to the Chicago political lifestyle. Any thing for money or power. It shows the struggle to do the right thing against the desire to succeed. It is a shame that they are in such an  amoral world and makes one glad it's not HIS world.
B008JFUO72|3.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but it's become a warning sign when ads are just plastered all over the TV about how great a movie is.<br /><br />I don't have anything in particular that I disliked, but overall it was a bit of a let down.  Perhaps the malfunctioning suits etc was a bit over done... and maybe that was echoing T Stark's mental malfunctions...<br /><br />I was glad to see the surgery at the end to remove the reactor from his chest (and that disgusting goop from the 2nd movie)... I would hope if there is another that it goes in a bit of a different direction...
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Another Star Trek movie. Not a bad movie, not a great movie. Typical Star Trek story, It isn't the best nor the worst film.  TOM
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|I've said it many times, as a general fan of most things Star Trek, I really did enjoy Enterprise.  It's unfortunate that the stories were a bit weak the first season...  I think a lot of folks were frustrated because this was &#34;not the Star Trek&#34; they remember... and lost patience.  But I enjoyed it, so I suppose there is one person who likes this review... :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun, relaxing game. It's hard to stop once you get started. You can only go so far for free, but to open all levels wasn't expensive, and I feel well worth the price to be able to continue playing.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|The stargate series were all good, this one in particular had a great cast/chemistry.  Sad to see it end, but at least the ending was decent, unlike so many shows that end before they should have.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|Item arrived factory sealed and brand new. Dvd plays just fine and this movie is soooooooooo weird LOL, but good!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Wow! This book was one of my all time favorites. I really loved it. I can't recommend enough for people to read this book.<br /><br />Added bonus - it's really long! So for those who devour books like me - squee!
B009WUBERW|3.0|More of the same, this franchise needs to go away. We found it extremely loud, monotonous and tiresome. Suitable for preteen boys only.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|So, this book got a lot of flack. I read the reviews after reading book 1, and postponed buying book 2, because you guys gave it poor reviews.<br /><br />What the heck people? This book was wonderful! A perfect follow up - I can not wait until I read the 3rd!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works very easily - I'm anxiously awaiting other programs.  Netflix and UTube are really fun, especially the classical music.I use the extension because it's easier.  I can't believe this only cost $35!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Unusual writing, however, I felt is was well written and it kept my interest.  Wasn't sure that I liked the ending although I could appreciate it.  Definitely worth reading.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I tried to log in but the stupid app  was saying this is taking longer than it should try again in a bit and I am so mad because my friend goes to kik and I don't have a phone so how should I text her!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Never mind the naysayers, this Z flic is stupendous; intelligent, gripping, even touching in certain parts. One senses a certain fatigue with the Undead trope- movies dating back to the 60s and a popular TV series. Granted, World War Z doesn't follow the book. It's reported there were deleted scenes and (apparently) numerous rewrites during production but the final product stands on its own and merits a sequel.<br /><br />Pitt contributes a solid performance minus most of the customary superhero excesses and Daniella Kertesz, as the wounded Israeli soldier, scores as a courageous yet heartbreakingly vulnerable sidekick.<br /><br />There's little gore and the CGI effects and set pieces, for example the scenes within the walled off city of Jerusalem, stun the senses. The Zombies inspire genuine fright. Unlike the shuffling ghouls in Walking Dead, for example, these guys go for your throat sprinting.<br /><br />I read Brook's novel and appreciated the sophisticated geopolitical take. But, let's be honest, consisting essentially of vignettes and post facto interviews with survivors of Z encounters renders the book less than ideal as a candidate for big screen treatment.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|I'm willing to check off stars, but not willing to yammer on about the movie. If that's not good enough for you people at Amazon, stop asking me.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I have been a Dylan fan for many years... This is a great 2 CD set.  Great recordings! One of the best Bootleg Series releases.
B001RPD06I|5.0|WORKS GREAT!! =D it has allowed me to transfer my College work from pc to laptop. Especially grateful for the transfer ease & security of my wedding photos. TYVM
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used Arctic Silver 5 for all my Processor/Heat Sink installs. I have not used anything else for such a long time that I have nothing to compare it to. I guess that says that I am a satisfied customer & have not had to look elsewhere for an alternative.
B008PZZYB2|4.0|Not a funny as I though it would be. With the people in the cast I was expecting more in the comedy lines.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I loved this book I recommend it to every one who is not easily saddened<br />This book is the best I have read I in a long time
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I just purchased this, but I really like it already.  I like the movements on the screen, along with the pictures of everything else.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Mind boggling room puzzles. Very interactive.  Using numbers-shapes and colors was great. How about using food or candies or people?
B00ADS98FC|5.0|From start to finish this movie is hilarious and entertaining.  Definitely recommended if you're looking for a light, musical comedy.  Loved it!
B004PGO25O|2.0|How is it this book part of kindle free lending library and each time I download it, Amazon zings out a 10.00 bill?  You do the work!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Perfect for me!  If only the surface could before like the paper whites i could read at beach!  Free to boot!
B008NMT684|4.0|My almost 2 year old grandson loves these puzzles only Kindle. He calls them his &#34;games&#34;.  The concept of &#34;tap and drag&#34; is simple and he loves the bonus of popping the balloons after successfully completing the puzzle.
055357342X|5.0|This is a wonderful series if you enjoy being immersed not just with the characters but the scenery as well.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Season 4 was a great season of the Good wife. Always suspenseful, classy, and overall entertaining. I'd recommend the show to anyone.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|This game will not load!!! Run time error keeps appearing. I have tried 4 times to Load the game and I can't get anywhere.<br /><br />Please fix.<br />Christine
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince and Paul revisited these Bakersfield &#34;Gems&#34; and with the superb vocals and instrumentation put a new shine on them!
B002RI9S2Y|4.0|I like it very much and would most certainly reccomend it to everyone in the univers to read cause it's good
B00797MB0O|2.0|Not a fan of this movie. Some of it is predictable but mostly the characters seem to old for the storyline.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book was all over the place.The characters were not well developed and the plot was very weak.  While it kept my interest in some places, it was poorly organized.  Just when I got absorbed in the story, the chapter ended and the story line went somewhere else entirely.  If I didn't have to read it for my book club, I would have put it down after the first chapter. I kept reading but it never got better.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is an awesome show. I watch it every day and I'm not the tv drama type but. I. really enjoyed. One
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Sure, it's not perfect, but it's a work-in-progress. Works awesome with the things it's currently integrated with (Google Play, Youtube, Netflix, Hulu Plus). Excited to see the things to come as they continue to improve it. For $35? Done.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is sci-fi at its best. Photography is excellent, story lines as well.... Acting leaves something to be desired but it is  certainly incomparably better than x-files. Overall I would give it 10 stars if Amazon has it as an option.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Do not buy in on the elite you can never get the hard one's in this game bingo blitz games
B00B2V66VS|5.0|TEMPLE RUN 2 IS AWESOME! In case your wondering how to get to the free version of TEMPLE RUN 2, all you've got to do is search FREE GAMES and scroll down(it might take a while to find) and you can get for FREE. TEMPLE RUN 2 IS the sky version of TEMPLE RUN.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|I like this Angry Birds Star Wars it's different from the other Angry Birds and my 7yr old likes playing it to.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Bought this as I love The Vampire Diaries, when I went to play it on my DVD player I was unable to due to area limitations, due to the DVD's coming from America and I live in Europe. I was able to play the DVD's through my computer so was happy about being able to watch them.
B00992CF6W|2.0|well it keeps saying that the people that made it have to updated it or something, IT WONT LET ME PLAY ON REALMS! :( its confusing... and very pricey i wish i didn't buy it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|We love angry birds. My 4 year old likes to snort along with the BAD pigs. And who doesn't like flying screaming birds
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I just reviewing because I wanna give the is app props I haven't actually downloaded it yet bu I'm sure it will be great gameloft makes amazing games so I'm sure ill love. it I'm off to play this bye
159562015X|5.0|I'm in a &#34;career transition&#34; (out of work) and was advised to get this book to help me find employment more suited to my skills.<br /><br />I read through the book before I took the on-line assessment and &#34;guessed&#34; at what strengths would be emphasized by the result.<br /><br />I picked six and five of them were assessed as my top strengths.<br /><br />I think this was pretty good evidence that the results are reasonably accurate.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that the strengths exhibited demonstrate that my career to date bears no relation to my strengths so it's no wonder I've not done as well as others in similar roles.<br /><br />The careers suggested as suiting my strengths are all very exciting and interesting but I have absolutely no idea of how to get into them!<br /><br />If you're looking for some career guidance this is a very useful tool. Probably better to do it early in your career, though.
B0035OC830|4.0|Bryson is one of the better writers today, blending humour with very interesting facts, whether about the USA, UK, or Australia.
B0092G1O8A|4.0|This movie is a really great movie! I am really glad that I have it for my own collection now.
B00469J08Y|5.0|This was bought as a birthday gift to someone that Out of all Disney movies this is her favorite movie. She was so excited when she opened it and when she saw the book with the recipe's inside she couldn't wait to try some. Excellent condition.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie that has a good plot but also has suspense throughout the entire movie. I will watch it over and over again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's so good! And it definitely leaves you wanting more. It's my second time reading it all the way through
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love this app. My phone was having issues with a virus so I downloaded this to wake me up in the morning for work. There are tons of different tones that you can use. I also like the math problems. You cant turn off the alarm until you solve 3 different equations (you choose the difficulty). That way you know you are awake when you shut it off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I purchased this for my 12 year old son it's perfect for him to use his imagination and be able to eliminate pathways to create your own building. Its not like playing with blocks and building things.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is very intriguing and educational. I can't wait for next season. I love the characters. The casting is excellent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Loved searching for clues and figuring out where they go.  Challenging for me at first, but if you take notes as you find the clues, it's not too hard, just requires patience.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I think the Prendergast tales should end. There is nothing new about his character to discover, and these not quite an end endings are getting old.
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm writing this review now (Sept 2013) for season 1 of Falling Skies. I never watched it when it was on live because I really never knew it was on, even though I've subscribed to DirecTV for 10 years, and have watched other shows on TNT (All episodes of The Closer, for example). Anyway, I like the show and will continue to watch the old episodes on Amazon until I catch up with the broadcast shows. It's an interesting drama..... I'm probably &#34;hooked&#34; since I'm nearly finished with season one.
B00DW39B2K|4.0|De Niro was outstanding as a grizzled soldier.  Travolta was &#34;shocking&#34; in his role !!  More plot than I was expecting in this cat and mouse thriller.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Fast paced and great special effects make this a 3D DVD not to be missed.  Love all of the different versions of Star Trek and this present one is no exception.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Great storyline, but sometimes it was tough to keep up with it.<br />Freeman and Cruise handled their roles in the usual manner.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son and this item was delivered quickly and was brand new. Thank you for providing this st a fair price.
B00A4A1KK0|5.0|Our son is 3 months old and from day 1 we started playing this album when he would go to sleep. Now, its his favorite and when we play it, he starts to doze off like clockwork. That might be bad in 20 years when the song comes on the radio when he's driving, but for now it's worth it.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon and Phillip Phillips.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great show.  wish I could download shows instead of just streaming them to watch on the train .  I love this show and picture quality is great
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|The Fast Diet is worth the star rating I have given it as it is so easy to read, provides research information about the plan and options for fasting, includes some fasting day diets for women (500 calories) and men (600 calories) and takes a firm but sympathetic approach to dieters.<br /><br />I have used the plan for several weeks and have lost weight without too much misery. The menus are terrific, but I have also found that by calorie counting and adapting them I can also devise my own menus easily.  In addition, I managed to lose weight on a 9 day tour, with a great deal of walking and lots of tempting food. As the book suggests, temptation can be given  into five days a week, and that really is enough. A possible added bonus to the diet is that fasting days can become something to look forward to!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Quite an interesting game. Not bad for free,but does seem to be very simplistic. Nice game for younger children to learn care and maintenance of a real horse.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|If your a fan of Trek, you would like this spin off.  Never really watched this show, but I'm glad to now.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I recommend this to any family! Love this movie and the message that it brings!<br />It's a great movie to watch with Dad, for sure.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another good book that was hard to put down.. Touching many emotions that makes you just want to cry,laugh, and read more
1451695195|3.0|This book was focused more on how this had to be true and actually happening, versus what I wanted to read about: What happened in heaven.<br /><br />I think it's wonderful this experience happened to Mr. Alexander, and I am glad it did.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Blokus: 2-4 Players (Solitaire variant available), Ages 5+, Average Play Time = 15-30 Minutes<br /><br />Blokus caught me completely by surprise.  What I thought was a simple, piece placement game turned out to be an epic rollercoaster ride in which I wouldn't get motion sickness from.  This game is very easy to play but offers a wide range of strategic play, especially toward the middle of the game.  I quickly saw how important it was to expand, lest I be trapped into a corner without the ability to get past my opponent's pieces.  Not only did I have to worry about expanding, but I also had to come up with ways to block my opponents from being able to dominate the board.  When you have three other people playing, it can be a real challenge to do this.  You might be able to trap yellow into a corner, but blue and green might waltz all over your available territory in the process.<br /><br />Having just played and reviewed Tetris Link, I saw a lot of similarity in the pieces.  They looked the same, except for that Blokus had a much wider range of differently shaped pieces.  I was just as pleased with the components in Blokus as I was in Tetris Link.<br /><br />The kids enjoyed Blokus, especially Devonn (11).  He commented that he used to play it in his gifted classes and loved trying to figure out his next move.  Having played this game a few times, I can see the educational value in introducing this game to schools.  Blokus forces players to think ahead and to adapt to the current situation as it stands, something that I encourage all kids to learn and take to heart as early on in life as possible.<br /><br />The other kids, Carolyn (13) and Vinnie Jr (11) loved the game as well, so much that we all played it again a second time.  All three kids were constantly trying to visualize which of their available pieces should go where.  I opted to try and play my five block pieces first and expand towards the center so that I could branch out and thus have more room to work.  Towards the end, I was able to place most of my smaller pieces to where I'd only have a few left when the game ended.  The other kids weren't far behind and it was a close couple of games through and through.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game for people of all ages, especially families.  This is a great game for kids and would make an excellent addition to your game collection.  It's quick, it's fun, and it's educational.  Any game with these characteristics gets an A+ in my book.k.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Finished this while waiting for time to leave to go to the doctor...awesome! Everyone who loved the shining should read this book!
B003E6LC6I|2.0|More of the same give no satisfaction.  Will not be watching this anymore. Too predictable.  How many more lawyer series can they produce?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just starting catching up with all past episodes of Downton Abbey through my Amazon Prime membership and the Kindle Fire HD.  I love the series and am looking forward to finishing up Season 3 so I am ready for Season 4 in January.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Ok game wise it's awesome. However, you can only play for so long before you have to pay up. It's ridiculous! Plus you have to deal with ads and commercials. Not worth the space.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I downloaded this app for my wife's Kindle, but found it not as user friendly as the Weather Channel app for my IPAD, so since she probable won't need it as much as I do , I turned it off for the present. I may try another app for weather to see if it is more user friendly.
B00C061I3K|5.0|For all it's star power (much respect to Nile Rodgers) the thing of it is that \\"Get Lucky' does not prepare you (way to repetitious, not much happens) for how good this rest of the album really is! 2 faves; 'Within' and 'Touch' (which features Paul Williams!). I also appreciate the fact that it is not like their past work which makes it all the more impressive (re: taking risks) and is another reason why I give it 5 stars. Thanks!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Written with Dutch precision and soundness. Alma is the voice of female intelligence and love.  She asks her questions of the universe and is has the courage to receive the answers.
0743201140|3.0|I bought this book at a discount from a company that claimed it came wrapped in cellophane. This was important because there is a code on the inside cover that is central to the book. Without a working code, one cannot discover his/her strengths, which is the book's focus. The book came wrapped in cellophane, all right, but the code didn't work. After two weeks and several emails to the author, I was finally allowed on the their site and allowed to take the test. Apparently, the code I was using had already been used once and one use per customer is all one gets. I took the test and discovered new strengths, so that part went fine. This discovery will help me in the future to interview with more confidence.
B00F9040HU|3.0|ok but like a lot of other games.Quite addictive but think I will soon be bored with it.Would not recomend it.
B00E0SX118|4.0|Very cute movie...funny quotable moments. Nice life lesson to have no fear and live. And gotta love Ryan Reynolds as Guy.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Fantastic show for adults! Lots of twists and turns in the plot that never disappoint. It always makes me want to see the next episode..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  It never gets boring or repetitive and the dry, British humor is right up my alley.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I got through it, but this woman is annoying and self centered. She is one of those self improvement type people that are really annoying, kind of self righteous. Stop thinking of yourself a little bit and start thinking of others, you are not l'ombelico del Mundo

B004XVMCMQ|1.0|What an absolute, sick piece of trash.  If Jane Austen had known this movie would be made, she would have burned her manuscript.<br /><br />I'm a big girl.  I can deal with the fact that many movie characters behave very differently from the way they are depicted in books, and that compromises are often made to move a story along but BABY! First off, the nuance of the awful Aunt Norris -  a woman who is a manipulative, self-satisfied, mean and fascinating study in behavior & who shapes and molds the needy little Fanny - was just totally skipped.  It's just some disinterested and snotty Aunt. \\"Oh well,\\" I thought. \\"I know how she really is.  Move on.\\"<br /><br />Then the sad, shy, sickly little Fanny that we met in the book shows up in the movie a tough, confident, story writing chick  - and I thought, \\"Wait.  Why did the director turn this into Little Women?  This chick is Jo!\\"  Except Jo never mouthed off to her elders.<br /><br />Then we meet the new neighbors - and instead of sexual tension and flirtation between the boys and the girls, there is touching and caressing in a totally seductive way perpetrated by the female neighbor on Fanny. Who, as a tough girl, should have slapped her hands away and said, \\"I can towel my breasts off by myself. Back off.\\"  Because of who these people are and their important relationship, that kind of behavior shouldn't have even been suggested.<br /><br />Oh, but that's not all... turns out the Uncle has raped and tortured slaves while on his trip to Antigua.  And the way we find out?  Fanny finds (and we are treated to the scenes of) horrible, sick graphic pen and ink drawings that her cousin made of his father and the women and men as he violated them!  WHAAATTT?<br /><br />At this point, my blood pressure was ramped up and I was angrily wondering why anybody would ruin a lovely, old fashioned, beloved Jane Austen story with implied lesbianism, rape and torture, when...<br /><br />Fanny walks in on the guy who 'loves her' having bouncy, gasping sex with her married cousin Maria. Of course, the director has ruined the story already, so we can't just let them run off together like the boring old book. Nope. We get to witness bouncy breasts and loins and hear their \\"passionate\\" grunts and gasps.  Ugh.<br /><br />At that point I turned the movie off.  Maybe if I'd stuck with it, I would have found out that the whole thing was one of  Steven King's bad dreams.<br /><br />I am so stinkin' disgusted that I could spit.bouncy, gasping sex with her married cousin Maria.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|I've had my Kindle 3G for a few years and love it. Having recently upgraded my cell phone - Android based, decided to try Kindle on it. On Kindle the books read like they do on the Kindle 3G and I would guess Kindle Fire, it automatically saves last page read (which really is where you left off) and allows you to add bookmarks to pages. Very easy to flip pages. You can see every book your library (color bookcovers) before downloading.  You can easily view what have already downloaded. Have to say.... LOVE the part about displaying the bookcover whereas on my 3G it's the title only on initial screen.<br /><br />The Nook (uploaded onto my Galaxy Player) also allows you to flip pages and saves last page read but... it saves the group of pages not the specific spot where you left off. What does that mean? Easy, on Kindle Adriod pages are reformated due to a smaller screen, therefore it automatically changes the total number of pages from 250 to 550 as an example. So your last page on the Kindle 3G may be page 5 but on the Android it will resequence to page 10 - whatever page it is, it really is the screen shot/page I left off at. The Nook on the other hand doesn't readjust the page count - what that means is when I go back to page 202, I have to flip through several pages all marked as 202 until I refind where I left off. What is really taking place is that you actually have pages 202a, 202b, 202c, 202d, 202e, 202f  but the letter is hidden, so you have to flip a few pages before you can begin reading or re-read what you've already read or pay attention and don't stop reading until you hit the first new page number.<br /><br />The Kindle Android features:<br /><br />Nicely syncs up to your other devices and it'll request if you'd like to update to last page read - I like that it gives you a choice. You also don't need to be connected to the web in order to read any book you've downloaded onto your device.<br /><br />Increasing font size is very easy. At the smallest size a line contains an average of 9 words, largest font size will contain 1 word per lind. In addition you can also change the background color from white to black to sepia/tan. Plus a search feature should you need it.<br /><br />You can highlight words, plus word search in wikipedia or web.<br /><br />Add/remove notes.<br /><br />I haven't used the feature, but there's an option to pull docs from the cloud.<br /><br />Main difference between Kindle 3G and on your Android.... you have to turn pages more often. Plus there's no voice-to-text feature for those who want it.<br /><br />Though I have Nook and Kindle Android versions on device I tend to reach for Kindle more often.e a line contains an average of 9 words, largest font size will contain 1 word per lind.

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game, first off, is beautiful. The colors and plants are gorgeous and breath taking. It is very fun, but be prepared to wait a while to get anywhere in the game as it takes a while to develop your reef. Overall, I give it a 9 out of 10, and recommend it for sure! Fun for all ages.
B001NA6096|2.0|It's a cute idea, but a slow moving movie.  It tries to give you a feel for all the events that can fill a night, yet the 12+ hours represented in a two hour present little bits to be interpreted, but most are dragged out or do not inspire the story.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|copy of movie was in exalent condition the movie was not as good as the first one so my review for that movie is pore
B005NACYQU|4.0|Thoroughly refreshing read for me. Bit of a mind bender but in a good way. Great writing and a 'couldn't put it down' read.
B00EY7MFKS|4.0|Background of characters was not built up as well as I expect in a Marvel origin story.  Maybe too many characters?
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Been using these for about a week now and am thoroughly enjoying them.<br /><br />Comfortable, around the ear design means my ears don't hurt after wearing them for prolonged periods. I've been wearing them for almost 2 day straight now, and no problems. The only comfort issue is that the way the soft strap works, it pinches my hair and if I don't take it off correctly it will pull out a bunch of hairs and that hurts. Not a big deal, just a pain the first few times I was taking them on and off.<br /><br />Sound is great, very even through bass, mids, and highs. Been listening to mostly Above & Beyond-esque trance and progressive house through them and it's very satisfactory. Will be producing some electro-house style stuff in a few days.<br /><br />Again, I'll try and update once I've gotten more use out of them.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We watch this over and over. The acting is great and so are the plots. So please keep it on forever.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|You can't say enough good things about the Nikon Creative Lighting System.  The ability to remotely trigger flash heads with no additional gear is huge.  I seriously dig this flash on camera or off.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Possibly not as good as Kite Runner and certainly not as compelling as A Thousand Splendid Suns, but I enjoyed it.  Occasionally I got caught up in a bit of disconnect and stumbled about in a literary fashion, but the characters were well developed and I<br />m happy to say Hosseini has written another winner.
B009NQLT0M|4.0|I used this fan to replace the 35mm assist fan provided with the ASUS Sabertooth motherboards. The provided ones spin at over 7800RPM and make an annoying whine. This Noctua at its full 3500RPM is quiet and I run it wide open.<br />I knocked off one star because the rubber pads had to be removed to fit in the fan mounting bracket, they are glued on and not replaceable. With the pads the frame is wider than the advertised 10mm.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I enjoyed the book \\"World War Z\\" so wasn't getting my hopes up for the movie. I rented it on Amazon and though not at all like the book, it was a tremendous zombie movie (or zekes as they are known in the movie).<br /><br />Brad Pitt did a very credible job as Gerry Lane, former United Nations employee that is called back into service during the zombie pandemic.<br /><br />Mireille Enos does a great job as Karin, wife to Gerry and mother of his children. And Daniella Kertesz plays Segen, a wounded Israeli soldier, very well.<br /><br />Special effects were over-the-top good from the individual closeups of the zombies to the mass hordes that are seen.<br /><br />I was very glad, too, that closed captioning was available in English since I'm partially deaf.

B0053FANRC|5.0|This third movie, \\"The Fast and the Furious:Tokyo Drift,\\" is my favorite movie so far in this franchise. I liked the original [[ASIN:B0018OFN1S The Fast and the Furious]] and also [[ASIN:B0018OFN3Q 2 Fast 2 Furious]]. I wasn't expecting to like \\"Tokyo Drift\\" as much as I did.<br /><br />I liked the casting, especially Lucas Black. The music was dynamite. And I had never seen drifting before. It was like cars dancing on screen. Hokey, I know but that's what it made me think of. And I loved the Tokyo locales.<br /><br />Fast, furious and definitely fun!
140006922X|2.0|Running thru the gamut of reviews, I didn't know exactly what to expect from \\"Zealot,\\" although Reza Aslan's early statement that the Bible as God-breathed, literal, and inerrant is patently false due to its \\"obvious errors and contradictions\\" left me with a bad taste in my mouth. After all, I trust the Bible, and the main reason why I don't necessarily read it literally is because most of its books were not meant to be read literally. They are works of literature, not historical documents in the Western sense. And those who selected them for inclusion in the Canon of Scripture did so because of their interrelated consistency and integrity.    Through at least half of the book, I found \\"Zealot\\" refreshing and seemingly well researched. Sure there is the glitch about the Sea of Galilee being salty, but Aslan may have momentarily confused it with the Dead Sea. This is something Random House's editors should have caught. But then, how about describing St. Luke as a Jew from the Diaspora, when he was by every consensus a Gentile? Another mistake made by a rookie who is out of his element? Even more problematic is Aslan's insistence that Jesus of Nazareth was a political zealot, which colors his entire presentation. For example, Aslan quotes from \\"unreliable\\" John 18:36 in which Jesus answers Pontius Pilate, \\"My kingdom is not of this world.\\" Aslan goes on to say that the Koine Greek phrase \\"ouk estin ek tou kosmou\\" should be translated as \\"not part of this order/system of government,\\" making it a political statement. Turning \\"tou kosmou\\" (from \\"kosmos\\") into \\"the (government) system\\" is a telltale modernism, an anachronistic error when applied to the first century. Instead, may I suggest the following: \\"My kingdom is not of (out from) the ordered world/universe.\\" The Kingdom of God that Jesus proclaimed is of an entirely different order, not one of force and violence, but one of sacrificial love (\\"agape\\" in Greek) and forgiveness.    What Aslan does get right are his cultural insights into the life and times of the historical Jesus. I liked his treatment of Jesus' oft-repeated phrase \\"the Son of Man.\\" Instead of reading into it a later theology of self-proclaimed divinity or other-worldly messiahship, Aslan rightly (in my opinion) understands Jesus to mean that He was the Son of Man in the Davidic sense of being a king. For example, on Palm Sunday, He rode on a donkey into Jerusalem with the townspeople waving palm branches, laying down garments before him, and proclaiming him as the \\"son of David.\\" Also, He was sent before Pilate to answer the charge of claiming to be a king in the midst of an empire ruled by an autocrat. This was a legitimate charge, according to first century Roman law, and punishable by death.    Delving more deeply, Aslan's insightful, but strictly human, Son of Man is undercut by those claims of divinity Jesus did make. One example from the Gospel of John: \\"Before Abraham was, I AM.\\" And the fact that Aslan discounts the reliability of John's Gospel compounds the problem. Tradition has St. John long outliving the other apostles and even mentoring a youthful St. Polycarp (mid-second century bishop and martyr). As a result, this Aslan's \\"Jesus\\" is no Lion of Judah. He has been \\"demythologized\\" as per the late theologian Rudolf Bultmann, whom Aslan praises.    Finally, Reza Aslan exaggerates the dispute between St. Paul and Sts. James and Peter, IMO, notwithstanding \\"sola fide\\" stalwart Martin Luther's desire to remove the Epistle of James from the Canon. Certainly by the time of the Second Epistle of Peter, Sts. Paul and Peter were no longer at odds. In 2 Peter 3:15, St. Peter (or an amanuensis like St. Mark) refers to St. Paul as \\"our beloved brother Paul.\\" With that said, \\"Zealot\\" still could benefit from a thorough rewrite and the addition of footnotes. Better yet, should you give Benedict XVI's trilogy on Jesus of Nazareth a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised, and relieved. Seasoned scholarship trumps and ultimately dispels faddish speculation. Fr. Dennis
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Really funny, liked it a lot. It has recognizable actors and that makes it even more fun. I will watch it again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love all the places and levels you can earn. I wish there were more customising you could do and things you could do early on to get big points.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a new young artist since Jonny Lang in the 90's. He is absolutely brilliant. He plays guitar, writes his own music and is an incredible singer as well. I loved every single song on the album. His music reminds you of music from the 60's and early 70's but he is still very unique and different in his own right. I hope everyone gets to listen to this album because I think everyone will enjoy it. The song Broken is so deep and meaningful. I related to it because of some personal things I was going through in my life. I already heard his latest single and I can't wait for the new album to be released. Keep it up Jake.
1616615362|5.0|Ok, so it's a bad Pun, but it's TRUE. The firespray is amazing. Play as Fett, a Regular Bounty hunter and much more. I have won many a battle with it and so will you.
B001VNB54A|2.0|I hate the fowl language!  It could be a great movie but they put in all the junk--language and sex.  Why can't they make a good movie and leave all the filth out?
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have been waiting for this fifth chapter, anxious to follow these unforgettable characters, hoping for some resolution. While this installment was somewhat satisfying, I feel like I was invited to the feast and asked to leave before I could enjoy something like dessert or a conclusion, as I had expected in Book Four. Again, disappointment, no, more like anticipation for being able to \\"catch up\\"with characters barely mentioned in this segment. What happened to Sam and the true Prince?<br /><br />I realize that a work this detailed comes with a high price from the author. The detail, the tangled plot line, characters must overwhelm the author. He has done such a good job drawing me into this fantasy: a first-time trip for this voracious reader.  I pray that sometime in the not so distant future, he will satisfy my hunger for more.
B000TXZP0S|4.0|I enjoyed watching the movie, but thought it ended poorly.  Will probably watch it again. I would recommend it for adult viewing. Bobby.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What can I say that probably hasn't already been said. Maybe that I didn't really fancy reading this book to start of with, and I had it sitting on my kindle Fire for nearly two weeks before I finally decided to give it a try.<br />Due to the fact that I didn't really fancy reading this book it took me a few chapters to realize that this book was a lot more than it seemed.<br />Without going into the storyline all that I can say is that I am so so glad that I gave it a try. The book was awesome the ending was absolutely superb, without doubt the easiest five star rating I have given.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|Love this movie, Play it often, I first saw it on  Hallmark recently.  I bought it and there are scenes that were on the dvd and  not the televised version.

B002OSXDAU|5.0|I adore this book. The character and ideals of Howard Roark are refreshing and have given me new insight into my daily life. A gripping read.
B001CB8NQE|4.0|I loved the series, but year 5 seemed to be a little warmed over. It seemed that everyone was getting ready for something else.<br />Maybe it seemed that way because Sam had moved on; but though the big guy got more play time, he really never seemed to have acting chops to me.<br /><br />One exception;  that Jewel of a doctor.  I will follow whatever she does in the future with great expectation.  The smart guy should only be so lucky.

B0018BB20W|5.0|This is an astounding and ground breaking album.  A all-time classic where every songs is terrific!  The \\"classical\\" connection is a first and is not forced and beautifully natural.  Amazing!!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Very funny novel.  I would love to hear her read the audio book.  Humorous and recommended for any woman.  My husband enjoyed the pieces that I read aloud to him too.
B0018BB21G|5.0|It is tough to find anywhere else in rock history where a group created 7 amazing classic albums in such a short period -- Days of Future Passed (1967) through Seventh Sojourn (1972) are all terrific!  And then such a dramatic fall - as every album after Seventh Sojourn is VERY mediocre -- not sure what happened...  Anyway enjoy the Sensational Seven -- this may be the worst of the Sensational Seven (along with Seventh Sojourn) but is still amazing and better than 99.99% of the albums out there.  A couple of songs have not aged well (especially Om and Dr. Livingston) but every other songs is really great!!!!!  Highly recommended!
B000FBFN1U|3.0|The series is good but is starting to get too drawn out,hence boring. I will start book four but have more books to read and may not finish.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Blake Crouch is a gifted writer. He can create suspenseful situations and knows how to describe heart-pounding bodily sensations and inner mental states. This novel was very well-written which is why I'm giving it three stars. However, I found the mix of genres--dystopian fiction; sci-fi; thriller; and horror--a bit too much, and the entire premise of the novel was just too far-fetched for my taste. I can understand Mr. Crouch's love of Twin Peaks and his concern for the environment (which I share) but he stretched the bounds of credulity way too far in this one. It was like a combination of Twin Peaks; The Matrix; Deliverance; The Road and a few others mixed together. I'd have wanted to know that the novel swerved off into dystopian/sci-fi/fantasy before I purchased it and was disappointed when what began as a solid thriller, morphed into something far beyond the realm of reality. Good writing is crucial but can't compensate for a story so far-fetched it becomes science fiction and pure dystopian fantasy.
B000I3SYEI|4.0|This was a very good movie, as a huge Star Trek fan, I wasn't disappointed at all.  It was fast paced and worth watching.
B00F99EMRE|4.0|They did a great job remixing this. Sounds amazing on studio monitors, but for the \\"Average joe\\", not sure if its worth rebuying the album. If you don't own Vapor Trails already, then definitely buy this one. If you do, then unless you got some mid to high end speakers, don't bother rebuying.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Though Jodie looks a little pinched in this film, I love the message of it. The dialogue is quite good. I love how the story unfolds and the personal growth of the main character.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I bought it with whisper option. I prefer listening to audio-books because its convenient, can 'read' in the car while going to work or back home.<br /><br />One of the best books I've 'read' listened to in a while. It captured my interest from the first 'page' and I pretty much enjoyed it until the very end. I am one of the grown ups that still play video games and MMOs are a big part of that hobby.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any gamer out there. You will have some grand time reading/listening this book. Very fun, engaging and it actually stays with you for months after you are done. Book is focused a lot on 80s, The main character uses a lot of remarks related to generation of 80s and pretty much is one of the biggest fan of that time even though he lives in 2055 where virtual reality has become one of the ways of living.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The training was a bit boring and repetitive (as it should, right?), but the ending was so unexpected that it made up for the boring parts!
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|5 stars because my wife and I LOVED both seasons.<br />Loved because there is suspense, uniqueness and the series is just different from regular Hollywood crap, even if its made in Hollywood. This series has it all to capture your interest and stay with you until the very end... I have no idea why regular star gate had so many seasons and there real thing that is very fun had only 2 and then was cut from the production by SCiFi...<br /><br />Recommend it to everyone.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|This novel is very much the story of a man who is forced by the regime to make choices and who evolves towards living by his values. Adventorous as in novels of David Mitchell, a bit of a love story, and very informative on living in North Korea. Loved it.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved this book and in the end I now truly know what true love really is. It isn't just the thought of loving someone but to think of their happiness before you own. Thank you for this message Nicholas Sparks. Thank you. :-)

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Definitely the best &#34;whodunit&#34; I've seen in YEARS.  It kept me wondering and held my attention the entire movie.  Good job.
B0036FYO12|4.0|Never saw this when it was new - very enjoyable.  Great suspense and great acting (of course).  Well worth your time to view this one!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fun show, some of the science is out there but good. My fav character was the father, he was like a little kid when it came to science.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|Very slow start. Stupid story that makes no sense. Boring and I doubt if it wasn't one of those movies that went straight to DVD. I can't believe these well known actors took part in this pathetic movie.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I do like this game. It's challenging but far from too hard. It's makes for an entertaining fecal matter drop off.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The female protagonist of this novella is a master Forger who can . . . make stuff.  Including human souls, or something very much like them.  Despite her skill -- or perhaps because of it -- she is certainly not part of the imperial power structure.  More like, marginally criminal.  Meanwhile the Emperor is left comatose by an assassination attempt that killed his Empress.  What to do?  How to keep his condition a secret?  How to reconstruct his consciousness?  Find that Forger . . .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This television series is such a breath of fresh air. It is both intelligent and entertaining. Full of surprises and great character development, I cannot wait for the new season to debut.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written book.  The story pulls you in and grabs your heart and soul. VD is a highly gifted writer. I will not forget this brilliant work.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game! I play it all the time. It works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I highly recommend this game!
034580404X|5.0|it came perfectly packaged and in great condition. It was brand new!!!!!! Totally packaged up and its awesome. I would love to write more but im gonna grab a glass of wine and start reading. lol
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Good story. The Druid character has similarities with Jim Butcher's Wizard. If you like Butcher then you will most likely enjoy The Iron Druid.
0545586178|5.0|I loved the first book and the to be able to watch the movie makes for a great total experience.  I did this now with the second book and now cannot with for the next movie.  I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games and Jennifer Lawrence.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|I really enjoy this movie.  I also bought the first one, with Colin Firth, and I still really enjoy it.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Awesome, bought it for counting stars, but the other songs are really good, the quality of the cd is better than any download!
0143118757|5.0|A classic for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of negotiation and how to create one that works. Along with Getting Past No, if you don't read them you're missing out, no matter what you think about negotiating.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|You would like to see more balance in the presentation of who Jesus of Nazareth was. It was not as if I thought the author was a partisan,but rather that he was stating his beliefs without incorporating other perspectives.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Great read. Well written, complex yet easy to follow.  Holds the reader right to the end.  Looking forward to the next one.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addictive. It's simple to understand and learn but challenging enough to keep you engaged. There are three different puzzle sizes so that you can easily work your way up to the more difficult sizes. I love it and might have to buy some more.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book! Tells you how to get to the extra mile!<br />Gives a great guide to get to where you want to go!
B000KIPT30|5.0|I purchased this Amp to help increase the volume on an old Mac. I am using it in an experimental setting under the advice of a former advisor. The amp works well to amplify the volume. I like that it has four outputs.<br /><br />Nice product.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover rushed her way to my heart when I first read Slammed. And my love for her grew stronger because of Hopeless. Hoover writes amazing and life changing books. For the teenagers out there, read her books, you'll have a proper point of view in choosing people you'd have in your life.<br /><br />This book is amazing and so beautiful I cried. It has the quirk and all. Makes me want to look for a Dean Holder.
B005ETANC2|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about the movie itself, its exactly what you want to see in the atomic monster genre. My issue is with The Vault series itself, they are just bare bones releases no menu, no trailers, no extras. When you have to pay almost 20 dollars unless its on sale that's just crazy. This is my second Vault Series purchase and i'm not sure if I would buy another one. At the very least there should be a trailer for this forgotten gem.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Replaced an old 2-port USB car charger (Kensington PowerBolt Duo 2.1A and 1A). The Kensington was solid, but I realize i need more power these days.<br /><br />- My Samsung galaxy S3 charges quickly with this.<br />- It can charge my ipad well in the car too<br />- the build quality is solid<br />- same size essentially as the Kensington PowerBolt<br />- price so much better than Kensington (8$ vs 20$)<br /><br />I'm pleased with the purchase and expect it to last a while. Would recommend strongly.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Used it for wake up while on business, worked great. Love the different faces I can use, and light levels.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Very well made!  Animation is spot on.  Even though there isn't much dialog in the beginning, they manage to get the point across.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! Kept you interested and wanting to read more. Put the unexpected out there for all to read. Could read it again and again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I&acute;m sorry but this game gets real addictive real quick.  The Scratch kung fu minivans is just fun to play.  For a Facebook app it keeps your fingers way too busy.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I really enjoyed this story! Abuse is never OK,  and Megan, the lead character, is running from an abusive husband. Although some parts of this story were easily figured out ahead of time, I loved it anyway.
B007TVANDM|5.0|My 5 year old absolutely loves Pete the Cat! We sing and read together every night! Pete puts a fun spin on practical life lessons!
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Will try again and update in future. So far so good<br />Will try off of phone. This worked off kindle HD
B007IXWL2C|5.0|a very entertaining read! the mystery revealed! surprised me. i loved that she pretty much resolved the issue herself! a lot of fun for the whole trilogy
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|Call us geeks, but we all liked it.  Even my nine year old who promptly joined chess club! Wish we hadn't seen a drug deal, but i get why it was there...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|highly entertaining if you can get past the initial premise of BDSM the growing love/desire and the word bi-play between the two main characters is wonderfully comic relief!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is fantastic and very entertaining. Love this game! It is challenging but fun at the same time. Very happy for the free download of the day with this game.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Great for the Minecraft fan in your family. Smaller than expected though. My 8 year old loves it. Lots of tiny pieces.
B00F5PS5P2|5.0|If you had asked me 15 years ago what I hoped music would sound like in the future, and I had had the ability to somehow crystallize the thoughts for you, I would have given you something that sounded like Chvrches.  I do not have that kind of talent.  Fortunately for me, Lauren, Iain, and Martin do.  I love this album and I hope you will, too.
1449410243|5.0|I have had time to read only parts of it, but it is very good.  My cats could tell you how accurate it is!
149228856X|4.0|The content of this book is widely known because of the many film versions and as many adaptations. But what the book presents is a classic case of the fight against good and evil. Freud would develop the topic later. It is the good side and the bad side that have all people, but taken to the extreme, in a case of psychiatric disorder. I can only add that it is not the same view to read. The literature is much more descriptive than the visual language, but does not seem.
0385347774|5.0|I have not had time to read it yet.  I hope this book will be all that I'm hoping for.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a cool game to play with the kiddos. I don't have any annoying adds interrupting. Lots of fu. For whole family
030758836X|5.0|Great and interesting book<br />Very Enjoyable and couldnot put it down<br />Hope others read books by this author<br />Thank you
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I keep getting a post on my Facebook telling me to get the updated<br />Version or I won't be able to use it. After reading reviews and seeing<br />Pictures I don't want it.
1439152802|5.0|Great Book<br />I enjoyed reading it very much<br />A must read and will tell friends about it<br />Hope others read it too
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app is probably the best weather application ever it shows you the weather forecasts with ease thank you again
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|Rumor has it, this music is awesome!!Exactly what the title says, this was worth the price. And now some more words cause they need twenty total words.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|A lot of fun for a small price. A great way to keep the rainy day blues away or a delayed office visit.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby does a good job with this small book.  If you are looking for a complete detailed book this is not the one.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|It's a good game overall ,it just needs more detail .... like seeing players on the bench...there are many glitches and bugs...I'll be looking forward to some updates
B008RA3X5E|4.0|i like it its good but it needs to let us schedule future appointments so we dont forget them, add the calendar to it please. thanks!
B000CBEWZ6|1.0|Freaking stupid I pay the money for a new movie and I get a broken case with a DVD sliding around in the case freely before it is even taken out of the package. Now maybe its just I'm one of what ever for that but then the dang thing wont even play on my 360 or in a DVD player. If I were you I would save my money and get it else where to save you the time and trouble.
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|Stop working within 2 weeks. I plug it in power cord in the car.  It worked and then it stopped.
1401938906|5.0|The experiments worked & I would recommend E squared to anyone! The universe is amazing as are we! Great Xmas present!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|pickiest reader ever read this to the end. Kept me entertained very ADHD which I guess is why I liked it!
B001DPC4R8|5.0|Wonderfully decorated album! Done all high-quality! And of course the timeless song! Nice to hold 180 gram vinyl! I really liked it!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I found this book to be wonderfully written with many well drawn-out characters and fascinating, interconnecting storylines.  Very moving and a page-turner as well.  Highly recommend.
B005LF9KMI|5.0|The only reasons I posted 5 stars for this movie is 1) I love Stephen King and if it wasn't for the 2nd stipulation I would have probably only given it 3 stars (which stinks because I love Stephen King and I HATE it when they ruin one of his books) and 2nd - it scared my kids so bad that they won't watch it to this day and they're 32 and 30 years old! (they were 8 and 10, if that, at the time :) )  I TOLD them not to mess with my movies - bad thing to say although if I'da said go ahead and watch them if you want, they'da still watched 'em anyway so it didn't matter.  But the fact that my 32 and 30yo sons can't put on their big boy pants and watch the movie without it freaking them out makes it worth the 5 stars for me!  I love it!  That'll teach 'em not to listen to their mom when she says leave it alone.  Dad doesn't like these types of movies so it doesn't matter to him.<br /><br />So if my little story doesn't help you decide to watch the video, that's fine.  But I still give it the 5 stars even though I feel it's only worth 3 for the actual watchability of it.  I'd suggest watching it but don't expect a movie of the quality of \\"The Shining\\" or \\"The Stand\\" or even \\"Langoliers\\" (which, if you haven't watched it WATCH it - that's one I legitimately give it 5 stars with no reservation!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Always love watching magicians. Loved Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman in this movie. David Copperfield would be very comfortable watching this one.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Very well written, insightful, interesting - gives a 360 degree view of the times, personalities and challenges. Wolfe paints vivid pictures of the personal side of being a pioneer astronaut.
B0031RS2XG|4.0|There were some very practical and relevant pointers in this book that are helping me work some ideas through with a current client. It also provided some very rich food for thought in my own presentations and workshops. A book I will keep coming back to over and over again.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|My only real criticism of this well-written, well-acted series is that it is unnecessarily drawn out. It seems that the producers are determined to eke out a full series from what could/should have been a two- or three-part mini-series.
B009X01C64|2.0|after only a few months the corner snap that is supposed to hold the kindle in broke.  It still felt secure so I took my time researching for a new case.  It wasn't long before another corner snapped on the other side.  while it still felt secure I felt if another corner goes the kindle is going to fall out of this thing.  I am not hard on cases at all and the corner broke off with normal use.  To add to my irritation, the broken corner would jab my hand while I was trying to read.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love all the Bell and Rumble bits. They're the best part of the series. :D The character development for everyone in this series is just amazing!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|I am ver glad I foung it, I am tranfering all my LP's to my computer, very easy towork with. It is Great
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Like the Series so far, just a few episodes into Season 1. Would recommend it to Terminator fans. The series so far stayed true to the movie.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|We have always enjoyed the color learning of Brown Bear, but to have it as an E book, is great.  It was like hearing the story for the first time....the pre schoolers loved it!!  After the first read; they could use the kindle to read it themselves.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A little cheeses at times but overall not bad. I like that it's not the same story line as the TV show. Worth as look.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Macgyver is still a great show after all these years. Even the tech stuff isn't too hokey after all these years.
0446617369|1.0|This is only marginally a novel.  It's actually political commentary with a poorly crafted plot and mediocre writing.  Passing it off as entertainment demonstrates disdain for readers.  Authors who respect their readers do not try to sneak up in a camouflaged wrapper and batter them with political opinions.
B000T00PE2|5.0|I wish I found this album earlier.  I heard one song and liked it so much, I bought the whole album and the rest of the songs were just as great.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|Will get the brain working and make you think for sure!<br /><br />Great game. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to jump start the memory and or give you the chance to work some other muscles for sure!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Was beautifully filmed with a great story.  The actors made4 you understand the time period and what was going on in the world besides horseracingl
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|Purchased it to use as a cake topper and it worked great. The birthday boy continues to enjoy it as a toy. Feel that it met all my requirements.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was a great read and I was capture in the story..I really loved the twists and turns..interesting ending
B008SAZHLQ|2.0|Did I read the same book that everyone else read? I did not love Eleanor & Park. I didn't even particularly like it.<br /><br />I thought it started out pretty good and I thought the main characters (Park in particular) were kind of cute. But then it just went down, down, down.<br /><br />First, the romance. Some might find it cute and sweet, but that's kind of all it was. It didn't feel like real, true, passionate love. It was the kind of romance that you might say \\"Aww\\" too for a minute, but it wasn't that heart-wrenching, passionate romance that I was expecting. It was young and naïve. Like in high school romances when people think what they have is ever lasting love, but then they grow up, look back, and realize it was just a cute fling. That's what I thought Eleanor & Park was, and as a result, I thought the book was shallow.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park barely scratched the surface with love and the romance. Eleanor and Park meet, sit next to each other on the bus, exchange glances, read comics together, barely actually speak to each other, then, on page 109 and 111 respectively:<br /><br />\\"I don't like you,\\" he said. \\"I need you.\\"<br />--Park<br />\\"I...\\"--her voice nearly disappeared--\\"I think I live for you.\\"<br />--Eleanor<br />\\"I don't think I even breathe when we're not together.\\"<br />--Eleanor<br /><br />It felt so insta-love-y. Sure they shared a few cute moments, where Eleanor would get on the bus, sit next to Park, not even speak to him, but read his comic book over his shoulder... but they went from that to, \\"I can't live without you\\" type declarations? It just felt way too fast. And even after that point, I never felt any passion in their relationship. If anything, Park just seemed intrigued by Eleanor, rather than passionately in love with her.<br /><br />As the book went on and they just kept sharing loads and loads of silent moments (listening to music together, reading comics together), I got bored. I felt like nothing was happening; the plot wasn't progressing. It was just \\"Eleanor and Park spend time together... then more time together... then more time...\\" But there was no real plot there.<br /><br />And the bits of plot that the author did try to tie in didn't go anywhere. Eleanor has a bad family situation. Her father doesn't want her and she live with her mother, her stepfather, and her siblings. Her stepfather is an abusive drunk and her mother refuses to leave him. But despite this site plot, nothing ever happens to it. There's not even a big climax at the end... there's a tiny one, but even then, the problem never actually gets solved. Eleanor just runs away from it.<br /><br />So overall, I just found Eleanor & Park to be a shallow read. I literally think that word describes this book perfectly. It skims the surface of first love. It skims the surface of family problems. It skims the surface of living in an under-privileged home. Although it does really focus on race, to the point where you'd think Eleanor only likes Park because he has 'cute Korean eyes/skin'. (There are several great reviews that talk about the race issues in this book.)<br /><br />Also, I thought Eleanor was a bit of a jerk at times. She got mad at Park for no reason, she was so annoyingly self-critical, she went on and on about how she was fat, and at the end... well, let's just say I do not approve of her actions.  I was honestly just sick of all her self deprecation and lack of confidence. And even at the end, I don't feel like she ever gained confidence, so there was no character growth there.<br /><br />One more thing I'll note is the writing style. I didn't love it. Another reviewer put it wonderfully:<br /><br />\\"But what really made me want to heave this book across the room was the ping-pong writing style. Rowell wrote very short sections, bouncing back and forth and back and forth between Eleanor and Park's point of view.\\"<br /><br />Although I didn't mind it at first, this style of writing really started to annoy meafter a while. We'd get chapters that were basically like:<br /><br />\\"Eleanor loved the way Park held her hand. It was so nice.\\"<br /><br />Then:<br /><br />\\"Park felt like he was touching something real and genuine. Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly.\\"<br /><br />Then:<br /><br />\\"Eleanor was in heaven. She disintegrated.\\"<br /><br />Just constant back and forth, back and forth. Obviously I did some major paraphrasing up there, but that's basically how it was. Some chapters were less than a page long and would just go from Park to Eleanor, then back again, in super quick succession. It wasn't for me.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book because everyone else does and because I did love Rainbow Rowell's Attachments , but this time it looks like I'm a black sheep. I don't mind a cute, fluffy book now and then, but I have to be in the mood for them. With everyone's extreme love for Eleanor & Park , I expected a book with a lot of substance.. but turns out, it is way more of the cute, fluffy type (which takes me back to my \\"it's shallow\\" point). So maybe part of the reason for my low rating is that I went in with totally different expectations. This book is cute and shallow--it's not intense, drastically emotional, or heart-wrenching.after a while.

0062020889|3.0|See through plot made the second half of the book boring. Not one of Mr.Follett's better efforts so on to another one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Could not stop watching! Got hooked from the start and was totally floored when it ended.  Can&#34;t wait for the new season.
1452126577|5.0|Just like a million other people I feel in love with Tardar Sauce (and her brother Pokey!) from her YouTube videos. Of course we know she's very sweet but that frown & grumpy expression just makes my heart melt.
0451232852|5.0|Connects the major players (Germany, Russia, England, U.S. and France) who shaped the world in the early 20th century. Characters are memorable and credible. Intriguing as well as enlightening.  Descriptions of ordinary people and places as well as the powerful and over privileged gives the reader an overview of place and times.  A wonderful read!  I learned a lot in an entertaining format. It is hard to put down, wanting to read more.  Follett has a real talent for blending fiction with facts.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Excellent movie. Great story! Some awesome special effects. Pepper Potts and Tony Stark do it again! Marvel has done it again!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Fast moving - keeps you guessing - a bit on the gory side,but assume that was to make the story more frightening.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Special effects are great! Story line is great. The space ship was unbelievably flimsy and the equipment was kind of lame.  Still was a good movie.
1451675046|5.0|Great book !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Richard Dawkins work I just bought &#34;The God Delusion&#34; as well. Love his work! Thanks!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Excellent. Well-acted. Visually and aurally satisfying. A story with an interesting ending. Look forward to seeing what they can come up with for Season 2.
B000W4D94I|5.0|avatar has nothing on this movie this is the best movie in american history. the era it was made in considering that everthing looks very real.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|Brilliant start to a new series. A deep new world and magic system full of excellent characters. Can't wait for the next one!
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|I really like the game but I don't think you had enough levels available before releasing it. I was done with both free and paid the first night after about 1 1/2 hours. It ws fun and I liked to the new characters but the lack of levels bummed me out.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The characters were all well developed and relatable; the story was properly thought out. More of a deep read, but worth the time.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A well written guide, written in a comfortable style, with insights on how to better live your life by attracting what you desire by doing. You are what you feel and what you do.

B000I55YV2|4.0|Honestly, the pacing, star power and plotting was almost perfect. This is what all action movies should strive for. I loved this even more on subsequent viewings
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I was never a great fan of Enterprise when it came out. Now that I came back to see it, I regret not seeing the last 2 seasons. This should have been season 2 in reality, it has the captain Archer that we were all expecting.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie, could watch it almost weekly and then follow up with the avengers to finish off the weekend movie night.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|From start to finish, this entire album is classic Black Sabbath - hard, heavy, dolorous, and completely amazing.  Ozzy's at the top of his game and Tony's guitar work is stellar as always.  They sound like the Black Sabbath of old, and that is a very good thing.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|These days, the character of John Rambo has become synonymous with the loud, dumb explosion-fests that were most 1980s' action movies, that few remember he originally started as a much more intelligent and complex character. 1982's \\"First Blood,\\" the first (and best) of the trilogy, showcases the character as a vulnerable warrior trying to survive in a world that refuses to respect him.<br /><br />Rambo (Sylvester Stallone in an iconic performance that rivals the first \\"Rocky\\" as the best of his career) is a former Vietnam veteran who spent several years in POW camp before coming home to a country that viewed him as the villain. Homeless and alone, Rambo wanders from town to town searching for his old buddies from service, all of whom have passed on. One day he wanders into a small town run by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), who doesn't take kindly to Rambo's presence; suspecting him to be a dangerous drifter, Teasle forces Rambo out of town, refusing to provide him with food or any hospitality. Insulted for being treated like a criminal for no reason, Rambo wanders back to town, for which Teasle promptly arrests him for vagrancy. While in custody, the deputies at the station subject Rambo to harsh treatment that brings traumatic flashbacks to his time as a prisoner of war. Distraught, Rambo breaks free from custody and ignites a local manhunt that puts the whole town on edge as Rambo draws on every tactic he relied on in Vietnam to help him survive against a ruthless band of policeman who are unprepared against a trained killing machine who's been pushed over the edge. Eventually, the National Guard, green berets and Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) are called in to insist the hapless police force, while warning them that Rambo is no ordinary fugitives and is next to impossible to take down.<br /><br />The action sequences are intense and violent without being comically over the top as in the sequels; there are several quiet, intense moments that delve into Rambo's troubled psyche as well as Teasle's own warped motivations. The film accurately portrays the devastating treatment Vietnam veterans were met with upon returning home, culminating in Rambo's explosive breakdown at the finale, perhaps Stallone's finest moment as an actor.<br /><br />\\"First Blood\\" is a taut, powerful thriller and one of the best films of the 1980s'.moments that delve into Rambo's troubled psyche as well as Teasle's own warped motivations.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This movie had it all. It was spiritual, beautiful, sad, exhilirating, terrific. The acting was superb, the imagery was incredible. I love this movie and will watch it over and over again.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Best of all 3. Final fight and the chase on the free way is worth the price of admission. Fun!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I love zombie movies. Most of them are pretty predictable, though, and I rarely get a case of the willies after it's over. I enjoy being on the edge of my seat and being scared while I'm watching... glutton for punishment, I guess, but I really enjoy the tension. This movie did all of that, and more. No spoilers from me, just some advice: don't watch it alone. That's all I'm sayin'....
0316204366|3.0|You expect more from Gladwell and this is not his best. After a strong start with David vs. Goliath, the book does not match with the equally compelling and relatively contemporary narratives to match the Biblical David vs. Goliath (with few exceptions like Lawrence of Arabia). A overall framework for the underdogs (that what we all are at some point or the other) is perhaps what I found missing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watched the entire season three times! Every time find it more captivating. Love it!!!!!! Looking forward to the next season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good absolute five star no matter what u say it rules I rule u stink everyone is bad!!!! I AM CHEESE
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The people who created this app must really love horses! I can not believe hot real everything seems from working on training to cleaning the paddock. It really is great! I have a younger sister and if the whole technology age was back in the mid 80's she would have just about flipped her lid as she was an avid horse rider who would show at every opportunity! She would have played this game more and left my parents alone about getting her a horse of her own! I recommend this app for<br />horse lovers and horse likers!!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Fast fun play.  The game is a bunch of short reflex oriented tasks. The tasks are random, and starts slow, but picks up speed.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Fantastic movie as I'm a Star Trek fan and have colledted all the Star Trek movies. I even got to see some of the parts of how they made the movie and where the move was filmed on different locations from a show that showed how the movie was made.
B0018RE7DU|5.0|Loved this movie..even though it is older it has an awesome message...love Richard Gere...never saw this movie before...glad I did!
B00DP8XSQ2|5.0|Love this app. Really easy and cool for a nice night outside. Good for kids as well. Great educational tool.
B00AW57L96|1.0|I have been trying to get absorbed for over a week now and I just find the writing all over the place, cant seem to keep the characters connected to their storyline... Im sorry I wasted $6 on this book but I am not going to continue reading this one, and I almost never do that... but I feel nothing for any of these characters and want to move onto something I look forward to reading..
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was extremely informative. I am  Medical Technologist who graduated in 1974 and I was unaware of HeLa cells and what they have done for science. Ido have mixed opinions on what the laws should be. Very well written! I am amazed at the amount of time and research Rebecca took to complete her project. True dedication.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a page turner from the get go! I would highly recommend this book. The suspense was great, the development of characters were amazing. Very good book!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As some of you may have heard, this follows the adult life of Danny Torrence, that lucky escapee of The Overlook Hotel. If like me, you both read The Shining then saw the movie, do yourself a small favor and reread it. We know the book was better, but the differences may have you slightly askew in your recall. The book was fabulous. I reread a lot of my SK books. In a few years I'll revisit The Overlook on paper then reenjoy this one. :)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz it's so addicting!! And I play it every day the only thing that sucks is when I run out of credit s and having to wait for them or buy them... it can get very expensive!:/
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Such an amazing language learning course! Better than Rosetta stone that costs $100's for one language! Hope they add more languages down the road!
B009G78EE2|4.0|i thought thrift store song was pretty funny and then heard the rest of the songs on this release and realized this guy macklemore is a little deeper than i expected. Almost all these songs make me want to dance and considering i'm a 56 year old construction worker who has never danced , that says something about this music. I also like the message behind the lyrics.
B000NY17J6|5.0|I've had these two collections on separate CD's and before that, tapes, from way back! One of my faves for sure, but until I bought this \\"green cover\\" version with the I and II collections combined onto one CD, I was never completely satisfied with the sound quality. But this new version has definitely been remastered, so now it finally sounds fantastic! And the material? Not too many artists in rock can get away with racking up hit after hit consisting of nearly all cover versions of past hits! And to be sure, EVERY SINGLE COVER Ronstadt has recorded absolutely obliterates the original!! Her fantastic voice, top-notch LA session musicianship, crisp and clear production, great harmonies by bassist Kenny Edwards et al (even Don Henley checks in on \\"Blue Bayou\\")...the original versions don't stand a chance...even the Rolling Stones' own version of Tumbling Dice, as great as it is, does not topple Ronstadt's own scorching version!<br /><br />I'm not enough of a die-hard Ronstadt to delve any deeper into her catalog than what this collection provides, so this is perfect for my interests...if you're like me, and just want the cream of the crop of old Ronstadt material, look no further than this collection...a must have!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Words cannot describe how good this game is......This game is just awesome you should definitely get this game. And cross your fingers that they make a third one!!!!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved it..!! You have to see this movie. If you have not seen a new movie lately then you won't be disappointed with this one.
B002M5E2DW|3.0|Well the idea about positive thinking, gratitude and so on are very good. It was nothing new to me as I live by these principle anyway, but I think it can halp a lot of people find hapiness in life.<br /><br />But the writting style is horrible and the whole thing is a bit like a religion... So try and see for yourself or just watch the movie (I like to read though, cause then it reminds me more regularly of the positive thinking)
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is alright. Barely getting used to it.<br />Not sure if it will get any better. I heard it eventually asked to pay to continue.
B00AEFY5TI|4.0|Awesome classic movie featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton - John with memorable music with power stars of the time.
1932100660|3.0|I found it difficult to read. It was like being back in my college biology class<br />uck... I didn't finish the book
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Very valid and varied presentations of mind sets and how to work with them. Great for educators and all who work with people!
B005DI66N4|1.0|I find it incredible that this book continues to sell and receive all kinds of rave reviews. People, this is an outrageous hoax of a story, complete with a Yeti sighting, as a minimal amount of online research will reveal. Furthermore it is an affront to those who suffered in the war. Amazon should be ashamed to peddle it. Libraries should be ashamed to carry it.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Mesmerizing case history from the protagonist point of view and from the police side.  This is one of the 'don't want to stop reading' books.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|It works for me.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" (2010) is the 4th installment in the series, which started with 2004's \\"Resident Evil\\". These are the only two films I've seen in the series so I obviously don't consider them \\"must see\\" movies and, yet, I have to admit to being thoroughly entertained when I do. They're basically superhero vs. zombies flicks with loads of style and pizazz. You can't take 'em too seriously and, yet, the stories & characters are ironically dead-serious.<br /><br />I call these \\"superhero\\" flicks because that's what Milla Jovovich is as Alice in a \\"last people on earth\\" scenario. She's dressed in a skintight black outfit with a weapons harness and looks stunning throughout. In this segment she meets up with Claire (Ali Larter) and they fly to a Los Angeles prison where a small group are holed-up against the legions of zombies. They seek to get to an offshore ship, a thought-to-be safehaven from the hordes.<br /><br />Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson is an expert at making great-lookin' movies with a cool sense of style. In addition, the score and soundtrack are excellent.<br /><br />Being based on a video game, which I've never played, there's loads of action, which gets cartoony at times (e.g. the giant with the axe).<br /><br />The best part is the women. It's hard to choose who's better: Milla or Ali. They're both great, but Ali might have the edge. As magnificent as these two are, they throw in more, like the gorgeous Kacey Barnfield.<br /><br />Taking it for what it is, \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" is a dang entertaining movie.<br /><br />GRADE: B+
B001VU1NJ0|3.0|Great acting.  Clint Eastwood delivers another good movie.<br />Don't watch it with your kids.  Violence and other bad things happen!<br />I won't talk about the ending...  Movie was a &#34;little dark&#34; for my liking.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|C'Mon! If you're here looking at the product, you already know you want it. Get it. Watch it. Be happy.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|it was o.k. but not as exciting as downton abbey. cant even remember what I saw-didn't leave an impression that I remember
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Thought it was entertaining and was great to while passing time for The Walking Dead series to start. I will keep up with this one also. Suspenseful and kept you guessing. Take it for what it is, &#34;A show&#34; meant to be entertaining.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is the best book I have read in ages! Love does conquer all!<br />It kept me on the edge of my seat and also made me laugh and cry! Excellent read!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Fun challenging game. The video makes me laugh so the game was fun to do. I still cant hold all the moose holes closed.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It does a pretty and does not require to much wifi which I really liked so over all it does what it is meant to do.
0788734733|5.0|I read the book in hardcover, ordered it in MP3 and have them all in Kindle format, but wanted to have an audio copy to complete my entire collection of the Jamie and Claire series.  This was the only medium I could get and cannot wait to hear the entire series from beginning to end again!  It is so much better when you can listen and lose yourself in the story.  It is also a better way to keep track of all of the characters.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson is a great book and the lightning thief is cool. I know I've said it before, but Percy Jackson rocks!!!!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|If you haven't watched it yet, do it......do it now.  The first season is slow, but after that, you will be glad you kept up with it.
1400082773|5.0|What a GREAT READ!!!<br /><br />Everyone should own this great story by a great president. ...........<br /><br />A must read.<br /><br />Keep in your collection.
B005LLSZNM|3.0|While yonder varlet stews<br />His heart seeks new starlet<br />For possible romance<br />In a new comedy series<br />In the south of France
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love playing this game. So much fun.<br />When or if I get stuck figuring something out my family is right there to jump in to take over. I have a time getting it back.lol
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Good playing. I would recommend this game to any one. I like trying to win the stars and cups. Thanks.
B006TX276C|1.0|The start of Forbidden Colors has been tacked on to the end of the previous track. This disc should not have been released with this quality control error. Hopefully my copy is a bad first batch and they fix the issue, although you can see that the same error exists on the MP3 version sold on Amazon. The full running time of Forbidden Colours is 5:59. It is 5:52 (or 5:53) on the CD and the MP3 versions because of the error.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I think this is probably my favorite Nicholas Sparks movie.  I would recommend to anyone who likes romance movies.  Great!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very emotional, touching story of life in Germany during  WWII from the perspective of the children who grew up during that time.<br />unique way of telling the story from death's perspective, enlightened me as to how life was for the German people who just wanted to live their lives and did not want to become part of the Nazi organization. The book was very engaging and felt like a true story.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I enjoyed this app but the interest quickly wore off. I believe children would enjoy this app more than adults.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|So far I am verys atisfied with this program.  it works as advertise and does not slow down my Gen1 Kindle Fire. and works great.
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|I got this when it was the FAotD and I am glad it was free as I would never had paid for it. It lacks instructions severely making it extremely difficult to figure out and ultimately enjoy. It is certainly not my cup of tea, so I will leave it for those who may enjoy it more than I did.
B0000DG00B|5.0|Beautiful!!!!! One thing that makes it better is, I was there! It was great & the Studio Engineer's took time and made a great recording of the beginning of the &#34;Southern Jam Band!&#34; Duane Allman & Barry Oakley were great &#34;Live!&#34; A &#34;MUST-HAVE for ALL ABB Fans!!!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I still have this collection on VHS, if you can believe that. It is a wonderfully made collection of films and, not surprisingly, they all look superb in the Blu-Ray version. The sound is amazing and the video and visual affects are nothing short of a miracle what they can accomplish with technology these days. I am glad to have had the opportunity to upgrade from my VHS set and thank Amazon for making this collection the deal of the day. Truly a great deal all around and a very worthwhile purchase.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved it<br />This book changed me I think If I didn't read it I would always be mean to others with differences,they should make a sequel!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I still have most of these movies on VHS, if you can believe that. I purchased this set for my husband when it was the deal of the day a few weeks ago. This collection is perhaps one of the most uplifting and as American as you can get. And it was a great deal, impossible to pass up at only $29.00.
1451695195|4.0|This is not a typical NDE book.<br />What makes it different is the author himself is a successful neurosurgeon.<br />He writes in a more technical style. The book may be a \\"dry\\" read for many, but a doctor is not likely to write like a housewife or a preacher.<br /><br />Some of Dr. Alexander's experience has similarities with other NDEs, and some parts are much different than anything else I have read.<br />The basic message is much the same, the importance of love and compassion are stressed.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is the medical circumstances- the doctor's recovery in itself was a miracle!<br /><br />Another important aspect of the book is who the author is.<br />This is a science-minded doctor and skeptic when it came to the subject of the spiritual realm.<br />I found the book to be written well and he managed to keep it interesting despite some technical jargon.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Excellent movie that kept my husband and I either laughing or on the edge of our couch nearly the entire time. Great stay at home date night movie.
B00280LYIM|5.0|My favorite thing was that time they had the amazing battle of adventure and surprising moments that make up a really cool battle.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|This was the best book I have read in a long time. It was compelling and enjoyable to the very end! Would recommend to anyone and have done so to all my family and friends.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Delightful read.  The characters and events are believable and it makes me wonder if the author is writing about her own family history.  I enjoyed reading every page and have recommended it to my sister.  A book club read, I am looking forward to discussing Orphan Train with others.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A typical Grisham book where the story line includes aspects of our judicial system.  A good book for relaxing recreational reading. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the book is written in the first person.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I didn't start watching the series until a few weeks before season 3 premiered, but I love the series.  Great acting, character development and overall storyline.
B0064MGU98|5.0|2 favorite actors put together.  Although hard to see the gray hairs and receding hairline, I still enjoy the drama
B002KDUDG6|5.0|If you enjoy Big Band music from years ago you will enjoy this CD.  I plan to play it for my mother (92 years old) the next time I have her in the car.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I love it and I believe pretty much what Criss  says Paul and Gene are dicks it seems its money
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I recommend this movie is base in a real life topic. Human traffic !! that happens all around the world. I don't want to say anymore about the movie because I don't want to spoil it for a future viewer.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Fun game Good for the brain and good exercise for the eyes  Helps pass time when traveling or waiting in a waiting room.<br /><br />Its one you can win, not all the time but enough to keep it fun.  Lots of choices of puzzles.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent. Had similar experience  30 some years ago  Only experienced love.  No dark stuff or evil spirits  It is interesting that everyone has similar but not the same experience.
B00DVKOYBM|1.0|It's the stupidest pool game for real pool it has makeshift rules.30 minutes after playing I deleted because of crappy rules do not get for real pool
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|May be real world events and news have desensitize to the events and revelations in this book.  Or may be it was the writing and the prose, which I found okay.  Or may be it was the foreshadowing, which made the story too predictable.  It just didn't do it for me viscerally.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great! You get to explore build fight and mine. I do think it's a high price but it's worth it :)
B000067FP8|5.0|Gremlins you just gotta love the first little creatures that spawned all the other movies like critters, ghoulies and whatever is out there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game was very fun and very addicting I could play it for hours thanks ....keeps you wanting to come back for more...but hate having to do the face book junk and this to meet an objective to the game because what are you gain I n...
0307592731|4.0|I am familiar with hiking in the mountains and was amused by how she started out and was extrememly brave to start such a journey.  She is a very good writer and enjoyed the book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|this item appeared brand new and works perfectly.I was very pleased with my purchase. I got a great value for my buck!
1451695195|3.0|The book was too technical.  I personnally know two people that had this experience and theirs was certainly different from his.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|There is no way the 4 &5 star ratings are real - someone has gamed the ratings system. This movie is so incredibly bad that we were laughing the entire time - at it, not with it.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Well written mystery that may require watching more than once to catch the subtle nuances that changes everything.<br />The more I watched it (I watched it 3 times), the more I appreciated the acting and the storyline.<br />After returning from Italy, I appreciated even more.<br />P.S. set in the '50's  pre-DNA, etc.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Loved the story and the stories in the story! It was exciting, touching, funny, heart warming, adventurous....a book for all ages!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|A great free language program, use it on my PC and Kindle. Great fun to read comments from other users. Effective way to learn a language. Many levels--many surprises.
0307730700|5.0|What I appreciated most about this book was that it was written and edited to a high standard.  Adam Brown's story is inspirational but in the wrong hands it could easily have turned into another Lone Survivor (interesting story ruined by poor editing/painful prose).  I've seen a few reviews here criticize the religious content of the book but such comments are misplaced. I'm not a religious person in the slightest but Adam Brown's religious beliefs were central to the story and I thought very well handled by Blehm.  Juxtapose with Patrick Robinson (ghost writer for Lone Survivor)'s handling of that books jingoistic politics.  I knew nothing about Adam Brown before reading the book, I was only aware of the author's earlier work.  I'm glad I now know Adam's amazing story.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Fantastic keyboard! Very cool and extremely accurate. It is absolutely amazing how easy, fast, and intelligent this keyboard is. I highly recommend it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Puts a different focus on Christ than Dostoyevski or Bulganov or the Pope. Many things you thought did not add up, are illuminated.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has done it again! A very satisfying sequel to one of his best books: The Shining. He created very likable, and well- defined characters, as well as evil characters intent on harming innocent children. After trying to stop his unusual ability, Dan finds a way to put it to better use and help others. I was expecting a worse ending than what we got, but all in all, it was a great story told by a master at his craft. For me, Stephen King is one of the best authors around!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The book was better. But definitly a cute movie and was impressed, as always, with Nicholas Sparks.I would prefer the movie and books to be closer alike though.
B00382S9TQ|5.0|My oldest daughter got into this series, and I have now bought them for her. The dvds were in great shape and arrived quickly. Will use again.
B00F35BV64|3.0|The first one was excellent! This one was weak. You can do better than this Bay. Many plot holes and cheesy
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I have been using evernote for awhile so its not really that bad. However, there are times when I want to write a note and I won't because its too much of an inconvienience. A note app should be minimalistic, while offering the easiest user friendly way to &#34;take a note&#34;. It should subtly motivate you to type more notes then you would without the app. If its easier to write it down on paper then your app isn't doing its job. you know? Truly evernote is well-known and usually featured in the app stores, but that is the only reason for its popularity. It is overrated.<br /><br />And complicated. If I were to describe my perfect note taking app.. (off the top of my head) it would be/have: minimal, responsive, user-friendly, font stying, manual formatting, customization settings, and did I mention minimal? DISTRACTION is the enemy of note-taking.<br /><br />but other than that, I use it everyday. Mostly because I can't find anything that really puts evernote to shame. and that's a shame.<br />how hard is it to make a responsive note app?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in about 6 hours it was that good. I want to read more of his books
B009GX6600|5.0|What can I say. Hard watching anything else. One of the best shows on the air. Anytime, anywhere. Always enjoy it!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a great movie and had a lot of underlying points to the story. I wish that I would have seen it in the theatre. Definitly reccomend it and Denzel did a great job, I was not disapointed.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I loved the movie more then the first two. He my steel man. I can watch the movie over and over again
B009IH0ICG|5.0|We have a mini motorhome and bought a mini weber so this mini chimney starter was perfect for our needs.  It is compact enough to fit in our small and limited storage.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I don't understand why this book got so much hype.  The writing was mediocre and neither protagonist had any redeeming characteristics.  It was a lesson in being mean.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|While I like the premise and I think the writing is well done, interesting twists and a plausible plot, Carrie (Claire Dane) spends too much time glancing back and forward anxiously at the face of whoever she comes in contact with, esp Brody.  I understand she is bipolar but it makes me think her character would probably be kept in the analytical dept and not in the field.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book.  I was heart felt.  Very real.  I don't know if this author has written other books, but I will read them.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Too many characters. Can't always tell who is inititating a conversation.  Liked Hosseini first two books but I got lost in this story. Reading the book was a chore, certainly not a pleasure .
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I guess if you are a treky you will have to love this movie. It was intense from the first move to this second one. I love star trek keep making them and I will keep watching them.
0634022296|5.0|This is my favorite Songbook, not only does it have the greatest songs ever written it contains it just as the Beatles played it out. My old brain can't remember like it use to and I find myself sitting for hours on end playing from this book. It is the best money I ever spent on a songbook.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch is heartbreaking and brutal in the best possible way. Amazing performances, perfectly cast and great writing. It's a must-see.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|This is the best comedy I have seen in years. I would say is next to American Pie, Hangover, Ted and a few others. I won't be surprised if there is a sequel in a few years.<br />There is one thing, however, that I think it could have been better: Rose casting! I love Jennifer Aniston and have enjoyed all her movies but she is now 40 and the character she is playing is 30 at most.  I mean, she has a gorgeous body during the strip dance at the garage but in the rest of the movie she is playing a mom.  Hard to believe a 40 yrs old woman would also work on a strip club where the average age must be somewhere between 24.... I guess!!!!  Other than that the movie is great and will watch it over with the extended scenes.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is my go to search engine. I would be lost without it. I can always find what I need to.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|I really can't say a whole lot about this trashy but worth seeing movie. One reviewer described it as \\"awesomely bad.\\" That was so accurate that reviewer deserves a 5 star rating.<br /><br />Other reviewers have commented thoroughly. I will only second a few of their comments.<br /><br />Don't expect a plausible plot, fine acting, great dancing, etc. The movie, instead, is thoroughly trashy and phoney, but so is Las Vegas. And, hey, Las Vegas makes a lot of money because it is trashy and phony.<br /><br />If you watch the movie just to feast your eyes on Elizabeth Berkley, you will be well rewarded, even in the stupid pool sex scene. The sex there may be dumb, but she still is sexy. Her character is trashy and just plain stupid at times. But, again we don't feast our eyes on showgirls because they are Nobel Prize scientists.<br /><br />The best scene, in my lowly view, was the lap dance. In fact, I bought the dvd because I read reviewer comments on how great the lap dance scene was. Truly the best one I've seen. Well, except maybe that hot babe in that sleazy club in.... Never mind.<br /><br />In summary, Elizabeth's bod and the lap dance scene are the most socially redeeming parts of the movie, at least in my opinion. That should say a lot. So, go watch it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I have always loved this app on my iphone but when i downloaded it onto my kindle and try to log in it just says &quot;this is taking longer than it should please try again in a bit&quot; Please fix it soon :(
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I really liked this app but it could use some changes. For one, some quests are hard until you get something specific. On the other hoove,  its a great game because you get a gem every new level. Great app! I love it,  and so will you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I, loved this game, I really didn't want it to end so soon... I don't know how many times I said &quot;what the hell&quot;.
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|I was not aware that there was a book tied to this film.  I was surprised that some customers thought that the film depicted religion as the baddie.  If you look at the ending, the main character has to emphatically admit that she feels in her gut that there is \\"something out there bigger than all of us\\".  I find the overall conclusion of the film a bit corny.  I really don't think that the main female character would have  had a romatic relationship with a religious man, no matter how modern or 'new age' he may seem to be.  Seriously?  This film feels very 1980's, despite being made in the late 90's. The concept of  life on other planets is still one that is being researched by scientists today.  In a time of international financial crisis, shouldn't we be spending time and effort on helping one another?  In an odd way, thinking that we can find another planet with life on it to point us towards new frontiers and solve our problems seems, ironically, egotistical--and well, very American.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Goonies is a great movie and entertained my 9 & 8 year olds just like it did me decades ago. Not reliant on CGI or too many special affects, so it stands the test of time pretty well.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Had me hooked right away, excellent show excited for whats to come.  Wish you could rent season 3 as each episode came out
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this game. The only problem is that some games are literally impossible to win. The plane game is impossible but luckily you can turn it off. The hunting game is impossible on my kindle because of the two finger touch screen. It is a great game and as long as you do well on the other games it should get you far
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love all the Downton shows. Great look at English aristocratic life during the 1920's +. Very interesting period of time in England. Highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King books since I was 9 yrs old. This book was by far my favorite. I could hardly put it down.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't read it fast enough.  It's one of those stories where its difficult to put the book down.  A great read!
1572814136|5.0|Great-beautiful colors as advertised. Only pity is that the cards aren't a little bigger. They are standard size and I hoped for larger.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Not scary like it's predecessor but a really excellent read. I enjoyed getting to find out what happened to Danny and Abra is an awesome little girl.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|This was my least favorite of the trio of Iron Mans, I dont know if the same jokes are just getting old, but not great
B00867HDTA|3.0|This game is fun. Flicking obviously gets a little tiring, but all in all this game will keep anyone occupied and entertained for a time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful characters, very interesting to view the way life was for the aristocracy.  Incorporating the history adds so much and is very educational.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Dr Perlmutter cites his studies that back up his information.  I'm looking at food in a whole new light!  This book was hard to put down.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Absolutely love it!!! This game is one of the best I have played. I would definately recomend this to all!!<br /><br />Kenneth Russo
B00F35BV64|3.0|Not as good as the first of the new series.  I prefer they do something to add to the genre then revisit the past.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|What can be said about Elton John's  new CD - The Diving Board, that hasn't been said already?<br />Some people thinks it his best work and remind them of his past CDs of the 70's, some people don't get it and others are disappointed.<br />Elton has been recording great music since 1970 and it is undeniable, throughout his career he has provided us with some of music's best loved songs and biggest hits. And like any real creative person in this business, he will never stand still for too long, it is expected he will always do something new. But what ever Elton does you can be sure it will be full of heart, integrity, and good music. And The Diving Board is full of these qualities. On the Diving Board, Elton is being true to himself, and in the process has created a very strong and musical CD, stripping away the layers of production on the songs and revealing true quality musicianship. Of course part of the credit must go to Bernie Taupin, his song writing partner for most of Elton's career.<br />Basically this is a piano CD fill with great mid tempo songs without any over dubs and big production in the songs. There are no fillers on this CD, all the songs have something special and mentionable in each of them, whether it is Elton piano playing, which is up front throughout the CD; his performance of the songs, which vary from song to song; the lyrical content of the songs and how well they translate into the music.<br />It was believed that The Diving Board would probable only resonate most with his long time fans, but it should be noted that this CD debuted at #4 in the Billboard's Top 200 albums. This for an CD that the first single, Home Again is not being bombarded on the airwaves. Maybe the buying public is ready for some real music from a real super star!<br />Personally I think Elton is once again on the edge of the diving board ready to make a splendid dive into the wide unknown.<br />Good luck Elton!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story line of this book was unexpected. It had good capture and read well. Nicely done! I would recommend this book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Takes me right into ebay for purchasing with one tap on my tablet: great! I would recommend it as an app to anyone who is fairly regularly purchasing on ebay.
B00E6890VC|5.0|I was hooked ever since the first time I heard Recover.  It's refreshing to have music focused on the melody.  And it doesn't really get much better than Lauren Mayberry's amazing voice.  The kicker is that they're even better live!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Lots of info, and well organized  Easy to find the info you need. I use it every day before going out.
B00F91H666|3.0|The only part I really liked, was it made it seem like Zombies could actually be a real phenomena. I'm not too worried.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It did not grab me. I like a book that's hard to put down.I WOULDN'T READ IT AGAIN.iF YOU GAVE IT TO ME.
B00406UK7S|5.0|Was really surprise about this one. I am so glad I bought this one. The action is really good. But surprised me. The location gave me the feeling like I was there. Some of the movies during this era lacked the feeling. But this had me there.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a very useful app for the price and easy to use. I needed an alarm clock and using it on my kindle paired with my wireless speakers works great.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|I have been waiting for this concert to come to dvd for a long time and it did not disappoint. Ritchie is at his best. I like other Blackmore fans wish he would give us just one more heavy guitar album.
B00422LESO|3.0|When  I heard Stephanie Myers was making this into a movie, I thought wow this must be a good book.  Wrong.  I found myself bored while reading it.  The story wasn't very engaging and the characters lacked something.
0553805371|5.0|I enjoy all Stephen Hawking books and this one is not the exemption, every single chapter is exciting enough to read it twice.
B000LXHK22|5.0|It's quite excellent. The story is good but the cinematography is terrific. You really get a sense of the Luberon region.
B004DMIIO6|5.0|Love this one. The Asian are making better movie all the time. The action is really good. Surprised me with the ending though. Which is good. This one is where you think you know how the ending will be but surprise when it does happen.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Best Star Trek Movie of them all. Ricardo Montalbán's greatest performance of his career as he reprises his role as Khan Noonien Singh.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|If you like his other albums, you'll like John Mayer's Paradise Valley.  It does have a sort of country feel to it, but it still has the same soulfulness as his prior albums.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|Works great. Just don't like the crease it leaves on the back due to the folding as a stand. But still works as stated.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Molly is a 17 year old girl living with foster parents. She helps 91 year old Vivian clean her attic as a community service. During the cleaning they discover that they have many things in common. Made me cry.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|Great Movie I love Helen Hunt.  Shipping was free with Amazon.  You will love all her movies. So watch them
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I had the free version for a while and was great. Then I had to buy this one, just because it's really awesome! Your gonna love it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The quality of the Blu Ray is awesome and the movie it's self well its star wars it's epic all together.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|This movie is okay, but if you love Kristin Stewart or Jesse Eisenberg than this movie is for you to see.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I could not put this book down. It had a bit of unbelievable weirdness but still kept me solidly hooked. I have had this book on my kindle for several months. I wish I had read it sooner.
B003G4W49C|5.0|When I first read the story of Ender, I was little more than eleven.  Then it was an opening to the science fiction stories that I still love to this day. But as I  reread the Ender Quintet again, I noticed that the parodies and analogies to life, religion, and human nature were somehow absorbed , however limited, to my young mind. Without having to analyze each important event, the reader can easily see these important observations.  Orson Scott Card has always been one of my favorite authors, with his ability show the good and bad in all of us, and still make a very engrossing story. Good teachers have a knack for this.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Exceptional series. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are excellent. Scary to think this could be the way Washington works. Highly recommended.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|a good basic version of learning a language that common people can use.  Not a lesson plan in conjugating 3 versions of one word
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I would give it a 4.5. It is highly entertaining and each episode is a new adventure. Approx. 40 minutes per episode, they manage to fit an entire plot in. I recommend the series highly.
0785814531|5.0|This book is so perfect, it has all of Poe's best work. If you love old poetry, this is the book to get.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My hat is off to the engineers that designed this product. Installation was a breeze.  Instructions were well written and easy to follow.  My wireless immediately recognized the Chromecast and the next thing you know my TV was showing Netflix movies.  Wow!  I am so happy I discovered this product and highly recommend it to anyone seeking an easy way to watch Netflix movies on their TV.  Oh, you must use the Google Chrome browser because this product will not work Microsoft's Internet Explorer.  I'm actually now starting to like the Google Chrome browser.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|It's rare lately that I will buy a movie. I bought this one. It's a great reiteration of the classic show. It's a special effect movie that has a good enough story for you to not think about alll the bells and whistles.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Caro Emerald's voice and style just sets the mood for entertaining or relaxing; great driving sounds.  Her voice is gracious and soulful.  Most pleased her time is now.<br />Very timely package delivery
0544002318|5.0|The book is inspirational.  I gave the two copies I bought away and am hearing the same thing from the gift recipients.  You don't have to be an ultra runner to get the motivation that this book offers.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Love the movie and ordering movies from Amazon is easy as pie also the picture quality was HD worthy. You should try it
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Very detailed. This movie makes you think about social networks and the amount of time and intelligence it takes to develop these sites.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked this book just as much as the movie. It is different from the movie. I saw the movie first and I never felt bored by the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so good always forget what time it is. Barely even lags everyone should this app it's terrific so letse play
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This was a worthy adaptation of the classic comic. Although in some ways simplified, or should I say sanitized, it made the story flow and feel much less episodic than it could have. Very well done.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This Game, as the title says, is extremely entertaining, but has many problems on kindle. First off, you cannot plug all of the holes with the blood pouring out, because only two fingers are allowed on the screen at once. Second, I don't know how I'm supposed to blow to keep the plane flying, because you can't. Third, I am also not a fan of the random points they take away from you. Anti-bonuses like &quot;boo&quot; and &quot;bad luck&quot; for no reason whatsoever really annoys me. But other than that, it's a fun game.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|In terms of plotlines nothing new to be found here bit at the hands of Ridley Scott and an amazing cast...everyone, from leads to supporting...it becomes an more than enjoyable thriller. The music from Hans Zimmer adds an additional facet of mystery, intrigue and romance and I actually went out and purchased the soundtrack at some point after. Really loved this film.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Amazing action scenes in this film. Funny at times and well packaged. If you love action packed films, this is the movie to buy.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|I really did not think I would like this game, but it was free so thought WTH.. Turns out to be a very addicting game, I like it!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Loved her writing style, half the time I put the book down because I needed sleep but five minutes later would be getting back up just to finish a chapter. Planning on getting more of her books
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This was a worthy adaptation of the classic comic. Although in some ways simplified, or should I say sanitized, it made the story flow and feel much less episodic than it could have. Very well done.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I'd bet this is on target with the narcissism that rules government. Spacey is absolutely the best at being the worst.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Every season is great, with few throw away episodes. I even love the seasons with Jonas. I can appreciate his contribution better now, than I did when those seasons originally aired because I was so angry then that Daniel was gone. Daniel is still the best, but Jonas was a great Jonas! The only thing that was crazy was all the different hair Teal'C had! LOL!
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|The suspense in this move is so grand. This movie really is scary. Very good use of resources at the time when this movie was made.
B00594XOZU|5.0|The quality of the product is really great. At first I was unsure but took a chance and was greatly pleased.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|works just as good as using a browser. Takes a little getting used to the lay out, but after that it's just like you'd expect.
0783225482|5.0|Need to laugh?  This is a great movie for those who think they are getting old......would you make this same deal?!<br />Excellent
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|The album is a step in the right direction musically, but Trent's lyric writing style is starting to get boring and repetitive. It follows too much of a formula, which makes the the lyrics predictable and (dare i say) mainstream POP music-like. The songs would be far better if he would focused less on making his lyrics rhyme and just write like he used to.<br /><br />I am a fairly big NIN fan, they would be in my top 10 bands of all time. I own all of his albums, and see them every time they come to town, but i have to wonder if this album didnt say NIN on the front, would I have bought it? Probably not. Just like i never bought HTDA.<br /><br />[...]
0446310786|4.0|Book was in excellent condition!  It had no writing in it and looked brand new. Thank you very much! :)
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I absolutely loved this season. I was hesitant to start watching this series but as soon as I watched one episode, I was hooked.
140006922X|5.0|Captivating! Reza is a good story teller who holds your attention on every topic. His perception of Jesus differs considerably from mine, but that's part of what made the reading interesting for me.<br /><br />Aslan portrays Jesus as a revolutionary predicting a violent overthrow of the current government, both Roman and Judean. Woe to the corrupt ruling class, because the Kingdom of God is coming, with chilling destruction! Aslan points out that in the political turmoil of the first century, calling oneself the Messiah was tantamount to declaring war on Rome, and thus he assumes Jesus followed the mold of every other Jewish messianic figure of the time. The apparent failure of this portrayal is that the Gospels take pains to highlight the daftness of the apostles and their dream for a military overthrow, repeatedly redefining the Kingdom of God instead as a peaceful grassroots infiltration. Aslan recognizes this, and insists that the tone of the Gospels reflect post-war attitudes of complacency and cooperation with Rome, after the nation's zeal had been stamped out by defeat. \\"Thus began the long process of transforming Jesus from a revolutionary Jewish nationalist into a peaceful spiritual leader with no interest in any earthly matter.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, this process is even longer than I imagined, for in Aslan's opinion, it begins even before the Gospels. It begins back at the time of Stephen's stoning. \\"What Stephen cries out in the midst of his death throes is nothing less than the launch of a wholly new religion ... buried with [Stephen] under the rubble of stones is the last trace of the historical person known as Jesus of Nazareth.\\" Aslan believes Paul also taught that Jesus was God on earth, so the high Christology of today's Christianity began quite early after Jesus' death.<br /><br />But let's get back to Jesus the Revolutionary. Says Aslan, \\"Of all the stories told about the life of Jesus of Nazareth, there is one ... that, more than any other word or deed, helps reveal who Jesus was and what Jesus meant.\\" So differently do Aslan and I view Jesus that I actually imagined he was thinking about Jesus feeding the multitude. He wasn't, of course. He was talking about when Jesus violently attacks the Temple. Fascinating how different Jesus can look, depending upon which side of him you hold up to the light. Aslan's book is one-sided, a very well-written page-turner about Jesus, the Zealot.<br /><br />This is not to say that Jesus himself openly advocated violent actions. But he was certainly no pacifist. \\"Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth. I have not come to bring peace, but the sword.\\"<br /><br />When Jesus holds up a penny and says, \\"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are God's,\\" he is not encouraging an aesthetic life unhindered by the cares of the world. Says Aslan, Jesus' answer is \\"as clear a statement as one can find in the gospels on where exactly he fell in the debate between the priests and the zealots.\\" Jesus says, give the coin with its abominable picture of Caesar back to Rome, and take back the land which God has given to us. This is not instruction to get along; this is instruction to draw a dividing line between heathen and God-follower; a line between Judea and Rome.<br /><br />I believe Aslan contains a few errors in his research, but they are minor and do not distract from the conclusion. Of greater importance is recognizing where Aslan's own strong opinions come into play. Yet this is a book I can wholeheartedly recommend, as both thought-provoking and entertaining.deed, helps reveal who Jesus was and what Jesus meant.\\" So differently do Aslan and I view Jesus that I actually imagined he was thinking about Jesus feeding the multitude.

B00D6DVSAE|2.0|Save your money on Sting's new CD.<br />His voice is as great as it's ever been,  but most of the songs are too folksy.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this, but this CD is a big disappointment:(
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I always watch Dexter, it is one of the best series ever, in my opinion. I had the whole season but one episode was left out, so I watched it on amazon.
B00DICGK24|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies but I had no idea it was going to come from Thailand with a Thai language sound track, which was very off putting, even though there were English sub-titles available.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The people stayed in character, and stories kept moving- it is hard to remember these are NOT real people- especially when Sybil dies.--then of course Matthew is gone-  does t Lord Grantham keep going?  It is his wife but this may break her-- truly not expected.
0425263924|5.0|Love the book! A little bummed that there will be a part 4 but it's not published yet.<br /><br />Grown up problems.... Christian Grey or GIdeon Cross?!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I can honestly say that my scattered brain now is able to focus and I am able to set my goals and make them happen with the guidance and tools I got from reading this book.<br />I'm very committed to my goals and since I started this book I have already achieved significant improvement in my life.<br />Thank you!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It is a great deal, on a nice addition to my mac book pro laptop.  I love that it is rechargeable and I am not always having to replace the batteries.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I got into this show late in the game, as it was heading into its final episodes to be exact. After watching hours of the AMC marathon leading up to the finale, I couldn't resist picking up the first couple seasons on DVD. First off, I'm glad I went with the DVD, which is uncensored, as opposed to instant video, which I've read over and over is not. Watching the show uncensored makes for a more authentic, cinematic viewing experience. The first season only has 7 episodes, so it's sort of the introduction to the crumbling world of Walter White. I don't see how anyone who watches the first two or three episodes can avoid being hopelessly hooked by this superbly written and acted, genre-blending show. &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; mixes elements of drama, action, thrillers, and even Westerns, and adds bits of dark comedy in presenting a unique,thoroughly entertaining story. Full of shocking twists, it never fails to drop my jaw with something completely unexpected. It's an addictive show I can't seem to get enough of.
140006922X|4.0|Understanding the &#34;historical Jesus&#34; as a revolutionary Zealot is a new and intriguing perspective for me. A very<br />thought-provoking academic work.
B00DBSZT7C|3.0|I thought this would be an awesome fantasy film. It fell flat when the language from a &#34;medieval time&#34; was quite modern and included slang and euphemisms.
B00FF7FNH8|1.0|Didn't start....try again ....doesn't start...try again...started then crashed when ran...I'll go back to using the chrome extension for youtube to mp3 conversion
B00F52YOPA|4.0|This game is fun and you don't need a wifi connection to play it, so you can take it with you. It is just as good as the hidden object games I play on my computer. It did get stuck on one level though and the picture didn't have the item i needed to find.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Writing, casting, acting, filming, directing, and music. All of it superb! You should really check this show out!! It's wonderful!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am a HP nut, so not too much surprise.. However, the first one was not nearly and exciting as the second part. This part was more content then action like the others.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This was a good book.  Not the author's best necessarily.  But after the marvel that was the Way of Kings, I can't imagine him topping it until at least Words of Radiance comes out, and this was still a magnificent book.  The pacing was fast (far too fast for most epic fantasy), and the powers were imaginative.  I was disappointed that it was the start of a series rather than a standalone.  But it worked!  I am now eagerly awaiting the next one.
B0054JURZA|4.0|After For Emma, Forever Ago, it was going to take a pretty impressive record to top Bon Iver's debut. I don't know that I'd say this tops his first album, but this is an excellent listen. A little more melodic and produced, but enjoyable nonetheless.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I became a fan with Carrie. I published a short story in \\"Ellery Queen 's Mystery Magazine\\" following advice  from several articles King had written in reference to story technique, and I wrote my masters thesis illustrating what a fine talent and grand teacher he is. This was circa 1985, and no one could dream of the treasures waiting in the wings. The Shining was a masterpiece of deep, disturbing terror. With trepidation I started to read this sequel. I mean, how did the author come up with the cojones to meddle with this legend by expanding upon it? I don't know, but I am so glad he did. Another winner with another cast of memorable characters, and this old lady is looking forward to the next.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|To the very end - enjoyed the funny style throughout the first two thirds and really enjoyed the more grounded codes at the end
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One of the best action movies I've watched in years. Highly recommended if you are action hero fan. You'll not be disappointed.
B006PAV1XO|3.0|Well that about says it all. A coming of age movie complete with the usual sex, drugs and awkwardness of teenage years. There were potentially interesting sub plots that just weren't explored.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This book presents an interesting character in a different world with a highly detailed and interesting magic system (the specialty of the author).  I was fascinated by the process of what the main character was doing through the book, and kept interested the whole way through.
0553801503|4.0|Not exactly chock-full of the most compelling storylines, but you can't exactly skip this one. Don't stop now, the saga only gets better from here.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great actor, his perf is the gold standard for the new series. Leave them wanting more and Chris Ec has done that, with so much craft and art that it's invisible.
B008469DGY|3.0|Not bad, it's more like a driving range game since you don't play a round of golf, would have givin it 5 stars if it were a full round golf game....
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|DISGUSTED that I dropped even a  few bucks on this one -- totally snookered by the writers involved, who should be ashamed --MORTIFIED -- to have released this absolute claptrap. I gave up about 6% in with our hero (a bizarre blend of Lord Peter, Tom Cruise, and Wyatt Cooper) having staggered through about 6 days with a leaking gun shot wound, no sleep, and no food, driving a thousand or so miles from New York to Mexico -- at 125 mph in his Hardy Amies suit.  Along the way he jumps off a plane wing, dangles a bad guy from a window by his (inferior Brioni) tie and at penultimate sight was popping pain killers as he roared through the Mexican dessert on a motorcycle he has commandeered from a group of drug desperadoes so he can hunt the neo-nazis that have made off with his wife--intending to cut off her other hand and maybe WORSE. I spoil NOTHING (since you shouldn't waste your time or money) by saying she's shot through the old ticker and he buries her deeply in the sand so the birds and animals can't get to her...with what? Where the hell did the shovel come from! His Swiss Army Knife? He's in the middle of the damn dessert. Oh, hell. I give up. I WANT MY MONEY BACK dammit.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I loved the emphasis on family, The acceptance of all creatures great and small. The action scenes were pretty good too.
B005MMY5RK|4.0|This was a movie I needed to watch for class. I did enjoy it and received it promptly. I would recommend it.
B00136RVUC|5.0|A great place to start with Stevie Ray Vaughan--there's really no substitute, and at this price it's certainly a bargain.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is dead easy to setup and use.  It fit perfectly behind my flatscreen TV and I already had the latest apps. I am a happy camper....
B004132HZS|5.0|Season One and Two of &#34;Sherlock&#34;  very much worth watching.  Benedict Cumberbatch is a great Holmes.  HIs monlogues as Sherlock are remarkable.  A great Doctor Watson and the most evil and creepy Professor Moriarity ever seen.  Thought no one could ever measure up to Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett, but Cumberbatch makes the role his own.  Enjoyed both the Robert Downey/ Jude Law adventure films.  Very interesting is the evolvement of Sherlock Holmes over the years.
B0026O475M|5.0|The expected &#34;moral&#34; of this story turns out not to be the one it provided in the end. Heartfelt movie.
B00CQRN3QI|5.0|This is one of the classic films by Walt Disney. I view it as a coming of age film for windy. Poor peter is stuck in a childhood that never ends. how boring.
B0087ZG7PW|4.0|I was surprised this was in color.  I had never seen this movie and used it for my Film and Literature class.  It is very good.  Aren't DVDs wonderful:  bringing back the classics.
B000002GYG|5.0|This might be one of my favorite Tom Waits records. It's full of weird introductions to weirder songs, great jokes, and amazing music. Strongly recommended.
B00EZ3U148|5.0|Rene Jacobs surely has his detractors, chiefly when he conducts works from the Classical period (most of the controversy centers around his recordings of Mozart).  Listeners will find him either revelatory or sacrilegious--I belong to the former camp, though criticisms are certainly not without merit.  If his work with Mozart seemed off-putting, fussy, or frantic, rest assured that such problems are not found here.  Jacobs, indeed, built his reputation on conducting Baroque.  With Bach's St. Matthew Passion, Rene Jacobs has returned to his element.  Recall his brilliant early recording of Bach's Christmas Oratorio for Harmonia Mundi, secular cantatas, and motets.  This recording is interpreted in the same vein: solemn but forward-thrusting, reflective but dramatic.  It is just the right mix that puts this record in the same league, or perhaps in a league above, longtime favorites such as Herreweghe's, Gardiner's, or Brüggen's.  It is one of those special St. Matthew's that can bring even an irreligious man like myself to his feet.<br /><br />Jacobs, ever the iconoclast, attempts to bring listeners closer to the sound world that Bach would have known.  The result is a breathtaking experience in which Harmonia Mundi's sound managers work with Jacobs to create an uncanny sense of space.  Bach's St. Matthew Passion, after all, is a monumental work requiring two choirs and two orchestras.  Essentially, the Passion belongs to the \\"dialogue cantata\\" tradition (think about the dialogue aria in \\"Wachet auf,\\" BWV140), where a central feature is two soloists `speaking' to one another.  Bach augmented the idea for Leipzig's Good Friday services by having two choirs in dialogue with one another. Of course, this presents difficulties.  We know that the St. Thomas Church in Bach's day had two choir lofts: the larger, main loft toward the rear, and the smaller loft up front above the altar.  Due to the circumstantial evidence we have left (e.g. the removal of the smaller loft's organ and reorchestations--see Christoph Wolff's book, \\"Bach, the Learned Musician\\" for more details) we can infer that the first ensemble was in the rear loft and the second was up front.  Today with our sound recordings, we typically hear the first ensemble in our left speakers, and the second ensemble in the right.  This recording, however, is engineered to put the first ensemble \\"behind\\" you, and the second \\"in front.\\"  Listen to the famous opening number, and picture yourself sitting toward the rear of the church facing the altar.  You may notice the second choir and its soloists sound more distant; soloists from the second ensemble sound as though they're singing from a distance.  This may take getting used to, but this probably replicates Bach's intention of exploiting the acoustics of St. Thomas Church as they existed on a Good Friday in the 1720s-1740s.  Listen to a turba chorus with prominent double-chorus writing like \\"Weissage uns,\\" and note the effect of separating the choirs out in a larger space; one truly gets a sense of Bach at his innovative best.  This aim at acoustic accuracy is a feature that makes this recording truly special.<br /><br />The Akademie für Alte Musik-Berlin plays with clarity and liveliness.  There is a certain pulse, especially in the full-sounding, expressive bass section, that keeps the tragic plot moving forward while remaining solemn.  The RIAS Kammerchor likewise sings their parts sensitivity to the text: turba choruses are dramatic, as if they were from a Rameau tragic opera, supplementing the powerful narrative forces of Wener Gura as Evangelist.  Surely, the narrative abilities Gura exemplified in his Schubert lieder are a transferrable skill to Bach's Passions.  Johannes Weisser has grown into a strong baritone since his breakout performance as Don Giovanni.  Bach's expert composition of Jesus's recitatives paints a complicated, almost operatic image of Jesus that is at times noble and potent, but other times human and vulnerable.  Weisser proves he is up to the task.  Sunhae Im and Bernarda Fink are a joy to listen to, as always.  Rising star Topi Lehtipuu is a strong tenor, and I do hope Jacobs, or perhaps another conductor, will utilize Lehtipuu's effortless lyric tenor as an Evangelist--in the St. John Passion perhaps?  The boy choir in the first and last numbers of the First Part is simply heavenly.<br /><br />The tempi here are notably moderate.  Detractors of Jacobs's Mozart should be pleased at this.  Jacobs's Christmas Oratorio, secular Bach cantatas, and motets likewise didn't feature the rapid shifts in tempi or dynamics that many listeners took issue with in his Mozart.  For example, the famous opening double choir \\"Kommt, ihr Töchter\\" clocks in at 8-and-a-half minutes, on par with comparable recordings of the St. Matthew.  Jacobs is indeed at home with Bach. Some interesting artistic choices here include the lute obbligato in \\"Ja, freilich--Komm, Süßes Kreuz,\\" rather than the usual viola da gamba.  This famous aria did, in fact, have a lute obbligato in the earliest version (which included only one continuo section for both ensembles, and no soprano in ripieno for that matter!)  The version with viola da gamba is included in the appendix.  The soprano aria \\"Aus Liebe\\" is taken at a slightly quicker tempo, but so much the better.  Many recordings dangerously border on ponderous here; some are taken so slow that the listener loses a sense of melody.  Sunhae Im tackles this deceptively difficult aria with birdlike ease and control.  The secco recitatives are supplemented with a lute.  There is little evidence historically for such an addition (Likely, Bach's first ensemble had an organ and the second had a harpsichord, as in the recording by the Dunedin Consort on Linn Records.)  Interestingly, Jacobs also added a lute continuo in the secco recits in his Christmas Oratorio.  Nonetheless, it is musically effective.  Further, Jacobs freely moves between using a full chorus and one-voice-per-part (OVPP).  Chorales are sung with the full power of the RIAS Kammerchor, while some turbae are judiciously scaled down according to the text.  In the liner notes Jacobs lays down his apprehensions of using OVPP for choral numbers, and he does so persuasively (though I still belong to the OVPP camp).  Indeed, among musicologists and fans of Baroque church music, it is a topic as divisive and hot-button as American party politics.  We may never know whether Bach used a full chorus or OVPP, but in this recording Jacobs finds an appealing, dramatic, and judicious middle-ground between the two opposing musicological camps.<br /><br />In comparison to the competition: it is more dramatic than Herreweghe's, much cleaner than Harnoncourt's, less rigid than Gardiner's.  I estimate that this will be the recording that I reference as the standard for Bach's magnum opus for quite a while.  Absolutely not to be missed.

B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Perhaps my family did not have the money to take me to these films. I know I did not see them as a child. I found this film to be very comforting, as Dumbo does do the things he CAN do and TRIUNPHS.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game.  The graphics are A++++. Navigating is easy and the clues are just right when I am beginning to become frustrated.  I have spent days on this game.  I don't know how many levels but it certainly has entertained me.  I would gladly pay good money for this game.  Kudos to the developers.  Let me know what else you have created!  I'm in!
B000004286|3.0|This is the kind of soundtrack that is only for the completist. Not sure why I bought this, and I certainly wouldn't do so again. Great soundtrack, but not the kind of thing that holds up for many repeat listens.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Amazing storyline. Draws you in on the first episode and does not let go until the very end! The work of pure genius.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was well worth the wait. I never want to give too much away but I have to say this, to me, is one of my favorites. As a recovering alcoholic myself I found this book really speaking to me. This is a return to The Masters roots. It is unflinching and absolutely riveting. Do not expect The Shining. This is not that. It is the story of Daniel Torrance and the battle with his demons, most of them very personal. Thank you Mr. King you truly are the great story teller. This book has helped me like no other ever has and scared me very good too.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This well acted movie had an interesting story.  Could have been a bit shorter, was slow in places.  Well worth it for home viewing.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Easy to read, interesting.  Uplifting, spiritual.  A testament of how people can change.  It's especially meaningful, as it is based on true characters.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just started an hour ago and I cannot put it down. the puzzles are fun and they objects et harder to find.
0553381687|5.0|I would imagine that at this point, you're either buying this because you like the show, or because you need a spare copy to lend someone else who just started watching the show and now wants to read the books. Highly recommended.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|As monster movies go it was pretty good. It was kind of like a Godzilla movie but with an actual plot. Yes the physics are completely ridiculous, but if you just want lots of cool fighting and explosions, and you are fan of monster movies, you will probably like this.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I read a great deal of books across many genres and am not particularly picky. There have been many times I have purchased a book from an unknown author on Kindle and been pleasantly surprised. This was not one of those times.  Although the premise was intriquing, the writing was extremely juvenile.  I could not make it past 10%.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I am a scifi kind of person anyways but I am also a fan of Stephen King, so this series already was on my watch list. After watching it I really enjoy how each episode has a new story.
B00555X8OA|3.0|Parts of the book were interesting to me, but parts were for economists and good mathematicians.  Being neither, I just enjoyed the psychology analyses.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The next step for Ender, a manhood to make up for the mistakes of his youth!  Will the many noble things he does as an adult, right the wrongs of youth.  I just love this series, so glad I found it after all four books were written-reading the last one slowly and will be reading more from Orson Scott Card!  Thought provoking without wearing your mind down, but instead inspiring you to greatness!  Ok maybe not greatness just an understanding of how we don't walk this or any other world alone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyable game that keeps your interest through the levels. Not overly difficult but still a challenge. I enjoyed this game and would recommend to all who love puzzle games.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|What can I say?  It's The Big Bang Theory.  Although we don't like two episodes.  The valentine's day episode (Penny is incredibly rude throughout), and the Comic Con/Star Trek cosplay episode.  Ugh.  Painful to watch.

B009JZSC9S|5.0|This follows up on the season three story lines. Love the guest actors who are on for a series of shows, not just one!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This movie was not one I jumped to go so see at the theater. My mistake, it is a beautifully told story. I would recommend this for children over 14 & all adults. Your heart & mind will be filled.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is a different zombie-like movie with awesome special effects and full of actions from start to end. I loved it!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Since my early teenage years I always actively avoided organized religion. By my early teens, I was solid in my lack of religious belief and affiliation. Now, in my mid-30s, I found my overall feeling about religion unchanged, but - simply because I have not been actively thinking about it for years -  when I found myself in a moderately heated discussion about the merits/evils of religious upbringing, I realized that I do not have rock solid arguments to support my opinion.<br />This book contains those rock solid arguments. While none of them would be sufficient to turn a believer into a non-believer (hey, that's why they are believers, right? they believe things whether supported by evidence or not.. they choose to believe!), this is an excellent explanation to the logical, non-believing human why god is not only a delusion, but also a dangerous one.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Exciting, I'm watching 2-3 episodes a day.  I love Leonard Nemoy in the plot. Going to watch all the seasons.
B005PK57IK|5.0|It is especially good to watch the past seasons commercial free to catch up on all the story line. Good writers, good performances by the actors!
B000002H7I|5.0|I have always loved Tracy's voice, but I love the fact that she doesn't see herself as a superstar or celebrity.  She sings with passion and from the heart, and fans are never distracted by flashy outfits and glitzy jewelry.  Tracy is unpretentious in her dress and appearance, and she doesn't need any accompaniment--her music peaks for itself!
9700515680|5.0|I had read this book once before and it instantly became my favorite, so I decided to get my own and oh what a nice surprice it was! Hardcover, wih drawings, and a cover that maes it seem misterious. I am so happy with it. It is the heart of my library!

B00AYB1RXE|5.0|I heard about this movie because of its Oscar award, but didn't pay attention because a documentary film is often educational but boring. This one is beyond a documentary. It is an unbelievable, unlikely story of a man who has a soul. It is definitely worth the money.

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|\\"A Memory of Light\\" is the 14th and final book in the Wheel of Time series.  It wasn't the ending, but it was a satisfying ending to this epic fantasy story.  I thought it started out a little slow especially with jumping between so many different points of view, but it eventually came together for a satisfying conclusion that left plenty of room for thought and discussion as to how Jordan/Sanderson brought all the story arcs together.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me throughout the series was that none of the main characters died.  This is no longer true after this last book, and it only makes sense considering it was \\"The Last Battle\\".  I was a bit surprised that more beloved characters didn't meet their Creator by the time the story was over.<br /><br />The chapter covering the \\"The Last Battle\\" was extremely long, but I thought Sanderson did a great job building up the suspense as he described how the battle generals made their moves, feints, and bold attacks in an attempt to gain the upper hand.  This final book had a lot of action involving the Aeil, the White Tower, the Black Tower, Rand, Perrin, and Mat, and I thought it had a satisfying conclusion to wrap up the story.<br /><br />Rand's struggle against the Dark One was interesting, but I enjoyed Perrin, Mat, and Egwene's battles even more.  There were moments I found myself cheering on those fighting for the Light, and even moments where  I got goosebumps as spectacular scenes of honor and courage leaped off the page to tell this incredible story.<br /><br />Overall, the middle books are a bit of slog as it felt like Jordan let the story arcs run away a bit, but I still found them interesting.  They just didn't have the same level of excitement and sharpness that the early novels and these last three books held.  If readers make it through the middle novels, I think they will be pleased with the series and this last book.

Would you like to find out what he learned from his experience? Beautiful and romantic ending I can't forget for a long time.

B009B0CZXU|4.0|What I really like is that Khan changes significantly with this album without being drastic or reinventing the wheel for its own sake. This outing is a little darker in many places, but never gets depressing. None of the songs on this album are quite as radio-friendly as \\"Daniel\\" was, but many are still catchy. Great album.

B005LAIIGM|5.0|Inevitably, there will be those how nit-pick this or that aspect of this very realistic, minimalist film. I, on the other hand, found it surprisingly good. Why reviewers have made mention that Sandra was not the first or, allegedly, even the fifth actress offered this part is entirely beyond me. Of the names mentioned that were offered the part before her, I believe, going in, she would have done a better job than any of them. As it turns out she did an excellent, completely credible job. An attractive 50 years of age, she is credible in the role in ways that the younger actresses simply would not have been. If you've seen the film, can you imagine Scarlet Johansen doing as good a job in this role?<br /><br />Also, I think it was a particularly gutsy move to kill off the male lead... and the minimalism of both the plot and the number of actors in this film attests to how strong it had to be artistically in order to pull off its high entertainment value. For me, this film is strong and would pair particularly well as a double feature with \\"The Abyss.\\" After the film, I was moved to reflect that space may be a necessary playground for scientists, but it will remain far too technical and dangerous (much less expensive)to think that even semi-ordinary people will end up there on holiday anytime in the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Finally, I particularly appreciate a science fiction movie with such a strong human element. The movie is a human drama set in near-earth orbit instead of the typical SciFi where machines, unbelievable action stunts, and spectacular visuals must carry the audience. Thanks to George Clooney's journeyman performance and Sandra Bullock's dogged determination to keep it real, this film earns a place in my SciFi library when many other alleged \\"block-busters\\" have and will not. See the film on its own terms, and look past the surface panoramas. The last scene when Sandra digs her fingers into the wet sand of terra firma \\"again for the first time\\"says it all.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I didn't know too much about Me Before You before I picked it up and started reading.  I thought the cover was fun and funky, and had a vague recollection of a positive blurb in a magazine.  I'm glad I stumbled into this book without knowing too much about the plot--I'm not too much of a romance buff, but I was pleasantly surprised by this story.  Instead of the usual boy-meets-girl, the concept here is that girl (Lou) is hired to look after quadriplegic man (Will), paralyzed when a motorcycle struck him as he crossed the street.  Lou and Will must interact for 8 hours each day as it is her job to keep him company and assist him with daily activities.  Emotions ensue.<br /><br />Glance through the .gifs featured on Goodreads reviews of Me Before You, and it appears to be the most devastating novel ever written. Although I didn't find it that heartbreaking, there were some times I chose to put the book down and take a break; it is some seriously heavy reading material, confronting moral issues and human emotions with the same brutal honesty of a Jodi Picoult story.<br /><br />All the love aside, what I really appreciated about this book was its broach of a topic I haven't often encountered in popular fiction, the day-to-day experience of a quadriplegic man in our world.  As Lou began to see the world from Will's perspective, I did too.  Lou points out: \\"There are things you don't notice until you accompany someone with a wheelchair.  One is how rubbish most pavements are, pockmarked with badly patched holes, or just plain uneven.  Walking slowly next to Will as he wheeled himself along, I saw how every uneven slab caused him to jolt painfully, or how often he had to steer carefully around some potential obstacle.\\"  Moyes does a great job of describing the discomfort people have when interacting with someone who is paralyzed or immobile.  There are failed handshake attempts, people obviously attempting to avert their eyes, and others noticeably staring.<br /><br />Me Before You was similar, in some ways, to The Dive From Clausen's Pier by Ann Packer.  In that book, a young man is paralyzed after a dive into a shallow lake, and his fianc&eacute; chooses to flee the situation.  The Dive from Clausen's Pier shows us the significant other's perspective.  In Me Before You, Will's girlfriend has already tried to make it work and left him; we see the aftermath of this from his perspective rather than hers.  Both books are worth checking out.<br /><br />This was the first book by Jojo Moyes I had read.  Her latest novel is called The Girl You Left Behind and sounds to be in the same love-through-history vein as Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter, which was a hit.Before You was similar, in some ways, to The Dive From Clausen's Pier by Ann Packer.

Well, this book is for that kid. I found it depressing, bizarre, completely random and sadly, uninteresting. Unless this requires reading between the lines on top of actual reading, this was a waste of an afternoon. I am incredibly thankful for receiving this as a gift because books made the best gifts and luckily, I didn't not have to pay for this particular one.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|After watching the roller coaster ride that was Season 2, it will be interesting to see how they maintain the interest level of viewers with Brody and Carrie separated by thousands of miles. Great for Saul that he is moving up in the CIA hierarchy, but how much strain will this put on his relationship with Carrie? Stay tuned, I guess......

B0012GMW7A|4.0|I'm not a Leonard Cohen \\"fan\\".  Just want to state that up front.  Like so many people who were enthralled by that poignant moment in the Shrek movie where \\"Hallelujah\\" is being sung I wondered who penned that wonderful song.  But I didn't take the time to find out.  Little did I know at that time that I had been introduced to Cohen in both music and verse previous to this.<br /><br />I think that I was first introduced to Cohen in verse when I was in college and exploring poetry.  I picked up a book of his collected verse (\\"Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs\\") from a Tower records while on vacation; I was instantly struck by his interweaving and twining of the eros and the agape loves, such as is found on \\"Hallelujah\\".  I confess that I didn't know that he was a musical artist as well at that time.  But not long after one of my favorite bands, Human Drama, covered Cohen's \\"If It Be Your Will\\" on their magnificent album \\"Pin Ups\\" (they also did a cover of \\"Dance Me To the End of Love\\" on their final album \\"Cause & Effect\\" and round their Cohen covers out with \\"Who By Fire\\" on their live album \\"14,384 Days Later\\").  I also came across \\"If It Be Your Will\\" covered by a band called The Lost Dogs (\\"The Green Room Serenade, Part 1\\"--the Drama cover was by far better).  And then earlier this year I read a book called \\"Broken Hallelujahs\\" (by Christian Scharen) who entitled his book after \\"Hallelujah\\" and devoted a chapter to Cohen.  I just had to hear what all the fuss was about for myself.<br /><br />I picked \\"Various Positions\\" to check out Cohen.  I love his verse, his lyrics, and I can enjoy his songs but his smokey close to monotone singing while very clear just doesn't compel me as other singers do.  What gives his songs more depth is his vocal pairing with other singers.  Some of the slower, languorous songs (such as \\"Hunter's Lullabye\\" and \\"The Law\\") seem to suck the energy out of the air around me if I'm being honest.  Though I doubt I'll be picking up other Cohen work I'm glad that I dipped my feet in.  Songs like \\"Hallelujah\\", the lilting \\"Heart With No Companion\\", and the gentle sway of \\"Night Comes On\\" both manage to comfort and intrigue simultaneously.  They are important slices of life, reflections of the sun and the moon, man and woman, Creator and created.<br /><br />Five stars for his verse.<br />Four stars for his musical structures & melodies.<br />Three stars for his vocals and too often slow tempos.r Cohen work I'm glad that I dipped my feet in.

B00E97AZZK|5.0|I loved this movie because I did not see the end coming..plus who doesn't love magic! Plus it has a fantastic line up of actors.
B0044KI79S|5.0|Fabulous!  Too graphic for kids!  On edge of your seat!  Highly recommend ALL of Supernatural!! Gripping, Scary, Suspenseful, and Action Packed!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was such an interesting read. Enjoyed the main characters & the story line.<br />It is not a heavy read, but kept you wondering about how all was going to turn out.<br />Very enjoyable!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|A must see movie you can watch over and over again and again.even after you saw it at the show.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Admittedly \\"Clash of the Titans\\" had a bit to live up to especially for those sentimental fans of the original and it was a pretty decent remake of that classic.  And it did well enough financially to give a sequel a go.  But does Wrath stand on it's own two feet?<br /><br />I think that the legs that \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" stand on are a bit shaky.  While Kronos is visually impressive (and, yes, the visuals in a film like this are something that we want to be impressed by) I can't say the same about the rest of the film.  The action moves too fast for an eager monster-watcher to really enjoy, except for the Cyclopses, and they come off looking a bit awkward (it made me long for the days of old when Harryhausen let loose his stop-motion magic on the masses).  The reteaming and reconciling of Zeus and Hades barely registers emotionally and Perseus, the everyman hero, earns little sympathy on his knight's errand to save mankind.  The only character that I found sympathetic (no doubt in part because she is also lovely) was Rosamund Pike as Andromeda.  The usually great Bill Nighy was wasted in this film in the figure of the dimly lit Hephaestus.  Sam Worthington's Perseus is given surprisingly little depth even as he is a father and has more to fight for than in the last film!  The complexities of the grandfather-to-father-to-son relationships in this film, as much as it strains to show their fragility in tension and strength in bond, just doesn't hit the heart target.<br /><br />Oh, well.  That's not why I was watching this movie anyway but it would have made it more enjoyable if it had managed these emotional connections and given us an actioner wherein we could savor some of the visuals.  If they continue this series (and why would they?) they should introduce new blood and plumb new mythologies (how about a story about how Hades abducted Persephone?) and take more care in how they construct the action.  Oh, and get some new actors too.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|There is so much variety and richness available to me. The talks are quick, full of information, and a joy to listen to.  Thank you.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Loved this book alas it was easy to understand and brought awareness to the negative power of ingesting gluten, carbs and sugar; also how dangerous statins are for our overall health. I would recommend this book for everyone to read! It will change your viewpoint on drugs, grains and your overall health management.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great all around movie. Acting and special effects were fantastic. Plot was very interesting. Ingenious how they tied together the original Star Trek plot lines with the new cast. Highly recommended. Just can't beat a well put together Star Trek movie.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I love this movie...<br />Action pack...one of the best action movies that I have ever seen...<br />Donnie Yen is a very good actor as well...
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|It's a great game. I could play it all day, it only has some minor problems but other than that it's good
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game!  Great puzzles to unlock and if you get stuck there are clues to help you.  I would recommend this<br />game to anyone!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I found \\"Into Darkness\\" pretty much a bore. While I am generally fond of the cast, esp Kirk and Spock, the story line/plot was a letdown esp when compared to the first episode of the new series. \\"Darkness\\" failed to pass two of my tests for really liking a movie: the fidget test and the popcorn test. Firstoff, the movie made me fidget throughout--not a good sign and one that indicates boredom on an intellectual level. Secondly, I found munching on the popcorn much more captivating than trying unsuccessfully to \\"get into\\" the movie. Overall, I'd have to rate this one about two out of five stars even though every fiber of my being desperately wanted to love it!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am over half way through Fifty Shades Darker and I find it much easier to read than the first book of the Trilogy.  Christian is definitely a person with many issues, but as time goes on, you begin to understand why he is like he is...I really am beginning to see what Ana sees in him.<br /><br />Definitely another great read!
0307346617|4.0|I like the book but some things got left unanswered where others got tied in. like there is talk of a flight and how it changed things but they never say how. it seems like it would have been an interesting story but was left out. then other stories that were tied into each other I a small way that drew the story together like Sharon the feral girl found and rehabilitated but it wasn't known where she had originally come from only to find a small reference to where she may have come from in another story. these are just some examples from both sides.if you are like me and don't always have time to sit and read a book this is a good one because you can read  one chapter and not be lost or have to refresh your memory when you sit back down to read again. it follows various people from all walks of life through the turmoil of a zombie apocalypse. who could ask for more?
B00F35BV64|5.0|I LOVE, love, love this movie!  It is action packed with a great story line and believable characters.  I highly recommend that any one who is a scifi fan watch this.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I am not a zombie fan (or so I thought), but we went to go see the movie on a lark and enjoyed it.  Then I decided to read the book after reading Jason Cronin's books.  What a nice surprise.  I could not put the book down.  I loved the style, the detail and the entire narrative.  Very enjoyable escapism.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Excellent puzzles.  Great exercise for logic and deductive reasoning. It's great for kids and adults, alike.  My only complaint is that I can't put this down...

B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Its a fun app worth  the money but ive run into nothing really besides the new update reseting my rank completely including  my in app purchases which I would like refunded other than that ive really enjoyed this game and before losing everything I would rate 5 star
B00821OX98|5.0|Really good series for sci fi aliens invading the earth.  Special scenes in the filming looked real unlike some series look terrible with their action scenes.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|I realized while reading this book that most of my impressions of WW II were from movies which were almost propaganda (John Wayne etc.). My father fought in the war but never talked about it. I have also read a few factual books on the war in the past 50 years but they were limited to individual battles, this book will give you more detail than you can probably adsorb but you will have a well rounded understanding of the military forces involved, the politics, and the tragedy and brutality of the war. Well worth the time and money to help in understanding an important period of world history.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The movie was so cheesy I think I'm going to be film constipated for a long time. The acting was just above board, Morgan Freeman should retire and the last scene was a insult to French culture. It you are drinking or on drugs this is a great movie! One star for the laugh out loud moments and one more star for the fun chase scenes.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS is the only show that we won't miss and the only series that we have faithfully followed.  We have watched it since the beginning and love the 'family' of NCIS actors and actresses.  We have tried others but just can't get into them.  Sorry they killed off Mike Franks and sorry they took so long to get rid of the bad guys....we hate when anyone tries to hurt &#34;our guys&#34;.  Love Abby, love Gibbs, love McGee.  We have every season and when nothing good is on TV, we pull out NCIS.

B00C7E3EFU|5.0|This dvd came quickly and in safe packaging, excellent experience. I highly recommend purchasing in the future from this sellar. I bought this for the bonus interviews and it is still my favorite horror movie.

B00B19DW0E|2.0|Rough, vulgar, dark, too much of the underbelly of all that is wrong in this world. Maybe it is a guy's thing.
B004SBULWE|5.0|it is a great ides so your phone won't run out of battery. I will recoment this to all the android users.
B001KTATIS|4.0|This is one of the most unusual movies I've ever seen. the sexual implications and actual scenes are not for the faint of heart nor childrens view at all. I like old roman movies and this one is by far the most &#34;out there&#34; and unique that I've ever seen.
B00D2CYU2W|3.0|Michael Douglas and Matt Damon deserve to win awards...the acting was amazing and the life sad to lose such talent at an early age,he made everyone want to listen to the Piano...HBO thank you for doing this!!!

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Well. I am hooked. The characters are well developed and the plot very well thought out. I appreciated the author's style as well.
0744014956|5.0|Awesome guide. In depth and full of screenshots. The hardcover is nice given how much I've needed the guide for this game. If you're going to try to &#34;gold-medal&#34; missions, I'd recommend it.<br /><br />No GTA Online info here, though.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It was a cooler, thought it was the actual game not just a guide, why would I even want this.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|So...on my 4th (yes, 4th...as in I have done this 4 TIMES NOW) reload of Flipboard on FireHD.  WHEN it works...it is great.  You choose what feeds you want - news, blogs, RSS, tumblr, magazines, etc - you arrange your pages and the order of your feeds...then, when you open Flipboard, it populates with the latest \\"stories\\" from those feeds.  The problem is...it has an annoying tendency to flat out DIE.  You know when it happens - Flipboard will freeze, and you cannot select anything.  Eventually, you get the \\"Flipboard has stopped working - wait or close\\" box.  Soon after, when you try to start Flipboard - it will not even start.  You clear the cache, etc...still nothing.  Only cure - remove and reload...and start all over again finding your feeds, and re-establishing your pages.  OK...so...I have done this 4 times now...not sure I will do it again.<br /><br />One more thing...with the latest \\"update\\" - Flipboard now randomly places an ad page...that is actually a link page to open to even more ads.  Not a problem...you can simply flip right past it...except...90 % of the time, the motion you are using to flip pages won't work, and you end up opening the ad.  So, you back out...and try to flip again...and opens again.  Back out...flip...thin time with GREATLY exaggerated flip motion...and finally it continues onto your next page...not a serious problem...but still a pain.<br /><br />IF...and right now, a BIG IF...Flipboard would remain stable, and hold the pages I create...the ad thing is no big deal.  But...I noted this problem with the update that Flipboard pushed that added the ad pages...for over 6 months, it was great.  Then the update...and the ads...and now, fail...fail...fail...maybe it's coincidence...you decide.  Try it...it's free...see how it works.  Be ready for frustration...<br /><br />EDIT - 2 weeks later...it's DEAD...or maybe DOA (dead on Android...Amazon...).  Anyway - Despite my preference for Flipboard...I have given up on it on my FireHD...it repeatedly locks up, and dies...I have gone back to Pulse, which also locks at times, but at least doesn't completely die and require a reload.  I have noticed - there are several feeds I found on Flipboard that are not on Pulse...bummer...<br /><br />EDIT 2 - 1 Dec 2013 - so, for grins and giggles...loaded on my new HDX...set up a 2 page group of feeds...stayed away from blogs...simple news, tech, sports feeds...and almost immediately, problems started.  In middle of a story, ZAP - it would close.  Pages would not flip.  2 feeds - loaded from Flipboard's suggested feeds...simply quit feeding.  Sorry - only gave it 2 days, and dumped it.  Actually...probably should downgrade to 1 star...peatedly locks up, and dies...I have gone back to Pulse, which also locks at times, but at least doesn't completely die and require a reload.

B00B89LZ4C|4.0|Just received my figure a few minutes ago. I bought this directly from Amazon, and as past reviews have stated the packaging was already open and was taped together. This doesn't bother me too much since I'm not a die hard collector. You may have better luck with other vendors however.<br /><br />The figure does not have articulation and has some difficulty standing up. You have to position Heisenberg just right so he stands.The figure has pretty good detail but a few minor flaws. If you are a fan of the show this would be a great piece to have. If you are a die hard collector who pays attention to detail this may or may not be the figure for you.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|It is everything they promise, 3D is not overdone.  Arrived ahead of schedule in great condition.  Even if you don't entirely agree with J.J. Abrams treatment of Star Trek it is still a good movie to have in your collection.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read his other 2 books which I loved, however, this one seemed to be so similar that I don't think I would read him again. He jumped from past to present in a way that felt very disorganized.  I have enjoyed books in the past that go between the present and past, but it was seamless.  If this is the first time you read this author then I am sure you would enjoy the book.  The characters remind me of other characters in his previous books only with different names.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Entertaining, but not as good as the first two. Robert Downey Jr is the best thing about the movie. Iron man is one of Marvel's best characters, surely they could have used a better story line.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I give this book a rating of 4.5 stars because it has a lot of action and I like action. I didn't give it the full 5 stars because in some parts I got confused. But over all I like both matched and crossed...I'm going to start reading reached now!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was a little concerned because others have complained that the chromecast either does not work with ATT U-verse or requires that UPNP be turned on. I had no such problem. It worked right out the box. I hooked it up to my TV and used my U-verse cable box to provide power through the USB plug. Both Netflix and Youtube worked perfectly. The Cromecast does get quite warm but the instructions tell you it does and that apparently is normal.<br /><br />I might buy another Chromecast so I can have one on each of my TV's.

B00C5R8364|4.0|The Kill List is a good,quick read in the unique story telling style of Frederick Forsyth. The story is up to date and relevant to present circumstances. The author captures the intense irrational hate of the jihadists that will eventually be their downfall.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|This has been a release long-awaited by Dead fans since who knows when, and rightly so. This kind of Final Acid Test finds The Grateful Dead at the top of their game. After an unbelievable tour in Europe that same year, they managed to offer the same level of musicianship in their country during the rest of the year. Luckily, many of those shows were recorded by Bear in great sounding 2-track reels and, to make matters more interesting, this particular show in Veneta was recorded in 16-track, just like the legendary Europe tapes. This open-air benefit show, played under a scorching sun, was one of the peak moments of the year for the band. Every member of the ensemble simply shines, but without overshadowing the rest. Outstanding performances of \\"China Cat Sunflower->I Know You Rider\\", \\"Playing In The Band\\", \\"Bird Song\\" and \\"Dark Star\\" prove the point. I consider these tunes the highlights, but I must point out that the rest of the show is truly great and beatifully executed. The band sounds tight and relaxed at the same time, rehearsed but spontaneous. Unfortunately, Pigpen had already left the band because of health issues, so his songs and his Hammond touches are missed.<br />The mixig job by Jeffrey Norman is excellent, as well as the package. I ordered the 3CD+BluRay edition from Dead.net, which includes an extra booklet, but that, as you might guess, it not the key element of the set. The film is really interesting and well-produced. I was expecting endless shots of naked hippies doing their usual terpsichorean movements, but the camera crew provides us with a beatiful variety of close-ups of the band in action, and different angle shots (even the always elusive Keith Godchaux appears on the screen a couple of times). The 5.1 mix, though a bit weak in the bottom end department, is really, but really good: the listener will find himself in the middle of the band, and will appreciate the most little details, especially during the mind-blowing half-an-hour \\"Dark Star\\" performance.<br />One of the most satisfying Dead releases ever.Star\\" performance.<br />One of the most satisfying Dead releases ever.
B009NYU1CQ|4.0|\\"Forces of Nature\\" is far from compelling as a movie and at times is rather farfetched. The movie begins with Ben (Ben Affleck) and Sarah (Sandra Bullock) inadvertently winding up as traveling companions from New York to Savannah after the plane they're on skids off the runway. Along the way they run into all sorts of difficulties. Among other things, they lose their cash, and Ben has to do a striptease in a gay bar to raise the money for them to reach their destination. (One would have thought that two upper middle class people would have credit cards with them. And certainly they could have gotten someone to wire them money, if necessary. But that wouldn't have been good for a cheap laugh.) Then there's the segment when they're on a tour bus filled with senior citizens, although there's no really good reason why they couldn't have found a more conventional mode of transportation. And, of course, they become emotionally (though not physically) involved, despite the fact that Ben is going to Savannah for his wedding to Bridget (Maura Tierney), which, by the time he and Sarah arrive in Savannah, we're sure he'll call off.<br /><br />The movie is partially redeemed by the excellent acting on the part of Affleck and Bullock. And it is lighthearted and makes for easy watching, which helps, so long as you can get past the implausibilities along the way.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Brad Pitt is, well, Brad Pitt and he delivers a solid performance here but he has no support in either fellow actors or story line. The zombie bit had no new twists, there wasn't any development of Pitts character, and after hopping from scene to scene for 2 hours getting to the end was as much relief as disappointment.

B0000067L2|3.0|Some really great songs. However there are also some not so good songs too. On a couple of the not so goods it was like the band was &#34;goofing&#34; on the listener to see what they could get away with. I guess it came with the times. Pot luck here.
B000001ES4|3.0|The style of music fluctuated w/in the cd. I prefer one style of music on any given cd. When I listen on Pandora and then buy a cd......I want it all to sound similar.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|Not that I expect the album to be the same as a previous album, or the band to never evolve, but I recall that on War Is the Answer, and American Capitalist I was able to listen to them from beginning to end and felt that every song was awesome. With this album, not so much. I just hope that maybe it's like the GNR Use Your Illusion albums and the 2nd volume will end up being amazing and help make the first one more valuable.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I used this in my classroom for when we did folk tales....The kids loved it!!!!!!! I compared it to The Empror's New Clothes stories
B007704PRU|5.0|this ulternate reality really has you thinking. the three main characters are completely relatable and loveable and i cant get enough
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|I remember reading about Nikki Lauda's accident, and that news conference where he came back so quickly, his burns not quite healed, to try to win the Formula One championship in 1976.  I remember reading about that final race where he quit the race because of the horrible conditions.<br /><br />The rest of the story, about James Hunt, I didn't know, and this is a terrific movie, which brings alive the two characters, as well as the women in their lives.<br /><br />A wonderful story, typical Ron Howard-Brian Grazer high quality stuff, a very, very well made movie with heart and soul and well developed characters that you care about, a movie well worth re-watching.  Even the real Nikki Lauda liked it.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for. A compact flash that does not over load the camera in weight sand does the job.<br />Thanks<br />Jeff
B008JFUO72|5.0|I know have the entire series.  I enjoy these types of movies and would recommend this for the excitement to everyone.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Totally love this series. Cassandra can do no wrong. She writes so well and so detailed and the plot is just amazing!
B004KZOXJA|5.0|everybody loves a good forbidden love story and this is it to the extreme. Not just forbidden but taken away from people never to return. ulternate reality thats to die for
B005LAIIGW|3.0|Fantastic movie for space buffs, great 3D visuals, all ruined by having to endure watching Sandra Bullock panic, hyperventilate, and mope for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Yes, endure.  Sandra Bullock, are you listening?  You have personally set back, by about 50 years, the cause of women in space and women as heroic figures in cinema.  Where was Sigourney Weaver's Ripley fighting off monsters here?  Linda Hamilton kicking Terminator butt?  Scarlett Johansson with her cool Black Widow?<br /><br />I wanted to reach out and shake Bullock and scream - STOP USING UP YOUR OXYGEN!  Stop wasting time moping and panicking!  Get going and save yourself!<br /><br />Clooney's calm, aw shucks, Mr. Cool Right Stuff character only served to highlight the sheer inanity of Bullock's character.<br /><br />Portraying a real woman here?  God, I hope not.  Surely NASA selects better quality, more mentally stable, and less emotional women as their astronauts and mission specialists.<br /><br />Or maybe not.  There was of course, the sad case of Lisa Nowak, arrested for attempted kidnapping in a catfight with another woman over a studly male astronaut.  Maybe that was her being portrayed up there in space.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|I loved Goldfrapp's album Seventh Tree and if you loved that album, you'll love this one too. As a person who owns every Goldrapp album, I would with out a doubt say that this is one of their best albums. If you strictly like them (Golfrapp) for their Dance/Electronica sound then I would not recommend this album. If you are a die hard Goldfrapp fan this is a must buy.
B001V9LPY4|5.0|This is probably Hayao Miyazaki finest work so why is not available on Blu-Ray? Other lesser works have found their way to the new format so what are they waiting for? Please remaster it as soon as posible.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really like this game. Pretty good strategy required yet will be easy enough for the kids. I was not disappointed.
B00A4YZWN2|5.0|this book realy hits home with its honesty and the idea that in the real world not everybody can live happily ever after. The way Oliver has concluded this epic series will have you turning pages faster than you can read them
B0027VTMAE|4.0|It's always nice to see Frank Langella on screen. And even if, like me, you're not usually a Johnny Depp fan you might enjoy his understated performance here. European location filming is wonderful, as are the character actors. Plot is more interesting than usual for the genre (bookish hunk caught up in semi-supernatural treasure hunting). CAUTION POSSIBLE SPOILERS: Not having read it I can't say how true to the novel the last seconds of the movie are. But in the movie, it seemed as if the filmmakers suddenly couldn't figure out what they were trying to say. Follow the light? Might watch it again just for the gorgeous scenery and locations.
0884271536|4.0|The story and the idea within it are both fascinating. Although it concentrates on the field of business, it doesn't bore me at all.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|The good:  a whole movie dedicated to the question, &#34;what if the boy who never wanted to grow up, did?&#34;  Robin Williams is great in this film -- from serious lawyer to a man rediscovering his carefree past, it's a good performance.  However, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook really steals the show; a great blend of quirky and slightly neurotic with enough sinister overtones to make him really fit the role well.  I'd definitely give a nod to Bob Hoskins as the first mate Smee -- a rather good performance.<br /><br />I liked the creative license the movie took -- not all of it worked well, but I applaud the effort and results. Some of the effects are rather dated now, but believable enough to not ruin scenes.<br /><br />The bad:  unavoidably campy tones and scenes.  It's a kids movie.  Those above the age of maybe 12 or so might have a hard time enjoying this one unless you're revisiting this for nostalgia.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I rate this book five stars. It is one of the few novellas that did not let me wishing for a bigger book, and yet satisfied me completely.<br /><br />I don't know why people read books. I read books to be awed, to be entertained, to be challenged, to be guided to a different world. What takes from this experience is unreasonable characters, unbelievable situations or story, and sometimes, bad prose. I have been happy with Sanderson books based on these preferences.<br /><br />But this novella is a gem. The questions raised by this book were interesting to me. Is a good forger as good as the original artist, if people cant tell them apart? And if the forger creates a masterpiece, in someone else style? What is art? BTW, look at schools of art: there are fads in the art world, and we all stand in the shoulder of giants. So in my opinion, forgery can be art. Shai's forgery is art for sure, because it goes beyond. I wonder how some of the characters could confuse the two of them.<br /><br />A complex system of magic, yet explained in pratice, as Shai uses it. At least two (three?) deep characters. A good pace, for a story about an imprisioned character.  I think fantasy readers will love it, but friends with open minds will profit from it as well.<br /><br />So this is a novella about artists, its pride, craft, and it is fun. Worldbuiding is not not very deep, but it is sooo satisfying, it really transports you. Flaws? Why should I look for them, if I liked the book? (That is the dilemma of the reviewer: if you look for flaws, you will find them. So if none comes to mind, I will leave it so).
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Good times and fun for all, kids love the movie, have watched it a dozen times or more. Would watch
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful account of the days leading up to World War One. I have not researched its content for historical accuracy but believe it to be a truthful account. Love all the characters; even the ones to be hated!
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Really enjoy this game.  Lots of fun to play.  Total bathroom break must-have.  Got to watch my real driving though.
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|This kept me busy for several hours. I don't yet know how much will need to be purchased to play, so far only purchased rubies for$1.99. Challenging and a bit of a learning curve but that's what makes it fun.
0679805273|5.0|Bought this book for my son who started Kinder last year. I had his Kinder teacher sign & I intend to have all his teachers sign & give it to him at his graduation. I received this book at my graduation & I still have it. Such a special book.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|hard to move,<br />hard to see,<br />would freeze up and not restart.<br />did not like the game and trial is too short
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's fun. The challenge is to keep raising your level to more and more difficult designs. However, after a while I get bored.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game it is free and has no problems you should get it take my opinion!!!<br />:)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved revisiting what kind still believe to be the scariest storyline ever. Well written, riveting from page on and just a fun read.
B0053O89KG|5.0|If you have gotten sucked into this series, and I have, this was the simplest way to try to follow how the relationship between Castle and Beckett develops after season three. We also got Season Five to get us between this product and the current season.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My son loves this movie he watches over and over and for the price its perfect and it came right away
1937986039|5.0|I usually don't like this sort of books for the reason of being \\"glorified manual\\".  But the thing is that original fuji manual for X10 is just horrible.  For example it (fuji manual) doesn't explain how to save setting in say C1 (custom setting).  Page 27 refers to page 87 and that one back to 27.  There is simply no answer as to how save something in C1 setting.  The Glorified manual however has this information and I am sure I does include some more none explained, or  mixed up info of original manual.  I would buy it just for this reason.  I bought my version for around 10 dollars for my Ipad.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I love this game not just because you can play on the go, but also that you can take your time and there's strategy to.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Does its job. Its a cable.  You really want that many words to recommend a cable. Four more words now
B004CS7R70|5.0|I like to watch Texas holdem poker, but I could not see the small print they put in the odds box.<br />With these glasses, I can see the odds box perfectly. Be aware you must be at least 10 ft from<br />the object you are viewing. Luckily both of my TV's are 10ft or more from my viewing position.<br /> Useful item, best price.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|All the Bond Movie theme songs have been digitally cleaned for<br />a great collection!  Must have for any Bond fan.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|A great product from google with a new idea that is worth trying i'm getting this device to connect it to my TV and try things out!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is the best book ever no doubt<br />Definitely better than the harry potter books no challenge what so ever
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I wasn't a fan of Gone Girl so was a bit hesitant to pick up Sharp Objects, but was so happy I did. A definite page turner, couldn't put it down.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Our Chromecaster is named Chester.  Yes, you do get to name it.  So far he works great with Netflix.  The only disappointment so far is the lack of Amazon Instant Prime streaming.  Come on Amazon, get busy and release an app for this thing.
1439190976|3.0|I learned a lot of small things about McKinsey about this book: the early history of the firm, personalities of some Managing Directors,  numbers on revenue growth, a little bit about recent scandals, and lots about the firm's consultants' high regard for themselves.<br /><br />But what I was hoping to learn, and didn't, was what McKinsey actually DOES. The book listed different client engagements, and provided brief descriptions of what was accomplished (recommended cutting costs, revamping organizational structures, etc.).  But there was no substantive discussion  of how McKinsey uses its expertise and accumulated knowledge  to acquire information, analyze it, and translate it into recommendations that clients value (or don't).  Several hundred pages later, McKinsey's success remains as much a mystery to me as it was before.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I couldn't put it down. I often wonder what happened to some of the characters in King's stories but oddly enough Danny Torrance was not one of them. However, I am so glad that Mr. King decided to revisit this character. I couldn't stop reading it. There were a couple of surprises and I even cheered at one point. Abra was a wonderful protagonist. I only have a couple of complaints which is why I didn't give it a 5. First of all, I thought the villains were somewhat underdeveloped. I would have loved to know more about how Rose came to be Rose the Hat. Secondly, I thought that Dick Halloran's character did not get the treatment he deserved from Danny. It was out of character considering everything Dick and Danny meant to each other. Other than that, it was an overall thoroughly enjoyable story!
0470570954|5.0|This textbook is excellent. Using it for an undergraduate Biochemistry class it seems like a very dense reading(as I am doing). At the same time it goes into enough detail of concepts in a Postgraduate sense. I recommend this textbook for any Biochemistry undergraduate students, as well as Graduate students.<br /><br />It doesn't waste space going over Organic Mechanisms, so if those are something you struggle in, you might need to find another textbook to help out with this one.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|I was excited to watch this as I had enjoyed the first two.  But, right from the start there were completely unbelievable scenes to the point of annoyance and I found I was bored. It was definitely way too long. Not sure I'd watch again. They always make just one too many...
B00B22ASUM|3.0|Somewhat enjoyable. Fairly repetitive.  Nice story but didn't really compel me to continue reading. I have a friend that just loved this book.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wonderful first timer.  This was a well written book, very engaging characters and plot line.  I am anxiously awaiting the next one but hey! don't be rushed, way good writing.
B0077QS9C6|5.0|Great movie about one of the greatest F1 drivers to grace the circuit. Amazing use of 1980's video and film footage.
B00112C4EG|3.0|Purchased this cow along with several other items for my Great grandsons farm. He is 2. He enjoys playing with them and it can keep him occupied. Can't ask for much more then that. He has tossed it a few times without breaking so that's a plus.
0425263908|5.0|Very believable story line, well written, and keeps your attention!  Enjoyed so much I read all 3 in a week!
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this movie! It was my favorite Disney movie growing up, and now my daughter loves it, too!!
B005SS2QXS|4.0|This was just the case I was looking for. It's not too slippery and not too sticky. Fits well at first, but eventually seems to stretch out and your phone slides down, partially obscuring the front-facing camera. Not a huge deal, but I get tired of pushing the phone back up.<br /><br />I got this case because it doesn't squeeze the front of the screen messing up the screen protector. It also seems to provide pretty decent protection to the phone.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|The only reason it isn't 5 stars is the fonts, icons and roads need to be a little larger. Hard to see while driving. And second, only on the Android version, the speed indicator is covered over by the alert tab in the lower right. I no longer use a Tom-Tom or Garmin in either car. This app successfully routed me around 2 accidents in D.C. on the way home, both times using side roads and then rejoining 395.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game!! I love hidden object games and this one has proven to be very challenging. Definitely keeps me on my toes trying to find all the items before the time runs out. Love it!!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|While I highly enjoyed The Maze Runner series, it was hard to get into this book. It didn't have the same twists the other books did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you love temple run you will love this game this all most the same but your running from a cop for spray painting
B00DU73T08|5.0|After reading the book, this is definitely a movie worth watching!! I loved it! The movie had great quality, and all the actors fit the parts almost perfectly.
B00E0PT0FC|5.0|This is a recording of master musicians.  I'm particularly impressed with Harland on drums and Eubanks.  I saw this quartet last Friday in Phoenix.  I knew Eubanks from the Tonight show (which I never watch), but in concert he blew me away.  Holland and Harland were shaking their heads in disbelief at the technique and surprises that Eubanks offered.  One of the best guitarists I've seen live.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I only started watching this series as the final season was broadcast on AMC and they ran the show from the beginning over 5 days.  I'd DVR'd it.  By the time I started to watch, some of the shows from Season 2 started &#34;dropping off&#34; my recorder ... ergo, my renting it from Amazon.<br /><br />I love it when you can watch a series beginning to end; find it to be a really good show; and I didn't have to wait for the next season to come out!  Doesn't happen too often ( I recall finding the TV program LOST in this manner ..accidentally).  Rock on!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie was so much better than I expected it to be. Would watch it again and probably purchase it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very interesting premise and well done tale. I enjoyed having the wool slowly pulled from over my eyes as the story unraveled!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I managed to get it working on a Windows 8 laptop w/o problem<br /><br />But when I tried with a Samsung Tab2, Amazon Kindle Fire HD and an Android LG smartphone, the Google playstore seemed to check location (Montreal, Canada) and did not allow the installation.  It is weird that Google and Amazon go to this extreme.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|accidentally tripped up on this as AMC was running the show from beginning the week the series finale showed.  Great sleeper find.
0881889148|5.0|It's The Beatles. What else does anyone need to say? It's the charts to EVERYTHING from J to Y. Peace.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|It was a fun read, intriguing but predictable at the end. Almost seem to combine story lines from Twilight, Hunger Games and Harry Potter.
0425263916|5.0|LOVED this book. It was a great read and I could not wait to start reading Entwined with You. The plot was well developed and I could not predict the end, until the end!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The author writes about 3 different couples whom know each other in some kind of way. Very well written and I highly suggest anyone to read it!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Again, I didn't think I'd like Peter Weller as Batman, but I was happy to be proven wrong.  Joker was vindictive and crazy, but not as insane at the Joker in the cartoon series, and maybe the Joker in the games.  (I haven't played them.)  He wasn't Jack Nicholson's or Heath Ledger's Joker.  He's far more calculating, smooth, and dangerous, but not as nonsensically nuts as the other renditions.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The effects were fabulous, love Morgan Freeman and his character. The woman who played his real wife is so lovable simple and sincere. An interesting and most plausible storyline.
0425263908|4.0|This book starts out sounding similar to Fifty Shades of Grey (which I love by the way) but then picks up speed and changes. I enjoyed reading this book and was very anxious to move on to the next page. Great book, enjoyed reading it!
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|This series was great, both for its writing and basis in Greek mythology and Greek gods in the modern world.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I didn't think I'd like Peter Weller as the voice of Batman, but I was pleasantly wrong.  The gang seemed like a weak enemy, but it worked in the long run.  You just have to remember that this is the first in a 2 part movie.  :-)
B001XUPGLY|5.0|It's legendary and beats ever wannabe copy ever made from the &#34;new&#34; star trek to the stargates and all those others. Love it, these characters are like family to be.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Time off my life that I'll never get back. So glad I didn't go to the movies for this one.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Things get stored, very functional and easy to use. Can only say the best about it! I recommend it certainly
1476727651|5.0|Absolutely Fantastic! I couldn't turn off my Kindle in my hurry to get to the end. This sequel is more than worthy of the original. I really cared about the characters. Now if Mr. King would just follow up on what Stu Redman and Frannie are up to...;->
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Honestly....any story that I want to read again is automatically going to get 4 stars. What earned this story a 5 star review was the remarkable foreshadowing of what things have transpired over the last thirty years. I wish that I would have found this story in paper form when I was a teenager. I would have appreciated more seeing how much this story has affected many movies and such in the years since it was released.  I actually only read this because I bought the movie. I haven't watched the movie yet...we will see.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book had none of the fire the first two had. Plus I'm sick of Eva not fighting back. Eva should be able to have a mind of her own and not just be a pin cushion every time Gideon wants to keep her from having an opinion. I am very disappointed in this book. Sylvia makes every woman look weak and trashy in this series. Not to mention the horrible ending. Just a money grab for the author and publisher:(
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Can download my favorites and listen to it offline..... I love it and think you might too. Haven't had any problems with it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love all the finder games and the puzzle games are really challenging too. A great game for all to enjoy.
B00C1BV9Z6|4.0|So much fun watching this classic with our nine year old son. The animatronics are still amazing after all these years.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The series includes a character for everyone.  Its powerful, sexy, funny and intense at the same time! Can't stop watching. Harvey is soooo yummy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Really like this book.  Couldn't put it down. Was nice to read again about past characters and what became of them. Keep writing please!
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|I recently purchased a 17 inch (Mid 2009) MacBook Pro from Amazon and wanted a number pad to got with it.  The nice reviews sold me on this one.  It paired easily with my MacBook Pro and it works flawlessly.  I can easily recommend this keypad to others.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Fantastic action, plot twist and not your run of the mill movie. Dont worry that the trailer showed the entire thing before it barely scratched the surface. You wont be disappointed.
B005544V6A|5.0|The writer's have made this series to include just enough information in each show to keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's a perfect match of power and everyday adventures, not to mention a peek at what life is like in the big city.  Brilliant!
159562015X|3.0|If you are have maybe just lost your job or are facing a huge turning point in you life, maybe this would be good. Some things, like jobs and giftedness you just have to go out and try.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This was an eye opener on the relationship between ex presidents. Very interesting. I wish they could have done more about the current president and how<br />His ego deals with others who really know the job. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in history.
B008MEM24S|2.0|My granddaughter wanted to play the game on Sat.and we couldn't get it to work, and we wasn't next to a computer.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|When a server crashes twice in one week after crashing the week before, it's kind of hard to play a game. If they would fix it right away it would be cool, but they leave it for days before doing anything about it.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|Very suspenseful with many twists and turns...good writing and fine acting (except for Jude Law's calumnous female law partner who was viciously mean beyond reason). Mara continues to improve with experience.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It is very useful but tends to glitch because sometimes it doesn't want to play a video or download a song.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|LOVE the game, spent considerable money reached level 61 got new device and it didn't transfer. Had to start over. Will not be spending any money this time!!!! If you log into Facebook it should be able to keep it. Lots of others games do, they need to get with the program.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The Wheel of Time may be one of the great sagas ever written. There are many series written with a single hero , but they are usually stand-alone stories with a loose connection. There are series about the generations of a family. The Iliad is a magnificent poem that has captivated millions for thousands of years. The Wheel of Time is different from all of these simply because of its scope.<br /><br />There are fourteen novels in the series, each of which is nearly a thousand pages long. At the same time, there is a clear, logical scope to the series, with a definite goal . Each book is like a chapter that flows from the previous ones and requires the reader to take the next step. The characters are clear and well-developed, with lots of heroes and heroines, villains aplenty and lots of adventure and emotion.<br /><br />Go ahead and read  the first book. You won't be bored. For a long, long time!<br /><br />.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent book! Keeps you wanting more......can't wait for the next one and to see the fate of many. I began reading the series about a month ago and wasn't sure I liked it until I got half way through the first book.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This app provides straightforward access to a broad range of financial data, news and analysis.  Setting up your own portfolio for tracking is quick and provides more data, including graphs, than an investor should obsess over, but it' all there and presented very well.
B008D28HYS|2.0|Maybe it's me, maybe it was the day I got it, but it just seemed boring to me. I'd never heard of it and like puzzkes so I thought I would try it. Yeah... I played a few games and then uninstalled it. It worked okay, but to me, it was a waste of time. U'm sure glad I got it when it was free.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love smallville, it is one of the best television shows ever! Anyone who dosen't like this has something wrong with them.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I find the book a bit confusing the way it goes back and forth and It was predictable about infidellity on somebodies part so I guess we will see how it goes
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game has wonderful graphics and requires the player to think fast for the best moves. It takes practice, but is super fun!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Excellent game and the app runs smoothly. I love playing Mahjong and this version is a good one. Multiple styles and it works well. Because the games are quick (and yes I usually win) it's a perfect one for waiting in the doctor's office.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I quite enjoyed playing this until the last few chapters then it was as though they had ran out of ideas and became repetative so I became bored with it and couldn't wait to get to the end. But even that was thwarted because I couldn't get chapter 16 to do anything except say loading.<br />So I thought I'll finish it on my phone and I got all the way to chapter 16 again and it made an attempt to start but then went no further.  I restarted it and what happened, you probably guessed it just kept saying loading.<br /><br />Maybe you will be luckier than me but I've tried it on a tablet and phone and been left wondering how it finishes.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I saw this movie and hoped the book would clear up some confusion that it left me with.  Unfortunately the book was so bad that I didn't make it past the first 100 pages before I decided life is too valuable to waste reading bad books.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Third time that I have watched all of the seasons. Great show. I would recommend this to everyone. Really intense
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I enjoyed the thought provokng challenges to complete each step of the game. Well tought out and executed graphics and it was fun. I was disappointed that there was only one over all game to solve. True there were multiple levels, but being a &#34;full&#34; version I would think it would be larger and give several games. It doesn't. The multi levels are timed and on one level I had to make two attemps before I completed it. I did enjoy it but just wished there were more.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Device appears to work well nice volume levels big display cheap app ans you can't beat always having an extra alarm handy if power goes out
1476727651|5.0|Another 5 star for Stephen King and redemption of sorts for the crappy Shining film. King is really on fire now ( not that he ever wasn't) with his writing on 11/23/63, Joyland and even Under the Dome. His characters are more lifelike and interesting and his narrative is imaginative and moves. I'd rank this in the King written universe as #5 all-time. The Stand, Salem's Lot, 11/23/63, The Shining, Dr. Sleep.<br />Don't ever stop Stephen!
B005GSY23M|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack.  Especially real hero. I play it all the time.  My downstairs neighbor probably hates it by now...oh well ;)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read! I couldn't buy Shift fast enough when I finished reading Wool. I'm hooked.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|A great Zombie movie with a lot of action. Shows &#34;zombie&#34;origin story better then most. Also the depiction of Zombies was very realistic!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think this is a great game. Gets your mind thinking but not so hard you can't figure it out.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Can't stop watching this series and never heard of it so 100's of episodes! This seems to get more involved episode to episode. It is well made and you need to pay attention so you can follow the story line. Something to look forward to when nothing else in on because it is always available.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|I have heard them referred to as a garage band by a couple of critics. The new album elevates them to a new level.
B0086449YA|5.0|Perhaps Mark's greatest effort yet.  Blends mellow ballads with get up and rock around the room tunes full of high powered energy.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love it, now that it works. Had a terrible time getting printer and notebook to work (recognize) each other. I am still having problems with some printing. It would be nice to have more and better wtitten instruction for set-up and use. Belong to Best Buy Geek Squad/they couldn't help! A friend helped me figure most of it out. Need a deeper understanding on how to take something off net to printer!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Absolutely one of the most entertaining shows we've watched. In fact we watched it three times in the same week. One of the best additions to our library.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book, strange start but once you figure out how all the characters have something to do with each other it's quite interesting .
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|There was a lot of hype about this movie so I really though it would be a lot better then it was. It was a cute movie I think I just had higher expectations for it!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have tried many dictioaries on line, looking for one that is simple to navigate. This one has a place for me to type in the word, then give me defination, and uses, and history. I was sick of trying to get to a word page by page!
B009KG7EMC|4.0|We watched this first as a rental. My husband liked enough that I bought it for him. He has watched it again and will probably watch it again sometime. A good addition to you library.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are incredibly sexy yet they have an amazing story and plot. I'm truly amazed at how good these books -are. Can't wait for the movie. Not happy about the actress they picked to play Ana though.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|My all time favorite Brad Pitt movie is Seven.  He was young and the story line was good and suspenseful.  But World War Z was a good movie.  It had a decent story line - I cannot believe they brought Israel into the plot - but they did.  Thank God we will never have to deal with walking dead people that want to eat us.  Well maybe in the tribulation - but I pray I won't be here to worry about that.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Don't know what I would do if I could not download books, games, supplies, etc. One minute you are wishing and the next, there it is in front of you! Amazon is honorable in their business ethics. No problem too big or too small to solve. I love to work with them and do almost all transactions through Amazon!
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|He read it once as a borrowed book. Liked it so well he asked me to get one for him to keep. He has read it a couple of times, which is his habit when he really likes what he reads. Good book
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't stop at 1 have to read them all. These books amazingly have an awesome story line. Good reading. Recommended.
B0027Z5DM6|5.0|Great fun and has a good message.  Recommend  to watch.  Great acting from everyone and I was surprised to see so many great actors.
B002XZOZQA|3.0|The music is timeless and fun, the choreography excellent, but the live play is better.  The finale is still a show stopper!
B005D63ICI|2.0|Julia Stiles' acting is so amateurish--like watching a bad high school play. The Lumen story line is tedious. I skipped to next season.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are incredibly sexy yet they have an amazing story and plot. I'm truly amazed at how good these books -are. Can't wait for the movie. Not happy about the actress they picked to play Ana though.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Loved this,movie!  Authentic depiction of Elizabethan England, great performances, humor, love.  Ver cleverly written, as young Shakespeare experiences some of the situations as his newest character, Romeo.  Ending was moving and satisfying.  Highly recommend!
B00336G7HI|5.0|Useful
B004X6PRO6|5.0|An absolute triumph in story telling. I was gripped and moved by practically every page.<br /><br />What an eye opener this book was for me. Amazing example of human perseverance and cruelty.<br /><br />My compliments to the author! If you are considering reading this book, don't hesitate! Buy it and love it!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great acting and chilling recap of a disaster that no one could imagine and hopefully will not occur on that scale ever again.  I true tale of determination and reaching out to take care of the human spirit.  I recommend this for all to see!
B000002HO3|4.0|Many hits here enjoyable. Do I remember them i waited as each track started.<br />Then members of my family started singing their hits.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Bryan Cranston and company deliver some of the best acting in this season. The stakes are higher and the storyline is addictively gripping. Like the antihero's product, you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I first saw this as a teen. This was one of my first Halloween favorites and remains on the top of my list today!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I love this app but lately its not been letting me log in ..it says its having trouble logging in try again in a bit and I do and still nothing ....please fix this app!
B001EC2IV2|4.0|Very suspense movie and what great action scene. there are scene that make you think of what our government might be up to no good.
0316204366|5.0|When is an advantage actually a disadvantage? What about vice-versa?<br /><br />The world is much less black and white that it may seem. Informative, if at times disturbing because of the brutality of a few of the stories. I didn't like this book as much as Outliers, but I blew threw it and learned a great deal.<br /><br />A note to readers: Don't ignore the footnotes. They're very insightful.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Valentina is first rate in every way. Great passion, heart, and awesome technique. She shows a deep connection with and understanding of Rachmaninov. Her slavic soul soars to great heights and we get to come along for the ride!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I have the first two Iron Man movies in my collection and I will definitely be adding this one. The graphics are awesome and the plot is action packed. I even like how they kept all of the original actors/actresses.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Here is the Great guitar player David Gilmour of Pink Floyd . Each chord the master plays. Each song I get to enjoy over and over again
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|watched with my daughter. liked the animation idea - like in computer game. Still pretty primitive story. Too much cliche storylines.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|AN EXTREMELY ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF 15TH CENTURY EVENTS DURING THE EARLY CRUSADES. GREAT CAST !!!! VERY SENSITIVE AND POSITIVE MESSAGE !!!!!! EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS FILM !!!!!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think this is a great game you can text your friends and you can send pics and I looks like it is on a iPhone
B001TCHDPS|5.0|How could we all have missed this wonderful man for so long?  A fabulous song writer.  A more fabulous person.  For those who don't know his story, buy and watch the documentary, &#34;Searching for Sugerman&#34;!  Five stars all the way.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After the first two books, this one was just more of the same and a bit boring. It took too long to get to the conclusion.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love to spend time working these out with my daughter.... Great job developers  a great game without the need for premissions...
B006OCM0G0|3.0|got for my granddaughter so I don't play it but she does once in a while, has more she plays more often (she's 6)
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is the album that helped end the hateful regime of South Africa's apartheid state.  Beautiful music with inspiring messages.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The newness has begun to wear off and the adventures of the heroin began to drag a bit. To much time on her emotional state and too little on her actions.
0894803123|5.0|If you love Ben & Jerry's Ice cream, you have to buy this book.  The recipes are soooo easy and you can always add your own ingredients to tweak it &#34;your way&#34;.  A must for home ice cream makers.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I learned so much factual information from this book. I know that devout Christians will vehemently resist any ideas that go against their religious teachings, but some things are just a matter of common sense. As a teacher of the Latin language and ancient Roman culture, I found Dr. Aslan's comment about the Romans not being known for their sense of humor, right on point. I actually laughed out loud because it rang so true. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of Jesus's time, and who has an open mind. It is not for people who believe the Gospels to literally be the words of God.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Great, fast paced action film suitable for young adults.  It did seem a little over the top for a guy who remembers the original TV series.  For example, there are threads that seem to be left hanging and the layout of the NCC 1701 is just a little hard to believe.  The layout resembled something more like the Tardis than the NCC 1701.  But overall, I would highly recommend it!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Really good story line. Great mini games. Loved it, cant wait to play the next one.<br />I love that you can re play with different levels.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I like it. If you like puzzles it is a good game for you. You should try it. Its fun.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I love, love, loved this book.  The characters seemed so real to me, I couldn't put it down.  I hope and pray the author will write a sequel.  I want to find out how there lives continue.  No matter how many sequels she writes it has to have a happy ending.  They just have way too much love for each other to have them end apart.
0425263916|5.0|I loved this trilogy, great characters and wonderful story line.<br />If u loved fifty shades of grey, you'll this story.
0449011909|5.0|For those familiar with, and fans of, the TV series I commend these books to you. I read the first in the series and found the very many characters a little daunting, but since that first volume I have listened to the succeeding volumes on audiobooks.<br /><br />I have to say Roy Dotrice's performance as the reader of the books is spectacular with the range of voices and accents of those voices remarkable. I note that those voices are portrayed somewhat differently from the characters on the TV series so the listener will have to pay attention to follow the characters but it is a well rewarded journey.<br /><br />This book three of the series goes further than the third series of the TV show so those only familiar with the TV series will have to wait for the events that end the book in a succeeding series. I'll say no more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and sailed straight into Volume 4. Loving it.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana is a master storyteller!  She weaves the characters into the heart so that they become real -- at least for the moment.  On a recent trip to Scotland  I actually looked for ruins, graves, etc. relating to the story.  Once you start this series it is hard to let it go.  How can you not read on!
B00555X8OA|5.0|I have always found the Myers Briggs helpful in terms of understanding the way others think/operate.  This is a different approach that is extremely useful and compelling.  I liken it to the Black Swan in terms of insights.  This will help you understand how to better manage your own thought process and how to understand why others make the decisions they do.  I love the reference to a lazy system 2.  It helps us understand how much energy is required to make good decisions.
0062059963|5.0|I loved this trilogy, great characters and wonderful story line.<br />A great story to get lost in and take some time for yourself!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|this game is difficult to get around...from room to room.  There is no help or<br />or tutorial to assist you until you get the hang of it
B0060AY85C|5.0|Where is home? And how do you find it without knowing what it looks like? For a man named Frank Money, finding home was a journey to a distant country, a place where he was hated and hunted, a return to a birth place, where he was negated and unwanted--a place devoid of peace, a nativity fraught with negativity. His place of birth was not his home. The house where he was raised was only wood and floor filled with foul memories.<br /><br />There was Cee, his little sister. She too searched relentlessly for that place of safety and peace, she too unsuccessfully.  The wood and floor for her held hateful words from flesh and blood, no love, no nurturing, no bright outlook. The house held only resentment. So Frank and Cee resorted to running away to the wrong places where hardship waited and death and destruction baited. Their search for home, because of their ignorance of its appearance, resulted unfortunately in their homelessness.<br /><br />Toni Morrison's \\"Home\\" was a deep look into the lives of children left to fend for themselves--children who matured physically and mentally, but not emotionally. Her writing is so entertaining and energetic that you can't help but be enveloped by the story. You sympathize for Frank and Cee. You even feel sympathy for Lenore, the antagonist who lived and breathed hatred. Morrison helps you to even understand her emotions. Unfortunately, you also get to understand why Frank was really so remorseful when he returned from The Korean War.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" deals with damage and redemption, showing readers what can happen when a child isn't shown what home really is.  It encourages me to increasingly create that place of safety and security for my children so they don't have to wander aimlessly to find that place called home. Home is peaceful and loving. It's easy and inspiring.  It's filled with safety and stability, reason and rationality. When my heirs begin settling their own homes, I don't want them to wonder what it looks like, where it should be, and how to find it.  Daddy taught them, with all of his might, that Home was someplace wonderful. Home was someplace right.
B004CES7DM|5.0|Renner's work is great to watch. He knows his craft well keeps on getting better and better. Contains a wonderful story with suspense, action, pathos, and insight.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this trilogy, great characters and wonderful story line.<br />If u loved fifty shades of grey, you'll this story.
B005ETANC2|4.0|Hard to find this movie as it is a 50s Sci-Fi Flick. Good Plot and while Black and Black is dated and color would help it now. They should consider a remake or Sequel?? Hmm
B002MQYOFW|4.0|the first time I read these three books I sprinted through them and didn't really pause to feel all the intricacies and nuances the author was accurately displaying.My second reading has been much slower and more deliberate an  therefore more enjoyable...
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I got duolingo primarily because it was free and we have a Hispanic family next door and I had forgotten almost all the Spanish I learned in college 40 years ago. It's very easy to use and you can practice the same lessons over and over again because the lessons are never quite the same. It adjusts to what you are learning. It's neat that one can also do Spanish to English, which is what I am encouraging my 8 yr old Hispanic neighbor to try. I think that the ability of the app to recognize speech is positively amazing. I try to do some practice with the English to spanish every day. My only problem is that I don't know how to add accents to the letters on the kindle, so the app keeps reminding me that I've missed it.
0425263924|5.0|I loved this trilogy, great characters and wonderful story line.<br />If u loved fifty shades of grey, you'll this story.
B0001BDAQO|5.0|Yes phenomenal, superb, papa bach would like it I think.  I couldn't believe the separation of the instruments and perfect mix from this SACD.  A very nice selection of Loussier's early Play Bach stuff, mostly my faves too.  For those new to Jacques, you should check him out on DVD live (there are some previews on youtube), there are several nice performances available including the Bach celebration with Bobby McFerrin a few years back.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Very fun runner game similar to something like lame castle plus more fun parts. Would recommend for anyone. Definitely worth the money. Highly recommend for kids or adults.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I learned about the political atmosphere of the time. Loved and hated his characters. Rejoiced when the bad guys get their just desserts. Couldn't put the  book down even when the story line pissed me off!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This is the best show on TV. I expect that Elena and Stefan back together and Damon back with Katherine.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great- my kindle works again! I thought it was broken but it was the cable that was broken.the customer service was the best
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book so many times,  Travis is my dream guy but too bad he's not real damn!the bike and the underground fighting make him ten times hotter and let's not forget those gorgeous tattoos yummy. This book was so darn sexy!!! you have to read this you'll not regret it!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a life long fan of Stephen King. Next to The Stand, The Shining is my favorite horror novel of all time. When I heard he was doing a sequel, I was beside myself with excitement. But I was also scared that he wouldn't be able to pull it off. How could he, after all? But from the opening pages of Doctor Sleep where we find Danny and Wendy staying with Dick Halloran shortly after the climax of The Shining, I found myself absolutely mesmerized. The book is is not perfect-- there were a few notes that fell a little flat with me-- but as Dan Torrance and the young Abra come together, (literally and figuratively), the novel transcended all of my fears. Outstanding and brilliant.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another Great Book From S.K.  This book is one of his best.  I know this because it kept me up past the witching hour, the only light in the room spilling out from my backlit iPad, everyone else in the house asleep, and me letting out startling gasps every time my husband rolled over in bed (and asking, &#34;Are you still reading that?&#34;).  Every year since I was young I start my Halloween preparatory traditions; buying pumpkins, getting costumes, putting up spooky decorations......and reading only horror novels from September 1st through October 31st.  Stephen King's book (or books) have always been part of this tradition.  Last year, for me, it was &#34;Desperation&#34; and &#34;Needful Things.&#34; This year, &#34;Doctor Sleep.&#34;  I do hope that Mr. King will produce another great one in time for my 2014 Halloween traditions!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Friends have been recommending this series for years and when the annoucement that the star was going to be playing Christian Grey in the new Shades of Grey movie I decieded to check him out. I watched season 1-6 in two weeks. Loved them all!!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I watched the movie years ago and really enjoyed it. The book exceeded all expectations. Well written! This book allows the reader to view the afterlife from an interesting perspective.
B0081336FO|5.0|weird good lol, I really didnt think I was going to like it but its so awesome n the acting is perfection.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The Hyper 212 Plus was the gold standard in CPU coolers and still holds up against more recent offerings. The install can be slightly complicated and the included instructions aren't much help. Installing the CPU cooler requires that you take your time. Looking up additional information on installing the cooler is very helpful. The cooler itself is large compared to any stock cooler you'd encounter. The cooling performance is quite good and there is a very noticeable difference from stock temperatures.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This rating has less to do with the game than with my abilities to be a gamer. I am in my 60's and have never played games but I love Despicable Me so I thought I would try. I am sure the game is fun if you understand what is going on. I am going to have to ask on of my nieces or nephews to show me how to get the most out of this game. I have tried all the options to see if there is an instructions page but can't find it.  If anyone knows where I might find instructions I would be grateful. When I figure this out I will revisit my rating and give it more stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG I absoulutly love its the most fun game ever that's the only reason I got a kindle to play MINECRAFT I LOVE IT EVEN MORE THAN ROSS LYNCH WHO I LOVE
B003JUGQ38|5.0|this is the best season of doctor who,  the &#34;I dont want to go&#34; line will make you cry for sure...
B009NY43NY|4.0|I don't understand why this book has gotten so many bad reviews. I am only giving it 4 stars because there are still some unanswered questions. Such as, there was no specific person that Sookie ended up with. It was hinted at and some people assume who it was, but there was no concrete decision. As in, she agreed to marry or married a specific person and they lived happily ever after, etc... I hope this will be answered in the follow up book.<br /><br />Some people argue that the style of writing was different, but I disagree. I made it a point to re-read some of the previous books to refresh my memory of the style of writing and the characters. The writing style is the same as previous books, and this book was just as entertaining. I feel that the characters behaved the way they would normally have behaved, and stayed true to themselves.<br /><br />I felt the the ending of Eric and Sookie was sad, being a huge Team Eric fan, but in all fairness, it ended well. There were two major issues in this relationship, and I believe they were given a proper discussion. Eric still provided for Sookie to show her his affection for her, and it's clear that they both still love each other on some level. Sometimes love itself is not enough, and that is shown here.<br /><br />Don't judge a book based solely on what bad things other people have said about it. Read it for yourself and judge based on your own opinion. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This book is a good read and Charlaine did a wonderful job of wrapping it up, although, there are some questions that still haven't been answered.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|An outstanding, amazing movie. We don't see why this movie didn't get 5 stars. A lot of people who love the old Wizard of Oz don't like this movie because it's like a remake of the old. It's black and white at the beginning, it has a the flying monkeys, the good and bad witch, the munchkins, etc. It's a movie def for the younger generation and for any Disney fan. It's not a musical like the older one. It is kind of a love story adventure. Very good graphics and you will really fall in love with the characters and their personalities.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So glad this game is on Kindle, it is such a good, and fun game. Keep up the good updates.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I was really disappointed in this book, my daughter had recommended I read it and with a new show based on the book I figured it would be good. I walked away thinking the author just wanted to tell everyone what a great, perfect person she is. Which made her very boring.<br /><br /> Beautiful white woman with great boyfriend and family goes to medium security prison for a year. Everyone loves her and she makes all the other inmates better people. How sweet. I would have loved to hear more about the other inmates, they have a much more interesting story to tell.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|If you love blood, soft porn and good writing you will love this movie.  I think what  happened is that some one wondered if there was a way to put more nudity in this movie and they did.  Do not get me wrong, I love nudity but it just seemed that  they put it in just to put it in.  I do believe that the story was better written and leading up to the suspenseful ending was done very well.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I had read the book prior to the Oscars. The film was well done and the acting was remarkable. Usually, when I read a book first, the movie can be a let down. Not this time. Well done!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every episode has surprises.  I feel as if I know these people. Wardrobes and sets are magnificent.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Quite simply....I loved it. Not as freaky/scary as I had hoped but the story had lots of heart and feeling. Mostly healing for our Danny Boy. And for that I'm glad. Thank you Steve for another great read. Can't wait for the next one sir. Long days and pleasant nights. KM
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great take on a classic duo....<br /><br />The casting for this is fantastic.  I've watched this season twice now and found many little details I missed the first time around.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|Mr Krugman is living in his imaginary Keynesian non-sense... totally a shamed.<br />Please do not waste your time on reading this book.
B003RT0NK8|4.0|Story was ok, but I liked it because it was less fantasy and fiction, more science.  It helped you understand how cold (and sometimes hot!), dark and lonely ultra-deep space would be like. The ending was confusing but to me, this film was about its content and visuals, not so much its plot or conclusion.  Would recommend to any fan of space-Sims and cerebral thrillers that are technically top-notch, ie: 2001, Prometheus, Gravity, etc. Not recommended for something to watch on a date, unless you both enjoy feelings of loneliness, stress and depression.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Kevin Costner does a good job playing his role in my opinion in this dvd.  There definitely is enough bad nasty parts to go around and Maid Marion and Robin Hood are the heroes.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I couldn't stop reading<br />It. And the price is quite fair too. I loved it
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|It is interesting that Sibelius outranked Beethoven and Ravel in popularity back in the 1930's.  When hearing his symphonies, &#34;The Swan of Tuonela,&#34; and &#34;The Bard&#34; you can see why this much overlooked composer was so lauded in his day.  For those who love classical music this collection is a must.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It's not letting me log in it keeps saying this is taking longer then it should pls try again in a bit but it's been Two days now and I love this app so pls try and fix it soon
B00007BKVC|3.0|This movie shows how one crime leads to other crimes and sometimes there is not any return to a  straight future.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Im sure people were wanting a summer Sci-Fi action blockbuster with space battles & explosions.<br />This was more about a kid & his father who had some issues, & the situation that brought the issues to something of a closure.<br />The fact that it happened in our future & a different planet perhaps made people expect different. If it were on an airplane crashed in the dessert, it would have had a different reception.<br /><br />I liked it as is!
1451648537|5.0|Im not an apple fan boy, although my kids like the products. I enjoy Samsung and the freedom of the Android operating system. However, I am very impressed with what Jobs had done. I have worked with clinical narcissists like him before and know firsthand the attention to detail, which is painstaking for those around him. But the end result was nothing short of remarkable.
B001QE9WEO|5.0|I love it I can't think of anything bad to say but keep up the great work I love to see more
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Addicting and good. Love the storyline, more action than I expected, rarely a boring page. I would definitly recommend it
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Very intriguing story.  Love the concept.  Can't wait for the movie.  A great read for all ages. Couldn't put it down.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Good action with a logical storyline. Get the popcorn sit back and enjoy.  Does a good job of incorporating aspects of the book but has fast moving zombies to fill the need of viewers.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome! I love it!!! It is fun for all ages and is fun game to play when u r bored
B007AL48UK|3.0|My second favorite game, lots of different levels for a free game and many more if your in the market to buy it
B004X75RK4|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock have such great chemistry. I can watch it over and over.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|much better than stallone's original. good graphics and art in the slow motion sequences, and just pretty good all the way around
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I really enjoy Michael Connelly's books; I loved THE LINCOLN LAWYER. Perhaps the reason my husband and I felt some disappointment with this book is because we had high expectations that this book didn't fulfill. Yet, I'm glad I read it. So, go ahead and buy it, read it and enjoy it. In fact, you might love it!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was an awesome movie!  As soon as it was over, my husband and I went to see when the second movie was going to be released.  We want to see more!!  Great story line, actors, action, special effects.  A must see.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great series. Not usually a big reader but these books were completely addictive! Couldn't put them down.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This is part of a writer series that tugs your heart.  A lot of emotions run through you when watching this movie.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|This is fun and challenging for me. I don't play games on Facebook so I wish I could skip the part where they ask you to login every time.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Just when you think you know or have heard everything about or by this man, here comes some more timeless material.  It's fascinating to discover the songs he was interpreting during this &#34;down&#34; period of his career, and so effortlessly and with his own unique genius.  Probably deserves 4 and 1/2 stars for a few minor quibbles, but overall I love it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I really like this game but you run out of coins too fast and it takes to long to build them back up. I can see where it could become costly if you wanted to play a longer time.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|What can I say? I am a Riddick fan! Always liked the story, so I am just brushing up in the series before the newest installment comes out. I liked the extras with a bit more back story -Johns journal was cool. Can't wait to watch the animated bridge next.
B004FYZJYE|5.0|Apparently, The Troubled Man, is Henning Mankell's last book in the Kurt Wallander series. Many of us will miss him as we got to like the often grumpy detective, who has had his own, very individual, ways of following suspects and investigating crime(s). This novel is not necessarily his best detective story, - but then I am not the one to judge, not being very knowledgeable in this genre - yet, in other ways, it makes for a very rewarding read. We learn more about the man, Wallander, who he was and what made him the man he is at sixty. We get to understand how he pursues his leads, even when the case is not really his to tackle. In this case there is a family connection that pulls him into the drama head-on. It becomes evident soon that the case will benefit from Wallander's experience and knowledge of Swedish history going back thirty years and more.<br /><br />I found the context explored in the novel rather fascinating, having lived through those times in Europe. In fact, the story led me to recalling the rumours and innuendos about the much admired Prime Minister, Olof Palme, his policies, the arms business, and the Soviet submarines assumed to be in places where they shouldn't have been... and later the mystery of Palme's murder. All those events and more form the backdrop to the personal story and drama.<br /><br />Finally, and movingly, Mankell gives his hero of many years the time to reflect on his life, his loves and losses... and to share his musings about age and whatever life is left for him. The author does that with great empathy and understanding and readers, not only of the older generation, will probably relate to these aspects in personal ways. Some themes may a bit drawn out and not all loose ends come together, but then, neither do they in life. [Friederike Knabe]
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This was a gift , which seems to have made the person happy. I have not considered if I would purchase for myself at this point?
B008Y212PI|5.0|Fun game. Keeps your mind engaged trying to figure out positions of squares. Love it. Lots of fun even when you don't have much time. good de-stresser.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I loved this book. It was fun and light and written in a whimsical style that was a great break from all the noir I've been reading lately! Sophie is a grumpy old woman in a young woman's body...who then turns into an old woman by the evil Witch of the Waste. Enter Wizard Howl, who apparently originates from Wales, and who inhabits a moving castle. The elderly bewitched Sophie ingratiates herself into the Howl household and very slowly you start to see all of the main characters, Sophie, Howl, Michael, the dog-man, and Calcifer the fire demon, start to melt into their true selves. It's a slow reveal of goodness and it's delightful.<br /><br />I wished there were more character development with Sophie's sisters and a bit more explination about the whole Wizard Suliman/Prince Justin thing. Especially as finding Prince Justin seems to be the catalyst for all the action at the end of the book. You don't get a full back story as to why the Witch of the Waste and the King are at odds...other than that she's evil and wants to take over everything. But isn't that always the way?<br /><br />Overall, an immensely enjoyable book with a cowardly Howl to fall in love with.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Re-read this before the movie comes out and its just as powerful as it was when I read it in college.  My only disappointment is in the author's failings in living up to Ender's ability to empathize with his enemy.  If only Orson Scott Card could be one-tenth the hero Ender is, he would be able to see what his religion blinds him to, that same-sex couples are people too, worthy of the same rights and freedoms he enjoys.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love YODA bird, this game is so friggin cute I can't stand it. My kids have been playing it, I can't wait to play it myself.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to exercise the brain. We love playing this together. Our kid likes it too. We highly recommend this for anyone.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|In The Elite, the sequel to Kiera Cass's The Selection, America Singer is still half-heartedly vying for the hand of her country's next leader, the handsome and debonair Prince Maxon Schreave. But unlike Selection, Elite delves a bit deeper into all of the catfights, tangled emotions, and tenuously formed friendships that go on behind the scenes of this nationally televised contest.<br /><br />It's easier for readers to connect with the characters and plot in this book than it was in the first. The dialogue flows better and the love triangle really starts to suck you in. There were a couple of points where I found myself anxiously wondering which guy America would pick, Prince Maxon or Aspen, her first love. There are plenty of questions about who is really a good guy and who might have ulterior motives. I do find it somewhat hard to like America at times and wish that she had a bit more pluck when making decisions. She goes back and forth an awful lot!<br /><br />The odd thing about this series is that it's also supposed to be about a group of rebels versus the kingdom of Illea, and there is a good deal of unrest about the caste system within the kingdom itself. You don't know yet if the rebels are upset about castes or something else entirely. The fighting scenes are vague and the reasons behind the conflict are still unclear by the end of this second book. It's a romance novel with utopia vs. dystopia underpinnings, but the two don't quite mesh together that well.<br /><br />Overall, Elite is an enjoyable novel to read. The writing is good and the love story is engaging. The key is to not take this book too seriously, even though the author tries to make serious comments about today's society (i.e. reality TV, media, status, government, and economic class). Grab it for a fun read on the beach and enjoy a nice YA romance, with a sneak peak into what it might really feel like to be a contestant on \\"The Bachelor.\\"
193700788X|1.0|I gave this book one star only because you don't offer a zero star option. I pre-ordered Dead Ever After as I had the previous Sookie Stackhouse novels with great anticipation. Expecting a great beach book for my vacation. I actually held off starting the finale to this series until I was settled in my beach chair. It didn't take long to realize this was a hastily thrown together mish-mosh disguised as a novel, pity, it was a missed opportunity by the author to give the characters the sendoff  they deserved.I chose not to comment on the plot,because truthfully there really wasn't much of one. I was prompted to write this review now so many months after reading Dead Ever After because Ms. Harris has decided to write a follow up book with illustrations  detailing some of the other characters lives, ever after. No Thanks.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected.  Even though it was a long movie, it managed to hold my attention and keep me interested.

B0089LOKHG|3.0|Requiem by Lauren Oliver is the third book in the Delirium trilogy. I gobble up all things YA and loved the first two books in the series, so was a happy camper when this book finally came out and downloaded onto my Kindle!<br /><br />Let me just say, Lauren Oliver is a great writer. There is a lot of YA fiction out there that is poorly written and none of Oliver's books fall into that category. Requiem is well-written and engaging. The dystopian United States that she paints is believable and the structures of this crumbled world stay the same throughout all three books. The first book, Delirium, totally sucks you in. The characters of Lena and Hana are the classic friend duo, breaking all the rules. When Alex comes into the picture, you root for him and Lena to get together and for the teens to break free of society's mandatory \\"cure.\\" The cure that wipes away the ability to love and keeps everyone in control.<br /><br />The second book, Pandemonium, follows Lena out into the Wilds and Alex to a special hell of a prison. This is where things start to falter a bit. The main characters that you really care about are too split up. Alex is apart from Lena, Lena is apart from Hana and her cousin Grace, and you meet a whole new group of characters in the Wilds, some of whom are immediately killed off. And then enters Julian, the son of the total bad-guy-in-charge, as well as Lena's mother who has been assumed dead.<br /><br />What I, as the reader, wanted out of Requiem was answers and a good wrap up to the stories of all the main characters. The problem is that Oliver has too many threads going and she started a whole new point of view by rolling back to Hana from the first book. I felt like I had lost the character of Alex, he had been gone too long from the story, and so when there was the love triangle between Lena, Alex, and Julian, it felt forced. Especially with the introduction of Alex's new love interest in the Wilds. Then you meet Pippa, the counterpart to Raven, all the while circling back to the supposedly cured Hana, her impending wedding to the new evil mayor, and her connection to Grace, Lena's outcast cousin. Oh yeah, and the whole Lena and her distant mom drama.<br /><br />You sort of lose the story of the fight between the cured and uncured because Oliver tries to go too deep into too many characters. When you have a trilogy, you want to make sure that the main characters are really well developed, their story lines are strong, their voices are well defined, and their actions are at the forefront. Then you can add in a bunch of lesser characters.<br /><br />In addition, you don't really get an end to the whole story. Lena herself says, \\"I don't know what will happen - to me, to Alex and to Julian, to any of us.\\" It's implied that the uncureds will succeed in taking down society, but have little idea how to build it back up. It's also implied that Alex and Lena will get back together, but the reader gets no definite answers.<br /><br />So my conclusion is this: The whole series is entertaining, well-written, and if you love YA, you will enjoy it. Despite Requiem's drawbacks and lack of a concrete conclusion, it does manage to semi-wrap up the story and leave the reader basically satisfied. Compared to a lot of other trilogies out there, this is one of the better ones.en, all the while circling back to the supposedly cured Hana, her impending wedding to the new evil mayor, and her connection to Grace, Lena's outcast cousin.

B00D37UQ1K|4.0|I loved the book, and initially hated the movie...until I decided to separate the two completely.  It is unrealistic to expect a movie, in two hours, to cover the depth of a book that took over 23 hours to listen to on Audiobooks.  The first difference is the characters...some are missing altogether...and most all of them in the movie are nearly exactly the opposite of what they look like in the book!  Most notably, the Seeker!  Movie version is nearly Nordic!  Tall, blonde and always dressed completely in white...in the book she is very short, dark haired and always...ALWAYS...dresses entirely in black!  The same was true for all the main characters...it was almost as though the person who chose the cast purposely chose actors who did not look like the well described characters from the book.  At the end of the story, the &#34;replacement&#34; human Wanda is tiny, ethereal white/blond angelic looking 17 year old girl....in the movie..sort of short, dark haired olive complected &#34;vampish&#34; looking very sexy looking woman.<br />Anyway, once I decided to watch the movie as an entirely different storyline from around the same time in history (like a second book!) and that it was about another &#34;pod&#34; of survivors ...  well, then it has its own merits.  Now, having watched it several times, I can accept it as a continuation of the original idea.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|I used to have this album until it was &#34;stolen&#34; from me.  I could have just bought it again in the UK, however the UK version is missing  and minus some of the best tracks all on here.  The UK presssing does not have Polksalad Annie or Kentucky Rain, both on disk 2.  There are other glaring omissions too but these are my favourites.  Buying an import is not always worth the time and effort, this one is.  There are also many claimed to be best of albums, but I happen to think that with this particular essential, thats exactly what it is.
034580404X|5.0|RATING;  It was great!!!  I am reading it every free minute I have.  I would reccomend it to anyone who loves to read.
B005LAII4E|4.0|I liked it, although hated the loss of major character.  It was different, but good sequel to the original movie.
B008JFUO72|1.0|Even my 11 year old gave up on this. It's time for this franchise, the cost of which could run a small country, to come to a sputtering end. Americans are tired of blow em up juvenilia. We want quality film making - films like The Place Beyond the Pines, Gravity or the host of great HBO shows that have changed our tastes in the direction of story, suspense and drama - not comic books. The film is a disaster that will likely play well in far flung Asian and Indonesian markets where people lead subjugated lives under proto-Communist or terrorist regimes and need a break from their dreary lives.
B00E0SX118|5.0|I never got to see this movie in the theater so it was one I really wanted to have.  This is one of the cutest animated movies I have seen !! My grandson loves being able to watch his movies anywhere !! A must have movie !!  😀👍
076790592X|5.0|I read this book as a senior in high school. It really made me step back and look at my life to realize what's truly important.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|I am a sucker for the Die Hard movies.  This one was a little different, but over the top just like the rest.  I still think the 3rd installment was the best of the bunch.
0399900705|5.0|\\"The Bourne Identity\\" is the first book by Robert Ludlum that spawned the very successful Jason Bourne series, and in my mind it is his best. The novel begins as a half-dead man with his body bloodied and riddled with bullets is dragged from the sea onto trawler in the middle of a storm. Less than three hours earlier he was shot and thrown into the sea by people intent on killing him for reasons he does not know or remember. Their mistake is in believing him to be dead. The man eventually finds himself in Zurich and discovers that his name is Jason Bourne, that he works for a covert company, and that an assassin he does not know is hunting him down.<br /><br />Flashbacks trigger memories as Jason tries to figure out his identity, and in amazing fashion provide him with what he needs to avoid being killed. That is the beauty of this book - it is both a fast-paced, action-packed thriller and the story of a man desperate to find out who he really is - no matter the consequences. Full of suspense and intrigue with a unique twist on character development, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" is without a doubt one of the best thrillers ever written.
B005VPRETE|4.0|Super cute but too difficult for my daughter to do by herself. We put it together as a pair, which was great but she had wanted to take charge and coulnd't.
B002BWP49C|3.0|The product was excellent - but the delivery tracking was not given. You did not know how or the exact date of delivery. For someone living in an upstairs apartment of a secure apartment -- it meant waiting for a period of possibly two weeks to see when the package was being delivered.  They need to use a better system.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Superb! 5 stars without questions. A must have for every fan. Good delivery also. I am new to amazon but I sure commeback for more.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Just a nice collection of fine work from a master of his craft.  The only downside was the first track.  It is a horrible rendition by George when he was a young child.  About 15 seconds was more than enough of this ear piercing juvenile caterwalling.  Other than that (thank God for the skip button), this album is a pleasent interlude and a smooth piece of work.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington does a phenomenal job in this movie. I would recommend this product to others.  It was priced reasonably and arrived quickly.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My whole family loves this game. I like the guiding lines to help you launch your birds where you want them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great u should have a liking of horses though. Is very fun . You compete ride and groom horses
B000NA28I4|3.0|so I finished reading Eragon a month or two ago. Excellent book, I can't wait to read the next one. (I already own all of them). I decided to watch the movie again despite its horrible reviews. (it has been like 7 years, and I didn't really remember it). Anyways, I kinda liked how it started, but then it went really fast trying to cover the story's concept but by leaving a lot of things out. It was a decent movie, I guess. Its a long book, so to really get to the greatness of the book, it could have definitely used another hour to build the relationships better. If you can read and like to read, the book is way better.
B0089LOG02|5.0|When one of the women in my bookclub chose this book for the month's read, I thought I was in for a history lesson on the orphan train that came through North Dakota many years ago. Interesting I was sure, but probably a bit dry. I was in for a surprise. I loved the book! The book tells a history of the trains but it is told through the eyes of a woman, Vivian, who rode one of them at the age of 9. She told the story in flashbacks, often to a young girl named Molly who needed to hear the story. Both of them were orphans and each had something to teach the other. It takes place in 2011 but flashes back to the late 20's and through the 30's when times were really tough throughout this country. It's a fast read and one that will stay with you for some time.
0061351342|5.0|This book always been happy and find it in a presentation as beautiful and as old fascinates me. Highly recommended.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the most well written books I've ever had the joy of reading. The imagery and voice are superb throughout. If you have the patience, I highly recommend this novel.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|I like movies with a twist at the end! Anthony Hopkins is an excellent actor. I would definitely recommend this movie
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, hard to put down. Enjoyed how the characters came together. Second book I've read by Liane Moriarty, and liked this one even better than the last (What Alice Forgot).
B005HEWMJ6|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan from the beginning. Voyager is the best series that was written. It made you a part of the crew, like no other. I wish that it had gone on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game!!!!!! The minions are just like in the movies. I laughed so hard at the different costumes and the way they act in them.
B0055PMURG|5.0|My 8 and 11 year old love this movie.  Very inspirational and based on a true story.  My daughter liked it so much she even purchased the book.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this show but wish they would make more of them. I am not sure if this is what you could call a series or not since there do not appear to be more than four episodes. I sure hope they continue to make them. I recommend the show. I ordered what I thought were new DVD's however but I do not think they were. The case was broken in one of them as has been the case with other items I have ordered through Amazon. I never get used because I do not wish to go through the hassle of returning items. These were useable but obviously used.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|While Jobs was brilliant, creative and persistent, he treated<br />people dreadfully, family, friends, co-workers.  He must have<br />had some sort of narcissistic personality disorder to so<br />consistently abuse people.  It was interesting to hear how<br />many of the advances of Apple came to be.  If the end does<br />not justify the means, Apple does not justify the behaviors<br />of Jobs.  Kind of a mad Hitler in his ways.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this story. I was very surprised by the ending.Actually very surprised with the whole book. I would tell everyone to read it!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Thought this Movie was excellent.  A little bit of everything with this movie. Comical, Educational, Violent, Gruesome, Action and some really sad scenes.  I think they hit alot of different nerves with this one.
B004132HZS|5.0|Again like my review on the first set I love the show but wasn't happy that what was supposed to be a new item was obviously used. had the right coating around it to be new but was very obvious to me it had been used.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Kind of a chick flick....good starter film for Julianne Hough. I think the character bad assed husband was over done.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a greAt game for kids. Mine love it. It's educational. It's brightly colored and loads and loads of great family fun.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Hysterical movie that is obviously not just for life at 40.<br />Could be 30 or 50 but everyone can relate to this movie , especially if you are married with kids.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like the Reacher novels where we see glimpses of the miltary man he was before become the Nomad of Justice. This one strikes a balance between hints of the past and current Reacher-style. Otherwise memorable, well-written scenes but nothing that Reacher hasn't been through before. I do have to say that I thought the villians strectched credibility more than usual. As a sidenote, I really like the short story which is Reacher in his military prime. Fun stuff.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|Never heard of this author before, but liked a review and took a chance. This is my favorite book of the year. A truly<br />enjoyable mystery with no chance of solving. Kept me guessing till the very end. This is also part of a trilogy, the second book. I really hope they translate all the other ones.
B00EVRHE8E|5.0|Once again Rainbow Rowell hits it out of the park with her latest release. Funny, emotional, engaging, it truly had it all. Can't recommend it enough!
B005SAYRA6|5.0|A Movie that gets your adrenaline going!  Action packed for sure! Even my 8 and 11 year old were glued to this movie.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this story! It was beautifully written with complex characters, I couldn't put it down! Not your typical love story.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A sweet story done well.  We were surprised at how well Julianne acted in this movie...she's a real natural!  I recommend this movie!
B00821OX98|4.0|Good show. Some originality. Noah Wiley does a good job and the supporting cast keeps up a decent pace of intrigue.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Very good Romantic movie.  Definately one to watch again.... Loved the story line. Have a box of tissues for sure!

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I did not care for this book. Even with the convoluted twists it was all too predictable. Characters were not well developed. In my opinion just a beach read to be tossed when done or left at an airport for a passenger to pass time with.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This book started off with too much drama and seemed very depressing. I'm reading it for the book club and would not have suggested it.  It can hold my attention but would like to see more positive actions in the book.
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|Iron Man 3 (Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack) is a great / funny to have in your collection. Great ending.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game is fun to play, and  gets more challenging as you go on. I highly recommend this game to all adults .
B008602KQI|4.0|Having read the book first I was curious to see what Hollywood would do to it.  I was pleased to see that the movie did the book justice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It would be a good read for any book club.  I had suggested the book for our club.  Everyone liked it.  Based on a true story gave it real meaning.

B009V3KKXY|5.0|Very well illustrated and help full I think this book is very well laid out and very easy to follow
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I have finished reading the 3 books and I gotta tell you, it was better than I thought.  Do not think it is a book about bondage.  That is only a tiny, and I mean tiny piece of it.  The book is more about the different shades of Christian Grey.  ANd unwrapping him and seeing what is inside this man kept my attention more than the sex scenes.  Which were still there, and not overdone as I thought it would be.  The second book tells of Christian and Anastatia's relationship in marriage.  The ups and downs and how &#34;Mrs. Robinson&#34; still pops up and causes trouble.  But you also see the love of his family and how they yearn for Christian to be happy.  All of us have issues in life, but to have people who love you and only what your happiness, isn't that something we all can agree on?  Read the whole series.  You'll find it not what you thought it would be.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Good movie. What else can I say? Ironman and explosions! I think it the best ironman yet. Would watch again in a heartbeat.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Would recommend to anyone that<br />Likes the 80's, computers, and the<br />Possibility of a virtual reality.  After reading i am Wanting my own max headroom assistant.

B0039TD7PY|3.0|I am probably old-fashioned (being over 60).  Although I loved watching the video of Carole and James on PBS, when I play the CD it is annoying to hear all the applause between songs (without seeing their faces as they appreciate all the love from the audience).  I finally realized that for me, buying the original albums would be more to my liking.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|one of the best books I've read. will probably read it again and again. Books one and three were also very good reading!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a neat gadget. Now I can watch Netflix and Youtube on the big screen with minimum hassles. Buy yours!
B00013BN4S|5.0|Harris is a talented entertainer with aging but good looks and she knows her way around a studio.<br />Good selections of down to earth country music that you don't hear on the radio anymore.
B000002KHF|5.0|I had this as a vinyl album years ago, so it's very nice to have the CD.  &#34;Three more words&#34; - give me a break !
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|You CAN get this and use the Digital Copy on iTunes.  Great movie, great combo pack.  I've already watched this like 12 times.  The original Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan was awesome, this is on another level and faithful to the original story line.
B005HEF8OC|5.0|Star Trek: Enterprise is an amazingly good show that is a significant credit to the Star Trek &#34;Universe.&#34;<br />Besides just being very well, and originally written, the show pays brilliant homage to the &#34;future&#34; world of the original Star Trek series.  References to mundane factors of life on contemporary earth; trepidation with certain fledgling technologies; human introduction and interaction with new species; as well as the very nature of the Enterprise's mission all provide just the right feel to give even the most serious fan the sensation he's watching a preliminary to Roddenberry's classic.  Additionally, actors are extraordinarily well cast, and don't &#34;overplay&#34; their roles as with some...earlier...spin-offs.  This is a great show, and a &#34;must-see&#34; for any Sci-Fi fan and/or Trekkie/Trekker!
B001BANK32|5.0|I've read this book when it first came out - I was just a teenager and it gave me the shivers, really creeped me out. This is the second time around I'm reading The Shining and it is still as good. I recommend reading it first before going into Dr. Sleep, which I will start in a few seconds. Happy shivers youall!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Every cliche, very predictable, and would be laughable if it wasn't trying to be serious. Would have been good maybe 20+ years ago. Save your money.
B00D28TNT6|4.0|If only their name was something I could say in front of my kids.  Epic, wonderful album. This album carries on the next evolution started with the last Weatherall produced outing.  Overall, solid and worth picking up.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It takes a long time to learn all of the characters, but once you get them down, you will be addicted. The best part is how realistic it is made and how the storyline is not predictable at all. You never know what George RR Martin (the author of the book) is going to do next.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|this is a great season and a great deal on here. every one should get it if you like SOA.
B008MM9630|5.0|I enjoy playing Fairy Farm.  I had no problems downloading on to my kindle fire.  The graphics are great and  I can play the game anywhere.
B008JFUO72|1.0|Do NOT buy this DVD product if you use iTunes to manage your digital content.  The digital copy included here can only be played on VUDU, Amazon and Google players. . . NO iTunes.  The packaging does not denote this and it is intentionally vague/deceptive.
B005D63ICI|4.0|I was always amazed at how Dexter would make things believable in past seasons. It just is tough for dramas to keep things suspenseful while still making you believe how the main character gets out of tough situations. This season I felt like they finally had to start relying on Dexter getting lucky to get out of tough situations more than they used to.
B000002KHF|3.0|I prefer the best of Van Morrison,so much better than this track...He also has so many newly dated tunes I love.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I am not completely caught up with current shows, but it never gets old. I would recommend this show to anyone who like an interesting story line, complex characters, and great entertainment.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Bruce Willis is a awesome actor and whenever he is in the movie  we know it is going to be action packed.  And this movie was no disappointment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looked forward to every episode.  Kept the interest throughout each series.  Highly recommend watching.  Can't wait to see next series on my iPad.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Pro: Cheap Father's Day gift with action<br /><br />Con: Disk skipped a bit, and the movie itself didn't live up to previous Die Hard movies.<br /><br />All in all it was a good buy, but will probably be in the $5 bin in Walmart soon.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|Stan Getz.  My hero.  I listened to his playing back in the 60s when I was a teenager when he used to play along with Joao Gilberto and Joao's sister or wife or whatever she was (Astrud) sang The Girl from Ipanema.  The notes that follow the first part of the song are so enchanting, smooth, glistening, whatever you want to call it, that I was virtually transported to another time dimension and I believe I hallucinated a little, too.  God it was great!!!  Stan Getz remains unequaled to this day in my mind as the premier saxophonist of all time.  I dare you to oppose this point of view.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I remember the book from when I was little and thought that the movie was better than the book. Would like to see Hansel and Gretel 2.
1400069742|5.0|This book is well written and extremely interesting.  The period of time it covers is quite short, but the conflict between opposing viewpoints on entering what became World War II is riveting.  The author describes very well the major players in the conflict, as well as the socio-political characteristics of the time.  Some readers may see the book as biased in favor of FDR, but it's also important to realize that FDR was the one who had to make the decision about the nation entering the war.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|Entertaining movie, but not as good a movie as I was expecting for a Classic.  Will probably not watch again.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is the best, what can I say?  Winter of the World, the Second book in this Century Trilogy, is just mesmerizing.  I'm going to have to read it again someday when I have time!  LOL  Time?  Did I say time?  Who has time?  I must have had some time at one time, because I read this book.  But I'm a fast reader.  Tell me something.  Does having a Kindle make you able to read faster?  Just kidding.  Go ahead.  Read this book.  You'll love it!
B0053TMP24|4.0|I loved this book and so did my family.  There are not too many books that can do that for us.  I have 2 boys 7 years apart and they both like it.  It's just a great ready and a great story!!<br /><br />T
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I have an iPad 2, and it mirrors perfectly on the TV with any HDMI cable to stream Netflix or any other app you may want to use.  I bought 2 of them and I've used it at least once / month over the course of a year and have no regrets.
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|A friend recommended... I felt like I was reading a cookbook with easy recipes for the problems in Life.<br />And if you are not a looser, and if you follow the recipes right you might even become a Billionaire...<br />Ohh please!!! Instead of buying this crap,  bitchslap yourself in the mirror and get a life!<br />I Choose Myself rather than this B.S.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  Love everything about it, love everyone in it (with the possible exception of Mr. Bates).  All the actors do a wondrously fine, excellent job, and the era and English people represented are just my cup of tea.  I'm learning a lot about the fashion and customs of the day and it is just making me love this show even more.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I loved the app but no sooner did I install that the virus protections on my phone and Kindle sent warnings that this app had serious virus issues so I had to uninstall it right away.  What a wast of time and money.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book is a good sequel to the \\"Shining\\" however it's purpose is not to scare.  The books is more about overcoming personal demons they any lovecraftian horror.  The antagonist in the book are not all-powerful as the bigger issue is how Danny is handling his own issues from the traumatic childhood through his actions as a adult.  However while much was made of Danny having to atone for his past, the Deus ex machine at the end ruined the ending for me.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this very fun game.  Better and much easier than Bad Piggies.  I haven't invited any friends to play.  But it is fun.
0812986180|4.0|The book is worth reading. Piper's account is poignant and unsparing and will make anyone wonder what the point of a prison is: punishment or rehabilitation. I have a family member in prison and so it was helpful in understanding her experience; she recommended the book (after I had already started reading it). One observation that really made sense to me is that going to prison is somewhat like entering a parallel universe where time runs at a different rate, the rules are different, and the people you meet are versions of themselves that are unlike the ones you might have encountered elsewhere, outside. I have not seen the TV show, nor do I intend to watch it.
B00932A4XE|4.0|It was ok I enjoyed it. It was cute and funny. However I don't think I would ever watch it again.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Love this game except for the fact that updates and new missions all arrive a week or more later than everyone else. Really bad when it's a timed mission.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fam ever since it was on television.  I have enjoyed this set very much.  The remastering is incredible.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I didn't want it to end!  The characters are well-developed, and I quickly became invested in their story.  I will read more by this author.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Fantastic movie, it's embarrassing that I like it so much but it's great, the singing is fun and the story is pretty good
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I love Vampire movies, this movie kept me guessing and kept me intrigued. I would highly recommend this movie to all fans of Vampires!
B000VX4X54|5.0|I have been buying these for 20+ years now.  I know this sounds a little out there, but I always have 2 pair--1 well-worn pair (these shoes last practically forever--mine are over 5 years old) and 1 newer, nicer-looking ones.  I rotate them as needed.<br /><br />The quality of these shoes has not diminished at all.  They are very well made and the materials are of high quality.<br /><br />They just slip on and are a really comfortable casual shoe that I literally wear almost every day.  I highly recommend them.
B001224WBS|5.0|Like the tittle says THE BEST OF, as soon as you see that you should be clicking the &#34;buy&#34; button specially if the album is $5 bucks!!! If not, still a good buy!!
B0098XY5VK|5.0|this game is a very good game.It is a challenging game wich teaches your kids that when you get a job you have to do your best.Thats what my little Timmothy learned and I was so proud of my little baby.I approve of this game and message
B000SX9IXO|5.0|Classic music from a great band. I have been listening to this album, in various forms for a lot of years. It never gets old.
B001DF68MA|4.0|I loved the product and was very excite. Unfortunately my bike didn't have enough clearance. You need about two inches of exposed none moving frame to install the bar. You need this under the seat and where the handlebars are attached to the frame.
B009YG2ND8|1.0|I can't figure out how to save the game.  It only lets me go to quicksave and then continue but then I go to the main menu and it only let me start a new game or go to a save game butmy game isn't in there.  I can't seem to defeatthe turtle and there are no instructions anywhere.  I am sorry I bought this because I don't know where to go foranswers and it costs 15$
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|Great story,& what we all wish we could do,the ending is sad but true,some people talk about living,he did,& to the fullest.
B008C20TDG|5.0|About 10 months ago I went to the doctor and he gave me some rather negative news that I would need to change lose some weight and change some habits, or I would be looking at diabetes in my future. It runs in the family. He suggested the paleo diet and this book. I bought the Kindle version that day and started the Whole30 the next day. After 3 months my numbers were significantly improved. My doc used the word 'remarkable'. Since then I have not stayed on the strict paleo diet, but my attitude toward food has changed such that I've been able to maintain better habits and keep the weight off. I would recommend this book to anyone concerned about the role of diet on their health. That should include pretty much everyone.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I was wondering to myself how to do this review of this Metallica live CD, and choice to do it this way a track by track summery, then my whole summery at the end of the review.  The CD is divided into two CD'S and is 16 songs.  CD one is all live tracks, and CD two is 7 live tracks and one classic song from the Master of Puppets album.<br />Track One: Classic Opening song for any Metallica concert has a great feel to it and enjoy the audience singing along.<br />Track Two: Creeping Death great song to open the set with and one of my personal favorites of the band what made it even better was audience so into it singing with James on the chorus die, die, die....amazing voice sounding.<br />Track Three: For Whom the Bell Tolls another classic Metallica song and great echo effect on the song, makes you feel like your really at the concert.<br />Track Four: Fuel good song and amazing engery from James and the audience just interacting together very powerful stuff.<br />Track Five: Ride the Lightning great flashback song and also good music from a good album, just a minor setback with the mic acting up on James fading out then coming back strong, you could tell James voice is much clear and makes for an amazing concert sound quality wise.<br />Track Six: Great intro to a classic song One and video that started Metallica's video libary. You can actually hear the gun fire and bombs going off as the airplane drops them.  For sure a powerful song and lyrics wise, and savor the audience humming along with James.<br />Track Seven: James shows his humor side by telling the fans he sometimes forgets the lyrics so needs help from them on this song The Memory Remains.  One of Favorites also of Metallica's lineup.  What did it for me was the auidence ending to this song with the humming and clapping along with James.<br />Track Eight: Wherever I May Roam just a great song and the echo effect makes you feel like your there.<br />CD 2<br />Track One: Cyanide great song off the last album the guitar workings and drums truly mind blowing effects<br />Track Two: And Justice for All was played a little different guitar wise and any true Metallica fan can hear the difference in the song, they slow it down just a little bit in certain parts.  But still blows you away hearing it.<br />Track Three: Mater of Puppets The Jewel of the libary of Metallica one of the songs I enjoy singing along to every time I hear it.  They use the echo effect again on this song and stunning vocals again, the ending great with James laughing and crowd going wild.<br />Track Four: Starts with a pop going off like a firework, Battery you feel need to sing along and enjoy the part of James going \\"are you alive\\" then waits and says \\"then show me\\".<br />Track Five: One of Personal favorite's from this Live CD Noting Else Matters with great intro to it, and a song I almost know every lryic to and sings along with it each time I hear it.<br />Track Six: Enter Sandman another intro pop like fireworks, then the start the song and great sound effects until the Amp makes a big pop and injuries two fans but they not serious hurt and concert continues.  You can honestly tell James voice is back for good.<br />Track Seven:  Hit the Lights they get new amps up onto stage and James jokes with the auidence \\"this is what it is like in our garage...reminds me of Kill Them All\\" then goes into the last live song you can tell the auidence is just thrilled and amped for the show.  Makes you just want to bang your head to the song.<br />Track Eight: Orion is on here but to the trained Metallica Fan it sounds a tad different to the original song but still a great song and music.<br />Summery: I shall state the facts no songs from St. Anger and Load but oh well still a great live CD and proves James and the crew are still here and still kicking it with the best of the them.  The song lineup is great and brings back great memories of great music by an amazing metal rock band.  As stated earlier youcan hear the differences in some of the songs played lived compare to the orginal versions but so what still makes you want to bang your head and makes you feel like your there with the sound quality.  One of the best live albums I have ever heard in my lifetime.  Only two issues in the concert with Ride the Lightning with the mic fading out, and Enter Sandman with the amp poping and fans getting hurt.  But still I am fan of Metallica they are my favorite band and forever shall be.can hear the differences in some of the songs played lived compare to the orginal versions but so what still makes you want to bang your head and makes you feel like your there with the sound quality.

B00CWQ5Y3S|5.0|this is an incredible app! You can zoom in or out and watch as planets transit the sun, see the phases all the plantes go thru depending on your perspective. it can be set to run fast or nornal with a slider. Definitely worth the money!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Since I do not have access to the broadcast Dr Who, I create my own world with the DVD sets. I watch when I want, not when someone tells me! I will not say anything about the plots because that would be spoilers but I have only watched the first episode...the Christmas one. I LOVED IT.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|First let me say, I am not a young adult, so I am not part of this book's intended demographic group. I read Eleanor and Park several months ago, and I immediately became a Rainbow Rowell fan. I don't read fanfiction, so I didn't know what to expect with this book. The ff outtakes frustrated me a bit early on in the book, as I was much more interested in the freshmen at college plot. However, as I progressed through the book, I began to understand why Rainbow included them when she did. I loved how she mixed in Cather's own ff with the author's work. Rainbow continues to evolve as a YA author, and I can't wait for her next novel! Rainbow, if you're out there...keep on writing!!
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Like the Metallica review I just wrote today I am going to do the same for this Papa Roach CD.  Track by Track list of how I viewed the meaning behind each song of the album plus the bonus DVD of music videos of their's.<br />Track One: Engage just a good musical intro no words<br />Track Two: Still Swingin, A song about not giving up while your survive day by day plus never losing hope<br />Track Three: Where did the Angels go, A song about being in a dark place in your life while looking for a way out<br />Track Four: Silence is the Enemy, A song about speaking up for what you believe in while showing others they need to speak up too about this enemy.<br />Track Five: Before I Die, A song about trying to heal the wrongs commited during your lifetime so everyone can move on without feeling like weight on your shoulders.<br />Track Six: Wish you never meet me, A song about facing the chance of a breakup and you can feel the pain within the lead singer's voice as he sings the song.<br />Track Seven: Give me back my Life, A song about reaching your breaking point and desire to have your old life back you can also feel the hurt anger dispare so forth within the lyrics.<br />Track Eight: Breathe you in, A song about learning to recover from the pain, hurt, from a relationship as you feel you can breathe again and move on.<br />Track Nine: Leader of the Broken Hearts, One of my personal favorite's on the album, A song about being able to move forward even with a broken heart because you realize your still alive even after all the pain and hurt.<br />Track Ten: Not that Beautiful, A song about how the power of words can bring down a person and make them feel like less a person and not worthy of love.<br />Track Eleven: Walking Dead, A song about not paying attention to one another couple wise and just going threw the motions each day and not feeling alive at all.<br />Track Tweleve: Won't Let Up, A song about no matter what happens in your life you never ever give up and you learn to \\"keep your head up.\\"<br />Track Thirteen: As far as I Remember, A song about wanting to start fresh and making amends by \\"Turning the Page.\\"<br />Track Fourteen: What's left of Me, A song about ending it once and for all and not letting the person take anymore from you that you already given to the person during the relationship.<br />Track Fifteen: 9th Life, A song about keep on going no matter how many lives or chances you have used up along the way because may be the last life or chance you get so make best of it.<br />DVD: Music videos of Kick you in the Teeth: See guy with chip on his shoulder get beat up badly and just keep on going. Burn: You feel the anger in the lyrics and great special effects on the actual burning alive scene unedited music video. No Matter What: Very powerful lyrics and can see the bond of the buddies doing everything together to get out of situation they are in.  Still Swingin: Last man alive fighting zombies and living day by day and still has photo of him and his brother holds onto that memory as keeps on living on. Great behind scenes look at the video and fact the lead singer's seven year old son came up with the idea of the video.  Last great look at the making of the cover artwork on the computer.<br />Summery: This CD lyrics wise shows how a person can go threw a relationship with himself and another person, realize the wrongs commited while trying make amends to himself and other person. Then when it ends and have a broken heart but your alive you learn to move on and realize your full potential by \\"Keep your head in.\\"you learn to \\"keep your head up.\\"<br />Track Thirteen: As far as I Remember, A song about wanting to start fresh and making amends by \\"Turning the Page.\\"<br />Track Fourteen: What's left of Me, A song about ending it once and for all and not letting the person take anymore from you that you already given to the person during the relationship.<br />Track Fifteen: 9th Life, A song about keep on going no matter how many lives or chances you have used up along the way because may be the last life or chance you get so make best of it.<br />DVD: Music videos of Kick you in the Teeth: See guy with chip on his shoulder get beat up badly and just keep on going.

B00E7SFAAG|5.0|I have to hand it to these guys. They made a great one here. The gameplay is flawless, though it does get tricky as it goes along. There are plenty of levels, and all of the backgrounds are beautiful. More items might've been nice, but that's just a quibble compared to all of the fun packed into this program. Definitely worth it!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|My favourite fps game on kindle, but it spontaneously kicks me for being idle in the menus when I was waiting for respawn. Please take out this function, it does more harm than good
B0055QYKQO|1.0|motherboard worked well for first month and then stopped running. No problems with power supply or other ancillary parts. No damage to board, disappointing that I just past the return period.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|One does expect pure escapist entertainment when viewing the Iron Man films or other movies based upon action heros. Perhaps I expected too much after thoroughly enjoying Iron Man I and II and after reading the terrific reviews of Iron Man III. Unfortunately, I found this one to be corny in both the story line and dialog. It seemed to focus on the special effects, almost exclusively. I'm a big fan of both Robert Downey JR. and Gwyneth Paltrow and am disappointed that they made this film.
B00E1SJDJG|3.0|None of the songs ever build to much, or go anywhere. Whereas Bill Callahan at his best makes you sit up and pay attention, some of this borders a little close to lounge jazz/ background music for my tastes. He also doesn't seem to have much of anything to say, barring the \\"beer\\" \\"thank you\\" joke in the first song. No choruses, or minor key melodies this time around. Another reviewer made a Leonard Cohen comparison, frankly this couldnt be further from the truth this time around. This sounds more like Van Morrisons lesser 80's stuff to me.Lots of flute and synth sounding guitars.    Probably would have given this only 2 stars were it by most anyone else, but I like Callahans voice,and I am a big fan, so screw it.
B00AXOPK6W|4.0|A real tribute to the author.<br />The illustrations are delightful.  The story is enhanced and the anticipation of the next scene adds to the excitement of the plot.
1595826971|3.0|Good condition upon arrival but cheap binding. Pages are still in place but the binding is tearing and some pages are no longer connected.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I am a big fan of both Leo and Toby and, as such would find it difficult to not like a film where both of them share the spotlight. I thought that both were very well cast in their roles. However, I found that the presentation of the story lacked something and the flow wasn't right. Can't quite put my finger on it more specifically but, I was disappointed.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I'm a Killers fan. I played this CD about twenty times before I brought it to my car. I can't wait to play it in an ipod while watching the sun rise from a beach in Florida.
B00DYCBH4O|4.0|Beautifully illustrated.<br />Reading a classic again is always a pleasure but this illustrated edition enhanced the narrative.<br />I would most certainly recommend it to others.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|How can anyone not love Dexter? Now that the series is over I don't know what I'm gonna do. Gonna watch the series again.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|The characters from Brandt Legg's \\"Outview\\" stayed in my mind long after I had finished the book - I felt, in some ways bereft, and hurried back to download \\"Outin,\\" the second installment of the Inner Movement trilogy - the hardest section, in my opinion, the middle that tends to sag like a beery old gentleman's waistline.<br /><br />I do not know Mr. Legg, but assume he is svelte - as is the continuing journey of young Nate, his traveling companions and the brother he has helped escape from the high whispering walls of an insane asylum. Again, we are treated to Legg's signature style of fantasy and the paranormal mixed with the wisdom of the ancients and a glimpse of the abyss that separates utopia from dystopia - in fact, I imagine the author has peered into that dark space himself and it is from that point that he has stood back and created a story for young people that contains a philosophy that they may not entirely understand but which will cling to them like a burr and guide them in the sure subtle way in which the author writes his books.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Really strange story. I don't believe this could ever happen but in this day and age anything is possible. Looking forward to the next book in this series.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Great story and concept. But the ending is like she just got tired of writing and ended it with a life lesson. Boo for no closure
