B000CSGT64|5|Used these for pre and post pump filters on my 7.3 diesel van. Easy peasy. My fuel filter changes are a snap now!<br />Woot!
B0021KVFG0|5|easy to install.. and best price
B00SJYDNU8|4|This wire is much thinner than other 4ga wires. The outside diameter is the same but it has a very thick outer cover. I need to add a little extra wire for my current amp install. All of my current wire is monster cable. I realize this is a cheaper cable than the monster cable but the wire diameter is significantly different. I realized it wasn't the fine strand copper wiring but not only is it a lower quality wire material it contains much less actual wire. The monster cable has a thick core of fine strand copper with a thin outer jacket. This wire has a small diameter of metal with a very thick outer jacket. This is just a rough comparison with some wire I have laying around but it's more like a 6 gauge wire placed in a 4 gauge sized outer cover. For most uses im sure it works fine. If you truly need a 4ga wire be careful with the specs of this one. I'm only running 2 500W amps with this wire so at just a few feet for grounding I should be fine using this...I'm using 0ga main line to a 4ga splitter with my monster cable wire. This is just extra I needed for a short ground wire from each amp. I'll update if I have any grounding issues which I doubt... :)
B000VAOD9I|5|great price
B009DJQRM4|3|Need telephone number to call the store.
B0041CE5KE|5|Perfect, minimum plate mount, adjustable.
B000XOLKGG|5|love it works great
B00NP3SQN2|5|Shipping was fast, looks awesome.<br />Don't use these on license plate you will get a ticket.
B00C15M4WO|4|Good Phone for the money.
B00CFM9QLA|5|How I don't have a mess in the back of my car very good trunk organizer
B00YSVHTJC|2|I thought it would be shiny like 99%of bumper stickers you see. It'll probably fade due to th3 elements. I put a clear coat of spraypaint on mine, so it's not an issue anymore. I was just dissapointed. Also, the size is smaller than most bumper stickers
B001O0TZ7E|5|No need for brake quiet fluid
B001IWZ00O|5|Saved my mid-priced helmet from the trash! Very easy to replace using an ordinary flat head screwdriver. A real bargain over buying a new helmet. Thanks for stocking this replacement piece.
B00BV6EZB2|2|I recently installed this part on my brother in-law's truck. The fit was good on the bottom side, but at the top connection, there was a lot of slop In the steering once torqued. I had to shim the top square joint to make up the difference of the slop. Once the shim was installed, the fit was perfect and the steering was as good as new according to the owner. Nice part, but poor machine work at the top connection.
B007PAHHWM|5|good stuff!!
B00D313GR2|1|Worst decal I've ever used. Colors were off making it look not so professional. Tiny air bubble tore the decal ruining it. Would not buy from here again. Wasted 7 dollars
B00KQHCABO|4|VERY NICE SPOILER, THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE A BIT LACKING
B005DJPLZM|4|Sticky fell off after couple weeks. But I love the look.
B00O5BCEMM|5|Exactly as described. Super fast ship happy customer.
B008KWP1UO|5|Installed it into my MKIV GLI 1.8T.  Perfect fit, really easy to clean and no need for oil.  Time to order one for my '15 Explorer Sport.
B0082365AQ|4|Took some ingenuity to make sure this cart stays put under my kayak, but makes hauling a breeze. I haul in soft sand on beaches and the inflatable wheels make the chore easier but sand does get trapped between the wheel hub and frame. For the price it is a great product.
B001EOYK98|5|Goo, would buy againd quality
B0064FXRWI|5|Not as yellow as I wanted, but yellow enough! Good quality
B00QGXSODA|4|This is a solid unit that I purchased to be able to work on my airplane avionics and engine without hanging off a ladder. It was easy to  assemble and set up and feels sturdy when I use it. I am about 190lbs and it's strong enough not to wobble or move while I work.
B00CKGAEIU|5|Very easy to install. I loved it. I didn't have to pay a mechanic. Lol.
B00H4N0BL4|5|oem yes it is great buy
B000BZIP9M|5|Very easy install. Each box was marked with a different mfg. name. Same part number. After checking I found out that they are made by the same company. Same excellent quality. Harold
B0018JVDRG|1|IF YOU HAVE A CIVIC Si MODEL, DO NOT BUY THESE. JUST BECAUSE IT SAYS THEY FIT THE CAR DOES NOT MEAN THEY WILL WORK. THESE THINGS ALMOST WRECKED MY CAR. CAUSED MISFIRE. THERE ARE ONLY TWO BRANDS/MODEL NUMBERS THAT WORK FOR THIS CAR AND THESE ARE NOT IT. THANKS AMAZON, YOU COST ME TWICE THE MONEY I REALLY NEEDED TO SPEND ON CHANGING PLUGS. NOW I HAVE TO EAT THE COST ON THESE AND TOSS THEM AS I'M SURE YOU WON'T GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. FUMING MAD CUSTOMER!!! YOU'RE &#34;GARAGE&#34; FUNCTION IS TERRIBLE.
B00HVI7EQ2|5|Very girly and cute! Fits perfectly and I receive many compliments!
B00K71RLVI|1|I have had these bulbs installed in my 2006 Honda Accord Coupe. To start with, they are not bright during the day at all. Cars yielding to me never know when I am turning left. About 6 months ago, the driver side bulb would flicker, only when the parking light was on. I began to notice a few of the LED's completely stopped working. Then shortly after, the left side began to flicker. It is to the point that it looks like I purposely have flashing lights at night. I would highly suggest you choose an alternative bulb.<br /><br />PROS:<br />NONE<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.DIM<br />2.Flicker<br />3.LEDs stop working
B000GZPCYI|5|Awesome product!!!
B00HNR3HCQ|3|Hose fits but the o-ring package included with this hose did not the correct size for my application. I had to order the correct size o-ring delaying my job. Very aggravating.
B00480FIMI|5|I was a little surprised at how much brighter they are compared to the bulbs I replaced. I am not sure what the previous bulbs were,since I just recently purchased this vehicle but they said Made in Germany.  They provide a much wider and further field of vision.  I would purchase them again depending on how long they last.
B004BOXKN0|3|I got these for my klr 650,I really like them now that there on,but installing them was a pain,no directions at all,had to wing it
B00D2PLR0C|5|My parents gave this to us last Christmas. They're always worried about our cross country trips to visit family. Finally had to use it last Saturday. It hadn't been charged since January, and it jumped our dead minivan in seconds. Can't complain.
B004RNOVTM|5|A quality hose just the right length to fill my dog's outside water bowl.  Worth the additional cost for a heavy-duty well made drinking hose.
B00MEVO5U4|3|One came broken in two places. I super glued it back and seems fine for now. They're pretty hopefully the sun doesn't change their color too fast.
B00TAP8NTQ|4|Everything seems good after I fi ally got all the wiring sorted.<br /><br />Why they want both relays to trigger off the same power is unknown on an H1 system. I had to rewire things to get this to work as a hi and low beam system on my 1150gs. It wasn't hard but it could be a problem for someone not used to wiring relays. The way it comes wired would have the hi and low beam on all the time.<br /><br />As other reviews have said they're a nicely packaged system and seem to warm up quicker than the cheap auction site kits. I hope they last longer too.
B00TP11HTS|4|Good so far!
B007TYASSO|5|Perfect match and so far so good. I purchased this on March 2015 and it works very well. I purchased an ACDelco and it crapped out on me 6 months later. I'm hoping this will last me longer.
B00A80EVXO|5|Very visible despite of its small size. Quality is excellent too. I ordered 3 pieces. One each for each sides and one for the back. Tailgating were reduced drastically. Most drivers were considerate and some even smiles for letting them know that the driver in charge is a student. Highly recommended.
B00E5K9S0E|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B00ODOQ30K|1|I've had them for a month and they are already coming on and off when they want to
B00M1OUBES|5|I really like this product it is really great I would like to get another one
B00P9QKPEG|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B0045OZ2AA|5|It seems made out of durable plastic and It gives my car just the right amount of sparkle
B00XICGK2Y|5|As we know things are not manufactured like they use to be but I will say this dish performs as advertised . We have used it about 30 times camping and with in 1 min it has found the satellite and we are watching tv even in woods when we thought it would have a hard time it found the satellite quickly . It's nice to have something work !!!!!! We had a manual dish that worked ok if you found the dish but took along time
B001JSY9Q8|1|Honestly after three or fours coins, it won't go through down properly, sometimes the coins struck inside. Anyway I have returned this products.
B000XQ2S4M|5|Used this to vacuum out the system on my 03 Impreza.  Did a great job!  While vacuuming the system was as low as 30-31 HG, and after remained and stabilized around 28-29 HG.  Money well spent, because taking my car to an auto shop to vacuum and recharge my system would have cost more than this pump!  Just an FYI for any DIY-ers, this vacuum is meant for an AC system that is completely VOID of all R134a.  My Impreza's condenser had a leak in it and all the R134a was out of the AC system entirely.  If you're not sure about AC systems, there are tons of forums out there explaining how to use a vacuum pump, find leaks, etc. in your system.  Don't feel overwhelmed, I did it myself using forums and youtube videos (though I would consider myself a solid weekend warrior mechanic).
B00SSF6U26|5|I never hear any rattles as some reviewers have suggested.
B004XB4OPE|5|did not fit
B005OJ3RSO|5|Everything needed to replace grill complete with instructions
B005JU5W54|5|Though common autoparts stores nor Bosch list it, 19B and 26A do fit on the 2015 Outback. TireRack had it listed, and I tried it, and it works. Can't go wrong with the Bosch ICON.
B00I9T2DY0|1|I received the wrong size air filter
B002E58100|5|Perfect fit. Exactly what we needed!
B004ZO3VN0|2|Not all that great. Maybe if it was $10
B003SWNVI0|4|ok here it goes the bag itself was great lots of room we put 4 huge duffle bags packed to the max into it plus a little one we also put 2 beach umbrellas and 3 adult folding chairs in a bag plus 1 child's fold up chair in a bag . The bad part the straps that came with it did not work didn't even get them attached and they broke . The bag is great use bungee cords with it instead . Drove 5 1/2 hours no problems . Would of gave this 5 stars if the straps worked .
B00ZA17PUM|4|Slow delivery. Otherwise, perfect.
B0002Z9L7G|4|This is a very good seat belt adjustor. It's easy to install and stays where I slide it. My only issue is it sometimes twists and cuts into my waist, which is very uncomfortable.
B0007VNZMM|1|The bumper itself was ok...The fit was horrible...IT DOES NOT FIT THIS TRUCK.....I had to do a lot of modifications along with taking off the frame rail suspension bar on the back of the truck. I had to rework the original brackets to make it fit  so so. It sticks out 4-5 inches from the body. I wasn't going to return it as I had the old one off already....If you buy this be ready to spend 3-5 hours reworking brackets....cutting holes and cut a hole for the spare tire carrier shaft.
B009GLVYYA|5|Just as described and works perfectly on my Indian Roadmaster.
B00LGXI3B8|5|fits perfectly
B008AZA4C6|5|Has nice bass, the treble is pretty clear, and its super portable!
B008EM5RQI|5|These are fantastic!  You can easily move them around by hand (you can even scoot it a little with your foot) - but because of the way these are shaped - when your tire bumps it, it does not move - both sides are angled so that when the tire hits it the tire is putting more downward pressure on the curb than forward pressure.<br /><br />I have now purchased four of these - all are on a blacktop drive - NONE of them are anchored down - and ZERO problems so far with them moving around - and I have TEEN drivers at home.
B00BP55MA2|5|Exactly what I needed, Super fast delivery! Only needed one so have four spares, anybody need one?
B005DMBJFA|5|My husband loves this key fob. Not too large or heavy. Quality item.
B00029XD62|4|Great product
B00A7YJ59G|5|Used these to secure a car for transport 2000 miles. They worked great secured through the wheels and attached at the corners of the trailer. Didn't loosen, and the ratchets seem to be high quality.
B00OPH1M5G|4|This does what I need it to do.
B001S30IGY|5|Works great!
B000HAB88Q|3|I was able to make it work. At this price point, it's just fine. More universal holes for smaller license plate would be great. I needed to use this to adapt holes for a large plate to mount a small plate, but the design created interference with the mounting bolts. Maybe that's not what it's designed for. Anyway, since it's plastic, I was able to make it work.
B00JF5HR7K|3|We bought this to put on the back of our camping trailer for additional space.  It's very sturdy, but when you attach it to the hitch it moves too much.  We are going to use straps to secure it to the back of the trailer to make it more secure.
B001TKWRHO|5|Excellent product, will buy again but there wax still suck.
B0015S2GIU|5|Cost less then in major online store that's known for lowest prices. Pads are great no complains.
B00B8SZWAQ|4|It's a little big for my windshield, but it's so humorous I can over look that. Sometimes the suction cups don't hold as well as I'd like, but putting my visors down holds it in place just fine. Does a great job keeping my car cooler in the 100 degree summer heat.
B00SUTY2IY|5|Plastic, came from China pretty quick. I would buy this again
B0001EFSTI|5|I'm giving this 5 stars. I don't know if I like or hate the fact that the key comes off when you open it. Free star karma to Swiss+Tech since I can't seem to figure out what I want.
B0000AVZMU|4|These are a bit different than the photo.  Have a thicker housing and additional wording on the top plate that is not appealing to me.  All in all they are good anchor points and help to hold my bed rail caps in place.  Have several of these on all my trucks and this set has the thickest top cap.  They work great.
B00NNTT7WM|5|Great blanket for concerts and camping!
B009IE2O30|5|Used this for both my front and rear DIFF of my Ram 3500, 32000 miles good so far.
B00HT2Y7ZG|5|Worth it
B000BRJVCU|4|Excellent drop in fixture. Bulbs are a bit hot. We'll see if they melt the plastic.
B000N8GJ8Q|3|It works pretty well, but is 100% rigid which makes it bulkier than most. Also, the mirror gap is a bit wide and corners are an inch or two short.
B001G8AIMU|4|Great Experience
B004M09N0C|5|the string is a bit flimsy...but we replaced it with a heavier line and it is hanging fine!
B0068ODC1Q|5|Customer service was on point and I haven't had any problems with the remote I have a 2004 Chevy Tahoe
B00H459CJ4|4|Standard distributor, seems to be working fine
B000CINANE|4|I regret not buying the black instead of the chrome. I found it difficult to install without scratching the chrome. The instructions are useless, watch Youtube videos and use your brain.
B00KVVBEWQ|5|As always, Magellan has created a great product here.  Rather than discuss every little detail, I'd like to point out some very special features that this amazing GPS offers.<br /><br />Car vs RV mode:  The GPS can easily be switched between Car Mode and RV Mode.  In each mode the device tailors the information and experience to suit the appropriate mode of transport.  No more GPS direction to the car area, where your RV is not allowed, and so on.  Truly excellent.<br /><br />Screen size:  This GPS has a seven inch screen. For old eyes and less accurate finger taps this Magellan GPS offers a very large, crisp and clear color touch screen.  It's the size of a small tablet computer which really makes it easier to use, especially in car mode when it is generally closer to the driver, making it appear even larger.<br /><br />Bluetooth:  The wireless Bluetooth connection allows this GPS to connect to your cell phone.  It then works as your hands free set for safely making or receiving calls while on the road.  This is a great safety feature that truly can save lives.<br /><br />Speaking of safety features, this GPS can even warn you about speed limit changes and warn you when your speed creeps up beyond the speed limit.  Another potential life saver and certainly some protection against embarrassing speed related traffic stops.<br /><br />This is a great GPS for road travel.  It's as much as at home in a car as it is in an RV, so you only need to learn how to use one device.<br /><br />This Magellan is a great option and I feel absolutely comfortable recommending it to others.  Highly recommended!
B00NEL6ONO|5|Nice filter and fits perfectly in my 2015 Tacoma
B008S9QQ6C|5|High quality product.
B00OVQEX9S|5|Cute products!
B00G2TV7OG|5|SUPPER bright
B007XZK8EI|5|Love it!  Easy to put it on and it makes such a difference to the look of the car.
B002SSKFIY|3|somehow effective. thetford is the best.
B00KQ81M94|5|very good better than real one this one easier to use
B000CNB8U6|5|Great to deal with got the part and it didn't fit so it was a bad on my part went to return it and was told to keep it.  Cant complain about that.
B00RCFZZFG|2|top of this was never sewn.  cardboard backing was exposed when I opened the package.  may try to glue it and cross my fingers as it went half way across the top portion of the organizer.  like the size and layout.  have never attached it in the car.  dissappointed.
B00A6RLS8K|5|works great
B00EVY2SKG|5|I use there for computer screens, eye glasses, guitars, and a load of other things. Great!
B00HFWY2MI|1|XXXL size fits more like an XL helmet, sizes are off.
B007O5GWV0|5|Received my controller 3 days ahead of published arrival date. I installed it in less than 10 minutes, including basic programming. Can't wait to hookup the 5th wheel and hit the road.
B00NM5RC2E|5|Awesome. U are an amazing seller.
B00QNQOVC8|5|This hammock is amazing. It is super small and light weight. When I first ordered it I thought it was going to be the size of a drawstring bag you carry on your back, but that wasn't the case. When the box came I thought to myself that there was no way that was my hammock but when I opened it, sure enough it was. It also had fast shipping. Great product, I recommend 100%.
B0066SDJZS|5|I ordered this hose Monday from the states and it was delivered the next day to my house in Hamilton Ontario. Awesome, amazing shipping. The hose fit perfectly, and seems very durable. Would definitely buy again.
B0055AW0N0|4|Works ok but needs a longer insert for between the seats to avoid wobble.
B00EECLMWK|4|These are a great replacement or the OEM bulbs. Direct fit...only issue I had was one of the bulbs must have been defective, but after calling Kensun, they shipped me out another one and it works great. I like that they stand by their product. They suggested some possible solutions to the issue but ultimately shipped a new bulb for me to try.
B000W3RU9Y|5|Who doesn't love a bungee cord....  Tons of uses.  This particular item is very strong.
B000IVHXOW|1|Seems like it fit and then my car warning came on that I didn't have gas cap pressure. Bummer
B0069TND14|5|The lights are nice and bright and hold up great to salt water.
B007PP26RI|5|This product is the best I have tried, of any brand.  It worked perfectly from the get go.  I have had no problems with the product and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves an excellent value.  It is built to last and is efficient as it out performs all other products like it.  You won’t regret this purchase.<br /> This product gets top ratings 5★s
B005OL7K4E|3|Was a little disappointed with the print quality.
B00JCE51J0|5|EXCELENTE
B004VMEV9Y|5|This exhaust is top notch! No drone and after a few hundred miles it sounds great. I think it's doable for road trips too, a nice rumble at 80mph not bad. How a vette should sound like.
B000HBNVSK|5|right product for assembling engines
B000BZAAF4|5|Its Timken, of course its good! This is one of the best brands for bearings. If you want a bearing to get by for a few years, get a crap 15$ one, but if you want it to last, get a Timken. Toyota trusts them enough to use them as the OEM choice, so I would say that speaks to their quality.
B00KVO32E6|3|One of the bulbs for the license plate did not function (tried reversing but not light).  The trunk LED could have been brighter, but it will do in a pinch.
B0002MBC08|5|item as stated and received on time
B0067ECOZW|4|I guess it works well. Has good reviews and I don't have any engine problems.
B0007ZDRUI|5|The product works and is easy to use.
B003CS0XYU|1|Did not fit had to return.  Too small for my Jeep after contacting the company several time to make sure was ordering the correct soft top for my Jeep.
B00AVZRQM4|5|love the products , very nice .....
B001ARNN0G|5|Items were as expected
B0012INT98|1|Tore the first time we used it.  Not happy. Flew off top of car on highway and broke several items inside,
B000C30J60|5|Changing the serpentine belt myself was a great idea thanks to this product. Saved tons of money!
B0009NUG66|5|This was water proof, I drove through some pretty good rain and nothing got wet.  I used this with the non-slip mat and car clips as I have a Camry without rails.  I had it really tight and it did not slip.  It seems pretty sturdy but would not put anything pointy next to the sides.
B000G72UOQ|1|The Super Jumbos do not fit the 2015 Toyota Sienna.  Too big by 2 inches.
B003BSB7PU|4|works
B004RCQT98|4|Excellent
B00T6J9NBI|5|Excellent replacement kit.
B00EI6CKVE|4|I still laugh every time I see it
B00562SE1O|5|Great produc.
B00K7935KQ|5|No complaints..shiny plastic frame which should do the trick of holding the plate without any problems.
B00HD9V5L4|5|Shipping was super quick. It was much cheaper than any other alternative I could find in Canada even with shipping and FX considered. It is exactly to OEM specs for my 2006 Mazda 3 Sport (hatchback), which made it a breeze to install.  The body colored cap from my damaged mirror was easily swapped over to this one.  Very satisfied with this product.
B0009IBJE4|1|Unit went dead after minimal use and it does not have a fuse or a reset switch. Not a value.
B001F532PY|5|worked perfect with the ride rite air bags.  made finishing easy.
B005GV58HS|5|Great
B006ZBPHVU|5|Fixed my leaking YZ250.
B005O25CXE|5|I had no problem installing the Auto Ventshade in-channel Ventvisor 0n my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It looks great on my all black Grand<br />Cherokee with the black wheel rims. Very happy with the ventshade.
B008SEBXIS|5|So good<br />Real blue light
B003L2VYZ4|4|works on my old detroit 6.2
B00CEXKC2M|5|Love it, looks great !!!!
B00MG2AQSG|5|Great product
B00OVW0CWE|5|Beautiful.
B000PCBFF2|2|I have an older sander,same model but the nut wont screw on with out widdeling on it.I'd buy this localy,easier to exchange
B00E4CQGVW|4|Great for driving east in the morning and west in the late afternoon. Fit is okay.
B000EOMB90|5|Works for 2014 Nissan Frontier on 5' truck bed with factory spray on liner, utility track, and bed extender. Received in less than a week from Amazon, and we were able to install it in about an hour, even though we are not very handy. Truck looks sharp after the cover was on. We will see how it holds up when it rains.  1/1/2016 We took the covered truck on a road trip and it rained most of the way. Some water did get in from the back where the truck cover folds, but nothing major since the little bit of water was only in the groove of the truck bed .
B00YB5GAEA|1|Interior not well secured, the rear popped out way too easily breaking a critical wire free of the circut board. Sadly my soldering skills are not up to snuff.
B00ABQV7T6|1|Cheap looking
B001O7PNNM|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B001B7A5SS|4|This part fit as intended however the o-rings that were supplied were too big. When set side by side with the original o-rings it was apparent that the supplied seals wouldn't fit.  I would recommend this drier but be sure you have an assortment of replacement seals on hand.
B0002L6ATC|4|Pricy for what you get.  But it fits the Mini-Cooper perfectly and is well made (for what it is)
B00JPYIS4W|3|not bad rear plate barely fits on dodge car, bought factory touch up paint to get the correct blue. Otherwise the wife was happy with it
B002NQ3ZPQ|5|Reping my Bike!
B000HEHCDW|3|It needs more secure bracket to hang on front.
B00BOVDCPE|4|I'm using this product on a Harley motorcycle windsheild. I bought this becuase i didn't want use the velcro strips that come with the EZ Pass. Was a little nervous about having it fall off but I like the size of the unit, not too bulky and depending on how its placed you can remove the EZ pass while leaving the holder on the windsheild. I've already used it for a long ride and so far so good.
B0010DZZVK|5|Fits my 2008 Subaru Legacy, nice!
B000IXUBIA|5|Fit and preformed as expected
B00YZ0Q4A6|4|Great
B002GTKAHQ|5|Can't go wrong with these. Nice looking, better view, easy install. Suzuki TU250
B00HYNT3OU|5|These are so adorable. I love them. Easy installation. No problems at all. Great seller.
B002935IV2|2|This was one of the most annoying products I have ever had to use.  I kept it because I HAD to have something underneath the carrier to keep it from sliding.  But, dealing with this was very difficult because it had to be placed EXACTLY under the carrier.  To tell the truth I never did find the sweet spot and ended up cutting bits off that were hanging out and flapping in the wind.  After a cross country trip, it was so balled up, it was useless and had to be thrown away.  If I have to use this carrier again, I will definitely be using some other system to keep it in place.  I do NOT know why Rightline doesn't just put a non skid bottom on the carrier itself.  That would solve the problem nicely.
B001QRTXCM|3|I bought this product but was unable to use it as it did not fit my battery post properly.  If inside and outside dimensions were clearly specified it would be helpful.
B004NEFQ9Y|5|The first of two orders- loved it so much had to order another plus one for our Harley.....Arrived early & well packaged.
B004MDCW0W|5|got it, but hooked up yet.
B00GZ20STK|5|Excellent product and company lights are bright and work great if you have any issues there customer service will help you resolve the issue
B003CKMSMS|5|Fast ship, high quality.  Perfect fit.
B0085XV9JA|2|it is Sooo small!!! and it's hard to get the lid on!
B00B7SL73I|5|Looks great and functions like it's supposed to.
B00NIHOZP8|5|Bought some 18w lights for 16 dollars, are very nice but were not bright enough for a go cart. Lit up the area in front but had to go at a creeping speed to be safe, just not bright enough. I bought these for 24 dollars and WOW, SUPER BRIGHT for a go cart. Now I can go at a safe speed and see whats out infront of me. I love these, and am thinking of buying more.
B00026Z3DQ|5|Great bang for your buck!
B0066PI154|5|Compact & effective. Does NOT flop around when you release twist / torque as pivot cam types do. This is important as you do not want the tool re-positioning itself and jamming up on surrounding structures. Since it stays locked on you want to thread the tie rod by hand until it seats then tighten clamp nuts in a position leaving some twist tighten room, 3/8&#34; drive extension room, and access room for your wrench to release clamp nuts. You will usually do better with a combination wrench or geared wrench rather than socket wrench to tighten & release clamp nuts in often tight tie rod spaces. Try to support rack against removal / install torque twist to protect pinion / rack teeth from possible damage. Before twisting off old tie rod carefully inspect and remove any locking collar, ring, pins, or other methods. Try hard to save Ford lock pins as aftermarket tie rods rarely come with the correct lock pins for anti-rotation. You may want to apply some removable thread lock compound such as Loctite blue to be extra safe. Hard to see but the U clamp is serrated just as is the clamp base to provide almost full 360 degree full circle grip. Nice. JP-USA
B00F7GZIC2|1|This decal is cheaply made and it's NOT 5&#34;. It's almost 4&#34;.
B003A1A4SY|1|The product description & specs left out the most important thing: since the hose works on gravity feed, the unit must be higher than the tank to be filled. Since the unit is very heavy when filled with 14 gallons of gas, it is almost impossible to get it higher than a tractor's gas tank, or even a lawn mower's gas tank. So, practically speaking it's a gasoline container, but worthless as a dispensing unit. Very disappointed.
B00O4Z5XOA|5|Fits perfect and didn't lose any air after two nights.
B00C5RB03W|5|Last caps fell off.  These lock in tight and have air vents also.
B0028DRABE|4|It's an original item & it works like a charm.
B004MS9VTW|4|The instructions are slightly unclear but it broke my old chain and new chain like it should. No grinding or anything. Haven't used the rivet tool as the tool that ordered my chain didn't get the press on master link.
B0094MCQW0|2|my hatchback is lowered. Perfect wording. Way too SMALL
B0036VTNGC|5|Excellent product, will buy again, but there waxes still suck.
B000GTU5EQ|5|Great product from a trusted seller
B00W81QZNK|5|Good quality parts. Some installation tips would have been nice. Delivered in a timely manner.
B006K8V7TY|5|I really like these and they fit tight so they will keep the connection clean.
B00KIPSK2M|3|Like the look, very comfortable, the problem I when down shifting it is not returning up to down shift again with out a slightly touching the heel.
B009XAQZY8|2|LED would only stay on if you continue to press the button.  Directions only accurate for South and East.  West would read as SW and N would read as NE.  At least the direction indicator moves and is fairly accurate for 2 directions.
B00W2XFY0Y|5|good service, excellent product
B00KOHHLTW|5|This is a must have for a HD pilot doing the usual performance upgrades.  I put this FP3 Autotuner on in conjunction with Vance&Hines Slash Oval Slip-ons and Arlen Ness Big Sucker Air filter kit.  The mapping for improved performance is an engineering feat I could not of dreamed of ten years ago and now it is in my hands or rather phone and tablet.  Great product and very good performance.
B0024FOTOW|5|Works great.  I wanted a one man loader that I could attach to my travel trailer hitch and this did the trick.  Removed the ball where my sway control attached and used the adaptor plate that comes with the Reese loader.  Rotate the adaptor plate towards your car and attach the vertical bar.  Couldn't be happier.  I also purchased separately brackets that attach to my roof rails that keep the canoe from shifting sideways.  Traveled at 70mph+ and the canoe never moved.
B00APS5LD8|5|good quick service and shipping. Product fit was perfect.
B0042F5ZCW|4|this is one great buy and so affordable. Every driver should have one in  their vehicle.
B000066OC7|1|So disappointed, compete waste of money. When you sit on this wedge, its like sitting on the seat below you, ;you feel nothing. !! Buying the wedge was to give support to the lower back., wrong...you get nothing. Really regret not returning to the company but I have learned a valuable lesson. Never to buy from this company again.
B00888G8FM|1|Inner bushings wore out after 11 months (9,000 miles) even though properly installed and lubed with silicone grease.  Emailed vendor (RL Racing Performance) three times and got NO RESPONSE.  WORST SERVICE EVER...
B00FNJ2QGY|1|this product will probably only fit a fiat 500, way too small for my honda civic
B00537FR08|5|Works great, keeps my balls from getting rusted.
B001LHVOVK|5|Badass! Good if you got codes. If serves its purpose. The trouble is ruling out the possibilities from the codes but it works!
B00W2XEGOO|5|These work great for my truck.
B007IPSXFO|2|After about 3 months the base started beeping out f control. I ended up throwing it away. Not to mention attaching the finders were bulky to my items.
B00GVPMTTI|4|Be sure to match the color carefully.  Took me two tries. dt
B004VDVUO2|4|Good Value
B00M6NQLBQ|5|Very good product
B002W30A4E|5|These are awesome, however, I have noticed one thing.  I have an antique Chevy pickup (well, it's from the late 50's).  I mounted the truck nuts, and within a few days I noticed that the right one was larger and hung lower than the left one.<br /><br />The only other problem I have is that they sag and when I go over a puddle they get wet.<br /><br />Is this normal?
B0018CWEQC|5|Worked perfectly on my lmm
B001OCVHMS|5|good const.
B0098QQHVI|5|Best JDM style shift knob for a 350Z
B004OXJLPE|1|Not sure what to think of this put it on my boat and it wont fire think it might have a bad ignitor so I had to order a new ignitor to see if is just that or this product.  The thing that sucks Is I wanted to replace the hole thing but they say it wont show up for 3--4 weeks who want to wait that long for a part.  Called Pertronix to run different test on it and they told me to buy a new ignitor so now im stuck spending another $ 100 to see if that is the problem.  Pertronix said they wont replace it unless I sent them the old one so they could test it after I just ran all the test they wanted to me do. NOt sure what I think.
B0013T7OL0|4|Love the cushion but the bag was ripped and the front of the cushion was damaged. Looked like a box cutter caught it.
B003CKKYS8|2|Doesnt fit 2006-11 Sportsman 500
B0000AXTUY|5|Very good battery tender. Installed under the hood of the JD and works great to keep the battery charged all winter long. Will update after the second  winter to see if I can get more than 2 years out of this battery using the tender.
B00QRANHI4|5|no more smell from litter box, plugged in 2 feet away.
B000MXYVEQ|5|Seems to work perfectly.
B00L1DET0C|2|I don't wear these goggles anymore because they are hard to clean and the UV protection is not enough. I get lots of reflection glare and sunlight directly in my eyes while riding. The quality is okay and they were comfortable to wear.
B00AQPUVUI|3|Watch out - this tire is less than $200 at most tire shops - it is worth less than $200 - did not really see any great things about this one....
B00EQQIUGK|5|I love the look and rumble of this cold air intake.  It's the second K&N I've owned, and I've had zero problems.  I'm not really sure horsepower increased much, but the sound alone makes it worth it.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|Thank Coolreall for good support and service . The battery is good ,the light very bright nice . I tested with my SUV Nissan pathfinder for jumb start ,oh! My God !!!! no problems with out battery . I charge my android phone from 15% to 100% around 3h00 it's so good. With me this one is look nice and sharp and good work . Hope so my  review help one  !
B000QUXYXE|5|great product at a great price and very easy to install - saved myself a lot of money - would whole hardedly recommend it!
B0082ACB8E|3|Great design, fits fairly well. On my truck, with the plastic bed rail covers, I have to crank it down as far as possible to get it tight. I love the trifold design, which works well whenever I need to haul something, because I can fold it back towards the cab and clip it together. It is easy to maintain and is holding up well so far. I gave it 3 stars because one of the knobs used to tighten the clamps fell off on the first day, but I can still adjust it with a wrench.
B00JEUI0OU|3|This review is for the 4-piece set with cargo liner. These mats are heavy duty, no question about it. The front and rear seat mats fit fairly well. The cargo liner is the worst part of this. The material seems thinner and more plasticky, and it does not fit the trunk area very well. There are gaps around all sides. The rearmost portion of the cargo liner is raised, perhaps to act as a sort of water/mud dam. This marginally increases the difficulty of loading, since you can't just slide stuff in. It wouldn't be so bad, except that the material is thin enough that the raised portion sort of sags. The cargo mat precludes the use of the cargo tiedown points built into the rear of the Jeep. It has squares molded in in the approximate location of the tiedown points, but they don't seem to line up properly - even if I wanted to try and cut them out. These mats do stink upon opening - I laid them out in the garage for two days to both let them off-gas and let the plastic relax after being folded in the box. My passenger front side mat was missing the Rugged Ridge badge - not that I'm a particular fan of badges and branding, but it is a fit and finish oversight.
B006TMM7AY|5|this Item fitted my car perfect and was easy to install; plus the shipping was fast, which was good since i needed it quickly. It doesn't come with a bulb so keep that in mind, but this was a good price though
B00AZPMH7Y|5|Really nice!
B000CQRN70|5|Fit right on my 07 Ranger 2wd. Had the rotors turn at Oriellys auto parts. Repacked the wheel bearings and added new dot 3 brake fluid. They stop the truck.  I got the severe because of the 105° temperatures we have in Las Vegas. And it's my daily driver.
B004GD3G3K|2|Doesn't fit completely down and flush as the oem one does on the opposite corner. They look slightly off. Oh, and the backside was razor sharp and I cut my finger sliding it out of the bubble wrap.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Mounted it on my Geo Tracker for extra storage/hauling space. Built very strong and top quality, not like the cheepos you see on the shelf at Walmart.
B00353PWAW|5|Compared to Armor All this is slightly more expensive but appears to work better. The smell is good.
B0006GK1XY|5|awesome
B004JAXF2W|4|VERY VERY GOOD, EXCELLENT
B0002Z9O7S|3|I keep these around a boat mast stored outside to organize the stays (cables). They work fine and are easy to use. They seem to weather okay so far (3 months), but the stays are wearing through pretty quickly by rubbing against the fabric during transport. The fabric is not very tough.
B00X9E0HRK|5|Works great!!!!!<br />Very well made
B000DINHE0|3|Reasonable price. Product fit.
B00IS936NI|3|I bought this bumper for $215, price has already gone up to $248.  For that price, buy the Smitty.  I had to cut and grind the bumper to get it to fit, nothing serious, but what a pain.  The Smitty looks a little better, just get that one.  You can, however, mount your winch without the $120 Smitty raised winch plate.  I used 5/8 nuts between the bumper and winch plate, cut the plate corners off, and relocated the fair lead.  Winch is mounted, works well, bumper looks OK, saved a couple bucks.  That's a win in my book.
B00V97KY90|4|Good Price and everything fit correctly. Fast Ship.
B0101A0C38|5|Looks good! Go Trump!
B00D329B8Y|5|These floor mats was heavy and very nice in my car. I love them.
B001H1Q0Z0|5|Worked for my problem...2004 Ford Freestar w traction control, as soon as I would drive away from a stop, the check traction control light would come on, and sometimes the cruise control would not work. This switch fixed that issue. Took longer to find the wrench in my toolbox than to remove and install the new switch. VERY simple install.
B00QGXXPBQ|5|better than expected; love it and on time delivery
B008QBTOSE|4|Nice size. I keep it in the glove compartment unless I am on a long trip.  Collapses easily.
B007ZDDUCK|2|Good stuff, but overpriced.  There are other leather-care products for a lot less.  This is not rocket science.
B00QK12HR2|5|It fits perfectly and looks great!
B0006O2SAK|4|It's very large.  I should have checked the measurements.  Not the small type.  Otherwise great.
B00DWVN08I|1|Keeps falling out.  Never could use it on the truck. Not work returning. just tossed it in the old toolbox.
B00S7ONHH4|1|ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR THIS PRODUCT.  IT DOES NOT WORK ON CAR AND NO HELP AVAILABLE.
B001OBYJQ0|5|Another great Kuryakyn product!
B00VLFCGKU|2|Did not fit.
B002IPQ5IG|5|Good
B00ECXSI5U|5|loved it
B0016IWT5O|5|Great job, but the part did not fit.  I had to pay postage to send it back.  But this was not their fault.
B006N94KR6|5|ok
B000C5GAQQ|5|I have a 2011 Toyota Camry. This was a perfect replacement for my lost fuel cap!
B0006GK1XY|4|Works good for small vehicles, but as it's been stated before, it will definitely not fit on a big truck or suv
B0055DQPYC|5|Excellent aesthetic upgrade with simple installation.  Removed old grips & slipped on new ones (over the throttle sleeve).
B002E5HMT6|3|not as quiet as the OEM but priced right
B0007RDVGG|5|Really good stuff. Dashboard shines like anything. I will order more as this ine is honna finish soon
B00APN8V44|4|Anybody  try disable the suspension light on 2005 model the price is right, but they can't help me with  how to turn off the light, this instructions don't work
B004NL23AC|3|I have a turbo in my Audi and would like to know the psi and what not would this show that by chance ?
B0009N30EQ|4|this works great for what I need it to.<br /><br />before a car accident I had a grid-it visor but between heat and moving things around the bands were starting to loosen and drop stuff so with my new car I wanted something more substantial that could be closed up. In comes this. the mesh pocket fits my garage door opener perfectly, I have my registration in the big zipper pocket for easy access. now.. the glasses holder is small and I think as some others suggested I will be putting pens in there instead. I was a little disappointed by the small pocket. It was kind of stuck together because it wasn't made all that great but I can get past that. Right now it's the only pocket I don't know what to do with. One day I'll have an ah ha moment and be overjoyed that something fits there.
B003LMJP4Q|5|For my Pick up. this is the best.
B006X37XGW|3|ok, they are stiff hard to use
B00KHUQAY8|2|Received it with one missing stud
B00FADDOL4|5|Pretty easy install if you know anything about wiring. I hate splicing wires! Took me a little longer than it should have. For programming it watch this video....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDJATh8Z8Ok<br />Helps a lot!
B004PGCN3C|5|Works great. Easy to install and use. Don't forget to buy the connector
B001DR9VFY|5|Great pads.
B00TP8FVK2|5|They are great and cheap they come with sooo much stuff to<br />The point where thry could charge you 100$ and still be worth it
B005GX3GFW|5|Fits like a glove on my 2014 Subaru Outback. No complaints at all!<br />Goes on easy, I mounted it at the 4oclock position, makes it easy to control the steering wheel, and turning is a breeze now.
B002N5J7WC|4|Works well
B000ALJ4U6|3|Works ok. Is about a 98% color match
B000E81VN8|4|Fits well and helped to clean up the trunk of my wife's car.
B001HBMYDW|5|These same plugs would have cost me double what I got them here for. I like to buy locally when I can, but not at that kind of mark up.
B00F671E2A|5|just as adverised, super quick delivery
B004G9VIXE|3|its OK, does the job, but breaks down quickly... already have to replace one of the two I installed.
B00F6XAO6G|5|Perfect fit on 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab
B00OFRID8K|5|works great!
B000EDQQCE|3|Works satisfactory
B007FTV9Q8|4|Great shade- thick and keeps heat out of the car. My only complaint is that the edge is a gold color and not black.
B00KW27T5A|1|Horrible did not fit my bike at all
B00EVMT6A8|5|Very &#34;original&#34; looking!
B00QQ175VO|4|Very pleased with the results I got with this product.  I have three pieces of leather furniture that took a beating from the sun.  It has brought back the soft feel and improved the look dramatically.  Great value for the money.
B00D3298A0|5|I recently ordered these for my 2003 Chevy Monte Carlo. We had the older carpet style mats, and i was getting so sick of how dirty they would get and they were so hard to clean. After looking around for a while i happened across these mats. I read all i could about them, and decided to give them a shot! I absolutely LOVE Them. I have had them in my car for a week now, and i can't believe i waited so long to order these. They really are heavy duty, and such great quality . I work in a shop and my boots tend to be very dirty at the end of the day. These mats are rubber and so easy to wipe clean, so that the dirt and grime does not transfer from my work boots to my good shoes. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for new mats, you will not be disappointed!
B00GRSOJSS|5|I use Evapo-rust mainly on automotive parts with great success.  On heavily rusted items, it does help to remove the heavy rust with a brush as Evapo-rust works and then continue soaking.<br /><br />I have de-rusted brake rotors which allowed me to repaint them and use them again since they were in good condition other than being rusted.
B0024E6V30|5|we have a lot of sand in the water at our campground. These filters do a great job.
B0096UAZ1O|5|works well
B004QEJ6CO|5|Very strong and durable but I returned due to usible length. If you need about 40&#34;  this was my favorite.
B0063RK96Y|5|Worked perfectly on my 2002 Jeep Liberty.
B00BYH6C1E|1|Must be a U.S. thing to feed on fries, fumble with the cell phone and count your change while you should be paying attention on where you are going. Was witness to an accident in Texas, where 2 young girls driving directly ahead of me died - killed by an oncoming semi-trailer combo while having Lunch behind the wheel. Smarten up.
B008PK3MA2|5|It work and look the same as old one but newer.
B004RI4IG8|3|Don't really fit my Scion Tc but still uses it.
B000H8XKVG|1|Wrong size, will not fit, this could have been avoided if dimension were offered
B00292WNRA|5|Beautiful!!!!!!!!
B000BN85YY|5|its great
B00HUM606Y|5|Great fits as promised
B0000AY9W6|5|Cheap and it works
B00C3NA1GA|5|I love it
B004C6I6LI|5|Great quality, looks fantastic. Very happy. Made in USA!
B000GTV7HA|5|exactly what i asked for
B000GOG3P6|5|An exact match to the OEM part that finally failed.<br />Great price, quick delivery and I again have air blowing in my car.<br />This was installed in a 97 Dodge Grand Caravan SE<br />Because of the location, it is difficult to remove and replace but anyone with a few tools, access to YouTube and patience should be able to do it themselves.
B00DWVN08I|5|Love it works great.
B00KTHYCEO|5|Works as advertised. Just make sure to follow the online directions to the letter!
B001DRNO4I|5|As described.
B004FFGKLE|5|Quality product. Everything you need
B005MZXA5A|5|Love this...Keep one on our van at all times.
B000CIQL9Y|5|great buy
B0051I9IYK|5|Been going strong since I got them. Just be sure you don't switch the polarity when plugging it in. Had me confused for a hot minute.
B001CAW2DK|5|Stop stale fuel
B005Q0S1ZA|4|The head rest cover didn't fit very well but overall happy with the product protecting my seats.
B00W25YZVG|5|Worked perfectly,awesome!!!
B00NQ8E90K|5|Used this for my &#34;Big 3&#34; upgrade in my 2010 Honda Civic. The terminal work incredibly well, very durable.
B003ZUMLZ4|5|good fit
B00C4ON3OU|5|Works
B00KTHZJ1O|4|It's working correctly on my 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee, I had to go to the Jeep Dealer since I have just one Key, but this replacement is working great.
B00YJWYZOM|5|These match my old peer perfectly. I haven't install these on my bike yet so I'll fallow up with this review
B00JH0KEDW|5|Works great!  Took it right out and washed my rear window.  Cleaned up nice and fast with no streaks that I could see.
B00K1C1WC2|5|They work as described.
B00EAOIKVI|4|Kind of hard to put in my maxima, but that is not the filters fault.  The only thing I do not like about it is that it looks dirty already, I cannot wait for every time I go to the dealership and to have them tell me I need to give them $60 to replace it because it is dirty even though it is not dirty.  But no matter, I do most maintenance myself when I can.  I guess I am old school and just like a white filter.
B005OXVO5S|1|I replaced this part and within two months it stopped working.
B001TJWO4Q|4|Spray and walk away.  Not sure how much protection it offers but it makes the plastic look shiny like tire dressing..at least for a while
B007TY0G1I|4|Great product, easy to install. Only reason for not rating at 5 stars is they could use a little piece of double stick adhesive to put in the gap where the 2 pieces meet. Other than that it is a perfect fit and looks great!
B001OMLE4E|4|very good fitting cover, tough an durable. thanks.
B00RE6KV48|1|I have a faux leather sleeper sofa.  It's a two seater.  I'm not big on a lot of furniture so this is the only couch that I have.<br /><br />I purchased this sofa back in May 2011.  It took a while to arrive but it did.  I barely sat on this.<br /><br />My brother-in-law who's not happy with his marriage have been coming over to my apartment A LOT!!!<br /><br />I weigh 143 and he weighs a little over 200lbs.  Since he's been coming over A LOT I've been sitting on my sofa more than I usually do.  With my weight and his my couch has been coming apart.  I asked a question on whether this will repair faux leather and someone told me it does.<br />With all the positive reviews I decided to get this.<br /><br />All I can say is money wasted.  This does give my couch a shine but it doesn't repair it.  So my couch has shiny patches.  It's very noticable.  It makes the eye wander to the peeling faux leather.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Quite possibly the coolest car accessory on the market - if you love Star Wars!  The unit itself appears to be of decent quality (it's a bit small for my vehicle, but looks cool, anyway) and the color has stayed true even in the brutal Colorado sunshine.  I bought two more as gifts, if that's an indication of how much I enjoyed the product.
B005FK8UNO|5|well now i can honestly say that i can stop on a dime. Low cost great quality
B004I12424|4|Pros:<br />- Almost exact match to the factory light that didn't break.  Just a bit off in regards to the placement of the white area.<br />- Nice color.  Color matches to the factory light.<br />- Fit was perfect, no troubles installing it myself.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None!
B00029X5WO|1|Save your money they do not work. I put them on and after the first rain they drug across the windshield so bad I had to replace them with the cheapest pair from my local auto parts store and they work great.
B003BGYRPO|4|Good
B005KT3CQU|5|fits my 2006 X5 perfectly
B000E65NHK|5|A direct replacement for my 1996 Dodge Ram 2500 CTD headlight switch. It seems that trucks from this era are famous for burning out the contacts of the OEM switch. It took me about 20 minutes to install it. The hardest part was removing the knob pigtail from the old switch to reuse on the new one. Watching an installation video on your favorite video website will be well worth your time. My new switch works perfectly.
B00KXU0XQS|5|I sleep better on this mattress then the one in the house!
B000J2I7T0|4|I am always putting my makeup on in the car from a couple small cosmetic bags, and constantly loosing the blush or whatever after getting it out of the bag to locate the next thing I'm trying to find to put on.  It ends up on the floor or underneath me or something.  This is very handy.  I put it behind the driver's seat when I'm not using it, then when I go to use it I swing it over to the side to use each cosmetic item when I need it.  I just keep it filled so it's always ready for my weekly 5 hour road trips.  This has been a life saver.
B00REZ53YM|5|Looks great on my Golf MK6; very bright, vivid yellow light. The yellow bulb causes the reflector to appear yellow even when the light is off, too. The first set I received had one dead bulb, but DC sent a replacement free of charge. Replacement worked perfectly.<br /><br />I've only had them installed for a few days as of this review, so no comment on longevity yet.
B00WGWKQ5Y|5|great
B009S4SYP2|4|gauge work fine
B0042H8TV4|5|Great Product
B008VN1LZQ|1|Worked great for 3 months and then it went out. Very cheap and obviously doesn't last. I recommend spending a little more money and getting one that lasts longer than 3 months.
B000EDQQJM|4|This is for the guys out there.  Follow the instructions to mount the support bracket and this will be a quick and easy install.
B00GT1WZXE|5|Great product, looks great on my GMC Sierra 1500. Took a few hours to instal, but very doable. I just need to find a good GMC emblem to add.
B004YLN5LC|1|To my knowledge the details are suppose to exactly what you receive. Negative. I am missing the steering wheel cover plus the two seatbelt pads. Thats considered fake advertisement. I dont care who the manucfacture is, is the sellers responsibility to have everything sent. You got your payment. But i didnt receive what i expected.
B0084BL2TK|5|Installation was a breeze. . 5 minutes and you just added serious flash n flare! Must go all LED of course and its not a perfect fit so be prepared to go to you're local auto zone and get some clear silicone to seal the gaps. Overall ... Bad Ass!
B00NB5N6A2|1|Broken just only three months
B00QFOAYHE|5|Good quality and they fit my 2009 Audi A4 (non s-line) perfectly!
B005WXMVQG|1|Silicone at top of sock burned my leg after a long day of riding. I threw away!
B00DGVJC04|5|Just like original !!
B003UMRC06|5|Great
B0070Y35OC|4|Just like that said nice tint I did mess up my own back window at the last second trying to make it perfect  how ever the side windows where a breeze
B00LIRVV2K|1|they mounted fine to my 01 dodge it when i turned them on i only get one halo light on and both high beam lights where blown. it was a disappointment to spend the money on nothing in return but some blown bulbs.
B007N6OWGM|4|Items arrived on time and in semi-good condition (box looked like it had been open and re-taped). Installed on a 2006 Nissan Xterra after the old ones conked out at 115,000 miles. My car feels like new again- ride is so much smoother and going over speed bumps and potholes are less jarring.<br />Only had them on for 2 months so I've only rated them 4 stars - will update in about 6 months.
B00029KC2K|1|Attempted using this to protect an ABS plastic motorcycle fairing from exhaust heat. The reflective material seems OK, and the adhesive backing sticks well to my fairing when the surface is properly cleaned and prepped. However, the reflective material is poorly bonded to the adhesive backing. The adhesive stays attached to the bike just fine, but the reflective material separates from the adhesive and falls off within a few hundred miles. Found another brand that seems to hold up better and doesn't separate from the adhesive.
B00MRNVO0S|5|Exactly as described, works quite fine for what I need and am pleased to have it.
B0031GUEQK|5|New clutch fixed my a/c problem.  Fits great, no problem with fan clearing wires like some brands.
B000CLSPWW|5|No need for Bake Quiet Fluid
B007IQFJ5U|5|it  works great I love it my friend thinks  its cool to
B003SEBYF0|1|11/8/2016<br /><br />Buyers beware of duing business with HORNBLASTERS.<br />They don't value customers, only sales. They don't understanc customer service!<br /><br />Thank you Stebel engineering for stepping up to the plate!!<br /><br />Awesome sound! Hopefully lasts longer than what others have posted. Love that it gets drivers attention who aren't alert of motorcycles because they are too busy on their cell phones.<br /><br />November 2016 update:<br />Completely disappointed!!! After only have for 5 months, quit working, only blows air out, unless you grab the inside of the horn vent, then it works when it wants tooooo!!!<br />Unreliable and UNSAFE! Gonna cause an accident, when you can't warn someone that their about to hit you!!!!!
B00809W470|5|The best
B00R9IMKYK|4|Works as advertised.  Will buy again. Kids love it.
B00AQ29FOY|5|Great product for the price.
B00BVTHXUY|5|great quality , looks great on my avenger .. love it , highly recommend
B0083YSNTU|2|I used this trim in other areas. They did nou fit the contour of my truck wheel well.  Gary
B0060YJFXS|5|Direct fit for 08 Lancer es with rear drum brakes
B00BQVF1ZG|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B00COE3ZHA|4|Fit my 2011 Honda Pilot without any trouble. Seems to be doing its job so far.
B0006SH4NC|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B001G97DKY|5|My 1967 Impala rides better, handles better, no more roll while cornering, no more bottoming out, the back end is raised up, it looks great! This is an excellent investment, and easy to install. Thanks!!!
B000OZTPIY|5|Fit perfit love your products for my Landmaster LM400.Thanks
B00HD50BEK|4|Get an awesome interior glow.  They work like a charm, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is the adhesive was a little difficult to apply. (Sticky tabs you put onto the back of the units)
B00DL1EWZ4|4|Good item but just a little larger then the original.
B001B0VP3E|5|Ordered this for a 2008 wrangler unlimited x. Fits great & looks awesome. Some of the inserts don't click right in so a little extra pressure is needed then you can feel that 'click' but they all snapped in just fine!
B008R1DQW8|5|Have used Rejex for over a decade.  When cured, it's hard and durable.  Even in through the winter, the water will bead up for 6 months.  Great shine too.
B010H0QV00|5|Useful tool. Comes preinstalled with batteries. (you have to remove the small plastic wraps that protect batteries in store). There is a lock also which makes knoves/scissors not to open up. Once you unlock they are accessible. Tried air pressure on couple of tires and cross checked with my existing guages. They were very close. I was provided a sample to review.
B008I7QTI4|5|This is an awesome product, has the defrost sign, no warp in glass, fits perfect. I would purchase from this vendor again.
B005NLQAHS|4|Car totaled is accident and product lost in wreck.  worked good for a short time.
B0002SRF6C|5|Nice tool

B00QG3GP68|5|We used this product on our brand new at it worked great<br />I would buy them again.
B00JINPJD8|5|Keeps dirt on the bottom. Fits my bucket that I got for O'Reilys. Does what it's suppose to do! Not sure what else you want.!
B00G9DNEOQ|5|2013 F350 Super Duty Crew Cab, they fit perfect, are easy to install and look and feel solid. I would definitely recommend these, and at 160 dollars , good deal.
B001PYG900|5|worked
B0066FDGQS|2|Product not as shown, the cut out of horse ie not there and mounting system is week leaving bar unstable and flimsy. Would not recommend.

B00PFWN8NY|5|great item
B004804NV0|5|Very sturdy good price too
B001B3ZVBI|5|do two coats it look amazing shine crazy before u even clear coat
B001CIA0OK|5|Used this on my 2014 Ram Cummins for my gravity fed auxiliary tank, works good so far.
B00B2ATTUE|4|Expensive, but works Great.  For wide stance trailer  this chock really helps to stop movement. It would be nice if it was sold in a 2 pack like their other product.
B00E5YNOWI|4|Solved personal storage problem with new car
B00AYCLB70|5|Same if not better than OEM quality. Highly suggested!
B0016J3W90|4|good replacement
B0006HMD98|4|In the description it says it does not fit a 2015 Honda Accord,but I called the company and it fits perfectly.<br />The package came boxed with plenty of protective bubble wrap.A+<br />I was expecting a little heavier cast frame like the Honda OEM frames I was also considering,but they were definitely a step up from my local auto stores.B<br />The finish was nice but seems to smudge too easily.B<br />All in all I'm happy,but for 30 bucks I would have liked a slightly heavier duty frame with a little better finish.
B00OVBBPOO|5|Well built, great price and perfect fit ! A++++
B000ALJ4NS|5|I've tried a bunch of different 5min epoxies, and this is the best epoxy. It really is crystal clear is why I like it so much.<br />Hint1: After each use, before replacing the cap, pull back on the plunger a bit to get rid of excess epoxy coming out the ends, and only then put the cap on.<br />Hint2: When you put the cap back on, you really need to push hard to click it back on... just grab the whole tube and press down upside down on a table 'til you hear the cap click in place.
B004UM6DLE|4|This stuff is pretty neat,  my truck has 8000 miles on it. Spray this on and watch it find the embedded metal in your paint job.  Makes you feel good about the results.
B00KWLKVSI|2|plugs came in a plastic bag and all 3 plugs were mushed.had to regap, hope they work.
B000FW61EW|5|I used it to re-adhere the rear window on my 2005 Mustang GT/CS. Step Primer I also used 3M 08682 Single Step Primer after alcohol prepping the glass. I did it in March and it is now August and still holding. We have had multiple rains, many days over 100F degrees (Texas Heat) and I put the top up and down multiple times a day and everything is still in tact. I have even taken it through multiple car washes to put it to the test and still no leaks.<br /><br />As others have said, the key is to take your time and allow for full cure. I was also able to find a clamp that uses a suction cup on the glass to pull the glass and top material together very tightly. They are typically sold 6 to a pack for around $30 and are typically used to hold windshield molding, trim, badges to the automobile while the adhesive cures. Here are a few I found....[the one I used] Molding hold down tool (gtglass.com), suck on clamp (btbtool.com), suction clamp set (ariestools.com).<br /><br />I paid for the 3M Urethane, 3M Primer and two sets of the clamps, let my car sit in my garage for 72 hours and it was tons cheaper than any quote from a window/convertible top repair company (most say the only way to fix it is to replace the whole top). Win for DIY'ers....thanks 3M and Amazon community feedback under this product.
B00PXZ919I|5|This is the best polishers with the latest technology which provides sufficient power and stable rotation but a little less noise. Espeically the power indicator is helpful to know where I am and the brand seems to be reliable.
B00QSW3LRS|5|Update 1: ~1 Month of use:<br />Rather sure the AZ sun will make the paint fade within 1 year of use, but these levers feel light, yet solid.<br />They are a great addition to my FZ8.<br /><br />It's worth the wait (due to shipping).
B009EA1WDQ|5|OEM part so does the job it's supposed to do. No issues with this whatsoever
B000I04Z7Q|5|They work really good and look really nice in your car and love all the different options
B004KSN36Q|5|Nice key chain! My husband loves it!
B000YS9P54|4|I only use the cooler side but is great for 6 drinks
B007KP51E8|4|good sticker. glad I visited the park
B004I10E3K|1|After spending 30 minutes installing and stop lamp quit working the next day. Have to move it to work for minutes at a time .  Tried new socket and bulb( $12.00) and lasted a minute then out again. You can shop around and spend $35.00 more for OEM that should work like factory model. Same thing my old unit was doing but it lasted 8 years. It did fit fine and looks the same (from outside) for those who still want to try it.
B007R4UCW8|5|These sprayers work very well.  I love that they are easy on the fingers if you are doing a lot of spraying.  I will buy again.  I spray ants and weeds with 20% vinegar.  That is very hard on most spray bottles.  These hold up very well.
B0009IK5VC|2|Good only for a spare, not worth the $$ paid.
B002FOO8BG|5|The plugs were an exact match for my sister's car. The cost was about 40% less than buying local. Thank You. Your forever customer Brian Taylor
B00MRWNHT0|1|Not as bright as factory bulb, do not recommend .
B00B7ORHNG|5|Great
B00UPH3OYM|5|Decal is awesome. A little larger than what I had thought, but the cuts are sharp and it looks absolutely great!  No regrets here!<br />Basically clean the area, remove the backing, put it on whatever you are sticking it on and then use a plastic scraper or credit card to get it nice and secure and then peel off the backing.  Worked great, and would order again.  Thanks!
B000JFL7ZS|5|Perfect  fix oil change home is more easier
B00DNDBJVK|2|I wish that these mats were slightly bigger. They are constantly bending and do not stay planted. Not very happy with these.
B006JRQEYY|4|Will fit a 2014 Ram 1500 Express with a little trimming and bolting left hook on right side and right hook on left side. The hooks just fit through the Express bumper better when open side is facing in. Bolts on fine this way and I see no problem with it.
B0041DX7ZM|2|Replaced this part in 2013, already broke in June 2015. would I order it again? No way. Besides the part, I have to eat the labor to replace it as well. Oh well, learn a lesson to read reviews and order quality parts.  Update*** Called TYC/Genera, for the product's lifetime warranty per their site. They would not honor the warranty replacement to the customer. So I called amazon CSR they were kind enough to refund the cost. So 10 stars for amazon and 1 star for TYC/Genera Manufacturer.
B00EGFJ30I|4|Good quality product. There are quite a potion of the bottom of the license plate was blocked though.
B008UFPROG|4|it genuine alright. so easy to change. why have a dealer charge you $$$ for something so simple
B00C4H2YXI|5|Perfect fit for attaching the lower air foil to the bumper of a 2002 GMC Yukon.  Note:  Squeeze together until you hear or feel a snap.  It will not hold tight or secure until it is locked in.<br />Another note:  My bumper is a replacement that came from a cheap knockoff store.  Looks great, but... two of the square holes seemed to be too big.  Turns out that when they stamped it out, it curved the edges of these square hole upward. I was able to use some vise grip pliers to flatten out the edges of the square holes.  Once I did that, the insert fit well enough to hold securely.
B008LOOB4I|3|Holy small
B00UICM85K|5|Great
B002VGDAR6|4|Good performance for the $.  Slightly noisier than stock, but other then that working fine.
B003YMRO3W|5|Perfect...excellent quality and fit.
B004ROPQ2C|5|Good
B00A0SF6VK|5|I love these. They make building computers much easier.
B00192JGA8|5|very solid adapter
B007USCM7E|5|Easy to use by yourself no mechanic needed
B0033Z18TQ|1|Trash.trash I got a duraflex bumper for my 2014ss and wasted time and money body shops wont even touch it looks like stevie wonder made this product..Do your self a favor and avoid anything duraflex..
B00KTIVHLY|2|Easy to program, but the red is more hot pink than red and your friends will mock you.
B00NU0BSIA|3|This spray smells great, but doesn't last more than a couple days.  Very disappointing.  I've used it in the work van, the car, the truck, everywhere.  I don't understand how it disappears so fast.
B0002MACJ0|5|Works great for my roof rack. Has plenty of hooks to secure lighter/smaller items
B009OEM40C|5|the  cup holders in my 2015 ram 1500 come out easy with a large drink. I guess one came out on bottom of a cup and I lost it. this is an exact replacement . hope this helps
B0013CP8T2|5|Got them as spares
B00DW6S6VE|4|Love the look and ease of putting them on.
B00MWNZ4LS|1|These wiper blades do not maintain good contact with the windshield, particularly at highway speeds. Not Recommended.
B00BJ4EF0C|5|Works on a 1998 ford ranger w/o issue.
B009BNFW5K|1|On the picture, and as I read the details, I was supposed to receive valve caps with wolves on them. Instead, ones with little green frogs on them showed up. When I tried to replace and return the item, no feedback was given. I'm still waiting to return them.
B000K02EDG|5|Worked great.
B0023VDQ46|5|A+ works and looks great..fast shipping low price
B00WDSVEE8|5|This clip-on does exactly what it's designed to do. Fits great and is really great for hiking!
B001NY3158|5|Fast shipping and handling and items fit exactly on my rav4.
B00496XHCE|1|Bought this for my 2000 GMC Sierra SL v6 in April 2015 It's not a daily driver,as I work out of the house.I use it to go to the store,and run errands maybe twice a week.I replaced the fuel filter,pick up coil,plugs/wires,and cap,computer,and the fuel pump.  I bought this Autobest fuel pump...  April 9th 2015,Died July 28th 2015...About 1000 miles left me on the side of the road...  Excuse my little rant here... Anyone reading this probably knows,it's not a part located on the vehicle with easy access to replace it often.It's supposed to last 75k,100k,150k  miles,most people will buy and sell a vehicle without replacing the fuel pump.So after replacing the fuel pump the 1st time using the tilt bed method,I chalked it up as an experience,I've changed a fuel pump before.Shocked,and in a bit of disbelief that 4 months later I'd be having the experience again.  Amazon has been great in help with the situation,as always
B00HFWY4P8|5|Purchased this for my girlfriend. She had a half helmet, and complained of wind noise and dust in her eyes. She didn't want a full face helmet. So I purchased this. No more wind noise. The pull down visor is great for keeping dust out. She gets a lot of compliments on how it looks.
B008DH3BC6|1|Way too big...very disappointed
B005VPS2UO|5|Exelent fits in 2002 passat 1.8 Turbo
B0000AY2Z6|2|Moved a LOT of air but just too noisy for a small camper. Had to return it.<br />Also, as others mentioned, the swing out feet are very fragile and loose.<br />Manufacturer should redesign the feet so people who don't mind the noise might consider keeping it for the excellent air flow it creates.
B00896SKXQ|2|Looked great until a car wash started to peel the paint.
B00U88T1A4|4|This is a great product and price the lights flash super bright (6K look) and look good when in use. The only minor problem is that every time of starting my car I always get a error message on the dashboard, once I turn on my hazard light for about 5 seconds the error message goes away. But over all happy with the bulbs.
B0009JKI2W|3|The product itself feels nice and looks nice but ripped at the bottom just before I finished putting it on my wheel.
B004I665XS|5|We use these in the museum's emergency cart to deal with leaks, spills, and other hazards.  It's highly absorbent, and takes up very little room.
B00062YSPK|5|Excellent made project. Worked very well with my stroker engine to switch to tbi. Will be buying this again
B004QEKGA0|5|This is a great product and easy to assemble.  Very sturdy! We use it for our Yeti 160 and believe me we load it down.
B004TO0VLG|1|Clamps are not the size they say they are in the posting.
B001JT7B3U|1|I got this for my jeep as a replacement after I broke my 3 foot whip<br />When I got it you could tell it was a older package and had some damage to packaging but was hopeful that it would be fine<br />And installed this and all I get is static and can't get anyone nor can anyone hear me we tested it out several times with others in my group<br />And I tried a friends whip and it worked out this one back on and got nothing<br />Waste of money<br />I'm very displeased with it
B005LL4G0S|5|I got this for my son as part of an armor upgrade for protection for crashes during downhill mountain biking. He is tall and thin and many chest/back protectors don't fit. This is adjustable and fit very well. It is light and airy so vents well for hot weather. It has also been designed to let you remove a small amount of armor at both the front and back so a neck brace like the Leatt GPX 5.5 fits perfectly. It is well made and I have seen him take some pretty good falls with a slide and just get up, dust off and take off again. This is a great part of a full armor kit.
B008G32GQE|1|Unless you are capable of modifying these handles, do not waste your time or money.  The mechanism that moves the latch arm slips.  It has so much free play in it, that it would not engage the latch.  What I ended up having done, is disassembling this part and modifying my existing handle with the part I needed.  Fortunately for me, the only part that I actually needed in order to make my door functional, was the actual moving handle itself.  This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever ordered.  I don't expect this part to last very long after reading the other reviews about it.  But, for now my door is functional.  What should have taken 30 minutes to install, took over 2 hours.  I have worked in a body shop for over 20 years so I know a little bit about how to R & I a dang door handle, and my boyfriend is very mechanically inclined.  He is the one who rescued me in this situation.
B001TAJXXA|5|My 04 Cherokee looks new again.  Fit perfect!  I am very happy with the product!  10 minutes to put them in.
B00E9QTEWG|3|They are comfortable on the foot, but if you have big calves like me (18.5&#34;), they are extremely tight.
B004X1UBUQ|4|Excellent seller , very fast shipping , Item as described , Thanks! ♥~♥♥~♥♥~♥
B002E1AYKY|4|serve the purpose..
B003AT8HVC|5|Worked great for our vehicle and our camper to where we can put our bike rack on too.
B00HCVRPY4|5|I've had these multiple times, keeping two in each car hanging off the front seats.  It is so nice to have a place to hang bags, especially plastic ones.  Also, your purchases don't roll all over the car.
B00MUFTH6Q|5|Adds comfort to your car headrest.  These are very cute, very kawaii.  Great quality materials and stitching.  Design is cute too.
B00TCKM9I0|2|The product came with scratches a little dirty and the smell was really strong. I put it on anyway but it didn't glue to the door I had to add super glue to it which makes it even more dirty.
B005ICNQBK|5|Fit my 2014 ram 1500 quad cab perfect. Easy installation. Fast shipping. Quality product.
B00ICTDZM6|1|WARNING DOES NOT FIT HONDA CRF 150R LIKE AS ADVERTISED !
B003EAW57E|5|As you've probably read in the other reviews, it DOES darken the leather pretty significantly, so beware. That said, it works just as it is described to do so. Love the handy applicator built into the cap, although you would like to make sure to squeeze a good amount off at the opening because it holds A LOT of oil! Keep in mind.<br />Used in conjunction with Fiebings Saddle Soap.
B000WEMH4G|5|easy hook up work great well made.
B00AIILN8C|1|Arrived broken
B005R4KZ1I|1|Relieved my package on time. Looked good right outta the box. Hooked them up on my 1997 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 and they didn't fit properly. Had to modify the inside of where the light goes with a hammer. Back of light was touching the body. After installing them and testing them they worked fine until a few days later my passenger side started smoking!! Black smoke! I took of the tail light to find the wiring harness chard to a crisp! Very disappointed! buyer beware!
B007Z4XJ7A|4|Looks great and easy to install.  It took a very long time to get to me and I think that the customs should have been included in the price as it is very expensive.  I would feel better too, if it attached better than two way tape.  I hope it doesn't come off.
B004ZF3ZGC|5|Great product. I use these for my headlight high beams. Makes a world of difference. 6000k color keeps it looking like OEM lights.
B00KTI0E6I|5|They work great! I had one working remote that was falling a part so I removed the electronics and transferred it to the new one. Just like new again and I still have backup parts.
B00LPSEPVG|1|This is very flimsy and already had lose threads on one of the side pockets when I received it. I was going out on a road trip the next morning after having received it so I used it anyway but I was extremely disappointed about it's quality. You sure get what you pay for.
B00LHUI4XM|5|very nice just what I wanted for the car
B000VKZNCY|3|The way it's made leaves sharp and big edges. Hard to put in the oxygen sensor and the heat shield because of the edges. Watch the sharp edges so you don't cut your CV boot.
B0041U3LIS|5|Perfect replacement
B000C5CEKC|5|Perfectly fit both of my cars and easy to lock and unlock.  Great purchase and fast delivery.
B008HY2ZOA|1|They are not what is shown in the picture.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as advertised
B000T90D7C|5|Easy to install. Product works great.
B000CCG082|4|Good but not polished like pic
B007Y87V94|5|It came when expected and was as advertised and now it is on the vehicle and doing what it is supposed to do.  And I liked the price.
B00OFU33PU|5|Perfect for the back of my Mazda CX-7. Keeps my groceries from rolling around the back, and folds up small when not in use.
B00JAXXD2U|5|great battery spins the Harley over faster than the stock battery
B00RD4D9AO|5|fits perfect on a 2015 rogue. no need to do anything with the muffler, a second pair of hand for a few minutes and we got it installed in 20 minutes
B00IPEF3QE|4|Love them, they stay on the seat well. I would've given the product a 5, but they slip as you get in and out. Not slipping off, just skipping on the seat. My mother slid out of the vehicle one day :)
B000C55T7W|2|Before installing check the air connections on your current shocks. Monroe uses a clip and o-ring. GM uses a threaded compression fitting. Converting one style to the other may be problematic. If your car has the threaded compression fitting it may be easier to install the AC Delco  OEM shocks especially if you have a auto leveling system with built in compressor.
B00HD9TCFU|5|I ordered this to save money. It fit perfect. My husand installed it without much trouble, just took about 1 hr. but well worth it! Works perfect. We're painting it to match CR-V silver paint.
B00NRLCN7W|5|50 + hp gain. My life has been forever changed.
B00065L2D8|4|Works great.
B00KZD8JV4|1|The logo and color fades after 2 months, waste of money
B00X123OPC|3|It appeared larger than it really is
B00VA1XJ1A|5|[[VIDEOID:df9775b8d93bcf5094954737aae3d54f]]These Cartman cleaning cloths are made with qaulity.  Most of the time when you get a cleaning cloth it is a junk rag these rags are nice.  The edges are stitched. It is very soft to the touch this rag would not mess up any electronics. I used this one my LED TV and it did not leave any streaks or lint. Another crazy thing about this rag it that it will hold up to 8 times its weight and you can rinse and reuse.  When you buy these you get a 30 pack the rags measure 14' x 14'. I would recommend this rag!<br />this product was given to me for free in exchange for an unbiased review
B000CI8Y1C|5|worked
B00BQS8Q4W|5|Seems solid. Haven't installed it yet though.
B00WMKWUCW|5|Great price save your money and buy this coil
B00B1SAL54|5|A very nice thermostat.
B001QR00RE|4|They fit pretty well, but not perfect. The ends of the C could have been a little longer and the B and R are more rounded than the bumper.
B000GTXQLA|5|Would buy from this seller anytime a need a new set of cables for my H-D Motorcycle!
B000BWAOWG|4|Fit like a glove! Fast shipping is what I needed and that's what we got.
B006QLLO52|1|Did not receive part shown in picture. Instead it was a plain looking one.
B007NMJO8M|4|It is of a real good quality.
B00RW54JCG|5|Fits perfectly in my truck and now I don't have to worry about leaving stuff back there for people to see. I can cover it now
B000A2N7K8|5|Easy to adhere to the window. Keeps accurate temperature and easy to read.
B00VW0JE3Q|5|No reception loss, mounted perfectly to my 2015 Sierra. Rock solid and looks OEM but shorter.  Great product!  EDIT: After noticing whistling sound coming from passenger windshield area at speeds over 65mph, diagnosed to be antenna causing problem. Removed and problem goes away.  Will have to go back to factory antenna. :-(
B00C33EZ1W|5|Fast shipping! Great looks!
B00KWNSE6M|3|Nice
B001B5CU74|2|I purchased this for my TJ wrangler 1998.  The pressure plate did not exactly match the specs of my original.  It was thinner and I had to use my original and pair it with the clutch disc.  Clutch disk was fine.  The combination of the old clutch pressure plate and the new clutch disk worked well
B00DBNF756|5|finishing touch to hub caps
B000N8GUFS|1|motor mounts are thin metal, cheep cheep cheep, the plates are decent
B00R6RQFTA|5|Was looking to replace the broken passenger side mirror on my daughter's Saab. Searched the internet and all auto replacement dealers had this priced from $ 129 to $ 179 just for the mirror. This worked great-easy to install-fit perfectly, and can't beat the price. Will check Amazon always first now.
B000NVW1LM|1|It didn't work in my differential, made the leak worst.
B004W5SGBO|5|Nice heavy gauge plastic.  A bit bigger than I had anticipated but gave me some extra room to mount an on/off toggle for disconnecting battery when not in use on my camper.
B0065FRBZ6|5|Very pleased with this. Amazing tool pouch. I ise it for gloves, glasses, extra bandanas. Seems very well made. Looks and feels very sturdy.
B006F903VQ|5|Product and customer were fantastic.  I would buy from Powersport Parts again.
B0091OE6K6|5|At last! After years of trying clothes pins, chip clips and various other jerry-rigged items to keep the seat belt off my neck and off my chest, I am so happy to find a product that actually works! And it stays in place, doesn't interfere with the belt function, and someone else using the same seat belt can just ignore it. I combined mine with a real sheepskin seat belt cover for my neck and I am (finally!) a happy camper. Thank you!
B007Y5QT4K|5|EXACTLY WHAT MY DAD NEEDED TO FIX HIS BIKE. WORKS GREAT! EXTREEMLY FAST SHIPPING! WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS SUPPLIER :)
B0009JKGJC|5|very good product especially on old chrome and great value at $2.47 as &#34;add-on&#34; item.
B001NI7KE2|3|Poor design; it falls off in my car all the time.
B001EA0LVS|5|These are a simple solution to my wife bashing the doors in on my S63's aluminum door panels and costing $200 to fix each time.
B000CMJ2OG|3|Paint comes off easy.
B0040CTUAA|5|Works on 2004, 350z. Worked as intended.
B004YJTVKI|4|First time strut replacement went well. Plenty of online assistance and You tube videos to guide you thru. Will follow up later to see how the struts hold up over time. Lift was about 1.5 inches with the before and after measurements. Had trouble getting the units delivered kept getting defective units or missing hardware.  Amazon came thru and even had items overnighted to help me out.
B00MHJOFVM|3|Color does not match exactly the chrome color bumper trim on the 2015 model, but from far away it looks okay. It also looks like it has a few ripples in the manufacturing, and it came with chips in the end. Product was not perfect. Also the edges are rounded, so it doesn't match up perfectly with the bumper shape. Otherwise it serves it's purpose so the bumper doesn't get scratched.
B00VHMJRI6|4|So far so good. Hooked up to an edge unit just fine then to a pioneer deck also works well. Night vision is ok as well. No complaints.
B00180JEAI|5|Sturdy replacement compared to the stock end link. Simply removed the wheel, removed old end link and bolted this one up to torque spec. Got rid of pesky clunking sound due to worn out old part.
B00KEW4WE4|4|These fit our 2014 Escape fairly well.  They serve their purpose well, a lot less road grime gets on the sides and back of the car now.  Mounting hardware could be better, but they haven't fallen off, so I guess it works.
B005QOF9QU|5|Arrived quicker then expected. Fit right into my 40 amp Eastwood Plasma Cutter.
B0007OWD0Y|5|Got it at a good price, couldn't find it in any retail store!
B000EVU8C0|4|Comes with code reader. Don't buy Haynes code reader like they recommend.
B003AL23TC|5|Seems to work well. Did everything it was supposed to do. No issues at the campground.
B00V30J86I|5|excellent product. I keep all my emergency medicine and they are readily accessible. very easy and user friendly to install.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|These wipes leave a new look to your dashboard!  How cool is that?
B001U7E116|5|Work great. Good fit.
B00IKZTRLA|5|The product is great
B0000V0EB4|5|Just love this napkin holder. Fits perfectly under my cabinet. Now I have more space on my counter. Will order other stuff in the near future.
B000C9WJHQ|5|Fit my 1992 miata perfectly
B00514A2KS|5|Worked well. I had extended my controls and the longer shift linkage that came with th kit I bought was kind of cheesy so this was perfect to use my original linkage
B00FV1MMT0|1|They really should have tried these out a little more because they really don't work that good on the Chevy Trax driver and passenger windows. I broke the one on the driver's side and the passenger side catches when you try to put it up.
B00NLOA3VI|5|Fit perfectly
B00UL7DQG2|5|FITS YAMAHA FZ1S 2007
B00JI9JLWM|5|Headlights came well packaged, very solid, no cracks, chips, or broken or missing pieces. Everything was well put together, adjusters worked great, I sprayed them with wd-40 as suggested just in case. I can't speak as to the fitment in the listed vehicle as I purchased these to do a headlight conversion on a third gen camaro but they were a nice product at a great price.
B00U5G8KE2|5|Exactly what I wanted. Easy to install and used the original tail light, turn signals, license plate light and grab handles. no cutting or splicing wires.
B00ETGQ29E|5|Fit in my car perfectly!!
B000E28C7M|4|Easy on, easy off
B00OBEJVG0|5|Worked as described, smooths out spring travel.
B003UVKKSS|5|Great window cleaner! Love it.
B00JINPJD8|5|This is my second grit guard.  I never wash a car without one in the bucket.
B001QK1X5O|1|will not fit most trailer hitches
B000C5BO9E|3|It did not fit the gas tank cap...but it's okay. I will give it to someone who can use the item.
B0017J3XMU|5|I put this antenna up about a month ago, to use on CB as well as 10 meters.  For 10 meters (amateur radio), it replaced a half-wave dipole that was 30 feet high suspended between two trees. It clearly outperforms the dipole.<br /><br />On CB, I get nearly perfect 1:1 SWR with the IMAX 2000, on 10 meters without an antenna tuner, SWR is about 1.4:1. An antenna tuner easily cleans that up. Despite unfavorable band conditions, I've had solid contacts on 10 meters in Indiana, Texas and Illinois from my location in Georgia. A Chicago contact seemed amazed I was getting out on a vertical antenna. My transceiver is an old Kenwood TS-520SE with tube finals, a great old radio that works well with this antenna.<br /><br />I did not make any adjustment to the tuning rings, and I did not clip the end of the antenna.  It was good-to-go the way it came from the factory.<br /><br />The Solarcon presently mounted in the same area of trees where the dipole was, atop a 17 foot vertical mast of galvanized fence top rail, a little over 100 feet behind my house. This puts the top tip of the IMAX about 40 feet off the ground. I'm using good quality RG-213 coax for most the run (previously used with the dipole). Some people have expressed concern that the IMAX sways like crazy in the wind, but I'm not seeing that. The level of flexibility seems about right. I had no trouble raising the assembled mast and antenna by myself, though some help might be beneficial. The antenna did sway a bit when first raised, but once the mast was secured with five guy lines attached about 12 feet off the ground, the IMAX appears remarkably stable. We had some fierce wind gusts the other day, and the still maintained its erect position. I do not have the optional ground plane kit.<br /><br />Others have also commented on the IMAX's bright white color. Even when mounted among  trees, that bright white could be seen from well down my street. After initial tests showed the antenna was good, I dropped the mast, and and sprayed both the mast and antenna with olive color flat camo paint. It now blends well, and you have to know where to look to see it (I left the stainless steel section connectors unpainted, giving me visual points to spot check the antenna from my back porch).<br /><br />I'm not a skip junky on CB, but I hear high powered outlaws all over the country with the IMAX. Using a stock President Washington base station, it gives at least a four to five mile operating range on CB around my home, and that's with geographical and structural obstacles, as well as a less than perfect tool box mounted antenna on the mobile unit I have. Wish there were more locals using CB to give the antenna more testing, but local CB seems to have fallen out of fashion.<br /><br />The IMAX is a great receive antenna up and  down the amateur high frequency bands, I've found using an antenna tuner can greatly increase reception clarity.  Having a technician class amateur license, I'm limited to 10 meter for HF two way communications, so I have no experience using the IMAX on other bands.<br /><br />As a relatively new owner, I can't speak to long term durability. But I like what I've seen (and heard) so far.<br /><br />Better reception, better contacts, the IMAX has upped my Ham hobby satisfaction.  All in all, I think what I paid for the IMAX was money well spent.
B0013FY5GQ|5|Perfect fit.  Much better than the actual original, this one will not slide completely apart.
B000MDZLR2|5|Fits great on our RV spare tire. It was easy to put on.
B00S9FQQQU|4|I use these pads for whitewater kayaking (creeking).  They fit well and remain in place much better than most elbow pads that tend to slide somewhat while paddling due to getting wet, streched etc.  All and all excellent fit and use.
B00BJ7O3GA|2|It looked nice, but not very sturdy. It is already broken!
B003Y7V2VW|5|Fits my 3/4 helmet perfectly
B00L2NF1XA|2|These mats wore through in a few months. I realize they are inexpensive but expected a little more. Spend a little more and get a better set.
B0002MABGE|4|Definitely not perfectly designed for Subaru Outback 2014 (or generally new Subaru Outback body shape).  While it still fits perfectly fine and does excellently at keeping my Great Dane/Anatolian Shepherd mutt in the back, it can do some damage to your ceiling liner.  As it presses up in the middle of a rounded ceiling it can cause pulling and separating from the edges.  Nothing too major, just depends on your attention to detail
B00U7P6UV6|5|Item got here on time and was everything it was advertised to be
B0002SR4Q8|5|perfect for oil change job
B0043AV4NK|5|Fast shipping , Works perfect for the price .. louder than I  expected . . I recommend 👌💯
B00651C0VU|5|It arrived on time and it was easy to put on. I own a 06 cobalt and the antenna looks gud on it...better than one i had on it before.
B00PIVKQP0|5|Good price, looks great.
B00KIEGTF8|3|Not actually Red. It is a true metallic red if someone is in to that. Great weight and detail. Will scratch some when putting screws in tightly.
B004AHAD2E|5|Replaced a broken corroded circuit breaker on my RV Trailer.
B004I0HFQK|5|fit perfect 2005 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9 2WD quad cab. 10 minutes to install and brakes and lights work great. Saved a ton of money over the dealership
B00HDPO8YE|5|Was exactly what we needed Thank you so much.
B00PF0HIRS|2|Good. Bright. Minus one star for bad bulb install angle. Will update if anything changes. Installed to replace unreliable DDM HID kit on '14 f150 FX base. Much better than stock, not quite as intense as HID, but definitely workable.  Update: a few weeks later and one of the units' high beam capability does not work / when high beams are engaged one unit works and the other Goes out entirely. Not pleased. Will be contacting seller shortly to take them up on their 5 year warranty. Let's see if they honor it or if this was more money down the drain.
B00EEQIASA|2|Not quite sure.  I own a 2004 330ci. Was pumped when it arrived however you can't open it up to replace the RF. Who wants to pay to have a key cut with no RF. You get what u pay for. Remember keys have driver 1 and 2 to adjust seats. I would pass.
B006TYZ5ZQ|5|Work and look great fit flush
B000VTU41A|5|This fit perfectly on my 2003 Lexus rx 300.<br />(My first order, the hitch was defective and crooked.  Amazon let me return it for free and they mailed me a new one a few weeks later.  The new one fit perfectly).
B00P0SA7TQ|5|I got these to use in our RV.  The color is great and they work perfect.  They're not the brightest thing, but what bulb of this size, with this &#34;ambiance hue&#34; AND an LED is?  They did the trick for me.  Actually went back and bought another box to replace my landscape lights with!
B006CPH9WY|5|2000 Ford F250 10.5.  Bolts right on. No problems.
B0002MSY7M|5|3M has always been the brand for our machine shop. Used on finishing metals
B00KWJVDVY|5|work great fixed the problem runs great
B00XDAB0DK|5|I will be using this multi-purpose product in a variety of ways. I am a teacher so I will be using it to transport teaching supplies from my car to my classroom. I will be using this product in my classroom as needed for extra storage. I will also be using this product in my car as its original intended use to safely transport my &#34;soft groceries&#34; from the grocery store. No more smashed bread and crushed potato chips! I will also use it for road trip supplies: drinks, snacks, etc. This organizer is heavy duty, sturdy and the ultimate organizer for your car, house, or classroom use. I have other storage products from this company and they are of the same great quality. I was offered this product free of charge for my unbiased review. I am seriously considering purchasing another Trunk Organizer.
B00YEQLLRC|3|Very bright and very good lights. A bit disappointed after a literal 5 hours of actual on time one of the 9 LED's on the side of the bulb has already burned out ... but the rest are still working and are brighter then my stock bulbs given that they are red
B004YJU5S0|4|First time strut replacement went well. Plenty of online assistance and You tube videos to guide you thru. Will follow up later to see how the struts hold up over time. Lift was about 1.5 inches with the before and after measurements. Had trouble getting the units delivered kept getting defective units or missing hardware.  Amazon came thru and even had items overnighted to help me out.
B002N5W8Q4|4|Cheap feel to it but seems to work.
B002FOO8JS|5|Opened my order shipped by UPS with envelope, found this aftermarket Sparkplug Denso SC20HR11 Made in Japan,  price was cheaper than Toyota dealer. I installed and these sparkplugs worked great on my Toyota Corolla S 2010. Note: My suggestion to warmup your car engine first for easier to remove those 4 sparkplugs.
B004Y4QZKC|1|They WILL not last.  Critical seams have single stitching, which results in premature tearing at the slightest tug to slide a glove on or off.  These gloves should not break after a week of use. When an acceptable alternative is identified this review will be updated.
B00UMCJY9O|5|I got this for my brother who just got his car. He is a big runner and this was a huge hit!!
B00GG9FJKU|5|Looks great.
B00KXOCWJU|1|Product was very poor quality and did not match my paint job even though it was advertised as the same color code.
B00TGOFNHQ|4|handy tool easy to use.
B00KQJ62CU|5|If you are currently an owner of the horrible, unreliable, frustrating SRC system from Schuberth, you should rip that thing out right now and get a 10U.<br /><br />I installed 10U's on both mine and my wife's helmets and it just works. It doesn't drop out. It doesn't refuse to connect. We haven't had to re-pair the intercoms like we had to do daily with the SRC.<br /><br />The design of this product is pretty great. It hides inside the helmet and has no exposed parts, save for the two buttons in the inside edge of your visor hole. The whole thing takes maybe 10 minutes per helmet to install. A good 30 seconds to pair. And you're on your way.<br /><br />I'm still on the fence with regard to the remote control. I messed with it and it worked, but I guess I just don't have a need to change settings or change modes that often while I ride. Plus, everything can be done with the two buttons you have on the helmet itself, albeit in a more non-intuitive way. It's a cool device and it works just fine, I just find that I don't use it. (it might also be that my bike has a lot of button sand levers on the right handlebar and I'm reluctant to add a few more.) If I can talk to my wife while she's with me and listen to music when she's not, I'm happy.<br /><br />We'll see how this thing works long term but in just a few days I already like it 1000% more than the Schuberth product.
B005BTOR40|5|This cover fit my spare tire perfectly. I never had an issue with it. Unfortunately, I only had the 94 Isuzu Rodeo for just over a year before the engine essentially imploded on itself from regular driving (no off-roading or anything special). Not really, but lets just say that 6 things broke simultaneously that exceeded my willingness to repair on an engine with 200k miles on it. Anyway, back on track. The cover looks great and was designed well for those wanting the classic Isuzu Rodeo logo on their SUV. Would definitely recommend! Great job guys!
B00FKHKQ0W|5|Very happy
B009OAWPHS|5|Awesome
B000E4OHHY|5|Installation went smooth. Bolt holes lined up perfect and took all of 20 minutes to replace
B0031C8GFK|5|Exactly what I needed!
B008Y9DPDI|5|Great. Easy to install.
B004RIU1SM|5|Looks great.  Would buy again.
B003S2E4UE|5|Awesome product. Sets up strong after 24 hours. Very stick on your hands if you don't wear gloves; very hard to wash off. Also, and this was really cool, it is sort of robin's egg blue. When I had a little left over after use, I was looking for something to do with it and rolling it around between my palms (with latex gloves on). I noticed it looked a bit like a bird's egg, so I shaped it into a bird's egg and set it down to dry. A day later, we have an ornamental bird's egg to put in a nest. My girlfriend thought it was cool. It has a small flat spot where I set it down, so it doesn't roll away. Now she want's 2 more. I still have about half of the tube left, so I'll make another one when I work my next project.
B000CO91OA|1|These are horrible, the paint won't last for much more than a year, mine are maybe 2 years old and rusted all up.<br /><br />I should have took the advice from a forum, just sand your old ones down and use quality paint.
B000JRK9ZA|1|I'm disappointed this product Floor mats for 1964 thru 1970 is not available many are looking for them
B00EQ1VQ8Y|3|Haven't put them on but before I do I have to repaint them..... they paint the headers with regular ole crap that burns off immediately. Why not use hi-temp paint to begin with? Also it's obvious that as soon as they were painted they bagged them before they dried. Makes me think they're a knock off.
B00WAX4MZE|2|Did not work with my antigravity PPS 1 from micro start.  Both lights...correct and reverse lit up...
B0060A74V2|5|Very, very easy to install.
B001C5RM1M|5|Purchased and installed with the Borgeson 800120 steering gearbox. This gearbox and shaft set are designed as an exact replacement/ upgrade for Dodge Ram trucks and does so perfectly.  Installation was simple and straightforward. I have installed several Borgeson steering upgrade parts over the years for others who have been very satisfied. This is the first install of Borgeson parts on my own vehicle and I am very glad I did it. The quality and manufacturing of the parts is second to none, finishing is flawless.  Comparing designs, the Borgeson seems a much better choice: built of better materials, and likely to outlast the stock shaft by many years & miles.
B000A0EIJY|5|perfect fit. i really like to keep our cars in the best shape i can. and there aren't many items i know how to do on a modern car. this is one of them.
B000CONYCK|5|nice

B004131JHK|5|So happy with this purchase.<br /><br />My driverside window failed in the middle of winter. I heard some odd sounds inside my door, and all of a sudden my window wouldn't go up or down with the controls. But it would stay up as long as I didn't hit buttons. After a couple more days, something else broke inside the door, and the window would no longer hold itself up.<br /><br />Driving around with a constantly open window in the middle of winter? Not great.<br /><br />As soon as it broke, I did what probably everybody who doesn't know cars does: I googled to see how much it costs to have a professional replace your window's motor. I was seeing prices that seemed crazy.<br /><br />Then I did the next thing that probably anybody who doesn't know cars might do: I went on YouTube to find a video of somebody replacing their window motor, to see how hard it looks. Didn't look hard at all.<br /><br />I bought this. And it was easy to install, and it works great (it is now noticeably outperforming all the other window motors in my car).<br /><br />It was a pain to get the door prepped for installation, but that's the fault of the car maker. It also wasn't great having to wait a few days for my order to arrive (I wound up using magnets and garbage bags to construct a crude window just to keep any critters from climbing into my car when it was parked). It arrived fairly quickly, since I have Prime's 2-day shipping. But, whatever. Te part works great and is fairly easy to install, and it cost way less than most pro's would charge for the job.
B002OVO2FW|5|Have had no problems since using.
B00OC4MJNG|1|It didn't even last for a day.  Got blown out by the wind.
B00KTHWGQA|1|constantly changing batteries. Never works.
B00PSPSC20|5|For some reason, I got two. Very good product, functions perfectly, looks sharp.
B0031ZDU62|5|great quality, great price, thank you !!
B00LEBLI82|2|Not as bright as the regular bulbs. Saves alot of power when dry camping though.
B002P8KRT4|5|No problems at all.  Great buy!!!
B004VGAJOG|5|You save 200 buying this thing, very good
B00ZBCWAQ4|5|great item
B004W9094M|5|They fit perfect!!! I absolutely love them!! Easy installation and fast shipping!
B001EWG4VC|5|As expected.
B001N0E188|5|Great fix.  Fit perfectly
B00466V9AY|5|The best was to received the way to program it
B00BXMRP4I|5|small and compact. quite and come with oil.
B00865EC3W|1|The quality of these bumpers is very poor.  Two of the four leaked from the eye seams.  I have been trying to get warranty support and have been stuck with going through hoops to prove there is a problem.  Photos with bubbling from the leak were not good enough quality...like they would know quality.  Don't buy these, stick with Taylor Made.
B00CMSS9YC|5|Looks super cute and fits great!
B004YHR4PO|5|Love these seat covers. I have a 2013 Hyundai Elantra and they fit perfectly. It a bit tricky to get the seat to stay on there but once you find where to hook it up its all good. I also have machine washed and air dried these covers with no problems or changes to the covers themselves. They also cover all the way around your seat, so if you have a pocket or pouch behind the seats they will be covered.
B009MASZQU|5|I have a 2014 fusion and the fit is perfect.
B002BBDNFU|4|The fan assembly needed re-wiring to fit my 2003 Mini Cooper. The new assembly does not come with a fan speed control relay.  Otherwise straight forward installation and the fan works as it should once the modification is done.
B00U9YPRTG|1|Didn't fit....full refund was given
B008W1BF4O|5|So happy I got this.  It keeps things in the 'way back' cool as well as hidden.  A great purchase.
B002P8JIR6|5|The same as the stock mirror. Would have been nice if they had an option for a primer color.
B000IBDIX2|4|My 73 Suzuki gas tank was very rusty.  I pre-cleaned it as much as I could with vinegar soak and bolts and chains.<br />I used the KB was 5 times, etch twice.  The sealer was a little scary not being able to tell if I indeed covered all the interior surface area and wondering if there was enough sealer to coat the inside.  I used the full 1/2 hour and was constantly moving the sealer around and it payed off.<br />The true test will come with time, but it seems to be a really hard durable finish.
B000BQW5LK|4|Surprisingly it works well. Could use longer hoses.
B0088VIRTE|3|Thought product was a typical peel and stick sticker (I might have overlooked that)......its not....it is an individual letter transferrable decal - best left to a professional to install......its not easy to do let me tell you.  Product is nice....I just wished it was in a sticker format.
B000SXCLIS|4|A little hard to get on & off but it does what I bought it for, the construction & quality is good good for the price.
B00K0MKPLM|4|Nice product. It didnt come with a attachment piece. Just had a small key ring. Should have made note that it needed to be ordered with bell.
B009UKUUWE|5|Fine.
B00445L290|5|This was the replacement for the bulky eureka that went back.  It's a perfect size for a car and does everything it says it will.  Very strong suction and easy to use
B005QIFRD6|4|did not take long to get low price easy to put on. Got 20000 miles out of last set from dealer see how long they last less than 1000 miles so  far  they stop the bike that is a good thing !
B00XK1N04Y|4|The Kensun Air Compressor Inflator works perfectly when used with the 12V car plug.  It inflated the tires on my wheelbarrow in seconds, no muss no fuss!  I love that you preset the PSI on the automatic digital readout, screw on the device and then turn it on.  It then inflates the tires and you are done.  The worklight makes it easy to read the side of the tire so you know the PSI beforehand without searching in the dark.  The unit is compact for easy storage. I love this little workhorse and now feel safe with it in my car on any future road trips that I might take.  I only gave it 4 stars because the 110V adaptor immediately blew a fuse and simply doesn't work.  I am sure that Kensun will make it right with their acclaimed customer service, but why include an adaptor that is faulty in the first place?
B00FZQ0HPM|5|Replaced my 2000 Toyota Celica pump which was causing shorts with all the wipers.  Was genuine toyota part.  Did not have a replacement grommet so make sure you do not lose the factory one when replacing.  It is a simple unplug, pull out, and replace.
B0002STSQM|4|exactly as described
B001N0E188|5|My husbands has lost a couple now..thank heaven I can get the same ones for a lower price.
B00AZPI0NE|5|very good and fast
B002UD0GIG|1|does not what suppose to do, it is suppose to take scratch out form Sun glasses which is boloooney
B000N28ZKM|5|Item was as described and met my needs.
B0000AY69V|5|Great product!
B00RGZWIW0|4|Durable and sturdy.  It stands up on its own without sagging or folding up to allow for easy loading of items into it. The ability to collapse it to half the full size allows for flexibility and saves room when the entire organizer is not needed.
B0002SRH60|5|Good
B004X1UBUQ|5|Yep, I wear them all the time!!.Daytime and at Night!!! I would give them a A+. Especially for the price!!
B000CPAA3A|5|Just what I needed...
B00EECM5FI|5|work perfect and shipping was fast!
B00QGPKCJ2|5|Nice fit, good quality. Lots of coverage and looks good. Price is too high but all of these type products are overpriced so what do you do?
B00X7KSFLG|5|Great solution, filling a market need for a discontinued product. For whatever reason, some of us are stuck on the original pump bottle method.
B00MU01J4E|4|This is a quality product. It matches the stock panels on the Kia Soul perfectly. Please note: This will fit the 2014-2016 Kia Soul but not previous year models.<br /><br />The pieces are made of high quality ABS plastic. They are sturdy and should last at least as long as the original manufacturer pieces. The standard frame should fit most commercially available double DIN head units without need for alteration.<br /><br />Excellent quality piece for the money.
B000FW2MWW|5|great price, works well.[[ASIN:B000FW2MWW Battery Tender 081-0148-25 25' Quick Disconnect Extension Cable]]
B00VFE5NPM|5|LOVE IT!!!
B004UR1B7K|4|Works as advertised, wish I would've bought one sooner.
B002EC3TAA|5|Fit my 92 miata w/o any issues. Perfect fit for 1.6l miatas. not sure about the 1.8
B00KGID8DC|5|15 mins and back in business!
B003UIE8UM|5|Great product!! I absolutely love using this when on roadtrips with my littles. The cooler is perfect for little baby bottles and sippy cups and the outer section is what I use to organize their snacks. I highly recommend this especially to moms!
B005HF2E2K|3|Not as easy to install as I hoped, but does its job once installed. Also does not look as 'nice' as I was hoping. Now after 1 year, it starts coming off the door.
B000BQW5LK|5|Cant live life without it now. BUY IT
B000F0QR8O|5|Fits perfectly, protects dash very well, looks incredibly clean.
B00BFDHK3Q|4|So far so good, great quality and fits nice on honda civic 2002. Of course i did a little tweaking because it did not come with the clips
B002UCYRYQ|4|Works really well
B00FEI0788|5|Installation is a little long. If you are going to upgrade the grill to a 2007 or later you'll want to do that first or you'll get a space between the lights. Additionally, request instruction from Headlights Depot. HD was great.
B001OZXGME|5|Great quality, good looking doors. We get compliments all the time. We installed https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032HC0WE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_150 mirrors on them, and they work great. put something between the front and back mirror mounting flanges on the door when you tighten the mirror, or they will collapse. This is due to the design of the mirror, not due to a quality issue with the doors.
B000UIVWAO|5|Very good!!!!
B008AD7JQC|5|Worked great
B003EP2PIS|4|As advertised.  Have not had a chance to install them yet.
B00G2586NK|4|Will work good I'm sure.
B00BG6IJA0|1|If there's one thing I don't want my jack to do - it's fail.<br /><br />This jack failed after being used roughly 3 or 4 times. That's it.<br /><br />Not worth the money.
B001KQF6OI|5|workes
B007WR25ES|5|We drove 2000 miles on our first trip and it worked great. Easy to install.
B00EX9PO82|1|This is a joke.  DON'T BUY THIS
B00IKKS4W8|3|Everything looked good, went on easy, worked smooth the first time, the second time a small pin broke off one of the jack and it don't work. I put them on a camper, total weight 3200 lbs. the camper came with 2 already Got them in April, now waiting on a answer if Amazon is going to replace it. Not sure how to rate it but 1 star fits a broken jack. Will let you know if Amazon stands behind what they sale.. Just read a email stating they will replace it so I am raising my rating up to 3.
B00VCSRI4A|5|Arrived quickly and work great. Only problem is now there will be no hyper blinking when a bulb burns / falls out...
B00802GIW4|5|I must confess, I was kinda skeptical getting this kit, especially considering they cost less than a good set of replacement halogens. However, as soon as I opened the case, that skepticism went away. All the pieces to the kit feel to be very high quality, and well built. In addition, the install was a breeze and the results were amazing. Unfortunately, I liked the kit so much I plan on get another to replace the bulbs in my other car!
B001KYSBO2|4|What you see is what you get. Love the cleaning wipes! Plain & simple. I've bought these in stores and such, so I figure get them online being I don't go out and shop much.
B00TEHDXPO|2|I liked that this had both a spot for a table as well as pockets for other types of goodies, but that's about where my approval ends. The pockets on this tore at the seams as soon as my son decided to rest his foot on one of the slots. The bottom straps do not reach to the bottom of the front car seat where it is supposed to attach (Ford Fusion), so it's hanging loosely at the bottom and kind of flaps around. There is no slit that we could find for a cord or anything on the pocket where the tablet goes, so it needs to be taken out to charge or to plug in headphones. The material is somewhat flimsy and did not stand up to our preschooler's kicks.
B002S45W90|5|dont drive the boat much anymore but this is better than the starter that came with the boat new
B000XRHRZQ|5|I was very happy with the hubcaps I purchased.  They are almost identical to the ones I had lost.
B00O5QAMUI|3|They project fine but it's much more of a white light with a blue tint than a blue light.
B000O51VJ0|5|Bought this for a camping trip in the desert where there are burn bans.. super easy to use, easy to move, and feels like a real fire. It is small and does not put out as much heat as the real thing, but when you're in an area with a ban, it's usually warm enough. We brought a partially filled propane tank and it lasted 3 nights. Highly recommend for camping.
B00STTKNN8|5|Love it
B00NEL75E6|4|Great product
B000COBLG6|5|bright, true yellow. i liked them
B003BL1H0M|1|DIDNT TAKE LONG FOR THIS PRODUCT TO EAT ITSELF, NOT IMPRESSED
B000E4SQIA|5|It came with a new drive pin. D4 light quit flashing, check engine light went off, and speedometer works again. Is recommend it to friends or family.
B010R32L3I|5|Awesome product. Easy to apply, remove, and great results
B00JFTC0T6|4|Had to apply a silicone bead around it for a better fit.  Other than that, it looks nice.
B00FRSUWFS|5|Arrived well packaged with no marks or damage. Mounted to my 03 FLHT no problem. Looks good
B00NONLXTC|4|Wobbles a little bit but works perfectly on my 2011 CBR.  I'd buy again.
B00IX5MOD0|5|Awesome!  Fits like a glove, works great, looks awesome!
B00CE2TE5O|4|Look great but can't hardly put any Weight on them. Mounted easily by my 18 year old son!!
B006ZCCIH0|3|The background of the JCW logo is green on the actual product, didn't match the photo of the item listed for sale
B00IY1TL1G|1|This part is mislabeled. It is for the drivers side.  Will not work on passenger side.
B0009VA8GQ|5|Fits my 2000 Hyundai Elantra. I am a 45 year old female and I found it simple to install.
B00V9AUKW8|5|Excellent. Went into the truck with ease!!
B00X96RW5I|1|Install went alright, and they look good, that's about it as far as positives. Only drawback was for some reason when installing the passenger side unit the low beam socket wouldn't allow me to easily insert the bulb and lock it into place. I had to take off the locking ring, set the bulb in place, and screw the ring down over it just to get it in. Kind of a bother but nothing major. UPDATE 8/26/15 as others have stated these lights have a condensation issue. My drivers side light looks like it had the inside sprayed down with a hose. Ridiculous
B00594OIWS|5|Excellent quality and look great on my E350!
B00DSD7B62|5|A simple, straightforward product: was exactly as described. It looks great on glass. Just be careful when you are peeling it off and applying it----DO NOT BE IN A HURRY! This item is large and can easily tear in the application process if you are not careful.
B00BITLHZ4|1|Product did not fit
B00RD982MO|5|Have been using for only one day so far but I can already say it does what it says it does. The scent is good and nice but it IS strong, so I actually have it pretty much closed and it still seeps out enough for my liking. But the adjustable, twistable opening is perfect and genius, making this a MUST-HAVE for any ride-share Uber/Lyft drivers not wanting to annoy their passengers with strong, overpowering scents.<br /><br />**Will update with any concerns/product lasting statement.
B00A83EVDG|5|Our Honda Fit doesn't have a rack so I bought this to carry extra things on a camping trip for our family of four (2 adults, one infant, one toddler). I'm happy with the purchase and intend on using this again and again for our road trips. We were able to fit 3 camp chairs, two small luggages, some sheets and blankets, and filled the gaps with pillows, towels. There was still space left over for smaller things. The bag stood up in 100+ degrees weather and at 80 mph for 200 miles. This is a cheap and excellent alternative to a hard rooftop case. We used large binder clips to keep the straps from flapping noisily. My only complaint is that the bag takes on the shape of things underneath it so if you don't pack your things evenly (or not fill gaps), you'll have an irregularly shaped bag that may interfere with the car's aerodynamics. That said, I would purchase this again.
B0041EBSX4|5|It works as it should.  after a trial installation, i can not use it, as the lid which is made of osb starts splintering the board.  i will have to spend some extra time to configure with bolts instead of screws to secure.
B00BD6RXCS|5|This is the real deal, worked perfectly on my old Dakota. Comes with  very good instructions. The hardest part was separating the plug from the harness.
B008ETMV8I|5|I had them before nd they work great.
B003PJK5IK|5|After reading reviews I purchased a tap to clean out the rust in the brazed on nuts on my Toyota Matrix before installing. Good plan. The hitch took 10 minutes to install and it's perfect.
B0017OFWAG|5|They work great... No complaint.
B005RNEH5O|5|ETCG brought me here! you need this to keep your calipers maintained! this bottle will last a lifetime
B004GZKWAI|5|Fit perfect love your products.Thanks
B000X1YBO2|5|Really fast shipment & priced just right. The fit was spot on!
B004YJTVKI|3|Actual lift ends up a little over 1.5 inches on a 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab. Rides nice. After a few months the springs settled even more and front is 1 inch lower than the rear. So total lift is only about 1&#34; to 1.25&#34;  and was a lot of work and expense for very little lift. Not level.
B00HESFIJ4|2|After only a couple of uses, I have to tap it in order to get an accurate reading now.  At least I hope it's still accurate, I use it for my motorcycles.
B005JU5VH8|5|these are very good and seem 2 b quality wipers good buy
B002BI865U|2|I did not receive everything that was pictured, just the kit for the circular fog lights. I really bought to get the headlights protected.
B00P9EJGR0|5|Perfect mats for any seat!  Just as described!
B0002YUQ4E|5|Highly recommended
B0002ZPPKS|5|can't wait for next trip to use
B000XG8Q0W|4|Awesome. Keeps the headphones out of the floor and we use it to hang other stuff as well.  Would buy again.
B00AMPJ68U|5|So glad I found these, in auto parts stores they were $27 for just one shock.  Easy to install and working great.
B002IZKDHK|4|works great
B00FPL0NH4|4|After a month it's still working. Let's wait and see a year from now.
B00EN25AQ0|5|Put the decal on my son's CPU case...looks GREAT!
B003ZZQF56|5|Looks good
B00YML13OU|5|Ordered these (three pack for $9.99) for the obvious reason: my child was learning how to drive. They attach and remove easily from the vehicle body (without marring or scratching). I only use two (placing both on the rear of the vehicle). Numerous times I have observed driver's catching up to our vehicle from the rear and, prior to &#34;riding our bumper&#34;, they must see and read the &#34;Student Driver&#34; magnets as they back off and maintain a very safe distance behind us for the speed. So, they work!
B001NZO8YU|5|Quick and easy repair.
B005DVIUAI|5|Worked great, breath nicely and the price was good. They did their job.
B0041EVU1Y|5|I was surprised my car didn't come with this (2013 Maxima), but I wanted one, so I ordered it.<br /><br />This includes the long cargo net as pictures as well as the smaller nets that go on each side. The install was simple and the fit is spot on!
B00I3RBDDK|2|Most of the parts went on okay. However, the o-rings were slightly oversized and caused difficulty getting the hoses on. The hoses did not click on as well or as tight as the original parts. I worry about these leaking soon. Would have rather bought OE from BMW. The parts are difficult to change, and this ill fitting kit made it even more difficult.
B001P4D39K|5|perfect fit
B0096COC4I|5|Very good quality! Best buy i have made on Amazon for $75!
B00BCH4WTA|5|It's a spray bottle.  Feels pretty sturdy and sprays stuff.  Happy with it.
B00KTIY6BW|5|Work good
B001BSCQ8E|5|Fine.
B004BS0M50|1|Properly installed by shop on my 2012 f 250.  After 1500 miles the drivers side bag failed!  It appeared pinched in the middle.  Contacted Firestone and after some push back they sent another bag.  25 miles and another failure.  It appears the bracket supplied is to weak to support the bag and advertised weight.  Buyer beware and don't haul too much.
B003VTCTH4|5|It was an exact match
B001GN1GLM|5|What can I say, it's perfect, it does just what it is intended to do.
B00GR8KAHM|2|Forester writing rubbed off after a couple weeks of being in my work bag pocket. Nothing else was in the pocket to rub against it and there's only 1 key on the ring + the key fob. Very cheap quality
B000CQXW8Y|1|These were not the right size even though the on line tool said that they would be a match.
B00MB01LGY|5|These boots are comfortable and very flexible out of the box.  I walked around in them just to stretch them out a bit, but they really didn't need it.<br /><br />They are definitely a size small.  I wear a size 9 wide shoe, and ordered a 10.  It was a perfect fit (with riding socks, of course).<br /><br />If you have very large calves (mine are 18.5&#34;), they will fit--but barely.  It would be perfect for me if the overlap was about 1/2&#34; to 3/4&#34; longer and the straps (particularly the middle ones) at least another 1/2&#34;.<br /><br />I was going to give this four stars, but changed it to five because they are worth it.  This coming from someone who has never had $400 boots before and only rides occasionally.
B00I4D6SJ2|5|I bought this EVSE for my 2013 Nissan Leaf.  It's very high quality and easy to use at a price point lower than the competition.  The only complain some might have is that this model is basic.  No lights.  No noises.  Nothing.  It just works.  That's perfect for me, but not for folks that want bells and whistles.
B00X012ANG|5|Great Cover, Fits Perfect. I will buy again
B003V57NUQ|2|I bought the two set box of these but my review should apply for the single set as well so I've posted the same review for both.  Anyone one who wrote a review saying these are sturdy have not been on the Interstate in high cross winds.  After 10 hours mostly on the interstate, one folded driving at just under 80 mph with side winds of 16 mph. Not sure how fast the gusts were since the weather app did not say.  I bought two sets and was carrying two 10 foot Sun Dolphin excursion kayaks at 41 lbs each.  The 7 hour drive two days before was with no wind and I could hardly tell they were on the roof.  They fit secure.  Only issue was the cam straps would slip a little and loosen up which I'd have to re tighten at rest stops.  The drive home was much windier and I could hear and feel the difference then suddenly the driver side kayak shifted in the front about two feet to my left.  I had to slow way down and pull to the side.  The front Rack bent about 5 inches outward and another inch forward from the wind.  I had to bend it back enough to get it facing straight again on my roof.  This was dangerous for drivers behind me and myself.  I got home and straightened it out some more but it's still bent forward and paint is cracked so it will now rust too.  These are way too light gauge for interstate driving in windy conditions.  Had to drive last 4 hours home at 60 mph just to be safe.  One foam pad was gone after one trip and two others were splitting.  Have had to wrap them in electrical repair tape now. The bolts were too long for my 1999 Toyota Seinna van that it was hard not to scrape up the paint putting them on.  Had to cut them shorter with a cutting disk by an inch. Both my 1998 Honda CRV and 1996 odyssey factory cross bars were too narrow to fit.  The hand tightening knobs don't tighten enough by hand that you have to use a nut and box wrench to secure them safely so these are more like semi permanent mount.  They only have an assembly drawing with no written instructions or warnings about use and safety.  The webbing of the cam straps already are fraying after one trip.  The box  they came in said made in China.  They assembled rather easy and pieces fit pretty good but had to use a mallet a few times though to get some bolts started that did not line up quite right.  These are adequate for transporting at speeds lower than interstate speeds and in low wind, otherwise unreliable and not safe.  Not worth buying because I now have to replace anyway.  Would probably work fine on trailer in slip steam of vehicle where winds are much lower.  I plan to get a trailer now and maybe try mounting them there.
B008G3KG70|5|Good product and not to hard to install. After trying to polish my old lenses, I finally bought these. At this price, why waste your time trying to polish the old ones. Look and work great. Make sure you follow the instructions closely. I know that doesn't sound &#34;manly&#34;, but it's well worth it.
B002G1PBHI|3|Seems to work as described, just very hard to read.  Will eventually replace with something different.
B0093NAAY6|5|Everything seems to work properly when installed on my 2009 Honda Odyssey, no problems and instructions that came with it helped quite a bit.
B0037W0JPO|5|Much better quality than I was expecting. Strong, heavy weight material, not some cheap plastic decal.
B004IU240M|5|what I was look for.  It is nice
B011Q18D14|5|i had a check engine light on and this fixed it.
B00JALAYYM|5|great
B007OUMMNM|4|it's like every glow shift product very nice, but it have no screw inside the box the lock the dual pod .
B000ZLSF74|1|the water pressure drops considerably when using the hose attachment.
B00PWG6AC4|5|shades work great in my Wife's Town and Country minivan
B003NI1H5I|5|Perfect fit and so easy it would be a crime to pay someone to do this for you. After buying this originally for the hatch in my Dodge Magnum, I went and bought them for others in the family who were also having issues with there hoods/trunks.
B007OSL3DY|5|Great description, great seller
B0024ECE22|5|good product & service
B001C9S5S2|5|My car is back on the road thanks to the affordability
B00MTHPAN4|1|These SUCK!!!!  If they're too tight they don't light up. Not tight enough, don't light up. Waste of money.
B00387A6TC|3|This pad works as advertised, for the most part. Make sure it fits your floor jack. The internal diameter on the underside is 5&#34;, so it isn't 5&#34; overall. Keep in mind this fits OVER your jack plate; you don't center it on the plate. Otherwise, it should be plug and play. It will keep your jack from scratching the **** out of the jack points on the underside of your car. Poly material should last you many years without cracking or getting brittle. Due to the way it works, adjusting the jack may cause the pad to tip in one direction or another. Keep that in mind.<br /><br />A cheap alternative is to simply use a hockey puck in the center of your plate. If this wears out, I will try that next. The pad itself might be a little more stable while aligning the jack.
B00S5FY5XA|5|I'm 6' tall and weight 220. I wear an XL tshirt so I ordered an XL vest. And it fits perfect! Best vest out there for the price, would definitely recommend it!, it even came 2 days early
B00651CLCS|5|Must have for your Jeep.
B0009JKGJW|5|Yes, it's still a mystery how this product works, but it does.
B00LIHKA5Y|5|Purchased for my husband and he says this chock works great.
B00FO6Q6E4|5|gave this to my mom and she put it right on her car and doesn't come off
B0007N5758|2|much softer than I expected.
B0028QVNGO|5|Great goggles for riding
B00FYX21SM|5|Love it works great.
B011B25FLO|5|Really holds the water making it faster to wash the car.  Very happy with this.
B00U2YG09Y|4|Quick shipping. Good quality parts. I've used multiple other &#34;big brand&#34; lifts on other jeeps and this kit is just as good quality if not better. Comes with EVERYTHING needed to correctly lift your jeep. Only thing I would add is adjustable lower control arms.
B006K8V5M8|1|Very Bad and cheap painted. The gold color goes away while I'm installing them on my battery.<br />The look different than the image.
B0091Q3NCG|5|works great
B00F8PNCMA|5|Excellent fit.
B009FC8C5Y|5|The top fit better than the original factory top!! Great buy.
B009E2MSO6|5|was perfect and took husband no time at all to install to repair leak on RV toilet
B00ELHNM3K|5|love penzoil there is no other for me
B000CAYSK6|5|Perfect fit for my NA miata. W/ PS and AC
B003WOZOUM|4|I purchased this for a cross country trip in a Mini Cooper.  I cannot believe how much stuff could be put in this carrier.  Once we finally got it in position, it didn't move for the whole trip.  The straps were difficult to deal with and one strap popped off the window edge while we were on a highway.  Overall, this was a good buy and I would recommend it.  I also bough the Non-Skid Roof Pad.  That thing was a nightmare.  If we didn't get the pack positioned just right it flapped horribly (and was very loud) as we were driving.  Plus, it got balled up under the carrier.  I don't know WHY Rightline just doesn't make the bottom of the actual carrier skid proof.
B0002KKVIY|4|Works with electronic injection. Works in a turbocharged four cylinder.  Got two tank fills off of one bottle.
B000KYXD46|5|Received it in two days.  Found instructions on line how to program the fob.  Was able to get it completely programmed and working in about 15 minutes.  Very satisfied
B0008D6NK0|3|Can't do side to side garage parking unless you are a genious.  Might buy a cat with fribisee's to check the lateral parking or buy a paint brush for the entry to my garage  so the distance can be regulated (side-to-side). Any new ideas?<br />Judy
B008J4NAE2|3|Product arrived on time and well packaged.  Be aware that this is intented strictly for interior use as there is no protection against rain.  It is VERY bright and has a resaonable number of decent flash pattern.  Rated it at 3 starts because the lable that covers the switches was falling off and had to be glued in place.  That said, at this price point one cannot expect a superb level of quality or the use of high end materials or manufacturing processes.  If you need something very durable and well built then be prepared to spent a lot more money.
B0091EZM18|5|Works just like the more expensive one at less than half the cost.  I'll definitely buy more of these when I need them.
B0054JYWJW|5|Mini manual encouraged replacing this bolts when installing a new motor mount, and being an OES genuine part, this bolt was very a perfect fit to replace the old crusty bolt that held the old mount in place.
B001NYYREC|3|This appears to be will made but it DOES NOT fit the factory mount on a 2013 Silverado  and the trucks plug was not long enough to mount anywhere else.
B00UL3EK7K|5|Perfect fit and easily installed.
B00GRP6DZI|5|EXCELENT FOR C230K 2005
B007V2B752|5|I've purchased three of these now for 3 different cars and they have fit perfect every time.  Noticeable drop in interior temp when in direct sunlight and saves my hands from getting singed on the steering wheel. A must if you park in the sun at work in Texas.
B00C2SXD20|5|I bought these for my 2014 Ford 150 and they are amazing. It helps protects my carpet when I take my dog around, go surfing, and snowboarding. It's easy to clean just take out and wash down with a water holes! Worth the price!
B007H8DKJG|5|Excellent.
B00651C4EI|1|Did not fit my 2007 xterra, none of the adapters that came with it accommodated the threads. Very disappointed
B001FCT0HQ|3|Shipped and arrived quickly. Directions could have been more clear. They aren't designed for off road use. Rather flimsy actually, I weigh 175 and when standing on them I can feel flex and bend from the mounting brackets. Though they look nice and were fairly easy to install I was expecting a little more sturdiness to them. Overall, not bad if you just wanna make your truck look better.
B00B02LBNC|5|Perfect fit great product well made to.
B001KQD7FI|4|Price was  reasonable.  Received in timely manner.  Product was as described.
B0000AXRH5|5|it funnels
B009FC8C5Y|5|Everything looked brand new. The top fits well, no obvious wrinkles. The half doors once put on the old hardware, do not initially fit well when closing the doors, it needs quite a bit of what I call massaging, pull, twist(you get the picture). Noise level not too bad. No leaks anywhere. So Far so good. I have no idea what the durability on these things are.
B006N95QP6|5|ok
B0016KG778|5|I wish they were 2&#34;
B00T6J8R2E|2|The magnets did not hold to tank. Gave it a two because it is a nice looking bag
B00BTGSIDU|5|Top quality towel. They are thick and absorbent. Very soft
B007Y858CQ|5|Fery good
B00CU6BB28|5|I always have a flashlight for me and my pup this way and the safety feature of the bow is great as well.
B00SXA2CMI|5|Good product but had to return as it didn't meet the need I had to fulfill.  Customer service was great.
B00LW7MRWO|5|It is perfect.
B002UC30AS|5|My kids love adding states as we travel.<br />We didn't check the dimensions before I ordered. It was too big for the back of a mini van, but would be perfect as intended fit an RV. We put in on a poster board and hung it on their wall.
B008WF013G|5|Very nice show quality metal emblem. The size is exactly as stated in the description. The emblem must go on a flat surface as there is no flex in the thick metal base.  They make larger emblems if this is to small for your application.
B004ME11FS|5|Came fast and price good
B00GJKXW8M|1|I bought these May 17th for my Honda Spirit vt1100 and not even 2 months and 3 lights went out on one side , I was hoping they would last a couple years ,some LED lights say 50,000 hours ,oh well this will be my 3rd set of lights I'll be putting a different kind. I had regular big Halogen lights on it and wanted something with lower watts ,I'm not too sure LEDs are that great ,if they don't last
B000BO71M0|1|Not reflective enough to wear as a safety mechanism for bicycling.
B008QSK1EI|1|I thought 4.49 was a little steep for shipping one bumper sticker.
B005NLQAHS|5|Worked right out of the box!  Found my fault code using the Torque (free) app.  Now to decide if I want to fix the problem myself or take it in!
B00I9IP1MM|5|Love it thank you
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works as advertised. It's pretty easy to fold up.
B00B1V9N3C|2|Not impressed with design or function.  I bought into the hype that this was a really cool, new helmet.  As a half helmet with no mask it's functional, but not optimal.<br /><br />The rear collar area catches the wind horribly and makes it hard to turn my head at speed, a safety issue.  Above 65mph the wind pressure inside the helmet is significant and very distracting, again due to the rear padding/collar I believe.  The helmet also will pull straight up from all the wind it catches and dig the chin strap into your neck.  The chin strap is ridiculously, insanely, unnecessarily long.  Seriously, unless you're Herman Munster with a face 3' long you're going to have a ton of slack and there is no built in way to shorten it.<br /><br />The facemask is not at all comfortable or easy to put on.  It rubs the bridge of the nose when riding, painfully so at speed, and you can't put the helmet on with the mask in place so you have to fumble the thing into place after.  Also equally annoying to have to take the mask off when removing the helmet.<br /><br />Overall NOT worth the money.  Many better, more economical options out there.  I would not recommend. After 3 rides you can find my helmet on craigslist in the near future.
B00A66GYDA|4|When I opened the package I was disappointed, the device felt supper cheap.  But hey I got it so let give it a try and see,  it worked well read the codes and allowed me to reset them with no problem at all.  I gave 4 stars just because it really does feel cheep in your hands and I am sure it would fail under daily use by a mechanic.
B0091U209E|4|love it
B0030DIURE|5|Super strong and fit like a charm on my 2004 Cherokee.
B00DNX92TQ|5|love this item I got it sooner than I thought and it just right for my rain suit. it holds onto my tank and I don't worry about it. even when I am going quicker than I should. the little cover is also great to protect it from the weather.
B0077FJWFK|5|great buy
B00XKYCF5Q|1|It doesn't stick properly to the tank. I have bought 4 of them and all of them r the same. It comes off after u place it on the tank. The glue is bad I think. Low quality. Don't waste your money on it. Pay a little more and get something that sticks and stays on the tank. See the pics.
B00SI17M04|5|My husband said it was easy to install. The removable fast hitch ball is great if you need to haul In The back of your truck! Very satisfied!
B007V2DFY8|3|The fit is really only OK.  The cover is far superior to any crap you buy at the local auto parts stores, but this fit is a bit of a disappointment.  The cutout is too small for the rear-view mirror and I have to wiggle it around the mirror and that is irritating.<br /><br />This was installed on a 2010 Altima 4 door.
B000C5DUN2|5|These were the exact thing I needed to replace the cruise control switch on my 2002 Sport Trac...the originals were cracking and although they worked the button underneath the plastic finally shown through so these were a very easy plug and play replacement.  YouTube has a few examples of how to take off the air bag (just a couple screws holding the airbag in place - then let it dangle)...then remove the four screws on the control switch, remove the plug (one on each side) replace the plug, replace the airbag...easy...save a few bucks for something you can't fix yourself.
B005TB7ES6|1|A wasn't of money
B0057PLMSM|1|Do not purchase this idiot they are very cheaply made the rear seat cover won't even fit in my explorer the straps ripped off the front trying to put them on it was a total waste of 70$ I'm very disappointed
B0002MABGE|4|This item was easy to assemble, and sfrighf forwad to install.  Only issues we had was that the dog could push the bars either down or over to get into the passenger compartment  I had to use rubber and hoseclamps tok prevent her from getting into the compartment . I do recommend it to others.
B00L1S0JU6|5|I was very impressed by this towel. I use it to dry paint and glass on a normal sized car. I don't risk using it for molding near the wheels or on the tires/rims. It absorbs like magic and does not seem to require any ringing-out. I previously used a set &#34;AmazonBasics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth&#34; and was very unimpressed with them. This single microfiber towel does the job that so many smaller ones could not. I use the other ones on the wheels/tires.
B003PIYUCI|5|Fit 2004, 350z but had to grind off about 2mm from the square plate that's attached to the crash bar to make it a snug fit. I will be using this for bikes, will not be towing anything, however, it feels strong enough to do a light tow.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|This thing is awesome. Works well in all aspects. Love it.
B005O6HVHU|1|Don't buy this product!! !!! Waste of money!  It hasn't even been a year and it don't work no more. I bought it for my fiance to use. So much for that.. Im a very dissatisfied costumer. Omg I have to have at least 1 star which is not worth it.
B009DK1OQ2|5|I put this on my 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5l. It was shipped very  fast,  and it was packaged very well. It fit perfectly, for the price this is an excellent product. I definantly recommend it,  it is a very good performance upgrade. I have more horse power, and it also makes an amazing sound. Great product!  Check out my review on Youtube : [...]
B007TXEPWK|3|good product, but need to buy a additionnal parts for the wiring water wif, for all dodge ram cummins, 5.9l from 04 to 07
B009FUFBTG|1|These towels down work very well. They are very small and don't seem to absorb water unless you force the water into them. I was very disappointed. I only use these to clean my car's tires now.
B006ZSUKXI|5|Perfect replacement for the hood lifts on my 2004 Lexus GX 470.  Install took 10 minutes.
B002G3Z7PC|5|good price for OE blades, they last forever
B0000CBIK5|3|missing a piece so could not use for the kiddie pools
B00ODF23QW|5|Great experience!!!! Great product!!!! Very very pleased. Also a personal note was included thanking me for my purchase. Very nice touch.
B000C5G3W2|3|Will not ne able to use it, no size mentioned in the add, had to guess, now it won't fit.  My bad, I was just hoping it would fit.
B00ANZHG4U|5|These are much better than the Amazon ones.  I've tried both and these seem like higher quality.  I am usually a fan of amazon products but not here.
B000ALBYZO|4|I am very please with it ,I would recommend it.
B005NLQAHS|5|WORKS VERY WELL FOR THE PRICE POINT
B00BWX5U6I|5|Unit arrived as indicated and put into service right away.  Works great now I don't have to shout at wife.
B00DMTTSIQ|5|excellent, easy to care for
B005C5DZR8|5|Great product.  Worth every dollar.
B0081TGGAK|5|good
B000CC4O58|1|They funny work , attract deer
B001AY2WLU|4|cool pocket tool.  i keep it on my keychain and have used it - screwdrivers and bottle opener - several times already (i've had it for a 10 days).  i was kinda bummed when i realized it didn't have a blade and i expected it to have one for some reason.  i haven't tried the wire cutters yet, though.
B00D9C2CDO|4|worked perfectly for our needs and fits a ton!
B002GTT324|4|My stupid self thought they were frame sliders.
B003NAJBIG|4|This item arrived a day early which was great! Opened the box and there was no assembly or product instruction sheet. Did not take an aircraft mechanic to assemble anyway. Ive traveled with one bike on it so far and it works great. very sturdy product. It does sway a little on the hitch but there is no way to anchor it. Its not going anywhere any. For the price I recommend this product.
B005WG88KQ|4|Well... it works. Attach to tire. Turn on. Fills tire. Though, I noticed the gauge shows 4-5 PSI higher than what is actually in the tire. It is not a big deal though.
B00MGI60RQ|5|Great for the price really bright!
B000C5WCHC|5|All the right stuff, all the right prices. thanks
B002OAT9BK|5|So far so good. Few years back ordered a generic replacement which went out recently.  Rick's Rectifier looks to be well made if not better than OEM! Install is easy and can be found in the gixxer or gsxr forums or even on YouTube. Just look up K6 GSXR Regulator Rectifier Install and it should come up. I would also recommend relocating it to the side of the bike to keep the unit even cooler (which can be found on youtube or googling it). From factory it sits between the radiator and next to the headers so if you aren't moving the unit will over heat and eventually die. Rick's is known to be the best replacement due to it's Mosfet design which can be identified by the two separate cable coming out of it... So if you do decided to cheep out (which I don't because you'll probably have to end up buying a new one anyway) make sure it's of Mosfet Design.  In addition to that pick up a new Stator. Usually if a Regulator Rectifier is going out, it means the Stator will eventually go too! Ricks makes one which has great reviews! I got lucky and found one on Ebay brand new.  Once you get things replaced, check the voltage to the battery to make sure they are with in spec (I think 14-15V at 4000RM but don't quote me on that)! You don't want a part to over charge the battery as well!  You can also find GSXR install manuals online some where so get it and read up. Don't be a fool and ruin your electrical because you wanted to be cheap and quick!!
B002VPLB32|5|Replacing factory filter in Toyota RAV4.  This was identical to the part being replaced.  Get this instead of &#34;genuine Toyota&#34; for the same item for a little less.
B00IKHVK5O|5|Product worked great and great price
B004A6JA2O|5|Replacing original filters in Toyota RAV4.  These look the same as factory but with activated carbon to absorb some odors.
B00PFCK8W8|5|Excellent
B00Q5E4LV4|5|This Earth-Air Optimum Ionizer is interesting. It is small, portable and plugs into the car cigarette lighter. It is a little hard for me to review this since my car apparently does not provide juice to the cigarette lighter when the ignition is turned off.<br /><br />There is a blue LED what lights up to let you know it is working. I have been using it whenever I am in the car so it is cleaning the air 30 minutes at a time. I am not a smoker so there are not any real funky odors in my vehicle.<br /><br />I do plan on keeping this plugged in, even if I cannot smell a difference I do like that it will filter out pollution. I will really put this to the test in the spring when the pollen is off the charts.<br /><br />I received this Earth-Air Optimum Ionizer at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased and honest product review.
B000CHMLKI|5|Has worked great thus far. Felt right on the install, and works, can't ask for anything more.
B00IK2MNZK|5|Works good on a Tecumseh H30 engine
B002SDTV4S|5|Has been working perfectly since install on my 2002 Jeep Liberty.
B0040CU00E|2|Does not fit Mazda rx8
B00GSAUHB8|4|I had no issue with this not staying up to protect the windshield in an Audi A4.  I haven't tried it in our SUV yet which has a much bigger windshield, but it's pretty large so I can't imagine that would be an issue.  It doesn't make the car less hot or deflect heat/sun, it really only just protects the leather interior from being scorching hot from touch.  Ideally I would find one that could help deflect heat as my car gets well over 100 in the sun.  It's easy to pack and fits in the case when not in use.
B0050NGB32|5|Simple, decently built, and seems to do its job just fine. Not stainless steel or anything, but doesn't need to be.
B001TNX0IQ|5|good price and fast shipping.
B00AFO749Q|5|I notice kids immediately stop crying when they start to notice this in my car. Its fun to watch them slowly pull tissues as if they are wondering if its ok to or something lolz
B004JVCKU4|5|Easy to install and works great
B0053P69IO|5|Very nice but very heavy as well.
B00J73BXGG|5|Nice unit, Very easy to install and setup. The vehicle specific hookup wiring made it a breeze to install on my truck. Very quick shipping by supplier.
B008032N2W|5|Good quality and by far the cheapest through out the whole internet for this part. Fixed the problem as well.
B00SUTHIVM|5|very nice - very heavy had to find in normal store
B00KGIB1Z4|5|Direct bolt on simplicity,alignment with no issues
B0043063JU|4|Fabulous Matt, looks great and makes the entire area lovely.
B0021UMFF0|3|This pump works for the price...I must say it held me through my newbie stage..lol...it started leaking around the sight glass and I never dropped it.
B00OBY36KW|4|Good for securing your gear when you're in a sketchy area or will be away from your bike for a while.  It's &#34;pre-coiled&#34; so it's compact enough that it stores easily in your saddle bag, but that coiling makes it a little difficult to work with.  The lock mechanism doesn't have very tight tolerances so it seems pretty loose.  Don't know how easy it would be to defeat, but it's definitely good enough to deter the casual thief who can't afford to spend time defeating it in public.
B00J7KOT5Q|5|My husband has tried many products in hopes to get our boat seats back in new looking condition and never found anything that lived up to what it claimed until I found the Duragloss 542 here on Amazon. He sprayed it on and the grime literally just started coming off with very little effort. Our seats had dark spots which looked like mildew but no mildew remover would remove them. A friend told me that it was from the sunscreen we use and sure enough every place where it was on the seats are the parts where we typically apply sunscreen more heavily on our bodies and then touch the seats. This is the only product that has successfully removed these spots and I am so glad that we gave this product a try. Our seats look great again and my husband couldn't be happier.
B00Q71V56O|4|Really good! Easy to put on!
B005JU5W54|4|26&#34;<br />it doesn't fit toyota corolla 2012 100%, but about 95%<br />there is sound in somewhere on driver side, although it cleans well.<br />16&#34;<br />it is perfect.
B000WJBF6C|4|I am very happy with this air breather, but there was a couple ticks to work out.<br /><br />Ok, first, it arrived quickly and that was great, but, the package inside the shipping box was open and the parts were loose rattling around randomly.<br /><br />Second, the mounting bolts for the filter were half an inch too long, and i had to grind them down to fit.<br /><br />Other than that, it solved my power lag problem, and now i can hear the valves hiss, which is a sweet sound. I am overall impressed with this part.
B00XU34OG0|5|I highly recommend this for any and everyone! It instantly turns your car into a Disney Cars-looking character, all while keeping the inside of your car cooler than it would if it were not on. Does it keep all heat out? No. Is it as effective as other name-brand sunshades? Probably not. It honestly gets pretty hot, but then again I have not tried any other sunshades, so keep that in mind, but I'm actually going to try out a standard one on two separate equal-temperature days and measure the car's interior temp with an industrial laser thermometer. Check back for that info soon!
B0006IX7Y2|5|Works great, heavy duty, and easy to store.  A must for hooking up sewage pipe for full hook up camping!!
B00BFWK4WG|4|So I've had it for a while. I got the wrong screws for the shoulder Brace thing. So I went without it. I'm glad I did. It's bulky enough that my helmet hits the shoulder. On either side. So when I'm fully stopped I have to let go of one of the handle bars and turn in order to look for traffic or anything. I recommend you wear a meshjacket over it. The fabric that holds the armour in place to give it that shape you see in the picture is just spandex. It's super comfortable but I'm sure it will shred it and the armour might fall off... let's hope I never find out. Movement is great for the arms. But the front bottom armour hits the tank on street bike.  This armour is awesome.I get compliments all the time. And people look at me like they've never seen a full armour guy on a motorcycle because they haven't. I scared a store clerk when I was paying for my drink... over all I rate 4 is cheap. But if it went to mesh. Or leather perhaps. It would be a 5
B00ANVNV20|1|Cheap, weak plastic. All four broke/cracked trying to install.
B004D5MQOG|5|My bit of research(2 years of reading oil and filtration reports along with more than a few oil anylsis reports) tell me this is a good filter that fits my needs at a price I'm good with.
B00V89ZVII|5|Product was exactly as described.  Arrived super quick and the quality was excellent!
B00MBECD1M|5|This led bulbs work well and the price is nice will by more I need them
B003FPF22I|5|Wow!! Just amazing.
B00BSO3JK0|5|I was so happy to be able to replace my key fab. It works great.😄
B0040ZXDNC|5|I had an issue with delivery on the first round - they placed it on my doorstep of my apt complex.<br />The second time worked out great.<br /><br />The color is great, the style and weight is awesome.  The shipper worked everything out for me in a timely manner.
B00KQ81M94|5|Amazing. Streak free wiping everytime!
B00OT4S21C|3|The 3m strap doest stick well
B00QPI35XA|2|Lights seems good as others have said, they come individual in 2 bags. I received 2 left lamps and will live with it. Would I buy again from this seller ....NO
B000C9QD1E|5|Make a high difference to burn gas efficiency in this 5.7 L.
B007ECE1FM|5|Great prouct
B00E1SDOBY|3|Only problem I have is the range the remote has and what it should be. I basically have to stand right next to my car to use it. My last one had a sensor for the range and this clearly didn't. 😕
B000LOLWZW|5|I use them for connecting safety chains on a sailboat trailer.
B00029JW6M|5|Great to do business with, will buy again
B004ME8MZ0|5|they fit my truck like a glove I just love them
B009MATOD8|5|This sun shade fits perfectly in my 2014 VW Passat. Good quality.
B00BITI8VU|3|Part does not match the interior of my 2004 Tacoma, was a few shades darker.  Additionally, the plastic insert on the back broke after clipping it.  Had to re-use the old one from the original part.
B004EKYB7U|4|Dull color compared to my other glossy knobs but it is functional/
B004WO9PO2|4|Item arrived on time- had them installed on a 2006 Nissan Xterra. My previous shocks were making squeaky noises and ride was rough when going over speed bumps or pot holes - not to mention I do a fair amount of off roading, it was time to change then after 115,000 miles. Chose these because of the good reviews and the company's reputation.  So far so good, ride is so much more comfortable and the squeakings gone!
B00BG3GT6E|5|Car has been consistently starting since we replaced this part.
B00FPR1SXG|5|Smells great, lasts for a decent while (~month). Cut them in half because the smell is kind of strong.
B000VU7M4Q|5|This HEAVY mat fits perfectly in my 2015 F250 with the 6'8''bed. Buy this mat. You will like it too.
B000KL5AL8|3|There are more cost effective alternatives. These don't lay great kind of moving around. Disappointing for this price.
B001M0XR3Y|5|perfect!!  Comes with everything you need.
B000I2079E|5|love it
B002MAO034|1|Assembled fine; however, it cannot support 500 lbs, let along our 130 pound Honda generator.  Just 10 miles down the road only carrying the generator, it bent to within a few inches of the road.  We made it back home and left the generator and rack there.
B000CHKUCY|5|If you need a GE 25576-55 miniature automotive light bulb, you probably won't find a better buy than this. Quality, Hey it's made by GE. They been around for a while. I think they pretty much have it down to a science.<br />Jim A.
B00MRV83G8|5|Replaced all the LEDs in my 2013 Nissan Maxima. These are a huge improvement over the stock gross yellow tinted lights. These are crisp and clear. A lot of people will recommend going with VLEDs or another pricier solution - for the price of ONE VLED I can get two orders of these. I've had mine in for about 8 months now....none of them have failed yet, and if they do I have extras! Highly recommended!<br /><br />Update March 10th, 2016: It's been quite a while since I installed these. My concern was that surely, since these were so cheap when compared to brands like VLEDs was that I'd see a lot of failure. To date not a single one in my car has failed. I have them over the license plate, in the door lights, under the dash, in the map lights, in the rear-seat courtesy lights...I think all told I have around 12-14 installed and they're all still going strong.
B000UVUAFO|4|Pretty good stuff, it reduces the scratch it does not REMOVE IT completely. Overall it's a great product just make sure you read the instructions.
B002DTV2S0|5|Allows me to reach multiple batteries with out moving my tender
B001KQD7XA|2|Item did not come with window (glass) connector/mount to the regulator, which needed to bring the window up or down.  In addition, I did not see listing for this piece. I saw a posted comment indicating to utilize existing connector/mount from the existing regulator, but when you replace the OEM regulator part cannot be disconnected or removed.  Recommend ordering the OEM regulator to ensure motor and window mounts fit properly.  Our local BMW dealership only sells the motor and regulator as component for under $200.00 plus tax... I'll find out why after I received and attempt to install the OEM regulator I just order.  I have an uneasy feeling removing the motor from the broken regulator to the new one may not be as simple as it looks.
B008MCDCA8|5|Lost them in a Washington DC cab - tried to re-order, but couldn't get more, guess they are out of stock
B00JXNJ36M|1|Overheats and fails after 15 minutes.  Easy to install, but not worth the effort, given its quick failure.
B000F15GBM|4|perfect,easy to install and helps block the heat
B001DGEY1Q|5|easy to install.
B000NTE6LW|5|Great product.  OE part fits perfectly.  If any needs help removing the old one let me know.  There's a super easy way to remove it.
B0031GRUD0|4|I previously purchased a Stant locking fuel cap and it was leaking gas (when it stated it was compatible with my vehicle)<br />I returned that and purchased this Motorad one, I love it except the fact that it has that metal dust cover you have to move every time.<br />I must say it feels very high quality, even the keys feel a lot beefier than the Stant fuel cap and it fits perfect.<br /><br />My vehicle is a 1999 Mazda B-3000 (Ford Ranger)
B0012GTVVA|5|If you have rv this one is a must have  great
B00030BFQA|5|Goood
B0002UEN1A|5|Used this for my smoker to seal holes, works perfect with the high temperatures.
B00SX5RSA4|5|Works as it should. No issues.
B004GNJCYC|5|Installed heatshield on the gas line from fuel pump to carburetor on 1941 Plymouth. Size was perfect and needed no trimming. Solved my vapor lock problem as well.
B000VXA7C2|5|For all the people complaining about which helmet fits what and leaving bad reviews can go jump off a cliff. I have this for my Shoei RF1200, but I bought the right one for my helmet. I ride in the winter and it hasnt fogged up on me once. Never had any problems with scratches and the field of view is perfect and Im very picky about line of sight. Dont put anything your helmet that will cause it to scratch and youll have no issues. People getting so picky about the pinlock thing is stupid too. All you have to do is clean your visor well then pull the plastic protectors off bend the visor and place the insert into the pinlock grooves. I havent had any problems with it. Essential for year long riding.
B0084XOWX6|3|Does as intended but I feel as if it could be made a little better.
B0061R3CBU|5|Excellant product great stellar item received sooner than stated.
B0046NUOLM|1|Bought this to upgrade<br />My 04 2500. Right before I was going to install, fca lost a lawsuit and started recalling all<br />2008-2012 4x steering due to death wobble. I emailed seller saying I wanted a return shipping label because the unit is being recalled on those stock trucks and they refused. Don't buy a recalled steering assembly!
B0015PK3AG|4|item as described  not used yet.
B007TXZ48Y|5|This after market brake light dir perfectly in the old rubber gasket and the screw holes lined up perfectly. From the rear this light looks exactly like the<br />Old one. My old electrical connector worked perfectly in the new product but In case of a problem a new connector is included.
B0087PZWE4|5|Pretty easy to hook up!
B000CQ6C6S|5|This brush is great!  Bristles on the sides make it very unusual, and keep you from marring protrusions like rear view mirrors, when you bump in to them.
B0007Y4K8C|3|Works satisfactory
B005G849E4|1|I'm not a fan of bumper stickers that have the makers advertising on them. I had to cut off a good quarter of an inch to get the sticker without those details. Disappointed for the price it cost. .
B0012P2KB4|5|Haven't installed it yet but it looks like it should be great.
B0010E00T6|5|I should have bought one of these a long time ago for my car. After changing this, I could easily notice how cold my AC was and my car didn't feel or smell as muggy. The old filter was horrible. Product was great quality. Thanks!
B00DNU3O7A|5|These worked for our Camry where I could not use a terminal with higher studs.
B00J8BE1NY|4|Nice for big rig for table easy to quickly use for meals.
B000C9HAVG|5|Perfect fit for 2002 GMC Yukon, rear air
B003HB2ALG|1|One cracked after it was put on and lost 2 going down the road very cheap made
B001RFZUL6|5|A+
B001GJ9JPQ|5|Good sturdy quality, shoots hard and far when on center.
B000CIY0U6|3|The tailgate mat need some fitting to make it look and fit right, but it is heavy duty, and once it's installed will work fine.
B000GV7S94|5|Barnett is always the best.
B00029JZIM|5|Great to do business with, will buy again
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Very easy to use. Made of safe material, as advised by manufacturer after asking them.
B00JBJ3R9M|5|The chrome headlights for my mustang are great they where delivered before the date that i expected once i installed them they made my car looker really nice i am very happy with my purches
B000C458N8|5|It fit like it should.  This is the third day driving the vehicle and no issues.  Price was reaonsable compared to the big box automotive stores locally.
B00ERXG4TM|5|Works great, no issues to report. Installs in a few seconds. Happy with it. that's it, the following text is just mumbo jumbo, so no real help is provided in reading what follows next........... you're still here, why are you still reading this......... wow, you don't give up huh! OK, keep reading because I have nothing more to add...... OK, you're really suborn huh? I said I'm done like 5 sentences ago, go do something productive, like read the next review.  :)
B000E2APZO|5|Good for the money.
B00DDOSPCU|4|Color is good (just like incandescent). Replaced 10 ceiling lamps in houseboat. Can now have more than 3 on without the house batteries crying uncle. Getting slight flicker from several, but very happy overall. Great value.
B00EZWGJBS|5|Easy to set up and hoist my 4 stroke Yamaha to get track off ground. Configuration of my sled would not accept some of the cheaper lifts, but this one is real sweet.
B004TRKBOK|5|Small and compact but I think they are going to work great if ever needed..
B00H9S71LW|4|VERY NICE BUT PICKING WHEN TRYING TO CONNECT
B00R1XEPFU|3|OK
B005H49GTA|5|Excellent
B002OMNRM0|5|This is a solid, heavy duty stand. Works will with my BMW r9t and holds it up solidly.It takes some rolling momentum to roll the bike up, so it's best to allow room for that. I use it to position the bike against a garage wall lengthwise next to may car and it's perfect for that. I recommend propping the front against a wall or bolting it down. Can be used to bolt down into a truck bed for travel/carry.
B0034RKPFG|5|Yep it worked great and it arrived very quickly at a very good price. Dissolved carbon !
B001JT5OL6|5|Hubby wanted one for his truck and this fit the bill. He loves it and has been using it since Christmas without any issues what so ever. If it ever breaks I'll buy this on all over again!
B002Q3LP5I|4|Nice product!
B00FJUEO12|1|The description says it has a 400lb weight capacity. This is not accurate, we purchased it because of the weight is was able to handle. Now that we have it, it hardly can hold 100lb. We are a hydraulic company and need a sturdy cart to use in our warehouse. This is not it! We are very unhappy with this item.
B00JGMAME2|5|This Bamboo Stove Top Work Surface is the best ever.  I got two induction burners and don't use my electric stove at all now.  It works beautiful and the adjustable feet make it great for meeting our needs.  We would purchase again any day.<br />Kati
B003CG9QFY|1|The product delivered DOES not in fact fit my 2015 Wrangler JK despite assurances that it would. As another buyer pointed out, this product requires significant modification to fit and does not resemble the product offered for sale.
B00BKW4440|1|would work well as a winch on a trailer to load with but on a atv or buggy or something it is junk. if you pull at any angle at all the fairlead is made of garbage steel and plastic bushings so it scars the rollers real bad and just collapses the bushings then the scaring on the roller frays the cable then cable breaks. used it twice and now im looking for a new one.
B0032I9XLY|5|Graet boots. Good quality at a good price!
B0093QKNCW|3|feels cheap. looks cheap would do the job if this didn't come broken.
B00JIGA390|5|fairly accurate. about a 0.2V difference, but its nice to give at least some estimate of what the voltage is.
B0033ZTAOQ|4|These are a lot bigger than I thought they would be. They are very good quality. ONLY reason for, four stars not five is because I do not have them up yet and  do not know how they stick. I will try to update later. Redoing kids rooms for Christmas.
B0002SR28S|5|Excellent
B002TS2ZSG|4|still have not figured out how to install it...but have not really tried either
B00A7MTEB2|5|I would recommend these to any suburban owner.
B000R4PFFO|4|So far it has been satisfactory in cleaning the upholstery on a brand new boat.
B0013HYAQE|5|Great products
B001CO4WA2|5|So so pleased with this coil! I forgot that leaving the key in the ON position with no engine running can leave the points in the distributor connected and cause a short in that system. Came out hours later to find wires and dizzy cap melted :(<br /><br />Bought this one because it came well recommended and didn't require an external resistor.<br /><br />Bought a new electronic ignition distributor, and swapped out the old coil with this Bosch Blue one, started right up, quicker and stronger than ever!!<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B001EOV45G|5|Perfect fit on my gl450
B001AJH1HK|5|Bought these mirrors more than a year ago and absolutely love them. I have used them to pull a 32 foot Crossroads Zinger Bunk trailer from Kansas/Oklahoma all the way to California - twice! The mirrors are easy to fasten onto my vehicle mirrors. You can position the clip-on mirror either horizontal or vertical. I've tried both ways and prefer the horizontal orientation. There is virtually no vibration even at 75-80 mph.  I've used this mirror on both a Chrysler Aspen and now on a 2013 GMC Yukon XL. Easy to attach, easy to remove. Great visibility. I looked at many clip-on mirrors, and very, very happy with this purchase.
B00KTHUDCY|2|only transmits 4 or less feet away from truck. replaced battery, thinking it was going out but did not fix issue.
B00NRVFCJS|5|Lights look great.  Just like the Premium Benz and/or BMW
B00UJ5YNYU|4|Haven't mounted it yet but tested the brightness impressed so far and feel rugged enough to survive most situations
B004VRR9MK|5|works well
B001C9QXBS|4|After installing this one, driving feeling is better  than that of the previous genuine part. Recommendable. But,regrefful to find minor scratch on the surface on delivery and box-packing is not much reliable.
B0055DMZYQ|4|The package arrived on time, but was slightly beat up. The item inside was in good shape. The quality of the seat is good and it did fit my Hisun 500ATV-2. The installation of the seat on the rear rack went easier than I thought it would, but the instructions supplied did not show how to wire the seat's supplied wire harness to the bike's wiring. The seat has plenty of room inside & provides a comfortable ride for the rear passenger.
B00RL43BXG|5|Great product quick shipping!
B00CGTVCIC|5|This cover fit the steering wheel on my 2005 Hyundai Elantra perfectly.  I has the feel of a steering wheel in a high end sports car!!  I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants to upgrade the look and feel of the steering wheel in their car.
B008G20RL6|5|perfect fit and plus they came with ALL the bulbs - great value!!
B00XQQAWF8|5|Overall great choice, only problem was the bulb out warning that happens in newer dodge vehicles, which is a simple fix with a capacitor.  Great light output, great look on vehicle
B00DG770Z2|5|I like it
B004VS88P6|1|These LOOK amazing. I wanted them to work for me so badly, but they just don't fit right. The drivers side was ok, I could've lived with it even though the black strip that goes between the plastic taillight and the trunk was put on very poorly and I had to reapply it. The passenger side did not match up flush to the car at all. So bummed. Great seller though. Was able to return without an issue.
B001THQX1S|4|Work great
B00TAF2VHQ|5|Excelent
B000NCWV2U|5|good for small fills in hard to reach places
B006G5C38U|5|Does the job well, and had no issues with installing it. Seems like its high quality and really happy about the purchase.
B00VQ3MUEY|4|Delivered as promised on stated time frame.
B003KLABUA|3|USE IT ON MY CAR N LEFT IT SHINE AND REMOVED SOME OF THE SWIRLS.
B008LUXS3M|4|Delivered as promised on stated time frame. Came in packaging and firs nicely in my truck.
B00VNJ49E0|2|Just came in the mail ,will not fit a 2013 volt  included adapters not the correct thread count.Will be returning.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Great waterproofing product @ relatively low price
B000BQW5LK|5|Worked like a charm.
B000C4087Y|1|Leaked oil. I'll stick to oem filters from now on.
B003AOHKLA|1|Its going back, buyer beware.  Its says this is stainless steel but i have a small rust spot on mine straight out of the package and the accessories (Screw caps) come with this are very cheap looking and do not match the frame.  I would expect more from a premium brand for 45 bucks
B0002SRGW0|3|The reciver and the installer are not deep enough to clear the threaded taper ends off the ball joints.
B0009N30EQ|4|great
B008NGZ8HS|3|Great small sticker for vehicle. In description the writer should have mentioned it had white background. I would have preferred a clear background.<br /><br />All the way!!!
B009IF2LEQ|5|Works great, I would recommend. :)
B005WGR22Q|5|A==
B00HTN3HRY|5|so far so good just used it this weekend now lets see if it last ten years
B00846A4T4|4|Ordered Friday.<br />Received the following Wednesday.<br />The hole where the metal ring goes thru seems like it can tear easy. Nothing drilling another hole can't fix if it happens. It's worth a buy.
B000WKAJ7M|5|Came in on time and can't beet the price
B008032QBA|4|It was the wrong fuel pump i had to send it back for a refund and order. Another one for a 97blazer not a 99
