B000F78UAU|5|I'm 9 months pregnant and put the chair together myself.  Very easy to put together. I'm short, so the chair is a nice size for me. My only complaint is one of the arm cushions has one button that doesn't fit properly. I still love the glider! ☺
B0048BP5RU|5|Love it! Have had for about 9 months now and still use daily with my 11 month old baby. I wish I could find a reasonably priced cover for it, but I have been able to put it through the washer and dryer a few times without incident.
B001CUPT76|3|good
B00E8KJYNC|4|Works great , was missing a piece and the company sent us a new one and were very nice and helpful
B000056JHW|5|Have used in the past for little ones to keep off the stairs. Purchased new one for dog to dry off in small hallway near back door and to section off rooms when needed. Nice that it is adjustable and has strong rubber stoppers.
B0050GD2FE|5|Fits perfect over stroller. Easy to use and store . Baby can still see very well and it doesn't bug her.
B000056HK2|5|This changing pad has been great.  It secured well (with screws that came with it) to the dresser top (it secures to the back of the dresser so that you don't have to ruin the furniture on top.)      We bought super soft changing pads at Pottery Barn Kids that fit this nicely.  We also put down a cloth diaper on top of the pad \\"just in case.\\"  We've found this to be helpful because throwing one of these cloth diapers into the wash is easier than removing the changing pad cover every time.)      Our baby is 9 mos. old now & squirming when on the changing pad.  The straps hold him well so if we turn for a second we're not panicked that he'd roll off.
B001QCIG16|5|My son loves it.  I can't get him out of the bathtub anymore without a fight.  He loves the different colors and the different ways of the water to get sprayed around.<br /><br />Great product for a great price.  Will purchase in the future for friends with kids as a gift.
B0058YYUFO|1|The fact that they can even call this a baby thermometer is laughable. I was expecting a thermometer that would read in 5 perhaps 10 seconds... this one takes about a minute to fully read. I bought this for myself when I was pregnant, but soon threw it away. Can you imagine taking a rectal temp for a full minute?!?!?<br />Save yourself the trouble and spend a few extra dollars for a quick read thermometer that reads in 5 or 10 seconds tops.
B00849L3QO|5|Well, it certainly has a nice design.<br />The straw will help the kids to drink water with fun, but I do hope there is another alternative to replace.
B00112L1FY|1|I did my daughters room in Classic Pooh, and I just had to have this mobile. I knew it wasn't a decorative, or engaging as some other ones, but it went with my theme and was oh-so-cute. First off it's wayyyyy over priced. It is basically just plastic with the characters hanging at the ends. There are many more decorative ones but it did go with my theme. The second thing I found (my husband found) is that you have to be strategic about how you hang the characters. Pooh weighs more then any of the others and if he is hung on the same side as Eeyore then the mobile hangs lopsided and won't rotate, but if you hang them opposite then each other it works ok. Pooh's foot does still get hung up on the rotations, but it will work around it. The thing that really made me mad  though is that it broke, today actually. We've had it about 5 months, and we've only used it about once or twice a week, and today the gears totally stripped and it will no longer wind up. My daughter has been totally engaged with it, but now I'm going to go buy one that's cheeper that will hopefully work longer then a couple times a week for 5 months.
B000I2WAY4|1|We have an odd problem with our cradle swing that noone else has mentioned.  The seat does not hang level from the frame.  The seat has two positions: one that allows the baby to rock side to side, and one that allows the baby to rock front to back(the swing always swings side to side: to adjust the direction of the swing for the baby, you rotate the seat 90 degrees, and have the baby face to the left in the swing assembly).  When the seat is arranged to rock side to side, the tilt doesn't matter (the baby is simply leaning back more than one would expect).  But when the seat is rotated 90 degrees, so that the seat rocks front to back, the seat is tilted at an angle (i.e. the right side of the seat is lower than the left side), and the baby bunches up against the right side of the seat (imagine sitting on a chair that is on a slight hill, or that is angled; you would 'roll' to the low side).  I couldn't see any manufacturing flaw, and there is really no way for our assembly to cause this.  We'll be returning the swing and finding something else.
B000V88HJM|4|It is also good to use，but not very good with a magnifying glass~Suitable for the baby，Good choice.Very cheap.Holding feel good.
B002UD661C|5|I used these pads primarily for my 18 month old while they were learning to stay dry all night. When there were accidents in the middle of the night these pads would often prevent that middle of the night bed stripping and changing of the sheets. Just be careful after so many washes (I don't even know how many because I used it with 2 kids) the material is no longer water proof.
B0013KS8FU|5|I purchased these sheets to match the comforter for my nephew's birthday.  I heard they are adorable!  A Must Buy!  Thank You
B00NTUYVPI|5|Great quality!! I use it on my UPPABABY VISTA 2015 and it works great! It sits up nicely and holds my iphone 6 and galaxy in the front mesh pockets just fine. It has enough space for small toys, keys etc
B00784E96C|5|I love these pictures & got so many compliments from people who came to visit my son when he was born. :)
B000058CC4|4|This positioner works great.  It is adjustable and keeps my baby from rolling over onto his belly.
B004WAXE3E|4|This gown is comfortable, and although it covers a huge range of sizes, it actually looks flattering on a pregnant body!  My only issue with this gown is that I ordered the Heather Gray one and what I got is definitely *black*.  The packaging says Heather Gray, so it appears to be the right product -- the colors just aren't true.  But I'm going to keep it!  The material isn't super soft, but it's nicer than a hospital gown, and much more cute and modest.  I'll feel a little more confident packing this in my hospital bag!  EDITED 2/1/12 to add:  This thing was a success!  All of the nurses complimented it, and it worked out wonderfully with the monitors I needed attached to my belly and for the epidural.  I took it home and washed it... good as new and now I can store it for next time (IF there is a next time, ha ha!).
B0006ZZB0I|5|This item was purchased for a friend. I remember opening it up and having to try it myself before giving it to it's rightful owner.<br />It is nearly instantaneous boiling.
B007ZDZU2I|1|The clasp broke the first day my daughter wore it. It was a very flimsy clasp so I shall be returning this item.
B00ENUWFJC|5|A great buy! A secure seat which serves its purpose. Lifts and secures a child and allows for proper seat belt wearing.<br />Excellent construction, sturdy but light enough to carry and switch between cars.<br />The only complain we received from our granddaughter, is that it comes in blue and blue is for &#34;boys&#34; .... Oh well ...
B0018Z6910|1|the product arrived with a defective motor. the lowest setting is a rapid speed that makes noise as it swings (annoying clicking sound) and tends to overstimulate the little one so he never sleeps in it.     the best features are how comfy and safe it is. also the reflefctive mirror above seeems to amuse even my 7 week old.
B005DSA34C|5|Since my younger kid is two years old now, I was wondering about what to do with my Leachco snoogle body pillow. A friend suggested me to put in my kids bedroom, in the floor, for them to play, read a book and so one. But I would like something more childlike to fit their room. And this cover was perfect for that. I made a special space for them in the floor, with a carpet and some pillows. It fits perfectly there!
B000J6CDY6|4|Purchased as a gift.
B00005MP2I|5|These are very large in size.  I actually cut mine in half to use them.  They are absolutely leak proof.
B0007V644S|3|The powder.fresh smell is too strong for me. Baby keeps sneezing around this product.
B000056OUH|5|This is THE best way to sterilize bottles, bottle pieces, pacifiers, and breastpump parts.  It is quick and easy.  Forget boiling water or whatever else, get the microwave sterilizer.
B0009RNXNA|5|We have used this bag once and loved having it. It fit our Chicco Keyfit carseat with base no problem with plenty of room to spare. The backpack option was very nice as well to be able to carry that with carry on luggage and our baby.  This is an update - we got the Chicco NextFit carseat now that our daughter is bigger and it just barely fits in this. You have to position it right - but you can make it fit.
B003NURLGU|3|This is an okay brush, it gets the job done but is a little more work since the bristles are so soft.  The other end I fell is a waste, haven't found it useful at all.
B004HMUIN6|4|Love how soft and flexible these spoons are. So far, they clean easily and baby has no problem eating from them. Haven't tried any others so I cannot compare to competitive brands. The only \\"problem\\" is that they do dip quite low so baby cannot get all the food off it yet. I'm sure he will learn. This isn't a deal breaker for me because the flexibility in the spoon allows me to easily scrape it off back into the bowl.
B004PKNRMY|1|I brought a seven sling from the website. I was bummed when I received it because it was too small. I contacted their customer service only to find out that once you open the package, that it can not be returned. And if you want to exchange it for a bigger size, you have to pay a $10 \\"size change insurance\\" fee. What a rip off. Stuck with a wrap that I can not use. Very disappointed.
B000UGG99K|5|Good Read
B0082J3SUA|5|This is my go to bid in my diaper bag because if it gets dirty, I can just rinse it off in the sink and not have to worry about it getting other items in my diaper bag dirty with food. Rolls up too for easy packing. Loved it so much that I bought another to keep in kitchen for easy to grab bibs that don't need to go in the washing machine.
B008WNV4J8|5|I needed a bigger diaper bag with the birth of my second child. I have a 2 year old and an infant. This bag has been working out for 2. I have tons of diapers, snacks, receiving blankets, bottles, sippy cup, all sorts of wipes, toys, clothes, first aid kit, ect. It all fits with tons of room to spare. The bag is heavy, but the straps are comfortable. I love the stylish look of the bag. This is my 5th diaper bag and its a winner with tons of pockets and space for everything.  Edit: I didnt use this bag for long. It is very heavy compaired to other diaper bags.
B00BZAKI0Q|5|I highly recommend this item. It take away the clumps from the formula<br />best purchase
B005MGXIH4|5|This is a fantastic growth chart!  The only thing I wish it had would be a nice wooden-type hanger so that the chart could be hung so that the child could monitor his/her growth.  I would highly recommend this item.
B00101TXPG|4|I am happy with this monitor.  It's small and thin so it's not clunky.  The sound is superb and always clear.  The light on the baby end of the monitor is very bright and, like other reviewers, I have had to hide the light from my 6 week old baby girl.  The speaker end of the monitor is a little annoying in that it falls down easily because it is so thin.  The bottom of it should have been made WIDER allowing it to stand up easily without having to pay so much attention to how you place it.  But the important thing is that it is very clear sounding.
B0072AN3LO|4|This was requested from my son and daughter in law for their newborn,  It's safety rating was very high.  Problem tho that even in my son's large SUV in order for it to fit,  the front seat has to be advanced very far forward leaving little or no room for a passenger.  Fortunately my daughter in law is tiny and can fit there
B004LD6VLO|2|Battery eater but great projection. Wish it had an optional DC outlet.
B002MA9VXI|5|Works perfectly!!!!!!!
B0028H3ACS|5|Great condition! Exactly what we wanted.
B000NVXBVG|5|Every time my daughter receives a stuffed animal as a gift, I can barely suppress a groan. What is it about them? The kids love to snuggle with them, but there's a limit to how many can fit in a bed, much less a closet!    That's why I love the Boon Oval Animal Bag. I bought the pink one for my daughter, and we pulled out all the stuffed animals I'd tucked away in various places to fill it up. It holds a TON of animals. In fact, as many as we had, we didn't actually get it filled enough for it to be as firm as a typical bean-bag chair. I padded out some of the extra space with extra winter blankets.    The animal bag is VERY well made. There are three entrance points, allowing the child to spot a desired animal and easily extract it from the bag. The zipper pulls are large plastic ovals, easy to grab even for little hands. And the softness of the bag is really fantastic. My 1-year-old son loves to run over to it, collapse on it, and roll around on the soft \\"fur.\\"    If you're considering a bean-bag chair and want to avoid the potential danger of the fillers, the Boon Oval Animal Bag is a less expensive and safer alternative with a secondary purpose.    And the best part? Now the next time someone gives my daughter a stuffed animal, I can smile just as much as she does.    It also is available in green for those who aren't fans of pink.
B0038W0JI0|1|We've had Britax car seats in the past and they were great. The brand is well known to be a leader in safety. Britax seats are expensive but how much money is your child's safety worth? This seat may be safe but that is where the good qualities end. We've had it a year and I curse this seat every time I use it.  Pros:  safety  Cons:  The seat has a very funny shape so it does not fit the contour of the rear seats of any of our cars. This contributes to installation headaches.   I use the cars safety belts because I've read quite a few things that say installation using the car seat belts is safer than using the Latch belts. Well, using the car seat belt in this seat is next to impossible. You must route the belt down, in, around, out, up, around, down, etc. The belt is a twisted mess by the time you are ready to lock it in place. Ok, start over, again, and again, and again. Once you finally get this seat in place, the belt is impossible tighten because of all the routing up, under, over, etc. It is plain impossible to get this seat in.  The Britax harness routes in a way that it is pressed into the car's seats. This makes tightening and loosening the harness very difficult.  The car seat's handles are held on at the top by a metal bolt through a plastic hole. I broke one off trying to put the car seat in the car.  The worst part is the seat is very uncomfortable. We hear endless complaints about \\"my back hurts\\". This started happening as soon as we purchased this seat. The problem happens when you raise the head rest. The padding goes up with the head rest making the top part of the back support thicker then the lower part. It is a ridiculous design and I can see why we hear complaints every time we are in the car.  This seat was a total waste of money and is going right into the garbage. Avoid at all cost.
B002MN3JY2|5|The pads are soft and very comfortable. Much nicer than the similar product made from bamboo. They do stain if you use any lansolin cream but I am not too bothered by that as they still work just fine.
B00XUYWEPM|4|The quality is very good and it is as described. Very well built. The only thing is that I have a Maclaren stroller and when I put it on I can not put it straight.
B00ANG2CCU|5|Got this for my cousin and her little one on the way!<br /><br />She and I LOVE turtles si I think she will love it :)
B00G6G3O3W|1|Defective. Cheap. Badly made. These cubes only glow when you press down on the button. They don't glow on their own, which defeats the whole purpose. Total waste of money. I decided to try LiteCubes, which cost more but work perfectly and are totally worth it. When you put one of these LED cubes next to a LiteCube, you see just how crappy, these are. This is one of those cases where you really do get what you pay for.
B000QFEQL8|5|Functional and easy to clean.  Good quality!
B00CMJ226M|5|these are a little different from others i have ordered as they don't have a double compartment - but still very please as they are very roomy and sturdy - so am happy with this purchase
B0012KUDPE|5|We bought approximately 120 of these about 10-12 YEARS AGO to cover our basement play area and little exercise room.  (They were about $3 per tile back then on Amazon.  Looks like about $5 per tile now.)  We have 3 kids that spent countless hours playing in the basement over the years.  We also had a golden retriever on them for about 7-8 years. (Poor girl went to doggie heaven at age 16.)  Anyway, the kids played on them, walked on them with mom's old spiked heels when they played dress-up (this put small indentations in them but never punctured them), dogs claws were on them, toys, etc.  Our dog had a few &#34;accidents&#34; on them and the kids spilled drinks on them, too.  But each time that happened we just wiped the mess up and, if necessary, took them outside, wiped them with soapy water, sprayed them off with the hose, let them dry in the sun, and put them right back in place...no smells afterward.  And the vacuum works great on them.  They were also easy to cut with scissors.  We cut out half circles to get pieces flush against pipes, and cut some to fit snug against the wall.  After all that I just sold them on Craigslist in less than 5 hours for $1 each (I guess I underpriced them, bummer).  They were great for us!
B004HFQOLI|5|very good
B003Y2UZ42|5|This is a medium sized diaper bag, black with white flowers.  The stitching appears to be well done, and strong.  The bag is quilted cotton and polyurethane on the inside for easy wipe down cleaning.  There are two pockets on the side that will accommodate a sippy cup or bottle.  The flap on the front of the bag has three deep pockets, as well as a latch to clip on keys or pacifiers and make them easily accessible.  The flap is held closed by two magnets.  There is also a zippered pocket in the back, which is where I store the changing pad.  The pad itself is well sized, poly on one side and thin terry cloth on the other, so it can be easily cleaned, but still soft for baby to lay on. The top has a zippered closure.<br />Inside the bag is a deceptively large amount of space.  One side of the bag has three, kind of narrow, but deep pockets, while the other side has two larger spaces.  This would be my only drawback.  I think the bag would accommodate more if the side with three pockets instead had the same two large that the other side has.  Still, I am able to stow several snacks, a change of outfit, toys, a bunch of diapers, wipes, and wet bag, (I use cloth.)  None of the pockets on this bag are insulated<br />I was looking for a bag that didn't look like a diaper bag, and this fits the bill.  I wanted something that I could replace my purse with, but still have some style.  I was originally going to buy a Timi and Leslie bag for this reason, but just couldn't bring myself to spend $150+ on a bag that wasn't even real leather.  Like others have said, this is very similar to a Vera Bradley type bag, but I think the pattern is more fun than most of the VB bags I have seen.  An added bonus is that it is machine washable, so your bag isn't ruined when juice is spilled or PB&J gets smushed into it.<br />Before this, I was using a backpack and hated how everything just ended up in a pile in the bottom.  With my second child due any day, I needed something that would giveme greater organization.  I also love how lightweight the bag is.  Even loaded with supplies, it is comfortable on my shoulder and doesn't slip off, like so many other bags.  While I wish it had stroller straps, it doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome to carry, so I'm not too worried.<br />Overall, this is an excellent value.  Well made and stylish.
B001LNOZH4|5|I bought this for my 6th child after reading many reviews. I wish I would have had this for the other 5! It is GREAT. He LOVES to sleep in his car seat and when we're going somewhere, he's snug as a bug and his head isn't flopping everywhere. BTW: He was 6 lbs. 12 oz. when he was born and 6lbs. 1oz. at his 2 day check up. Now he's 7'5 at 2 weeks.
B002964QZ8|1|It may be soft and snuggly, but it is the smallest blanket I've ever seen! Yes, I see the dimensions but had to measure the tiny piece of fabric to believe it was 16x16. It may be big enough for a little doll but not for any baby I know. Very disappointed with this purchase. Had I not detached the bow I would have returned it immediately.
B00C7JW3WK|5|I've only been using these for 2 months, but so far, so good! I don't think they would fit a 7 lb baby, but my baby was 9 lbs 11 oz and they fit her at about 2 weeks old. It's probably best to wait until the umbilical cord falls off anyways. I haven't had any problems with leaking, diaper rash, or stains, so here are my recommendations: I use biokleen detergent with a presoak and then dry the inserts on low. The covers I air dry. I use grovia magic stick as a diaper rash preventative. And I use biokleen bac out to prevent stains/smells in the diaper bag before laundering. I also don't always use the pocket function; by putting the insert on top, I can conserve covers with less frequent laundering. All in all these are great diapers and FAR cheaper than some of the alternatives!
B006P3HP9A|5|My baby hated the wet feel of the Grovia cotton soakers, and while I liked their absorbency and gussets, they took forEVER in the dryer. These have the same construction but are trimmer, dry faster n the dryer, and re comfy for baby. The lining is hemp and cotton; just the surface touching the baby s he synthetic wicking fabric, so they're still nice and absorbent.<br /><br />I do like having less laundry by washing just soakers for wets (I also use pocket diapers=more laundry)<br /><br />Just wish they were not so spendy.
B00NFY534Q|5|These are very high quality and they look awesome.
B0088QU1NY|5|I gave this inflatable bathtub 5 stars.  I purchased this bathtub for my granddaughter when she was several months old. I'm sorry she has outgrown it, but I'll be passing it on to another family member.  The product states it is suitable for ages 6 - 18 months, we used it for almost 2 years.  It was easy to inflate and fit perfectly in the bathtub.  The temperature display was easy to read and reliable. My granddaughter was able to splash during bath time, but the tub kept her from slipping and sliding around.  It has a nice deep pocket to hold shampoo or other necessities to help keep things within reach during bathtime. Did I mention the adorable garanimals all over it.<br /><br />You can deflate the tub if you're traveling. I purchased this for my home, so we never deflated it.  We emptied the tub, allowed it to air dry and than stuck it in the bathroom closet. I can see why this tub received the 2011 Seal of Approval  from The National Parenting Center.  I would highly recommend it.
B002L3T9Z6|3|I'm pleased with these, but the openings are very small so they easily get stretched on the roll bar on the stroller and car seat.  Not a huge deal, but something to note.
B0038JE5Y2|4|While this at first appears to be a simple ice cube tray, one soon realizes that OXO has once again managed to make an ordinary product into an innovative gem by using the best materials (dishwasher safe, sturdy) and adding a genius idea (the oddly shaped lid allowing easy removal of a single cube without risk of spilling others all over the floor).<br /><br />If you overfill the holes, you may have trouble removing the lid.  And the lid makes it take up more room in the freezer.  Otherwise an excellent product.
B00GJG8CTK|1|These are already stratched after 2 days of use and now look very cheap on an expensive pram. I'm one disappointed Mumma.
B000WU5N9G|4|We have had this bouncer for over three months and are very pleased with it.  As for the vibrations, they are strong when you first change the battery, but slow down after a few uses.  My baby never minded the stronger vibrations.  We have also had no problems with the loudness of the battery pack.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes more simple designs for baby products, and is not interested in \\"vomb\\" sounds or various annoying baby songs.
B001PP3AAQ|4|We purchased this gate to fill a large doorway in our house and wanted something pressure mounted and not permanently installed.     This gate was easy to install, though a bit of pain to adjust the width. Once you have the desired width it's definitely easy to get in and out of the doorway, but you certainly won't want to constantly use it in doorways of different sizes.     My son pulls himself up on this gate all the time, his own version of a chin up, and the gate has never moved. My dog jumps over the gate every day, using the top bar as a boost, and the gate has never moved. The only times the gate has really seemed to come lose is when we hit it with a leg when stepping over it.     It's definitely gotten the job done for our needs!
B000MRK5MO|5|I was so relieved to find these bottles since they don't contain the BPA like almost every other bottle on the market.  My baby does very well with them--hardly any gas, hardly any interruptions during feeding--they are fantastic.  WORTH EVERY CENT.
B00ANZ5J44|5|it looks so nice and stylish, yet practical and big, not huge, you won't need any other bags, just this one and you are ready to go, and you have all what you want
B00CXVG710|5|Adorable addition to my son's J&TNP Toddler bed theme! My son got so excited when he saw it. He's 3 years old and the pillow is too big for him to actually sleep on, but he loves it either way!
B001CB3JPE|5|Couldn't find a rain shield for our Kolcraft Countours 3 Wheel Stroller which is a rather wide stroller. This fits great.  Good Value for the price.
B000E0KN5I|5|This was a Baby Gift and it arrived earlier then expected and in excellent condition!!!!!!!!!!!
B00LI5RCLQ|5|added photos of parents to be at baby shower all around and put 'food labels' on food table
B008BRVTH2|5|This set it too cute! i have the nursery set up and i get compliments from everyone! it is even cuter in person! i washed and dried everything and it held up perfectly in the wash. I would highly recommend this!
B000YQMWLU|5|Absolutely amazing! I had all sorts of problems getting my baby to latch because on of my nipples was not big enough, and a bit flat. This guard made it possible for me to nurse my baby without pain and perfect latch
B005P07HS8|5|I absolutely love these boob pads. They are super soft. They lay flat so that you can't even tell you are wearing them. Even after washing they remain flat. Before I knew about Bamboobies I had purchased pads from another brand... they were thick and itchy, after washing they crinkled up. I have since ordered and reordered bamboobies because I love them so much. I have also given them to an expecting mother because I didn't want her to have to suffer like I did with crappy pads. Thank you for such a great product.
B002TOKHOO|4|The size of the hood is great for newborn as it's not too big. It dries up quickly as it's not thin.
B0007V644S|5|Great little bags that work great as well.  I got these to keep the smell under control and they work out great.
B003ZFPRHS|5|fun, accurate, and easy to use!
B008KCR7VK|5|We bought this to go with our BOB car seat and it's very easy to install.
B000YDDF6O|5|So cute. Very pleased
B00BEVF1W6|5|Easy to install and awesome quality. So happy I went w the 5 point harness booster. Love the easy click install
B0045VA3SO|4|Great for newborns and then I used the pillow alone to sport the head
B00H7Y576E|4|Great play yard, sturdy and plenty of pockets to store the baby's stuff.  The only downside to it is the mattress which is not as supportive as I'd like it to be.  I had to put in my own mattress and covers on top.
B001KW8DDI|4|We purchased this item to assist my son in his potty training endeavors.  We have a &#34;two room&#34; bathroom so there are two switches to turn on when you are 3 yrs old (and need all the lights on to go).  We put this on the switch for the actually bathroom stall and it has been a huge help.  He no longer has to move the step stool from one switch to the other etc.  We also have one on his bedroom light and on the playroom light switch.  Well worth the money and easy to install.  I gave it 4 stars only because while it does &#34;glow in the dark&#34; for a period of time, it does not glow all night.  It needs to be recharged with light.  That was not a big deal to us as my son knows where the switches are, but could not reach them without a chair/stool etc.  This is much safer than the alternative &#34;chairs&#34; he may try to use.
B002LGR8JW|5|Seems like good quality, thick, and soft. Love the pattern and the colors.
B008KW8IPY|5|This chair is perfect for my 18 month old boy. He loves it. It is very light so it needs to put up against a wall or another piece of furniture. Its well padded but I can definitely see it tipping over easily if he was standing on it pushing the back. Also I don't like the bumps on the front of the chair where the padding ends but it doesn't effect the function of the chair, just looks funny. Overall I'm very pleased with this chair for the price!
B00078ZHPS|3|While ultra soft and a great fit, this product is CHEAP and tore after 2 months of light use and washing in the washing machine about every other week. I was very satisfied with the product until it tore right in the middle of the changing area. You get what you pay for, the good price means it doesn't last long!
B002WDEIVA|5|Breastfeeding is messier than I anticipated.  This cover protects my boppy pillow from urp, and it isn't some obnoxious pattern.
B007NG5UF4|5|Very good sound quality and it is very sensitive to low noises, range is good also
B00A75C4FC|5|It protects little heads!  Our kid liked to chew of them….
B000PJ8Q1G|5|I love the quality of this cup, as well as the pictures on it.  There are less pieces than some sippy cups, which makes it easier to clean.  This has become my daughter's favourite cup.
B006NTY1G6|5|We got 10 panels in total, but usually use 8 of them for a circle in the family room.  We use the other two panels to block off wide doorways by sliding them between the wall and heavy enough objects to keep them from being pulled or pushed over. I am going to build some brackets to mount to doorways to clip to the gates directly, which will allow us to block off 2-3 rooms as a safe baby-proofed zone instead of small area.  They should sell brackets for this actually!
B0052QYLUM|4|Overall I was pleased with this monitor.<br /><br />Pros: The picture, night vision, range, and sound sleep features were all exceptional and several people who have watched my daughter have commented on what a great picture it has. We also found it to be very user friendly.<br /><br />Cons: If you take this monitor from place to place regularly (like I do) take care to protect it well when traveling, because compared to some other monitors it has more parts that are vulnerable to breaks (antennas, hinging camera, etc). But we just put it in a plastic container when we traveled, and that seemed to do the trick. Also, not sure how this compares to other monitors, but our power will occasionally flicker, and if it does, this monitor does not have a back up battery, so the camera turns off and we had to quietly sneak in to turn it back on a couple times when she was sleeping. Just a small thing to consider.
B005537IFW|5|My grandbaby loves it! So soft
B000056OUX|4|This net is great. We're using it to keep our daughter from sticking her head between balusters in the gate that secures out 2nd story, sliding glass door which leads to nothing (instead of a deck). However, the strings looked super sloppy to me, so instead we used Darice Locking Cable Ties, 12-Inch, Clear. See the picture. we cut the excess, and this produced a very clean look.
B002DN8HCK|5|We really love this sippy cup. It's pretty heavy and our daughter (now 10 months) still can't lift it, so we just started her on the straw attachment right away and it works great. Sure, she spits half of the water out all over herself while trying to drink from it...but at least she's getting the hang of it! ;-)
B00GQO0KMW|5|My daughter loves this !!! Great buy!
B001QGKXA4|2|I actually like the organizer itself a lot, but there is no way these suction cups are going to work on our tile, which is just slightly textured. I've tried on multiple occasions for long periods of focused time to get this stick, even using rubbing alcohol as one reviewer suggested on the tile and suction cups, but the cups just slide right off. I also tested the cups out on some shiny tiles we have in another room and they stuck perfectly. Sadly, we don't have such tiles in our bathrooms so we can't use this how we intended. Instead, we ended up using some black twist ties to hang it from a washcloth rail in our shower. It seems to be okay like this, but wasn't what I wanted when I purchased it and definitely doesn't look as nice as it could. Check your tile for any slight texture at all before purchasing.
B004VL2VRY|5|The image is perfect.
B00AHPZZGC|5|We've used this seat for our daughter, who is now 10 months (we got the seat/stroller combo). We had no idea which one to get and went with the Keyfit 30 after reading so many positive reviews - and we haven't been disappointed! Installs very easily; I love the &#34;click&#34; as it slides into the base so I know it's in there securely. Very well made; feels sturdy; works like a champ.<br /><br />One precaution is that this seat is kind of heavy, compared to other models, and especially as your kid approaches the upper weight limits.... oof. You're going to get a great arm workout each time.<br /><br />I would absolutely pick this seat all over again.
B003ODZPI2|4|After one week of trying to breastfeed with a stack of four pillows, my back was killing me.  I was getting less nervous about dropping the baby off the precariously balanced stack, but still limited in where I could sit while feeding (not in bed, because the floor was too far away).  Not having a nursing pillow was not working out.<br /><br />My Brest Friend is the only nursing pillow I've tried.  It is a huge improvement over standard bed pillows or nothing.<br /><br />Plusses:<br />- Much better than a stack of standard bed pillows or just holding baby up with no pillows.  Within three feedings, I felt much better about using the pillow, and my back did not hurt some much after feeding.  This is way more comfortable than any improvised home alternatives.<br />- Cheaper than buying waterproof covers for a stack of standard bed pillows.  After all, if you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  I didn't care what color the cover on the nursing pillow was, so I just picked the color that was on sale.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- The cover for the My Brest Friend is not waterproof, and the inside pillow material is made of foam that absorbs moisture.  If you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  That's going to go through the cover and into the pillow.  You can pat the foam with water, but the pillow will be wet for a while, and eventually I suspect the baby will start to smell the accumulated spills.  I realize that most of the manufacturing cost for this is the material used for the cover, but any type of waterproof layer, even a cheap vinyl cover under the cloth would have been very welcome.<br />-  Boppy has a waterproof cover www.amazon.com/Boppy-Water-Resistant-Protective-Cover/dp/B002WDEIVA/ , but I couldn't even find one for sale separately for My Brest Friend.<br />- I have to hunch over to nurse with this, or lift the baby's head a few inches off the pillow.  For perspective, I'm 5ft 6inch, have a long torso, woresize 8 before pregnancy and only gained 10 pounds from pregnancy.  The other reviewer who mentioned hunching over said she was 4ft something with a slight build.  In a sense, it's a one-size-fits-all pillow, and plus size reviewers say it's great for them.  With thicker thighs, the height might work out better.  Maybe I'm supposed to have my feet up on something, so that I can control the height of the pillow with my thighs.  That sort of works, but it angles the pillow so that baby slides into me, and it's alarming for both of us.<br /><br />Other:<br />- I suspect a nursing pillow is only for the newborn phase.  Once the baby develops neck muscles, I think he will be able to do more of the work supporting himself up.  Also, people breast feed in public with nursing covers, but I have never seen someone carrying a nursing pillow around for portable breastfeeding.  So, I suspect the nursing pillow is for short term use, and will be outgrown in a few months.  This may mitigate issues with not having a waterproof cover.<br /><br />If you plan to breastfeed, definitely get a nursing pillow.  This one was a huge improvement over standard bed pillows, and a big enough improvement that I am not going to try others.  As you shop, if you see any nursing pillows that have a waterproof cover, or any waterproof covers for popular pillows, those are worth investigating and paying more for.
B00028XJNA|4|These are great, no washing bottles everyday and you just throw them in the freezer if not using the milk in a day or so.  Wish I had these with my 10 yr old and 6 yr old.
B00OX0JLP8|2|One of the trays was cracked the first time and when replacement was sent, it came with a cracked tray as well.
B008B8YZSG|4|Good quality, it's easy and comfortable to wear, the little ones like it, needs some practice to buckle up the upper rear belt.
B000YFRCG6|5|Love the color. It's a bright Minty green. Looks great with pink. Blanket is nice and soft too. Can't wait til baby gets to use it.
B00PFZJKW4|5|Excelente
B00F8NKKZO|5|Very nice product.  Unfortunately my son doesn't like it so we don't use it much.  We'll give it another try when he's a bit older.
B000F78UAU|2|I love the chair but, the bottom of the chair or rocker never rock smoothly, it make cracking noises, when you rock, it would feel like it would bump, finally the rocker broke, one of the middle round wood pieces broke off,  I love the color and the chair never was right the day it arrived, I was just one of those unlucky buyers, I bought a lemon and lost money on this item.
B002T44LZU|3|Great idea, but my daughter point-blank refused to wear it.
B001FWY1H0|4|Cute bouncy cow, yet smaller than I had anticipated. Great for a small 1 1/2 to 2 year old child.
B00VWDTS7A|5|Worked just as described
B000WUB9O4|5|it's a good stuff for my baby. very strong and i think it's can use for my next children thank you
B000MVQBG4|3|Ya know... it works well but after a while got really dirty and moldy. Ive lost hope that ill ever be able to find a good bath toy storage system. But I will say this is the best one ive seen so far.
B00C7VQ8GU|4|This was easier than a snap to set up while we were traveling.  Is a bit heavy but worth every cent.  The mesh all the way down on all four sides gives peace of mind that there will be no risk of suffocation.  Sheet works well for sleeping, have not used this for play yet.  Would reccomend in a heartbeat!
B00ANXMOVW|5|great soft sheet for older toddlers. i like to keep my sheet on the mattress so it is easy and fast to set up crib at hotel, but the sheet is thicker and makes it hard to close in carrying case.
B00EM5D4KM|5|Works perfectly
B00O5IU8SM|5|Excellent product. Perfect handy size monitor. I bought it few days ago, very useful and comfortable. Clear night view and sound. Now my baby is safe with me all time. I can see him all time.
B00005BMDX|5|love these bottles
B004FQ086G|2|I really wanted to love this cup but I hate it. It's super cute but it basically ends there.  If you want a weighted straw, go with the Zoli Cup.  The weighted straw here is pointless if the kid tries to tilt the cup up because the straw is still stiff.  The zoli cup has a weighted ball on the end and can get every last drop out of the cup in any direction.  The clear plastic on this cup also seems like the cheapest of all the plastic cups we own. Yes, the straw and cup is easier to clean than most straw/sippies but you still have to use the little brush to get through all of the junk. There are too many pieces after you take it apart, so I keep misplacing stuff. I won't be buying this again.  We prefer the safe sippy 2 in 1 now.
B002UXQRES|4|Bags are strong and close well, but there are two things I prefer about the Lansinoh bags over these.  First, I prefer the straight sides of the Lansinoh bags for storage, vs. the tapered bottom of the Nuk bags.  Second, I can write easily on the Lansinoh bags with a ball point pen, vs. needing a permanent marker for the Nuk bags.  Nothing fatal - I will use up my supply of these - but I won't purchase them again.
B006XD9JG4|4|I'm still new to cloth diapering but so far I think I prefer fabrics that wick away the moisture. Think that might be more important than having organic fabric next to baby's skin. Maybe this depends on skin sensitivity I'm not sure yet. These take longer to dry in the drier than the other BG diapers but well made, easy to use.
B0024FAWSE|1|Just received my gate today and it was broken! Very displeased that now we are going to have to super glue some pieces just so we can use it.
B00AM5NTIS|5|Great way to feed lil ones that can use a pouch! My daughter-in-law is excited to get these for my granddaughter! THANK YOU!
B004C053BA|3|I bought this for my son in the hopes that he would take to it.  However, I was unable to have any luck with this or several other brands I have tried.  Overall, the bottle is exactly as described.  It is uniquely designed, but just like any other bottle, in my opinion.
B0043SE83A|5|They're very durable and my son loves them. I'm using them to fill a big blow up pool.
B0043G1MH2|4|We love, love, love the Kinderglo nightlights! We have used one in my son's room since he was born and with every day use, it lasted about 2 years before we had to order a new one. I love having the option of where to put it and the fact that it can either stay on one color or go through the rainbow. My son just loves his and we purchased another one for our new little baby boy. Definitely recommend--only gave 4 stars b/c you have to buy a new one if the light fizzles out (vs. replacing a bulb/batteries).
B004LWZZ6W|5|Just as described.  Our little girl will have a fun time playing with them when she is old enough.
B00CUF69EY|3|I like these burp clothes. 100% cotton is hard to find at places like Babies R Us.  They work well, but they aren't substantial enough for the particularly rough days.  I prefer the Gerber terry backed clothes.
B002UXQRES|3|It's very hard to label the bag!! Neither a ballpen nor a marker works. I think Lansinoh's storage bags are much better!
B00DBWK2DO|4|This crib is an amazing crib. Very sturdy, well built and clean modern look. I am very happy with the crib itself. There is nothing wrong with the crib. The crib is awesome. Did I mention the crib is very nice? It is a nice crib.<br /><br />The only thing, and I hate to even mention but it really bothers me, is there are a lot of stickers. I know, I know, all baby related gear has thousands of warnings and disclaimers and notices. I also realize that many of these are required by law for safety concerns and liability. I also realize that I am not the first to lament these labels and stickers being on products. Just be aware that what you see in the photos is plastered with quite a few stickers that are not subtle, small or easily removed.<br /><br />On the white panels at the bottom there are quite a few stickers facing the outside of the crib. They are on the non-exposed sides as well which doesn't bother me at all. So my bigger gripe is that I decided to take a sticker off of one of the sides. Bad idea! I pride myself in being able to take off sticky labels and stickers with care. Maybe I am a bit OCD about this but I enjoy clean and non stickered products. Regardless, this sticker was not only difficult to remove but also took off some of the white finish on the side panel! [sigh...] So brand new crib, with a blemish spot on it. My wife freaked out.<br /><br />I cleaned up the area as best I could and used some white paint to touch it up and it is fine. Not great, fine. Most would not even notice but I do. You can kind of still see where the paint isn't the same finish. It still bothers me but what can I do. My advice for buyers, leave the stickers on the crib unless you want to potentially damage the finish of the crib.
B005OSHTXO|4|I love the baskets that come with this changing table.  They make for nice storage, and I can put soiled clothes directly into the linen hamper, which is nice.  I read other reviews that said the table had a strong chemical/paint odor at first, which I noticed too, but this went away after a few days.  The only negative I would say is that it is slightly darker than other espresso finishes, so it is not as good of a match to our other nursery furniture as I had hoped, but it is only noticeable if you really look closely.  I also purchased a different changing table pad, one that was curved, since the one that came with this table was flat.  Overall, a pretty great choice.
B001ARYDFA|5|Excellent transaction! Fast service! I love it! Thank you so much!
B004Y42682|2|This seemed extremely cheap. I thought it would be thicker and more durable than it seemed. Definitely wouldn't have bought it if I had personally seen it. The cushion isn't very thick and it seemed like my baby was extremely uncomfortable while on it. I think I used this twice before I got rid of it. Not worth the money
B008L1D4JY|5|Soft. Easy to wash. Great for pre school or kindergarten nap time. My daughter loves it.
B00G34TIDW|5|great
B0072U9GTM|5|Super cute. Worked well, though it was not poop tested. Doesn't get bulky or bloated like disposables. And fits my little guy that was too small for disposables.
B0006FHB5Q|4|These handles are easy to place and use on tile, not painted walls. Safe and actually works. It will do the trick if you need a little assistance.
B00LFRCP4Q|5|gave to my cousin as a new baby gift and she said she liked it very much....she is going to get another one for the second car :)
B002VWZU7S|5|honestly. this and the giraffe from bright starts. these two car toys and you don't need any of the taggies or the boring kids toys that will ultimately end up wasting your money (totally wasted a few bucks on uninteresting toys, can't you tell?) stick with these two and i promise you, you'll have a happy baby.
B006OKS994|5|This is perfect for my 2 year old between the transition of high chair and full size chair!<br /><br />Love the product and would recommend to others.
B004BKJCO0|4|Very luxuriously soft and warm. Good size to wrap around your upper body when snuggled on couch. For the price though it should be 'jumbo' enough to cover your whole body;) Would make a great kids blanket at this size though.
B002M77N22|5|This is perfect for new Mom's. Its a wonderful update to the very old version of a bassinette. Easy to move, baby is stable inside of it, has protective padding that can be removed layer by layer as baby grows and it rocks all by itself.  Great for the period of time when Baby is little and you want him/her nearby.
B0035LLG2W|5|The warmer works perfect. It takes me 5 minutes to warm an 8 oz. bottle. I don't have to stand over the warmer and check it every few seconds to be sure it don't overheat.
B002WDEIVA|5|So far this cover has kept my boppy in great shape. I've only been using it for about  2 weeks, but so far, so good.
B006YPTWHC|5|This bottle saved us!! My 3 month old breastfeed baby was rejecting the bottle right before I was supposed to return to work full time. This is the only bottle she liked for the first few days of training her to take the bottle again. After she was about a month old she would occasionally take any bottle, one day she started rejecting them and coincidentally it was right when I had to go back to work... We were super stressed and so was the baby. With this bottle and a consistent routine of trying to get her to accept the bottle we succeeded after 3 days. It was tough but we had to find a way for her to feel the comfort she felt on the breast with a bottle. We kept doing the same exact things with each feeding so she would get used to it. The first free days she barely ate from the bottle but I stayed strong and only breastfed her in the morning and at night. Her doctor said she would make up the calories and to bring her in if she was still rejecting the bottle in a couple of days to check her weight. We didn't need to do that so it worked out.<br />It's so funny now when we use this bottle to feed her everyone asks us about it.. It's really cute and everyone says it resembles the shape of a boob. :)
B0014J87WE|5|This product was top of the line and very well made.  Glad I made this purchase!
B00769SI5C|5|A like
B003SRJTXQ|3|I bought these to help prevent breakage for my daughter's glass bottles at daycare. I was a little nervous about having glass there, but I hate plastic, and thankfully the daycare is accommodating and allowed glass. When her caretakers are done with the bottles, they set them outside of the room on a shelf above my baby's cubby hole. I went to pick her up the other day, and the caretaker told me that one of the parents had accidentally knocked the bottle over and it broke. The sleeve was on it, so apparently it didn't really protect the glass from breaking. I didn't ask if it shattered everywhere but thankfully nobody was hurt. I thought it was pretty pricey to buy these especially to have the glass brake when it's in them.
B00EFJTI78|5|I love it!
B009OZJQ2U|3|Not what I expected but will do ok for a new born baby
B00CIVBVJS|5|Exactly what it says and fast shipping.
B00172LQEO|1|The picture is VERY misleading. The actual product is really only the size of a large book and you have to empty it out EVERY time you use it. It looks very cheap and I could have spent the $15 on something else for my son.
B000I65DDK|5|I have bought various pacifiers for my daughter, however Avent's are the only pacifiers she takes. As for me, I like the design a lot :) We have already being using such pacifiers for 4 months and it is the second time I buy 6-18m pacifiers for her.
B00AUUEMPO|5|Thank you
B003VNKLHA|2|Gate was not easily installed. Initially thought the gate was broken as it comes with a gap at the door. The gap does eventually close as it is installed and pressure is put on the walls but it had to be manually manipulated in order to get it close enough for the door latch to catch. Product will serve its purpose but I would not buy it again.
B0038IWHR0|5|Exactly what I was looking for to memorialize my best furry friend :)
B00KBGTRAC|5|Brilliant product.
B007F3094C|5|I have used several of the products from this line and couldn't be happier (all fragrance free when there's a choice). They are all very effective and have been kind to my newborn's skin. I have used: foaming dish soap, stain remover, baby wipes, laundry soap, lotion, hiney helper, hand sanitizer, andprotective ointment, foaming body wash, all purpose cleaner.
B001MMW57Q|5|My 16 month old son was never much of a pacifier lover, or a teether lover, but he LOVES the teethifier! He will happily chew on it for hours. In fact I'm going to order another one for back up just in case it ever gets lost.  I would recommend it for anyone who sees their child shoving their fingers or anything within reach in their mouths.  That's when I know to hand my son the teethifier.  I'm really happy that I found this thing!
B00IAJ630E|5|The be quick wristlet is well made with nice gold finish hardware.  The bag can comfortably hold several diapers and a travel container of wipes. I got the queen of the Nile print and love it!
B004N3C2YC|4|Light weight and non slippery. It doesn't fit in my kitchen sink. The legs should have been little more closer
B0056Z3G1O|5|Love this set
B000S9RF4M|5|This toy is a must because it is so bright in colors and it is versatile. I place it on many things...high chair, bouncer, car seat, and swing.
B00AJSIVWW|4|Good for kids about 4-6 years old.
B005C3IT62|2|the crib we have has the bars on the front and back, but not on the sides.  This bumper has instructions for installing it for cribs like that but my husband and i were unable to get it done properly.<br /><br />we ended up not using this bumper (or any other one, for that matter).<br /><br />if i had a \\"regular\\" crib, this would have been cute.  it connects with velcro and has a very cute design on it.  one additional gripe is that the design is only on one side so when it's set up, the front side of the crib has teh design facing the outside (so a person walking towards the crib would see it but the baby would not).
B004G1JXR0|5|At first I had a feeling that I would end up regretting this purchase and that I was going overboard as a first time mom purchasing things that I don't need. However, the seat shade ended up being very useful. I love that it shades my son not only from the sun, but also insects. It was also a lifesaver the other day when it was pouring raining outside; not a drop of rain fell into his carrier thanks to this product.
B000FT7NU6|5|This crib is wonderful! Our son is 4 weeks old now and this crib has helped many a sleepless night. It is small enough to pull right up next our bed so he is close by. We have the wheels off right now and it is easy to rock the crib with just a toe to lull him back to sleep when he stirs at night or to get him back to sleep after a middle of the night feed. It is even light enough to move on carpet with the wheels off. My husband and I are so happy with this purchase.
B006QSDLMY|5|This is the second seat I have bought from this brand. It works perfectly for a child who becomes too big for their carseat. It's a great price, they're easy to switch from car to car, and they come in several cool colors.
B003ODZPI2|5|Helped a lot after delivery. Now at 3 months my baby is too big for thus pillow
B002DYIF1C|5|It is so cute.  The way it moves in the tub is very attracting and entertaining to the child.  I enjoy watching it.  Children really enjoy it.
B00BMTKPZS|3|A lot shorter than I expected but I am going to find some trim to try to make it work. They look nice though
B00A0ID90A|4|Price was right and needed this for when toddler grandsons visited. More grandchildren coming along to use in future too. Perfect for our needs and good quality.
B000CSBOBO|5|This seat has an adjustment to fit any toilet securely.  You definitely do not want a seat that slides easily or makes the child feel insecure while atop the toilet.  It just seems to be the right size to fit any size toddler as well.  My friends children use it too when they come over.  Great buy!
B00913D2BQ|4|I love this crib sheet. It is very soft. Its thick and stretchy. I love the color and was happy to see that the pink color was lighter than in the picture. The pink in the picture looks a bit dark (almost purple) but maybe that's just my eyes.
B002XVRKHK|4|These towels are thin but perfect for cleaning up your little one while feeding. Bath time is good too, but it is real thin and does not hold the soap in so well. But they workout just fine.
B00005V6C8|1|Get the Diaper Genie Elite II, the one with a foot pedal.  This one is gross.  After you push down the pedal, there's a piece of white plastic that you have to push down to put the diaper in = unsanitary over time.  This system also stinks.
B004J8HP70|4|Although 2 of these sound very similar, they are still very fun.  I love that they are waterproof and can go in the tub.  Perfect size for little hands.
B004C053AQ|5|For babies looking to take a bottle and still being breastfed, this is the bottle! The whole thing is squishy and soft and my son who was being being very picky, took this one immediately. It does come out a little fast but my little guy got the hang of it.  We tried avent, Adiri, kiinde, and playtex.
B006ZSYGOW|5|I love this product. It's the perfect weight and is big enough to use as a swaddle blanket. Baby also loves holding it in his hands which seems to soothe him. If you're preparing for a baby, I created a comprehensive list of must have baby registry items for the first three months. Just search for \\"All Moms Are Perfect\\" in google. It's in the preparing for baby section.
B0001CTZ8K|5|Pretty straightforward. Definitely important to replace these frequently. If you're losing suction, try replacing the membranes before you lose your mind. Also, good idea to have spares because these things love to run away while washing.
B00150JR58|5|This item is probably fine, but I had it mixed up with another item that I bought.... and that other item is the one I wanted to review.  I did go ahead and publish a very positive review on the item that I actually bought, I just haven't figured out yet how to delete this review on this item!
B007E2E706|5|My daughter has two in cloth diapers and she loves it.. does what it is supposed to do. Takes out the smell, but microfiber is tough to remove from. Cotton and all others, this does a great job.
B009UQFS0W|1|cheaper at walmart but worth the purchase just next time ill shop around cause it was only 7 dollars at walmart
B00VJL0DG0|5|Very useful and it gives my husband piece of mind.
B004YGL65E|4|My son just had a baby girl yesterday. They haven't had a chance yet to use it. The crib seems like it made really nice , the drawers are much bigger than I thought they would be,and it's beautiful. Only time will tell how it holds up.
B00NCDQ4NY|5|Even I enjoyed playing with these, my granddaughter and I have loads of fun, item is as described and super fast shipping is nice too  we peeled them and put them on her wall for about 3 hours until we decided to let them stick where she wanted them, so very well made sturdy and worth it
B00H8MSKAU|3|Well I love the overall design of this carseat. Having 8 different adjustments for head and shoulder strap height is a great feature so it grows with our son.<br /><br />My main complaint with this product (I bought two, one for my wife's car and one for mine to keep our 3 year old son rear facing for a few more months) is how hard it is to tighten when the carseat is actually installed and has our son in it. Set to the correct recline position and correctly installed in both of our cars places the tightening strap almost covered by the back seat. This makes it so you have to pull almost straight up on the strap to tighten the harness which actually presses against the release lever to release the tension on the straps. I think that once our son turns to the forward facing position, the tightening will be much easier because we will be able to pull straight out and not have the strap bind or hit anything.<br /><br />Great, safe product that just needs a few tweaks. The carseat is hard to tighten, not impossible. just inconvenient.
B00KWP650C|5|I've never actually owned these in the past but I've always seen them at the store and some of them seemed a little heavy. These NeverMess Baby Bibs though, are very light weight so it will not strain your child's neck or anything. I just love this invention for babies, especially since it's very easy to clean and travel-friendly. You won't worry about having about washing a pile of bibs in the washing machine considering this only takes seconds to wash in the sink and rinse off. Another thing that I love about this bib is the adjustment band for the neck. It's not hard to put on my baby at all and I like that it has many adjustments and it will continue to fit her as long as she needs it. I really recommend this product for new time mommies out there and it's a great gift for baby showers as well.
B00AHPZY68|5|Just installed this car seat in my car (2012 Honda Civic) yesterday.  It fits very well for being a small car.  It was very easy to install also.  Seat feels comfortable too.  My son seems to like it.
B0006BAJHM|4|They work, but I found them to be a little bit too wide for the First Years milk storage organizer.  I like the Lansinoh bags a lot better.
B000FI0HUU|3|It's okay but good luck using it on a squirming, unhappy baby.
B00MRZIGVG|5|My 17 month old mastered this cup in a day. It does not leak one drop which is nice. I tried to drink water out of it myself and does require you to give a good suck. But it isnt any harder than her sippy cups she has. She really enjoys carrying it around and drinking from it. Overall I would reccomend if you want to introduce cups to your toddler. I think its a great start.
B00C32DNU2|5|Beaba Babycook Rice Cooker - Gipsy for Babycook Pro/Pro2x<br /><br />i like it,and use it to cook rice to my baby
B00027P7S6|5|My little cousin got this chick (it's her third of Barbie) she calls them Barbie ,Barbara ,and Bridgette.The only thing I noticed that wasn't the best was the Levi's have some sort of filmy something on 'em.The other clothes are cute but i'm not especialy fond of the black bustier (it's always falling down) <br />But unlike other models of barbie the hair is beautifully smoothe.
B006SFUDT4|5|Does a great job!
B00KDCCOZ4|5|update I got everything taken care of amazon came through as always and I give this company 5 stars because they tried and im sorry it didn't work out product though I didn't see but the quality of this peg perego company is outstanding
B005C08PMS|4|This is perfect for my little one.  It fits most carts and the ones it doesn't fit it fits well enough it's doing the job.  I know some people talk about it not being &#34;fluffy&#34; enough or &#34;thick&#34; enough but my little one is not in a cart for hours!  It does its job and I'm able to put a few toys by him or even a sippy cup by him without worrying if it is going to fall out.  I also love this because where I live we have cold weather and there are times he gets a cold cart.  This helps keep his little body warm and not having to put him on a freezing seat.  Of course it is also doing the job of keeping germs at bay and it also helps when he tries putting the handle bar in mouth the cover is in the way and helps prevent that.
B000U5FOT2|5|i love this gate. it is just high enough for me to climb over it if i have to and i'm only 5ft 1in. but it is tall enough to keep my 10 month old from being able to get out. the gate is easy to open and close for me but impossible for my son. i have both ends attached to the wall and it is very sturdy. i don't think there is enough room with just one set for my son to be mobile in since he just started walking so i ordered another one. i'm sooo excited about getting it. shipping was quick and assembly was easy. you just pull it out of the box and open it up. the only think you have to do is connect the ends either to a wall or to each other. wonderful product
B00EOML96O|1|This was great for the first few washes and then it ripped.  I was so disappointed with both the bottle brush and the nipple brush!  NOT WORTH THE MONEY!  We got a silicone brush and it work a lot better
B0032UXG3I|4|This little bib made for fun photos and it is well enough made to be used over and over, too.
B000ZYM8SS|5|good
B001D7DYS4|5|This sleep sak is just what we needed.  The little one was waking up if she got chilly.  I was not using a blanket for safety reasons.  Now she is nice and cozy and I don't have to put her in bed with me!
B008K4GMOG|5|Cute. Cheap.
B00DNBA82S|5|I am so pleased with this monitor! Sound and picture are great and I think it was worth every penny.
B00171WXII|5|It seems to cause a lot less discomfort in my baby so thats a plus.! It works really well in getting that nasty snot thats hiding deep in the nose.
B006QH43Y0|5|Let me start by saying that I have gone through several prams recently, trying to find one that meets all my requirements, including - suitable for long walks outside and on all different terrains, light/compact and easy to fold and is comfortable for my little 13 weeks old daughter. I originally bought the regular city mini, but soon realised that it didn't do that great on terrain such as gravel and long grass etc. Living near the beach I encounter many sidewalks and trails that aren't the smoothest of surfaces. I decided that the GT would be perfect to meet these needs and was worth the extra $100 for those forever air tires.<br />Here are the improvements over the regular Mini that are, in my opinion, very much worth the extra $$.<br />- more plush and padded seat<br />- higher weight capacity of 60 pounds<br />- hand break<br />- adjustable handle<br />and of course the GT, forever air tires!!<br /><br />Other positive aspects of this stroller include:<br />- the HUGE canopy with the two peekaboo windows<br />- the very easy recline mechanism, and even though it is a strap system, the button is super easy to squeeze and use. I owned a Bumbleride Indie earlier this year, and although I loved all the other features, the recline button was SUPER hard to press and stuck ALL the time - which eventually drove me crazy enough that I sold the stroller!<br />~ also the flat recline is awesome and my daughter sleeps ALL the time in there. With the canopy all the way extended it is basically like her own little cocoon in there :)<br />- the mesh opening at the back of the seat is great for hot days and air flow<br />- the one step folding system is fantastic and super easy. Simply pull up on the middle strap in the seat and WAHLA! the stroller is folded in half, very compact and not too heavy at all (21 pounds).<br />- the harness is very easy to use and i like how it is 5 points, so I can choose when I want to use the shoulder straps or simply the side straps.<br /><br />and now about the basket -- people have complained in the past that it is difficult to access, and yes it is from the BACK if the seat is fully reclined. I access it from the sides and find it VERY EASY to get things in and out and honestly you can fit SOOO much in there. Recently I had a fairly large diaper bag, plus several jackets in there and shoes from my kids playing at the beach and it all fit very nicely.<br /><br />The only CON I may have with the GT:<br />- in order to fold the stroller you basically can't leave a stroller liner in there that isn't secured in place. I have to take out my liner each time, but don't find it that big of a deal, cause I just fold it up and put in on the side of the boot, or could probably just stick it in the bottom of the pram and fold it in there.<br />- also, being a three wheel stroller, some people may find that it doesn't feel that sturdy going up and down curbs etc, but it just takes a bit of getting used to.<br /><br />OVERALL - the GT pushes like a dream and really is a one handed stroller if needed. It rides smoothly over all sorts of surfaces and the GT wheels really do make a huge difference. OK, so it doesn't offer parent facing, which is why we also have a Baby Jogger Versa for shopping trips etc -- however, once our daughter is passed that stage in a few month, I can see myself using the GT more as it is much lighter. I love how the weight capacity is so high and at times my solid built 3 years old can hop in for a ride. I can see us having this stroller for many years to come.<br /><br />P.S. If you are after a parent tray that goes well with the Baby Jogger prams, the Britax Stroller Organizer is awesome! We use it on the Versa and GT and is sturdy, and has the perfect compartments :)<br />check it out - [[ASIN:B007CTPWXW Britax USA S866100 Stroller Organizer]]>and now about the basket -- people have complained in the past that it is difficult to access, and yes it is from the BACK if the seat is fully reclined.

B00MKH2X4C|5|This is the second one I've purchased to have as a back-up. My son won't go to sleep without it!
B005ULUZIQ|5|We began using these swaddles when my daughter was days old because she preferred to have her hands by her face. It's so much easier than swaddling with a blanket or Velcro model. It's still very cozy and gets the job done. We have several in our home.
B002L8250W|5|it is very comfortable and I like it very very much..  it was my pretty doughtars lovely cloth...  very sweet blancket
B002EVOXME|4|Let me start off by saying I have 7 dogs.  All sizes from 15 pounds to 112 pounds.  All love the sofa.  So much, that I'm replacing it.  lol  I'm getting a smaller sofa, so decided to get something just for them.  So far only my 18 pound Westie likes it, though my 71 pound German Shepherd sits on it too,  but she looks at me as if to say \\"this isn't big enough\\".  She does fit...but she looks a bit ridiculous.  Once their old sofa goes, I expect his will be a popular item.<br />It's well made.  Supposed to hold 80 pounds...I can't imagine a child over age 3 using it -- it'd be too small for them.  Not that it couldn't hold them, but it would look strange as it's not that big. Sort of like the \\"giant baby\\" in the photo.  Strange looking.<br />It also comes with 2 little black pillows.  My two little dogs could easier nap on it together...the medium sized dogs could nap as well.  Hopefully, they'll use it.  It sure is cute though.  Glad I bought it:}
B002TMSXF6|4|Works as intended.  It looks a bit ugly, but block out sun...
B00H8MSK1Y|5|We love this carseat
B00TOWTXJE|5|REALLY CUTE. PERFECT SIZE TO USE IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS. PLAN ON USING ON BRIDE AND GROOMS TABLE.CANT WAIT UNTIL WEDDING IN AUGUST 2015 💕😄😄😄
B00C6AAGKG|1|Was not satisfied. Stated they were 0-3 months and they were 0-6 months.
B00M1W92B8|5|These are great shades!  I've had other kinds that did not hold up, fell down, broke, would no longer retract etc but so far am thrilled with these.  So easy to put up and keep up.  Have had them up for about 2 weeks now and they have not come off once...even with me accidentally rolling down the window a bit!  I only wish that they were a bit darker than they are.  The protection is very good but my lil one would prob prefer a blacked out window when it comes to sun in the car.  Overall excellent product and wonderful service ;)
B004UAD0RQ|5|Bought it as a gift for a friend, a mom of two new infant twin boys.  She's delighted with it in all respects, and it has great range and versatility.
B004TUE8IC|5|Great product.  Cups last a long time and lids are easy for my 1 year old to use.  Not a lot of spillage when tipped either
B002J4U8SO|4|This is about 3 inches wide and 4 inches long, it is tiny. Works well and small hands an work the small vehicles<br />I would buy it again.
B0014A0W9E|4|This is a nice fitted sheet for a crib mattress.  The fabric is really cute and it washes really nicely too.
B001QVMH0S|4|I really like this system as it has helped me to pump milk ahead of time for going back to work. Being able to keep the milk longer is a huge plus. The one drawback is that due to the vacuum \\"dimple\\" you can't stack them in the freezer or the cupboard.  Also, get the Born Free Pump adapter and you can pump straight into them!   Dex baby has great customer service and told me the above as well as they sold me the pieces to be able to use my storage system as baby bottles.  Amazon has the best prices on this system too.
B000GUZC2A|5|So cute. I love it.
B001BMWABI|2|After my son started eating solid food, my husband and I purchased a diaper genie to dispose of his diapers, hoping it would contain the smell enough to go to the outside trash can once per day.  I thought that the diaper genie twisted each diaper in a separate segment of the bag so the smell would be contained.  It doesn't.  Instead, all it does is create a little pocket at the top of the trash bag to deposit a dirty diaper, which then releases to drop the diaper to the bottom of the bag when the lid closes.  Smells escape from the bag because it is never fully sealed.  And the plastic lid is not sealed to retain smell either.  It probably helps contain smell a little, but not enough to drop in a soiled diaper to dispose of it later.  The smell was intolerable even on the first day's use.  The only good thing about this is that it is pretty easy to remove the bag and no need to remind the person emptying the can to replace the bag.  To anyone who is thinking of purchasing one of these, I would recommend a small metal trash can with a foot lever for the lid.  We have a SimpleHuman kitchen trash can and it retains smells far better than the diaper genie.  The trash bags are much cheaper also.
B00D5OU6DE|3|The stickers are really cute but the packaging caused bad creases in every sticker that will not come out and shows on the wall.
B00BLY1M6K|5|Ideal item, delivered on time
B004ECJWK4|5|The Door Monkey is awesome!  I was skeptical at first since it seemed like a flimsy piece of plastic (which is still is), but it actually works rather well.  I would say that flipping it around is useful, but you have to be careful the door doesn't slam into the wall which will break the Door Monkey.  Other than that, it does what it's made to do, and does it well.
B0006FHFYS|5|The aquarium cradle swing was the best thing that I got for my daughter. She wasn't able to sleep in her crib, but slept all night in her swing from the night we got home ( she was 2 days old) She now is close to the weight limit and the motor in the swing no loger works, and I'm finding it hard to spend another  $100 for another swing. I did love the swing, and so did my daughter. She still wants to be in the swing, only now I have to swing her.
B001OC5UMQ|5|The only complaint I have is that the picture kind of implies that you can operate it with one hand, and you really can't.  Not easily, anyway.  The women in the picture would have to put down the baby.<br /><br />But I just got it for my dogs, so it's no big deal.<br /><br />Update 8/14/14: I stand corrected; you CAN open it with one hand.  I've gotten the hang of it. It does help to have big hands, though.
B00F55P1WW|4|This is the best diaper pail! Holds so many diapers and I like that it's talk. Bought and tried the diaper champ pail first and it was terrible. It killed my back to bend over 15 times a day to throw away a diaper and the trash bag needed to be changed once a day - maybe could stretch it to two days.<br />The Diaper Dekor I can empty every 3-4 days and I just discovered that you don't have to use their refills. A regular trash bag works just fine! Score!
B00DOGV010|5|These are a fantastic, fantastic deal when it comes to Pocket Diapers. I love them and have had no issues with them. I would suggest that you buy some Rock the Green Cloth diaper detergent and do a good soaking prior to use to help maximize absorbency, but I would say the same for any other brand Cloth Diaper.<br /><br />Bottom line...these diapers cost $9 a piece and I would say that they are just as good (or extremely close) as any $20 pocket diaper...and you get TWO microfiber inserts with each Pocket Diaper and they are great inserts.<br /><br />We have 24 of these and only 4 $20ish pocket diapers.
B00BU7Q5TW|2|Not a fan of this one and honestly a 2 stars is being generous. Mostly being kind because I do love Taggies toys.  This seat sits too deep and causes the child to sit up at too much of a slant.  I also don't  care for the stiffness of the bouncer,  I really prefer a bouncer than rocks or bounces manually and this one used batteries and just has a little bit of a bounce/rock in it.  I have owned several bouncers rockers over the years while raising my own children and a home-day-care and this one is being used for my grandchild and I am NOT impressed.  Sorry Taggies.    UPDATE::  Grandson is know 4 months old and I decided to try to use this a little more since it was here and I hate that I was wasting it when it was a gift.  Know that he is bigger, he can sit and play in it with toys hanging on the bar over head, AFter about 3 weeks of use the part that holds the toy bar to the chair and rotates the toy bar broke off.  It is official.  This bouncer chair is a JUNK!!!   Taggies needs to redesign it with their customers in mind this time or just stick to their little blankets and books which are wonderful.
B000BV4T9Q|4|I bought this monitor for my parents cabin. I knew I would be farther away from my three year old when he wakes up from his naps. I can now walkie talkie back to him and let him know I am on the way. He can then talk back freely and I can respond. I used it at home before I brought it up to the cabin full time and was able to FINISH my shower. He woke up and I walkied back, \\"I'm in the shower. You can get up and play with your toys and I will be right there\\". I am going to buy another one for home.    I didn't give it a 5 star because I am maxing out the range. I wish it went a little further.
B0042D69W4|5|I got this set for my 10 month old grandson.  My daughter in law thought it was cute and he seemed to like it a lot!  It is something different and dad likes to build things.
B00B93RYSS|5|This will stay cold for about 12 hours in the middle of the summer in my backpack or about 6 if left in a hot car... VERY impressed!!  Plus I love that it folds up flat to take up less space in the freezer.  And it's adorable.
B001BTS0YW|5|this was and still remains one of our granddaughter's most fun toys. It &#34;grows&#34; with her. I have since purchased this as a gift for several babies and will do so again.
B004YWKWJO|5|love!! 5 count was not necessary for one baby...we keep using one and one extra to take in diaper bag...other three just hanging out in a drawer
B000056JHP|5|I have purchased the Mighty-Tite Car Seat Belt Tightener last year and it was the BEST purchase I made for my son!  I could never quite get the car seat as secure as I wanted.  I purchased the Mighty-Tite and I cannot believe that my son's seat does not even budge!  It is extremely easy to install and I also purchased one for my husband's truck.  You can put your mind at ease when you KNOW your child is safe!  I highly recommend this to everyone.  In fact, I now buy this as a gift for all of my friends having babies!
B00J957K3M|5|Super cure and warm, true to size. Would buy again.
B000W8RRXI|5|My daughter loves it. She gets upset when I take it off in the morning. It keeps her warm through the night and is spacious enough to allow her to kick, which is her favorite pass time activity. I recommend the Halo Sleepsack be used from birth to 1 year. It alleviates the need to constantly worry whether or not your child is breathing, which helps us new mommies get our much needed sleep.
B00067MVQ8|1|This wipes warmer was to replace the one that got broken in our move. We use cloth wipes it has burned a few, smells moldy no matter what I have done to clean it (never happened with any of our other wipes warmers) won't stay closed. It actually got so hot it melted the 'moisture dispenser' and melted/burned the little foamish piece in it. Then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today to buy a new different one and leaked water all over the changing table. GET a different warmer this one is awful.
B00HMAJM4Q|5|We have the graco click connect car seat and use this adapter with the Baby Jogger summit x3. It is incredibly convenient to be able to click that sucker in and go. I just got back from a week long trip visiting family with my 2-month old, and there was a lot of getting in and out of cars, going through airport security, etc. The click adapter is the way to go. I'm so glad we didn't have to hassle with a universal bar with ties and straps and whatnot.
B00BQX2CP6|5|Just as pictured. Daughter loves it
B00952ALT4|4|They are wonderful and the clips are strong, the only thing wrong with them is that there was a sharp melted edge to the elastic where it was sewn together so I had to modify that a little to get rid of the sharp edge.
B00HR8UE54|4|Very cute and works well.
B00O10L87O|5|These teething rings were given to me as a gift as I though Id be find with just the cheap old ones but wow was I wrong. Once I got these and gave them to my son he was not only soothed by them for his teething but he also was quite entertained by their cool, the texture, shape and size. They are easy to wash which make me as a mother who needs everything to be clean perfect. I have also found that I can use a clip to hook them onto things so that my son can entertain himself or chew on them without me worrying about what he has in his mouth.
B00295MQLU|4|Makes double-pumping much easier! Doesn't quite line up with my breasts but pretty close with the included extension zip-in. A must if you are pumping, IMHO.
B0038JE650|4|It's cute and I like that it's the (approximate) shape and color of a water drop. When I first tried it out I was skeptical because it didn't seem to form a tight seal over the drain, but it worked like a charm and I ended up staying in the bath for an inadvisably long time. Hooray!
B00D4LFDX6|5|Love the back pack. There is a lot of space and pockets for EVERYTHING!
B00B1Z6PUW|1|Unless you click the link for “more information,” the description leads you to believe that the product can be used for a teething infant.  This is not the case.  The product was delivered with a warning that it is not recommended for children under three and is a choking hazard.  What child at three years old needs teething beads??  I’m returning the product.
B00IR4F4JI|4|Pain in the butt if having to move between older cars. Its heavy. My daughters head typically falls forward if she falls asleep and its hard to see around when backing up but good car seat over all
B006JINB1M|5|I am a nanny for twin toddler boys. I bought my first brand new car and wasn't thrilled about the likelihood of dirty shoes on the back of my seats. The mats are great. They have a thickness to them so they won't tear and they appear very well made. They fit the seats of my VW Golf perfectly. I have been using them for over a month and I imagine they will hold up for years.
B007YCQ1SC|5|I give this 5 stars. It's exactly as the picture shows. Works like a charm, and it very easy to clean.
B00DHYMHES|5|Great
B00EEJOV3A|4|If you have the small 6 oz zoli bottle, you need to cut the straw shorter. In general it's okay
B007OOW7RO|5|This is a beautiful high quality stroller/pram.  It is a solid well-made stroller perfect for outdoor use and well suited for the city sidewalks.<br />I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality pram.
B003KMWATY|5|Present, she loves it !!!!
B00DJOTJPG|5|Handy for attaching to the stroller or grocery cart or bike. I love this handy bag to carry the essentials.
B000BV9Q80|5|Two years later and it is still in new condition and my son still loves it and sleeps through the night.
B0064Y3VK2|4|I ordered this 2 weeks after delivering my baby, as I have a 21 month old at home as well and we go for walks daily. I feel as though there are things that could be fixed on this stroller, but all in all it works great for us.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Assembly was pretty straight forward<br />-Colors work perfectly with our Graco infant car seat.<br />-Canopies are moveable (back isn't attached to the stroller)<br />-Speakers are great for listening to music<br />-Easy to push/not too awkward<br />-Fits through all the doors I've tried going through<br />-Folds up easily<br />-Mesh panels on back of seats for airflow<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Front wheel wobbles when unlocked (possibly because baby and car seat don't weigh enough to keep it from doing that).<br /><br />-Seats have to be reclined by undoing the strap (looks like the strap that hooks the child in the seat) which makes it hard to lay down a toddler quickly if they happen to fall asleep during walk.<br /><br />-Wish the canopies were slightly bigger.<br /><br />Overall, it works for what we need it for, I will update once we've had it longer!
B00SG8SMSK|5|These stickers have cute little patterns for each month. The sticker is made of stifter paper so it doesn't bend; however the adhesive isn't very sticky.  Overall, these are great for the price and serve its purpose for taking pictures.
B003Y3BGVW|5|Wonderful product!!!
B000JUXK1W|5|This is a very comfy changing pad for my son to lay on. The only thing that I do not care for is the positioning of the straps.
B0016L0MMS|4|I wish the locking mechanism was different. Its a little tough to get it to lock properly while your kid is squirming around and is ready to let loose. Otherwise, its great.
B008KFISUG|5|Good quality item . and my son like it very much.  It is very  safe for my baby too. Good
B004ECJWK4|5|Awesome product. Works great, easy to install and very strong. Definately would recommend this product to anyone with little kids.
B008337RMA|5|have used for both my daughters they are affordable and great. easy on and off with the shoulder snaps and big zipper and light weight but cozy.
B004B7790M|5|This is a hard part to find by itself as a replacement, is exactly what I needed.
B00OR51I3W|5|With my first child nursing was literally painful and so when I found out I was pregnant I knew I had to find something to help soothe.  My baby is not due until February so I can tell you how it feels after nursing but I love using them for the soreness I get from pregnancy.  I've tried it both hot and cold and I'm excited because they seem like they are really going to help soothe me this go round.  Wish I had bought this with my first child!
B000O8UGUM|5|I use these to protect my diapers from getting stained and I love them
B000PEHKXG|4|We bought this booster for our 3 year old daughter based on information in the Toddler Bargains book.  I really like how easy it is to install and adjust, but am disappointed in the headrest.      One of the points I was excited about with this seat was that it had side parts for a head rest when my daughter fell asleep in the car.  However, in real-life I've found that they don't work.  She starts off leaning on them as she doses off, but once she is asleep, her head lolls forward and rests on her chest and/or shoulder.  I think they are not big enough or in a bad position.  We have to recline her whole seat to almost a 45 degree angle to get her head to stay back and rest on the head rest.    Also, the black \\"cushion\\" that goes behind the head is a tiny cushion that just attaches to itself through the strap with Velcro.  It is easy to lose, easy to forget to install, and attracts hair.  This could've been designed much better.    Overall a good seat - but don't buy it over another booster just for the headrest option.
B00AMU4HPW|2|This bead spread was sent back.  It seems small and cheap and I don't think it would last a washing. Came rolled up like a cheap kids sleeping bag. That is how the material looked.
B002ONUZMY|5|It's a wonderful item for a nice price. I'm happy I ordered it .
B00ADHRZEY|3|i like it but its very complicated to install.
B00007M4JT|5|I bought this item in Canada and now that I see how cheap it is in the States, I so wish I had found it before my travels. I payed over $100 in Canada for it which roughy translates to about $75 American these days. I bought it because I needed something light for the car seat between flights. Now I keep it in the car and use it for every shopping trip. I love how small it is and maneuvarable, and how light it is. I also can position my evenflow car seat a little more horizontally when she sleeps by putting it between the bars instead of on it. The only problem I have with it is the almost completely useless basket. The opening doesn't help at all, its almost impossible to put anything in there except for very narrow or small items. Certainly not a diaper bag.  I have a big stroller which I keep in the garage and use it for walks around the neighbourhood. So the frame, for the price, is really worth getting, if you have a heavy stroller.
B001C51TIE|1|The car seat was soaked. We had to take all the covers and wash them. This thing doesn't hold any liquid at all.<br />Don't waste your money on this.
B0013O9RX8|5|I have tried a bunch of different pumps. This is my fourth baby and prior to this baby I usually went with the Avent ISIS manual pump and it worked great for what it is. Then with my third child I invested in a Pump in Style and actually didn't like it as much as the ISIS. I felt like I could get more milk in a shorter amount of time. Although, to do that I had to use a lot of pressure on the ISIS which made my nipples hurt. This go round I start out with the new version of the Avent ISIS and maybe I'm just getting older now or something but I didn't like that it hurt so much and I also didn't like that after 10 minutes of pumping one breast I would have to pump the other for another 10 minutes. So I talked my husband into letting me go back to Medela. Well, if you're going to spring for a great pump you might as well get the best and THIS IS THE BEST! I love the hands free version and portability of it. I love that it doesn't hurt like heck to pump which means I will probably use this pump alot more!
B009NMO5CK|5|Positives: Super narrow, easy to install, folds up for easy carting through airports or traveling<br />Negatives: Very heavy and in forward-facing position seems to sit more upright than our last carseat, which makes for a grumpy toddler when he wants to sleep.
B004HKIIGC|4|I bought this sippy cup at a local baby boutique. I really love this cup because it is leak proof, I put it in the dishwasher and it still looks brand new and it keeps water colder longer. My only issue with this cup is I bought the one with the extra parts and its pretty annoying when you unscrew the lid, a skinny plastic ring falls out after you have \\"used\\" the sippy for a while...it can leak if this isn't in properly and there is another part for the mouth opening that comes out. They give you a straw and a stopper for when you travel which is nice, but it seems like a lot of parts for just a sippy cup. Overall I am happy with this cup but I wouldn't buy another one. I do however have the Think Baby sippy and use that more.
B001VER3NQ|4|This blanket is very soft, and nice fabric. Our son has always preferred blankets that have a silkie side, but this blanket is good quality and is warm.
B002RT8O5U|5|I rec'd three boxes of these with some gro baby diaper shells I ordered.  These are truly amazing.  No leaks, better for the environment and very easy to use make this a great product.  Our son has had absolutely no problems with irritation using these diapers.  It makes using cloth diapers on the go a much easier process.
B00L9NR672|5|So far, I am very pleased with this diffuser.<br /><br />- user friendly, as I set up in 2 minutes.<br />- the color changes are nice.<br />- have only used in kitchen, so I cannot attest to how big of a room you should use.<br /><br />Love all the blend options! You can even make one for a snoring partner, or to help keep the family immune boosted during those seasons.
B00H0DH2NS|5|Our baby didn't take any bottle other than this one. The nipple works well for babies who are used to nursing.
B00092A7E8|5|good price, good product and saved me a drive to go buy these items seperately.<br /><br /> my sister is having her second baby and we gave her back the breast pump which she lend us when we had ours, this kit contains all of the parts which can not transfer from one mother/child to another. and then some.<br /><br />good value.
B000G7NK40|5|This should come standard with pack n plays.  I feel awful that I didn't have it for my son for the first 1 1/2 year of his life.  It makes sleeping in his graco pack n play much more comfortable.  It's a must buy if you travel (by car)!  The only downfall is the size.  It doesn't fold up.
B004V3CRUS|2|Although you get alot of stickers for your money (they are a bit repetitive) they don't stick well. I am comparing this brand new product to my 2 year olds Cocalo (Babies R Us) brand, we moved from DFW to Houston, and the Cocalo stickers survived being removed, cold/heat of storage unit, and being put up again in our new house here. Not one has tried to peel off. However the JoJo stickers were coming off within the same day. The walls in each room are the same texture, and we cleaned the walls etc, but I could tell this product was inferior. Too bad
B004LE8T9U|5|Lots of room to add details from the beginning of pregnancy through age 5. Room for some pictures and places to add some scrapbook embellishments if you like.
B000B90G8G|4|The chair is cool looking, easy to manipulate with one hand (while holding the baby in the other arm) and comfortable for the baby.  My only issue is that it is indeed difficult to clean.  If someone can tell me how to remove all of the straps from the chair for cleaning, then it would be the perfect chair.  Some of the straps are removeable for cleaning but some are not.  I had to set a big bowl full of soapy water on the chair to soak the straps overnight as they were looking pretty grimy.  There really should be an easier way.
B00511J6LW|5|The size, pattern, price, and design of this bag is perfect for me.  Many pockets for keeping organized; even distribution so it's not heavy on the shoulder; easy to wipe material clean.  I have carried a dozen diaper bags over the past 8 years while raising 3 little ones and this is my favorite one.
B007XL89MA|5|I love these bottles. I used this for my first child and now I'm using this for my second child. Not too many pieces to clean and they're easy to clean without the need for special tools.
B00KDKKD1I|5|Perfect pillow!!! Love the size, durability, stitching. Love, love it!!! 3yo adores this.
B0051POK6Y|5|My son loved his. Soft, comforting and goes right in the washer and dryer. Perfect!
B00KFJLG1S|4|cute idea
B0018Z8CN8|5|This tub is great because:<br />-it fit in my sink<br />-it was stable on my mother's bathroom counter<br />-I forgot about the \\"legs\\" and use it in my tub now, with no stability issues<br />-it is easy to clean<br />-it worked well for my baby with the width, height, depth, and cushion<br />-it is still perfect for my large 18 month old so I don't have to fill an entire tub<br />-it's cute<br />-the orange fish is also easy to clean (no mold like in the squirter toys)<br />-the orange fish is strangely fun for my child<br /><br />All of my friends got the summer infant one with the sling--the sling seems hard to clean and not easy to use. I have a hand-me-down of that one without the sling; it doesn't seem to fit my toddler well. The top-rated review pretty much says it all!
B00ED1Y9UY|4|Love the handy pouch for when we go on outings.
B001ABH1QY|5|Got this seat for my nephew. He is on the heavier side at 22lbs for a 9 month old. However, he fit in the seat comfortably and it kept him strapped down. It is perfect for keeping him still and to assist him with sitting upright. The item arrived well packaged although a few days late due to a holiday. This can also be used comfortably for my own son when he gets a little older. It was a great buy & would suggest to everyone looking for this type of product.
B004GCJMLG|5|My brother has these, and we decided to try them out. Best Baby Locks Ever! If you are cooking and will be using a drawer or cabinet a lot, then you can turn off the lock. Once your child wakes up then turn the lock back on.<br /><br />The install instructions were not helpful. It looks like Safety 1st did try to do everything they could to help with installing but with my drawers the instructions did not help. The first Drawer took quite awhile but the all the others were a walk in the park.<br /><br />Take your time installing this in a corner kitchen cabinet. I am talking about a cabinet door that has the extra set of hinges in the middle of the door to be able to close off a corner. This cabinet usually has a Lazy Susan in it.  Think through it and pick your location carefully.<br /><br />Excellent Product and I have since bought more! Highly recommended!
B0047LUDFK|1|I read a few reviews for the LatchOn before purchasing and was quite excited to receive it. I love the idea of a simple accessory that would let me use the blanket of my choice as a nursing cover, rather than carrying yet another thing in my diaper bag. I opened it as soon as I got it and decided to try it out on a muslin blanket. I pinched the clip to open and immediately the decorative flower element fell off revealing a basic metal clip. Overall this is quite disappointing - cheap fabric, messy stitching (there are loose threads in no less than six places around this ~18\\" oblong piece of fabric.<br /><br />I will use it the next time I nurse in public to review actual function. However, even if it does work I'll be hard pressed to feel that it's worth the $15+ I spent on it (and that was a marked down price!)
B0046RDG8Q|5|This chair is as cute as it looks in the picture. My nephew loves movie nights and I thought if would be nice for him to have his own seat in the house. This chair is very comfortable (not too stiff), has a nice high back for a new sitter, and is very well crafted. I only wish the feet to the chair were wood and not plastic, but I don't even think I am going to put them on the chair; they aren't really necessary.
B0055LV3XW|4|Does the job we wanted it to do and for a good price.
B00JFVHEPO|5|Good quality, nice bright color, fits the Stokke oval crib mattress well. It's a little pricey, but it is about the same price as the Stokke brand sheet and comes in many more colors.
B00AN8S07Y|5|its the bath tub my son wanted for his son,they love it works great.Will get one for the next grandchild
B005FNRRE4|1|Would not ever spend 14.07 for one case... not a good deal.. they were 1.47 in the stores. Bad deal. I got my money back.
B007NG5UF4|3|This is the second one of these I've purchased.  It works well and is reasonably priced, but the first one lost its display and the power cord broke within a year and a half.
B0021435SC|3|I ordered these and was in for a BIG surprise.  I didn't realize that they were size L/XL until I opened the box.  Unless you have very large breast, you won't want this product.  I use the Ameda standard size (25 mm) and the Medium size (28.5 mm) works too.  If you have size A-B breasts either of the standard or medium sizes will work.  If your breasts are larger, than perhaps this is the product for you.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that the listing should have the size in the title.
B000O7SR7M|2|I thought this sheet would be fine for my pack n play.  I was pretty disappointed when I received this sheet- it is SO thin.  I bought a different one right away and this one is basically shoved in the back of my closet as a spare in case of emergencies.  I would spend a few extra bucks and get a different one!
B003TPNV1S|4|The bassinet is great. We wheel it around the house as needed with our newborn. The storage compartments are very handy for all the odds and ends baby needs. The only complaint I have so far is that the sheet that comes with the bassinet pills when you wash it. I have to run a lint roller over the sheet multiple times to ensure all those little cotton balls don't get stuck to baby. I am looking to order replacement sheets since the one that comes with it does not handle washing well, even when you line dry it.<br /><br />The only reason it does not get five stars from me is the sheet. Other than that I have no complaints.
B004CL9YHS|5|Looks good and easy to install.  I was worried installing a gate would look &#34;junky&#34;, it does not.  i actually painted the reddish wood part black so the gate is all one color and less obtrusive.
B00E8NGRN4|4|Some false alarms, but I'd  rather have the error be on the more careful side, so no complaints there. Wish maybe the alarm were a bit louder if it were an emergency. Would buy again.
B0043D28AU|5|my baby very like it
B001D7KNYW|5|These are great and inexpensive, so perfect to keep in the bag and use when &#34;real&#34; kids silverware isn't available.  They hold up for a few uses if I wash them, but also are inexpensive so I don't care if they are left behind and recycled.
B00OJN7L3I|2|The very first time I used it, the bag got a hole in it.  I plan to return this item back to the seller for a refund.
B002C30S96|5|We LOVE this backpack.  I use it for my toddler instead of a diaper bag, and it is just so cute.  Just the right size and he loves to give it hugs. :)
B00BLY1L7A|5|its good quality this will bethe closest thing you can get to a mattress for a mini crib
B000YHC6ZQ|4|My 15-month-old son loves to throw his cups down, and this attachment has saved many a sippy cup in the car. It's very easy to use and convenient. Worth the money.
B004HO5866|2|We were less than pleased with our purchase. My husband was off put by the size, we should have read carefully. Our daughter was too tall for the stroller, but we still used it. I had a hard time closing it, but my husband always figured it out.
B000WH4KYS|3|I received a pink cat, instead of the pink pig I ordered. The packaging all said pig, but cat inside.
B00191XEAM|1|I've had bundle me toddler and snuggle bub in large. the difference is huge: real lambswool is twice warmer than synthetic wool imitation in bundle me, the length of bundle me toddler will serve you for one year - max up to 2 years of age, if you baby happened to be tall european baby - 18 months is a top. Snuggle bub in it's turn served us from 12 months to 3 years, when we stopped using the stroller. yes, we had to put it lower, and by the age of 3 it was covering the lower part of the baby from the waist, but still. and absence of zippers make it less problems to worry about breaking.
B00007IT4X|4|This is a decent little car seat and the price is reasonable. I like the harness/belt adjustment on the front because it's easy to tighten or loosen the straps depending on the thickness of my child's clothes. For instance, in the winter sometimes she has on a big thick coat, but other times only a sweater. Having the adjuster on the front allows me to quickly loosen it to make room for her coat or tighten it if she isn't wearing a coat - no more having to take the car seat out of the car to do that!! <br />Another reviewer mentioned that their child figured out how to loosen the straps because the adjuster was on the front, but I think this would be rare and the child would have to be pretty big to do that - As an adult, I have to squeeze it very hard to get it to move as well as make sure it is in the correct position or it will not slide.<br />The straps do get tangled sometimes, but all other car seats I've tried have had the same problem. I don't think there's any great solution to that problem. You just have to be careful to straighten them out once in awhile.<br />The seat pad is nice and thick, but the first time I washed it, it faded quite a bit and frayed at the belt loop holes. It's still quite useable, but it just looks old now. That's probably my only real complaint about it.<br />I did call Evenflo to order some replacement seat pads to have on hand in the future and their customer service was great.
B004U7OQWW|4|I am using this in a Britax Advocate car seat with a newly potty trained toddler.  Recently, my toddler had a BIG accident while riding in the car seat. The piddle pad did not hold all of the liquid and I did have to wash the car seat cover.  HOWEVER---- the pad protected the car seat and the back seat of my car.  I didn't have to take the car seat out and my back seat was dry.  I just had to remove the car seat cover and wash it.  I think this piddle pad would work perfectly for little accidents.
B0042D69UQ|4|This product is make with simplicity and reasonably priced. I am not a big fan of vibrator at the bottom of this though. Overall, very nice product.
B000M0KKGC|5|We ordered this after our 2nd child was born.  Now we can watch both our kids in separate rooms.  The receiver has two channels to choose from so we can just switch back and forth.  It can be tricky however to locate the receiver in a spot so both channels come in clearly.  The new camera seems to be improved over the old one we have.  The picture is clearer and colors are better during the day.
B000LXQVA4|5|This may be the best $100 i ever spent. Bought it for my daughter when she was 5 months old. She liked it straight away, but it took her a few goes before she started to jump. She's now 6 months and LOVES it. She jumps like crazy and smiles and laughs in it. I love that I can put her in it and for 10 minutes i know she can't go anywhere so I can get a couple of quick chores done (whilst checking in on her every couple of minutes of course). The only downside I suppose is that it's quite bulky and not really easy to move, so it has just stayed in the same place in our living room. But it's definitely worth it for how much she loves it. Would recommend.
B00IFI2PNO|5|Great nipple brushes - best we've ever bought (and we've tried quite a few).  They're very sturdy (others we've had have snapped), and the brushes do a great job of getting the film off of the bottle nipples.
B007D1NKK6|1|Beware! This rail cannot be used with a platform bed that has a lip. Reviews are misleading or maybe product has changed, but we need to return it.
B007NG5UEU|1|The units do not stay linked.  They beep when re-linking which wakes the parent.  Amazon replaced one unit (Amazon Good VTech not so good).  Tried to get Vtech to replace the second unit which they would do only if I paid the shipping.  Back to Amazon.<br />Bought a Graco Secure Coverage Digital Monitor.  Works great and am getting a full nights sleep.
B001I481LM|5|Used this thing heavily for months and months, never had any issues with it. Was awesome when my baby woke every 2-3 hours screaming for food. I would make an entire batch (I suggest only making 30 oz at a time or else it will spill as you mix) and transfer it into a cheap rubbermaid drink container and keep his formula in the fridge. Then I would pour out what I needed during middle of the night feedings and warm under hot water for a minute or two. Worked great!
B00HIFM7XS|5|Works great
B002KCNEDG|5|Do not underestimate the amount of play a child can get out of these cups! We got these for my daughter for Christmas (she was 8 months old then), and ever since, these have been her go-to toy. She consistently bypasses the bigger, more expensive, flashier, frankly annoying toys the grandparents love to buy and goes for these simple cups. Now that she is walking, she loves to carry a couple cups in each hand and stack them, chew on them, put her paci in and out of them, and hit them together. I find them scattered all over the house :). I am very particular about what I let her play with (as a first time mom I am paranoid about all the toxic chemicals in most plastics), but I feel very comfortable letting her play with these cups, knowing that they are safe and free of all the harmful stuff. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. Love the price, love that they are &#34;green&#34;, love that they are well made and easy to clean, and love that my daughter gets so much enjoyment out of them, and is using them to learn new skills to boot! Definitely one of the best purchases I've made for my daughter.
B000U0R5D0|5|The mattress arrived so very quickly, I was surprised! Nice texture. Great fit. Our little grandson slept peacefully on it the whole time he was visiting!
B00IMHVYV2|4|Very pleased to have these. I bought 6-8 and we use them daily. Haven't had any troubles. Sometimes the top cap squeezes off the nozzle when were on the go but not much more than that. Easy to clean, my toddler uses them easily and seems to like the chewy texture.
B00IXN2JMS|5|Perfect way to bathe my baby and preschooler together. Cut time spent giving baths in half. Love it. Used a sponge in the back to help support baby at first. Not for a very small baby, obviously. Wouldn't try sooner than 4 months old.
B002O0A7OS|4|Looks great in the room with the bedding and valance.  Keeps the sunlight out too, very light filtering, the room doesnt even need blinds!
B00GY8J9BS|1|A critical screw fell off after maybe 14 uses (while we were at the airport no less) and it could not be located. Waste of money! Grr.
B008KG5R6I|5|I was so impressed with this magic music baby sleep putting fantastic amazing creation! I have a baby on the way and got totes it on my friends grumpy baby, she was so happy with the projected images images and the amazing sounds it puts off. I wish I had access to this with my son. This little thing works baby magic!
B00BEVF1XA|5|I am very pleased with this purchase.  I decided to buy the seat to use whenever our out-of-state four year old granddaughter visits. She loved the seat when she went on a trip with us.  She said it was very comfortable, and she enjoyed having the drink holders.  She wanted me to take a photo of it to send to her parents so they could see it.  We used the harness position, and the seat itself gave her plenty of room.  It is heavy and large.  I would not consider trying to carry it in an airport or use it on a plane.  The firemen who installed it for me said they were impressed with the quality of the seat and how it installed very securely.  Best of all, I feel my granddaughter is as safe as she can be in our car whenever she visits.
B000S8I5MY|5|The product was just what I expected, and turned out great at my new baby nursery, matching perfectly his \\"Twinkle Little Star\\" theme room! We loved it, and the price was also great!
B00ZQT051Y|5|This necklace is so cute. My nephew is in that teething stage where EVERYTHING ends up in his mouth and his shirts and onesies are a mess of drool and yuckness. I first gave this to my sister in law and she didn't realize what it was. She thought I was bringing her a regular necklace. My nephew seemed to know right away what out was for though because as soon as she had put it on he was all over it lol. The slight angles on the teethers seem to work well against his gums and the silicone is hard but with enough give that it's good to gum on. The entire necklace is dishwasher safe which makes it easy to keep clean and the string is nice for not only a necklace but also to tie off to keep secure and in his reach during walks or car rides. The only concern we talked about were the 2 smaller beads at the top because they could definitely cause an incident if baby somehow maneuvers once off of the string. We removed them and feel a bit safer. Other than that the necklace is an awesome idea and looks fashionable, it's a very cool gift idea. I received mine free for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions with this necklace. I am in no way obligated to rate or review this item in any way other than my honest opinion and receive no compensation for a positive review.
B00212QK1S|5|How do I love these?  Let me count the ways.......<br /><br />I actually use these as spit-up rags, for drool when my baby teeths, for cleaning up messes.... I don't actually use them for their intended purpose.  Despite that, these are amazing.  They absorb beautifully, and they hold up well to washing.<br /><br />If you plan to purchase these as diapers, please keep in mind that they shrink quite a bit if you throw them in the dryer.  Since I don't use them for that, a little shrinkage didn't bother me.<br /><br />These are well-made, they are durable, and I have never regretted spending money on them.  They will last long after my baby isn't a baby anymore!
B002UXQRKM|5|Promotes young kids to bush with child safe tooth gel at the early ages.  A great way to promote healthy living for young kids.
B0010BMIJO|5|Great product, everything (including box) was in excellent condition! Received unbelievably fast considering it being shipped to Hawaii.
B000J2DQPA|5|I bought it for my 2 years boy and my new born... I have to say that is very heavy.. but you will get used to it...  beside that I liked a lot.. you can turn the seats around so your little ones can play together... i will recommend this product ....
B000056HNX|5|These bottles are wonderful. They clean and sterilize beautifully and don't take on that worn scummy look as other blastic bottles. My daughter has reflux and part of the doctor recommendation was thicken formula- only Avent makes a nipple that infants can control their intake properly and without the parents getting fustrated and poking new holes or bigger holes in the nipples. The bottle wide size makes it easier to clean either by hand or dishwasher and children are comfortable learning how to hold it. I don't worry with too much air intake with my daughter and she successfully was able to do both breast and bottle feeding at the same time (less nipple confusion!).<br />A friend recommended the system to me and I now recommend it to anyone I know. It's worth the little extra it costs. I wish I started with Avent with my first child!
B00KCNIC0U|5|My son loves this!
B000PRUAFI|5|This gate is durable unlike other I have had. The stay open feature is perfect for what I needed in a gate.
B001ODA2KK|5|an amazing shape shorter toy. it's beautiful. it's well built and lightweight (so it's easy for little ones to pick up). it's fun. i am very pleased with this toy. the colors are vibrant and chip proof. i also love how the blocks have beads in them and make noise. my son is 11months so he hasn't mastered putting the shapes in the holes yet but he does play with this toy every single day for at least 30mins. he likes pulling them out and putting them back in the same way. i find other toys stuffed inside as well. he enjoys shaking the blocks.
B002UD65XQ|3|I always wash everything before I put it on the baby mattress, and this crib pad balled up with fuzz balls on first wash. I washed it separately too.  Seems the fabric is not that good.  I would send it back, but it is just a mattress pad.  However, I wouldn't recommend it.
B0040A12VW|3|I love the look of this bag, yet was a little disappointed in the size.  Initially it did the job, but now that I need to throw in a few changes of clothing, bottle bag, etc. it's just too small.
B000815R2W|5|I am a licensed family child care provider and purchased this couch for our library area after our cheapo one from a toy store ripped and fell apart after only 2 years.  I am soooo happy I bought this 4 years ago and so are the kids.  Ours is in blue.  It took only a few minutes to put together, is incredibly sturdy, the cushions are comfortable (though not foam-filled and super plushy, but I appreciate that as it seems to be more durable), and it can easily seat 2, if not 3, children.  The kids (unfortunately) have sat, stood, climbed, and even jumped on it (happened twice, never again after I took it away for a day) daily for the past 4 years, but it is still like new!  We also own the 2 chairs and table set from Guidecraft in red and love that set, as well.  If you need a sofa for your own children, classroom, or childcare, I HIGHLY recommend this one.  It's worth every penny!
B00CSAWIN2|4|It's  nice  and  compact.
B006Z2BZBU|5|He slept well. thanks
B003XDB91U|5|We've used these for two years now.  They are great and easily machine washable.  I just bought some more because we had another kid!
B002PU9IFQ|5|Bought this for my grandson.  He loves it!  Very soft!  Can't get hurt playing with this toy!  Just like Grandpa's tool kit for his Harley!
B000070IXH|5|I recently bought this bouncer for my little girl, she absolutely loves it. I loved that it had calming vibrations and most importantly head support. Most of the bouncers I've seen didn't come with head support. I also love the colors, it suits a little girl fairly well. If you're looking for a bouncer for a small baby girl, this is your best bet!
B0052QYLUM|5|I purchased this monitor and camera and then purchased another camera to keep an eye on my two kids. Such a great price for a product I have been very happy with.  It doesn't have a zoom feature or a scan feature but overall the camera works great so I have no complaints.
B00BH0P5CA|2|when it arrived had a bad front tire but pushed ok, now after 3 months the front tire has to be replaced for $30.00. would not buy again.
B0018CKHDY|5|We've been using cloth, but they didn't have the coverage needed for our 10 month old.  We wanted a pocket for catching cheerios that was also washable. These have been perfect! Other vinyl bibs are too plasticy--they are noisy and our son would rather play with them than eat! These are cloth-like and I just wash it in the sink, and hang it to dry for the next meal.  And I like things that aren't too babyish--he's a little boy now.
B003JPF6CA|2|I love the colors and the design! I hate the way that it's made!<br /><br />I assumed that the rug was made like a regular carpet with durable rug yarn. In actuality, it is made from ordinary synthetic yarn that is stitched/glued? down to the the rug backing in a pattern that resembles brains (not sure how else to describe). The rug seems to have attracted a great deal of dirt/pet hair/debris in a short period of time. Before mindlessly throwing it in the wash, I luckily read the cleaning instructions: \\"spot clean only\\". I was so disappointed. I tried to shake it out and sweep it but the yarn fibers began to fuzz up and looked like the loops were beginning to get snagged from sweeping it. I have not dared to vacuum it. It likely requires an old-fashioned beating over these more conventional methods rug cleaning and I actually ended up using a tape-style lint roller to meticulously clean it. Because we like the design so much and I was able to clean it up without completely destroying it, we plan to hang it on the wall so that our newborn son can enjoy it when he is old enough to do so.
B003F6ZU2E|5|The perfect small, tag blanket. Soft and cuddly. It's smaller than a stuffed animal, smaller than an actual blanket but baby can hold it close and feel comforted.
B00155WJMQ|4|Works as advertised and seems to be easy to take off and put on.  I think this is a good solution for those who need it.
B004UGM6TS|3|I give these to all women who are having little boys.  It's a FUN PRODUCT, but I'm not sure they do much good in keeping the little boys from spraying when being changed. LOL.  I will say, that many of the women had never seen these before, and all said it was a really fun gift to receive.  I usually give as a baby shower gift.  They usually get a good laugh at the patties.
B00881G426|5|It is great!
B004KT82AM|5|My son loves rattling/shaking it and sometimes chewing on it. I love that it is safe and not made in China.<br />He thinks it is the best thing ever when mommy puts it in her mouth and shakes it :-)<br />We definitely will be buying more from this company.
B0050JKKZQ|5|Love it!!! Smells great and it's tears free!!!
B00H07AZ42|3|These are stiff and a little bulky for daytime use.  They are odorless and they do absorb well. I prefer double layer hemp inserts over these.
B005VDX2RO|5|Music choices great. Plays long enough to put her to sleep.  I will grow with her as a music player.
B000I2MRLU|5|We got the Lamaze moose for our 4 month old daughter. It is the cutest thing! Perfect size for taking on the go and keeping at home. We also have the Princess Sophie and the pink dragon. All are adorable and perfect for their intent. We love them all.
B0027K2VOE|3|The picture paints this rug in beautiful colors, but I was very disappointed to find that the colors are MUCH more dull than the picture and the actual bedding set. While the designs match, the colors do not.
B0038OLMX4|4|This gate is very high-quality and sturdy--our strong toddlers efforts at pulling at it haven't moved it at all. But it's kind of narrow to get through and would be nicer if it swung open more widely.
B005HWFO3Y|1|It leaks very badly. Waste of money!! I had better luck with the Lil Gripper Sippy Cup- Playtex or try the First Years take and toss with straw. I have honestly tried all straw sippy cups, and those work best for us!
B007R56YEC|5|This turtle was a great purchase. First off the we received the shipment within a couple days, was surprised to see it that soon! I love the color of the light that projects off the ceiling, its the same color as the turtle. I like that the timer goes for twenty minutes and then turns off, you can use the music and the light or just the light option. Our baby stares at the light that surrounds her room with the soft melody of the ocean, and it puts her to sleep within about 10 minutes every time. Its perfect for her to concentrate her time on it, she doesn't even notice my absence from the room. The turtle is so peaceful that I could fall asleep watching the waves on the ceiling as well. Worth the money, its a cool item!
B00I8PH4QC|5|Washes well, my son loves the yellow elephants.
B00GUN3Z1W|5|Love this gate. I purchased a few of these over the years -- 41 to be exact -- and they never disappoint. Of course, the first few were prior to the speedy delivery and ordering process in Amazon Prime, regardless the gates are always exactly what they say they are and in great condition. I'm sure if I had thought about other uses for them, the original gates I purchased would be just as usable as they were when I first purchased them. They are durable, easy to use, and reasonably priced. Amazon Prime makes them even more affordable and their delivery from order date to delivering this afternoon is remarkable.
B000056OWC|1|I wish I read the reviews of the other mothers regarding this tub.  I would not have bought this tub.  I agree that this tub sounds like a versatile product, but it is not user friendly.  Since the 1st day we used it when my daughter was 2 weeks old, she slips down the tub everytime we give her a bath, her feet get hurt under the blue bar, and the suction cups do not work!!  No matter how you try to attach them to the tub or the tile around the sink.  To sum it up,  is a dangerous product!!
B008FXKKI6|5|I love this ! My grandson is nice and cuddly when he lays on it ! Washes very well !
B001CCHUTE|3|This nursing shield is certainly attractive---I love the chocolate brown and blue pattern, and I am grateful for the terry cloth corners on the inside of the 'skirt' portion, but I can never quite get the top part of the cover to drape right. Although the top hemline of the shield has a stiff border that allows it to stick out to (in theory) enable you and baby to have an unobstructed view of each other, the rest of the material is pretty flowy and ends up sitting on my baby's face or draping/falling in such a way that he gets tangled up and becomes VERY irritated as he tries to nurse. Many nursing attempts with this cover have resulted in wrestling matches between my baby and the material, which inevitably end up with me tearing the cover off and just nursing him out in the open as discreetly as I can. When this isn't an option (when more modesty is appropriate), my husband has had to sit and hold parts of the material away from us so it doesn't drape across my baby's face or impede his view of me. I have tried to adjust the neck strap to rectify this, but it has not resolved the issue. In short, I would say that I like the aesthetics of the cover, and in a pinch will still try to use it, but I was relatively disappointed in it. More recently, I've found it more useful for covering up when I'm pumping on the go (i.e. in my car). I probably would still purchase this item again because it's better than nothing, but I wonder if there's some way it can be made with a slightly more stiff material.
B00O9W3MUK|5|Great car seat. Bought this for our 1 year old and he loves it.  He seems extremely comfortable in it, he takes longer naps in the car than he ever has before, and the seat itself is great looking and seems very well made / safe.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Baby loves it. Seems comfortable in it, takes longer naps than he ever did before in the car (we're talking like 30 min-1 hour longer).<br />- Seems very safe and well made. The air head support cushions and overall strong / sturdy structure of the seat give us peace of mind.<br />- Looks great / very high end.  We previously had a Graco which functioned OK but looked cheap, and materials seemed very basic. Everything on this seat is higher quality - even down to the plastic snaps and the outside material.  We have gotten several compliments on it.<br />- Fit / room to grow.  It fits rear-facing in our 2012 Jetta sedan which is a smallish car -- behind the driver's seat and I am 6'1&#34;.  The seat is definitely big enough that he will be using it for a few years.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- A little wide for our Jetta sedan. We have squeezed 2 adults in the backseat with this car seat installed, but its definitely a little tight.<br />- Can be hard to tighten the straps to the point where they are really tight.  I've heard this will get better as they get broken in.<br /><br />Overall we are extremely happy with this car seat and would recommend it.
B007KG483C|1|leaks
B00ALOT55Q|3|Pen is heavy to move.  My dogs didn't like it, but I think it was ok.
B000JIJPZY|3|it's an ok toy but the description had me thinking it actually had music and did more than what it does
B009JV34RC|5|Good size. Came in fast. Will order again.
B000FL5090|5|Worked as needed.  The contour can be a bit difficult if you use bottles of multipe sizes.  Overall it's ok.
B001LQCOIS|2|We bought this item on August 5th, and through last week, it's just a little bit over 3 months. We bought it because we wanted to make good baby food for our son. We used it every day to make baby food for the little guy. It was a bit over 3 months and it broke!!! For an item that had a high rating as well as good reviews, we were expecting more. I was planning to return it and get my money back, but guess what?!?! The return date expires November 6th and ours broke just a week after that. Netherless to say, we are very disappointed and will not purchase this line of items or recommend to anyone!!!<br /><br />UPDATE (December 2013) - I changed my original 1 star to 2 star and here's why. I contacted Beaba through their own website and told them what happened. The person I was dealing with was SUPER nice and I ended up sending the broken one back to them and they sent me a new one! I have to say that I am happy with the Beaba customer service and their willingness to help!
B00J1LCNL8|5|Overall, its a great necklace! My LO loves to hold, tug, and teeth on it, and I don't have to worry about ruining my own real jewelry. Its a bit heavy feeling, but worth it to distract a very distractible baby while nursing!
B009DA2OHK|5|Brought for a co worker
B00C0PHS6M|5|Yes!  It was perfect!  Shipped promptly and my monitor has been salvaged!
B00CD3P1CE|5|My twins love these attachments.  They liked them more and more as they were able to reach and spin all the parts. This is one 'toy' that I don't mind leaving out...for whatever reason it looks nice and modern instead of kid toy bomb.
B007A2UAOC|3|You have to be pushing baby around pre 4-months in order to justify this.  If you are using the B-Ready stroller then you have to carry a separate seat or car seat then you need to have a Suburban or tractor trailer to carry all your gear.<br />The Velcro for the bottom part of the bassinet is hard to attach where it meets the bottom of the canopy.<br />There is a securing wide belt like thing in the bassinet that helps keep baby from rolling over.<br />The canopy is either open or 1/2 way as shown in pic - no way to close off for cold outdoors (throw a blanket over it).<br />disappointing for $100.
B003V7G7EM|1|Light was busted after the second night. Disappointed. I wish I can return it but we threw the box container already.,
B00BXE5M46|5|LO enjoys these sippy cups most. They are a good 1st stage cup since the nipples are similar to a bottle.
B005IA84M8|5|My first name is Jim.  We bought this monitor after having received input from five friends with newborns.  Most of them had many complaints about monitors that they have tried.  Two of them had the previous model of this item and each had but one complaint.  They wished that in video monitor mode the sound could be completely turned off.  Other than that, they felt that this was the best monitor on the market.  We've used it for three weeks now and I have no complaints.  It works well as long as I have the monitor on the same floor of my house as the camera.  When I travel to another floor, the monitor fades out of range in some rooms but not all.  Overall, I would recommend this monitor.
B0052QYLUM|5|I bought this to watch my mischievous 22 month old during 'quiet' time or sleep time in her crib. Boy, I only wish I had ordered it months and months ago. The picture is super clear and I was able to set up the monitor without the directions. The night vision on this monitor is spectacular and very clear and the sound is crisp. So far, I have noticed no interference as far as sound goes.<br /><br />Totally worth the $100. I'm due in March with another child and this monitor is set up for several more cameras that you are able to switch to. I will definitely be purchasing another camera to go with this unit for the new baby.
B003OQTPFS|5|This is my MUST have baby item! Every baby needs one. Helps them sleep, calms a fussy baby, and can be used when trying to feed a wiggle worm. Easier than a swaddle blanket but gives the baby the same feel.... keeps them tight like they are in the womb... hints the name \\"Wombie.\\" Worth every penny! You will not regret.
B00168Z532|1|I bought this, and several other Natures Purest toys, only to discover that they were not, in fact, 100% organic but a) NOT certified organic by a reputable agency, b) Made in China and c) filled with toxic polyester and/or foam.<br /><br />I was so disappointed after spending $200 on this brand -<br /><br />Stick to Under The Nile and MiYim for soft natural toys, and Haba and Plan for wooden ones.<br /><br />Best of luck -
B004B762AK|3|I bought this video monitor only 4 months ago to replace our InfantOptics video monitor.  I researched and researched and I chose this one over the Motorola.  Bad idea....<br /><br />I was happy with this monitor at first, until things started going haywire- the camera would randomly move (and no, I was not accidentally touching any buttons), the touch screen sucks and is NOT like a smartphone at all (like advertised)- more like crappy invisible buttons that only work half the time and now the \\"buttons\\" hardly respond to touch anymore which makes it difficult to do anything with it.  And now it's constantly going in and out of range for some reason (even if I'm standing next to it) and cuts off the video image and displays \\"out of range\\"... I've tried everything to fix it- restarting the camera, restarting the monitor, re-pairing them, deleting the camera and adding it again... NOTHING has fixed it and I'm TIRED OF THIS PIECE OF CRAP.  It is extremely inconvenient to constantly try to fix if while my son is sleeping.  And honestly- the image is not that great either.<br />I have yet to actually speak to a SI rep about this, but I have searched their site for help and that's about as useful as trying to figure out the issue myself.<br /><br />I wish I would've bought the Motorola one instead...<br /><br />12/16/13 UPDATE:<br />I finally was able to get a hold of their customer service and explained everything it's been doing and all of the steps I've taken to try and fix the issues....apparently it probably has an internal issue, so thank goodness this thing has a 12 month warranty.  So, now SI is sending me a prepaid shipping label so I can ship everything (including the cords) back to them and they're supposed to send me a \\"brand new\\" system.  So, we'll see how long this exchange takes...in the meantime I'm without a monitor which is a huge inconvenience for me, but I'll live.
B0000789TL|4|we recieved this as a shower gift for our son before he was born to go with the pooh theme we were going for in the nursery. 8 months later, it still makes him smile every time we wind it up. i like how the characters are easily removed and replaced. the music does run a little on the short side as far a duration goes and the big knob thing used to attach to the crib does stick out a bit. the knob didnt start bothering me until our son started climbing. now everytime he is standing in his crib i worry about him falling and bumping his head on the knob.
B00B7M7BKW|5|Easy enough to install and does it's job.
B001TIZCPK|5|The wristbands were on time. They will work fine.
B00FLXBHE4|5|My son is 9 yo, 4'9&#34;, 90 lbs. It gives him a good belt fit without the obviousness of a booster seat.  Dark gray is a dead match for the interior leather in a Honda.
B002JTWC0Q|5|Even though I used it very few weeks, I love that you can move the bassinet from room to room steadily.  The bottom part is also very useful to put things your baby needs. The mat is comfortable. I like this product
B00PE7RL38|5|Items were as described and arrived in good condition.
B004OR1DQK|5|Easy to use & cool colors too - matches our whole orange theme in the kitchen. Not ugly like most baby stuff. Boon is the best except when some of their things are Made in China, espeically baby utensils.
B002TOKHLM|1|Too hard nipple.baby wont use
B000RFCSMQ|3|this one will work, but it does not last as long as the other one (Philips Avent Bottle Brush, BPA-Free ) I purchased.
B00C3BQO2W|3|3 out of 5 stars because items description isn't the same as what was received.<br />This item states that it comes with 2 vanilla scented soothies and it doesn't. There is a soothie but its not vanilla scented and there is only 1. However the lion is adorable and I would purchase this item again if they correct the item description to a more accurate description.
B002J4U8M0|5|My little one loves this thing in his crib.  It attaches easily to the bars of his crib.  He often plays with it while he's falling asleep.  I love that it's not just a mirror but also has the little bugs that roll around and make sounds when he plays with them.  The only down side I have found is that as he is getting older and able to stand, he has fallen on top of it and gotten a little stuck.  Thank goodness for that baby monitor.
B000FFL58Q|5|Excelente producto
B00GS9B9UW|2|I just had my first baby 8 weeks ago.  I was SO excited to try these bras, as I plan to stay home and know I would be wearing them around the house a lot. I also wanted a cute bra to wear at the hospital in recovery.  First of all, they are cute, and second of all, they are really soft. I bought 3 of them (without knowing how they would fit, which I am usually nervous of when it comes to bras).  When I finally wore in the hospital, the nurses told me that I should probably get a more supportive bra...  Then, I realized, as it's my first time nursing, this bra was difficult to nurse from without adjusting the strap. When you have a hungry baby, I have found that the standard ones that snap off are really convenient. With this one, it feels like I am stretching the bra and damaging it's shape, so I slip the strap down to try and not damage it (which means I have to take off my shirt). Really inconvenient. Also, when I sleep, my breasts fall out of it if I am laying on my side. I bought exactly according to the size chart, and even emailed Bamboobies before I ordered, saying I was hesitant to buy without trying on, and not knowing what my breasts would feel like when my milk comes in.  The biggest issue I have is with the nursing pads -  First of all, I LOVE bamboobies reusable nursing pads. they work very well, I’ve never leaked in public, and I love not throwing away disposable ones. Plus, they don't stick to your nipples if your milk has dried and they are SO soft, which you’ll be thankful for those first few weeks.  HOWEVER, when wearing them with this bra, I am constantly having to readjust the pads to make sure they are covering my nipple, and when I am sleeping, they shift around and sometimes fall out.  They really don’t fit in the bra very well.This is very disappointing.  Overall, the bra makes me look saggy, even when I tighten the straps, and then there's not much more I can tighten it either, so I fear it will continue to stretch ( the nurses were right).  I am very disappointed at the money I spent on 3 of these - roughly $90 worth!  And I’ve only worn them a few times, and one of the seams has started coming undone. 
B00DGA06JQ|5|My Little Snugapuppy is an adorable baby swing and the baby LOVES it! It took me about 30 minutes to assemble it, and I am not the handyman type so that's saying something. It has soothing music and a wide variety of speeds and settings so that every baby wll be happy no matter what stage they may be. I like that it has an AC cord as I don't always have extra batteries handy so it is able to be used immediately upon set-up.<br /><br />Fisher-Price has developed an efficient swing that seems easy to keep clean. It is colorful and attractive to the baby while matching most home decors. The puppy motif is really cute and non-gender specific. Everyone loves puppies! My little one especially likes the mirror, and the hanging animals are attention grabbing. The swing is not too bulky so it doesn't take up much room in my home. I appreciate the adjustable seat, the baby can lie down or sit up, depending on his (or my) mood. I love having my hands free while the baby swings happily in the same room. I can get housework and schoolwork done while not having to hold an infant the whole time. I highly recommend this wonderful addition to the always reliable Fisher Price line of baby items. It's been a lifesaver!
B00008439C|5|Bought this for my boys who share a room. They take turns on which settings they will sleep to each night.  We even take it with us on vacation as it provides a feeling of home when sleeping in a hotel room.
B003XMWF2S|3|Bought it for our 1 1/2 year old grandson and it was a little awkward for him to handle & use. He resorted to a more traditional spoon or his hands!
B00AMVMNCU|5|I received a gently used pump from my cousin and wanted to replace all the pieces that had touched milk etc. This was an excellent kit and contained everything needed for my Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breastpump in the backpack. Great price point when compared to other similar products.
B005XTKIBO|1|I was initially very happy with this cup and bought multiple for milk and water. Then I discovered the mold and who knows what else growing underneath. The top is hard to get off and feels like you are breaking it-  I actually did end up breaking one. Once I stopped using this for my son's milk and switched to thermos foogo straw cup his stomach issues cleared up. Not worth the risk. Learned my lesson- always make sure everything thing can come apart and be cleaned easily .
B007FCMJ8M|2|I wanted to like these...I really, really did. Our daughter needs to be swaddled and regular blankets are not cutting it anymore. We are on our THIRD Halo now and the Velcro on all 3 is horrible!!! After one wash (following the care instructions exactly) the Velcro is useless. It doesn't stick, rolls up, and is lumpy! I would love to have the over $60 we have now spent on these sleep sacks back! So disappointing.
B00FLXBSJ8|5|My baby has liked snuggle blankets since she was born.  This quickly became her favorite and we keep it in her crib.  She often wakes up and plays with it for up to an hour before even making a sound to wake us up.  More sleep time for Mommy and Daddy!  We love it!
B002KGHUL4|3|Many breastfeeding moms raved to me about this product and how it would save me during the initial weeks of breastfeeding. Being an Amazon Prime member, I thought I had stumbled upon a great deal when I thought I would receive 2 boxes (2 pairs), per the item description. The description is misleading. If you choose \\"2\\" you get one box - a pair. The price here is not any better than what you would pay at the drugstore. Furthermore, this was the worst packaging I have ever seen from Amazon - a flimsy padded envelope. The item's box was crushed and had clearly been opened. The product inside was fine, however, and works great. Definitely a godsend! I will just pick it up locally next time.
B008818MEE|5|Luv these! Ordering more!
B004CT6QKI|4|I guess I didn't realize these would be REAL METAL.  I was thrilled when they arrived.  My 10 month old son on the other hand was interested  for about 5 minutes.  I think the fact that the don't \\"jingle\\" like regular keys takes away from the allure.  All in all, I like the toy, just wish my son did too!
B0067GKHQS|5|LOVE this dispenser!
B00PI2FPXW|2|I purchased this bag on January 28. I didn't start using it until I went back to work on April 14th. It's August 11, so I've only been using this bag for 4 months. I've gotten tons of compliments on the bag. It's super cute and doesn't look like a pump bag at all. However, the edges have been wearing down considerably and they look very frayed. Very disappointed that I spent $185 on a bag that looks like it's falling apart after just 4 months.
B00BUPU1OE|4|It wasn't as soft as the other ones I have, but softened up after a few washes.
B001WAJVZM|1|I'm puzzled by all of the positive reviews on this product. We have a standard tub spout but this protector just wouldn't stay on. I tightened and fussed with it for days and ultimately returned it. Maybe the reason is that I didn't have a pull up shower button on that spout, maybe that is what keeps it from falling off? I definitely would not recommend this product if you don't have a pull up knob for the shower.
B00005BXKM|2|I have found that this bottle warmer makes the bottle either too hot or not hot enough (even if you follow the directions on how much water to use) and you have to wait ten minutes to start the cycle over again - that is TOO long to wait when you have a screaming, hungey baby who needs to eat!  It's easier (and cheaper) to run hot water over the bottle, it takes the same amount of time and you can control the temperature.
B0062WS2KA|5|By far one of my favorite diapers. Not only for  brand but color as well. I love the pockets minus the fact that  microfiber at times can contain stink and need to be cleaned extra harder. I use the actual diaper many times with flour sack towels inside so it is 100% cotton which also absorbs better. These fit my son as of 11lbs and he is 21lbs and will be wearing until potty training. I love the rise snaps and sides that stretch. Very trim fitting!
B00FK599DE|5|This item is actually made by maymom, not Medela, but fit perfectly with the Medela pump in style pump and bottles. The breast shield and connectors are actually one piece, not two, which makes cleaning a bit easier because there are fewer parts to disassemble. The neck of the connector is longer than the Medela brand parts, which forces me to sit up very straight while pumping or else the bottles are in my lap. As it turns out, the 21mm size is a tad too small for me; but otherwise these worked perfectly with the pump and I would recommend them you are in need of a smaller shield.
B007A4N09C|5|This is an amazing product!! Takes care of diaper rash and other skin issues without all of the hazardous chemicals that are found in most diaper rash creams.
B0044R7I1O|5|We are very satisfied with this item. We have had it for a year now and it has served us well. I even use it as a step stool to get dishes out of the cupboard. We are now purchasing another one for our second child. The only complaint I have is the padding on the chair does not stay on well, it likes to slide forward. Because our 3 year old does not use the straps we use them to keep the padding in place.
B00GICQ3VY|1|Opened up the kit, part of the clay was already dried out and I had to snap it off. Remaining clay was so sticky I couldn't roll it out and had to try to press it out with my hand. It wasn't fluffy and light as it needed to be but dense and sticky. I could barely get enough flattened for my child's hand. There was no way I could've used the clay cutter to make a heart shape later. I pressed his hand down until he protested and still couldn't get his impression in the clay. I tried several times, pressing out the lousy clay each time and pressing down the poor kid's hand. Could NOT make it work. Finally this whole thing went into the garbage and I was SO DISAPPOINTED not being able to get his hand print on his BIRTHDAY like I wanted. Thanks a lot Pear Head!
B000I2OKDI|5|I bought these magnetic blocks when my baby was only 6 months old.  She tried to build with them and cracked up over knocking them over even then.  She is now 18 months old and gets great satisfaction from the fact that she can build them up (I can see it in her face).  I liked them so much I bought a second set so that she could build even higher.  (They only go about 9 tall before they sway and fall-but isn't that 1/2 the fun?)
B00H8MSLE0|5|Love it, the hooks that tie down like a car seat make me feel better then just using the lap belt.
B004GK70K8|5|We love this clock! The light that switches from night time to day time is great. We turn the alarm off on the weekend and my son just goes by the light, he can get up when it's &#34;daytime&#34;. Recommend this clock!
B00NLNR0JC|5|Really soft, which surprised me because they were so affordable.
B005G3QSF2|5|MI bought this product from other reviews I read. I am a full time mom and my husband needed something to warm up my milk-warm water wasn't cutting it for him. The kozii doesn't disappoint-works great for frozen or refrigerated milk. I feel better knowing that the heat doesn't diminish the nutrients in the milk. Its small-so it doesn't take up alot of counter space. My husband has no complaints.
B00DBKFFJM|5|As a working mom, I needed a solution for pumping that would be comfortable and effective. I had been using a Medela personal double pump (like the PISA with fewer features). Pumping with the Medela 3-5X a day left my breasts sore and I hated pumping. I did a lot of research and found that Spectra consistently had the best reviews. When the S1 became available, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />The S1 is all together great. It is quiet, doesn't tug/pull the way the medela did. All together, it makes pumping a far less annoyance. Don't get me wrong, pumping still isn't fun, but at least it isn't painful.<br /><br />Pros of the s1: super quiet (I can take conference calls while pumping), gentle, light weight, incredibly effective (my supply is now WAY too much - trying to figure that out....)<br /><br />Cons: the bottles aren't great, no carrying case.<br /><br />I couldn't take stars away for the two superficial complaints I have. Overall, I would suggest to any mom that they should give Spectra a chance. It's been wonderful for me!
B00GUU3EU2|3|When this first I arrived, I was so excited!  I thought it was exactly what I needed for my baby, who loves to thrash her arms around in her sleep and managed to escape her Velcro bag swaddle every time.  I thought the Woombie would be better because she would still be able to move her arms, but wouldn't be able to hit herself in the face.  Unfortunately, it just didn't work for us.  There was too much give in the material ..she could still throw her arms around way too much and wake herself up. For the good points, the size seemed accurate, and I loved the convenience of the bottom zipper.  I wish it had worked out, but it didn't.  We have had much better results with the Summer Infant SwaddleMe.  The Velcro is really strong and wraps around the side so she can't escape!
B006ZVV0NO|1|They don't stay up on my rear window, but do on the side windows. So unless your windows are all perpendicular to the ground  (i.e. not slanted like the rear window of a sedan), be prepared to tape these to your windows.  Update*** Downgrading these to a zero. I ended up throwing them away because they wouldn't stay up
B009SP943M|1|It was ripped and didn't fit . Very unhappy
B00YUQUD16|5|This is the best thing I have ever invested in! It's easy to change my baby without the fear of germs and my daughter getting sick from all of the germs. I lay her on the purple changing part and have my diapers and wipes right next to me in the pockets on the side. I can carry so much in this almost like a small easier diaper bag without as much items. I definitely advice getting this for yourself or as a baby shower gift! Received at a discount for my honest unbiased opinion!
B004W02YMG|5|This pillow is incredible for pregnant women.  My wife is eight months pregnant and was having the worst time sleeping peacefully.  We tried everything, pillows, foam mattress toppers, etc.  Then we got this and she has had great rest.
B00N2CT02W|2|Very flimsy and did not hold the full 4 ounces in the description. They close like a zipper bag and one good squeeze and they would open up and make a mess. The caps ate also kind of small and their round shape seems like it would me a choking hazard.
B000046S3T|5|Keeps the kiddos from electrocuting themselves and/or unplugging my lamps. Yippy for no crispy children!
B001IPCR8E|5|i keep this with my keys. great for distracting while waiting in line to get my coffee, etc. ..adorable too. People always comment on it an ask where i got it.
B005XTCMSQ|5|My 15 month old son discovered the knobs on the stove and it was not safe at all.  These covers look nice unlike most child safety products.  He still will go up to them, but he cannot turn the stovetop on because he cannot get to the knob.  They were super easy to install too. Great invention!
B000AV7O4O|2|This frog is adorable and I wish I had read the review about writing to the company for extra adhesive before I returned it.  I followed the directions EXACTLY- cleaned area, dried thoroughly, used alcohol, waited a full 24 hours, did not cross the grout line etc.  It fell down in the middle of the night and woke up my child.  It went back to Target the next day!  If you are willing to figure out a way to make this stick beyond the normal directions, it is a very cute bath accessory.
B004Y9AKZI|4|Portable and easy to set up! Mattress is suppose to be firm for newborn babies but it appears to be uncomfortable at times for my little one. It's still a good buy especially for traveling parents.
B00062LFYC|1|This gate looked like a perfect solution from the picture on the box.  However, there are definitely some things that need to be disclosed.  See those black hinges?  That's not metal.  It's plastic...very cheap and flimsy plastic at that.  The gate locks in place at the top and bottom, however, because the plastic hingest are flimsy, the top part may unlock and move outward while the bottom point is still locked in.  This can be somewhat dangerous so you really have to make sure that both points are open.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the text on the box advertises that the gate expands to 40.5\\".  It also says that two extensions are included so there's nothing extra to buy.  Well, keep in mind that the base width of 40.5\\" does include the two extensions.    After buying this, I also purchased the First Years Hands-Free Gate which turned out to be a very solid and well-made product.  Check that one out instead.  I'm considering buying a second First Years gate to replace this one altogether.
B00005QBWZ|4|I will start off saying this warmer will quickly dry out your wipes.  Yet, there is a switch on the cord that is readily available.  We turn it on in the eveing, so that midnight changes and early morning changes are warm.  Then, we turn it off for a while.  I like this product even if it does not warm the wipes.<BR>Second benefit is that it can be mounted to the changing table.  Everything is right there when you need it.  We have the alcohol, for baby's umbilical cord, in the organizer.<BR>That is the third benefit.  It has a handy organizer.  You can stack several diapers and most of your diaper needs right at the table. <br />While, if constantly on, the warmer may dry out your wipes, this product is very useful is done right.  It is convenient and handy.  Then, you baby gets a warm bottom cleaning when he is still sleepy.
B002UOE1IQ|5|I am so glad that I purchased this sleep bag to replace our pac-n-play when our granddaughter got to be almost two-what a perfect bag for her-she absolutely LOVES it! And we love it too because we just roll it up and put it in the closet when she is not at our house-so much easier and more attractive!
B005BTPDD4|5|Super cute and colorful..
B0006FHBBA|2|A couple of the bottles leak badly!
B006UDLXKW|4|I like the concept of this nursing cover, but i find the material to be hot. Also it is really awkward to line it up right to see down the opening. You have to extend the opposite corner over your leg so it doesn't bunch up at all.<br /><br />Update as of July 2013: I have been using this more regularly and find it much less awkward now that feeding is just easier! I like how I can bunch it up into my bag, or wash it and the rim doesn't get affected at all. My only complaint is that it is difficult to adjust the neck strap with one hand as you are supporting your little one with the other. You at times need to make the strap big to get around your hair (if it is up) and then you need to tighten it so you are not exposing yourself. I think maybe a different buckle that slips a little more easily would do the trick? All in all, a good product!
B008YE64UE|2|I bought this diaper cover to use with our cloth inserts.  After she pees, we have to change the whole diaper because she feels wet!  I will not be buying this product again.
B00NLJAU8E|4|Got this for our toddler.<br /><br />It functions perfectly as intended and is very easy to install and get my daughter strapped into it.<br /><br />She loves the cupholders and she seems to be comfortable.  She loves having a &#34;big-girl&#34; seat now.<br /><br />Because the color is not too over done (we got the one with purple lining and purple/pink designs - but is mostly a flat greyish-black), it can easily go in our car's more basic and flat color scheme.<br /><br />My only request is that this chair come with the same metal clips that infant car seats are outfitted with (the ones that physically clip the chair onto the car). It would make the chair that much more secure.  As it is, the only thing that really holds the chair in place is the fact that our daughter is sitting in it with the seat belt holding her and the seat down.  Would receive 5/5 if it had this.
B00O9W3MWS|5|Love the color, my 1 year old seems very relaxed and comfortable in it. The cup holder is great for her water cup or toys or snacks and the fabric removes easily for machine wash which is a big plus! I all around love this car seat and am super happy with my purchase and recommend it to any other parent. The only thing that is a bit hard is pushing the buttons on the strap when I take my daughter out, I have to push really hard! But I'm sure that's to make sure a child can't get out themselves and for extra protection. Thanks for an amazing car seat!
B000LPZTQY|5|Love, happy shopping at a time
B00HG4VJTO|5|Received!! So cute !! Smaller than expected but I love it !
B00F9Q3ETE|5|Love it! It's the perfect accessory to my B.O.B stroller. Dual cup holder, side pockets, portable tire pump, and a zip area for cash, cards phone. It's sturdy, and easy to Velcro on.
B00008E1OB|3|I recently got this item via UPS and I don't know if it was them or Target that damaged the entire thing or what, but it came opened with pieces falling out, missing and it was the wrong color that I wanted. Well, I sent it back immediatley, and Target shipped out a new one, this time in two boxes. My husband and I assembled it very easily, and it looks great. I't real sturdy, but there were three shelves missing. So now I'm waiting for target to ship those out as well. The shipping dept. is obviously no good, but I can vouch for the actual product. Aggravation and all, overall I love the item!!!! I feel good knowing my lil one will be on something sturdy and made with real wood. Thanks!!!!!!!!
B004HFQOLI|5|the best brand on baby things
B00A7X8VSS|4|beautiful
B00D2YUGP0|5|It is what it is - great replacement part.
B007R6VKDQ|5|Tried it immediately and found the thermometer was accurate and very easy to use.  The light came in handy, great buy.
B000YDDF6O|5|My son loves it. I thought it had broke but my son must have drooled on it little too much, once it dried out it worked again like normal. Most of his toys don't stand up to his abuse, but this one works fine.
B009WDZ0JW|5|Love this product!  Works perfectly in our nursery and matches wonderfully with our peanut and snoopy crib set that we purchased
B000WJLKQM|5|[[VIDEOID:mo78Q8Q1CQSW3H]]My 3 month old little girl loved it, but I had to send it back because I only had 1 doorway that I could hook it to.  It was in the closet of our bedroom and that wasn't going to do.  I sent it back but I wish I could have kept it.
B00NBF7Z9U|5|I must admit I was expecting a low quality product that was durable enough to last a few months, but imagine my surprise that the product was not only beyond my quality expectations but absolutely beautiful. This product is made 10x better than most American products.
B00A4B34IA|5|My daughter has used it since born. Now she is 19 months and she still likes to sit on it to relax. We are buying another one for our second baby because we don't think our big baby would like to share. :)
B00PYXV89U|5|Love it!  This is a great teething necklace, and it's so cute!  My baby boy goes right for any jewelry I'm wearing, so I might as well wear something he can safely chew on, right?  Great job, Mama and Little!
B00BU8A74U|5|Perfects!!!!!
B000BXHPEU|5|Great! Very sturdy, compact and easy to clean!
B003LEN7TI|5|Bought this for my daughter in law. We did her belly cast Aug 25 and she went into labor the next morning (about 2 weeks early) so we didn't get to paint it. It was very simple just a little messy which was to be expected.
B00004D3EU|5|The mother to be loved this gift. From my understanding it held up great. From my looking at the gift before giving it seemed soundly made, functional and safe.
B004OY5R6U|5|OK. I was scared at first because the writing on the case is in German, but its the numbers. Completely OK for any language.  Also they are beautiful!
B004YL338M|4|Great product and cheaper than at retailers in my area.  Great way to feed my infant snacks at a restaurant when she was learning how to pick up food.  Easy cleanup after our meals and I didn't feel like a rude customer at restaurants by leaving a mess.
B001IYD6VM|5|I bought this to use with my First Years Wave Stroller, and it fits very well (I am currently using the stroller in the bassinet mode). It comes with a handy carrying case (approx. the size of a soda can) that you can easily store in your stroller basket or parent tray, or just hang from your stroller handle. I have been using this on a daily basis, and am very pleased with this stroller netting.
B00EVXHE5G|5|Love the color and love the fact that it doesn't pull my hair like another one I have purchased. I will be buying more of these!
B001PGKPEY|5|Purchased for our 21 month old son. Bought extra large and it's perfect. He still has growing room and he's already 3 feet tall. I like the piece of mind he can't climb out of crib in it. We plan to have him in his crib as long as possible so this works wonders. Perfect as a wearable blanket and he seems to love it!  Planning to buy a small one with the flaps for our baby girl when she arrives in May!
B000X4K7JW|3|When I ordered this toy, I liked that it was made of fabric and wood, rather than plastic, given the concerns about endocrine disruptors and children these days. And with the variety of colors and shapes it was still visually stimulating, unlike some plain wooden toys. But after some use, whatever lacquer utilized to seal the wood was peeling and I discontinued use for fear of my child ingesting anything harmful. I wish some non-toxic vegetable glaze/sealant had been used instead or at least, whatever was used, was clearly labeled, so a choosy parent would know in advance.
B009EDSWJA|5|great fit
B00V3CXHQ8|5|I got mine free from Tomoson for a product review but below is my own unbiased opinion. And I get to have a giveaway so one lucky person can try it out too!<br /><br />I love this, and didn't know they even made teething necklaces. This was a perfect product for me with perfect timing as my little one has started the process of teething and has recently discovered my hair is fun to play with. This necklace takes the place of my hair and helps with both of those.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect it feel like when I got it, or if my baby would like it but she does.<br />It's actually soft feeling, but tough enough to chew on. It's not bad looking and the black and grey colors make it easy to pair with almost any outfit, fancy or casual. I have gotten compliments on it already by people and NO ONE knew it was a teething necklace until I told them. Which wa suffer to see their reactions to that knowledge.<br /><br />What make smell happy is that I know it's safe for my baby because it doesn't contain any of these:<br />* BPA<br />* PVC<br />* Phthalates<br />* Lead<br />*Latex<br />Or any harmful chemicals and toxins<br />It is hypoallergenic and bacteria resistant which is great since it spends a lot of time in your babies mouth.<br /><br />Like I said, it is definitely fashionable and functional and can be for day or night. It's designed to be long to accommodate any holding style with your baby and is good for entertaining your baby while keeping their attention on the necklace and not your hair. :)<br />It is also good for use as a sensory/tactile object and could be ideal for people with disabilities. And it could be good for people, who may not have babies, but have an allergy to other types of fashion jewelry,  which I am. So it is doubley good for me.<br /><br />I love this necklace and it is fun to watch my baby play with it and chew on it. I can breathe a sigh of relief knowing it's safe for her too.
B000TFGUC8|5|My son loves this gym.  He squeals and chatters away while playing on it.  It has been a lifesaver for me due to Jack being such a high need baby (Needs to be held most of the time, and more fussy than not).  He has spent over 45 minutes playing on this mat!!!  The music is really fun, and the lights are a nice touch.  Jack has been using this from about 2 months of age on, and loves to grab and shake the rattle (which is not cloudy on my mat) and will grab and shake the other toys at the same time.  It is so much fun to hear him having such a good time : )
B003TRVFJG|5|This was the most excellent purchase of baby goods I could have ever made for my daughter of twins. Sturdy stroller and folds to fit. When you have twins their is just enough room for the twins and the umbrella stroller. Very well made not alot of money. If you need one this is the one to purchase.
B004VN17JU|5|the quality is really good and designed for two babies. it is really wonderful and is easy to fold it
B00NA95W38|5|Finally a thermometer which doesn't vary 3 degrees between readings. So thrilled to have found it!! Tried the Braun,  Vicksburg and Exergen... this is hands down the easiest to use most accurate.
B00DZ0MAD2|4|They are cheaper than Johnson and Johnson face wipes but these wipes are smaller in size.
B0011E4IIO|5|This support pillow is very versatile in supporting an infant's head and body in the early months.  It is great for support when feeding a bottle as well as elevating the baby to a semi sitting position.
B000V8G07I|2|If there is a bottle/nipple brush that holds up very well over a long period of time, I'd like to know about it!  I certainly don't want to buy a new brush every month.  I have rated this with 2 stars because the nipple brush (which is attached to the handle) breaks off after about a month.  I like the idea of the nipple brush, but not the quality.  The bottle brush end, though, is very efficient.  I do like the dense sponge at the end... I think the bristles could be more dense & longer so as to scrub a bit better, but overall it cleans bottles fine with a little twisting of the wrist :)  Are these things made to last only for a short period of time?  'Seems that the manufacturer wants us to come back to buy more on a regular basis.  BTW, incase you're wondering, I use this brush on a daily basis & clean 3-4 nipples a day.  Again, if they could design the nipple brush to last, I would have given it 4 stars... Improve the bristles a bit, and I'd give it 5 stars...
B003SC9TQI|5|I purchased the slipcover and the duvet, we wanted to similute our bed and we really did, she loves it and help her sleep thru the night....
B008CDR7LW|2|It looks bigger in the picture and there's no way kids can really play a toss game with this. It's tiny! I really thought it was bigger.
B008KIQ6MK|5|We have had several bottle scrubbers and these are definitely the best. Some don't have sponges on the ends like these and we really do you like that feature. Others we've had that are very popular don't even fit in the majority of the bottles so what's the point? This is our second set and we love them.
B00KLO5F78|5|LOOK and FEEL: I really like to purchase items that are the perfect mix of form and functionality and do a lot of research to find what I want.The material and clean lines of this product really set it apart from its competition; it looks and feels much more sleek and expensive than most others that I looked at and blends in much better with my stroller. I like that there is not a prominent product logo or extra colors and designs on it. I also like that the insulation material is very high quality; several I looked at had either the shiny silver lining which has torn on other baby products I have or the standard white lining like most lunch sacks that is hard to keep clean. The lining on this is black which adds to its sleek appearance. I've gotten several compliments on it from moms with similar items on their strollers.<br /><br />PROS: It works beautifully on my Valco Baby Zee stroller (folds with it, too) and I love the (thin, hidden) metal frame around the top that helps it maintain its shape so it doesn't collapse in on itself.  The mesh pocket along the back was perfect for stashing pamphlets, maps and cardboard fans at a recent outdoor festival. The magnetic closure on the top center compartment is strong and secure and that area is perfect for stashing a small wallet/wristlet, keys, phone, small toys, snacks, etc. The insulation of the cup holders was very effective. The Velcro seems secure as it held on strong during an all day festival over lots of pot holes and bumpy grass with two full water bottles and other items in it. I don't know how often I will detach the front compartment but it is the perfect size for a wallet, larger phone, or even one or two diapers.<br /><br />CONS: The mesh slip pocket on the front is barely large enough for a standard iphone 6 (no way a plus or anything larger would fit). I had to pay attention and use two hands to get the phone in and out of it which was just too cumbersome on the go so I ended up stashing my phone in the center top compartment. I had specifically wanted to use the mesh pocket so I could see messages come in. Not a huge deal to me but it may be to you. And, it may just be that I need to stretch it out a bit more and it will get better with time.<br /><br />NEUTRAL: I haven't figured out a use for the zipper mesh compartment on top of the center compartment lid. Its small without much give. The best use I could think of was for a parking stub or similar (though if it got wet from rain or drinks, it would get damaged) I also couldn't figure out a way to carry a standard &#34;pop top&#34; wipes package but it would probably be too heavy anyways, especially combined with drinks and other items, so not a big deal. I ended up just putting some wipes in a baggie in the front compartment.
B004XFEYVE|1|These broke almost immediately.
B00LMV9LYC|1|poor insulation,boiling water will be cold quickly and the bowl cover lock is not very well.So I don't like  this Jar.
B00005QI1G|4|This bouncer is great! I've been using it since my 11 week-old baby was born. Not only does he get fascinated by the toy bar and the music but I can also keep him close by whithout carrying him when I have to cook or take a shower. The seat is very light and can be carried around the house even with baby in it although it's not made for that purpose so be careful. My son ends up falling asleep with or without the vibrations and seems to be very comfortable. This bouncer is a great alternative since he hates lying down when he's awake and he enjoys watching me. The bar comes off easily, you just pull it. So overall a great product for young infants who can't sit up on their own.
B00I6IGF4I|3|Didn't love velcro around the waist/hips -  couldn't get it tight enough.
B006PB2B6O|5|i shopped and compared this to store seats, I bought it on sale from Amazon and saved over $100 , and it's so easy to adjust and secure in the car but is so sturdy and holds up well
B007L21MA2|5|It's Eric Carle....what's not to love?  The pictures are beautiful, the colors are lovely, the box is just about frameable itself.  The tiniest block is perfect for little hands and there are so many ways to use these blocks.  Sturdy and durable, they've put up so far with our baby's older siblings &#34;helping&#34; her play.
B000IDSLOG|5|Awesome toy!  Yes it reminds me of a dog toy, but our son loves it!  He eats it, squeaks it, touches it, and bends it.  My favorite feature is that it is soft.  Nothing to hurt himself on.   Brilliant toy idea!  A little pricey but in my opinion worth every penny.  I would buy again and reccomend it!
B000VROULC|5|I love the fact that the puppies faces are downward toward the baby instead of the [...]! I wish the song was a little less original though. Twinkle, Twinkle little start gets a little old. The colors are awesome and fit nicely with the dark crib we picked for our son!
B00A7YR9VM|5|Perfect cover with all types of weather.  Fits any car seat. My daughter is well protected in rain, snow, or wind.
B00020L78M|5|I bought this for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and it is wonderful!!  I use it while I am working at home or doing chores and can't be distracted by him!  He loves going into it.  Has enough room for his bed, blankets and food/water if I needed to leave him while I left the house.  It is easy to put together, I only used 4 of the panels and that seems to be just fine for him.  He does chew on it but the grooves are not big enough for him to hurt himself.  He also can not even consider jumping out of is as he is too small.  I don't recommend for large dogs once they grow as they are almost as tall as this pen but for small breed dogs it is wonderful and has saved me a lot of time!!  The cost is also amazing!!  Petco sells it for about $50 more!!  Free shipping here and no sales tax!!
B00648KZ8O|4|Baby not yet born, and now stockpile, looking forward to good use, follow the trend to buy such good effect after use continue to buy, I believe that something very good
B00BGAMK60|5|My favorite bibs, hands down!  They can be rolled up easily (space saver).  They are easy to wash in the sink or the washing machine.  They catch dry and wet food and hold it in the pockets perfectly.
B004W3FVY6|5|I live in a sunny place and this product cuts out so much glare.  I love it.
B001CWVYMI|1|This bag is extremely cheap.  The entire bottom ripped open the first time we used it to transport the baby seat on a plane.  We could have used a black garbage bag and got the same results.  Don't waste $15 like I did.
B00CIOXTF4|5|My 2 month old loves this toy. Help put her to sleep & keeps her sleeping. It's been a lifesaver for car rides, since she hates being in her carseat.
B002USE15U|5|daughter in law loves these.  She uses then above all of the other receiving and other blankets...large and so soft and you can double them or use single thickness to cover to protect from sun...they are really good and well worth the money.
B000MXJ30S|1|Thought it did more. Not much to it at all.  Needs more activity than just a few buttons beeping.  Would send back but not worth it.
B00HPQTLRU|5|This great quality the only draw back is the brackets are plastic but I imagine they are built to last!  They even have these paper strips that make it impossible to mess up the install. I even at a 9 month old and a 3 year old helping and I didn't get frustrated!  Definitely a great buy and I love it opens as wide as the stairs, and no bar to trip over! Love it!! It does need screwed in to the wall.
B00AM5NTIS|5|So far these are the only reusable pouches I've used. I researched, read reviews, visited 5 stores in the Windy City of Chicago before ordering these.<br />I love them for the following reasons:<br />1. Easy to fill and freeze.<br />2. The top. It's a zip pouch. What else would you need?! The opening is big enough for cubed frozen food and to be able to just pour in the purée's. Or spoon them in. Whatever.<br />3. Clean super easy. I put mine in the top rack of my dishwasher. (As a side note, they withstand 185 degree hot water.)<br />4. That spout on the side. This makes it so much easier for my 7 month to hold.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe I'm missing out on a better option. But who really wants to spend an extra $25 dollars on a gadget that holds and fills the pouches. Silly. As the first reusable pouches I've tried, they're awesome!
B000231GF8|5|easy to use.  new mommy loved it so much she's using the same system for baby number two expected soon
B00073HJG8|5|I have a lot of stuffed animals that the grandkids no longer play with, but are sentimental memories to me so this was a great way to save them!
B00KCNIRX2|5|She likes it. That's the main point. I also like that she can hold onto it easily with the handle.
B00WR81BXS|1|I ordered this but never recieved it and since i ordered other product from Jastores at once THEY THOUGHT THEY CAN USE MY HEAD & DECIDE FOR ME TO SEND ME ANOTHER SIMILAR IDEA PRODUCT WHICH LOOKED VERY UGLY AND WAS THROWN BY ME IN THE TRASH
B001D7JO1U|5|Halo swaddle sacks work so much better than many I have tried.  They are secure and I don't worry about them getting around my baby's face.  The swaddle is easily adjusted and can be wrapped under the baby's arms once the are too big to swaddle.  The zipper is attached so that you can leave them swaddled while changing a diaper.
B000RRD7UG|5|This is a great product for those with small children.  We used this for our first trip with our 4 1/2 month old daughter.  Easy to open and easy to store in the attached pouch.  Everyone at the SW gate desk loved these.<br /><br />****NOTE: THESE ARE NOT TO BE CHECKED AS BAGGAGE!***<br />These cannot be covering your car seat or stroller while going through security check.<br /><br />They may not last past a few trips, but for the cost it makes them worth it to ensure that the stroller/car seat are protected from the elements.<br /><br />I highly recommend them to everyone.  We have told all of our friends that have kids about these!
B003IP8RRM|3|We've had two of these break, and the third one sticks a lot. That being said, it does it's job and we couldn't live without it.
B00BSX13PO|5|Socks fit perfectly!
B00JNGYIFK|5|Perfect is the word good quality n good price
B0000E6ZC6|5|After waking to serious screaming from the nursery to find her six month old had caught her leg between the crib rails my daughter and I searched for a solution to the problem. Thanks to reviews from other parents who had experienced similar problems we found the Crib Shield System. It works perfectly.Although baby Emma tries she has not had a repeat entanglement. So now she is on to bigger and better things. The Crib Shield System would make a great gift for exspecting parents. One less thing to worry about. One you probably never even though of; but baby will.
B009Z4VMMM|5|Loved the color options. The pad and tray are not essential in order to use the high chair but a fun way to personalize!
B005APW7CO|5|Your kid will fit just fine: my son is 17 months old, 34&#34; tall, and 29 lbs., which puts him over the 95th percentile. We just expanded the seating area for the first time, to give him a little more tummy room.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />* At first the mechanism to lower the tray seemed a little awkward, but it became second nature after a couple of weeks.<br />* Setting it up was a snap.<br />* The straps are useless and obviously only there to meet a government mandate.<br />* It's trivially easy to clean.<br />* Our kitchen is small, and for a while we folded up the chair after every use: it's impressively small. We no longer do that, and I suspect that you won't, either, unless you don't use it on a daily basis.<br />* It looks great.
B0009RNXNA|1|Please note the other reviews for this product are old! We ordered this bag and literally, as soon as we opened it and unzipped it, it broke. The zipper does not work, and the padding was damaged. This product is of awful quality. Find another car seat bag as this one is terrible.
B004KT5VGA|3|Cheap toy, not a good brand!
B0000663Q2|4|I have 3 month old twins and a 3 year old and this stroller has been great.  It's the only reasonably priced double stroller that can hold two infant car seats (it comes with one, you have to buy the other)which right away makes it stand out.  It steers very well and folds and unfolds easily.  Although this is strictly against the stroller guidelines, the cup holder area is big enough for my 3 year old to sit on and hold on to me while I push.  If you've got twin babies and a preschooler or toddler, this is a lifesaver.  Also, I read here that the infant seat that comes with it has only a 3-point harness but mine has a 5-point harness.<br />Nothings perfect though and here are the biggest negatives:<BR>*The storage basket is very difficult to access if you have both car seats in the stroller or if the back seat is reclined.<BR>*The wheels squeak way to loudly<BR>*The latch for holding it together when folded is weak and not easy to use.<BR>*Bulky, fits in the back of my mini-van but takes up most of the trunk space.
B003I7K2I2|5|Besides being very bulky, it's great for two kiddos, very sleek looking, too.  We first got it when our youngest was an infant and in the Graco carrier, which despite other reviews, definitely fits perfectly into the back or front seat positions.  But now both boys can sit in it comfortably.  Both seats recline for naps and I like the storage areas.  Double strollers are more common, but people still make comments when we pass that they like it (and maybe need to get one).
B000WJSABU|2|This item suppose to fit 3T-4T kids, but made rather for pretty full sized 5-6 year old. The quality is not all that great either. There is no way my daughter will be able to wear it even at 6 since she is very slim.  Total waist of money.
B00527TSOU|4|I purchase this item for my sister so she could give it to her daughter for Mothers day!  Her daughter (my Niece) is expecting her first child and loves horses.  The Horse Playtivity Blankee looked just like the pictures and I know she will love it.  Was not thrilled with the packaging - it was wrapped loosely in brown paper and put in at envelope!
B005PK1D7E|1|HA!!!! I loved this idea so much I ordered 4 of them! Of course I only got 2! However, they don't work! The cups stick in them so every time you pull your drink out the whole thing comes out and spills on you! GRRRRRR I want a refund but no one seems to get my correspondence!!!
B0029V5MLU|1|It matches to room decor, but it stopped working in less than 30 days!  The music plays for too little time.  I don't recommend it at all, really disappointing.
B004QIVQCI|1|The pillow is not thick enough to place on your lap and have the baby/babies high enough to nurse.  The cover is attached by velcro - not a zipper.  I would think over time this would be a pain to put back on after washing.  In addition, the cover only provides privacy from the front.  My whole breast is exposed from any other angle.  There is not enough coverage on the side.      The pillow is soft, and a good idea - just not well developed.  Don't waste your money.
B0043C5XYY|4|I used disposable pads for the first 6 months to handle heavy leaking, and have only minor leaking to control now.<br /><br />These do seem to be of good quality but as other reviewers have stated, they do tend to shift a bit, sometimes poking out of the top of my bra. I have noticed that it really makes a difference what kind of bra I'm wearing; I have more of a problem with bras that have molded cups, since they aren't as tight to hold things in place. If only the outer fabric wasn't as slick I don't think it would be as much of a problem. My other issue is that when I do have a small amount of leakage, the pad stays wet--there is no wicking action in the fabric, so wetness will stay wet and you need to change it as soon as possible. This is a little inconvenient when wearing these and nursing outside the house. I used a different brand in the past that had microfleece that allowed me to stay dry even after leaking a small amount.<br /><br />My favorite thing about these pads, however is that they do not show through my bra and shirt, due to the design and fabric. I have had other pads that looked like giant pancakes and these are a big improvement.
B003G2YUU0|5|I'm so in love with this mobile it's so beautiful ! And looks great in my baby's crib ! I look forward when my baby gets here !
B000S9RF4M|5|my grandson loved this gift from me, its the only toy his mom says he plays with he's only 7mths old.... So thanks alot amazon this made my grandson's 1st Christmas beautiful for me...
B0088N4ASE|4|Love it! It's more beige than white but I still love it. Have gotten it monogrammed already && ready to go! Seems very durable.
B004BSFC46|1|One is a rattle the other is crinkly. The rattle you can barely hear, it sound so soft that my baby doesn't even notice that it's there because she can't hear it moving. I was disappointed
B006JFTS6M|5|Love this little train spoon! It is so adorable and has been very helpful in teaching our little guy how to self-feed. The train portion of the spoon is a hard stop, so he can't force the spoon to far deep into his little mouth!
B002USCD2S|5|I just received the bear today but it's already soft & squishy - like it's been loved on for quite some time. It perfectly coordinates w/ the Haylie bedding, as I expected. I had planned for it to sit on a shelf as decor but it's soft enough for her to actually use and play with. Very pleased w/ the purchase!    Tags on bear specifically say not to immerse in water or machine wash. Spot clean only.
B001OC5UNA|5|Works great but opening is a bit narrow, especially if you're carrying a baby though it. Of our six cats, only one can jump over it.
B000P24D92|5|Perfect size for a 3 year old to stand on to pee into the toilet.
B0002RNPLM|5|I chose this set because I love moons and stars, but also because it is neutral and pretty at the same time.  It has cute, soft baby colors, and it's very friendly.  Compared to other bedding sets, it's also a good price.  I love the blanket especially! It's so beautiful, and I think it would match any crib (I have a dark one and it looks nice).  It has good quality, and I plan to use it with our next child--and it will go well, no matter what its gender! I really recommend the set!
B00A3DEQFY|5|Good Product.
B0091BZULS|5|A+A muslin washcloths are the only ones we use on our baby. I especially like the larger size of these vs. others in their product line. Super soft and love the material.
B00IT4E6QS|4|Great  for the Dark Hole between seats and console... just wish it was little long beyond the opening for the seat-belt, toward the back of the seat.  I have a large seat in my truck and it does not cover the completed opening.
B002XB0NU6|2|While \\"cute\\" looking it doesn't serve much of any other purpose. You only get a couple seconds of play out of winding it. Ended up buying a different brand that was actually functional and not just for looks.
B002VWRPZ8|5|I have received several Lamaze toys for my children in past years and decided to buy this one for my six month old's first Christmas. She loved it! I was also very happy to find it was easy for her to chew on the sea horse, and I was also very happy to find the the mermaid tale is a mirror which I could not tell from the picture. Amazon even got it to us earlier then predicted.
B0050GD2EA|5|Everything is perfect in Amazon!!!!
B002C30S96|3|Little too small...it's for a preschooler, so small is in order, but none of my preschoolers library books fit inside, zipped.
B0029QMU42|5|SO CUTE! LOVE IT
B000N8QWS8|4|I gave this as a birthday present to my granddaughter... girls like blocks too.  She is really enjoying them, and her mother sends me text messages of her playing with them.
B001OC5UNA|5|Easy to set up and works great; however, a plus size home owner may find the opening a bit tight. The pass through space is somewhat narrow.
B00SBSPCSS|5|Bought the pink one for my nieces! They absolutely love spending the night and turning on &#34;the stars&#34; before they go to bed. Love that it automatically turns itself off! Great product! Plus, it's cute! :)<br /><br />I received the turtle at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review
B004EWGDCE|4|lightweight and easy to install. The suction cups work well too. Great way to keep your bath area organized with all the toys the kids can bring into their bath
B006HNRRTQ|2|Smaller than advertised. Actual dimensions of block are 1.4&#34;x1.4&#34;x1.4&#34;. Picture is misleading as well.
B00GTBNUEC|1|This necklace is cute, but that's about it. I was hoping it would help w baby's reflux, but it was too rough on his skin for him to wear it very long! The wood pieces are rough and the ends are almost sharp. They need to smooth at least the edges of the wood beads, if they can't sand down the pieces themselves to be smoother. It made baby's skin around his neck so red and scratched that I couldn't bear for him to wear it more than a couple times. Babies have soft skin, and as much as these necklaces get stuck in their little neck folds, you really don't want something this rough and sharp digging around in there.<br />And no, it didn't help the reflux.
B0028H3ACS|5|Received these WubbaNub pacifiers very quickly and they are so cute and adorable !  They were the last pacifier one of my granddaughters would take and she is adorable holding on to them !
B000A6OLM2|5|My daughter is 6 months. This is the best product I have invested in for her. It's well pricedfor how great it works! I make baby food from scratch and do it all with this food mill. I highly recommend it.
B0027KU8Z8|4|Very cute, i bought Bc it matches the set. Seems very simple to put together. May not Be the best but it will do. I would buy it again.
B00KAXSV94|5|Very sturdy and easy to clean.
B001L21EQK|5|This hamper is adorable. Holds plenty of dirty laundry and even with my sons cloths in there, its lightweight! Easy to carry to and from the laundry room. I love how it can fold easily and perfect to store! I got this for my newborn son.
B0034JHDHM|4|my daughter's cradle cap is pretty bad but this seems to clear it up for a bit when it is used.  Wish I could say it rid her of the cradle cap altogether but having eczema is not helping
B00CELZLB6|5|He is adorable.
B0000DH5TU|2|I returned this product after trying it for a week due to the difficult on/off dial on the receivers.  The dial barely sticks up off of the device enough to get a grip on it, and there isn't even an edge that you could use your fingernail to turn it with.  I knew that if I couldn't turn it on easily, my husband definitely couldn't with his larger fingers.  The last thing I need is for him to have an excuse not to watch the baby.
B007D1SHUY|4|I find these not only usefull for her bottle nipples and pacifiers but also to dry ziploc bags.  It also helps create more space on the boon grass for other items.<br /><br />Recommend? Definitely
B005DEWE16|4|Used this for my first and second. Not the easiest to clean when they learn to stuff food in the cracks, but does the job. Easier to wipe down than the one my mother in law has with the fabric cover that has to be washed every time the kid eats.
B00074FY9Q|5|As PPs have stated, this feeder is in 3 separate  pieces for \\"easy\\" cleaning. The BSF is very durable feeling and the plastic bits are easy to rinse off and throw in the dishwasher. It is a bit heavy, but not excessivley so. The mesh pouch also seems durable and is not as difficult to clean as other similar products. I soak mine in hot water for 15 or so minutes then finger rub the debris off/out before machine washing it. There are seams along the inside and at the ring of the pouch and most debris seems to get caught in the seam allowance. It is easy for baby to grasp and hold and the trouble it takes to clean it is well worth the enjoyment he gets from it. I highly recommend this product over similar ones.
B004AHMCKA|5|He loves it so much we purchased 3! One for our house, the diaper bag for eating out and my parents house (my mom is daycare.) He is literally obsessed with wheels and this keeps his attention. He also loves to try and unstick it. It holds extremely well as my son is super strong and we haven't had a problem!
B006QH43IQ|5|This is a great stroller.  I wish I had thought of buying one from day one.  Our daughter loves it, it is so light and easy to fold that we even took it to Disneyland, just mommy and girl without breaking a sweat when going in and out the trams.  And it is beautiful and nice for a fast walk/stroller ride at the park even though this one doesn't have the rubber wheels.
B001L2SA6M|5|perfect
B0009OLSZ8|5|I wanted a small potty chair that would be easy for our 18 month old to sit on. We didn't pressure her to use it, but would casually ask. She would run in and sit on it, read on it, and sing songs. Fast forward to when she is 22 months and she now asks to go potty and will actually use it for that purpose!  Still in the potty training process, but this is a great starter tool.  I specifically got the white with splash guard so that it was the same color as the adult toilet in all the bathrooms and also so we could see if she went.
B002BIFGQ2|4|This is a great crib. We bought two for our daughters who are 17 months apart. Our older daughter (she'll be two soon) has loved it and the mattress lowers enough that she can't climb out.<br />However, the only reason this crib isn't 5 stars is because recently, our older daughter has taken to putting her let through the slats and her knee gets stuck. It's not something that just happens; she has to purposely put her leg in it. But once she does, her leg is stuck really good until my husband and I help her, by pulling the slats apart! It seems a bit unsafe for me. The manufacturer should really make them just a little closer together.<br />Otherwise, a GREAT crib for a GREAT price! Like I said...we bought two! :-D
B0035ER58I|3|You'll notice a difference for a couple of days, but not much lasting difference. I mostly threw them in the bottom of the diaper pail after realizing they didn't do much in the nursery as a whole and didn't see any difference in there, but that's probably asking too much of this little product. As others have mentioned, it's also a huge bummer that once the pack is open, they are all open so you basically have to use them all right away.
B000JJK9EY|5|This thing is sturdy.  It survived it's first trip to Florida this summer.Just need to readjust the car seat after the plane people throws them when gate checking.  Very nice for traveling with toddler. Very well recommended.
B003B1ZYAQ|5|I have four kids and just discovered these burp cloths. My baby is 2 months old and she is my second \\"spitter.\\"  I had a favorite before these, but these are so much better.  They are soft on baby's skin, lightweight so I don't feel like I\\"m wearing a diaper on my shoulder, and most importantly, absorbent.  Since my baby spits up so much, I don't expect to use one burp cloth for the whole day.  It lasts 2-3 feedings and then launders perfectly.  Some burp cloths are easy to maneuver on the shoulder, but only last one feeding.  Others are actually huge diapers and would last all day, but be totally gross and stinky.  This one is a perfect middle ground.
B00I2OBMA8|5|It came in all its Cobalt glory true to image. LOVE IT.<br />Love the material and storage space, in fact, it's spacious without being overly bulky plus it's easy to access your belongings if you organise well. The soft and light-coloured lining is also great for easy cleaning and also makes it much more visible to search for stuff. The set items that came with it works fine too and looks true to image.<br />My main concern prior to getting this was the zips' issue that some user did highlight (though not a major problem), but so far, mine seems to work fine for now and doesn't look like it'll wear or give me problems (anytime soon at least).<br /><br />If you don't overpack or load it up with unnecessary bulky items, it's pretty comfy to carry too.<br /><br />Definitely a stylish and versatile diaper bag that can double up as your leisure/work bag. I'd recommend this if you're into a stylish non-diaper-ish looking bag which serves your basic needs in style.
B0035ER8LM|5|This bed is perfect for a child care home with a limited amount of space. But it still presents a professional look to my Day Care that is very affordable. I love them.
B0033UWT8A|4|These hooks come in grey color and not as shown on the picture.<br />Apart from that the product is good,however the maximum weight limit is not shown on the cover-that would be desireable!
B001831AGG|5|This giraffe is totally adorable!  It brightens up the whole nursery and it is such a big, fun toy!  We were so excited to get it and add it to our little ones home!  It is very durable and very bright and cheery!  We recommend!
B0096MLKES|5|Perfect addition to the graco pack n play system. Adds a great deal more comfort to the flooring. Good product.
B00ISS2S6A|4|We've been in need of a replacement car seat, as our current one for our 2 1/2 year old is set to expire in August. We'd previously had an Eddie Bauer car seat, which she'd been using for sometime. It's been great, but it's nearly 5 year old age is showing. Fabric is fraying, etc.<br /><br />This one came along, and we'd never heard of the brand, Diono. My wife, as a result, was somewhat concerned. Checking other car seats by the manufacturer, however, were very positive. Most had 4 1/2 stars with over a thousand reviews. You don't see that very often on Amazon unless the product is good.<br /><br />Once it was received, the first thing my wife commented on was how heavy the box was. Later in the day, took it out of the box. It is quite heavy. Although they market it as being able to be very easy to fold up, etc. I'm not sure I'd want to lug around such a heavy car seat. I guess people do, however.<br /><br />Unpacking was pretty straightforward. I slid it out of the box. Everything was packed nicely. Some straps were folded up and secured with rubber bands, while others were with the zip ties you can purchase. It was, as a result, quite easy to unpack.<br /><br />Since the car seat comes folded up, I had to figured out how to unfold it. The manual had about 5 easy steps that helped me to do. I then followed the instructions for setting it up for my 2 1/2 year old. Literally, in 10 minutes, I had this thing unpacked and ready for install in our minivan.<br /><br />The next morning, I embarked on the task of installing the car seat. After removing the old Eddie Bauer seat, I placed the new Diono one in the same spot. Literally 5 minutes later, I had it installed. It was a bit more loose then I'd like, especially considering that I'd installed it with the latch system. I did also utilize the top anchor that goes around to the back of the seat for additional support.<br /><br />After further inspection, I noticed the latch belt was twisted. I was able to simply detach the latches with the convenient buttons they have built-in. I adjusted the belt, and snapped it back on the latch. Tightened the belt further, and it was as tight as I wanted. Right now we have it front-facing, but I suspect rear-facing would be just as simple.<br /><br />The cup holder solution is pretty slick. It has this built-in rod that you slide into a hole in the car seat. The fabric is cut to have a hole just the right size for the rod. Slide it in, and it snaps just fine.<br /><br />My 2 1/2 year old loves sitting in her &#34;new seat.&#34; We're happy so far too. Nice to have a seat that will last 12 years.the latches with the convenient buttons they have built-in. I adjusted the belt, and snapped it back on the latch.

B004IYNG8C|5|I was undecided on buying this, until two different friends who also have a Vista showed me how their strollers were broken by airlines. One had the footrest broken, the other had the handle broken. It folds neatly and relatively compactly, so you can toss it in the stroller basket (with extra room to spare) while walking through the airport. It has wheels, so it's easy to pull along. And it protects the stroller from all stains and rips. The real value in this, though, is the guarantee it comes with. The closing latch on our stroller was affected during a flight, and Uppababy sent us a brand new stroller frame, with NO HASSLE. If you've already invested in an expensive stroller like the Vista, spending $80 to protect it is a no-brainer.
B000ME3146|5|I have had the same Ameda Purely Yours since my first son was born in 2011. I am in the military so I have had to pump at least 3 times a day while working in buildings, and about 6 times a day when I was out in the field. I nursed my first son for 9 months and I am 7 months in on my second son now and going strong. The pump has traveled and worked steadily from Texas all the way up to Alaska.<br /><br /> I am writing this review now because I just went through 2 weeks of training in Alaska at temperatures as low as -20 while having to carry my Ameda, accessories and expressed milk with me for up to several days at a time, all outdoors. Through everything, the Ameda worked just fine, no issues. It has always been easy to clean and has been a champ at getting all of my milk out. The only caveat I have is that when it gets too cold (below 50 degrees) the mechanisms slow down so I would have to warm the pump and batteries next to my body before use, but I would not have been able to do the same with the Medela since it is so bulky.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a pump. It is a tremendous value for the price, very flexible and extremely durable. I am still using it at work now that I am back and you would never know that it traveled all through the backcountry in a rucksack!
B00021RGBI|5|If you like the book, you will love these....very cute.  They make my baby's room cuddly and warm.  I was looking for something like this and it is perfect.
B0034G61DC|5|This is by far - one of the best baby purchases I have made.  My little one loves it!!  Full of bright colors, different textures and cozy for playtime!!
B003N49ML8|1|This is just a terrible design.  Here are the problems:    1) The flexible plastic straw unit on top is VERY HARD to seat correctly after you remove it for cleaning.  Even the slightest flaw in seating it will cause a leak if the cup is inverted.  If the seating of the top is not absolutely perfect, \\"clicking\\" the top does not insure that it's sealed.    2) The flexible plastic straw unit on top of the cup can be easily pushed in by a toddler's finger.  If that happens, the seal is broken and the cup leaks.    3) The top part of the straw has some kind of valve that makes it impossible to run water through it.  How are you supposed to clean this thing if you cannot run water through it?    4) This cup has no mechanism to conceal the straw for travel.  This means that unlike other straw cups, you cannot simply throw this into a bag and go.  Because the straw is always exposed, it will collect dirt.  So you need to put it in a ziplok or something.  Why?  Why?  Why?    Just a bad, bad design all around.
B0042D6CI0|5|My toddler (14 months old) loves this stool.  Although he is too young to use it for it's intended purpose, he loves to press the button and listen to the songs.
B0074JKQ0Y|5|Love, love, love this car seat transporter! I purchased this for my trip to Disney February 2015 and I breezed through the airport. I received so many stares and compliments and people asking me where I got it. It is easy to attach to a large car seat as I have the Chicco a Next Fit, and you just pop open the wheels, loop the straps around the car seat and pull the handle up and you're on your way. So glad I got this. They didn't even make me remove it while it went through the security scanners like others mentioned. However, we were fine with reattaching it as we just needed to get our baby's car seat and the baby on move.
B00AXQ11JK|4|It fits perfectly in my Cuisinart Baby food maker.  I love that I can store my food in it and also use the same containers to warm  up the baby food in the Baby food maker.  They're the perfect portion size for my 6 month old.
B003Z6AOAW|5|I love this product. It is absolutely the best invention by a mother I have come across. I wish I would have known about it or it was around when my oldest daughter was born. I saw this product on Amazon and knew I had to have it for my baby. She's the youngest of four, so I knew it would come in handy. And it has saved me more ways than I can count. I love it. I recommend this product to any mom or dad whether it's your first baby or your fourth like mine. Also, everywhere I go I get comments on it, whether it's in Walmart or the mall. They always ask where I got it from and I always tell them. My brother even said he wished he knew of it when his youngest was born. Thank you for inventing an outstanding product.
B0017W5VTU|5|I was so excited when I saw this border because it was the theme I was going for and the bonus was that it did not have the traditional wall paper paste application. When it arrived I couldn't wait to put it up. It looked awesome!!! and was soooo easy. I also purchased the Trend Lab Retro Transportation Window Valance and fire truck toddler beds (the plastic one). The room turned out great for my toddler!!!
B004EHL85G|5|When will you have more of these. I had one for my first daughter and i loved it now im expecting in febuary and want one so bad but its still unavailable. Plz get more in
B00UEY2DXO|5|This came just in time. My son is currently cutting teeth and I really think this is helping I see a lot less drool. Bonus is it looks super cute on him!
B000JQ2AMQ|5|We tried this cover and the Jeep brand for our Schwinn. This one did the trick. We took it on its maiden voyage tonight. I thought it was easy to put on; just three quick velcros on each side. There is a bit of a gap over the front wheel, but the blanket we put over our daughter's leg easily plugged to hole. I was able to sneak my hand in the side fairly easily to adjust her hat or give her a toy. So far I'm pleased with it for the price. I'll try to remember to review again after we've used it more.
B006ZVV0P2|5|So far the kick mats have worked well.  I feel they will continue to do so.  Great Product!!
B00440CZYG|5|I like the size & you can really keep ahold of it. Baby likes the colors & relates it to eating time.
B00D4XF686|4|Goes well in my Guest Room
B000U5FOT2|5|This gate has been great for our twins.  We had to get two of them to create a large enough space, but it is sturdy and safe.
B000FRBCJG|5|These baskets are really nice & sturdy.  They are for my my new grand babies nursery.  Very nice.  The 3 different sizes were perfect.  I ordered a second set for her closet shelves.  Great price, very good product.
B003YH5470|1|I purchased these hoping to acquire 400 corks for a project. Surprising ordering 4x didn't get me the amount expected plus, there were 2-3 in each bag that were broken pieces without its other half. Majority of these are from the same brand so if you're looking for variety then this is not the purchase for you. Bummed.
B000XT30G4|5|This gate works exactly as you would hope. It is easy to set-up, easy to use and keeps our Rottweiler out of a room.
B008818PCI|1|I was very excited to get this product for my daughter, who has been teething. She loved it, but after ONE day, the mouth shield cracked. I obviously can't have her use it now since the shield can no longer serve its purpose. I thought I was doing the right thing by buying a green, sustainable product, but it turns out to be very low quality.
B003OUWIK8|5|This is our second Britax car seat, and we got it for our other car.  The first one we got was the Boulevard.  We are very happy with both of them.  The Marathon is extremely sturdy, and very simple to install using the LATCH.  If you've done it before, you can have it out of the box and installed in under 10 minute.  The Marathon also makes it very easy to adjust the shoulder strap height and snugness.  It's a little bit of a pain on the Boulevard.  I am very happy with this car seat and we will definitely continue to buy Britax in the future.
B0090OM1F4|5|Good size for younger babies.  The flower is very cute.
B00A6B05XK|5|My grand daughters love them!
B00AWJHCDW|3|I was pleased to find these. In addition to being cute, it is a great way to feed my baby homemade baby food. She has feeding issues ...very picky and learning to tolerate eating from a spoon. She will tolerate much more without gagging if it comes from the pouches.<br /><br />It's nice to have a reuseable product. However, this one is difficult to clean. I've been using bottle brushes to hand wash them but still rather tricky to get into the crevices. The other downside is that the plastic stains easily. It stained orange yellow from one of her purees and even after multiple washes the color does not come out. It appears that it is permanently stained.
B000XT30G4|5|Gate was easy to install(pressure mount) is sturdy for kids and dog. The gate open closes with ease. Highly recommend.
B000VWLMH2|5|Brilliant Bear for a great price we were very happy with it and the service . Thank you so much .!! Our daughter loved it !!
B005XRV69E|5|these are the cutest sheets for a little baby boys crib. the color blue is so pretty and the animals are a perfect baby size
B004V3GG2S|5|It was everything that I was looking for..
B0087W85AU|5|Very good color, craftsmanship and price. Highly recommend this quality head wrap.
B004Y3DX8A|3|Perfect shipping, packaging etc. I bough refurnished from Amazon and dont regret.<br />Therefore, the product itself was disappointing. The color is ugly (I already knew, but didnt want to pay extra money only for color), and its kinda of difficult to drive it using the handler while your child cant do it by herself. I think other similar products from cheaper brands would do the job. I probably should sent it back.
B000CSBPCW|4|The spoon bowl is on the big side of things, but the handle is just right for my 14 month old.  They are playful, but not too distracting like other spoons on the market.
B00BH0QNQ2|4|Great product!!
B00CMC67Z6|5|Our daughter's room colors we chose are gray and pink...these stickers match perfectly and look so cute with just a plain white onesie on.  I really like the quality of the sticker too, it feels almost like a thin vinyl rather than paper.  It would definitely peel off a shirt and stick to something else.  Super cute in pictures that we'll keep for years to come.
B002WB2GA2|4|I bought this stroller for my mom to use because she keeps my daughter every day.  It's not as good as my UppaBaby G-Luxe umbrella stroller, but it's the best deal out there for the price, no doubt.
B000B7MBVS|5|Although the hippopotamus is my daughters favorite, there isn't a toy here she doesn't like. Highly recommended! We have tons of fun!
B006JFTRQ8|5|Very well made love the product
B000RN1WPM|3|The onesie body suit is cute but the imprint is not bright it is as washed out as it looks on line. Sandra
B007RF98ZE|5|The quality , design,. size, color is very good.<br /><br /> I like it! and My son also likes.<br /><br />There are many advantages to sunglasses.
B007CTPWXW|5|Although it does not fit fully across the width of a double stroller, it is strong and holds stuff well.  Only thing I would change is to add a zipper part and not just a magnet.  Although, the magnet part is nice to just throw the keys in and it stays shut.
B00TVDBQ3C|5|Works great. Fit our Outback seats perfectly.
B00EPFH7DY|5|An ingenious product. I love the way that all the OXO Tot lids are interchangeable too! So I can put a sippy cup lid on this as well. PLUS the plastic piece that slows the flow of the liquid comes out...so that eventually when she gets better at drinking we can use these as &#34;real&#34; cups!
B001KC08UE|5|Perfect fit to my Simmons Beauty Rest Changing pad
B005GU17G0|4|Bought this after my daughter started to get bored with her walker. She seems to have a blast in this thing. Since we first started putting her in it, she's really gotten the hang of navigating around the room. She did catch her feet under the outer frame once or twice, which made her cry but didn't seem to actually injure her or anything. Otherwise, a great product.
B0053YP9EK|3|These towels are OK--kind of thin and scratchy but OK if that's what you have. Now I use them to line the tub while my son is taking a bath to prevent slippage. I actually use the washcloths more than the towels!
B0040Z3YD6|5|This is very cute and practical to help with modesty while breast feeding.
B001WAJVZM|5|Does exactly what you would expect it to!  My son loved it as soon as we attached it to our bathtub faucet!
B002S0NRCI|2|Bought this to match the other sadly VERY overpriced cottontale bits for our nursery. This is an overpriced bath mat really,and it just slides around on the carpet. YUK.
B00IN8OI72|2|I wasn't aware the straw was its own valve. My baby would have to suck through the straw in a very specific way for the liquid to come up the straw. This will not be used.
B00B0XT3A4|5|These are great! They fit well and hang over the front and sides long enough so nothing touches the toilet (clothes, hands, etc.). I will be buying these again!
B00J7KU3LA|4|I always was disgusted by the thought of sucking the snot with my mouth with fear that I would suck something up,but my son was very congested so I thought I'd give it a try since the bulb sucker was useless! This does get out a ton more than the bulb syringe but if you don't put the small piece of tissue in it as recommended on the package you will feel moisture suck into your mouth. I never got any snot sucked in my mouth but just the moisture makes me think I've sucked in something gross and its a little nasty to think about.  The company has amazing customer service though,I received an email from them before I even received the product.  My son hates anything being put into his nose but this does help a lot, esp if you use saline drops to loosen up the boogers first.
B002UD65R2|5|Very soft, fits well
B0028K2RME|5|I ordered the Fisher Price Precious Planet Kick & Play for my 5 month old nephew.  My daughters had one when they were little and my 3 year old still isn't willing to part with hers.  Now that he is getting really into kicking, we thought it would be perfect fun for him.  And we were right - he loves it!  Great product, super delivery time - thanks so much!
B008U4MKU6|5|I have 4-month-old twins who are too small for our double stroller, so I got this double stroller frame. It has made trips around town so much easier. It fits very well in the back of my car (2005 Pontiac Vibe). It accommodates a Graco Snugride 30 and an Evenflo Nurture very well, though the Evenflo's fit is awkward.<br /><br />The only real drawback is accessing things in the bottom basket when both seats are on the frame. I usually keep the diaper bag down there, and it can be much easier to extract individual items from the bag than to take the bag out. Putting groceries in the bottom can be awkward. Unfolding it can be tricky.
B004GCJMO8|4|I liked this -- super simple and does the job. We have a wall mounted tv, and a shelf about 10 inches below with the cable box. This allowed me to hide all the cables, and do it in about 5 seconds. Our walls are concrete, so no going behind the wall. Even my dad - generally a stickler for perfect work - thought the results looked good.
B001MS83OE|5|This has made changing our son so much easier! Out of all the baby gear i have purchased i think i have used this the most. It helps keep him from sliding around when getting changed and its nice and comfy. Easy to clean.
B0000899O3|4|If you can, buy the double pump. My doctor said it helps in 2 ways, takes half the time and it can even \\"trick\\" your body into thinking you have twins, thus making more milk.    I didnt purchase the double pump due to the price. However, this mid-grade pump is just dandy for the amount of milk it can pump out in the time it takes. It makes for an easy and quick let down and the speed dial lets you choose how much suction you can handle.    Dont get discuraged! The first time I used it it seem to work amazing! I got out 2 ounces in no time flat then the next time I used it it took me using it over and over throughout the entire day to barely reach the 2 ounce mark. I had also read another review that mentioned this: worked great the first time, then didnt work hardly at all the following times.... But dont get discouraged if this happens, it took my body some time to get used to breastfeeding and pumping. Not to mention, it always worked best for me in the morning- OR- if you are really dedicated, use it during the night inbetween your baby's longest period of sleep... you will get a lot more than when you pump after (even if its the morning) feeding your baby.    I would have given this pump 5 stars but because sometimes the pump hurts my nipples. I dont have any comparisons but my doctor said when she used the Medela manual pump, it hurt her too.      I would recommend this pump and its sister, the Easy Comfort Double Pump.    NOTE: Please keep in mind how long you plan on breastfeeding tho. I wanted to keep breastfeeding for 6months so this would be a good investment but once my dr said I needed to supplement I ended up giving up breastfeeding just before 4months. I didnt get to use it as much as I would have liked, considering the money I spent on it. So, if you want a pump, consider this: renting one from your hospital. They ususally run about $30/month and you will get one that, if you were to buy it out-right, it would cost you $1,500. I wish I had done this instead.
B00G9FP9QU|5|Very good quality and very handy!
B002TOKHLM|5|When my mom told me about these I immediatly looked them up and found that these was a reasonable price. I use these for my daycare kids that have trouble with the spoon in the beginning.
B006V84ME0|5|My baby just knows how to drink from this bottle. Save me the effort to teach. I even watched the video online about how to teach baby to use straw cup.
B002AQW6WM|3|Love these fun bath toys..my daughter loves reading all the eric carle books so of course we had to have these!
B000056HNX|4|I like this bottle becouse it is easy to clean,and does not have a lot of parts to it!The one bad thing is for what ever reason once in a while the bottle leaks!!! You do not know it till you have soaked the baby which means you need to change the little one AGAIN.
B00T8VQ4AW|3|I like the old familiar tunes that are played. I also like that it's very bright and colorful. However, it is very cheaply made so it wasn't worth this price. Also, the motor on it is a little loud. The toys hang down low, so my five month old can already touch them by reaching up from his stomach.
B0001IU5HY|5|This has been the nicest swing.  I also used a Graco and when the baby got tired his head slumped to the side and hit the support bar when the swing was going back and forth.  This one cradles his head beautifully (and that hair rubbing off issue that has been mentioned is something that happens to a lot of babies at 3 months or so - Jack's hair rubbed off in the crib as he moved his head and most of the rest fell out, but at maybe 5 months it grew back.  The swing didn't do it to him).  He sleeps so well in this, so I can shower or do other work.  Now that he's 21 lbs the swing motor has to work harder - the front to back swing position works better than side to side because his heavy head can slow the swinging if it's to one side.  He has grabbed the animals so many times really hard and has never broken the mechanism (you can turn the mobile off so that it is out of baby's reach).  It is true that no matter how wide you push the legs, one seems to lift a tiny bit when it swings (on hardwood floor), but I don't put it above 2 speed.  The Graco also seemed to have only a very fast swing that did not relax him, whereas this Papasan is perfect.  He loves the mirror as well.  I attach toys to the tray to give him more to play with.
B00H4E9WLI|5|We have had this product a little over a week and my son has already started sitting up by himself for short periods of time.  He also tries to sit up in the car seat now when we're trying to strap him in...  I'm glad that I found this product, this is definitely helping to strengthen his back muscles.  I'm a happy customer.
B0097GUCZ6|5|I am a 34 F right now and was wondering how this could be a \\"one size fits most\\". It is! The adjustable strap in the back will allow many sizes to use it. It is comfortable and easy to use. Although, the product is pink.. What about a nude color or white? Overall, great product and cheaper than those made by the breast pumping companies.
B00AHO43BG|3|So cute
B00895H9HU|5|I am currently using a car seat and it fits well to shield against wind and rain to make it comfortable with my little one and also works even with the car seat covers that I have on it.  The picture on the box is misleading because that is not the City Versa but everything else checked off looks right.  I have not tried it on the actual Versa seat yet but hope to do so soon!
B0073KGFE0|5|I really like the fast flow nipples. It was taking my son forever to finish 5 ounces and now its all in his suckle. At first he couldn't keep up with the flow but after about a week he's now fine and has no problems.  I'm really satisfied with all my born free products. Love the ventilated bottle system...would recommend this product anytime.
B002EL3T8I|1|These mats came apart immediately as soon as I walked on them. I have had to push them together several times a day. I would not waste my money again on this product. I have already gone ahead to buy something else.
B000I2Q0F4|5|Baby LOVED IT.
B005IWM74C|4|This item was purchased as a shower gift. The &#34;showeree&#34; seemed very excited to receive this product. She expressed many new mothers commented on the usage for their babies.
B002ZDFVP4|5|This rail is just what we hoped it would be - well made, light, non obstructive and allows room for our daughter to climb in and out - we own a pottery barn kids 3 in 1 crib - took down one side and put in this rail. It's great!
B007FRJQ5G|4|The product is good but my son don`t like to sleep on it because he finds it way too small.
B005CV4D8C|5|excelente 100% recomendado al publico en general
B00FQM0OCQ|4|This is a very nice projector light. This light projects stars and a moon on to your ceiling. It is bright enough to be seen on the ceiling but not too bright to where it will keep the baby or child awake. It changes between 3 colors including red, blue, and green which makes it even more fun. Would be great in a nursery or as a baby shower gift.<br /><br />It is very simple to use just plug it in to your wall outlet and then use the three buttons on the front. The first button turns it on, the second button changes the color, and the third button plays music. I personally love the light but don't care for the music. The music is honestly just too loud forceful in my opinion and I can't see a baby being able to sleep listening to that. With that being said I still love the light just not the music.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B002KRDFS0|5|Great night love and the kids just love it!  It changes colours and has a longer timer on it than most other night lights.  We used to use the Mobi night lights, and this one is far better.
B005G3QSF2|4|This is a comprehensive review of the Kiinde Kozii and the Born Free Tru-Temp Bottle Warming Systems:<br />Why those two? As new parents, it can be a daunting task in picking out all of the different things babies require. It can be quite overwhelming. We rely on these types of reviews that lay out exactly what we need and exactly what we want. A bottle warmer is one of those things that you will want as a new parent. Sure, it wasn't that long ago when your parents were boiling water on the stove and placing their bottle inside, but a bottle warmer can be quicker, can be safer, and can be easier, which comes into handy at 3 o'clock in the morning. I purchased both of these bottle warmers from Amazon, first the Born Free and then the Kiinde Kozii, they seemed to be the most popular, and the most expensive, so they must be good right? Something you can depend on, something that will get the job done that you won't have to worry about.<br />This review compares these two popular items based on many of the desired attributes one is looking for in a bottle warmer.<br /><br />Heating Capability: Kozii: 4/5 Born Free: 3/5<br />We switched from the Born Free to the Kozii bottle warmer, the whole reason for this was due to the heating capability of the Born Free. Although it heats the water to a boiling temperature, which might heat your bottle faster than the Kozii (which still heats the water pretty hot just not boiling), the water level of the Born Free only reaches up about a half an inch up the bottle where as the Kozii runs water nearly three inches up the bottle. We purchased the popular Playtex Vent Aire bottles, but on these the bottom half inch is a thick plastic that allows for air to flow in and out. As the Born Free only heated up this portion of the bottle the milk itself never got warm. This obviously was a huge issue. I only gave the Kozii 4/5 as it still seems to take longer than I would expect to heat four ounces of milk, about 9 minutes. Both bottle warmers are capable of containing any type of bottle or storage bag. The Born Free bottle warmer does have a setting for refrigerated milk or luke warm milk, where the Kozii does not.<br /><br />Display: Kozii: 2/5 Born Free: 4/5<br />I'm not a huge fan of the Kozii display, it's simply a timer, nothing else to it. The Born Free has a light up display, which is handy in a dimly lit room, with a power button and two settings for luke warm milk or refrigerated milk. HOWEVER, the Born Free control is pretty cheap, the buttons and turning dial are loose, and when adjusting the time desired it can be tricky to get the exact number you want. It does however remember the previous setting which means you can be warming milk with two clicks of the power button. The Kozii you have to set the time every time. If you want to power off early on the Born Free you just press the power button, on the Kozii you have to turn the timer off which is harder than you'd expect one handed.<br /><br />Refilling Water: Kozii: 4/5 Born Free: 4/5<br />At first, the instructions to the Kozii made filling the bottle warmer complicated and hard to do. The water level indicator is in the bottom of the well, where the Born Free contains a see-through water container on the side that is easier to see if you're running low. However, one of the tips I learned with the Kozii is to fill the bottle warmer up as it’s running till the water level reaches the overflow, which is a lot easier than the Born Free where it is a separate container you have to screw the lid off of and fill at the sink. Both need to be refilled about every other day.<br /><br />Counter Space: Kozii: 5/5 Born Free: 4/5<br /><br />Sound: Kozii: 5/5 Born Free: 3/5<br />Neither has a buzzer for when the milk is warmed which I wish they had but the Kozii does run whisper quiet where the Born Free does operate a bit louder, not enough to make it annoying, but noticeable none the less.<br /><br />Issues:<br />Born Free: I already mentioned the Born Free water level during heating which was detrimental for us and required that we buy the Kozii.<br /><br />Kozii: As I mentioned reading the water level of the Kozii is difficult. Unless it is running, in which you just add water till it flows over into the overflow. Another big issue is if the Born Free runs dry is just turns off and blinks a red light. If the Kozii runs dry it can PERMANENTLY disable your bottle warmer, which is says is a “safety” issue.<br /><br />*The Born Free should receive an extra point or two for coming with a bottle cooler that you can store bottles in overnight, not that it's really all that handy, at least for us, but at least you have that option. It can detach as well from the main bottle warmer which is nice.e Born Free water level during heating which was detrimental for us and required that we buy the Kozii.<br /><br />Kozii: As I mentioned reading the water level of the Kozii is difficult.

B0042RU2SW|5|Item is adorable
B00192M7PY|2|After 2 years, the speaker is dead on one receiver and both receivers are \\"blipping\\" due to some unknown interference (we do not have 900 MHz wireless in the house) and the first lights are ALWAYS on.  These were fine for almost a year and a half and then they went downhill fast.  This gets very annoying at night when you are asleep and the lights are flickering for no reason at all.  We are trying to figure out what model to get next and believe that we will go digital next.    I read in another review that you should not have the receivers plugged in for more that 13 hours at a time.  If this is true, this is truly an absolutely horrible design.  We have these plugged in at all times, one in the living room and one in the bedroom.
B005MQR794|4|My toddler, who is 2.5, is very comfortable in this seat and prefers it to her others. We flew with it recently and while it was possible to wear like a backpack (straps for that sold extra) it felt heavier than I would have expected. It is also just a bit trickier to get installed in an airplane seat than I expected,  but it can be done. Make sure you put the seat belt between the back shell of the seat and the seat's cushion. So,  for my toddler,  it would be 5 stars; for me,  i'd give it 3. We can split the difference.
B004BQSOLQ|4|I purchased this for my grandson and it has been used both at home and when traveling.  He is now eating those messy, squishy finger foods and this product has made clean up a breeze!
B00G4C0HEW|5|My son loves this seat. He is using the regular seat but lately started to pee in the diaper again, because &#34;it's tricky&#34; in the toilet. We Started to use this seat and it is better than similar items without the grip. The seat still sliding a bit but not as the other. basically I threw away the previous sit because it was impossible for him to sit properly and it wasn't safe (easy to trip and fall). It's still not as good as the one that attaches to the regular toilet seat (with the adult one).<br /><br />The handles ate great and standing feature is very convenient. I can see myself taking it for a road trips etc.
B00BNZ8XM8|4|This stroller is very light, easy to use and it seems that my one-year old is comfortable in it. He really liked the Mickey Mouse design :). It's super useful when we have to use the bus, since our other stroller is not umbrella and it was a little bit more difficult to transport it. The only thing is that when we got it, the canopy was a little bent to one side. It seems kind of fragile but we haven't had any issue yet.<br />I have to mention that my husband doesn't find it very comfortable because it's a little low. For me it's ok but I'm petite!, I'm 5'2 so have that in mind if you're considering to purchase.
B00CGF1WPO|5|Item was delivered within a week. My husband was a little hesitant about the purchase as he thought the stuffed animal would weigh on our little one's neck; however, it's VERY lightweight and charming. We purchased the pink elephant.
B00171WXII|5|After reading how many 5 star reviews this snotsucker received, I decided to buy one and I am so glad I did!  It works so well.  I have had multiple nasal bulb aspirators and they barely work.  This gets out the snots from way up in the nasal passages and my baby can breathe when he is nursing now.  It definitely helps to use some saline first to loosen things up.  I wish I had known about this for my older son.  I highly recommend it!
B001Q3L8RY|5|I have 3 kids, 6, 5 and 1 and all 3 of them love to play with these in the tub!  I love Boon products.  These are no exception.  I love that they come apart, so you can get all the water out of them so mold doesn't get stuck.  And they both drip water and spray if you squeeze them.  Very fun.  Great bath toy!
B006ZVV0P2|3|Expected the design of the straps that go around the bottom to be better, it's just a stretchy strap that goes down the top and sits in the back of your front seat. Can be kind of annoying.  Other than that it fits and works great.
B003HIXOEG|5|Easy to put together instructions good quality.  Would recommend to a friend
B000GKU3QA|5|Very useful. Always use it at home and also perfect for travel.
B000H1OMHE|5|I have a 58 inch opening.  Fits wonderfully!  Great product and easy to install.  Got the product on time and all of the hardware was within its confines.
B004GXA6Y2|5|I got this seat for my 4 year old daughter who had just outgrown her carseat by length.  Since she was on the smaller side and only weighing around 32 lbs, I did not feel comfortable putting her in a non-harnessed booster but did not want to spend $100 or more on a larger carseat that could accomadate her longer since we probably wouldn't be using it long.  I was debating on getting this seat or the nautilus.  I settled on this one because of the cheaper price...and I'm glad I did.  We've been using this seat for 6 months now.  It's a really nice seat and I have no complaints with it.  The straps are easy to loosen and tighten and I have not had a problem with the straps getting twisted at all.  A few other reviews have commented that the straps are a rougher weave like material.  And I agree, they are, but that is a plus to me.  I think that is the reason I've never had a problem with the straps getting twisted.  My nearly 3 year old rides in a Graco carseat (I think comfort sport) and I am having to untwist the straps on that one nearly daily because they are so thin and a smooth material.  I'm to the point that I'm ready to replace that seat with a Maestro.
B004A9ZF3Y|5|Theses are awesome.  The only thing I bought in order to make baby my own baby food.  No need for fancy baby food makers, just steam on the stove, toss in the food processor then scoop into these.  Very easy, cubes slide right out.  Product was exactly as described and arrived on time.
B003SRIQLM|5|Love them!
B005IWMB2A|4|Ice cream is very good, the sound is also great. But the other two almost no sound, I do not know my baby will not hear attracted by it?
B00NUQZPR4|5|Pretty good size, my baby should be able to use this for a while. Cute and a good value.
B000046Q50|4|We have used these for all of our kids. They are not perfect but do work as advertised. My kids are smart enough to buckle and install the adjuster as needed. <BR>As a chiropractor, I can see they do move the belt to the proper spot. They do protect the neck area.<BR>Not perfect but better than nothing.
B001OE1PC8|5|Great product but not for kittens under 5 pounds , they can easily fit through the doors. Will be returning soon
B00CL6RZ0E|5|Product works even better than advertised for my City Select Stroller. There was an initial delay in receiving the product however the seller did an outstanding job contacting me on a daily basis to ensure that I received the product and was satisfied. I will be purchasing a second one as soon as I am done with this review. Took me about 2 minutes to install once I figured out that the seat had to be removed in order to install. Basically three steps to install and rock solid. Disengages easily and attached easily. There is nothing flimsy about this thing which says a lot about the City Select stroller I purchased. I cannot say enough about the fantastic service Baby's Den gave me on this product. I will be purchasing all of my baby needs from them.....
B00978OWVE|3|I really thought my 6-7 month old would love this... he loves putting cloth in his mouth. But, no. I think it has to do with your kid. Some might love it.
B0071D1AKI|5|with a step stool the can wash hands with ease. saw it in the day care it stays in place.
B0071RGKI6|5|Great product thank you
B001AH8JNC|4|My son (22 mos) was honestly a little afraid of this product for a while but after about a week he got curious and wanted to wear it. A month later he is potty trained, though we had been working on it for a while. He still likes to wear the \\"potty clock\\" and it serves as a good reminder to Nana to take him to the bathroom when he visits! The only problems I had were that the numbers are a bit hard to read and I wish that it could be set for less time (30 minutes was sometimes too long). However, my son HATED me pestering him to use the potty but when the watch went off he gladly ran to the bathroom! The words do wipe off as others have stated and it doesn't seem to be a very solidly made watch (though we never tested its water submersion capabilities fortunately!) but it is an inexpensive, fun and handy way to get your child to remember to sit on the potty. I would totally recommend giving it a try!
B00K0LXAYC|1|Package came damaged.
B001MTELJY|5|I was looking for a tub to put in the bottom of our shower, since we do not have a full size tub in our house-- this one is prefect! My son who is 10months old and very tall for his age (98%) fits great.  He loves to splash around and can sit and play until I make him get out!!!
B0078PW4R2|5|This turttle is very soft and it sooths my 5 month old to sleep everytime. I really appericate the timer. The timer allows me to go to bed right after i put the baby down so that i dont have to stay up and wait to turn it off once baby falls asleep.
B0002ZOI92|5|My daughter has really enjoyed this swing, she is 8 months old now and we put the \\"big\\" swing away a while ago because it didn't entertain her. This one is wonderful. It is kind of bulky when you fold it up, but it is great to bring with for trips, etc. We actually took it to the bowling alley with us. It worked great. We will also be taking it with on our next family vacation! This is a good buy!
B002OOWAB2|4|Excellent , it's just what I expected
B004K15CF8|4|Got this as a gift for the baby from my mother in law. after we did weeks and weeks of research on cribs. I Love this Crib. It does scratch really easily. not super super easy. but I have already took a little chip out of it when we decided to move the room around. It is really sturdy tho. im not worried about when my baby boy is older and jumps around.. My baby is not here yet but I ordered the safety 1st heavenly dreams white crib mattress. if you were questioning mattresses.
B00AEG15SQ|4|We have a constant issue with a &#34;few&#34; select people speeding down our easement!  It is gravel and they just dont get it.  There are kids and pets that roam around.  We live on a private lane, but it's still an issue.  I loved this sign when I saw it online and ordered in a hurry without really reading about it!  I was so pleased when it got here.  It was much bigger than I anticapted, which is good!  I also didnt realize it came with a stake for the ground!  I know, I know... I really should check things out better.  Those were all pleasant surprises.  However, I'm only rating this a 4 because in my fantasy land, I assumed it was a sturdy plastic.  (my fault, not the sellers)  We live in one of the most rainy parts of SW Washington and I'm not sure how long it will last.  Either way, I am super, duper happy with this sign. And I would order it again!  I recommend it for everyone that needs one!<br />Sheri
B001PBFWMO|3|NOT GREAT SUCTION...
B00834D5SO|5|Seems very stable. We had to google how to install the seat. We received the expansion seat belts like everyone else hassle free. My son cried for the4 first week being in the car seat. I think mainly because it is to tight. We had to make him forward facing because in bot the SUV and my camry he did not fit in the seat rear facing. My son is average size for a 1 year old and he barely fit. But he enjoys being able to watch us drive and interact with us.
B004DC9TDA|5|I really didn't think my 2 year old would spend much time in a stroller, which is why I bought a sit and stand(Joovy Ergo Caboose), instead of a double jogging stroller when we were expecting baby #2. Big mistake! The sit and stand was way too heavy and clunky. I had a hard time taking it to the park, because any patch of grass or mulch made it impossible to push. I sold the Joovy on craiglist and immediately spent the money on the BOB Revolution SE Duallie.<br /><br />I knew I wanted it because I have the BOB Revolution SE Single stroller and have always loved it. It's the 2010 model, which was great, but BOB has made some super great improvements on this model. I love the improved padded seats and shade umbrellas. The peek-a-boo windows on top are way bigger on this model, as well. The swivel front wheel is a must-have and makes this double easy to maneuver.<br /><br />I am 100% pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this stroller to anyone wanting a great quality jogging stroller for running or walking to your local parks or heading to the zoo.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this thing is pretty gigantic, as are all double strollers, I suppose. It would not be a good mall stroller or travel stroller.
B004V2WMUO|4|Received mine in a timely fashion and also ordered at six months preg because of other reviews.  This is not a true white as another post stated, it is off white...light ivory.  We have a true stark white dresser so we will possibly paint just so it looks seamless.  Very strong, not flimsy.  I wasn't even going to use one but I thought it might be helpful.  Good luck<br />Update...<br />we found a Large crack, it has not affected the use but sad to see this.
B001IACJQ4|5|It was either buy this from Wal-Mart or Amazon for the same price!! Easy to assemble and Comfy! I would recommend this!!
B001IH3998|5|My 4 1/2 yr old grandson loves this. I read other reviews that stated it was too small but it wrapped around him just fine and he's tall for his age. He may only be able to use it for a year if he grows as fast as he has been but it was a gift for a special vacation he will be going on.
B004GTLRY4|5|Excellant, multi-use product.  They are very soft and absorbant.  We use them as burp cloths, not diapers.  Great price too.
B00296BY4O|5|We received one of these blankets as a baby gift and it became my sons favorite blanket.  He takes it everywhere!  It is really soft on one side and silky on the other.  We searched Amazon and found the same blanket so we had two.  He would never let the first one go so that I could wash it!  Now we can swap them out.
B00AHPZZGC|5|I am very familiar with this seat as I babysit my nephew daily and he has this exact model.  I only have a couple complaints about the seat and they're not major issues.  Now that I am pregnant, I will likely buy the same seat for my own child.  P.S. my nephew is now in the chicco next fit and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />Pros-<br />Operation..all around.  The way it latches and unlatches from the base is easy.  The way the belts tighten and loosen to fit baby is great.  The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.<br /><br />Installation was so easy.<br /><br />The material feels durable without being stiff.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The canopy doesn't cover much at all.<br />The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.<br />The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.
B00GR2ABK4|5|We like to keep our boys sleeping materials as green as possible and these seem to fit that criteria.  The boys like them and they give mom and dad some peace of mind that they are healthy material to be next to hours each day.
B00GSX2B5U|5|I did a lot of research before I decided on the play-mat. I am so glad I went with this one. If keeps my little guy entertained and it was easy to assemble. I love that I can attach my own choice of toys too. I would defiantly recommend this mat to anyone.
B00BCDDZSI|2|Easy to assemble, solid piece of furniture.  Not sure why the color doesn't even come close to matching the espresso crib and changing table we already purchased.  The box states we ordered the correct dresser, but after assembling, the piece looks closer to cherry color only darker.  Very disappointed with our Graco purchase.
B00HTQ6NCW|5|My 2 year old loves these sheets, and they are a nice material
B00849L490|5|This Jar could hold warm food for five hours and cold food for up to 7 hours. So its easy for mom to preparing the baby food first as going out. Also I like the stainless steel which is much safe than plastic one and glass one. It's small so easy to put in the handbag and I like the color as well. Very easy to clean it. Highly recommended!
B00G3H0G2G|5|Works great for snacks in the car, and wipes clean easily even with sticky PBJ sandwiches.
B00B1CELVU|4|bought the seat for my grandson.  It is what I expected and fits in the vehicle well.  He seems to like it.
B0073DNYSW|5|I bought this while I was pregnant because it seemed versatile enough that we were bound to use it for something. The first 5 weeks, we just used it as a place to put my daughter while we cooked dinners and watched TV. After her eyesight improved, around 5 weeks, the hanging snail and super annoying music delights her like no other.
B000056J90|4|If you have a medela pump, you will need one or two sets of these bottles for milk storage and feeding.  I originally starting pumping and storing the milk in the freezer bags (Lansinoh bags are the absolute best bags, no leaking, double zipper seals,  very strong, and hold six ounces-the others only hold five)but when i discovered that I could freeze these bottles, i realized it would be much easier to pump into them and feed straight out of them.  The nipples that came with the set were the weirdest ever, my baby just hated them so we don't use them at all.  The caps are very handy too.  The bottles will hold a full six ounces of milk, although you don't want to freeze them with that much milk, as you have to leave room in the bottle for expansion. The rings and nipples from our Gerber bottles fill just right, as would any other rings and nipples, i would imagine.  They're pretty much universal in size, so if your baby doesn't like these nipples, just buy an inexpensive pack from another brand. I bought this set at Target, for about the same price as on this site, except without the shipping fee.  I must say, I've been impressed with my pump in style advanced pump, and wouldn't trade it for anything else.  If you're going to have the best pump, might as well have the best of bottles to go with it.  These bottles are easy to clean with a bottle brush, or in the dishwasher.  Make sure you have plenty, since you'll need two bottles to pump into each time.  It does get tedious washing them frequently.  Hope this review helps you...good luck.
B00HT6E6GW|5|The Diaper Genie Elite Pail are great and I love them. The cost is worth keeping the diapers out of my kitchen trash and I have on occasion smelled them in the hall area where I keep the diaper Genie Elite Pail but have learned to change the carbon filter when I do.<br /><br />As for the Diaper Genie bag refills: If you buy three of these refills, currently at $18.99, each refill cost $6.33. If you get four bags out of each refill it cost $1.58 for each of the four sections of a refill. The refill (four bags out of one refill) holds 120 total of my 14 month old baby's diapers(using the method below). That's $0.05 cents a diaper. Even at 10 diapers a day, (which is high), it is only $0.50 per day.<br /><br />The way I do this is that I fill the pail as much as possible. Then I open the pail and pull the diapers and bag out of the pail but don't cut the bag yet. I hold the bag closed just above the last diapers and shake them around to get them to settle in the bottom of the bag. Then I squish them down using my hands first and then my knee until i have gotten to the point that the bag might break or I just can't push down any more. repeat this process as long as you get results. (You will need to let the air out of the bag during this process by opening and closing your hand that is around the bag and it will be stinky but only for a couple minutes.) Then i cut the bag with scissors, leaving a hand width b/w diapers and where I am cutting the bag so I can tie the used bag off. I throw the used diapers and bag away in the dumpster. I then retie the bag left in the pail and place it back in the pail and close the lid. This is how I get the most out of my diaper pail and I haven't actually had a bag burst open during the process.
B000I2Q0F4|5|Baby likes it.
B009CASDF8|5|These are my daughter's favorite pacifiers. They're a life saver at nap and bedtime when she just wants to fuss. Easy to clean and no hard plastic parts.
B0078LTT8S|4|Good product. I had one like this before. After a lot of use it shreds a little on the edges.
B000O7SR18|4|This was delivered on time too soft and fits the mattress well. I give it four stars because I don't like the color.
B004610FJK|3|Nothing wrong with the product.  My son chewed his shirts, I thought this would be a good alternative.  It was not.  He was not interested in chewing on rubber.  oh well.
B0054XD60E|4|Great gift..
B0002ZOI8I|4|This is a nice bouncer that was quite easy to assemble. All parts & pieces fit as they should. Removing the toy bar is easy enough to use w/newborns. Vibration feature is good and strong and music/natural animal sounds are very soothing. Only drawbacks (minor) are that the speaker faces outward (not toward baby) and the two volumes (high and low) are at extreme ends of the spectrum, and the spinning bird in the middle is hard plastic that when spun fast, may possibly startle/bonk baby if hit by it. Otherwise, a great product to give mom/dad much needed free hands for a few minutes as baby snoozes, gazes or enjoys the toys.
B000056JC1|1|bad
B009A7VTYA|5|This product is a must have for the nursery. It is so easy to clean up after baby's mess. Our little one has a tendency to pee multiple times during diaper changes and with the Keekaroo, there's no need to change sheets - just wipe up the mess. Even though it is a pricy product, the hassle free aspect is worth the cost. Comes in lovely colours too!
B002BSHTS0|4|I love the bright colors and black/white spirals on this mobile.  It's got more of a modern feel to it than your typical mobiles with pastel-colored plush animals and a wind-up music mechanism.  My daughter wasn't too into this at first, but I think once her sight became better, it was a great distraction to keep her occupied in her crib.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Bright colors, black and white spirals great for catching baby's attention<br />- Option to choose from three different songs<br />- Volume adjust<br />- Night light (though I really don't ever use this...seems sort of useless given your baby probably wants to look at this with the light on)<br />- Quick release to take the mobile off the base unit is really handy for when I'm changing the sheets in the crib<br />- Quick and easy installation on crib, secure fit<br />- Automatic timer shut-off<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I wish there was an option to cycle it on longer!<br />- This is as bit loud with the plastic beads that slide down as the mobile turns.  If you're looking for something more \\"soothing\\", this is definitely not it.  I found this mobile to be more stimulating for my daughter than anything.
B007NG5UGS|4|[[VIDEOID:mo1FFFJZP3RHO75]]I've used his baby moniter for about 3 months and it works nice, with a few draw backs.<br /><br />CONS<br />-  The talk to baby feature was working well for awhile but then it started to sound very robotic and you can't understand what's being said.<br />-  the monitor is always on even if there is no noise,  I used to have the levana baby monitor and it would stay off when there was no motion or noise.  there should be an option to have the screen not be on when there is no noise.<br />(But I also had a lot of problems with that baby moniter-awful battery life, & connection problems[[ASIN:B008P8EZOG Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom]]<br />-I really don't like how this is set for for using additional cameras.  If you have 2 cameras or more connected, you cannot hear when one of them cries or makes noise.  You just have to keep watching the monitor and see if a message comes up that says there is noise happening in one of the cameras.<br />-the graphics aren't good.<br />-you can't play music to your baby using the parent unit, which that feature on the levana baby monitor I really liked because my son really liked it and would keep him calm and sometimes he would go back to sleep.<br />-there is no belt hook, which the levana baby monitor had, it was nice to be able to hook it to your clothes and do things around the house.  This one I just have to carry.<br /><br />PROS<br />-very recently my son got ahold of the monitor and put it in the dog water...  We aired it out and it works fine.  He has also thrown it a few times.  It still works fine.  This thing is built like the rock!  So 5 stars for durability!<br />-the battery life is great, it lasts for about 8 hours<br />-I never had connection problems<br />- I do have this mounted on the wall in his room and it works great!  The bottom looks like the tripod hook ups on cameras.<br /><br />Overall, I like the camera-even though my cons list is much longer than my pros list. I would probably consider most of the things on the cons list as being minor. It's great for the price.  As long as it connects with ease and has good battery life, I'm happy.
B002WB2G9I|1|pros:very light weight ,high enough dont have to bend to push.<br />cons: it doesn't recline which make it uncomfortable for sleeping,not very sturdy my son 25 lbs and it coming apart in seat area.
B0045Y1F4W|3|But that's about it...  It doesn't get in the way and I didn't have to spend $100, so I would say its worth the purchase.  It takes up a lot of room and I find it to be clunky. Overall good product but nothing to rave about.  Clunky would describe it best.
B007JSETOO|5|Bought this to fit in my daughter's pop up castle in her room and it fit perfectly with a little room. It's do u left sided but the printed side is soooo pretty.
B00TJIK08G|5|we loVe these! They have held up so well with my little crawler!
B004G8QJ9I|3|It was very cute. When washed though, water seeped into rattle globe.
B000IDSLOG|5|We are very pleased with this purchase!  We have purchased 2 Sophies (1 for each child) and both loved to chew and play with the toy.
B005O6FZ3M|5|Sticky film really good for warm weather, I've used on front windows and it works<br />Perfectly to protect my sensitive skin. Unfortunately when the weather gets cold the film<br />tends to take off the glass, but you put some water and stick it again. It doesn't cover the<br />whole window though as it has rectangular shape.
B00AQ092V2|4|Don't ask me about fashion, but I can tell you about construction: this is a solid diaper bag, well made, and with a lot of extras.  The (fake) leather is easy to clean, the bag has a lot of compartments, zippers, flaps, and attachments.  Other than the sharp outside zippers, this bag seems to really hit the mark -that is, if you are looking for a colorful well made bag that you might be able to pass off as a large purse.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />*** COMES WITH A LOT OF STUFF.  1) Matching changing pad with diapers/wipes pocket 2) Separate mini-purse 3) Stroller straps 4) Insulated bottle holder 5) Dirty clothes bag 6) A guilty conscience because do I really need ALL this stuff?<br /><br />*** MANY POCKETS.  This is the Leatherman Tool of diaper bags... These are the cargo shorts of maternity.  I swear that I would lose a baby in this bag.  You have several tension holders in the bag to holder extra diapers or bottles, and there are enough zippers and snaps to make you pine for simpler times...<br /><br />** ADJUSTABLE/REMOVABLE SHOULDER STRAP.  The ends of the strap are thick, high quality hooks, and they close and open with ease. There is also ample space within the bag to store the strap.<br /><br />** MINI PURSE INSIDE.  As noted above, there is a purse on the inside large enough for personal essentials so you don't have to take the whole bag with you, if you can leave the rest of it with someone.<br /><br />** COMES WITH PADDED CHANGING PAD.  This pad hides in an interior pocket, and has a mesh holder on the side which allows you to store a diaper in it as well.  The pad closes with velcro, and is definitely large enough to use easily, along with being water resistant and easy to clean.<br /><br />** HANDLES SECURED WITH RIVETS.  I'm always happy when my clothing/apparel involves rivets.  That bag handle ain't going nowhere -even if I fill the bag with bricks.<br /><br />* WATER RESISTANT LINING.  So the bag claims.  NOT water proof, but I can see that spills would not easily pass through the bag walls.<br /><br />* STROLLER STRAPS INCLUDED.  This is neat, and they come with a picture on the bag tag on how to use them.<br /><br />* PVC FREE BAGS.  This is good, right?<br /><br />* INSULATED BOTTLE HOLDER.  There are two secured inner bag spots for bottles but only one bottle holder.  The bottle holder is a thin padded material with reflective silver on the inside.  I suppose it will work, which is why I consider it a positive, but I am not crazy about it.  I would buy something specifically for my bottle if I really wanted an insulated holder.<br /><br />NEUTRAL<br /><br />  FAKE LEATHER.  If you want real leather then avoid this bag.  If you don't care, then this may be for you.<br /><br />  KEY HOLDER INSIDE.  Basically this is a tension hook where you could hold your keys or something. Not sure of the necessity for it, but maybe it is like the awl on your Swiss Army knife for some people.  It just gives you a warm and fuzzy knowing that it is there and you could make an extra hole in your belt if you really had to...<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-- ZIPPERS ARE LARGE AND SHARP.  This is the only thing I didn't like about the bag.  Though their color is a very nice antiquated brass, they seem to be industrial style zippers which look very sharp.  You could easily scratch yourself on these.  If zippers could be a little intimidating, then these are.<br /><br />- PRICEY.  You are probably paying a lot for the style factor.  I hadn't heard of this brand so that part was lost on me. I bet you could get something similar for half the cost.

B002SG7JSU|1|IT WAS CRAP I HATE IT IT JUST TOYS NOTHING MORE<br />DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY PLEASE THIS IS MY OPINION FROM MY DEEPEST FEEILING
B008WNV5EC|4|I've been using this bag for about a month and so far I really like it. Being able to have my toddlers food in a separate compartment works really well to free up space in the main part of the bag. Love the pocket for wallet and phone so I don't have to rummage through the whole bag to find them. I like the stroller attachments but it can be fiddly to attach at times when the bag is quite heavy. Overall the best nappy bag I have owned.
B002PUR7YU|4|Colors are not as vibrant as I hoped. Rather subdued. Quality is excellent, tho.
B005HK4ICE|1|This is terrible. NEVER prop a bottle. Baby could aspirate. It would be like an adult not being able to stop fluid from being shoved down their throat. Hold your baby to feed it. It is not a burden as the description says. They are young for such a short amount of time. Please do not prop bottles! I wish I could give 0 stars.
B000F7M81W|5|My grandson loves cars and these are great when we're out and about
B00B7M7BKW|4|This car seat protector is really the best one out there that I have found... except it is monstrous.  It fits well in my F250 quad cab, but not so much in my mid size sedan.  Its competition seemed to have one resounding flaw: melting glue that ruins leather.  Not so with this protector.  I ordered 2 and they fit next to each other fine in the afore mentioned truck, but in the sedan we are considering ordering another and bending one of the corners to make it fit.  This item does protect seats very well and would have earned 5 stars; perhaps they could make a slightly smaller version.
B0072KO066|5|this system works GREAT !!!  but DON'T lose the key because.... this system works GREAT !!! so but an extra and keep it close just in case.
B00MRZIGWA|5|This cup is fantastic! My 15 month old loves it and so do I.  He figured it out immediately and it hasn't spilled a drop despite his banging and dropping it.  It can be a little difficult to get ahold of the silicone plug to remove it for washing, but it's not a big deal.  I'm ready to make this our go-to milk cup.
B00BUBNZB4|5|Love it, does its job!
B00OJMAHPS|5|Excellent stroller travel bag.
B0033PRFOS|5|I LOVE that the straps are so easy to adjust with the knobs located on either side of the seat.  So much easier than having to go behind the seat to adjust them.  I purchased this seat for my daughter about two years ago after reading that it received very similar safety reviews from Consumer Reports as the Britax, but costs significantly less!  The fabric is pretty durable and has held up well so far.  We had no problems installing it after reading the instructions and my daughter seems very comfortable.  I just ordered the same seat (different pattern) from Amazon for my son who has outgrown his infant seat.  The only downside is that it's cumbersome to carry around when traveling, but aren't they all?  We have an older Honda Civic and both seats fit, but there definitely isn't room for a fifth passenger now.  Overall this seat is great, which is why I didn't hesitate to purchase again for my son!
B00O4F2I2U|2|More powerful night vision = way too bright.  I had to turn down the brightness setting to minimum in order to see the image in night vision (if the object is within 10 feet).  The auto tracking function is cool but very sensitive.  If the objective is too close or too far, the unit wont' track correctly.  But after all, I think it's a cool function if you plan to monitor a kid playing in the room or in the backyard.  In my case, I don't plan to leave my baby alone to play, so it doesn't mean too much to me.  The reason I only gave 2 stars is the unit stop working after a week.  The parent device screen keep flicking, losing connection with the monitor even when it's right next to it.  I would only be able to connect for 1 minute, and then they disconnect again.  So I had to return the unit.  Hope this was just one time incident, and good luck with your purchase
B002D40ZMY|5|This outfit is absolutely adorable, and the box it comes in is so cute too. My baby looks like he's ready for training =)
B000066665|1|Good for a while then it cant keep the air inside dont know why
B000BH79QA|4|Both my 19 month old and 6yr old grand daughters have a blast with these in the tub. They don't squirt a whole lot of water either so it isn't as wet in the bathroom as I thought it would be which is good!
B002A9JCVW|5|easy to assemble.<br />very handy for drying bottles and accessory. plus it look so cute.<br />it absolutely has no problem in holding up born-free glass bottles.<br />highly recommend
B00AJSIXUC|3|I bought this to replace a Britax Regent that was expiring.  I tried a Graco Nautalis first but my daughter didn't like the &#34;wings&#34; around her head at all.  We both like the size and shape of this one.  The only reason I don't like it is because the buckle is so hard to do.  We drive through a school drop of line and my daughter (6 yrs) needs to be able to get herself in and out without help.  She just can't do that in this seat.  Even I have trouble with it.  We ended up using it in the hubby's car and getting another Britax for mine.
B00KYMKP2M|3|This came in a loose package, no directions to put together so you just have to figure it out....pieces didn't line up the best and were a little miscut, but if you have a kid who wants to have a baby carriage to play with their dolls, it is a good enough product. Works with Disney Princess or Barbie dolls.
B0018Z6910|5|This was great!  Worked like a charm and 3 kids later is still going strong!
B002SM727M|4|Wonderful blanket!  We put it over his bad at the NICU!  Great compliment to his cowboy themed nursery!
B004LE8TB8|5|I bought the Little Champs calendar for my son and it is so easy to remember to log his milestones! I had to get this for my friend when we found out she was having a girl. I will get this as a gift for almost everyone I know that is have a baby!
B0091BTTJM|5|The product was delivered earlier than expected, being delivered in time for the baby shower.  I have purchased this product multiple times as a gift for the mother to be.  It makes a great gift and is greatly appreciated when the baby arrives.
B001F37M6Q|5|My 11 month old loves these. I actually bought it for him when he was 4 month old. I figured they are soft so you dont need to worry about him hurting himself smacking or throwing them. He loved playing with them in his highchair. As he got older we moved them to the tub and pool. The coolest part about these is that the green ground floats and you can build on it while in the pool or tub. My kids loved teething on these too. He used to carry a wall with him where ever he went. Not a bad toy and the price is great. there are so many electronic, loud annoying musical/sound toys out there- some good some horrible but this is one simple toy that can travel anywhere. Great for the summer if you child likes to play in the water.
B00DGLVDYC|5|Beautiful design and it works really well. So happy with the purchase.
B000KJBFC8|4|I bought two of these for my almost three year old daughter and my five year old son.  While these trays are flexible, they still made great surfaces for Legos, coloring books, and Littlest Pet Shop sets.  The flexibility actually makes it easier to store the trays.
B00AUIZG06|5|Good quality high chair and priced right!!
B001QKJ9SC|5|this is cool it keeps kids from sneaking out of their room when they should be taking a nap ...Cool!
B00O5IU8SM|3|It does the job, we have more peace of mind when we leave our daughter upstairs in her crib since we can see her.  However the screen is small so I have to have it close by to see her movements.  Overall its worth it for the price but if you want something nicer with a bigger screen then I would go with something else.
B0039GF6EC|5|I really like this wet bag. I use it for my diaper bag to store my sons cloth diapers. I've never had trouble with leaks & it does keep odor from escaping. It was smaller than I expected. The specs say it holds 2-3 cloth diapers but I use pocket diapers and there is no way it holds 3... Two if I squeeze. I've already ordered the larger size because I've been so happy with this one.
B00KS4CHTA|5|Perfect!! Thank you!
B00C5KAZFI|2|I received the beaba bottle drying rack very quickly once ordered from Amazon.  I was very excited; however, when I opened the package I noticed that the drying rack was sent to me broken.  One of the smaller purple prongs on the bottom of the rack was completely broken off, floating aimlessly inside the package.  Since the actual drying rack packaging AND the box that it came in was not damaged, I can only assume it was packaged and sent to me ALREADY broken.  I was upset and immediately returned the product.  I ordered a new one on a different website.  I was disappointed in this experience, but I have the feeling I am still going to love the drying rack.
B00CKVMZP0|5|I can't wait for my son to sleep on this! It is plush, super soft and so much nicer than any other nap mat I have ever seen. My son was super excited when it came out of the box and he kept pretending to put his toys to sleep under the blanket. I finally enticed him to lay down in it because I wanted to make sure he was comfortable with it too and I know this will be coming along on trips we take where there won't be a toddler crib for him to use.
B008X6RGZA|4|These have been great for transitioning from bottles, as my toddler was chewing the plastic off of the nipples and it was time. He took to the cups quickly and they've been nearly 100% spill proof. If he throws it on the ground hard, some milk might spill out on occasion. The piece that makes it spill proof has come loose a few times, but it's easy to identify when that happens and it's typically only when the cup is thrown on the ground.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the clear exterior hard shells on 2 of the 3 cups have broken. I'm assuming it's from the repeated twisting on and off of the lid. Maybe I've twisted the lids too tight. Nevertheless, the cups are still usable and would recommend them.
B0010P5Q7Q|3|This is fine and dandy as a basic potty seat, but on bot our somewhat elongated toilet rims, the seat slides around.  The 4 foam feed that they provide are no help.  I'll have to rig something up to make it stay in place.  Other than that, has handles, a picture of the McQueen car (only on a sticket on the back flap), and a \\"pee catcher\\".
B008Y2DFLM|5|Great quality and worth every penny.
B00GR4LQMO|2|Cute and great for a little princess. I wish the Velcro that held the princess skirt on was covered when the skirt wasn't in use bc other things :like the straps) get snagged on the Velcro. That said, it's an adorable little backpack. The skirt is fully detachable, which is nice.  ****UPDATE**** Sadly, this little backpack did last long at all. It is sturdy enough, assuming it never has to be laundered. I washed it on gentle with cold water and let it air dry, only to find that the pretty princesses were cracked and broken. I'll have to get a new backpack.   The skirt makes it impossible for a toddler to be self sufficient with the backpack, and a second pocket would be ideal so that binkis could have a clean spot that differs from the pocket for toys. But for the price it's fine, as long as you never have to wash it :(
B00MYQROMU|5|Very sturdy and easy to assemble. The LATCH mechanisms (to attach to anchor points) are the easiest to operate I have ever seen in a car seat. All in all extremely satisfied
B00PHVLBFA|5|I am very happy with this bowl. I've used it many times and it is holding up very well, even with multiple passes through the microwave and dishwasher. It's a little bulky with the masher, it's too bad there isn't a way to store the masher inside, but I still find it very useful. It mashed bananas like a champ. I haven't been able to get harder stuff like apples to cook down enough in the microwave to mash very easily. I might be doing something wrong though. One thing I've noticed is that if you put too much water in it to steam in the microwave, the water will spill out the top, along with whatever food juice you're cooking. I got blueberry juice all over the place. So definitely keep an eye on whatever you're cooking so it doesn't spill over!
B000H1MRJO|2|I would not purchase this again.  It is cute and sturdy, however, there is a nylon strap down the middle going across the short way.  The strap raised the middle up leaving two \\"pockets\\" on each end that make it impossible to lay flat without being raised up at the waist.  I placed a very thick dog mattress that I purchased to use in a porta-crib on top, and it did little to alleviate the unevenness.  My daughter will curl up on one end or the other.  Don't waste your money.  I am sure there is a better alternative.
B0055DTNMI|5|Mid level quality at very good price. Not as hard to put together as other reviews said. Would recommend to anyone.
B004WPKWNO|5|Great item!! Easy to put up. Looks great, durable and my son loves touching all the letters.
B001G4VBQ6|5|PERFECT!
B0051T8O7Q|5|The green looks more like sage green than the mint green in the photo. I was happy about that. The fabric is nice and the sheet looks well made. Glad I bought it so far.
B00203PFWS|5|Comes with the medela bags so you get a \\"feel\\" for them before you decide to buy and use them or not.  I prefer the Lansinoh bags because they are easier to seal and hold more.  Only plus to Medela bags are that they can be attached to pump.  Downside is you really shouldn't put more than 4 1/2 oz. in them because the seal isn't great and the milk expands during freezing causing spillage.  Also, once my milk came in, I was pumping 5 oz. or more per breast so I had to keep checking the bags while I pumped to make sure I didn't overfill.  (Ended up buying some cheap 8 oz. Gerber bottles to pump into and so I wouldn't have to worry about overfilling and I just pour into bags to freeze once I am done.)  Good deal since three 4 oz. bottles are about $17+ tax alone.  I was going to buy the bulk pack of the 2 oz. storage bottles but now am glad that I didn't.  The six are enough and I am not needing them now.  We were having latching problems so they were useful, but now that we've got bf down, I hardly use them.  Also, once baby gets older, you'll be feeding lots more than 2 oz. at a time.  Might be useful again once I get back to work though.  Also good to get the bottle spare parts when you purchase this because all those little pieces tend to get misplaced/lost.  Pump will attach to both bottle and 2 oz. bottles and you can feed straight out of 2 oz. bottle also.
B004L2JJAK|4|The mirror works fine, but I'm a tad too short to see in it as well as I would want.
B008UOX3CU|5|Looks great<br />What we expected
B005XTCOP2|4|Does the job.
B004K38FNM|5|It perfect baby thinks very soft it strong works good for play time
B000067EH7|5|This is THE tub to get.  My only regret is that I didn't have it until my fourth child!  I've tried many tubs and bath seats.  This is the only one that I can honestly say has worked perfectly from baby stage to stage.  Fits perfectly in our kitchen double sink.  I'm not breaking my back at bath time.  Baby is comfortable and happy in it.  The &#34;bump&#34; in the bottom of the tub holds baby up very nicely so I'm not having to worry about him sliding down while bathing.  Learn from my trials and errors - get this for your first baby and keep it for the rest!
B000GKWA66|5|We love this sheep!  We use it every night as a part of our bed time routine.  We've used it since our little girl was born, and she's now almost 8 months and it's still part of our nightly routine.  She knows when she starts hearing the \\"Oceans\\" sound, that it's time to relax and settle in for bed.  It's also great for when we have guests over and making a lot of racket.. it acts as nice white noise to drown out the sound a bit if she's asleep.  (And it's adorable looking to boot.)  We love this!  We even bought the travel version since we go to the beach a lot in the summer.  Definitely highly recommend.
B002A9JCY4|2|It was fun while it lasted but a strand of hair got sucked up and burnt out the fountain.  It still floats and lights up but no more fountain.
B003YVTSMS|5|absolutley love this bedding set! the comforter is thick and soft and the sheets and pillow case are soft and silky. my little girl loved this set!
B001LNOYNY|5|Our baby has slept in his Swaddleme every night since he was born. He loves it and wouldn't sleep without it! It also keeps him warm through the night without risking using a blanket. Now that he's two months old, he's decided he doesn't want his right arm wrapped in the swaddle. This doesn't alter the usefulness of the swaddle, though.    We haven't had any problems with him breaking out of the swaddle.     It was an excellent purchase and we have two flannel and four fleece. We use them daily. Excellent purchase.
B000WJLKQM|5|My daughter loves jumping in this--it is her favorite! It is safe and durable--very well made. A must for active babies.
B00KFQKMV6|5|Very quick delivery with Prime.  This stroller organizer fits both our Britax B-Agile and Baby Jogger Summit X3 perfectly.  The drink holders are large enough to fit bigger water bottles (Camelbak straw and Hydroflask).  We also really enjoy the middle insulated magnetic-close compartment, great for storing an extra juice box or small bottle of milk.  The velcro is very strong so there's no fear of it ever falling off or coming loose.  Great product!
B001I463G2|5|Very large compared to all the other playpens I have seen. Very well made and sturdy. Everyone who has seen mine loves it and wants one of their own.
B0009RMHC8|2|If you have a newborn baby who can't hold his or her head up yet, this is NOT a good choice for a carrier (even if you try to \\"tuck\\" his or her head to one side behind the fabric, it inevitably shifts, and there goes baby's head!). A better choice for newborns is the BABY BJORN carrier - it fully supports them, and keeps them close to your body and therefore feeling more secure for them. Also, if you don't have 20 minutes (ok, an exaggeration...) to put this on (wrapping it this way, that way, up and over, etc.), DON'T BOTHER. The only positive thing I can say is that it is more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn (because it's softer).
B002D7HN94|4|When my baby started teething she also started drooling all over the rail, so I bought the front rail cover, then she moved to the side rails and started chewing on it (teeth marks in the wood), this side covers are as essential as the front cover. Just one detail, the crib I have is attached to a changing table so on that side the cover doesn't work well.
B006GH4QS8|4|I purchased these as a less expensive alternative to the aden and anais blanket we were given as gifts. They are nice and the material seems of equal quality  but they certainly lack the softness of aden and anais, particularly the printed ones. They aren't so scratchy they might leave redness on a little ones skin, but I'm afraid they might be uncomfortable. We are currently using them as a thin cover for little one in his carseat when we must go out to the pediatrician and such during cold/flu season. I'm hoping they will soften with repeated washings.
B00ATLI7QO|5|Love the grippers! My son was so excited to be able to stand at he sink like mommy and daddy and I didn't have to worry about the stool slipping or being top heavy and falling forward. We had recently purchased a wooden two tiered one that was cute but impractical. No grips and top heavy. We returned and found this one for an awesome price on Amazon. My son now loves brushing his teeth!
B00171WXII|5|Amazing product! At first I was totally against sucking stuff out of my baby's nose but my sister had it and showed me how to use it and I fell in love instantly! I recommend this product to all parents out there!
B000HZI1R2|5|This is my third baby and while I made a valiant effort to nurse my two older daughters, breastfeeding for me was a COMPLETE failure.  I wound up giving both my older girls bottles of formula as well as expressed breast milk.  I pumped for 5 months with my oldest daughter and for 4 months with my youngest daughter.  Back then I used a boppy pillow and I never felt like the girls were in a proper position and I sure as heck was uncomfortable.  For a variety of reasons, I wound up with bleeding and cracked nipples, severe breast infections and clogged ducts and if was for me just too damn painful to nurse, so I resorted to pumping.    With my third child, who just turned 5 weeks old, I've been able to breastfeed with relative ease and I know that this pillow has been part of the solution.  The baby and I are perfectly positioned.  I do not have to hunch over, or hang on for dear life to pillows.  I am hands-free to stroke my baby's cheek, or reach for the remote control.  I wish this pillow had been around when I was attempting to breastfeed my other daughters.      I would highly recommend buying an extra cover.  Breastfeeding is messy due to leakage and spit-ups.  You might even want to buy two, so you'll have one for the pillow, one in the laundry and one in the drawer ready to swap out!!      Also, the pillow will fit anyone.  I first tried it on when I was 2 weeks overdue and thus hugely pregnant and the buckle had plenty of room and I'm not a tiny woman.  I wore a size 12 prior to this pregnancy and got up to a size 14/16 in my last month.  The buckle will easily expand, or now (thank goodness) contract to fit your ever changing shape.      Lastly, I bought mine on Craig's list.  It had never been used and I only spent $10.00, but having used it for the past 5 weeks, I would certainly have spent the $60.00 and it would have been worth every penny.      Buy this.  I cannot understand the negative reviews, they must be from the maker of the boppy!!!
B006ZOIT7Q|5|My daughter seems much happier when wearing her Amber necklace. Her gums aren't as swollen and she doesn't drool as much as when she doesn't wear it. I would recommend this product to anyone with a teething baby!
B005S1TXSG|5|My son is now completely potty trained because of this urinal.  He feels like a big boy whenever he uses it!
B001IXYOD2|3|Dr. Brown's helped minimize my son's battle with colic, and I'm very appreciative of that!<br />The bottles were easy to clean, and helped minimize air bubbles in his tummy.  I recommend!
B00DB5IYHW|4|The fabric was not very soft initially, but got softer after couple of washes, nice colors.  My son loves the the aquatic images and points to them every time he wakes up.
B00ONXWMNS|5|These look great on the wall in my son's nursery.  I was initially a bit intimidated and wasn't sure if I could do it on my own, but it really wasn't that difficult.  I think the trick is to cut the trees in half before you affix the decal to the wall (one of the trees came in 2 pieces, which gave me the idea).  I taped each of the trees to my wall with painter's tape to get them aligned the way I wanted.  Once I had them in place, I cut the tree in half.  I then removed the lower portion of the tree, removed the backing and affixed the decal to the wall, aligned with the top of the decal which was still taped to the wall.  Once I had that in place, I did the same with the top half of the tree, ensuring it was lined up with the bottom half.  I'm sure there are other ways to do this, but I found this to be the easiest.  It probably took me about 90 minutes in total (though I was trying to do this while my son was napping, so I was interrupted a few times : ).  I haven't decided whether I'm going to add the branches or the leaves yet - I kind of like the simplicity of the design as it is.
B006WLDLLG|5|Bought  this for my three yr old.  Love it and so does he!  He has no prinlem gettung comfortable or falling asleep in it.  As soon as you pick it up you can tell how strong and well made this is.  Happy that it is made in USA.  Spot cleans well.  Will purchase another Recaro for baby soon to be.
B0017RNGWY|4|Love these!  They are quite small so we use them in combination with a set of Ducky mats and a larger single frog mat.  Olivia loves to try to pull them off and on again.  The combination of yellow ducks, purple stars, and green frog makes for a colorful bath time!  Only draw back... Some of the face colour seems to come off after a while.
B001QXCF0I|5|Its nice...vibrant colors. Great for the kiddies. My daughter loves Dora.
B00CL2H1U2|5|My Godson loves this he is 9 months
B00HES8YRM|1|No bmw cup was sent!!!
B005VT88Y0|4|I suffer from MPS (messy purse syndrome) I needed to get it under control... so I purchased this little ditty. Its compact, so it can fit in smaller and larger purses AND its pretty stiff, so its easy to grab. As little as it is, it fit all my essentials and leaves room in my bigger purse for my commute items. This is a great buy.... I just didn't put five stars because there's no handles. Easy to grab, but clearly- handles might have been a nice touch. If I can't tackle my MPS now, its just all on me.
B002WN2ASI|2|This toy is awful, the ties are at the bottom, so if you want it in a crib plan on it being upside down.  Not only that, the stitching is odd, the shapes don't really fit in the places they should go.  Since it can't really hang in crib I tried to get my daughter to play with it outside the crib, but no dice.  She does't pay it any attention at all.  As a toy it isn't really up to par.  It was kind of expensive for the poor quality!
B006Z2C032|5|Love it! Absolutely love this crib. A full size crib that was given to us was far too big for our tiny nursery. After searching I came upon this one. It was delivered within the 2 days promised (with Prime) and was in great condition. I just love it. It fits in perfectly and goes very well with our already purchased change table/dresser. Very pleased
B0016A7QYQ|3|It's washcloths and thick, but somehow they made it rough...It hurts my son's skin when we try to use it as burping cloths or try to use it to wipe his mouth.
B00000ISOY|2|cute little toy kit with general tools fo the medical profession represented in kids size format. ok for the under 6 set.
B00EL8S3TW|5|So far we love this moniter. I love that I can communicate with my daughter in middle of the night if she needs something. We use it for an older child that has seizures. Temperature sensor is a cool feature. Works great so far. We've had it for a month.
B004F0930Y|5|This straw cup really is leak proof.  The pieces fit together nicely, and unlike some other cups, they are not difficult to put together.  After trying several different cups, I think this is the best one around.  Unfortunately, I think Munchkin may have discontinued them -- at least the sesame street themed cups, as they're getting more and more difficult to find.
B000069RAO|3|I didn't like it for nursing.  I could never get it to sit right or feel comfortable using it.  However, my daughter used it a lot as a back rest when she was learning to sit up and likes to use it now (at 22 months old) for watching t.v. or playing with her dolls.  I'd suggest trying it out in the store to see if you like it before spending the $$.
B002ITOC7S|5|My son was born eight weeks early and spent a month in the hospital. While there he had a few apnea episodes. The doctors assured me it was a&#34;premiee thing&#34; that he would outgrow. And although he did,  this monitor gives me piece of mind. Before I bought this product I found myself checking on the baby every five minutes. There's only been one false alarm when I first bought it and didn't put it on snug enough. The alarm is very loud! I feel much better having this on my son every night.and it has a warranty for a year. The chance on sids after a year is rare.
B0038JDVBK|5|OXO does it again with thoughtfully designed products that really serve well. the soft bristles slip in and out of bottles without spraying water everywhere (like the Munchkin version). The stand is convenient and drains water. And the bottle tip that's hidden inside the handle is soft enough to actually use and drains as well (again the Munchkin bottle brush fails here.) I will definitely stay loyal to this model!
B00DYOQQDE|5|Great product.
B002BY2LF0|5|I will not use any other pacifier for my baby! Not only does it help with breast feeding babies, but it is reassuring to know how safely the product is made - and the components of the pacifier. Will be ordering more! :)
B00I3YFHSU|5|This stroller is a god send! I travel with my family quite frequently and before the Nano I found myself either checking our stroller or leaving our umbrella stroller plane side. I can tell you on more than one occasion that my previous umbrella would come back scuffed up and I once had a part break off of it.  The Nano will fit into the overhead bin of most planes that are 737's or larger. When I fly on regional jets I do need to leave the stroller plane side but it comes with a very handy travel bag that I can wrap the stroller up in and it protects it well.    As for the functionality of the stroller, it is a two hand fold but folds very easily and is so compact. The stroller pushes well and has actual nice tires as opposed to most umbrellas that tend to have those double plastic wheels...you guys know what I am talking about. The recline is pretty ample for a young one to snooze and it seems pretty comfortable. I only used it with a car seat a few times but it was fantastic that it even worked with my car seat as most compact strollers don't...let alone do it without having to buy any additional hardware.     I really don't have any cons on this stroller as it truly is a unique stroller out on the marketplace and one that is useful not only for travel but also for everyday use as it stores so compact.
B003KEMMNG|4|My daughter flops all over the place, so when we bought her a big girl twin bed, we needed something to keep her in it at night. She tosses and turns a LOT during the night. These work great. The only complaint I have is they have a strong smell to them initially. We aired them out for a few days and they're fine now. Work great to keep her in bed, but we love the fact she can climb into and out of bed still.
B006I0R8GA|1|As a first time mom, I wanted a black and white mobile with faces as I read that this is what young babies notice best.  This toy offered hours of frustration as my son would want to look at it if he was anywhere near it, but then would start crying soon after looking at it as it was too much...  Babies can be happy looking at a shadow on the wall or the ceiling light.  In fact, sometimes they do not want to look at anything.  This toy does not leave them this option as it is too engaging.
B004DFO57M|5|After my daughter was born, just like any other first-time parent I dreaded the task of cutting her nails. I got several different clippers made for babies but never felt comfortable using them on her tiny fingers. These scissors, however, are perfect for the job: the handles are comfortable, the tips are security rounded to prevent accidents and, the curve of the blades makes it easy to snip the nails cleanly and quickly. I now recommend these to all of my friends with babies.
B000JVXZF2|5|Works great for traveling with my 11 month old when we go out of town to visit friends/relatives.
B000JVVXOM|4|My son has had no pinching issues and is almost 3. The thing I mainly use this for is for him to sit on and watch TV and hopefully go potty. He will sit there for a long time and has no issues with the size. He is 36 pounds too, so he's not super tiny.    It doesn't latch, but it hasn't been an issue for us. I love the idea of putting the one part on the potty to make the large potty fit him better....and the base will be a nice stool--it has great non-slip grips.
B008J3UD2U|4|wish they would stay up on the back
B003LEN7TI|5|This kit was simple, and easy to use! Love the way it turned out :)
B007SRMHPO|4|Great cooler bag
B009ICN71K|1|didnt receivethis product<br />all the items in the box was ok but missing this one
B000SBIMTM|5|Very good these bottles!  I suggest them to all the parents who need to feed their children while they are being breastfed!
B0090OM1F4|3|I bought these as I want my 4 month old to have bows to wear but I am not a fan of the huge ones that cover the entire head. These are very cute and petite and have a very nice sheen to the band. They fit well and do not leave a mark. My complaint is when it comes to the packaging. They are all shoved in a small bag and so many of them are smashed. I have tried to get them to look right but I can't completly fix them all and it just makes them look silly and cheap. The amount you get for the $ is great but when half of them are smashed and creased, it turns out to be not so great of a deal...
B005ZBI03I|5|This seat works great for our son - we have one at home & one at Nana's.  It suctions to both toilets (one is round, one is oval) no problem, although it sometimes slides on the oval toilet.  It is very easy to clean - just wipe with a Clorox wipe after use.  We haven't had any issues of the product cracking or ripping as other reviewers have mentioned.
B0054HSVGE|5|So far this mattress is holding up nicely and it seems to be very comfortable, it is much nicer then my daughters last mattress. There isn't a huge difference between the two sides but still a great buy.
B000A7V1EM|5|This Lil hi hair has made our life soooo much easier!!! Especially at the lake when our Lil girl likes to sit at the picknik table like everyone else!
B001EQCVU6|5|Although I didn't purchase this market sling for myself, I wish I'd had one when my baby was born.  I am sure it will be well used by the new Momma who received it.  It's very well made (fully lined), the colors and design are boho chic and it will keep baby close and snug at all times.
B005WHQKEG|5|Very nice. I'm a big researcher when it comes to anything for my child and Graco had all the great reviews and features I was looking for. I bought this for my mom when she keeps my daughter. It's very plush and I feel my daughter is secure. Easy to install. Hard to unhook the buckle the first couple times but works great now. I have another more expensive Graco car seat that I love just as well. I didn't buy this one for myself because I like the bigger head support and the built in cup holder on the other one. The cup holder on this one is attachable. The only problem I have is the head/back rest slides down and I have to pull it up every time I put her in it. But over all I love Graco car seats.
B00MHP2BI0|5|great product
B003HS5JMQ|5|Super cute. Great quality material.
B0000645DP|1|We have had this monitor for 3 months now and the static did get annoying at times but as long as you adjusted the receiver, it would stop.  Then one morning at 4am the reciever started screaming and it never worked the same again!  I tried changing the batteries and it continued to do the same thing.  Nothing I tried worked.  I am now looking for a new monitor and will let everyone I know NOT to buy this monitor!
B002UXQRNE|5|Perfect for little hands! Inexpensive, durable,functional, however I recommend handwashing. The dishwasher or detergent does something funky to the handles.
B0015YLZ7W|5|I have this set, along with three \\"spare\\" bibs (so 6 cloth bibs and one crumb catcher in total)<br />It's fantastic. You wrap everything up and close it inside the crumb catcher, including your spoons. It keeps everything together, it keeps the inside of your diaper bag organized and clean.<br />I mean, this is just brilliant.<br />The cloth bibs are plastic backed, so nothing leaks through. They close with a velcro closure, rather than snap, which is my *only* flaw. Little kids get pretty clever at yanking until the velcro gives out. However, the velcro is very sturdy and holds tight.<br />I purchase these for baby shower gifts now. Love 'em!
B003SRL9WU|3|These are nice and specific for dr Brown bottles BUT the Evenflow brand cost significantly less. They fit and cost, on average, $2 a piece at your local baby store. No need to pay $15 for the Dr Brown label. Not worth the money.
B003084LP4|5|This is the best convertible car seat ever!  Very comfortable and extremely easy to set up...just follow the manual, which also is available on the company's website on PDF (for the tech pepople).  We also bought a Britax and returned it because it did not recline and was very stiff and uncomfortable.  This is forward and backward facing, reclines etc!  The first time we opened the box and took out the carseat, our daughter sat in it after we removed the wrapping on the kitchen floor and refused to leave her \\"chair\\" that night, and fell asleep in it.  We are Maxi Cosi buyers and decide to give something else a try and it did not work!  We are back to the Maxi Cosi brand because Dorel makes the best products for babies and kids period.  We bought the infant seat and the Quinny and we are not regretful, besides the colors are great and the side protection is a safety feature that is necessary!  Excellent purchase, the only drawback is that the toddler seat does not snap into the quinny...kidding! Yes, she is growing up...sigh!
B002RT93VE|5|This was a baby shower gift for a mother expecting twins. She loves it and uses it all the time.
B0028K2RME|2|I really wanted this to work.  I liked that it was covered in fabric as to reduce my babies exposure to too many plastic things.  It is very attractive and seems like a great idea in theory.  Despite reading all the negative reviews about the volume being too low, I went ahead and purchased it at a store so that I would be able to return it easily.  I needed something for the pack n play.  I hung some toys on the arch but somehow it just didn't have the same effect as my baby's [[ASIN:B000FFL58Q Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym]] in which he squeals with delight.  I needed something musical with lights.  The piano comes with ties so I had to velcro it to the pack n play.  The baby has no idea what the kicking does and the music is so low that it is really pointless.  The funny thing is that I had his [[ASIN:B007Z0JBM6 Baby Einstein Discover and Play Piano]] and [[ASIN:B000YDDF6O Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes]] right there in the crib and they were astonishing loud compared to the kick piano.  I was hoping that at least the the lights on top would attract his interest but sadly no.  I looked at all the musical toys I bought and looked at the kick piano and thought \\"What is the point of this? It doesn't do anything!\\", so I returned it.  It would have been perfect if the volume was louder.  Why, Fisher Price, Why? Something so simple that can be easily fixed remains a mystery.
B00068O22S|5|While I hate having anything on my stove these have been wonderful.  They help keep our little one, who was able to turn on the gas on our stove, safe.  Honestly this was not something I had even considered needing until our little guy showed us what he could do.
B00081L2SU|5|Item was delivered on time,the product is made from strong materials,and this Mommy's Helper is indeed a helper,my Wife thanked me for getting it for Her,my Son have freedom to walk in the Supermarket,but my Wife have total control on how far He can go,great tools for Moms.
B001V9MBUG|5|For women looking to be eco-friendly in this aspect of their life, this is a great product. I use these on a day I would otherwise use a pantyliner. Probably not enough support for heavier days.
B003JJX2IG|4|These potty cover seats are fantastic! My only complaint is that they don't stick to the seat, so I have to hold down the back with my foot while I place my son on the toilet so they don't slip off. Other than that, they are great. Makes public restrooms much easier.
B00440CZPU|5|Great size, easy to clean, convenient because they are both microwave and dishwasher safe.  Overall a great product to store baby food!
B000HK6BCE|2|Spare yourself the trouble and pay $10 more for the Summer double rails. I NEVER write reviews but want to warn you that the Regalo rails have TERRIBLE instructions, is difficult to assemble, with cheap mesh and is very short. There are TOO many components in assembling this item and when you pull the mesh to attach to the poles, the sides start to rip. When assembled and placed under the full mattress, there is only about six inches of safety and if you have an active baby they can easily fall off the sides.     If you have a twin bed, then perhaps the rails will do a better job.     I purchased this item wanting to save money but have learned my lesson. I am going to order the SUMMER rails which we purchased for my daughter but cost $10 more. The Summer rails assemble in 5 minutes with a handful of steps and is extremely safe and durable.
B000HIP352|5|Bought two for gifts.  Both couples say they love it.
B004NRNSZK|4|We had a bumbo and my baby loved sitting in it, but my chunky thighed little girl quickly outgrew it. We should have just purchased the bebepod, they're very similar, but the bebepod is definitely better. The main difference we were looking for is the bebepod has wider leg openings. She outgrew the bumbo at 4 months, but at 14 months, she can still fit the bebepod. The bebepod also comes with straps that you can use to attach it to chair to use as a high chair. The tray is easy to attach and take off. My daughter loves to play the toy that attaches to it.<br /><br />My only small complaint is the place mat. The watermelon is super cute, but has significantly faded after being washed with a sponge. It also dries curved, not flat, making it difficult to sit flat when placed in the tray. My daughter sees this hole  and immediately tries to pick it up, sending the food flying off the tray. I would just not use the place mat, however, there is a hole in the tray where the toy fits and food gets stuck in this hole making it annoying to clean. Since she's already learned to sit and this isn't the best \\"high chair\\", we've finally retired this chair.<br /><br />But overall, a good little chair to keep your little one in a safe spot while they are learning to sit.
B000AHJKB8|4|Bought these for my 8 month old grandson who loved them all (except for the photo album). Simple messages, bright colors and washable pages add up to a nice collection at a reasonable price.  He especially loved the book with lift-up flaps and a mirror at the end.  The one with the teether is cute, too.
B008R1B01W|5|Great product!
B00BJMXKVO|5|This is our fifth type of baby gate, and far and away OUR FAVORITE!  The foot controls are awesome and amazing.  Even my 3 year old can't open the gate - this is the first one she can't operate.  Installation was also among the easiest I've encountered.  I highly recommend it.
B000VAI4PC|3|Product works fine in my bathtub.  Do beware that this product is being shipped from overseas.  It took close to two months for me to receive.  There is a small window of time where the bath seat works for your child.  I spent half of it waiting for it to arrive.
B004AHMCKA|5|This is one of my baby's favorite toys. She will sit on my lap and play with it for a while, and I also suction it to her high chair and she will play with it for a while there. She is fascinated when I spin it for her.
B004GCJMLG|5|I love these locks.  They are awesome.  Very quick and easy installation compared to other safety locks.  We keep the key hung in a central location above our son's reach.
B001OC5UNK|5|Great for helping me keep my 2 year old son in one place (and out of things) when I have a lot to do.
B005VKG32S|5|Cute. Using them on my two month old.
B00081L2SU|2|I love the idea of this, but it wasn't ideal.  I bought them for my twins who were 15 months at the time.  I have one twin bigger than the other (32 lbs and the other 28 lbs).  The harness fits on my smaller twin but doesn't fit around the torso of my bigger twin.  My second issue with this harness is that the harness tethers in the back supposedly between the shoulder blades but the adjustable shoulder straps are so long that there is all this extra shoulder strap material getting in the way of the harness hook loop in the back.  Sometimes (like when I'm boarding a plane) I'm walking ahead holding one twin and need to pull the other twin behind me so it would be nice if there also was a harness hook in the front.  It is a strong harness when it fits though.
B000056OWC|1|I agree with all of the reviews I see written here. I am online now searching for another bathtub for my six-month old. I've been using a big baby sponge under her while she's in it since she was born, which is nice and soft for her head.<br />She is too long now to be conmfortable and wants to sit up, but it doesn't look right when you set it up in the sitting position. It looks like her head would flop forward and she would have no back support. It has only ONE stage...not four!<br />She scraped her toe on the plastic piece under the yellow spin-toy yesterday and started crying, which she never does in the bath.  :(<br />The suction cups don't work very well and the tub is too big for my counter. I'm buying a new one!
B009X4C3QS|5|very good~
B000IDSLOG|1|If this toy is such a choking hazard, PLEASE report it so others will not put their children in danger.    Google \\"Safer Products Gov\\" (it's a part of the Consumer Product Safety Commission) and click on \\"Report an unsafe product\\" so that a recall can be made if necessary.
B00009VE6W|3|I was really into this wrap when I saw someone wearing it.  I looked so comfortable.  I received it as a baby shower gift.  I have worn it about 4 times.  It is a real pain to put it on because it's very long and very stretchy.  Although, it was easy to learn to put it on, it is not a quick process.  I especially don't like that when I get out of the car to put it on, the ends drag on the floor until I get it all wrapped up.  If I know I'm going to be out for a while, I'll just put it on at home.      However, once I have it on, it is so comfortable and I feel like my baby (3 weeks old) is very comfortable in it.  The most comfortable fit and the one that feels the safest is tummy to tummy.   It's extremely easy to get the baby in and out of it and I love that feature.  I like how close the baby is to me and that it feels more like I'm carrying her than the Baby Bjorn does.  But the Baby Bjorn is so much quicker to put on, however, not as easy for me to get the baby out of it.      12/27/04 After my initial review,  My baby seems to HATE the wrap whenever she's awake (she's now  2 1/2 months).  I have tried to use it almost everyday because I really like it.    I have tried using it to calm her down at night and she fights against it, like it's too tight.  If she's already asleep though, it's not a problem.  In addition, I have tried to nurse her while wearing it and it is difficult to do.  Her nose gets all smooshed up against my breast and she can't breath.  I have to get her head out of it which defeats the purpose of \\"discreet\\" nursing.  Also, if you're wearing one of those nursing tops that you have to lift up, you can forget about it.  You absolutely have to wear one that opens on the side.  I have passed the 30 day return period, but I think I will keep it for when she is older and can maybe use it in the other positions: hip carry, forward facing and back carry.     One more thing: although this was great for my shoulders, my lower back hurts alot after I wear this.  It definitely doesn't offer any back support for me.   The baby bjorn seems to offer more support for me in this area.     6/25/06: Just an update.  I never did get around to using the wrap in the other positions because I discovered the Over the Shoulder Baby Holder.  It's a sling.  Not very stylish, but it was the absolute best thing I have used.  My daughter is 3 months away from her 2nd birthday and I still use it to carry her on my hip.  I know that most young mothers want something more hip and slylish, but in terms of comfort, a traditional sling takes the cake.  I have had no shoulder or back problems using this.  I've also used a pocket sling and loved that for it's compactness and availbility in cool fabrics, but I found I had to keep upsizing as the baby got older so that she and I would both fit in it.
B003IXTQOC|3|I was really enjoying this product, but after about a dozen uses the elastic started coming out, will have to retire it now. Not sure if I want to buy another if they can't last longer.
B00GJBZQOO|4|My baby and I love it :-)
B0055DXEHI|5|When baby hit 3 months she turned into a drool machine. Most of the bibs I had were those little cheapos that are made of some thin synthetic fabric that soaks through right away. I searched amazon for the best bibs for droolers and picked a few with decent reviews to try:<br /><br />aden + anais 3 Pack Nibble Snap Bibs<br />Imse Vimse Organic Cotton Terry Dribble Bibs<br />Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding Bib<br /><br />Baby is now 7 months and the drooling is gone, so we're not using bibs much at the moment. When I was using them, I liked the aden and anais best.<br /><br />The Imse Vimse are very small which would have been fine for my purpose and they had the nicest colors to me- fairly neutral so they went with most outfits. They also fit nice and snug around the neck due to the tie. The bib cotton was thick and absorbent, but I rarely used them because the edging is made with some terrible rough fabric. If it's cotton, they must be breeding a new special type with the texture of... gosh, I'm trying to think of a fabric with such a terrible texture, but I don't know what it would be. Suffice it to say that it doesn't belong in the sensitive neck rolls of a little baby. So, these got very little use.<br /><br />The Tommy Tippy are nice and probably well suited to keeping milk out of the neck rolls, but the bib itself is a thin synthetic material and not all that absorbent. So, they soak through too quickly to be of much use for a serious drooling problem. The bib size is perfect, not tiny like the Imse Vimse and not huge like Aden and Anais. I don't love the velcro- you have to be careful that it doesn't snag other things in the wash and if you don't line it up perfectly it can irritate baby's skin. The snaps on Aden and Anais are better.<br /><br />Finally, my favorite ended up being the Aden and Anais which are designed for eating, not drooling. They are huge, more of a smock on a 3 month old, but this is perfect for an eating bib. At three months baby wasn't mobile yet, so being too large was no biggie- if I need to resume use, it may interfere with her crawling as they hang past the waist. They were also a big big around the neck for little one but we didn't seem to have a big problem with the drool running into her neck so this worked out ok. The reason I loved them is that they are so soft and so absorbent, they never soaked through with the drool and I could take the long bib and wipe her face with it. The Imse Vimse were too small for this and the Tommy Tippy not absorbent enough. Another possible advantage is the rather loud pattern does not show stains as much as the plainer bibs. I do wish they came in more color options, I don't love either choice, but on the whole I am happy and I know these will last forever, like the Aden and Anais blankets, they just get better with washing.
B0009EXN10|5|Great cup, does not leak at all :)
B003LSKVUW|4|I recorded my own voice singing the song over music. She presses the button to listen to me sing after I've said goodnight. She's 2 1/2... I wish this had been available when she was a baby!<br /><br />The only drawbacks are mechanical: it's rather loud, and also there was something wrong with the Play button on the first one I bought so I had to return it to Hallmark. But the second one is fine and I taped a bit of bubble wrap over the speaker (which is inside the star where she can't get to it).<br /><br />Update 2014: She's now 6 and still plays it at bedtime.
B000KJBFC8|5|Bought this for a long road trip. It worked well and definitely served it's purpose. I couldn't be any happier with the product! I wish there were more colors to choose from but that's a very minor detail at this point.
B00I0NKG2Q|3|I liked this for my sons crib
B000GK5XY2|2|This worked pretty well the first time with my 6.5 month old - he seemed to like it and was able to get a fair amount of banana through it. However, the mesh nets are not replaceable on this brand, unlike on some of the other brands (Sassy, Nuby, and BabySafe feeders). This is a major problem because eventually you will want to replace the net. It is just too hard to clean out all the goo since the net is permanent. I attempted to detach the net by pulling out the little plastic locking ring, but now it won't reattach fully. I think you're better off with one of the replaceable net systems. Also, a cap would be nice for on-the-go.
B001CFFX90|1|I do not like this item. It works ok if you dont put any weight on it. If you put too much weight on it then it pops right off the wall. I also think it would be nice if the platform was longer.
B00FCSCJB8|5|Great product and the best warranty out there. Love the included mesh bag that can be rolled and used whenever you need it. This I haven't seen on any other product. Fits big drinks and water bottles which helps out allot.
B00B7M7BN4|1|They were not what I expected
B000YDDF6O|5|This toy is so fascinating to babies. It really keeps them entertained.
B007OWLA10|5|Cutest shoes ever, bought the 7 as well, so we would have both to wear as he grows.  So cute!  Made well too!
B00217X8RW|4|Exactly what I needed for replacement parts. Tubes were a little hard to insert into pump but it should work. Package arrived very fast.
B00IAEHIXA|5|My 9 mos. old grandson loves this and loves to make it squeak.
B003IP8RRM|1|Well, at first it seemed like this was the answer to my 2 year old getting into the fridge, but all he had to do was pull hard on the door and the strap snapped.  Waste of money.
B00B1M2P7M|5|My little one loves to be swaddled and this sleep sack is perfect for that purpose. The cotton one is great for in the summer months when you want to wrap your baby in a blanket but not get too hot. I also love that it has instructions in the inside. This product is easy to use for those who aren't experts in the art of swaddling!
B00AGJFNCA|5|I love this mirror! my daughter just moved up to a front seating toddler chair and I could not see her at all with the standard car rearview mirror. This mirror latches on great (the bottom latches extend, which I figured out after a good minute of thinking it wouldn't fit). Now I can see my daughter and no more blind spots.
B003IHVHM2|5|Works awesome to help keep critters away from my strawberries in my deck planter while allowing sunlight and water in.
B005DEVS2C|4|This organizer was a great purchase. The fact that it's cloth helps protect the wood of our dresser/changer combo (since it's not plastic or a basket, which can leave scratches). It fits a good amount of diapers and the pockets hold our thermometer and A&D ointment nicely. My only complaint is that the elastic loops that hold the interior divider in place could be a bit tighter. They are a little loose on ours and the divider jiggles a little, but not enough to be a pain. All in all a great choice!
B00GJBZQOO|4|I was a little disappointed ,that it said it had a toy teether  I really thought they were soft, like a teething  ,were he can bite on it! But I still think it was cute! I love amazon, This might be a good idea,babys wont hit there mouth. Still great product Marie
B001668HEI|1|this Loop Rattles  is too small， and beyond my imagination.I don't buy it any more.<br />by the way, it is useless.
B00KGYOAII|5|I don't like that BOB accessories have to be purchased separately but I found this at a great price, arrived quickly, and works great for our double Bob.
B0044USDUQ|5|My kids adore these bags. I love them. Each kid has their own and they get so excited to pack them with their own snacks. Plus Im not wasting plastic bags- good for the environment!
B008QMZEY6|2|This lasted less than one school year and my son seldom packs a lunch. The side seam split.
B008EXOW0O|5|So far this is the only bottle my breastfed baby will take.  We gave her the avent natural about once a week from birth and at about 2 months she started refusing it.  After that we tried the playtex drop in latex and silicone nipple, comotomo, gerber first essentials, medela, avent sippy, and mam.<br /><br />Finally when we tried the adiri she latched on right away.  I think the big difference is that the nipple is shorter. She gagged on all the other bottles.<br /><br />The only issue we had was that she would take it for 15 minutes and only drink 1 oz. we tried the next size nipple - stage 1, and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The bottle did leak once - maybe not screwed on right? But being that this is the only bottle she would take at now 4.5 months I am thankful it exists and have to give it 5 stars!!!
B003NSAZWY|5|I ordered the grey elephant for my daughter and she LOVES it. She is 5 months old and loves to snuggle it against her face. It is easy to take with us in the car seat or stroller. It is so soft. I will definitely be ordering another one!
B00I0M8SWC|1|The spout cover thing is basically pressed up against my little ones nose as he sips but the worst part is that after hitting the floor this cup broke into pieces. The outside shattered off of the inside ಠ_ಠ<br /> At least I only paid $8 or 9 dollars at Babies R Us and not $18 for 2 on Amazon... ughhhh.<br />Back to searching for a good sippy cup &#62;:(
B004AE3GH6|5|One year and still in use, have to replace the nipples but still the bottles seems like new, now only use one or two at day but still by the prices I pay is a very good buy.
B002QYW8LW|5|My grandson is 6 months old and starting to teeth...he absolutely loves this teething banana (as we call it) it is suppose to be a toothbrush.  Multipurpose and works great!
B0088N4C8C|5|Great!
B0090OM1F4|5|I received so many compliments of this bow on my daughter. Love it.
B001DVR25G|4|This dresser was for our nursery and it is the perfect fit and quality for a baby/child room.  It would look odd in a master bedroom.  There were a lot of screws and probably more than anything we have ever self assembeled.  The wood color is true espresso and it matches our crib exactly from a high end baby furniture store.  I would recommend this and would purchase again.
B006I0R5AO|1|These bottles look like toy bottles; not what I was expecting. They are super tall and skinny- not shorter and more round as the picture makes it look. I bought this bottle because I have a very fussy baby and refuses bottles- but this does not have any vents so I am concerned that even if she did take it I would be dealing with gas/colic issues more than I already am.<br /><br />I already opened the bottle packaging- I would return if I could. I will never use these.
B004H1TD7E|5|Back when we were trying to introduce a bottle to our baby girl, she absolutely HATED any bottle we tried to give her.  I went through so many different kinds of bottles and nipples.  Finally I bought this on recommendation from a friend and for a while it was the ONLY bottle she would take.  I think it was the shape of the nipple that she liked.  Now, she'll take our regular Medela bottles but for a few weeks this was our go-to bottle.  My only complaint is the multiple pieces are kinda annoying to take apart and clean.  Other than that, it's a great bottle.
B00A0HS5I2|4|Activity mat is great, but activity table very disappointing kept falling apart.  Was looking forward to using it much longer.
B005WPPT54|5|I can't say how this bag will hold up since I haven't started using it yet but I love the look of the bag! It feels more like a purse than you're standard diaper bag. The inside is a nice lime green so it is perfect for carrying around with our baby boy! It seems very well made and I hope it will hold up well!
B00PLVFJVI|5|I received these blocks for a review in exchange for my honest opinion and am glad I did! My son loves them! They're not just the same old blocks. Not only do they have numbers on them to help with recognizing numbers, he can make different faces with them. This is great so he doesn't get tired of playing with them. A+
B000CSBOBO|5|I would recommend this product to everyone. My son adapted very well to using the potty seat. Much easier than the traditional potty trainer that tends to be a messy clean up.
B000A796WG|1|I've had it for a week and the plastic has started warping, so only two corners will make contact with the wall.  Prior to the warping it was not easy to use.  In fact, it was difficult to get it to expand and pretty much impossible to get it to lock in place.  I have already intiated the return process.  Save your money and time.
B00DC2URGK|4|My 18 month old nieces loves her little monkey! 1 star off because it is more like a stuffed toy than anything else, this is by no means a backpack. It is what the description calls its: a harness. The pocket is very small...just enough room for her cell phone - that really all that fits. Also I think the &#34;monkey tail&#34; strap at the bottom is a little awkward. But the function overall is great, it does what it needs to. The most important part is that my little niece likes it so much and will let us put it on her. Excellent value for the price.
B008K47U06|5|Awesome product!!
B00JRYS3FE|5|Easy car seat and comfortable for baby.
B00AIXLBLG|4|I put my wet bikini in it after a beach day. It works as a make up bag. Things can spill in it and it doesn't get all over clothes while traveling. Lots of uses.
B002XNGTUM|5|I've been looking for a cute replacement cover for my snoogle.  This is the only one I could find WITH A ZIPPER! If you've ever tried to put a cover on a snoogle that doesn't have a zipper, don't do it.  It takes forever, and it's a true pain in the butt.  This cover is nice cotton material, washes well, and goes on easy because of the zipper.
B009KE6UXS|1|The pieces were WAY too small for young kids. A big choking hazard. I am shocked this product is even on the market!
B00GN1RHYC|5|Very beautiful. Price is worth it too.
B00AKKDSNG|5|Maybe it's the sleep deprivation, because not a whole lot gets me this excited lately, but this does, so  I had to write a review of this crib.  First, they have fantastic customer service. They were able to change the shipping address last minute and were very accommodating and friendly. It was shipped in 3 days to the location. Second, this is just a great product. I did not notice any plastic odor like others had written about, so they must have corrected this issue.  The set up was super easy and you can follow the directions by pictures.  The pictures are easier to follow than IKEA furniture, if you've ever had to lose time off your life trying to figure out how to put something from IKEA together.  This is a very innovative product. The Lotus is like a 3D piece of origami, but it doesn't require acrobatic maneuvers to set up or take down.  I do wish the Lotus came with a sheet though.  I didn't realize that a sheet wasn't included so I had to wrap a sheet around the mattress, but that worked just fine. For the cost, an included sheet would be nice. It does meet airline carryon regulations and the backpack makes it easy to transport.  So far I've traveled with it several times.  Some people have complained about the mattress, but I don't think it's too hard.  It seems just right for an infant.  I could see once my child gets older that it may not be soft enough, but by then a child could sleep on top of a folded quilt or blanket for more padding.  I like the side zip as I can my infant back in at night more smoothly without waking him after he eats.  You feel kinda like a ninja. I actually bought the Lotus directly through the company's website since it was $20 less that way. They have a two week full refund policy. While it is more expensive than other travel cribs, its fold up feature will save you money in the long run if you carry it on a plane - that savings adds up quickly.
B00AKHKTVI|1|Preferably I would like to give this zero stars.  I spent hours trying to set this thing up.  I have been a computer tech for 15 years and was unable to set it up.  I called in reinforcements and it took 2 friends before I found someone who could set it up.  Once setup, I had to purchase an app for my android phone $4.  Then found that my FPS was erratic and ranged from poor to terrible.  Lately my wife's iPhone just won't connect while all the computers and androids are fine. Well, &#34;working&#34;.  I have since purchased a Foscam security camera and it is easy and wonderful.  Also only cost me $65.
B004ZWRG10|5|Very fast delivery! Looking forward to trying this out. Looks very well made! Appears to be a very good price for a very good product!
B00MYQROUW|3|Still trying to figure it out. When my child falls asleep its hard to keep her head stable on the side of the car seat. I tried the incline/recline, but it doesnt make a difference. I am still learning how to use this product. It looks good though, seems structurally sound, just want to get the head rest part working for us.
B00PY2QYBI|5|Love the HALO SleepSack!! We have one in fleece for the cooler months and decided to get a cotton one for the warmer months. It fits great and keeps my baby comfortable all night long!
B002F9MV88|3|These bibs are definitely made very cheap.  Don't expect to last too long. It started fraying after the first wash.  They are not waterproof as they claim.
B00MHTBUUQ|1|I ordered this thinking it would work perfect next to our downstairs changing table. Sadly, that did not work out and I ended up returning the product. The pieces they use to create the little shelves are just a very weak ( not even as strong as the cardboard it came in) pieces of a cardboard type material. The shelves certainly can't hold a wipes container or really anything else for that matter. While it looks like a great idea, overall, it was a disappointment for me.
B000G82HAW|3|This book has the things you'd want in it.  It is however, very simple.  There are really just words and lines on each page.  If you want to go minimal and as simple as you can, this book is for you.  I was looking for something with a little more character.  The footprint idea is a great one but the book itself is not overwhelming.
B00P4XL1LU|5|would buy again
B00L88YLQ2|5|Nice quality and fits rocker perfectly.
B004K38FNM|5|My son never slept well in his portable crib until we bought this. It certainly makes traveling with a toddler much easier since he will now sleep on the softer surface.
B0045I6IA4|5|Very good
B00GHO7NMG|5|Love these! Soft and cuddly with cute patterns. Colors are still bright after multiple washes.
B000NZQO52|4|I had one of these once before. Neat inexpensive camera setup. Although I meant to purchase something with night vision.
B000K53UEI|1|I cannot believe this has been rated so well.  Are people getting paid to rate it well?  I can't understand how else they would approve.  It's so flimsy and junky.  The stand often collapses on itself and the sticks pull right out of place.  It's really really really not worth the purchase.  Save yourself the hassle.  I couldn't give mine away for free.
B00I5P7IES|4|This looks great on my wall right when you come in my front door. Just take your time putting it up. All one piece and some letters ripped. Luckily they were easy to repair. Great buy :)
B006SFUCV8|5|I am on my second child and I wish I would have had this drying rack for my first! It keeps the bottles dry and organized. It doesn't take up too much space on the counter, but seems to hold plenty of bottles. It makes life easier.
B00KU1127Y|4|Nothing too fancy.. but good sound, range is real nice (even in a town house!!). I also wish it had rechargeable batteries but eh, no biggie i can just buy and use some of my own.<br /><br />Its good for purse or pocket sized and i did drop it down the steps n works just fine. Time will tell how it stands up but so far - great buy.
B0009QYTIY|5|nice
B006ZVV0NO|4|Yes, they work to block the sun out of my little divas eyes who made my driving trips very difficult because she could not stand the sun in her diva face! Lol!!!
B0042D69V0|5|We bought this for our Grandson for Christmas and he loves it.  It is so much fun to watch him bounce and strengthen his legs. He laughs and just has a great time every time he is in it.
B005CBETVI|5|This product is extremely well made and looks like it will last serving every sibling a family might have.  Definitely recommended.
B00AA6LU1C|4|hamper was really nice. very sturdy and matched the room perfectly. it holds a lot of clothes also
B004DM57A4|4|Really cute chair. It shows dirt really easy, but pretty well made.
B00AXSQAEY|5|Very useful for use around the house. Comes with everything you need to get started and pumping<br /><br />One drawback in my opinion is that the pump itself isn't really meant to be used out of the bag. So your really kinda stuck carrying the bag.
B001D475FU|5|I use this product at least 3 times a day to sanitize pacifiers and all bottle parts.  It is extremely easy to use and much more cost effective than the sterelizer bags.  I wish we had purchased it sooner.
B00BV0ETJ6|4|Worked well and didn't leak. Nice and convenient travel sippy cup. Fits into any cup holder and it's nice that you can close it so that the straw doesn't get dirty or spill.
B00DCR5EKE|5|EXCELLENT GATE! So glad I read reviews and purchased this gate! Easy to install and easy to use!! I can easily open it with one hand while holding my son. I will say the lock does start to stick after about a week but as long as you check it before waking away it's not a big deal. Nice sturdy gate. I'd buy it again if I needed another.
B004FPYG7O|5|I really like this spout cup. I would recommend this product for any parent wanting to transition baby from bottle to cup.
B000XT30G4|5|Beautiful gate and very sturdy.  Good height.  Dont think my boxer will will be able to jump over it.  Overall, better than I expected.
B008TML9AQ|5|It is perfect, beautiful, good quality and comfortable for baby and for parents, you do not have to stand up, you can rock the bassinet or check out your baby from your bed. Es perfecta, con estilo, bonita y comoda para el bebe y para la mama. El colchon es comodo suave y puedes moverla con la mano sin tener que levantarte de la cama.
B00GULB10Q|5|The blue color is stunning! it really looks like that in person! Its easy to install, and is perfect for people who need a rear facing convertible seat as its not expensive.
B00AKXQCNG|4|I thought it was bigger, it was very nice on the wall, my kids loved it, but I wanted to get them bigger.
B004DM57A4|5|so far I am pleased. It is more adorable in person in person than appears on the picture. The colors are so bright and vibrant. My 2 year old likes it. i have not taken it out the plastic yet, because I purchased it for a christmas gift hope all remains well!
B00HUWRTVE|5|So cute and practical too. This will last beyond the need for a teething toy!
B000058DM5|5|I knew from other experienced moms that the Bjorn was the only useful and well-designed carrier.   It's easy to use, adjust and wash.  Luckily I never wasted my money on cheaper carriers, because I got to hear my friends complain about the others and rave about the Bjorn.  When my daughter was a newborn, she faced me in the Bjorn and fell asleep almost every time.  This was a big deal because she was a very fussy baby with acid reflux.  It was very, very hard for her to soothe, calm and fall asleep.  When she got to be around 3-4 months, we turned her around so she faced out.  She loved that!  She would also doze off forward-facing as well.  She also enjoyed looking out at the world when we went for short walks or through a store.   Often we stashed the Bjorn in the basket of the stroller.  Sometimes half way through a walk, she would scream to get out of the stroller and instantly settle down when she got into the Bjorn. My husband, who is 6'2&quot; also enjoyed using the Bjorn.  We used the Bjorn until our daughter was about 9 months.  After that, she was a bit long so it was getting too awkward.  I'd recommend getting the style with the longer straps if you are particularly tall.  I didn't know that another size existed when I registered for it.  It was fine for me, but longer straps would have been helpful for my husband.  No matter how long you use it, you'll love it.
B002UD660S|5|This pad has come in very handy, especially when my baby has a blow out or decides to go while we're changing her. It saves a little bit of laundry by protecting the changing pad cover. I especially like this particular pattern and color (Ecru) since stains do not show up very well. This pad is easy to clean and is holding up well after three months of use thus far. If I could do it over again, I'd buy more of these in the bassinet size and skip the lap pads, which I've found are too small.
B0000DEW8N|5|Most of the time, my advise to new mom's is to take in all the advice you get and then pick and choose the pieces that work for you and your family...except for this seat!  This is the most cost effective, useful purchase I have made for my baby.  When I started thinking about a high chair or seat for starting solids, I evaluated what I thought my approach to solid food would be and what I wanted for my baby girl.  I decided not to start solids until she could sit on her own and was showing signs of readiness.  In addition to that, I had heard from many friends and families that babies usually hate high chairs.  Why would I want to spend a lot of money on a chair my baby could hate sitting in?  Food is a huge part of our family so I wanted something useful that she would enjoy.  I decided to go with this chair because of the many good reviews it receives and the very low cost.  It was the best choice I could have made.  We use this chair at home so my daughter can be a part of regular meal times and not feel apart from the family.  We also take it to restaurants and receive lots of compliments from staff and other guests.  It is so nice to cover the messy tray up with the cover and take it home to wash instead of making sure everything is cleaned up at the restaurant.  It is even small enough to stick in the car and take to Grandma's house when we travel.  This is probably going to be my baby shower gift of choice for a good long time!  If you are looking for a high chair alternative LOOK NO FURTHER!  This is the seat you want!
B009UPUOVG|4|I liked this gate a lot, but for double the price of the normal munchkin gates without the tripguard, I don't think it was worth it. It isn't that much lower than the standard bar on the munchkin gates. The only nice thing that it has going for it is that the bar is tapered on the sides so it is easier to pass your foot over it without tripping (the purpose of this gate). I wish munchkin had integrated the easy close opening/closing mechanism that the munchkin easy close safety gate has. This one, you press the buttons and push down, which I find mildly annoying.
B00HV5VCKY|3|I loved this stroller when it first came & after using it for a few minutes it seemed okay.  It pushes easily, folds nicely & fits well in the back of my car.  The front tires, however, are so annoying I have almost thrown it away - several times.  The wheels stick & will NOT roll.  You have to use your foot or hand to push them in line with the rest of the wheels so it will move again.  And if you are going anything but straight, you spend most of your time trying to fix the wheels.  SO frustrating!
B000BFSMD6|5|I read all these reviews and finally decided to take the risk and give it a try. It works great! My 17 month old used just plain cloth bibs when he eats, and you know what happened - food everywhere. When I tried this on him, at first he didn't like it. But I played with him and put food in there and played picaboo a little, then he got used to it very quickly after 2 meals. Now it works great - soft, easy to clean up and saved a lot of mess!
B002UD65SG|5|We love it and so does our baby.  I recommend it so very much.  Fit great and easy to change
B00FZGZHO8|5|These wipes are just the right size and thickness... and they smell good to boot!!  The pouch seals easily and keeps them moist to the last one.  I turn my package on its head so that the moisture will be toward the top.  I found the bottom wipes to be extra moist when I didn't... soooo to make it nicer for all wipes - Topsy Turvy they are...
B005A3LYNE|3|This does not hold up well to rough play. After 3 days, all but one button had stop working. Very cheap.
B004A15YSS|5|Got this for my grand daughter. They absolutely love the crib.
B0001IU5HY|5|This swing is the absolute best!  Hands down.  Loved the swing when I saw it, and purchsed it.  Loved it even more when I would watch my little girl watch the birds go around above her and she would fall asleep.  Nothing better than having your baby be calm and content with their surroundings.  I wanted the papasan bouncer also, though the more I looked into it....it doesn't bounce!  It's not like the other bouncers.  The swing though is the best by far.
B001ENY02G|5|Worked perfectly with our uppababy vista bassinet. I am so glad I didn't buy a more expensive version - this was easy to assemble, sturdy & looked nice
B007ZZCQLY|3|The only factor - I was disappointed with the size of the boxes with lids. In the pic they look large but actually they are small cubes. Hoped to store toys and stuffed animals.... not so much.
B008OIYZZQ|5|Very soft and fits the mattress well.
B00BCDDZSI|5|I'm told this dresser is well made. The parents to be love it. The color and style are exactly what they expected.
B00004TFLB|5|This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.<br /><br />This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.
B00OKYK0JI|5|The case Was small but she loved it!
B0060SGW7Q|3|My girl is almost 12 months old and her weight is 11KG. this product is tight for her. not easy to wear
B00CSAWJPO|5|My son loves this chair. The feet can adjust to ensure it will fit under your table. It fits comfortably on our dining chairs as well. I haven't looked to see if it's possible, but I definitely will need to wash the straps that secure it to the chair. Otherwise, it's VERY easy to clean.
B00E9RMHD8|5|I have a huge house and i needed a reliable product to hear my baby anywhere! This was the one... I can hear her tossing and turning at the other end of the house! Super easy to use and amazing quality! I have been using it for almost 3 month now and couldnt have been happier with it.
B0034G5VC4|4|Each month has a place for you to fill out baby's sleeping patterns, feeding schedule, some sounds and motions they're making, what they like and dislike, favorite toys and games, and what they're learning by the end of the month. The pages and stickers are super duper cute while still being gender neutral. Nothing is plain, it all has some sort of colored pattern background and there are plenty of frogs, ducks, bugs, monkeys, turtles, and snails. The stickers are cute, though I wish there were even more of them, but that's ok.<br /><br />Inside:<br />All About Mommy & Daddy<br />All About You<br />Family Tree<br />Empty months that you fill in, and one page of stickers<br />Letters from Mommy & Daddy<br /><br />The only negative: (and why I gave 4 stars instead of 5)<br />Each month there's a box that says \\"(month)\\", which is where you put that month's sticker (like \\"January\\"). Well, on the thirteenth month, the one that will be your child's first birthday, they still wrote \\"month\\" in the box... the problem being that they only gave you ONE sticker for each month... so you don't have a sticker for the 13th month, but you can't just write it in by hand either. You'll have to type it out on the computer and make your own sticker label for that month. I mean, that is totally doable; I just find it to be a lack of foresight on their part. If they would have just not written \\"(month)\\" in the box, then you could hand-write that month in yourself. But since they did write \\"(month)\\" you have to cover it up even though they didn't provide the sticker to do so.
B001OC5UMQ|1|Very unhappy, dissatisfied customer. This Gate did not work for me, but I<br />had only 3 DAYS to return it. Tried to return but not allowed. I will never<br />purchase anything from Amazon.com again. I will stick to reliable & dependable sites in the future such as QVC HSN Ebay who all allow returns. I'm stuck with this gate in the box I cannot use. The gate is filmsy & not secure & did not work for me. It's in the box never used & can not be returned. No more products from Amazon.com for me.
B000056OV0|5|I will not waste your time echoing all of the fabulous things that have been said about this tub by others before me.  I give it 5 stars - enough said.  Many of the reviews are from parents with very young babies.  I'd like to give a perspective from a Mom with an older baby:<br />I have used this tub since my son's very first bath.  He is now 18 months old and this is still the only tub that I've had to buy.  He still fits in it just fine, and I still use the lay back side to wash his hair.  Then we simply turn around to sit on the larger side to splash and play.  <br />If you're looking for a tub that will last you for the long haul, this is the tub for you. I'm not looking forward to giving up the security aspects of this tub when my son outgrows it.  I'll try to keep using it as long as I possibly can.
B004GXA6II|5|This is my favorite out of many brands i have tried. Its kinda like a diaper as in it keeps the wetness away and absorbes more than expected.    I have tried...  Medela- which didn't absorb as much as i hoped, kept the skin damp and was loud (paper sounds).Is really thin though.    Lansinoh- which was not bad probably 2nd choice but i liked the dryness the evenflo gave better.  Johnsons-was small but very thick for major leaking, the fibers would stick to the skin.  I used this along with a thin pad when i worked. because it was small i wanted a back up to cover the area as i moved around but because of the thickness i would not use for everyday.   Nuk-I would not recommend. There is no edge around it like most others so if you leak the pad may absorb it but it can run right through to the bottom of the pad and on your clothes. The others with the edge will keep absorbing instead of letting it run out the bottom. this is not shaped to fit the curve of the mother either.   cotton washable pad- It was thick, quiet and comfortable, but one letdown reflux went through the pad.  Evenflo- Absorbes great while keeping skin from being soaking in milk. Has a good edge to prevent the pad from leaking, is not really loud and fits my shape well.   Good luck!
B001PBFWMO|5|This is a must have for wee ones! I don't know how we did it before. My little one would never sit still for the ball sucker thing...No way. She is 7 months old and thinks this thing is alright. Still not crazy about getting her nose sucked, but she does not fight me anymore. I recommend this for anyone looking for the perfect gift for a baby shower...Even if it's not on the registry!
B0053Y2B6E|5|I bought this pail with the diaper rental service I was using. I was able to store 80 [[ASIN:B004FOWDKC OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen]] in this container. Now that I wash my own diapers, I use considerably fewer and just wash every few days. Size-wise, this is a solid choice. To contain the smell I use both [[ASIN:B000134XZE Citrus Circles Diaper Pail Deodorizing Disks]] (makes smell tolerable when you lift the lid) and [[ASIN:B0053YVD90 Odorless Cloth Diaper Pail Filters - 4 pack]] (allows the air to circulate out of the pail, without smelling up the whole room). The lid of this container has a compartment for each.<br /><br />The con? The lid has to be lifted with your hand-a pedal would be nice. But, as it is, maybe that is one less spring or feature to break. The lid is pretty heavy for that type of pail design.
B0028K2RME|5|My grand-daughter loves to go to sleep while listening to this kick and play piano.  Works like a charm every time.  I like that it<br />has two volume settings. The low setting is perfect for nap time and it lasts long enough to lull baby to sleep.
B0007V644S|5|I've purchased these a couple of times now, no, I don't have a baby, but I have two cats.  These work great for liter box cleaning, much easier to use than grocery store bags (which sometimes have holes in them, gross when putting liter in).  They tie up pretty nice & tight.  The only complaint is that once in a while it can be hard to open up the bag because the sides stick, but that isn't every bag, and is generally expected with plastic bags anyway.  For the price, totally worth buying again to keep next to the poop scoop!  I plan on continuing to buy these every few months as needed.  Heck, if I have a baby in a few years I'll probably keep buying these, and just buy more!
B009FRKXKG|1|ROBIN<br />My grandson was so excited to see the cot when he came as well as my granddaughter was to see that she to got an early &#34;Santa &#34; present. They Are made very well especially for grandchildren<br />Who don't  have seperat ebeds at their grandparents . My granddaughter petite. My grandson is a<br />Big guy and the cot is too short.  HE SLEPT ON THE COT DESPITE THAT THE COT WAS TOO SHORT.  IT WOULD REAKH HIS HEART IF SET IT BACK.  MAMAL WILL NOT BE DOING THAT. I just want to make others aware of the size.  They still love them.<br /><br />.
B000RFBW00|5|Perfect for my grandbaby
B000056OV0|4|This bathtub will get a lot of use for a long time. It is significantly bigger than I had expected and it may be hard to store when not in use.
B009PUWW0M|5|We just got this for my 5 month old and he loves it. I especially like that there are no electric toys or music-makers. My son loves turning himself around and playing with the toys. I also like that the toys are removable - haven't used that yet, but I can see that it's convenient. I thought it would take up a lot more space than it does. It was easy to assemble.
B004K6VCI4|4|We just got this today and my initial impressions are: 1. Hanna color is RED not PINK, definitely disappointed about that. 2. Wish it had cup holders. This may seem stupid but to a 3 year old, it's huge. 3. We're used to Britax and install took a little while because the latch is different, kind of side ways, but we did get a very secure latch on our 2010 Honda Pilot. 4. Very comfortable. That was a big selling point of the Frontier 85 for us. 5. We are able to fasten our daughter more securely in this that in the Frontier 85, so that's what sold us on this. I ordered it half expecting to return it, but after seeing how she buckled in this compared to the Britax, our decision was made. 6. I wish the harness straps were a little thicker.     I'll update as time goes on, but so far so good!
B00KTYXF22|5|Baby loves it. The Owl jingles softly and all tags seem very secure.
B00006966I|3|Love the bottle. But my son sucked for 5 minutes before I realized he wasn't getting ANYTHING out of the stage 1 nipple. Even month's later, when I decided to give the nipple another shot, he BARELY got anything out. And the stage 2 nipple was still way too fast for him. I use Gerber nipples with this bottle, despite the fact that they leak a tiny bit (because Playtex designed this bottle to not support any other kind of nipple but their own). Playtex needs to get with the program and get a Stage 1 1/2 nipple, or something. I expected more from such a great name. But I still use the bottles because I invested the money in them. Now I'm just waiting for the day when he graduates to the stage 2 nipple...no more leaky substitute nipples.
B00AM5NTIS|5|Great product!  I did a lot of research before purchasing these pouches and I'm so glad to have found them. They are easy to fill, easy to clean, easy for the kids to hold, and so economical.  So much better for the earth as well!
B000P9TK0W|5|This pump does the job, but is tiring on your hands. It would be fine for only occassional use, but if you are going to be pumping even semi frequently, you really should get an electric pump.
B000HGQF9C|5|This gate is perfect! My foster kittens could not climb it as they could the traditional gate.  it is too slippery.  It locks great into a doorway
B002SW3CLC|2|I bought this couple of month ago my daughter loves it it is soft and absorb water well.<br />This set came to me with lighter body and it is like made by polyester it does not absorb water at all.<br />It's like these washcloths are water resistant.<br />I won't buy them again
B009R79D46|5|When my toddler outgrew her britax convertible car seat we went looking for a five-point booster.  Unfortunately, since my husband and I have smaller back seats in our cars there are very few options on the market that will permit the necessary clearance from the front seats to be able to install them in accordance with manufacturers specifications.  This restraint system fits snugly against the back seat, creating sufficent clearance from the front seats.  It is also light, and takes only seconds to install, eliminating the need for us to buy a second car seat for my husband's car.  We just leave the seat with my daughter at daycare, and put it in the other car to come home!  The vest is installed by placing it on your child and then threading a seat belt through the clips on the vest and clipping the optional tether strap to the attachment points on the vest.  If using the shoulder-lap belt only, it is possible for the child to wiggle out of position, so you may want to use the tether option if you have a wiggly child.  The seat belt releases are accessible to the child, so you may need to do some teaching with them on not releasing their seatbelts until the car is turned off.  This has worked out very well for us!
B00AJSJFYA|5|Works perfect for a wide doorway. Decent price.
B000LEG2WA|1|For the first three months of use, I agreed with all of the other reviews. But I am now returning this bag. It has ripped in two places and I have resorted to using an oversized purse in the meanwhile. Needless to say, I'm pretty ticked off. Parents have better things to do with their time than hunt down replacements for junk that doesn't work the way it should.
B00BQYVQWU|4|works as expected, the remote tilt function of the camera is great. battery life of the monitor is disappointing, but most of the time we keep it plugged in anyway. doesn't work over wifi which for us is not a disadvantage, makes it simpler (plus no worries of someone hacking in).
B0091E31KM|5|a very simple sound machine. but for this price, it's great. it's all we need. It has timers (15min, 30min, or 60min) but we just turn it on and leave it on all night. My daughters love it.
B007700RN6|2|I brought this after reading some good reviews, but it disappointed me. This saucer is not made for baby 's safety. When I put my baby out, my baby legs got some scratchs on.  Also, the toys do not clip into tray. It did not fit. I am not sure because it made in China.  But this is usa product . They do not even inspect this before selling? One more thing, the erxtra bar for small baby hurts baby front uppper body. It doesn't seem supporting baby when baby lean forward ...
B009CKB3I2|3|cute idea and nice and thick/protective, but they didn't stick well.  my son could peel them off.  on the other hand, they stuck well enough to leave sticky residue behind.
B001NAAU1A|3|This monitor is just okay. The thermometer and nightlight are great. However, the sound cuts out sometimes for a second or 3. It always comes back on, but it's just annoying. If I had it to do over again, I would buy a monitor with video and a thermometer. This problem isn't bad enough for me to get rid of the monitor.
B000CSEE3O|4|This chair is light and easy to carry around.  We traveled with it recently and the only issue we had with it wasn't product related.  One issue we had was that the hotel didn't have an appropriate chair to secure it to.  There are straps going both directions to put it on the chair, so there needs to be a gap to run the strap through the back of the chair.  We are currently using it at home at our table and allowing our toddler to choose between sitting in it or the high chair.
B002USE0Q0|5|There is no swaddle blanket that can compare. I was unsure when i saw the price but totally worth it! Im getting more and I am getting some for a friends baby shower coming up also.
B001EU4ZF6|1|**I am posting this review in several places since you can purchase the monitor and extra camera separately or as a set.  We purchased as a set**    We have had the Mobicam Ultra for a couple of years for our daughter and decided to get this new system when our son was born so that we could monitor both rooms using just the one monitor.  The monitor itself has two stations and each camera gets one station.  When you set the monitor to scan these it flips back and forth about every 10 seconds between the two cameras so that you can see/hear what is going on in each room.    PROS:  *Does allow you to monitor two rooms at once (not simultaneously but scans on it's own).  Not all multicamera systems out there do this, they can only monitor one room at a time.  *Decent sound and video quality.    CONS:  *The ability to choose between VOX mode and camera mode is on the camera itself which means going into baby's room to make the switch, rather defeating the purpose of the monitor.  The Ultra had this setting on the monitor so I could keep it on voice activation mode all the time and then switch over real quick if I just wanted to make sure she was still in bed etc.  This was a big deal for me because when I switched to camera mode in the Ultra I was even able to hear her breathing and feel reassured that she was OK.  With the AV, when you set it in camera mode there was (for us) static that I did not want to listen to all the time.  Same is the case with the Ultra but since the setting is on the monitor I would just switch back to VOX once I knew all was well and not have to listen to the static.  *The volume dial on the AV does not have numbers as the Ultra did.  With the Ultra I knew I wanted the volume at 3 or 4 but without the benefit of numbers on the AV it's a guessing game as to how loud it's going to be when she makes a noise.  *Lots of interference/static.  There was static each time the scan switched the channel and sometimes just random static while on one channel.  *The kicker, and ultimately why we had to return the item... we could see and hear another baby.  I live in a free standing house and the nearest baby to me is across a wide street and down a house so I assumed that was the baby I was seeing however I have now spoken with everyone on my block that has a baby in a crib and none of them have a video monitor so I have no idea whose baby I was seeing.  My best guess is that it's someone from one block over, behind my across the street neighbors.  That's pretty far away and even Mobi was surprised when I told them I thought I was seeing the baby just across the street.  FYI, Mobi also indicated that the interference and static I experienced was probably due to this other monitor so perhaps others would not have as much interference as I did.    We decided to get a digital instead (which incidentally is also what Mobi suggested).  We didn't get the Mobi digital because my first issue above is still the case with that system.  So far I like the digital (even though it's more expensive) MUCH better than both the monitors I refer to above.
B004RFWC1O|5|I love these diapers. They fit my newborn and are still fitting her now at 7 weeks. She is 9lbs, 11ozs. I think we'll probably get another couple of weeks out of them. They have been very easy for me to begin cloth diapering as a first time mom. Because they're an all in one, you just throw them into the diaper pail. If you're breastfeeding, there's no rinsing required, just throw them into the washer. They take a little longer to dry (in order to get the thick absorbent core really dry). My daughter, my husband, and I have been very pleased. The snap down for the umbilical cord was very nice while we needed it too. I'm so happy I chose the Lil Joeys instead of using disposables for the first few weeks. My daughter's diaper area skin is super healthy. No redness or rash. Love our Lil Joeys!
B00BVYAH3Y|4|My 3 month old loved this at first, but as he got older and started grabbing everything it would frustrate him because he would have the pacifier in his mouth attached to the plushie, then his active and curious hands would grab onto the plushie and pull the pacifier out unintentionally. I think we should have gotten this sooner -- before he started grabbing everything. Then it would have just stayed there in his mouth. Still, he's 4 months now and uses it as a toy we take with us in the stroller... he likes to tug at the arms and put the paws and ears in his mouth. It's super soft and the perfect size for his little hands.
B005BWXJKK|5|So far so good. Easy to attach to railing. Does not turn or slip. And my daughter is better protected and cannot chew on railing. I like the soft material and was easy to wash. Thanks for great product!

B000G80T70|5|Cutest little piggy bank I've ever seen! It was bigger then I thought which was a nice surprise, and it was shipped unbroken and in perfect condition :)
B00A6AYTT2|5|Bought this as a christening gift and it's so soft and perfect.  The song plays clear and it was a great gift.  I'll be purchasing for my next christening as well.
B00020L78M|4|This is great. We have it for our 7 month old son who was crawling all over the place. He loves to hang out in here and play. He doesn't hurt himself and if you add a foam playmat under it, it's even safer.  <br /> <br />It's nice to have insetead of a playard because you can sit in there with the kid and hang out with him. It gives him alot of room to play and crawl. He can stand up and hold on to the sides. He even stood by himself! The other cool thing is that all the toys are in one spot! We have two baskets of toys in there for him to play with. <br /> <br />This is portable and light. It's kind of a pain to reshape;(which is why it got 4 stars) but once you have it together, it's pretty sturdy. It's also indoor-outdoor, which is great for people with backyards, decks or pools. <br /> <br />Folds up very compactly. You could easily store this in a closet when not in use. <br /> <br />Overall, it's a great product to have and well worth the money. I highly recommend it.
B006P05S0Q|5|This is very useful. The pad is a good length and high quality. You have a lot of pocket to store diapers, wipes, even a bag dispenser! Very easy to fold and don't take much place.
B007E5B8UU|5|I love these burp cloths. I bought these as a gift but have similar ones for my daughter and they are the best burp cloths I have found and my sister in law agrees
B00G9923NI|5|It took the abuse of a two and three year old.
B0018MJTV0|5|Keeps the little ones from running into the streets or crowds..  Comfy for both parent and child
B001IXYOD2|5|Excellent
B00EUTBM86|4|I love this stroller! It is lightweight and easy to open and close!!! Love the color. The only downfall is the size of the basket underneath. There is not much space. But other than that the stroller is perfect!
