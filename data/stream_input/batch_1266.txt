0061452068|5.0|A brilliant synthesis of what has powered humankindfor the better for ever forward . For hundreds of thousands of years, man's technology has stagnated. He basically used the same tools for a very long time until one day, somewhere, man started to trade and thus specialize and exchange products and ideas. This new development was not due to a genetic mutation, to a bigger brain, but to the beginning of trade. Or to use the authors metaphor, we started growing a ever bigger collective brain. Matt Ridley, in a powerful demonstration written in jargon free and fun English, goes on to show how much our progress owes to our propensity for trading. Trading has raised our standard of living, increased our spare time, reduced conflicts, developed art etc... The author shows how much through history and in different civilisations an increase in trade has been beneficial and how much we regressed when trade decreased. Ridley shows how wrong the doom-sayers of the past and present have been  and rationalizes that as long as trade (with some safeguards like in the financial sector) thrives we will live in an ever better world. Definitely a rational optimist's thesis that you won't regret reading (unless you are a compulsive pessimist). Many ideas in this book will shock the good people on the left, but those with an open mind will benefit from new vistas. He changed my mind on quite a few things and it is hard to admit you have been wrong but that will be compensated by the feeling that hopefullyI have now a more open mind on a lot of topics such as climate change. Matt Ridley is a very smart and interesting thinker. Have a look at his other books too. They are worth it.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I needed this product to play some of the old SNES games I downloaded on the Wii. It works exactly as it's supposed to, so I'm pleased with it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this app! I'm used to most drawing apps having some sort of lag when you move your finger on the screen, but this one either didn't have one or was so small it's barely noticeable! It has a nice selection of tools and colors and it even has stickers. The tools paint/draw like what they're supposed to be, and you can draw with one thing (ex. crayon) and use another tool (ex. marker) to draw on top without muddying to create beautiful pictures! Between this and the old drawing app I had, I know which one I'm keeping.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|I was skeptical to watch this, because I hated No Strings Attached--a movie with a similar plot line. OMG. Friends with Benefits is so much better and such a great movie. It has two great actors in lead roles, and not just that, but the diologue is so punchy, funny, and well-done, it leaves you craving more. Is the plot itself semi-predictable? Sure. But the scenery, acting, and words make up for it. It has a level of reality that few films on this topic have. Also, it is obscene without pushing the envelope (cursing, brief nudity), but the focus on the film is on two people figuring themselves (and family drama) out. If you are even slightly curious about this movie, trust the good reviews on here and watch it. You will NOT regret it. A+++++
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|A great ending to a delightful series my whole family enjoys emensley. The story gets all wrapped up very nicely and it's a shame to say good bye to these characters.
B005V1WVPA|5.0|I have been a Korn fan since 1994. Let me tell you something about Korn...First off every one of there c.ds are great. Yes he made a few bad songs. Who doesn't???? I mean Led Zeppelin came out with \\"All of my love\\" and Metallica had that abomination \\"Saint Anger\\", PapaRoach's music is more softer than cotton now right? Atleast Korn stays to there roots you hear it in Jon's voice, Fieldy slappin his bass, Monkey's riffs. If every CD sounded the same it would be boring. Korn I think is one of the most influential creative bands. They try different things without selling out such as Linkin Park or others. I saw reviews on all there albums and I have to shake my head \\"They don't sound like there older stuff\\" OKAY? AND? Even if the album has maybe 9 good songs. Its still good and your still listening to it am I wrong? This is a great CD. Good experiment. In my opinion I have seen bands turn around for the worst. Korn love em or hate em they are HERE TO STAY(haha)and they continue to rock us all and surprise us with every c.d they come out with. You still buy there concert tickets right?
B005BW14FC|3.0|This band has been putting out stellar stuff but have to stay this one is just ok. There is the same old same old and some new vibes songs going on here.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Finally, after some convincing by friends, I downloaded Angry Birds Free Edition for Android Devices. It looks GREAT on my Kindle Fire and I am having a blast with it. It is a bit addictive, so I must limit my play. If you have not played Angry Birds, I would recommend this before moving on to some of the paid versions. The video quality is great, so I am really not sure why you would want to pay $4.99 for the Kindle Fire HD Version. Have Fun zonking Green Pigs on the head!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is absolutely better than what I was asking for in my head.  I am so happy and wish that there was more to come but I don't think that's going to happen since she's banned at least 12 songs from release.  I thank Amy's family, parents (mitch & janice), her producers (Salaam remi & Mark Ronson) Best producers out there for giving all of us the opportunity to listen to these songs.  Reviews say that her voice sounds sketchy but what they don't understand is that Amy is a very raw and real singer and that these songs weren't meant to be heard in this condition.  Amy's voice is flawless on every song on the album.  It's a shame that critics are so used to autotune and aren't used to hearing real talent and a real voice when they hear one.  This is another grammy worthy album.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|As I enjoy the feel of a book in my hand, a Folio cover was the most obvious choice for my new Kindle Fire. This cover is well made, attractive, comfortable in my hands, and the Kindle Fire fits snuggly into the straps. It appears to be durable, as I toss it into my purse everyday. If you plan on watching Media or playing games, you may also want to purchase another cover which is free standing.
B005HV6Y84|4.0|I enjoy this album, it is very different from the others, disappointed there is no Muse on this soundtrack, but it is still a good one.

0312611692|3.0|Morris, in his book about the rise of the West since the industrial revolution seems to have several goals in mind: 1.) To combat racist biological theories of Western (i.e. white) superiority, 2.) To champion the cause of what might be called geological determinism and 3.) the speculate on a kind of end-point for our (i.e. both West and East) society.  Much of the book is spent on a vast, ambitious but highly successful history of humanity.  The book is best when it details the distant past (up through the industrial revolution where it loses steam).  In paticular, Morris' passages detailing development in the East are excellent.  For this reason alone, the book is worth reading.  As to Morris' ostensible goals, I was less positive.  The first goal, combatting racial theories of Western superiority seemed like low hanging fruit.  It's hardly controversial to bash the \\"white man's burden\\" or Nazi eugenics.  Thus it seemed at times like a kind of political \\"hook\\" rather than a sophisticated dismantling of eroneous biological theories of race (which, in fact, are not detailed to any degree).  For that reason, while I support the goal in principle, the execution seemed a bit straw-manish.  I was less convinced by Morris' implication that evolution to specific geographic locations produced no differences in our behavior.  Since evolution obviously produced small but noticeable differences in human physiology in response to geographic environment, it seems almost odd to suggest evolution couldn't produce minor differences in behavior as well.  The problem historically is where people have assumed these differences are global (i.e. black versus white) or that they could be used to determined racial superiority.  So while Morris does the necessary job of dismantling racial theories of Western superiority (again although I'm aware some people endorse them, I'm not sure how prevalent they really are), I didn't feel his treatment of evolution, geography and behavior was verysophisticated.  Similar with the second goal.  Morris does an excellent job describing his views of geographic determinism and I think makes a good argument for their place at the table.  But I was less convinced by the degree to which Morris treats it as a sine qua non.  I think geographic determinism is part of the picture but I was less convinced by his pat dismissal of the impact of \\"great\\" or \\"bungling\\" individuals on human development.  Similarly I was unconvinced by his full dismissal of biological inputs.  Nonetheless the book is an interesting and fun read until the point Morris begins to speculate on the future in which case the book descends into fantastical speculation about Singularities (wherein we all upload our consciousnesses into machines or some such thing) or Nightfall (basically civilization ends).  I think the book went off the rails in these last sections which was disappointing as I had hoped for something more nuanced.  So, in short, a good but imperfect read.

0307887960|5.0|My wife and I have been doing this diet for 6 months and I am down 60 pounds, my wife has lost plenty too. At age 39 I weigh about the same as I did in high school. This is literally the only diet which has ever worked for me.<br /><br />I find the diet easy. I am never hungry, and I get to eat satisfying foods. Yes there are some challenges (we have to choose restaurants carefully). However, I have no cravings. The first few days \\"detoxing\\" from high carbohydrate foods was a little tough, but after about 4 days it was a breeze.<br /><br />The bst part of this diet is that it includes a consolidation phase to get your body used to it's new weight. This is missing from every other dieat and is the reason most fail. The second you go off another diet you pack on the weight. This is because dieting slows your metabolism and makes your body more efficient at extracting calories from food. The Dukan diet is the only diet I know of to take that into consideration.
B0061JPYX2|2.0|I haven't heard the full songs but judging by the preview samples, this sounds like a cd put together of songs that weren't good enough for \\"Back to Black,\\" with the exception of Body and Soul. And the songs that did make it onto that album, here sound like she was doing a style test to see which version sounded better--and it ain't these two (Tears Dry, Wake Up Alone). Sadly, there will never be another fantastic album from Amy but we'll always have Back To Black.
1451627289|5.0|Personally I was not sure how King was going to follow up the massive, sweeping character study that is Under the Dome, yet he somehow found a way.<br /><br />Although I don't necessarily agree with King's view regarding Oswald being a \\"lone nut,\\" I recognize the need for this purely as a premise for the novel and think it works beautifully if you accept it on those terms (however far-fetched it may seem in retrospect).<br /><br />King has managed to bring the age back to life, and with it exposes the glorious past as not so glorious after all.  Without giving away too many spoilers, let's just say the novel races to a 24-style minute-by-minute conclusion that is immensely satisfying in an alternative-history sort of way.<br /><br />Keep 'em coming, Mr. King!
B004EPYZXK|3.0|This film is OK for what it is:  a quickly made, cheap thriller that is supposed to be scientifically realistic.  It is made as if reconstructed from raw film footage into a story that at its best is compelling and believable.  Visually, it is successful in giving a you-are-there feel to the story, as the astronauts discover why they were sent there and what it all might mean.<br /><br />Without playing the spoiler, the scientists are sent to the dark side of the moon in secret for the military, ostensively to set up a satellite observation system.  Not only do they discover that the USSR has been there first, but they find a number of mysterious observations of seemingly natural phenomena.  The astronauts on the ground begin to suspect that they are not being told the full story of why they are there, with tragic results.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that none of the actors are well knowns, they do a very good job.  Indeed, they really look like straight-arrow, all-American types who believe in their country with a naive sincerity.  The team has real chemistry, from comraderie to coping with a deteriorating situation and crisis.  It is convincing and interesting, perhaps even moving to some.<br /><br />I would recommend this to fans of hard scifi.  While the mystery - the limits of which are never fully explained - is a bit over the top, it is good enough.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|It's just a fabulous app.  Great for any quick finger drawing you need to do and great for kids too.  Any less than positive reviewers want some full blown tablet form of something like Adobe Photoshop for $1.99/free.  Bottom line is that for the price it gets no better than this.  Free today, but this app is worth more than even $1.99.
B005OK721G|3.0|This is a film whose ambitions are blatantly clear:  it wants to combine the violent realism and shadowy intrigue of the Bourne series with the romantic chic and assassin's pop psych of Nikita and a dash of the high tech sophistication of Nathan Hunt.  Unfortunately, in spite of jerky-camera fight scenes and elaborate scenarios with the sinuously stunningly beautiful Saldana in tight body suits, the film doesn't quite work.  Even worse for an action film, I had this nagging critical voice at the back of my mind that continually reminded me that someone was making this all up - I could not suspend my disbelief and just watch.<br /><br />The story is about a girl who decided to become an assassin after she witnesses the violent death of her parents.  Right away, it appears unbelievable.  At 9, in a school girls uniform, she escapes a gang of seasoned murderers in a chase through the slum streets of Bogota, vowing revenge and making her way to Chicago relatives.  Skip to the future, and she executes a number of technically perfect assassinations - with none of the \\"things that go wrong\\" improvisations that make great caper films so much fun - while finding out more and more about her father's murderer.  Of course, throw in a little corruption and intrigue, and you get the same old formula.  Then there is a climax, she can't go back to her handsome lover, and survives for sequels (assuming this make enough money).<br /><br />Saldana and the other actors are indisputably talented and often give gifted performances.  The action scenes are fun, if too clean and in the end somewhat incoherent.  In one scene, she gets jailed on purpose, escapes to kill some prisoner, and gets back in her cell, framing a guard by using his gun and getting released.  The FBI then correlates a random photo they find on a police databank (sent by her lover's friend, who wants to help him identify her) with the security camera images of her nose and hands, all in a few seconds.  It was laughably unbelievable.<br /><br />I would recommend this as background fun.  But it is a 3-star performance from a first-rate talent like Besson.ould recommend this as background fun.  But it is a 3-star performance from a first-rate talent like Besson.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I had doubts ordering the Verso Artist Series cover for my Kindle Fire because quite a few reviews said it didn't fit.  Well, I love it!  The elastic bands are not very stretchy so it was tight getting it in, but once in, it is very snug and secure.  It is has a very high quality look and feel.  I especially like the leather case with the cursive writing across the cover as it creates lots of little grooves for the fingers to rest in and keeps it quite comfortable in the hand.  The interior feels like soft suede and is nice to the touch. When I first put the kindle fire into it there was a slight rise in the top cover and it wouldn't shut flat without a little pressure on it.  For the first week I just turned it upside down when it was resting and now the cover lays flat all the time.  I imagine that if you wanted to remove the kindle fire frequently this might not be the best cover for you, as it might stretch out the elastic bands, but for me, it will stay in the case and I couldn't be happier.  It's a very classy and comfortable case.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This box set has come in for serious criticism regarding its limits.  Indeed, there can be no doubt that this set doesn't have extended cuts and director's cuts.  However, what it does have is completely satisfying, i.e. high definition versions of the theatrical releases of the films, wonderfully transferred; deleted scenes from each film; documentaries, interviews, commentaries, and the usual fluff that comes with these things; and some video game materials.  Frankly, I do not think they will release the newer versions (extended cuts and director's cuts) as a box sets until they have released all of them individually - they will do it in a way that maximizes sales, based on timing.  That means that these are the only versions we will have for some time as they will prolong the cycle as long as possible.<br /><br />This will sound repetitive, but these are absolutely great films and have been a part of my family experience for the last 11 years.  We watch them together periodically and always made the trek to the cinema to see new releases.  They spurred my children to read their first long books.  Plus, each film is consistently excellent in its own way, quite an accomplishment for a series of 8 films.<br /><br />While we love the films, I doubt that we will want more than these as we are not the kind of fans that Trekkies are.  Thus, for those like us, I warmly recommend this set.  Interestingly, I got the version in British blu-ray for about $50. Given the price of the blu-rays of the final 2 films, that made it worthwhile for us to pay a little more for the entire set - without dvd and other media versions that we would scarcely want anyway.
0439023521|5.0|This book was fantastic.  Suspenseful, fast paced, filled with love, loss, rage, violence, excess, poverty, redemption and more. It's also so reflective of our modern day society that it's a little scary. We've lost our common sense and morality in order to satiate our immediate desires. We've lost our faith. Suzanne Collins is brilliant to show us this in such an entertaining way.   I love this book and the series so much I mourned the loss of characters when it was over.  The Hunger Games was the most captivating book in the series but they all serve their purpose in the story. Thank you for the book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|wonderful game, especially for a free game!  My only complaint is there isn't a game I can buy so I don't have to deal with the ads.
B005N95JA4|4.0|There is nothing to get excited about here. All this material has been around for years. Why you all wet??
0307266303|5.0|I found this book to be quite inspirational.  While it held a great storyline, it was also jam-packed with what I thought was great scientific evidence (though, it may have been more sound if they were cited/referenced), and tips on improving your running.   Before reading this book, I ran about 3 miles a day, 4-5 times a week. After finishing this book a few days ago, I \\"ran\\" my first 10 miler. I put \\"ran\\" in quotations because I didn't run the whole way, but it was definitely an accomplishment for me.   Excellent read. I really recommend it.
B004FOA84A|2.0|\\"Lots of items to collect and puzzles to solve\\" really understates the extent of this game. The game itself has nice graphics.  Gameplay was rather simple. All in all, it seemed like a preview to something else.  It's ok if you have a little time to kill and don't want anything challenging.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|At last! The Holy Grail of rock and roll in a commercial version. Gorgeous sound quality, plus a peek inside the studio as the magic is made. Fitting that it is released in a still somewhat unfinished state, still gives it that \\"what-if\\" mystique! Even in this format, one of the greatest albums ever made, consider that it used technology from 45 years ago. As great as Pet Sounds is, this blows it away! A tortured soul at its peak of glory and vulnerability!
0321704452|5.0|The Authors approach in the book \\"The Naked Presenter\\" is an interesting one, I like the way he has connected Japanese culture with presentation skills. This concept kept me interested and curious in reading the book.  The author Reynolds has presented advance concepts in a format that is very simple, clear and easy to read. This book is filled with good ideas and clear guidance for the readers who can greatly benefit in becoming excellent presenters.  The author has presented extracts of various professionals' viewpoints throughout this book.  This format of using several intellectuals insight in being a good presenter has been a good reading experience and very informative.  I felt like I have read several books in the process of reading one book. The author's comparison of musician's performance with presentation is very unique and interesting.  Removing barriers between presenter and audience is a good point.      In summary, this book is extremely helpful to any level of presenter to enhance and polish their presentations skills.  I would greatly recommend this book. Communication is a key aspect in being an effective professional and the author Reynolds has addressed almost all the aspects of being a good presenter.
B004V8W54Q|4.0|Looks and sounds even better in blue ray. As peculiar as it has ever been...hope we don't end up there politically.
0060873027|2.0|This novel has no basis in real science as most Michael Crichton novels do.  The story moves way too fast at first then drags along a very predictable path.  At some point about halfway through you just want it to be done with already.  Both of them are better authors than this, but this is a very bad combo for some reason.

0553381695|3.0|Don't get me wrong these books are great. Probably some of the strongest prose and brutal storylines to be found in epic fantasy can be found here.<br /><br />However, less is more. I'm not sure if its the number of factions, characters, mythologies or brutal acts, but it almost feels like nothing happens in this novel. I meant I know it does. But unlike even some of the worst novels around I leave this book with an overwhelming feeling of:<br /><br />nothing.<br /><br />I suspect my main concern is I'm hanging out for the 'big' plot. Many fantasy trilogies follow the plan: \\"There's something apocalyptic coming but men are too busy fighting amongst themselves\\" Martin appears to be following this but is greatly focussed on the fighting amongst themselves part.<br /><br />And while this is done well with considerable depth, I'm still waiting for the world-ending level stuff - maybe in to the next one!

B005HJWWW8|5.0|Ok, so I'm not an audiophile but I dig quality sounding music.  My current setup for sound is my Sennheiser HD380pro, Sennheiser HD555 and my Ultimate Ears 550vi (IEM) and this beautiful peace of work, the FiiO E6.  This magical little device amplifies our music to awesome proportions and it enables one to enjoy their music collection even more.  Seriously, for anyone who is on the fence on whether to purchase this thing, just do it.  Also, purchase this with the FiiO L9 (LOD) if you're an iPhone user because it further improves the quality of the music by removing the slight hissing you can hear on the regular 3.5mm connection.  ENJOY

B004LWZW8I|3.0|One encouraging thing I draw from having watched THE IMMORTALS: Henry Cavill looks like he's got the presence and physical goods to play Kal-El. As Theseus, he cuts a fine and dashing figure, even if the script doesn't exactly call for him to exert his acting chops. \\"Look noble and heroic,\\" the screenplay directs him, and dude does. And when Theseus loses a dear one, \\"Look desolate, but keep those abs flexed tight.\\" And dude does. THE IMMORTALS treats us to remarkable visual artistry, insults us with phenomenally dull storytelling. And if you're into Greek mythology, fuggetaboutit. Director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar may have been aware of Greek mythology, but he's only ever read the cliff notes. In a saga featuring a hero named Theseus, he gets props for sneaking the minotaur in. And he does sort of get this next bit right: Untold milennia ago, in heaven, the immortal gods waged a mighty war amongst each other. The losers - who came to be known as the Titans - were cast down into Tartarus.<br /><br />Ah, jiminy, but the film looks friggin' gorgeous and is stunningly lit, like a lush Renaissance painting come to life. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar's visuals dazzle us from jump, starting with an ominous overhead view of the Titans caged in a box deep in the bowels of Tartarus, their teeth clamped onto metal rods. They've been held captive for eons. That's a long time for teeth clamping. But this foreboding sequence sets the proper epic mood.<br /><br />In 1228 B.C. the vile king Hyperion (a menacing Mickey Rourke) aches to leave a lasting mark on the world and on history for ages to come. Reviling the gods, Hyperion seeks to free the Titans. But to accomplish this, he requires the long-vanished Epirus bow, a weapon which bestows uncanny marksmanship upon its wielder and which manifests arrows made of devastating energy. Hyperion stalks the breadth of Greece - which, in ancient times, was apparently composed of towering cliffsides - and razes each holy temple. He seeks the virgin Oracle (Freida Pinto) whose prophetic visions may lead him to the bow. All of Greece cowers at his approach, and one can't blame them folks. King Hyperion is sadistic. He isn't stingy with the eye-gouging and with directing his burly minions to hammer his victims in the sensitive area of the huevos rancheros.<br /><br />Up on high, on Mount Olympus, the gods gaze down on Earth and marvel at the doings of man - and never mind that the closest we get to getting a tour of Mount Olympus is that ledge the Greek pantheon is always hanging out on, the gods' poses so artfully staged it reminds me of those television perfume ads: the Greek pantheon... by Calvin Klein. Whenever the camera cuts to the heavens, here the gods are, on that ledge. Maybe they're renovating Mount Olympus? They're putting in a skylight. The gods, golden-hued and perfect, are debating whether they should interfere with Hyperion's plot. But Zeus (Luke Evans) calls upon an age-old pact, one which decrees that the gods may not interfere with man's destiny unless the Titans themselves stick their noses in. But unbeknownst to the other gods, Zeus himself, in the guise of an old codger, had been walking in man's world. He's been tutoring a fearless young peasant in the ways of the warrior. He's got big plans for Theseus.<br /><br />The action is phenomenal, and about as well done as the slo-mo process can have it. Theseus is a man among men, but even he's no match for the gods. I admit to getting hyped up once the Greek gods joined the battle. I don't care what other action films debut this year. Nothing can beat the sight of Zeus unleashed, wrecking sh-- with his hammer and chain. The violence is amped up. Skulls are stoved in, torsos eviscerated, limbs ripped off, and all this done effortlessly by the gods.<br /><br />I say, see this film simply to treat your eyeballs. The story itself carries a sense of detachment, and don't be surprised to find yourself unengaged in the quieter moments. There are passages that drag and drag, impenetrable plot points, and characters that surface and then vanish. I may have even glimpsed the evil preacher from HAVEN, but don't quote me on that. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar, in his eagerness to get to the visual money shots, settles for a shaky cobbling together of narrative structure and character development. What we see onscreen is awesomely awesome, a mastery of visual composition. But it might as well serve as an extended music video for some heavy metal band.

0385484518|5.0|This was a truly good read, a refreshing surprise. I had the intention of renting The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom in my Kindle, but my local library didn't have it and I picked Tuesdays with Morrie by process of elimination. Just a few pages into it and I was already drawn. It's a reminder of how we should really treat others, and brings to front and center the issue few like to talk about: death. Morrie's messages can resonate with everyone, he had a loving soul and he loved life and people. I wish I knew of him when he was living, but like he said, he will be remembered through his acts of love and by the memories other leave about him. This book makes me appreciate all the small things, like just being able to use my fingers to type this review, and makes me take extra time to really absorb the nature around me when I'm walking around. Tuesdays with Morrie reminds us to make the most out of what we already have.

0743437497|5.0|\\"The Shining\\" is King's brilliant portrait of an alcoholic's slow slide into madness.  In a way, it's no coincidence that King chose the word \\"shining\\" - think of moonshine.  Jack Torrance is a man haunted by his past mistakes.  Forced to take a job in a Colorado hotel over the winter, isolated from the rest of the world, Jack gradually loses his mind and succumbs to the seduction of the grand hotel full of decadent ghosts that haunt the place.  Alcoholism has distorted his perception to the point where he blames his wife and son for his troubles.  But really the novel is a glimpse into alcohol's grip on a man who is terrified of letting down the people he loves the most.  And in the grip of pain and addiction, he turns his self-loathing outward and that's when evil takes over.  \\"The Shining\\" is a haunting, moving morality tale, where Danny's gift - the \\"shining\\" - is really his innocence, an innocence that can see right through adult deception and hypocrisy and ultimately defeat it.
0307454541|5.0|This is such a fantastic book.  Well written, suspenseful, great character development, it has it all.  I have no idea why it took me so long to read this book.  My wife read it last year and I have wanted to read it for so long, and finally did.  It is well worth it.  I am already figuring out when I can start reading the next two books, but for now, you can't go wrong with this book.<br /><br />It is a little on the violent side, but not over the top.  Larsson did a great job of weaving in so many plot lines it reads like an Agatha Christie novel but with so much more intensity.  I would highly recommend.
B004N66XYE|1.0|Perhaps the original series is a tough act to follow as this was a total waste of time. Perhaps the fact that it aired on PBS right on the heels of the awesome \\"Downton Abbey\\" made this production an even bigger letdown. Hard to say but I had higher expectations for this and you too will be disappointed. Not much of a sequel really even though one or two of the characters in the original appear here. The two series are really not connected in my book. The story just seems all over the place and felt like it needed a few more episodes to bring the story lines all together. When I actually was done forcing myself to watch the final episode I just became more anxious for Season 2 of \\"Downton Abby.\\" Sadly, I think PBS blew it by not rerunning the original to refresh folks' memories beforehand. Showing a sequel to a show that aired 40 years earlier without any real refresher or info for those that never got to see the original series was a big mistake. Unless you recently rented the original, this \\"sequel\\" won't make much sense.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I'm a cantankerous old goat, rarely moved to hyperbole, but I was simply enthralled by this film: totally absorbed throughout, except when I found myself chuckling giddily at the realisation I was watching a profoundly brilliant piece of cinema. The last time I had that sensation was in 1991 when I saw Silence of the Lambs. Another Earth is an utterly different film, but in its own way it offers, just as completely, everything that this medium of film promises and so rarely delivers.<br /><br />In Another Earth, a new planet appears, close by, in the sky. In fact, it is another Earth, identical to our own. Thereafter, Earth II precipitates, frames and propels a delicate and desolate gravitational attraction between two irreparably damaged people. Irreparably damaged because the only thing which will heal them is the only thing that cannot: each other. Another Earth explores that relationship and, with the aid of the planet-sized metaphor, the ever-present path-dependency of our short, brutish existences.<br /><br />This is an independent film: budgets are tight and much is shot, Blair Witch style, on a hand-held camcorder. The blown-out exposures, over-sharpened lines and noisy, boxy sound give the picture the feel of a student project. But science fiction with production values at zero is like silent film: if forces you to watch, and undistracted by dazzling computer generated images and 7.1 digital surround sound, you are drawn fully into the ingenious screenplay and the human resonances it explores.<br /><br />Rhoda Williams is about to go to college. She's smart: she'll be an MIT astrophysics undergraduate, and she's handsome: not a million miles from a young Laura Dern. You might call her pretty, but she's by no means saccharine sweet. She is, however, tipsy: intoxicated not just with the promise of the path on which her young life is taking her, but with a little too much champagne. She gets in her car to go home. Rhoda takes her eyes off the road and gazes at this new Earth.<br /><br />There is, of course, a ghastly accident. It brings Rhoda together with John Burroughs, a composer and a devoted husband and father who is the only survivor when Rhoda's car ploughs into his at a pedestrian crossing. Thus are their characters brought together and simultaneously flung apart by the centripetal force of their own damaged psychologies to the most isolated, remotest reaches of human space.<br /><br />When John Burroughs emerges from his coma his reaction to his family's death is, well, to burrow: he retreats to the huge, draughty and decaying New Haven house, to drink, wither and die. He compounds his downward spiral with clutter: rubbish, bottles and piles  of trash: the detritus of his life are the physical manifestations of his disintegrating psyche.<br /><br />Rhoda emerges, after a similar period, from prison. Her spiral seems as destructive and hopeless as John's; she withdraws into herself and hatches various plans to escape the here-and-now altogether. Her more benign attempt is to enter an essay competition to win a seat on a probe to Earth II being organised by an Australian entrepreneur (yes, I found this odd too: perhaps this is a parallel universe where the men from down under won the space race). Rhoda also tries more damaging means of putting an end to her suffering, too.<br /><br />While morosely visiting the scene of the accident Rhoda observes John Burroughs doing the same. He knows little of the details of the accident and nothing of Rhoda. She resolves at least to apologise to him, gets as far as his front door and, human frailty being what it is, fluffs her lines. Instead, she makes an excuse by dint of which she winds up in a distant, but ongoing interaction with Burroughs anyway.<br /><br />Thence commences the tragic, and delicate, convergence of these lonely orbits. All the while that missing admission, like Earth II in the sky, looms ever larger.<br /><br />Their burgeoning relationship, we know, is asflawed by human weakness as was the accident, and yet here are two people, with no alternative means of recovery and who offer each other great redemption, but only so long as there is this awful lie between them.<br /><br />The film unfolds carefully, slowly and wondrously, without a false step throughout its length.<br /><br />When I emerged from the cinema a giant gibbous moon hung low over the Soho skyline like another world, as if even the universe itself was pitching in to Cahill's metaphorical scheme. It followed me home, slinking behind the trees and between buildings, always there, watching my every step. It's still there now.<br /><br />Beautiful, and profound.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonrnative means of recovery and who offer each other great redemption, but only so long as there is this awful lie between them.

0385535139|3.0|Very disappointing. Slow uninteresting plot.  Supposedly set in Chicago, the writer should have done just a little research on the area instead of merely tossing around names of neighborhoods and streets.  Characters traveled easily among very distant locations. In all, I expected more.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This film did not receive the publicity due to it following its release, as it is a true gem, albeit not marketed towards the main screen. Eisenheim (Edward Norton)is an illusionist drawn towards the art of magic from an early age. When he encounters a love from his childhood (Biel) and finds her married to the crown-prince of Austria, Eisenheim attempts to reconcile his true feelings for the dutchess with the political realitiies of Austria.<br /><br />What occurs, however, as their lives become interwoven again is a tale of heartbreak and melancholic longing, as Eisenheim is brought back to reality. The plot of the film, however, will keep one engaged to the very end, not only presenting the power of love as a motivating force but also exhibiting the true nature of human emotion and the human condition. Norton's performance as the illusionist is SPECTACULAR and well-worth a viewing. One thing is for sure....the makers of this film present one lesson as fact: EVERYTHING is an illusion.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This Album is extremely great to listen to. I love every song on it, she has such a wonderful voice, its filled with pure raw talent.

B005HS00NW|5.0|\\"I wanted to make an eclectic album,\\" described Anthony Gonzalez regarding his new album Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. The new album holds strongly to M83's tradition of a more open, clam perception of music- yet, revolutionizes their sound by introducing novel changes to their sound and collaboration with other artists. Nonetheless, the album contributes to M83's (which stands for Messier 83, a spiral galaxy) `explorative' styles throughout its double album, or as Gonzalez puts it was \\"like a soundtrack different ambiences...[as] I make an album about nostalgia, melancholy in the past and memories.\\" However, a combination of its flaws throughout the album and progress from the band's best albums makes the album an easy listen, and one that puts M83 on the music charts very well.    Hurry Up, I'm Dreaming draws much of its attraction from M83's EP release on September 27, 2011 (a month before the new album release). The single called \\"Midnight City\\" makes a statement to M83's tranquil feel to its music, yet introduces elements into its music including a rising synth-metal bass and unique song to its melody. Nonetheless, the song has had great success internationally, being featured on AltNation and being placed on the number one on iTune's `Electronic' list. The piece is a very inspiring piece that lends itself to current electronic music- by combining a unique computer generated sound with that other instruments including saxophones and guitars. The up tempo beat drives the song and its many transitions and vocal sounds- much like in M83's past albums including Saturdays = Youth (`In the Church\\"). The beat lends its influences to \\"Steve McQueen\\" in the second CD of the double album. Nonetheless, M83 sets the pace with its EP for discovery into the rest of the album.    From the `get-go,' M83 expands its possibilities by collaborating with Zola Jesus in the \\"Intro Song.\\" The song begins with Zola Jesus creating a more classical electronic ambience to the album- whichlends itself to M83's experimental nature- yet very fitting for setting the pace and tempo for the rest of the piece. A sense of tranquility and exploration is entrenched as the basis of introduction. Although Zola introduces the nuances, M83 does an amazing job with establishing this consistency for the rest of the album.     In addition, M83 attempts to expand upon Zola's classical feel by reverting to untraditional modes of music. Just like in past albums, M83 stresses a focus on the music with a retraction of vocal influence. However, M83 introduces a surprising sense of musique concrete by through its \\"Raconte-Moi Une Historie\\" by introducing a child's storytelling and fantasizing to drive the piece, combing it with a more classical techno piece. Nonetheless, although it is experimental, it still contributes to M83's expansion and open-view on approaching music. However, in contrast to the tranquil feel of the album, M83's ensures that he is taking us on a journey throughout the album through his piece \\"New Map,\\" where the upbeat and fast tempo contradict the rest of the album, yet introduce that M83 is experimenting, as well. Yet, M83 sticks to his power ballads in his \\"My Tears are Becoming a Sea,\\" using songs like this to maintain a steady flow throughout the album.   M83's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming album is without a doubt an excellent combination of experimentation in `acquiescence' and taking advantage of an artist's personal style. Personally, I believe that the seventy-two minute album is a positive direction for the band and Anthony Gonzalez- as the songs drive where Gonzalez may want to take his future albums in the coming future. Although Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is an excellent piece and an album I will continue to listen to- for preference of tranquil songs, its experimentation leads itself to not be as popular. However, Gonzalez attempts to maintain a fan base and garner new ones throughout his double album- which he does successfully. Regardless of its style and transitions, the albums purpose is intended to introduces Gonzalez's many interests and take up through a journey of dreaming and openness- finding a niche in every song of the album.

B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris Day was one of the most active and certainly most popular stars in show business from the late 1940's into the mid 1970's, the ageless and endearing girl next door whose wholesome image didn't get in the way of a multi-faceted career as a comedienne, dramatic actress, and near-peerless female vocalist. Since 1975, however, she has made limited public appearances (though by no means a recluse, enjoying her life and friends in Carmel, California) and in 1985 she came out of retirement to film a pet series DORIS DAY'S BEST FRIENDS for cable television. Each episode of this program features a new vocal performance by the great Doris, singing as beautifully as ever in her early sixties, but these tracks - and programs - disappeared after the show went off the air. 25 years later, twelve of Doris' best performances for the show have finally been released on CD and the result has been a smash hit in England, where the 88-year-old star now has a top ten album with MY HEART. The CD is happily now been released in the United States. There are an additional dozen or so songs that were recorded for the television series so hopefully we will be getting a \\"volume two\\" sometime in the future but for now let's enjoy these songs, extremely well-produced by Doris' late son Terry Melcher (a record producer for decades) and sung by the ever enchanting Doris Day with her \\"heart\\", as always, in her vocals.

B002ZG99QS|2.0|Tron legacy was a very hyped movie. my expectations were soooo high, and when i finally saw it, it ended being just a good B movie/action flick. i was turned off by so many things, like: the story wasnt exciting or engaging and the characters felt a bit dull (maybe because the not so good dialogue/script). after seeing the movie the first time i really disliked it, but when i saw it the second time i knew what to expect. i liked it the second time around, it was a movie with amazing visuals. dont mistake it for a masterpiece (not even close), its simply a visually fun  movie. surprisingly the characters grew on me.  buy it on bluray for stunning visuals. I have to admit though, the movie lacks thrill and interest half way into the movie. It's not a movie i would be willing to buy or watch frequently.

0525423656|5.0|Crossed was more action packed than Matched, although it started out a bit slow to me. I think this is mostly because it's been such seemingly long time since I've read Matched. I should've re-read or at least looked up some spoilers. But even with that, I remembered the characters and the main gist of the story.<br />  Once I was back into Cassia's head, and the flow of the story, I didn't want to put it down. I just had to know what would happen next, and what trials she'd face next. Another thing that I liked about Crossed is that we get more into the head of Ky. He is still a pretty big mystery to me, because even though we were in his thoughts, they still seemed veiled or guarded. I did learn a lot more about him though, and I think that it helped the pacing to have him in the story.<br />  Quite a few things surprised me in the story... how much I was able to care about some of the secondary characters that were new to the story for one. Xander also surprised me... I can't really say why, but he did something in the story and then something about his character from previous book that I didn't know and never would've guessed.<br />  This is a great second book, and I can't wait for the conclusion!

0307454541|3.0|After seeing that an American 'remake' of the film was due in December, and after seeing all the 'NY Times Bestseller'-type raves about the book(s), I bought the first two (3rd not yet in mass market). I am utterly befuddled by the raves. Somewhere around page 350, I found myself still awaiting something of significance to happen. At dinner one night with friends, discussing upcoming movies, this one got mentioned, and w/o prompting, my friend's sister exclaimed that she'd read the book and been hard-pressed to get through the hundreds of pages of... nothing happening. At its heart, and w/o spoilers, it's a murder mystery, wrapped in history and a crazy family. I've read similar stories that are half the length of this book - and far more engrossing as a result. Luckily, the writing style is easy to flow through smoothly and rapidly, or I'd have given up at that 350 page yawn. I intend reading the trilogy, but hope that they move faster. (My rating is actually 2.5 stars)

B006A819AG|5.0|The Roots continue to prove that they are the most consistent music group out there.  Even some of their older albums that were perhaps not as good as we might have liked, were still leaps and bounds better than seemingly 80% of the other music out there.<br /><br />In my time of doing reviews on my blog I've only given four albums a perfect five rating.  The Roots' album from last year, How I Got Over, their collaboration with John Legend \\"Wake Up\\", Hidden Beach Unwrapped Volume 1 and \\"The Carnivale\\" by Wyclef Jean, which remains today one of my top 10 albums that I've ever heard in my life.<br /><br />Today The Roots get the fifth 5 Rating (and third album to get that that they are involved with).  I've been a fan of the Roots for a long time, having come to them via D'Angelo who is my favorite artist.  I heard some collaborations that he had done with them in some live recordings that I have and was just hooked.<br /><br />Here you have a rap group that's an actual BAND.  They play their instruments, and they play them well.  It's not often you come across a hip hop band, but the Roots have been putting it down for hip hop in a serious way for years now and show no signs of creative drop off.<br /><br />Never more clear than on their newest album \\"UnDun\\" which in a first for the legendary Roots Crew, is a concept album.  Undun chronicles the life and death of Redford Stephens who embraces some bad choices in his life and ends up paying the ultimate price for it, and tells said story in reverse.<br /><br />The album begins with his dying and works it's way back to the beginning of the story -- the end of the album.  Clocking in at just a shade under 40 minutes it's a fairly short album, however it's an amazing piece of work that seems to alternate between being staggeringly beautiful and hauntingly depressing at various points throughout.<br /><br />One thing that I loved about How I Got Over was their utilizing feature appearances by artists that many perhaps would not have heard, who listen to the Roots regularly.  Artists like The Dirty Projectors, Monsters of Folk, Joanna Newsome and STS.<br /><br />This album also features some of these indie rock artists and once again I'm kind of blown away by the incredible sound that has been made with the Roots collaborating with these artists.<br /><br />In fact one of my favorite tracks on here is \\"Sleep\\" which features a singer named Aaron Livingston.  I have never heard him before, but he has a line in there that when I heard it I just sat back in awe, dumbstruck by the implications of it and the very idea of it.<br /><br />Something so seemingly simple, and yet complex and deep at the same time.  One of those things you'll end up thinking about later after you've put the album away to go to sleep yourself.<br /><br />I love the idea behind this concept album. The idea of chronicling a man who for lack of a bad choices might have ended up with a whole different (and perhaps much longer) life, and made it out of the environment that he found himself trapped in.<br /><br />I've thought back before to mistakes I've made, decisions I've made and how it influenced my life and how it impacted my ending up in the very room I sit right now writing this review.<br /><br />If I had done things differently, would I be here right now?  Would I have ended up in another state?  Perhaps gone to college, got a helluva job?  Met someone, settled down, had kids, and the stereotypical American Dream?<br /><br />Or was I always destined to end up where I'm at now?  I thought about that as I listened to Undun, because it made me wonder whether Redford was doomed from the beginning.  Whether his ending was predetermined from jump street and that he realized that and simply embraced what he felt was his destiny.<br /><br />It's definitely an interesting conversation piece, I think.  And that, ultimately, is what separates The Roots from your average hip hop artists out there.  The Roots stay coming correct with their intelligent and introspective works, while many others tend to focus on more materialistic gains.<br /><br />Unfortunately too many people would rather Watch The Throne, rather than get their heads into some real solid intelligent hip hop music.  And that's sad, but unfortunately a part of life.<br /><br />As the album ends, it has it's final piece, a cover of singer Sufjan Stevens' song Redford, split into four \\"movements\\", and tell the \\"beginning\\" of Stephen's life.<br /><br />The first part is Sufjan himself on the piano, followed by a string quartet interpreting the song.  After that you have Roots' drummer Questlove and pianist D.D. Jackson going to work, and then the final movement, which actually represents the beginning of Redford Stephen's life.<br /><br />As I'm listening right now to the final four tracks that form this sort of orchestral movement it's absolutely stunningly beautiful!  I mean I've read online where there were some who heard the album and didn't like the final four tracks and felt that it would have been better ending on the 10th track.<br /><br />I think those who feel this way are missing the whole idea of a concept album, and how every piece fits.  Every piece tells a part of the story.  Every piece serves a purpose.  And personally, I actually thought I'd be moved to tears by the 12th track \\"Possibility\\".  It was amazing in a way that words can't express.<br /><br />To sum up, this is yet again, another potentially classic album by a group that we've come to expect excellence from.  However just because we have grown to expect this type of brilliance, doesn't negate or diminish the quality of this album.<br /><br />Some of the usual suspects show up for appearances including Dice Raw, Phonte, P.O.R.N. and Truck North, as well as Big K.R.I.T. who has a great future ahead of him in hip hop.<br /><br />I also liked some of the vocalists on here including Bilal, Livingston and even Mercedes Martinez & Tracy Moore, of Jazzyfatnastees fame, who contributed the vocals to \\"I Remember\\" which is outstanding!<br /><br />All in all, if you like good hip hop music, if you like good MUSIC period, you need to do yourself a favor and pick this up!y people would rather Watch The Throne, rather than get their heads into some real solid intelligent hip hop music.

0307959856|3.0|What is most disappointing about this book is what it doesn't manage to accomplish. Not too surprisingly, like all the modern efforts to read sequels and other riffs on the characters in Austen novels (and Pride & Prejudice in particular), PD James fails to capture the unique tone and focus of the original, much less master the detailed character studies Austen provides her readers. More unexpected is the fact that although this pen is being wielded by PD James, author of the meticulously-crafted series of mysteries featuring Adam Dalgliesh, this doesn't succeed in being a a compelling mystery. Indeed the \\"whodunnit\\" -- who is responsible for the death of the man found in the woodlands surrounding Pemberley? -- feels almost perfunctory. PD James writes of her characters witnessing the eventual trial that is the climax of the book that they are all anxious and distraught. Unfortunately, she never managed to convey that to the reader, or create a corresponding sense of unease and tension in this particular reader.<br /><br />That's not to say that this is a bad book, if the reader is able to forget its illustrious parentage. It's entertaining and well-written; James has managed to avoid some of the silliest missteps of many Austen imitators, such as using the word \\"chuse\\" for \\"choose\\", or having her characters do things that are utterly out of the spirit of the times about which she is writing. And there are some interesting or intriguing glimpses back at P&P (although those familiar with the plot may find the first dozen or so pages, in which James revisits the events of that iconic novel, a bit tiring), and at Austen characters from other novels, such as Persuasion. Above all, it's a fun novel aimed at those more familiar with P&P in the BBC series featuring Colin Firth as Darcy, rather than those who re-read Austen herself obsessively. For sheer entertainment, I'd round this up to 4 stars from the 3.5 stars I'm giving it.<br /><br />The problem is that this is intended to be a mystery -- or rather, a single big mystery revolving around the culprit in the murder, that is supposed to be surrounded by several smaller and more domestic mysteries, such as which suitor Georgiana Darcy will prefer; why did Colonel Fitzwilliam embark on a late night ride on the night in question; what secrets are some of Pemberley's servitors concealing? But none of these is ever explored in enough depth in this novel to really grab my curiosity or hold my attention. We don't see into Georgiana's view of events -- although that would have been an interesting way indeed to explore the story. Indeed, the point of view skips from Darcy to Elizabeth, and back, and over to a background narrator, but without really revealing enough insight into any of the characters to make them spring to life on the page.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read this novel, and it's certainly a vast improvement on the many efforts to churn out Austen sequels in the publishing world today. (I'm waiting for the local book superstore to devote an entire row of shelves to this genre...) But while I was expecting an intelligent mystery, if not a book penned by a reincarnation of Austen, I got fluff. To some extent, it's a victim of my own high expectations -- but then, why not have high expectations when one of your favorite authors, who has been reliably delivering richly-detailed character portrayals in her well-written and complex mysteries, decides to revisit Pemberley and the Darcys? There will be insatiable Austenmaniacs who will adore this, I'm sure, but I think I may spend my own Christmas revisiting the original Pride & Prejudice and reminding myself how intriguing these characters were in reality. Maybe it's a mistake to mess with perfection?-- or rather, a single big mystery revolving around the culprit in the murder, that is supposed to be surrounded by several smaller and more domestic mysteries, such as which suitor Georgiana Darcy will prefer; why did Colonel Fitzwilliam embark on a late night ride on the night in question; what secrets are some of Pemberley's servitors concealing?

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I just purchased this case for my iPhone 4s. It was very easy to put on, including the protective screen cover. The case fits well around all of the buttons, jacks, and the camera. It seems pretty sturdy, though I haven't dropped it yet. My only complaint about the case is if you are holding it for a prolonged period of time, especially in landscape mode, the sides of the case are not the most comfortable to grip. I also purchased this case in smoke. This is not a particularly aesthetically pleasing case, but if you want something functional at a good price, this case is for you.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app is perfect pretty much in every way! I love the tools menu with pictures of the art tools. My kids aren't going to want to give my phone back. This is a fully-realized app. App devs take notice, use and learn.
0784011710|4.0|Streep did an excellent job in this movie.  All in all I thought it was just a fair movie but I know it got good reviews and many people lik,ed it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|It crashes regularly and doesn't seem to want to work. I'd recommend just downloading one of the many free e-book Bibles that are readily available, particarly since this one doesn't seem compatible with the Kindle Fire. Or better yet, read another book all together. Cormac McCarthey's The Road is much better than this drivel anyway.
B004BJMEO6|2.0|I was not happy with the content of the movie or the acting, even though other reviews were more supportive.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this a wonderful, I have it on my work PC, home PC, android phone and Kindle Fire. Everything is synchronixed almost instantly... love it!
B00005KAQP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, especially the singing and comedy aspects.  Whoopi Goldberg was better in this than she was in \\"Ghost.\\"
B002NWRMVS|4.0|A great album to listen to anytime of the day or night. I especially love the song \\"You Ruined Me Now\\".This cd was written by Norah after her and Bassist Lee Alexander broke up, and the end of Her Very Handsome Band.Many of the songs show this. She also plays much guitar in this CD. A little different, but I still love the cd. \\"Man of the hour\\" is a cute song written about her dog, something different.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good game. However it can be addictive. Convenient because you can also play on kindle when not connected to Internet.
B00018D44U|5.0|I like this cd as much as her first cd, maybe even a little more.This album is suppose to have more country feel to it, If it does its hard to recognize it except for \\"Creepin In\\", The rest of the album has all her beautiful piano playing  and singing. I highly recommend this cd for any of Norah Jones fans.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|thanks for fixing the login<br />feedly is the best Rss reader! so glad it works great now on kindle fire!
B00008HCCF|5.0|I've had this dvd a number of years now. I never tire of listening to it.I like her performance best in a small setting as the House of Blues, sounds better.I especially like a song she sang call \\"Comes Love\\", I never heard this song before. She received a long applause after she sang it.I suppose the audience loved it as much as I did. Her oncore \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" was the best version I've ever heard. She puts so much emotion in her songs.
1400079276|5.0|I know that I tend to give good reviews to Murakami, but they are not unfounded. This is the 4th of his books that I have read, and each one is better than the one previously. Following his standard form of real character in supernatural situation, Murakami has created another story that leaves you wondering long after the book has been closed.  Kafka on the Shore is now in my top-5 of all-time list.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|I love this cd, the last album in which she plays with her Very Handsome Band, and the break-up of norah and bassist Lee Alexander, her boyfriend of 7 years. Although I don't notice much difference in this cd and her other cds. I'm sure there will be many changes for Norah, and I hope not the last of her good music. This cd has her playing a little bit more guitar which she plays just fine. Other than that this sounds much like her other 2 cd's.
078689136X|4.0|I made the mistake of taking a break to move wile reading this book.  It was fun but I think I missed a lot because I did not read over a few days.  It is a convoluted plot with characters coming and going.  I had to go back to refresh my memory and everyone once in a while I would think I remember him or her.  Having said that I enjoyed it and that is all that counts.  Based on this I will miss Monday Night Football to watch Castle onTV.  That says it all.
B00005YW4H|5.0|When Norah won all those Grammy's, I missed it that year. That night on the news and the next day in the paper all I did was hear about Norah Jones. I went right out and purchased it. I got home, played it and fell in love with her voice and she's easy on the eyes too. I love all her songs on it and played them over and over. My favorite song is 'I've Got To See You Again'. I just love the melody and the words to the song. I've since became a hugh fan of hers.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|As an Opeth fan I was expecting much more. Like many have said, this album seems disjointed at times and you think a song is going somewhere interesting and the path gets cut short and you're left there lost, wanting more and disappointed. There are a few songs that are OK, Folklore is one of them, build up and culmination is spectacular, the intro and outro are good too, but not up to Opeth standards. And it's not about metal or death vocals, it's about missing something. I feel as though Opeth has lost its sadness in a way, the longing and melancholy. It's a good album and still love Opeth but definitely at the bottom of the list in terms of Opeth albums. I didn't want a second Blackwater Park or even Damnation, but something that goes somewhere.
1461190460|1.0|The Little Prince is an absolutely wonderful book but, this edition of it leaves something to be desired.  All of the illustrations look like someone washed them through MS Paint.  I can't believe that in the year 2011 someone would even dream of selling a product that looks this shoddy...every single graphic in the book is grainy.  This book is written with young adults in mind and is notorious throughout europe for it's brilliant illustrations....this edition is blasphemy.  BUYER BEWARE.
B005974CNA|4.0|Very good album, excellent production of course (Petrucci produced it). It's DT so you know it will be good, but there's nothing too new, I still love it though and recommend it.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|Maybe the ending made this movie worth suffering through but I just couldn't watch any longer to find out. I should have known it was a dud with Jennifer Aniston in it and I really liked her in Friends. A dissapointment.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Masterpiece, there's not one weak song in this album. The transitions and changes, particularly in Windowpane and Closure are just perfect to the songs. I've been listening to this album since 2003 and I don't tire of it, it's just a timeless work of art. A contrast to Deliverance, but yet a dark contrast, I don't know how they did it, the amount of material that Mikael had to create these two different albums (in sound at least) but both are dark and just plain excellent. Incredible.
B000022TSY|4.0|I got this video for a chinese gift exchange for my motorcycle riding group.  I thought it would be a great laugh (most of us were young adults when this movie came out) along with some hot chocolate and pop corn.  Who know's it may be the most popular gift to exchange!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Was never a fan of the game using real cards, but enjoy the clarity and seamless transitions while using this app. Fun and a pleasure to use, no complaints here.
1881273377|5.0|My wife and I have read this book a few times in the past. It's a great book and a must-read for marriages. The book discusses material that every couple should understand. I highly recommend the book. We decided to order an audio copy to listen to on a recent car ride. It was read by the author. He has a bit of a southern-style accent. We found it a bit distracting for the first few minutes, but grew accustomed to it quickly. So, beware, if that is an issue, you may not like this audio edition. Even that being considered, I give it 5 stars for its excellent content and presentation of its concepts.
B006C45MRE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Westerns and of Harrison Ford. It was an enjoyable ride which passed my expectations. A lot of fun!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought this for giving my knives a quick touch up while in the field.  I guess with that in mind, I would say mission accomplished.  This will not get your blades razor sharp, but it will keep them good until you can get them to a real stone (which I am huge fan of--recommend the Arkansas medium grit stone).  A huge plus is the \\"spike\\" for sharpening serated blades you find on many hunting knives (which you can't do on a stone). It works great!!! I would buy this for just this feature--really.  It is small and compact and easily fits in your pocket.  This is the products biggest detractor.  Because it is small (by design) you have to be very careful when drawing your blade through.  If you hold the sharpener in your hand, it is very easy to knick you fingers with the tip of your knife as you clear the honing channels. You should put it on a solid surface and hold the side.  A finger guard would help, but that would alliviate its' fantastic portablity.  As long as you are careful, this is a darn good buy.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I went through the steps, all was fine, until the app figured out that I'm not in the United States. Why didn't they just tell me that I can read Kindle books on my desktop computer with THAT app, but not on my phone? I wouldn't have bothered to go through the downloading process.<br /><br />Come on Amazon, it's bad enough that you discriminate against your many international customers, but why don't you tell us you won't let us participate before we waste our time and bandwidth?
B005URRCUY|2.0|I've been a fan of the Black Keys since their Fat Possum days, when they made unadulterated blues music...music that touched you and made you feel it. I drove myself to  my local record store and purchased this album today. With excitement I put it in my cd player (yes I still own one)and waited for that good old feeling that you can only get from a tune that is played with someones soul. That feeling never came. This album sounds a tad bit over produced......as though there were too many cooks in the kitchen when it was made.
B0054N73EY|3.0|I am fairly impressed with a few of these songs and uphold my belief that RHCP is one of the most fun, high-energy, entertaining bands of our time.  Most of these songs deliver the same spirit and energy of RHCP from the early 90s and I'm thrilled that they've still got it...for the most part.  As much as I want to, I can't justify a higher than 3-star rating, because it's impossible for most bands, including RHCP themselves, to compete with some of their earlier albums.  Not only that, most of these songs don't really get me super excited, and I often find myself skipping most of these tracks when they come up on my playlist.  I still think, that overall, this is a pretty good album worth having in your collection, and I'm glad to see that RHCP is still rockin out.
B003L8GPTI|4.0|Plays great, however the mixer should have lowered the high end, especially on the acoustic guitar. Still overall a great pressing of one of my favorite albums.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I've tried a few drawing apps and this one is the best one so far.  Must have for those who like to draw.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|Lost my original vinyl a long time ago, but still remember the songs that tracked well. There were many, especially toward the inner groove that were always a bit distorted even with the high end cartridge I was (and still am) using. This new vinyl sounds excellent and the inner tracks shine. Voodoo Child (slight return) is far superior to any version I've heard before.  Waiting a bit for the right time to play side 3...
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Its fast, beautiful, and has good functionality. I would love to see multitouch, and maybe some more realistic interactions (crayon has a hard time covering paint, etc.). But I love it as it is!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|just get it. you won't be dissapointed. use crayons, pencils, paint brush, etc. lets you save and share your pica and saves nicely into your gallery.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Simple and responsive. I would like some more thinner pens for more precise drawing, but as this is aimed at kids I think it is perfect for them already!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This app exceeded my expectations.  I was thinking whether to try it or not - glad that I tried this out!  Thanks Amazon.
0307586901|5.0|Oh, I fully admit it - I love crafting and making stuff. When I get my hands on a book like Martha Stewarts' Handmade Hoiday Crafts, I wait for just the right time to read it. I then flip through randomly stopping at ideas that catch my eye first time through. When I pick it up the second time (again at the right time) I read it from cover to cover.<br /><br />And there are some fantastic ideas in this latest Martha offering. The book is geared towards crafts for all the major holidays - Valentine's Day, Mother and Father's Days, Fourth of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, hanukkah, New year's, Easter and yes the one that is fast approaching - Christmas.<br /><br />And not every one is geared towards adults. There are lots of child friendly crafts that you can do with a small person in your life. There were some excellent ideas that I can see being used at the library - a doily as a stencil, thumb print hearts, heart and lollipop flowers and more. Ideas for colouring eggs? Oh boy, there were soooo many! I think I'll try decopaging some this coming year. Cards for every occassion with patterns for the pop ups featured. I'm not sure I could duplicate some of the elaborate pumpkin carving designs, but they're fun to look at. I have a bunch of buttons just begging to be used - the Mother's Day card is perfect.<br /><br />And lots of suggestions for Christmas and New Year's. There were some easy ideas for gift wrapping, cards and tags. And a really cute idea using wide ribbon as a gift bag for a gift certificate.<br /><br />I tried one of the gift tag ideas, using shipping tags, painting them and sticking on a piece of greenery. (The one on the left really needs a gold star on top)And I picked up some cookie cutters from the dollar store too. You could put some pretty Christmas paper behind to make ornaments. Or a photo, as I did - to remind a certain 20 something son of his time as one of Santa's elves! A great reference book to have on the shelf year round.
B003VANOFY|5.0|and it fits just fine.  I wear this for about 5 hours at a time and the top pad that sits on my head can start hurting, but I just move it forward or back an inch and I'm fine again.  I can't hear anyone who talks to me and they can't hear my gunfire while playing.<br /><br />The mic is great, best one I've ever head on an headset.  3-d sound is really good and gives games/movies more immersion.  Totally worth it.  Also, I never have to untangle cords.<br /><br />When I wear 1-size fits all hats, I usually put it on the last hole.<br /><br />Update: 2 years later!!!!!<br /><br />Everything works just as it did the first day.  The leather like coating on the ear pads peeled off, leaving a nice cloth texture.  I bent the dongle almost in half, but it still works!  As with most things logitech, they make very reliable products.

038572179X|4.0|When one makes a terrible mistake, is it worth spending an entire life to try to right this wrong. In Atonement by Ian McEwan, the author is effective in accomplishing his purpose of expressing his main theme of atonement by using writing techniques to give the reader better insight as to what characters are really feeling, and using different writing styles for each section of the story that helps the reader to better seize the mood of the story and the characters that are involved.   An important writing technique that McEwan uses is switching the narrator for almost every single chapter. It better helps readers to understand what characters are really feeling, and how they view each event as it occurs. When there's only one narrator in a story, the reader can only learn about other characters feelings by what the narrator perceives is their viewpoints, but switching to that character let's us know exactly what their thoughts are as they occur. A second way in which McEwan helps viewers to understand his characters is by using limited dialogue. When a story uses a surplus of dialogue, the reader is forced to infer meanings from what characters in a story say. Instead, Atonement uses the literary style of expressing each characters thought toward events that take place, which helps to hide lies, and express the rawness of who they really are. Both these literary techniques help to make McEwan's story more effective by helping the reader to better grasp the meaning to each scene that McEwan is trying to convey.     The sections of the story are split into different writing styles starting with the usage of the traditional style in part one. This part is organized into chapters, with clear perspectives, and particular chronology. This helps the audience to synthesize that the way of life for characters in part one has strong structure, is peaceful, and is ordinary. Parts two and three use a more modern approach; the organization loses structure and fluidity, as well as uses more modern writing techniques. This helps for McEwan to convey the chaos and lack of structure in each of the characters lives, as well as present the coming of age that everyone partakes in at the end of part one. The final section is in the contemporary style; the story is even more abstract, using unreliable narrators as well as conceptual writing. McEwan does this to supplement Briony's revealing to the reader that parts of the story are untrue, and a figment of Briony's imagination. McEwan's purpose for the differing styles of each part is that it helps the reader to better understand McEwan's overall purpose of the story, making the piece much more effective.   Atonement overall is a very effective piece of literature in that it clearly presents the authors main objectives to his writing, specifically the theme of trying to earn forgiveness. McEwan uses little dialogue, different narrators in each chapter, and distinctive styles of writing for each part of his story to help better convey his purpose as well as make his work stronger.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|A little too crass for my tastes. Whatever happened to witty comedies? If you are looking for a moderately (and I mean monderately) clean comedy, this is really not for you.
0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society surprised me with the delightful mixture of history, humor, heartbreak, and loving warmth.<br /><br />The characters were so endearing that if they were not fictional, I would want to travel to Guernsey just to meet them.<br />Courage and caring in tough times ties them all together.<br />Since the story is told via letters between / among the characters, one also is drawn into the book as if it is a bit of a mystery, as the puzzle pieces come together.<br /><br />I was sorry when I came to the end of the book, and liked it so much that I purchased six more copies for friends and family.

My setup has it close to my router, so I can't speak to how far its range effectively extends, but so far I have been able to stream audio from the internet and my phone with no interruption or problems.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|The people who say this doesn't rock like \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" or \\"Ritual De Lo Habitual\\", or even the records before and after that manic heyday are stuck, and simply not getting this tremendous work. This album is a quite-nearly perfect, slick-sounding rock record that just happens to be full of passion and restraint, both artistically delivered and considered. Adult? Of course! These guys are in their 40s. This album's strength is partly the lack of trying too hard, and mostly the sublime, consistently dark and wistful mood it conveys from start to finish. Stellar.
B005FNJL7K|4.0|I cannot but give Howard Shore at lease six stars for his music for the films as well as this compilation. I've lived with this music for years and delight in its beauty and creativity but have a few criticisms for this Symphony version. First of all it leaves out too much of other remarkable melodies found in the films. I know a timeline had to be set but I'm sorry about this. The second criticism is that the soprano, who has a beautiful voice, used vibrato (tremolo) when it is not wanted. Compare the movies' Rene Fleming's original version and you'll see what I mean. Thirdly the bass who sings the small part that Viggo Mortensen provides in The Return of the King is completely out of place. The soft smooth baritone Viggo used fit the scene so much better.  Nevertheless, the work on the whole is a masterful attestation to Shore's ability as a composer. Bravo!

B000UX6THK|5.0|There's just this certain magic to it........... just nothing else like it and there never will be.  I loved it because it's everything art should be: mysterious, eerie, beautiful, psychological, emotionally provocative, surreal, forlorn, sad, supernatural, oddball humor, with a horror aesthetic.... yes indeedily doodilie.  The first two plot lines are very captivating, yet the beauty  of Twin Peaks is more than just the characters and the storyline; it's the state of complete and total hypnotism throughout.  Hot babes too, damn.  Audrey Horne is sexyyy.  Still gives me the chills.  anyway i'm not sure if describing this show really does it a whole lot of justice, so BUY this and knock yourself out.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|Okay, I'll be honest: there's not much occasion for using this app. That said, it's a great app and plenty of fun. So if you don't need every app on your phone to be terribly useful, I think this is a nice pick for a fun photo editor.  All the filters are lovely, with my favorite being the comic book one (took several photos just because certain things look incredibly cool with it). There are several solid options, along with some general hue/saturation/contrast sliders for fast editing.   Overall: this app is exactly what it claims to be. :)

B000NVT0RU|4.0|This movie was recommended by a British guide who lead a tour through WWII Tunisia this past year.  I have visited a Moslem cemetery and have read about many Moslems participating with the Allies in WWII.  According to Wikipedia \\"in 2009 the BBC published documentary evidence that showed that black colonial soldiers-who together with North African troops made up around two-thirds of the Free French forces-were deliberately removed from the units that led the Allied advance to liberate Paris in 1944... black soldiers should be replaced by  white and North African ones from other units\\".  Apparently, there was discrimination and bigotry occurring at that time.  This is not to say that the Moslem troops were all saints.  According to some sources, specifically Rick Atkinson's \\"The Day of Battle\\", some Moslem troops did rape women in Italy and were very brutal to the enemy.  This was left out in the movie.  I don't know if this was because of political correctness or not, but it would have given a more realistic and balanced view of the actual battle conditions, which are not necessarily nice and pretty.  I also was uncomfortable about the scene in which Saïd returns to the war cemetery where his fellow comrades are buried.  It seemed like a copy of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  It may well be that the incident occurred but it seemed to me that there was some plagiarism going on.

B004EPZ03O|4.0|The Muppets was incredible! While the movie is light-hearted enough to appeal to children, it also spends a great deal of its time making fun of how ridiculously upstanding it is, all the while tossing in plenty of humor for adults. It's the first movie I've ever seen in theaters where I walked out of there sure that only a monster could dislike such unadulterated greatness (my apologies to all you non-monstrous Muppet-dislikers out there. I'm sure you have good reasons).<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is genius. An oil Baron cleverly named Tex Richman is planning on buying the rights to The Muppets Studio, pretending that he wants to build a museum when really the studio sits on vast quantities of oil. He knows this because he \\"Can smell it. Also, the geological surveyors said there was.\\" Our hero and new addition to the Muppets cast, Walter, is the only one who overhears the evil madman, and it's up to him to help get the Muppets back together for one last show so they can raise the ten million dollars necessary to buy back the studio and simultaneously prove that the Muppets still have what it takes in this ever-changing world.<br /><br />The crew has to be tracked down, Animal must reacquire his inner rage in order to drum, Kermit and Ms. Piggy must reconcile their rocky relationship, a celebrity host must be secured, and Walter has to find a talent, all in two weeks!<br /><br />One of the main reasons I got such a kick out of The Muppets is because it was relentlessly meta. I recently found out that this was a term unknown to my parental units, so for all you un-meta-educated out there, something is considered meta when it breaks the fourth wall. It describes that whole play-within-a-play routine where the characters are aware that they aren't real and constantly acknowledge that it's all just a show. In The Muppets, this manifests itself in a number of hilarious ways. For example, they'll have a huge song and dance number, standard for a kids' movie. But as soon as it ends, all the back-up dancers collapse in exhaustion, finally happy that the main characters are gone and their duties to the audience are over.<br /><br />Even more amusing is when the two old guys (probably the funniest Muppets), read out the key details of the oil baron's contract, stating that it's fool-proof except for one minor detail. If the Muppets can manage to raise the money in time, they have first right of purchase. One old guy then says, \\"It sounds like you just explained an important plot point,\\" and the other responds, \\"I sure hope so! Otherwise I just bored the audience half-to-death for no reason!\\"<br /><br />The movie falls into all the traps of an easy-to-follow children's film, but it's well-aware of it, and by pointing out its ridiculousness, The Muppets can have its cake and eat it too. The kids are happy with the simplistic plot, and the adults can crack up at the way that simple plot is parodied. In fact, the entire movie is one giant endeavor in meta-narrative. The film is about the Muppets being able to prove that they're still relevant, that they can still make people laugh. They want to show the world that in a time when television and film are shifting toward either the unintelligent, irreverent comedy of things like Dinner of Schmucks, or the dark gritty edge of new superhero reboots, the wholesome and clever entertainment of the Muppets still has a place. Children are not as stupid as we think, and the Muppets believe they deserve well-written film with a positive message. In this case, that is the message, and The Muppets proves its point with every top-notch joke and clever spoof.<br /><br />As you watch the film, you're sure to enjoy it, and that very fact proves the film right. Realizing that will make you enjoy the film more, thus proving it right further. They've managed to create an endless feedback loop!<br /><br />As always, Jason Segel is eminently lovable, and his man-child character is no different here.He plays Walter's brother, and his conflict is that he cares too much about his furrier sibling, sometimes accidentally ignoring girlfriend Amy Adams. Chris Cooper's Tex Richman is a fantastic villain, and his one song catches you totally off-guard, then proceeds to be hilarious. In fact, with the exception of one Ms. Piggy/Amy Adams duet that I found slightly off, the songs were fantastic.<br /><br />Like I said, you will enjoy this movie, and the more of that childish joy you still have within yourself, the more you'll like it. I would recommend this to everyone, and I'm doing so now (though if you're extremely put-off by kids' movies, you'll probably just find it to be one of the more excellent examples of such, rather than anything that will knock your socks off). The film deftly balances genres, managing to be a perfect kids' movie whilst simultaneously parodying dozens if not hundreds of movie conventions.<br /><br />Check out more on \\"The Nickel Screen\\"about his furrier sibling, sometimes accidentally ignoring girlfriend Amy Adams.

B005HP2JAM|2.0|[[ASIN:B005E7SEMU Buck]]  Of course, the variety of animals depicted is wonderful.  Some of the history of discovery is fascinating.    What this film lacks is the most important feature of looking, gazing, thinking about art:  doing this in SILENCE.  WHY could Herzog not have let the viewer at times have the opportunity do just that, and nothing more:  view, take in.  Why talk while showing the art?  Why not have the explications, with the art, and then - in silence - allow the listener/viewer to be merely viewer, and repeat - a second time - the showing of what was talked about:  this time, in silence.  Then there is the ill-conceived near-constant music.  Why have all that music (from a variety of sources:  a cappella voices, original instruments, scrabbling solo cello, piano, to name a few) going on most of the time?  Is the art so insufficient, so limited that it needs help of music - and there seems to be no cohesion in the score, except for some quasi-minimalist over-and-over-ishness?  I think NOT  There is sometimes a trifecta:  art plus talk plus music.  Talk, talk, talk, talk - with or without music - also while viewing gets in the way (of course, there is the mute button).  Why not be SILENT and let the works speak for themselves.  Too much panning does not help in the presentation.  I should say that there are some interesting interviews, but why have the voice-over (especially when the in-English speakers' voices have no congruency with the original speakers' voices) when the language of the explicator is not English?  What is wrong with old-fashioned subtitles?  Then one can hear the expression of the speaker through his/her speech.  So, this small, marvelous treasure trove (which no civilian, it seems, will ever see, so does it exist for most people?  effectively, no) is blown up in importance, thereby reducing it in affect with all the baggage that has been consigned to it in Herzog's ponderous, don't-whistle-in-church narration.  That is the \\"too much\\" of the title; the \\"not enough,\\" of course, means not enough time spent simply SHOWING the works.  Too bad.  The books available cost lots of $$, of course.  One might go to a library.

0143039482|3.0|John Steinbeck is one of the greatest novelists in American history and all of his work deserves reading. But The Winter of Our Discontent is far from his best work. Even his shorter works such as Mice and Men and The Pearl are better. The basic plot is trite and overdone in literature. A \\"good\\" man is tempted to compromise his morality for personal gain.  The story itself drags as the characters spend a lot of time talking and musing. There is relatively little action.  Even the ending is murky.  Read it if you must, but read other works by Steinbeck first.

B0000C5096|5.0|If I am ever in conversation with someone and it turns to Jimi Hendrix or live music, I can never hold back my unparalleled adoration for Jimi Hendrix and this album in particular. Having discovered it by chance, many of the versions on this record are absolutely brilliant. First off, the immersing yourself in this version of \\"Hey Joe\\" is one of the most remarkable experiences to be had. In the intro sequence, he builds up quick and you anticipate the song to proceed as the studio version does but rather, he pulls back, and offers a slow,  captivating intro that leads into the song. In one of the most notable instances of coincidental brilliance (presumably coincidental...), police chatter invades the music space with perfect timing, which fits perfectly with the song. The two guitar solos that follow are awe-inspiring to say the least, almost transcendent. The way he infuses life into the instrument is just phenomenal. I see my other favorite guitarists as technical masters of the instrument but Jimi Hendrix- he embodied it with a soul.     Other remarkable inclusions are \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\" which is also the definitive version (though it is closely contested with the version on side B of Album 8 of the West Coast Seattle Boy box set), \\"Stone Free,\\" and of course, his renditions of the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" and \\"Purple Haze\\" which are seamlessly bound together. I cant speak highly enough of this album. He makes the experience even more intimate by thinks he says to the crowd. My favorite quote is before \\"I Don't Live Today\\" where he says \\"...this is for all the cats who are struggling who are gonna make it anyway. That's one thing for sure, nothings gonna stop us- it's just a hard battle, that's all.\\"     To those curious about the quality of the recordings, which I am particularly critical of, is remarkable. On vinyl, I would suggest buying a new copy and moving one of your children to the basement so you have a safe place to keep it. I would have likedto have seen some other tracks, but the ones presented here are executed in sheered brilliance and are, at the very least, a testament to the man's sublime virtuosity. I apologize for the lengthy response, but in such a sea of material, this treasure certainly deserves to be discovered by all. Hope it was helpful!

B002VKE1K2|3.0|Another Blair Witch imitator, this time about demonic activity. You'd think this one would have a higher potential creep factor considering its setting is entirely the residence of its characters. There's no need to actually go anywhere to run into the horror, it just comes right into the home.  This film reuses many of the same set pieces of Blair Witch, but lacks that film's rich back story, so you get no sense of history. It does have a ham-fisted back story for one of its main characters that ties the activity to her, but it feels forced.   The concept is interesting and seems like it could have worked but there are several problems here. For one, the acting is weak, especially from the supporting cast. It feels like these are people who are trying to make a scary movie. There's just not much authenticity coming through the performances.   The film is also repetitive and not very imaginative. We get a generic demon. There isn't much here that you could not see on any number of \\"true ghost story\\" television programs. It's basically the movie version of one of those.  The demon does not seem to have much of an agenda either. When dealing with demons or ghosts you are implying an afterlife of some sort and that in itself sort of takes the sting out of death. These types of movies need a more spiritual basis to work right, some higher spiritual battle. There's nothing like that here. Seems like the demon just wants to kill people, like a serial killer with superpowers.   If you just want a roller-coaster with a few jumps and maybe some slight chills, this might work out as a one time viewing, if you are particularly susceptible to this kind of material. Just don't think about it too much.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys constituents Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney's previous offering--\\"Brothers\\"--was their first conventional success, despite the fact that it had some noticeable weaknesses.  Namely, it featured a large number of ballads and underwhelming up-tempo tracks, which were a huge contrast to the contents of the album's most endeared, hard-hitting predecessors, \\"Thickfreakness\\" and \\"Rubber Factory.\\"  Now, the Black Keys are back to fill a gaping void in the Alternative Rock scene.  They have approached the project with much needed innovation and a revamped sound, in order to create something more than a sequel to their prior commercial success.  This venture is marked by a fearless attempt to capture listeners by muscling full speed through perilous terrain, and it reaches its mark without once losing momentum--or a sense of humor.<br /><br />Auerbach and Carney were taking a risk by returning to the formula of the excessively produced \\"Attack & Release\\" and their biggest commercial single yet, \\"Tighten Up,\\" from \\"Brothers,\\" by once again teaming up with Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton--this time, allowing him full participation in the creative process.  His fingerprints are prominent all over this release, but that--in and of itself--is not necessarily a bad thing.  Have no fear--The Black Keys have not been recreated in the Gnarls Barkley image, and this is not, yet another spaghetti western for which Burton has such a glaring affinity.  In fact, there is very little semblance to any of Burton's other projects.  Instead, the end result is simply a more polished and accessible sound that still holds true to the band's character, with only the slightest hint of artistic surrender.  The Black Keys began a gradual progression toward this style with their last few albums, so it seems like a natural development.  What prevents the mishaps of years past is the band's increased awareness of what works and what will inevitably fall flat.<br /><br />Despite notable changes, the Black Keys of yesteryear are certainly recognizable in this compilation.  There is the all-familiar hand clapping, foot stomping, and pounding bass set to a scenery of rough, fuzzy guitar licks.  With \\"Little Black Submarines\\" they begin with a ballad-style intro that lacks the distracting falsetto that was oh-so-prominent in \\"Brothers,\\" and halfway through, they turn it full throttle.  The transition from haunting splendor to gripping intensity makes a gut-twisting impact that will leave fans salivating for the first opportunity to witness a live performance of this singular track. In \\"Gold on the Ceiling,\\" the guys add some luster and opulence that breaks through the nebulous front.  As a whole, the tracks are caffeinated diatribes about deceitful women, stolen money, and the like.  Although there is some carryover of lyrical vulnerabilities and the overdone themes of their past works, the music's stylistically rich and witty peculiarities are all-encompassing, which protects the material from being unduly compromised.<br /><br />While fans of the band's earlier works might be irritated by the continued trend away from their frenzied, raw energy roots, El Camino is not a far cry from their origins.  Carney returns from the watered down percussion that characterized the \\"Brothers\\" interval to his trademark assaults of his drum kit, and Auerbach reinstitutes his more coarse and rousing vocal approach.  While it is a more mature and smooth sound, it is punched full of the requisite edginess, distortion, and oddball antics.  Amidst the dark and broody mood are some heavy rhythms and thumping beats--thanks to the repeat collaboration with Danger Mouse--that culminates into a much more compelling and momentous successor to the vaguely bland, yet highly recognized, \\"Brothers.\\"  There is a sense of cinematic peril and waywardness that is incongruously alluring, and the temptation to ride shotgun through this adventure is palpable.s of yesteryear are certainly recognizable in this compilation.

0385535139|4.0|There may be no literary cachet to this admission, but I've always enjoyed John Grisham novels.  They're fun, they're entertaining, and Grisham rarely lets me down.  A lot of his novels come packaged with a message, but his latest, The Litigators is really just a romp.  It opens with successful bond lawyer David Zinc \\"snapping\\" on the way to his 80-hour-a-week job.  Instead of the office, he spends the day in a bar getting absolutely blotto and reevaluating his life.  Clearly changes have to be made.  Still enormously inebriated, David staggers into the offices of Finley & Figg.  If you were being charitable, you might call them \\"ambulance chasers.\\"  Senior partner Oscar Finley and junior partner Wally Figg are a couple of hustlers scraping by in their street practice.  They aren't too picky about their cases, and don't loose any sleep over legal ethics.  What other law firm would actually hire a drunken lunatic with no relevant experience?<br /><br />Finley and Figg would because Wally insists that their ship is finally going to come in in the form of a huge mass torte case against a drug manufacturer.  This case may indeed be their ticket to the big time, but all meal tickets come with unexpected complications.  I've made the premise of this novel sound light, and it is, but things do get heavier as the story goes along.  It's a good yarn, but the real strength of this novel is the characters.  It's hard not to root for David to find his way as he swims with the sharks in treacherous legal waters.  Wally is a larger than life and deeply flawed character, but it's hard not to root for him, too--for the entire firm of underdogs.  Even a bar patron with a walk-on role held me captivated.  The story moves quickly and the end is satisfying.<br /><br />I was looking for a light vacation read and The Litigators was exactly what the doctor ordered.  I shall look forward to seeing the film (that is surely in the works) some day.

0143038095|4.0|Amy Tan's novel The Joy Luck Club unveils the griefs of cultural transitions as well as the difficulties of coping with already cemented traditional practices. Telling the story through the eyes of four Chinese mothers and their daughters, Tan creates a book that relates closely to old Chinese ways but through its feministic depictions achieves a universal purpose.     The piece is divided into eight points of views in which the mother's story is told, followed by her daughter. Using this strategy, Tan manages to organize the storytelling efficiently, however, using fewer character examples would have still delivered her message to the readers, without being so redundant. Nevertheless, juxtaposing the lives of Chinese daughters with their mothers was a creative way to portray older Chinese beliefs and relationships versus those of modern Americans. Moreover, Tan utilizes language to serve as a strong barrier between the mothers and daughters. For example, the dialogue of the Chinese born characters consists of broken words and a harsher tone, which reveals their prominent Chinese heritage while also showing their struggles to live and adapt to a new environment. With the daughters, their perfect English reflects not only their modern upbringing, but the weight of their mothers' prides. In their minds, having a fluent tongue and obtaining an education would not only raise their social standing, but would allow their daughters to stand up on their own two feet and not settle for their happiness.    Although some may be critical of Tan's explicit details, her non- sugarcoating approach captures the audience's attention and helps them truly understand the harsh realities of Eastern philosophies. Reader's can also relate to the up and down relationship between the daughters and mothers and the pressures of living up to their standards. Despite the differences, each story intertwines with one another to say there is a light at the end of every tunnel.

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson has achieved a herculean feat in researching and writing this book in the limited time that he had. He managed to interview Steve Jobs 40x and is able to quote Jobs, sometimes multiple times, on every important person and event in his life.  This is a real coup. And of course there are the many, many other interviews he did. As the author of a bestselling tech biz book myself (although not on the level of this one), I know how much work it is to sift through interviews and pick out the useful comments and weave them into the narrative. Isaacson is likewise true to his word in making this book also a story about innovation and business. It is perhaps not as detailed as some technoids would like, but it is more than enough for a broad readership. And even there, many of the shallow and catty \\"reviews\\" and other articles I have read in publications seem to be by people who did not bother to read the book or did a good deal of skimming and missed the innovation & business aspects in favor of the gossip. The business acumen displayed by Jobs when he returned to Apple was particularly interesting. On that note, this book could justifiably be assigned as reading at any graduate business school as a basis of real-world discussion alternative to the usual dry case studies. This is one of three most valuable books I have read this year, along with \\"The Black Swan\\" (second edition) and \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow.\\" Isaacson convincingly makes the case that Jobs will be remembered for the creative businessman he was, like Ford and Edison, when so many others are long forgotten.

The cd booklet itself is lavish with a comprehensive essay and a track by track analysis. If you're a Blondie fan then this album's a must !
B0059XTUMC|4.0|To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinee idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in [[ASIN:B00003CXCW Sunset Boulevard]], \\"We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then.\\" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a \\"meet-cute\\" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another \\"meet-cute\\" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard [[ASIN:B003B3V0X4 A Star Is Born]] storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's [[ASIN:B0002DCHQA Sunrise]] and King Vidor's [[ASIN:7885726967 The Crowd]] and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' [[ASIN:B0050G3NWG Citizen Kane]] to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.<br /><br />Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.<br /><br />The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as [[ASIN:B00006DEF9 Singin' in the Rain]]. By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from [[ASIN:B0009GX1C4 The Thin Man]] series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's [[ASIN:B000ICXQG0 Vertigo]] score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of just 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.The Thin Man]] series.

1451627289|4.0|According to his Afterword, King originally conceived of this novel in 1972 but decided not to work on it then because of the enormous amount of research involved in presenting the lead-up to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. At the time of the novel's conception, King was still a part-time writer employed full-time as a high-school English teacher, the success of Carrie that allowed him to write full-time still some time in the future.<br /><br />So it's perhaps fitting that the protagonist of 11/22/63 is one Jake Epping, Maine high-school English teacher in 2011 and soon to be a time traveller to the world of Ago (as he calls it) -- September 1958.<br /><br />Basically, the premise of 11/22/63 is that there's a mysterious gateway in time located in the supply closet of a greasy-spoon restaurant in 2011. The proprietor of the restaurant, a friend of Jake's, has been using the gateway for years to buy cheap supplies from 1958 stores. The gateway always goes back to the same exact time, the duration of one's 1958 visit is always two minutes in 2011 no matter how long you stay in 1958, and every time you travel back in time, everything you did on your previous visit is erased. The restaurant owner has been buying the 'same' hamburger from 1958 for years, for example.<br /><br />But now Al, the restaurant owner, is dying of cancer, having failed to live long enough starting in 1958 to make it to 1963 and save JFK, which he believes will fix almost everything that went wrong following JFK's assassination. So he convinces Jake to take up the torch. Both men want solid confirmation that Oswald acted alone (in both the novel and in King's mind, Oswald's status as a lone gunman is almost completely certain), so killing Oswald before there's some nearly complete proof of his approaching guilt isn't justifiable.<br /><br />Al dies, leaving Jake with a large stash of money he's picked up in repeated trips to 1963 and copious notes on where and when Jake needs to be to confirm or disprove Oswald's guilt. And off we go, with an early sidetrip to demon-haunted Derry, Maine (location, most notably, of King's 1986 novel It) before the main event.<br /><br />The laws of the time bubble mean that this isn't a science-fiction novel -- the past tries to protect itself from change, and some of the rules governing cause-and-effect would seem to require a conscious, self-correcting mechanism. That's OK, as King has never been all that good at science fiction. That he sticks us in Derry a couple of months after the main 1958 events of It also points to the fact that this novel takes place in a universe where the supernatural works.<br /><br />And there are other potential complications. A seemingly harmless drunk always hangs out at the 1958 exit point of the bubble. But the drunk, Al has observed, actually seems to be vaguely aware that time is being mucked with. Is someone or something monitoring Jake once he makes his way to the past? Some of his nightmares suggest this may be true.<br /><br />King's plotting is sharp here, free of most of the longeurs that plagued Under the Dome and a few other recent novels. The Derry sequence seems like the best section of the novel to me, partially because we revisit It from a slightly different perspective, and partially because Jake's double-outsider view of Derry as both a non-resident and a time traveller adds another layer to It. Derry really does resemble one of H.P. Lovecraft's supernaturally skewed towns herein. The town scares Jake for the months he spends there, despite the fact that the child-killing creature from It is (mostly) somnolent by the time of Jake's stay in Derry.<br /><br />Once his business is done in Derry, Jake moves on, first to Florida and ultimately to Texas to begin gathering information on Lee Harvey Oswald. King leaves plenty of room for both exposition on the Kennedy assassination and for Jake's late idyll in a small Texas town where he worksas a teacher and eventually falls in love. But time (or maybe Time would be more accurate) continues to try to stop Jake. Worse, strange coincidences and nightmares start to plague him. Can history be altered in such a large way? And what will 2011 look like when Jake returns to it, if he does return?<br /><br />Well, that's the point of the whole later stretch of the novel, isn't it? King keeps the plot chugging along, and the final stages of the struggle to stop Oswald are as tense as any sustained sequence he's ever written. The novel also makes the historical characters explicable if not necessarily sympathetic -- even Oswald becomes a figure of pity as well as of wrath, as do his Russian wife and young daughter.more accurate) continues to try to stop Jake.

1400069181|4.0|\\"Start Something That Matters\\" is the best self-help book this generation could ask for.  So many speakers (motivational/religious/political) out there today tell us that our generation is the one that will really matter.  That begs the big question: HOW.  Blake Mycoskie doesn't tell you verbatim how to start something that matters to you...he tells about how he did it, and gives practical suggestions that I think many writers or motivators would leave out.  In addition to all the practicality, there are also wonderfully funny stories, and moments of great realness shared by the author.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I now understand exactly what happened to our country's economy. I recommend you also watch this movie to learn exactly how a large group of self-centered, greed-oriented individuals within Wall Street, the banking industry, and our so called \\"government regulators\\" destroyed a global economy to make themselves richer.   MUCH MUCH better than Michael Moore's \\"Capitalism, A Love Story\\" which, at the end, claims that our country is now heading in the right direction and everything is OK because of President Obama. The end of this movie provides a much more realistic look into how Obama made alot of promises to get into office, but is just continuing old ways, still controlled by the same wealthy businessmen. Another puppet.

B005URRCUY|3.0|My brother and I were raised on a healthy diet of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, etc. As such, we've always regarded the '67 - '77 era as the Holy Grail of Rock n' Roll. Except for a weird year-long foray into rap when we were teenagers, we've never strayed from the path of Rock. I became a fan of the Keys five years ago, when my brother stuck a joint in my mouth and \\"Magic Potion\\" in the disc player. I was hooked (and still regard that album as one of the best of 2000's).  With the release of \\"Brothers,\\" I was initially excited to see the Keys get the popularity they deserved. Brothers, to me, was not so much selling out, as trying a new direction. They have, after all, operated quite awhile in obscurity. They found their working formula for success, to say the least, getting Rolling Stone magazine's number two pick for best album of 2010. My attitude of the music business, especially nowadays, is this: once you've made it, you've made it. If you released an album America likes, they will keep buying your albums no matter how much they suck. But the Keys don't suck, so I figured, \\"Hey, now that they've made it, they can record anything they please and people will like it.\\" I figured El Camino would be the Keys' opportunity to dose their audience with something big. It seems I was wrong.  I bought this album today, eyeing the sticker that said \\"Play Loud\\" with excitement. What I found was Brothers Pt. II, except that it took the songs they made big bucks off of (\\"Howlin' For You\\" in particular) and replicated it nearly a dozen times. The beats, though entertaining, are rehashed from one song to the next. Dan Auerbach's (guitar, vocals) once dinosaur-sized guitar style has been demoted to rhythm section. Patrick Carney (drums), who once sounded like a disciple of John Bonham, is monotonous. Undoubtedly, this album will produce several long players on the dance floor (\\"Lonely Boy,\\" \\"Sister\\"), but this album seems to lack ambition. It seems the Keys were more interested in playing for their new sheeple audience than for the people who stuck it out with them through obscurity.   That's not to say I hate this album. I don't. It may be mainstream, but it's easily a hundred cuts above what everybody is listening to, like Ke$ha, Lil Wayne, and Lady Gaga. Maybe that's because the Keys have ten years of experience in MAKING music, rather than singing over music made for them. There is certainly a level of sophistication in \\"El Camino\\" that makes me believe that modern music is not totally dead. One thing people may not notice, for example, is that Dan is using a lot of syncopated Jazz rhythms in his playing, he's just turned the volume up and cranked up the distortion. In that regard, while \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\" sounds very reminiscent of Green Day circa 1994, there is no band that the Keys can be compared to. They retain their own sound and their artistic integrity. It's just that the songs on \\"El Camino\\" fail to push the limits. When I was listening to \\"Dead and Gone\\" for example, there was a short, fifteen second segment in which Dan added some gritty, delicious guitar embellishments. I waited until the end of the song, praying that he would finish it out with another, lengthier solo. It ended abruptly, just as all the songs on this album do. Only one of the songs reaches four minutes in length, so just when it looks like the band is catching on to something, they give it up. In addition, there is not one solo designed to give you chills.   In short, if you came to the Keys through \\"Brothers,\\" this album is probably right up your alley. It's visceral and upbeat, but tinged with the same bluesy undertones that made \\"Brothers\\" a novelty. If you're a longtime fan like myself, I'd advise you to listen to it through youtube or an online player before you buy it. I know there will be at least a few songs which I will play to death (\\"Run Right Back\\" \\"Mind Eraser\\"), but above all this album showed me that the days of \\"MagicPotion\\" and \\"Attack & Release\\" are dead, dead, dead. It's unfair to expect a band to be doing the same thing they were doing five years before, and I don't, but you certainly can't call them a blues rock band any longer. I'm not sure you can even call them a rock band.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />This new album by The Black Keys has been riding a tidal wave of anticipation and it will not die disappointingly out in the middle of the ocean, rather it is poised to crash on the shores of music fandom around the world.  It's poised to crash hard (like tidal waves tend to do) and knock stuff over and wash people away and shiz like that.  Much will be written about this one so I'm gonna try and keep this simple:<br /><br />This album totally effing rocks.<br /><br />And isn't that really all you need to know?<br /><br />The first three tracks alone are some of the greatest 1-2-3 album-opening-punches that I've ever heard.<br /><br />Were I present at a live performance of this album I feel that I, normally a painfully self-aware person, might actually be able to turn off my inhibitions and lose myself in the music.<br /><br />I leave you with the following food for thought:<br /><br />THE ROCK SNOB'S DECREE (a little witty poem by Constant Listener)<br />If you don't wanna rock then don't buy this<br />But if you do wanna rock then do<br />If you say this don't rock you're not lyin'<br />It's just what you're saying's not true...<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener

B006H53KV8|4.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />If you don't know who Doris Day is there are a lot of things you could do to correct such a travesty of baby-boomer pop culture ignorance, but my favorite suggestion (assuming you like movies) would be to watch the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock film THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, in which she presents a classic Doris Day acting performance accompanied by the introduction of her signature song - \\"Que Sera Sera\\" to the world.<br /><br />And now here is Ms. Day at the age of eighty-seven, suddenly releasing an album of songs a full seventeen years after her last such effort.<br /><br />And it's good too.<br /><br />One of the most popular singers and actresses of the 20th century has still got it going on.  Granted, the majority of the songs on this album were recorded nearly thirty years ago (and the rest are even older), but if the artist is to the world what the artist gives to the world, then this year Doris Day is magically thirty years younger and once again doing what she does best.<br /><br />And speaking of knowing who Doris Day is - how old are you anyway?  Perhaps leave a comment and let your fellow music appreciators know and we'll all get a sense of the kind of generational wingspan Ms. Day may (or may not) possess in the Information Age.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener

0316077046|2.0|Ok...so 2.9 stars. Can't quite give this 3 Stars because I can't say that I \\"liked\\" it--which is what my 3 Star rating is listed as.<br /><br />Here's the deal. I read Beautiful Creatures (the first book in this series) last year during the holiday season on a trip to my in-law's house. I read the entire book in one day. It wasn't so much that the reason I finished it in one day was because I couldn't put it down so much as I really just had the opportunity to keep reading, so I did. I think because I read it all in one sitting, it didn't feel like it took as long. But after the ending of it, I was left...wanting. But even with the disappointment I did feel, I still think I thought it was better than it was because I read it all at one time.<br /><br />That being said...Beautiful Darkness, I didn't read in one sitting. As a matter of fact, I had several opportunities to put it down. And put it down I did. It wasn't that I disliked the book. That wasn't it at all. Honestly, I just didn't feel much of anything one way or the other. It wasn't that the whole time I was reading it I was thinking \\"this is such a crappy book, I hope it gets better.\\" But I also wasn't thinking, \\"Oh my goodness, what happens next?\\" either. I have to think that not feeling anything is not quite as bad as hating a book, but it does say something about it when you don't feel anything after (or during) reading it.<br /><br />This book was different than book one. Book one followed Lena and Ethan's journey up to her \\"Sixteenth Moon\\" where she's supposed to be Claimed for Light or Dark. She supposedly doesn't have a choice, yet at the end we find that she can choose. If she chooses Light all of the Dark Casters in her family will die, including her beloved Uncle Macon--who tries to fight the Darkness--and her misguided cousin, Ridley--who was like her sister before Ridley's Claiming. In this book, book two, we follow Lena and mostly Ethan's journey up to Lena's \\"Seventeenth Moon\\" where she in essence finally does choose. I won't ruin it one way or the other. But at the end of book 2, Beautiful Darkness, it say something about the fact that if Ethan was paying attention he would hear the new song playing \\"Eighteenth Moon.\\" And honestly, that just left me feeling depressed. I guess the numbered moons are supposed to be the theme between the books in the series, but I just feel like Eigteenth Moon, or Beautiful Chaos (book three that is already out), is going to follow the pattern of the last two books. And more than anything, I just want to be done with the numbered moons, and this series. I know, sounds harsh. Just telling you how I feel.<br /><br />But, I never feel like I can abandon a series without seeing it through to the end, so I will read Beautiful Chaos at some point. I just really have no idea when, and I can't say I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br />P.S. I also just finished reading Lament by Maggie Stiefvater. Beautiful Darkness had 503 pages and Lament had 325. SO much more happened (or at least it seemed that way) in Lament than in Beautiful Darkness. Just saying...won't ruin it one way or the other.

B005VR9328|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />I come to this album as one who knows nothing of The Roots beyond the few dozen times I've been flipping channels and decided to watch a bit of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  Based on their work on that show I knew they were an incredibly talented and versatile band, and this, their latest studio album, is simply further evidence of that fact.<br /><br />Unlike many of their more popular peers, this is not simply a vehicle for a few hot singles with some filler in between.  This is a real \\"record\\" in that old school sense of the word - a collection of carefully crafted songs that go well together and are meant to be experienced in order, one after another.  This is the kind of record that would sound best on a record player, or at least on a Discman with some big ol' headphones while you're pounding the city pavement or shooting down a subway line.<br /><br />On their late night television gig The Roots are a band that flies high above the anchors of musical genre and this album is no exception.  This is not really just a rap album or a hip-hop album or a soul album or a funk album or a pop album or a rock album, it's...well, it's a ROOTS album.  And it's something of a concept album, centered around one Redford Stephens, who happened into a life of crime in inner-city New York and died at twenty-five.<br /><br />The album opens with Redford dead, moves backwards to explore his story, and ends with four short, hopped-up. classical sounding instrumental tracks - a sort of \\"Redford Stephens Suite\\" to memorialize the fallen character.<br /><br />While there are rhymes and beats to please even the most primitive music fans, this is essentially rap-infused, art-flavored hip-hop for smart people, and as such it succeeds beautifully, so why not buy this now and plant The Roots latest album in your mind to see if it will grow a little?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listener
B005URRCUY|4.0|It's a Black Keys album and you pretty much know what your going to get. This is the seventh outing from the great Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach. They work in what is a somewhat restricted musical seam yet they seem to manage to squeeze every ounce of funky blues and soul base metal from its core and add their own little discoveries. It all adds up to a quality product but one in \\"El Camino\\" which adds a bit more grease and motor oil to the usual mix. The result is the creation of what is one of their best hard rocking blues barrages in sometime which does offer contrast to the more laidback \\"Brothers\\" album. Equally the bands honorary third member Dangermouse (Brian Joseph Burton) is at the control desk again and has decided to place a welcome emphasis on the pop hooks in these 11 great songs and for once the bass player gets a proper look in.<br /><br />It all kicks off with two thumpers the overpowering \\"Lonely boy\\" and the brilliant \\"Dead and gone\\". It all sounds effortless with the former containing a killer sing-along chorus and a pounding fuzzy riff while the latter contains .......ahem, a killer sing-along chorus and pounding fuzzy riff! A great start and the foot is barely taken off the gas with the glam rock of \\"Gold on the ceiling\\" which you can almost visualise the great Marc Bolan singing in the heyday of T Rex. The pace cools for the initially acoustic \\"Little black submarines\\" gently sung by Auerbach but breaks out into a massive electric beast halfway through with a riff that does echo Tom Petty's \\"Mary Jane's last dance\\". It's a real standout track and followed by keepers like \\"Money maker\\" and the funky \\"Run right back\\". The track \\"Sister\\" sounds like one of those classic tracks built for FM rock radio which you imagine that Paul Rodgers could happily cover. It could easily be a single although there is plenty of competition, while the soulful \\"Hell of a season\\" might just be the best track on the album. The final three tracks are the \\"Stop Stop\\" a sort of mix of Stax soul and garage rock, the incredibly commercial belter that is \\"Nova Baby\\" where Auerbach blues-tinged vocals are at their absolute best and the concluding song \\"Mind eraser\\" which would have happily sat on \\"Attack and release\\".<br /><br />Granted there is little new ground broken here and \\"El Camino\\" is a not a demanding listen.

B005H0IW6W|5.0|Excellent music from the past...Buble sounds great and my 88 year old mother plays this CD every morning and sings along:)
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I do agree that they should have had both the theaterical version and this newer version on the same discs. Blu rays have the space, but the new movies are great in their own ways and the  newer effects are better. I personally would love to see lots of movies with a new effects option and the original effects on the same disc.  why not?  but I did buy this set and therefore I can say that this version is a great version and that's that. purists have a right to be angry but this set isn't for purists.  The story is still the same and the changes which I don't like are small. So that's it. the blu rays look awesome though, magical even. There's plenty of extras too and I will get the other set eventually. So star wars forever!
B000JML7YC|4.0|So it's time to review another classic. Ugh, these are probably the hardest ones to review for me. I'd give Northanger Abbey 4 Stars. I did like this book and it definitely had moments where I was extremely curious to know what was going to happen next, but as with all of Jane Austen's novels that I have read thus far, there are moments that are more boring in nature and therefore allow me to put the book down easily.<br /><br />The more I read of Jane Austen's writing and the more familiar I am with other works from the same time period, the easier it is to read these works. I'm more familiar with the phrasing and general canter of her writing style than I once was, but sometimes I still have to slow down in order to absorb what it is that she's trying to say.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey's heroine, Catherine, appears to me to be surrounded by several people who's speech is contradictory to their actually feelings or actions, Isabella, John Thorpe, and Mrs. Allen. And Catherine herself appears to me to be one of the most ignorant of Jane Austen's heroines. I don't mean that in a bad way necessarily. It's just that Catherine doesn't always know what is proper and usually defers her own judgment to those around her assuming that they know better than she does. While Catherine does appear perceptive in some cases, as in disliking John Thorpe very early on, she also appears the opposite in other cases, such as Isabella's true nature as well as John's supposed attraction to herself.<br /><br />I like the fact that while Jane Austen's heroines seem to be similar in some ways, they all have very different circumstances and experience which makes each story very much unique to itself. I do find that there has been in at least 3 of the novels that I've completely finished a character that I wholly dislike...and it's usually the one that talks the most about things they know nothing about. In this case, it's Isabella Thorpe. One thing I was disappointed in was the ending. It's not that she didn't satisfy my desire to know what happened or that I wasn't pleased with the end result;  however, she essentially summarized the ending rather than letting the reader experience it as it happened.<br /><br />Anyway, a short read, but well worth it if you're an Austen fan. If not, I wouldn't suggest reading this one first, but work up to it.my desire to know what happened or that I wasn't pleased with the end result;  however, she essentially summarized the ending rather than letting the reader experience it as it happened.

B004LROUNG|5.0|This is my first Amazon book review.  Almost passing this book up, I decided to take a chance as I enjoy reading about ambulance chasers.  This is by far, my favorite Gresham novel.  Like others, I laughed right along with and at the Three Stooges.  What wonderful characters Gresham portrayed, I felt like I was a part of the action.  And, thank you Mr. Gresham for talking about clinical trials, which is completely ignored in the US.  And thank you for giving me a much-needed good read with humor and honesty.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I like much about it, but it is SERIOUSLY lacking in needed symbols. How hard is it to add a next page with many more symbols? The lack of the option to add a change keyboard button on this keyboard further exacerbates the problem.
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|EVIL DEAD 2 has been the junk food of choice for movie geeks who have dutifully eaten all of their nutritious helpings of Bergman and Ozu.  As such, we've seen I don't know HOW many editions on VHS and DVD, but the Blu-ray puts them all to shame.  I was impressed with THE EVIL DEAD Blu-ray, which restored colors and details lost on previous editions, but I am SERIOUSLY impressed with the transfer for ED2.  I never, NEVER thought the original negative HAD this much detail in the frame as you'll find; given the budget it had, I figured it would have a softer look in it's native form, but there are details and line sharpness that I haven't seen in a film of this type of age since THE SHINING Blu-Ray.  And when I say sharp, I MEAN SHARP.  I had a hard time believing that I was watching a film from 25 years ago because--aesthetics aside--it hasn't aged a DAY.  Sure, there's flaws in the optical effects that haven't been AS visible before, but aside from an occasional film nick, it's practically cherry.  The special features are plentiful, some recycled, some new, but the new making-of documentary really goes for the \\"Dangerous Days\\"-level of gratification and coverage for fans.  No deleted scenes, but there's lots of remarkably well-preserved BTS video footage included.  Nevertheless, the disc loses a star for two small reasons.  One: the film isn't as bright as previous editions.  While the image clarity is beyond superb, the brightness has been dialed down a bit--possibly intentionally--for the purposes of mood.  I've compared footage from the Blu-ray to the DVD and there are times (most notably the laughing room sequence) where the DVD is brighter and shows some more shadow detail than the Blu-ray.  This looks to me as an intentional color-correction for the purposes of atmosphere.  It's merely irksome, but not problematic or endemic, and the detail REALLY compensates for it.  Two: more than ever, the grain is very apparent in the image.  Low-lit scenes with film grain are nicely textured, if OCCASIONALLY a bit thick.  Thankfully, it's not too distracting.  What can be a bit distracting is that the film grain isn't as noticeable as the GROUND GLASS GRAIN from the lenses.  You'll see this mostly in the title and final sequence, but it tends to exist intermittently throughout the film.  Instead of seeing the grain from the film, you'll see the actual texture from the glass in the lenses on the camera, which can give it a slight matte feel that bothered me a little more than it should.  Mostly though, the film image is extremely crisp.  As a fan, the ED2 Blu-ray did not disappoint me and for $11 (I paid $9.99 on sale) they're practically GIVING it away.  So grab it up!
B004RE29PO|5.0|Somany movies have been thrown out on blu ray with no work done on them, their colors fading, even worse , lines and scratches on them!! THis is the opposite of that they really did a great job creating a quality blu ray here. This looks brandnew and the extras are good, it's everything a blu ray should be and of course this is one of the best sci fi movies of all time. Much better than avatar! Now if only they would fix teminator and galaxina and kellys heroes and other releases on blu that look awfull.  THe story of a crew fighting aliens is brilliant and the cast is A list. So there you have it , sell your dvds and get this series on blu ray. I  have them all and I can say that others need to take notice on the blu ray done correctly that this one represents.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Works great on Tmobile G2 even with its small  screen. This app must be amazing on the larger screen of a tablet.  This is a great creativity application,  very intuitive, easy to use, great graphics and worth every penny.
0670022950|5.0|this is one of the best books i have read in a while.  it is well organized and insigthful.  it's full of graphs and data to back up its point.  that may be dry to some readers.  it's also a bit long.  but there is a sense of humor in the presentation.  and i just found the subject fascinating.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I was a little hesitant when buying this because it wasn't completely new so when I got it and played it it played great. Great seller Thank you very much
B005VW4Q70|5.0|The soundtrack of Puss In Boots is quite a mix of Zorro, Western films like The Good The Bad And The Ugly  and a kid-friendly film. And this mix works very well, considering that Antonio Banderas played Zorro in two movies (albeit the films are not my favourite incarnation of Johnston McCulley's swashbuckling hero, but that's another story) and once again reprises his role as Puss In Boots, the swordfighting lovable cat from Shrek 2. (My favourite bit from Shrek 2 is when he's fighting the guards during the film's climax-shame it was too brief). Once you hear the first track, you have a pretty good idea of what Mr. Jackman has in store for you. If you loved the movie, I think you'll fall in love with the score as well. \\"What can I say? I was a bad kitty.\\" The ending of the film just screams, \\"SEQUEL.\\" And I sure hope there IS one...
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Doesn't work on my galaxy nexus. it freezes every other level. Please fix this!!! But I love this game. it worked great in my nexus s.
B002WY65W4|4.0|There have been alot of zomedies through the years, many are very lowbudget affairs like 'ah zombie' and many others. This is a high budget movie and has top notch effects but it is still a comedy. zombie fans may not like it on that ground. I liked it though and enjoyed it's silliness. The blu ray looks fine and I don't do plots much on reviews because you don't need spoilers. If you like zomedies you'll like this one probably. Woody harrelson does a good job in this one and in some movies I think he comes off as a stoned man when he shouldn't , this time it works fine.
B0067DBHBU|5.0|Just AMAZING... Every song tells a different story.  I loved the first two albums but this one by FAR is the best!
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Great follow up album.  Finds new direction for songs without alienating fans who grew to love the sound on her first album.  Strong female lead songstress.  Also amazing live in concert if you ever have the chance to see her.
B00005JLXE|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this movie.  I don't even know where to begin.  Call me a purist for the comic books but I am tired of characters who were not dark being turned into anti-heroes because of a trend.  I miss heroes who actually are heroes.  For me a man who hunts down and tortured criminals by crippling them and then taunting them before a train hints them, just because the person was lucky enough to win against them in a court of law, is no hero at all.  Also wouldn't someone have noticed by now that anyone who wins against him in court seems to die about a night later?  I miss when Mat Murdock defended the innocent, not stalked and killed like a sadist like The Punisher.  Another issue I have is with Electra.  We're talking about a woman who started to beat up a blind man in a playground in front of children just because he followed her and was apparently crushing on her.  That's not even remotely sane.  What if he had just been some random blind man?  I laothe Collin Ferrell's acting, he was part of what destroyed Fright Night's remake (besides a terrible script).  This Daredevil movie was just horrible, pointlessly dark and twisted.  I wish one day that they would do a Daredevile movie that followed the comic books.  Maybe some day people will want heroes who actually have a sense of right and wrong again...
B005COO1X6|1.0|Being an avid fan and long distance traveler, and knowing how he can create characters, MILE 81 just sucks.  This from a man who wrote the best end of the world novel ever, and best old school vampire novel.  steve...slow down.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I like this better than the weather channel because it lets you see local radar. I did not have any problem setting it up.
0316113077|5.0|This is one of my favorite baking books for decorating ideas. I was just expecting cakes since the title says cakes. But it has much more including cookies, cupcakes, mini cakes, and cakes. So far I've done some of the cookies and the cupcake ideas and they were pretty easy and turned out cute.
0156030306|5.0|arrived early and also in great condition. No problems with shipper. Just what we expected to receive and before we expected it
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I have been listening to this album nonstop for an entire month! Love it...especially Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. This album just puts me in a good mood. What more can you ask for?!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|One major strike against Android is the lack of an awesome rss reader a la Flipboard for iOS--well, for the Kindle Fire the wait is over. Feedly's interface is perfectly minimalist while preserving a magazine like feel. It's not quite five stars yet due to the UI which is decent, but not as refined as intuitive as it should be (for instance, I couldn't for life of me figure out how to save articles for later). Freely, already great, should only get better as the devs refine the application.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|My husband has this app on his IPod and it is really slick. No local radar maps in this version. Lots of data but not very helpful without radar
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This set was great! I watched it all in about four days. The first part of the season was slow, especially the pirate episode, but it picks up a lot near the middle. Smith is my favorite Doctor and this season is great for him. You get to see some the the Doctor's dark side, which I found to be really cool. I would recommend this set for anyone who is a fan of Doctor Who or Matt Smith. I'm really glad I got it. I've watched all the episodes and special features multiple times through already. It's totally worth it.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|I don't know why this app shows up as compatible to Kindle Fire because its not. It requires a calendar database on the OS but obvious the Kindle Fire doesn't have that at the moment. Amazon should remove this app from the Kindle Fire app store to prevent others from being confused.<br /><br />Otherwise, its the best calendar app I've found on Android so far.
0385732554|4.0|this book is a great view on a utopian society that was more dystopian than anything. the only reason i marked off 1 star was the $0.50 sticker on the cover and one page was slightly off, causing about half of the letter on the right hand side of the page to be cut off. only 1 page that i have noticed so far
0792839749|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was a little girl and I wanted to share it with my grandchildren.  I had a VHS tape of the movie, but it was faulty from years of viewing.  So glad to find it on DVD!
B001QWBM62|5.0|its great! wat can i say the zoom h4n is the best digital recorder u can get... dnt worry about the price cus it well pay for itself!
B0002O06N0|5.0|If you are sick of overproduced music, this is the band for you.  If you are tired of songs carefully crafted to offend as few (or as many) people as possible, this is the band for you.  If you want to feel the raw edges of life in your music, this is DEFINITELY the band for you.  I stumbled across this album by mistake, but wow, it was just about the best mistake I've ever made.  There isn't a weak track on it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app.  not sure why others have issues. maybe they don't understand how to use the app.  you have to hold your finger down on the video you want to download.  after a few seconds you will get a pop up that gives you different options.  this is where you select how to get what you want, video, mp3, ect.  once selected your download begins.  simpleas that.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This story made me laugh out loud and cry just a little. The way the orphans were treated broke my heart, and the special note from the author really shocked me. I had to look at the year a second time to make sure it really said 1990 and not 1890.   The ending was one of the best I've read in a while, but I can't explain what made it so good without giving too much away.
B000000IR8|5.0|Blind Faith (Mobile Fidelity Gold Disk):  The Blind Faith album is a classic.  If you don't have it, you ought to get it.  This Gold Disk is excellent but it has no bonus tracks and it is now more expensive than it's worth.  Instead of buying a now overpriced Gold disk, I suggest you get the 2 CD Deluxe version, or at least get an inexpensive CD with just the original 6 tracks (that's all you really need anyway).
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Great family film; showing what can be achieved when you have perseverance and great belief. Cannot believe the swing round in feelings from her arch enemy in the surfing competition.
0439023513|2.0|First, I absolutely loved her first book. Surpassingly excellent. Catching Fire was good, not as great as the first, but nothing to complain about.  Now, the first thing is that the book is a little bit droll IMO. The biggest thing is the inconsistencies in character with Katniss. She says one thing, does another. Does one thing, says another.  Now, as far as my pure opinions go, I did not like how she is constantly using everyone around her to further her goals or happiness. We saw none of that in the first books. Her rebellion and total inability to take orders was not so prominent in previous books, and just ends up getting more people hurt or killed here. I found myself hating Katniss whereas in previous books I hung on her every word. Overall, I found the book (mainly the ending) to be rather depressing.  I got it cause I wanted to finish such a great series, and cause I hoped to prove the negative reviews wrong. But here I sit.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Why must it see my phone call log, or see the other applications that are running?  It worked fine before these updates, so why are they needed now?  I uninstalled from my phone until they change that tactic.
B001E45XT4|4.0|This is a very well constructed headset, it is a closed ear type although it is not a noise canceling headset. You can use this headset for long periods comfortably. The sound quality is good for the price range, but if you are looking for studio quality you won't want this headset. I have had my headset for a couple of weeks now and use it on google hangouts everyday for 1 to 2 hours at a time. I would recommend this headset to anyone wanting it for chat or gaming type uses. It is OK for music listening but just OK.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Crosby, Stills & Nash (Atlantic Gold Disk - 1993 - remastered by Joe Gastwirt):<br /><br />The Album: This is a solid classic, simply one of the best.<br /><br />The 1993 Gold Disk:  Contains the original 10 tracks (no bonus tracks) and is beautifully remastered.  It is worth the trouble to seek this one out.<br /><br />There is a new remastered CD release of the album which contains bonus tracks.  I have not heard the bonus tracks from this release but it might be worth checking out.<br /><br />There is a new Gold Disk being released in December of 2011.  I have no information about it other than that.<br /><br />The Crosby, Stills & Nash album easily earns five stars.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I wish everyone could see this movie.  It is so uplifting and inspiring in many different areas.  I cried, and I never cry in movies.  I wish more movies like this would be produced.  Support this movie, and show Hollywood there's a market for good, clean, moral, uplifting movies!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|page transitions smoother on tablets that previous version. magnifying glass when highlighting is soft of cool. zooming into small images still stinks. The upscaling of the images is very poor.
0061743526|5.0|I was required to read this book freshman year of high school and i'm glad I did because it changed my life. If I wasn't required to read it probably would have never have. It takes place in the south when racism is still heavily present and the langauge does get a little salty at points but it's not all that bad. It was a little dry at first but once you get to part two you're completley sucked in. The court scene was the part that changed my life. I absoultely adored Atticus Finch he's what inspired me to want to be a lawyer. This is an amazing read i say it's a great book to read late august early september. If you're thinking about reading it READ IT!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|very well made. I like the UI, I like the selection of art supplies, and I like the ease of use. I like this app :-)
B00005R8FI|5.0|John Mayall/ The Turning Point:  The song, \\"Room to Move\\" is a terrific song but the whole album is equally terrific.  Great songs, great blues, great musicianship, all of this equals a solid five-star album.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|Hoping to listen to a high quality album deliver by an artist with high standard, the disappointment is big. As a audio engineer I can´t understand an album with such a discrepancy in music production and sound quality. Some tunes sound good, some fine and some sound like a demo. The staff in this album is \\"Major League\\" supposedly but the true is that it´s not. The Mastering is done in one of the finest houses there is but evidently the work has to be done and the tweak has to be made. Obviously the mixes are different from producer to producer. This is why records made by mayor labels are treat without any care and people and artist prefer to go independently. It´s a shame because Michael performance is good and the repertoire is what you expect.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|very nice app! my 1 year old loves doodling on the phone. this is awesome! love the color, type varieties and stickers? nice~
B003Y5H57E|3.0|This movie has big star power and a lot of heart, so what is it lacking? Plain and simple...its boring. Aside from a marvelous twist, the movie crawls along at a snails pace and makes a 2 hour movie feel like 4. However, we all know you're only watching it to savor the sight of Ryan Gosling with his shirt off, and in that aspect, this movie shines in spades.
B00364K6YW|2.0|[..]    I do not know what went wrong, but I am missing the remaing of this movie.  Only 2 discs were inside the Cover of this movie. The movie ending with Mr. Darcy leaving to find Lydia ! and that was it ! no more disc was inside the cover. Does this movie come with more than one part ? Like I said, when I received the DVD ,  something was missing .Surely this was not all of it!!!! Went back to check on Amazon, to make sure that I did not overlook Part 2 , but nothing was there to order. I love this movie, and was very dis-app    ointed that I did not receive the complete movie. Take my advice and stay with the one starring karen Knightly !
B000002KOJ|5.0|Joni Mitchell/ Clouds:  Her first album was brilliant.  This (her second) is even better than that.  This album includes her great \\"Chelsea Morning\\", \\"Songs to aging Children Come\\" and \\"Both sides now\\" songs.  The remaining songs on the album are just as strong.  This is a Masterpiece, and her next few would be even better.
0385535139|5.0|I received my order in a very timely manner.  The book was very good.  In fact, one of the best that John Grisham has out.  I have read all of his books and enjoyed most of them, but this one was very good.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Very happy with this product. Came in a timely manner and in very good condition. DVDs were not scratched and case was fully intact. Watch this quite a bit and can't wait for Season III to come out on DVD...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Played more than any other game. It's easy, intuitive and fun. Great for when you have some time to kill.
B006C45CFG|5.0|Not a boring moment. I'd say this is one of the better sci-fi movies made recently. It's a good shoot 'em up adventure.
B001VZY4MS|4.0|Neil Young (self titled): This album has his great songs, \\"The Loner\\" and \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\".  The rest of the album is nice, but there is not enough here to give it five stars.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I'm want to start by saying that I  LOVE Michael Bublé. I've been listening to him for years now, been to his concerts...he's just amazing.   For the most part- I love this CD. One song I just don't like is his version of Santa Baby. I think it's kind of cheesy.   And like I said in my title- I HATE the song Feliz Navidad- but listening to Michael Bublé and Thalia (LOVE HER!) sing it, I absolutely love it. I listened to it on repeat on the way home from work.   Get the cd, it'll be a great addition to your Christmas collection.
B004XNGKBS|2.0|I like the idea of scaling as I write and fitting the words into lines, but the application is poorly done with details: the words cannot automatically wrap at the end of lines; rotating the screen sets 'paper' into a different size; the 'paper' does not scall up as you write, so you have to write on top of what you have written.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Elsewhere on this page ,someone said that he has had enough of Ryan Adams, and that he was 'movin on',  I respect the mans choice ,but I sure as hell do not understand it  ...  mate,  you move on....  im movin back ! .<br /><br />I was bored stiff by  Cardinalogy and Easy Tiger  , having loved all of his earlier albums  both solo and with Whiskeytown... i even  enjoyed a lot of 111/1V  , but after the two aforementioned  albums above , i too was ready to move on ...<br />Im so happy that i gave the great man another chance... because ,yes, much to my relief and surprise ... he is great all over again.<br />I love and adore this album , it is filled with songs of rare and tender beauty  ... If i have one complaint , I would have prefered just a little less of Norah Jones, Hey , i like a plaintive piano , but  I simply prefer an unaccompanied acoustic guitar.<br />'Heartbreaker' is my favourite album of this century.<br />That said  , the songs here which have elements of 29 ,Jacksonville and Cold Roses are some of the most beautiful creations Ryan has yet bestowed upon us. I was ready to walk away , if anyone out there is reading this , and feels as I did , a little let down by recent albums, I truly and wholeheartdly recommend that you buy this album .<br />I say that as a fan of Ryans 'better'  musical output , not everything has lived up to the high standards he set himself with Whiskeytown and his earlier solo work  ...  but Ashes & Fire  , is a brilliant return to form .<br />Buy it , Do yourself a good turn ; ).<br /><br />P.S.- Just listen to Amazons 30 second samples, I wouldn't want to steer anyone wrong,we all have our own individual tastes, This 'review' started out as a retort/comment to a review not far from here : ) , And a guy is entitled to refer to my fave album of 2011 ,as 'Cardboard' if he sees fit.... but this album has restored my faith in Mr.Adams , it's that good. Yup , listen to the samples..they will provide enough for you to decide ,if this album ,is to your liking , or not ? .
B005Y841QC|2.0|It seems that the writers ran out of ideas. This episode mimics most of their episodes. String of gruesome murders, find the witches/demons/thing responsible and then...LET THEM GO after doing some couple counseling for infidelity and lack of communication. Sam and Dean who bested many demons and the devil...well they couldn't kill two witches because their tricks didn't work so they gave up. I was initially excited to watch it because of James Marsters (who is looking way older than his age) and Charisma Carpenter as prior actors on the series, Angel. However, they were not believable as a couple and had no chemistry. So sad, this season is their least impressive. Lots of cliche comments about emotional issues through these episodes and dwelling on the their impotence to do anything. There is no theme for this season, except chasing after and spying on indestructible Levathians. Seriously, where is the oomph? It's getting more boring by the episode, I think I'll pass on the rest.
B000002KOO|5.0|Fleetwood Mac/ Then Play On:  This is a Masterpiece.  \\"Oh Well\\" alone makes this CD worth buying but the entire album is fantastic.  This is the best of the Blues based Fleetwood Mac albums and one of the best albums of all time.  The one thing this album needs is remastering.  It is true that the album has a rough sound to it anyway (and intentionally so) but it certainly didn't intend to sound as rough as the current CDs present it (as of 2011).  However, even with the problems of the current CD versions of it, you owe it to yourself to get this fantastic album.  They may or may not get around to giving this album the audio respect it deserves, but don't deny yourself the pleasure of hearing this album in the meantime.  This album is a Masterpiece and worthy of a Sixth Star.
B000H6SXMY|1.0|Gave this to my gf for her birthday and she's been watching them non-stop since she has got it. Found out today one of the discs don't play just like other reviewers reported (was hoping it wouldn't happen to us). Don't buy this box set unless you want to be disappointed like me.
B000IZA9NK|3.0|This is a film that is set in an amorphous era highly suggestive of WWII, with subject matter and imagery  (Robots) from 1930's to 1950s Sci Fi, and the look of a silent era film, most often \\"Metropolis\\".  1940's film quality and cinematography were much better than this, but it works, so who cares?  The dialog is snappy and there's actually a rather involved story that caught me by surprise.  All in all it was very entertaining even if some of it was patently unbelievable.  Ah well.  The mystery is how this didn't become a series, and it would be very nice for tv.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I had to write a review about this because I wanted to let the guys know this movie is pretty funny. Its a good go to movie date that you will enjoy.
160059672X|5.0|This book is incredible. It is a great introduction to the world of bead embroidery, and is also suitable for more advanced beaders as it gives you a closeup look at Sherri's fantastic creative process. Love it! Great photos, instructins and illutrated step by step guidelines.
B00004W510|5.0|The Band (self titled) - (Bonus Tracks): At a time when The Byrds and Dylan were making their Country albums, The Band may have even bested those efforts.  This album is not only very good, but also very fun.  The bonus tracks are nice and if you don't already have this album, this CD is the one to get.
1451648537|4.0|Very good service! My son was so excited to get this book. I had no problems with this order. He read the book as soon as he got it,
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Classic special edition bluray of a movie for the price of a rental (5.99)? Why NOT buy this. As long as you watch it once (and you'll likely watch it more), you'll have gotten your money's worth.
B004KRVDDM|5.0|I saw this film years ago, and still have fond memories of it.  It was so funny, so moving, so colorful and entertaining, that I may watch it again now.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Today is the greatest day to buy these songs. Can't wait for tomorrow, you might not have that long.  Long live the Smashing Pumpkins!!!!
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago Transit Authority (self-titled):  This was a double LP release and a truly progressive release at that.  Even if you have a `hits' collection, you won't understand the group at all until you hear this CD of the original album.  This was their first and their best.  This is a five-star CD.  As to the Rhino remaster, there is not a single thing wrong with it.
1451648537|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. As a former Apple employee, I can certainly confirm the environment of introversion and secrecy that Apple employs as a culture. Our fearless leader was no exception, and many of us viewed him with a sense of larger-than-life mystery.<br /><br />Reading through the biography I was pleased to see how much he opened up to Walt to record the unvarnished truth so that his children (and others) would know who he really was.<br /><br />Yes, there were certainly areas that could have benefited from expansion, but that's an author's prerogative, isn't it? All in all a very well written and compelling look into a very private life.
B003L77G06|5.0|Bought this on sale for $9.99. It's a great show and I picked up seasons 1&2. Would definitely recommend it for the sale price. Now I only wish the third season would go on sale...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|No more lugging two devices around!  I can now read virtually anywhere, and with a quick synch my phone and Kindle are always on the same page!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this app is fun to use, for kids and also for adults. it gives a real feeling and has a lot of options and is easy to use. great to get it free but also is worth the normal price.
B000003CM8|5.0|The Allman Brothers Band (self-titled):  This is a great five-star debut from the Allman Brothers Band.  This disk is remastered well and worth the nice price.  There is another album called \\"Beginnings\\" which has all of this album plus all of their next album on one CD for a similar price.  Either way, this album is one that ought to be added to your collection.
0446547654|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks' old books. But lately his work has gone downhill. This book, while mildly entertaining, was very predictable. The plot reminds me of his previous work as well. I would recommend you save your money and get this from the library. I did not like the ending, it was very unrealistic, very far fetched. There are so many other good authors out there to read, this one is yawn-inducing.
B000A3XY9Q|4.0|First off,if you're getting this,you've already seen the movies or someone told you to watch them.<br />If you havent and just want some funny looking DVD case,you wont regret it. Evil Dead is to Horror movies as Bach is to Classical Music. Its something you have to feast on at least once to know if you like it or not.Dont listen to personal views or busted revies on websites...<br /><br />Its campy,sure.Its not really scary anymore by our standards BUT God-damn is it good ;D The \\"Chin\\" Bruce Campbell stars as a simple guy,stuck in a forest cabin surrounded by evil (and low on gas,but thats much later) with his only key to life is a chainsaw,an ol' dual-barrel and a book made of human flesh.So yeah,with a description like that,you know what you're in for.<br /><br />Now,onto the important part.The DVD has plenty features on its disks,including extra footage not available on other versions of the movie (like the one with the Skull Poster cover,all-black case).The internal \\"booklet\\" is faithfully remade like the intro sequence with old,tainted pages and most of the visible pages of the Necronomicon reproduced inside it.The mouth on the soft,cotton-lined cover (YES,the whole case is squishy) has a hidden button in its mouth that -probably- speaks and curses at you...<br /><br />The reason im using -probably- is because sadly,the copy i got had MELTED batteries in it and i had to find out the hard way that it was the case by having to pretty much rip it open from the inside cover to get to the electrical parts.Its nothing irreplaceable,but its a small detail that hurts a little :(
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Great drawing app. Lots of options and I actually like using this one. Free today, but well worth the normal price of $1.99
B00001X590|5.0|Joe Cocker/ With A Little Help From My Friends:  This is a solid and rocking debut from Joe Cocker who had already earned the respect of his pears long before making the album.  That respect translated in having such artists are Jimmy Page and Steve Winwood play on several songs.  Of course, the rest of the band is pretty spectacular as well and the result is a first class Five-Star album.  There is a remastered version of this CD with two very good bonus tracks which I would go for if I were buying this for the first time.  Highly Recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app...  it's much better then other weather apps I've used. I would highly recommend it... so give it a try...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the greatest! I use it constantly, was originally a free user, and now pay happily for monthly space.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game have to get used to it then it gets better, I hold the world record score, try to beat it ik you cant
B001AKTZO6|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival/ Bayou Country:  In the late 1960's and early 1970's there were few bands (and albums) as entertaining as CCR.  This album only has seven tracks (apparently there are another three in the Bonus Tracks edition CD) but these are all Great songs and both \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" and \\"Graveyard Train\\" are around the 8 minute mark.  This is a great five-star CD.
B004FOA84A|4.0|great game but too short. I finished itinerant about 2 hours. I would have liked it more ifit had been longer.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|Wow! I thought it was awful...I can listen to X&Y and Rush of Blood to the Head all day long but this was like listening to someone screeching the chalkboard.  Flame away, that's my opinion...

B003M7BLOW|5.0|The AMD Athlon II X4 640 was pretty much the only quad core my mobo supports (its a very old GA-m57s4sli-s4 rev 2.0).<br /><br />I jumped from an Athlon X2 4000+ and have not looked back!<br /><br />I updated the mobo bios to add support for AM3 chips and this one was listed on the web site as supported.<br /><br />I bought it with low expectations as it does not have a L3 cache.<br /><br />BOY WAS I WRONG!<br /><br />This thing is a STEAL!<br /><br />I have an older system with 2X Geforce 9600GTs in SLI and it chews through Skyrim and BF3 at medium settings.<br />Street Fighter IV UAE? no problem with maxed out settings, Crysis 2? psh, easy peasy at medium.<br /><br />The heat sink is tink as is the fan but I was still able to add another 120MHZ to it with a very tame OC ending at 3.125GHZ<br />Again if you're not going to OC more than 5-8% you prolly will be fine.<br /><br />I run XP 32 with 3GB (slow DDR2 @ 333MHZ) RAM and have a couple old 5200 RPM drives hooked up and this proco pushes everything fine.<br /><br />I emulate PS2 and Gamecube pretty well with it to if you're into that.<br /><br />If like me you are looking at building an arcade machine around it go with aftermarket cooling and you should be able to hit 3.8GHZ.<br /><br />Look at the specs of my old machine, then look at the games I just listed, pick this up and you are in for a real treat!
1932735410|4.0|Rita's 7th book is almost identical to the 4th edition I got for $4. In preparation for the test I read Rita's book twice, and Andy Crowes book twice. I also took the free pmstudy.com test.  Andy Crowes book is a MUST have. Not only is it an easier read, you get a free week subscription to \\"insite\\" which was a huge help in identifying weaknesses. The book is also much cheaper than Rita's. Don't trust Andy Crowe's final. The real exam is much harder than the final in the back of the book.  Rita's book was very detailed and the questions were more similar to the real test. Also Rita's new book uses the exact same questions in each edition.   The free pmstudy test was harder than the real exam. I would say the exam was in between Rita's test and the pmstudy questions.   Buy Andy Crowe's book, and an older rita book, to get more detailed answers, and the free pmstudy test. Don't waste your money on the flashcards or the cd.   General Test notes: Due to the Aug 1st changes to the test, I assumed that the test questions were going to be completely different from the practice questions. I couldn't tell that there was a change. Professional responsibility questions seemed stand alone, and not mixed with other processes.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Yes, there was so much potential here but no dice. What an awesome cast they got together and they let it all sink down to a mediocre film at best. The biggest problem was that a good chunk of the humor just wasn't that funny. In fact, the gags running at the end were funnier than half of the humor attempts in the actual film. Tale focuses on three male friends who are under the thumb of horrible bosses and come up with the idea to have them all murdered.  In the end it doesn't turn out as expected but they all get their revenge and yeah most of us saw it coming this way.  Yawn and lawl. Good soundtrack. It cost $37M to make and yielded over $200M at the Box Office. This is one of those rare moments when I agree with the critics over the masses. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; HUMOR: C to C plus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.

1466401885|5.0|I stumbled across Beautiful Disaster back in October, I was looking at reviews and before I even read the book I was completely intrigued. Then I sadly found out that Beautiful Disaster was only available in kindle. Thinking my curiosity would be satisfied by reading just the first couple pages of BD, I did the whole 'Click to look inside' thing, which only made matters worse. From page one of Beautiful Disaster I was hooked, I felt as if I'd been thrown back in time to when I was in college. So, when I found out the author was making this book available in paperback I bought it right away! I never buy books full price, but this one was worth it!!  For me a good book must elicit emotions.  If a book makes me feel something then I am probably going to be a fan, and Beautiful Disaster made me feel a lot of things! Travis and Abby are both very flawed characters. Each of them did things that frustrated me, and upset me throughout the book, and their chemistry and sexual tension was another thing that I could feel as well!   I'm seriously having a hard time writing this review because I liked this book so much! Even though BD had its flaws, I really don't feel like pointing them out, because when it comes down it this book had every thing I wanted. I could feel what the characters were feeling, and even though I didn't agree with everything that happened in this book, I understood all the choices that the characters made. At times Travis was totally crazy and I loved that! McGuire did some brave things with him (and with Abby), and because of that this book was never predictable!  Like many other reviewers I have read Beautiful Disaster multiple times since buying it. And I can honestly say this book wasn't quite like any book that I have ever read (and I read quite a bit). The only book that it sort of reminded me of was [[ASIN:0440423201 Outlander (20th Anniversary Edition): A Novel]], and I say that not because the stories are similar -they are not at all. But therewas something about the way the characters interacted in both books, the level of passion they had when they fought with each other,  or maybe it was they way they seemed to need each other... I don't know. But I do know that I loved this book!   On that note, I wouldn't say this book is for everyone. Beautiful Disaster did have quite a bit of bad language and sexual content, and if you like books that display healthy relationships this story is not for you. On the other hand if you like stories with Alpha males and dysfunctional relationships then you will probably love this book. And I hope you do!
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Words fail me. They just won't do this book justice no matter which ones I choose in the attempt to describe it only to come up short. You simply HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK! Wow! Ms Perkins has gained a fan for life in me. I will most definitely read anything she writes (I'm diving straight into Lola and the Boy Next Door straight away!). This book had me daydreaming, laughing, and anxiously counting down the minutes until I could resume diving back into it's beautiful pages, and I read it in two sittings and only because I had to go to work! Thank you Me. Perkins for such a beautifully written story. All I can say is Etienne, Etienne, Etienne!!
B0068TJLSY|3.0|Set in the 70s and focused on a group of kids making a zombie movie who stumble upon something they weren't meant to know. The characters are nicely fleshed out and there's a definite sense of melancholy and even poignancy at times. In fact, I'd say the characters are the best part about this movie. The introduction of the alien and the ending resolution feels half baked, though. The end credits was done nicely. This film cost $50M to make and yielded close to $260M at the Box Office. A great deal of the advertising of this film early on was done through viral marketing.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; RESONANCE: B; CGI: B; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B
B006BXT4TI|5.0|As a huge Black Keys fan, I've always loved their bluesy, gritty, enormous sound. I had heard that this album would go in a different direction with more upbeat rhythms but I wasn't worried in the least. After listening to this album four times on repeat, I can honestly say this is probably my favorite album that they've made.  It's still a wall of filthy sound which is what I love about them, but there's something more refined and hopeful about the songs.  You'll be tapping your feet and wanting to dance to a lot of the songs like the dude from the awesome \\"Lonely Boy\\" video. Even their acoustic song \\"Little Black Submarine\\" is different than other Black Keys acoustic jams from the past, with this awesome Led Zeppelin-y type feel.   I'm not a music reviewer by any stretch, but I know that this album made me feel happy, made me want to share it with all my friends who don't know/like the Black Keys, and made me glad that they're continuing to evolve into new sounds and genres while somehow sounding distinctly Black Keys.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|The cm storm is a very well crafted mouse especially for its price, almost every button can be customized through cool masters driver program that comes with it. The only issue I have had with it isn't its fault, everytime I reboot my pc I have to unplug and replug in the mouse for windows to recognize that it is even their. The other issue again isn't the mouses fault butt is very hard to get use to if you previously were using a razer nags.
0307712508|5.0|Our book club chose this book recently. We are all fascinated by the story and impressed with the writing. The characters became more tangible as the story progressed. This was an awesome book. Highly recommended...

B005H0IW6W|3.0|I've been listening to MB's Christmas a lot...<br /><br />...but not necessarily for the right reason. Let me start out by saying that I'm a big Bubl&eacute; fan ... not a gushing fanboy but I genuinely enjoy the vast majority of his work. I've seen Michael several times over the past few years ... the guy puts on a super show and he's done a great job bringing a lot of energy and attention to the American Songbook.<br /><br />So it's with a heavy heart that I tell you I'm a little disappointed with his Reprise Records Christmas - Michael Bubl&eacute; release. Michael delivers some outstanding MB renditions of holiday favorites here, but too few to float this album into the top tier of standards holiday albums ... (another cringe).<br /><br />The bottom line is that of the fifteen songs on the track list, only five stand out as top notch MB winners to me. There are a couple of  additional numbers that are solid ... the other eight tracks don't suck (well, with the exception of the \\"White Christmas\\" duet with Shania Twain ... oh my) they just come in somewhere between nice-ish numbers to phoned-in meh.<br /><br />But the good is very good indeed so let's go there...<br /><br />The classic songs...<br /><br />..is where Bubl&eacute; hits his stride on this album. After opening with a \\"just OK\\" version of \\"It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas\\", Michael cranks out a superbly arranged and very MB version of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\". He follows it up with a cool up-tempo \\"Jingle Bells\\" accompanied by the lovely and talented Puppini Sisters adding some fun Andrews Sisters spice to the 'bells mix... very cool!<br /><br />Then it's off to track eight for \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\". Here MB plays it traditionally straight but this song just sets up perfectly for Michael's vocal style and the string arrangements compliment him in fine fashion.<br /><br />Sticking with the stellar slice of the track list, I was dumbstruck by MB's version of \\"Silent Night\\". Again a basically straight-up rendition with virtually no embellishment but he does a wonderful job on the vocals and again is complimented by excellent string and piano accompaniment ... and a very nice choir section. There's just not a lot of room to make a song like \\"Silent Night\\" stand out (lot's of ways to screw it up) but Michael pulls it off masterfully.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" rounds out the fab five tracks. I'm always twitchy about this number because it is a personal favorite that I don't like to see mucked with ... MB does it up very nicely. It's another song that clearly lays out there perfectly for him ... his vocals are pure and the simple guitar, piano and string arrangements are perfect. It's like MB is standing next to your fireplace singing just to you.<br /><br />Then there are the other ten songs...<br /><br />\\"Ave Maria\\" is nice ... a tough song done well. For me this song was stolen by Harry Connick Jr (When My Heart Finds Christmas) but MB does well with it here. Likewise \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" is pretty good with a lot of Bubl&eacute; feel. \\"Blue Christmas\\" was Zydeco'd up a bit too much for me but not bad ... it's growing on me.<br /><br />Most of the remaining songs are just OK from where I'm standing ... It may not be fair, but I've come to expect a high percentage of winners from Michael Bubl&eacute; albums and many of these just came off sort of phoned in or \\"not MB like\\".<br /><br />I always heard Bing Crosby hated \\"White Christmas\\"...<br /><br />... but apparently not as much as Shania Twain hates it. MB does OK with a weirdly arranged, plodding rendition, but Shania just whacks this number in the forehead with two-by-four! She sounds like a yodeling Brenda Lee wannabe ... get it out of my head!!!<br /><br />See the complete review on Vocalstandards website.rful job on the vocals and again is complimented by excellent string and piano accompaniment ... and a very nice choir section.

0307477479|3.0|Personally, I enjoyed the overall format of the novel - I liked how each chapter was a discrete story, but still linked with common characters and themes, and didn't mind the time jumping.  It was cohesive enough, for me, for it to be called a \\"novel\\" as opposed to a short story collection.  The characters were strong and memorable, the writing engaging - I sped through, and couldn't wait to find out what happened next.   The last two chapters, however, almost ruined the entire story for me.  Egan tries to paint a future world, which my best guess would place somewhere in the 2020 - 2030 range, i.e., a time not that far away and when most of her audience will still be alive.  Yet the world has become something completely different and weird, where kids no longer get tattoos or curse, \\"lawns\\" and \\"golf courses\\" are a fond memory because there's no more rain or too much sun or something, America has developed massive solar panel fields, strollers are banned in New York City, and the fact that toddlers can point and download music on some sort of iphone-like device means that they have become the arbiters of musical taste, until a crazy old guy throws a free concert and what is \\"real\\" triumphs, except it wasn't real because it was an event created by stealth marketing, except that the people who didn't know they were the victimcs of stealth marketing \\"really\\" enjoyed the event, except ... you get the idea.    I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be her actual vision of the future, or an absurdist tale.  Ultimately, it just didn't gel with the rest of the story.    As many others have pointed out, one of these look-into-the-future chapters is also written in power point.  Again, not sure what the author was trying to demonstrate - somehow I don't think powerpoint has been considered the future of communications by anyone since the 1990s, and its hard to imagine a teenager in 2020 deliberately using it to keep a diary of some sort - but it seems like one of those thingsthat was done to be deliberately provocative rather than because it added anything meaningful to the story.    Definitely worth reading - just wish the last two chapters had lived up to the promise of the begininng of the book.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|I've tried them all...started with beautiful widgets, then fancy widgets, and tried the weather channel app and weatherbug. Of course they look great, but sucked down battery and system resources. This weather application is great. it has all the pertinent information at the touch of a finger and always keeps my location. It can be a little confusing at first, but just take the time and this outshines all the others. it never force closes and doesn't slow my phone down. I have nothing bad to say about it. A+

Man the Black Key sold out\\" I feel like the more people to enjoy there music with the better! Fans like you have already ruined Dave Mathews please don't do it to the the Keys! Every album they made rocks in its own way. This Cd rocks. Ive seen the keys over 20 times every show they did Rocked. My personal favorite shows were Summerfest and the four New Years Day New years eve shows in Chicago. lollapalooza show was cool too. This album is just as good as every other album, if not better. When they bring out the band at the shows, it's amazing. Sure the old Black Keys songs are great, but the New albums rock just as much. Every band transforms as the move through life. Stop your hating and enjoy. Im sure people said the same thing when Pink Floyds the wall came out....\\"oH this is to Disco like for me they totally sold out\\"

B005974CNA|4.0|Dream Theater's \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" is another solid addition to the catalog of the great progressive metal troupe, this time being somewhat of a different situation as Mike Mangini takes over for Mike Portnoy, who quit in September 2010 due to his need for a break not being equally desired by his bandmates.<br /><br />Dream Theater's catalog has seemed to have a similar cadence after since the epic Score concert and the album Octavarium: starting with Systematic Chaos (their first release with Roadrunner), they've seemed to have a more \\"modern metal\\" feel while also amping up tons of the prog elements (despite the clich&eacute; of Dream Theater being \\"20-minute songs\\", they only had 1 such song before the 20-odd minute tracks from \\"Systematic Chaos\\" and \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\"' back-to-back offerings. Some have complained about the Roadrunner-era change of feel, but I don't mind it and have enjoyed it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />ADTOE continues in that vein, but drops a lot of the Portnoy/Roadrunner stuff like his shout vocals and some of the more modern-metal influence, to return to a more old-school vibe in a lot of ways. All but two of the songs are argued to be based off songs off \\"Images and Words\\" (ESPECIALLY \\"Lost not Forgotten\\" which is section-for-section the 2011 dark brother of \\"Under a Glass Moon\\"), but it doesn't detract from the quality of the songs.<br /><br />The real gem off this album is the \\"Far from Heaven\\"/\\"Breaking All Illusions\\" duo - you have to listen to these two together for the full effect. FFH starts with a somber chord that gives me goosebumps right away when that chord is played. The final section of it is reprised at the end of the epic \\"Breaking All Illusions\\", which has one of the best Dream Theater choruses in a long long time. A powerful duo you need to listen to together.<br /><br />Speaking of amazing choruses, \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" may have the single best \\"poppy\\" chorus for a DT song in years - it builds from a tribal/symphonic intro, to somewhat generic but still enjoyable riffage, to this goosebump-inducing chorus. In the second and final chorus, a sort of second chorus is added that is also amazing (\\"And at last the time has come, to unite again as one...\\"). Makes for great running music.<br /><br />All in all a great addition - won't probably convert any major new fans but it's Dream Theater and it's quality music.<br /><br />On a side note, John Petrucci needs to go cleanshaven again sometime soon for a while - it's been almost 20 years since he looked like a badass in the Images & Words era with his Seinfeld-meets-Dave-Grohl cleanshaven look. It'd be cool to see that again.t still enjoyable riffage, to this goosebump-inducing chorus.

B005VR9328|5.0|First and foremost, let me say that this album is NOT something that everyone will enjoy. This is NOT made for the one dimentional radio head or the casual Hip Hop listener, and very likely go over some heads. This is not a feel good album full of club hits, love ballads, and chain music. Its a dark tale of a lost soul named Redford Stevens, who recounts the journey leading to his downfall. In short, The Roots, Undun, is art personified.<br /><br />Undun chronicles the life of Redford Stevens, a drug dealer from Philidelphia, and kicks off the album with the representation of his death with an instrumental cut, \\"Dun\\" which flows seamlessly into the first words of narration by Black Thought on \\"Sleep\\" preparing us for a journey back in time to how things got to this point.<br /><br />By the time you get to the third or fourth cut, this album starts to feel less like a Hip Hop album and more like a soundtrack to the non-existant biopic of Redford Stevens. The tracks all flow together seamlessly, with no fillers, no misplaced songs, and really no mistakes. This is probably the best example of meticulousness on a Hip Hop album I have every witnessed. It is truely a solid, unblemished classic. Everything from the dark representation of Redford's downfall through the instrumentation, the epicly super lyrical narration from Black Thought, and the guest verses from long time Roots affiliates like P.O.R.N. and Dice Raw, with some newer blood like Phonte and Big K.R.I.T.<br /><br />Its very hard to pick out any specific song as a highlight of the album. As hard as I've tried, I cant really seperate one song from the whole list, since the way I feel about each track is subsequently affected by the songs that come before it and after. The only tracks people may not take a liking to would be 12-14, which could be called a Suite, if nothing else, which paints through instrumentals the closing of the story being told. I'll spare you the blow by blow and simply encourage you to see for yourself. Depending on your tastes, these may be skip worthy, but rest assured they definitely take nothing away from the album.<br /><br /> It truely is a cohesive, well thought out piece of work. If you are a fan of The Roots, there should be no hesitation whatsoever about getting this album. Even if by some supernatural anomaly you were not a fan of the album prior to this one, How I Got Over, this here should get your attention in the best way. Even if you arnt a fan of The Roots, check this out. This is what good music is. This is what real Hip Hop sounds like. The Roots have done amazing work over the years, but with album number 14, they have not only solidified their place in the hearts of fans and critics across the board, but raised the bar for anyone who dares to call themselves a Hip Hop artist.<br /><br />Personal favorites that I managed to find are \\"Sleep\\" \\"Make My\\" feat. Big K.R.I.T., \\"One Time\\" feat. Phonte & Dice Raw, and \\"I Remember\\". I really did try to avoid listing the entire CD.<br /><br />To put it simeply, Undun is a CLASSIC!ur tastes, these may be skip worthy, but rest assured they definitely take nothing away from the album.

042524489X|2.0|This installment of the psy-changeling series dragged a bit. It started out very promising, but diminished as the story went on. I was not able to connect with the characters as in her previous stories. Hopefully the next story in this series will follow her usual style of writing.
0307959856|4.0|Death Comes to Pemberley begins six years after the close of Pride and Prejudice. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet are happily married and living at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy's Derbyshire estate, with their two young sons and Mr. Darcy's sister, Georgiana. The new book begins with a short prologue reviewing the action of Pride and Prejudice and the six years before this novel's story begins.  We then enter the great house at Pemberley on the night before the Darcys are to host their annual autumn ball. Elizabeth's sister, Jane, and Jane's husband, Charles Bingley, are already in residence, along with Darcy's cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. A new character, Mr. Alveston, is also a guest.<br /><br />The hosts and guests are ready to retire for the night when a carriage comes careening up the drive, the door bursts open and out hurtles Lydia, Jane and Elizabeth's drama queen of a younger sister, screaming like a banshee that her husband, Wickham, has been shot and killed in Pemberley's woodland. (When you heard there was a Pride and Prejudice sequel with a murder, didn't you just *know* that Lydia would take center stage in the hubbub?)  Because a murder has taken place on Darcy's estate and affects his family--no matter how distant the Darcys have always tried to keep from Wickham and Lydia--Darcy is necessarily involved in the resolution of the case.  And, of course, the personal connections make the case an emotional trial for Darcy, Elizabeth and their extended families.<br /><br />Famed mystery author P. D. James hasn't merely dressed up a mystery in Austen style. Her book is very much an exploration of Elizabeth and Darcy's characters, emotional lives and their marriage. James presents a nuanced portrait of the two that is different from the pert Elizabeth and imperious Darcy of the screen versions of Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth's new position as chatelaine of the vast estate of Pemberley and her duty to her husband, his family, their staff and the property have matured her and made her more conciliatory to troublesome characters, even the likes of Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Darcy is presented as a sometimes brooding and self-doubting man, but one who is determined to learn from his past errors and make a happy life for his family.<br /><br />Unlike many authors of Austen sequels, James hasn't populated her story with a horde of new characters. Of course, there are some new characters, but James shows, through the course of the book, that she is well-acquainted with Pride and Prejudice and the other Austen novels, and she skillfully works events and characters from those books into this one. The way she does this is true to the characters and even throws new light on their behavior and circumstances in Pride and Prejudice. She does this so well that from now on I will always think of some of the Pride and Prejudice characters as having the back story that James gives them.<br /><br />James's writing style captures the cadences of Austen and there are several passages that recall Austen's tart and ironic observations. Here is just one, about Charles Bingley's sister Caroline: \\"Miss Bingley was particularly anxious at this time not to leave the capital. Her pursuit of a widowed peer of great wealth was entering a most hopeful phase. Admittedly, without his peerage and his money he would have been regarded as the most boring man in London, but one cannot expect to be called 'your grace' without some inconvenience.\\"<br /><br />As a sequel to Pride and Prejudice, Death Comes to Pemberley is a satisfying effort. As a mystery, it is not conventional and probably not what most of us expected when we first heard about the book. Mr. Darcy doesn't suddenly put on a deerstalker hat and turn detective. But the way the story plays out is more true to the time and place, and to Austen's style, than it would have been if James had tried to bolt a detective story onto an Austen sequel. I should note, though, that this Austenworld authenticity and the lack of a detective story may mean that the book disappoints some mystery readers, including some P. D. James fans.<br /><br />As a lover of Jane Austen, if not a complete Austen fanatic, I was happy to spend this time at Pemberley, revisiting the characters from Pride and Prejudice and seeing their later lives depicted in a way that is faithful to the depth and complexity that Austen gave them. I was disappointed that there wasn't more time spent with Darcy and Elizabeth together, but that's more of a quibble than a serious criticism.k disappoints some mystery readers, including some P. D.

B000002GA8|2.0|For some of us this piece carries the sentiment of years gone by and moments cherised with others. it is melodically inspired and beautifully orchestrated.<br />So, with 50 plus reviews behind me I will just add two stars to the mix due to something already mentioned: the sound!  This is a major orchestral piece, not a loud rock outing, therefore, without even hearing the quoted Japanese remastering, it is quite obvious this needs one badly.<br />When that happens, I'll buy it (alas, again!)

B004VUP8WK|1.0|David Vincent's return to Morbid Angel marks the death of yet another Flordia Death Metal band. With Vincent in charge, Trey taking a back seat, and Pete not in the band anymore, this release can hardly be consider part of the Morbid Angel catalog. Casting aside what Morbid Angel was, and reviewing this album in its own right I still consider this album to be a release that poorly navigates death-core, and trite industrial. The tracks that are slightly bearable are only so because they use tired riffs and catchy drumming. In all, this album is the worst Morbid Angel release ever, and furthermore a fine example of the painful death of Old School Death Metal.

B000F8O35U|1.0|This item was purchased Nov 2010 as a gift for my newborn grand daughter. Well it was opened today, Dec 6th 2011 because she is finally old enough to watch. Well upon opening this item the cardboard container was very grainy and dull and when the actual plastic contaner was opened the disc were chipped and scratched. It was obvious that this was a very poorly made copy and not an origanal NEW product as stated when I purchased it. I realize it has been over a year and there is nothing I can do about it but I did trust that this item was NEW so I wasnt concerned about it being FAKE. Anyway, VERY VERY unhappy with this purchase.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is the most beautiful drawing program I've ever seen. I like to play with it as much as the children. The layout is great, and the selection of stationery, construction paper colors, stamps, and tools are wonderful. I'm so grateful that Amazon introduced this program as free app of the day, or I would have never known how great Darren Murtha Designs products are. After playing with Drawing Pad for 10 - 20 minutes, I promptly paid full price for their other two learning products for the Kindle Fire, Shape Builder and Connect the Dots. Both are worth every penny if you have young children, so check them out!

B000TSUCAQ|5.0|I bought this cookbook and its sequal \\"Darth Malt...\\" for my sister who is a big Star Wars fan.  Her reaction alone when she opened them Christmas morning was worth the cost of the books.  It was by far the star present of the day.  As she paged through the books reading the punny recipe names and looking at the photos, she was laughing so hard she was crying, which made the rest of us, who are not Star Wars geeks, laugh so hard our stomachs hurt.  Each recipe is paired with a photo of the completed recipe used as a prop in a scene with elaborate backgrounds and miniature figurines, and they are impressively well done!  And hilarious!!  Clearly a lot of loving effort was put in to creating it.  The books themselves are good quality, and the finished recipes that I've tasted have been pretty tasty too.  Perfect for a Star Wars fan who likes to cook, or even one who only cooks rarely - you don't have to be experienced to follow the recipes.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This one has the Spielberg stamp all over it from beginning to end; if you liked E.T. you'll probably like this one too. I definitely fall into that camp and did in fact have a good time with this movie. It was fun to watch, interesting, fast paced and exciting to me.<br /><br />Although it didn't develop any really new sci-fi story ideas it did a good job of handling some tried and true sci-fi plot schemes and was in several ways similar to E.T. The acting and special effects were good and the kids did a very good job of carrying the movie. As sometimes happens in this kind of movie the military and the government are painted as villains and come across as not very nice.<br /><br />In summary the story holds one's attention and the acting effectively draws the viewer into the story so the movie goes by quickly. The special effects are rather spectacular so the overall package provides an action-filled movie that is entertaining.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What more can I say to all the reviews that have already been said.  This is a reference Bluray disc that is a must have to own in anybody's library.  Not only is it 1 of the few that have scenes shot on 70mm IMAX the storyline and a/v quality is top notch.

1451648537|5.0|A biography that made me care about the person plus the tech industry, which I knew nothing about either one, gets a thumbs up from me! The book gave great insight into a man that some people say was a jerk and others say was a genius and artist. I felt the book was well balanced to show both sides. I was awed by his creative perfectionism, so much that I went into an Apple store for the first time just to see and hold the products he loved so much. I wanted to see the clean lines and edges that he lost sleep over. Before entering the store I mentioned to my daughter that Steve's favorite musician was Bob Dylan and it made me emotional to hear 'Tangled up in Blue\\" playing when we entered the store. I'm 55 years old but felt like a 19-year-old groupie! Since finishing the book I reflect back on it often, the history lesson on the tech industry, insight into running businesses, personality flaws we all have, wondering where creative drive comes from, the book has stayed with me and I would recommend it to everyone. Very well written, absorbing story.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I definitely felt like I was using more than 20% of my brain after watching this movie.  It definitely required the memory bank to delve deeper at there were multiple layers of dreams that were being explored.  Add in the fact that there was another layer that was not clear if the current reality was a dream or not, was the kicker; user interpretation determines the answer.  Definitely a great movie on it's own which is enhanced onto the Bluray disc for it's well mastered audio & video quality.  Highly recommended on Bluray as it's the best combination of storyline and movie viewing experience!

B001E2JNA6|3.0|While I enjoy the restored widescreen version of this Bluray, something went wrong. The picture is very, very grainy/pixelated. It looks like analog broadcast television.

B002XUBDVK|3.0|For starters, this is a very well done movie, with great acting, and an amazing story. That being said, I do have a few comments that people should try to remember and pay attention to. I don't work for any company, but I am well versed in the area of entertainment and media.<br /><br />1. Many movies were originally recorded well before even DVD existed, much less Blu-Ray. Much like a photo, even if you have the original master tapes or negatives, it is impossible (with current technology) to put in information that wasn't there in the first place. As an example, you could try to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to attempt at making a 640x480 photo to be full HD in quality. Unless the original image was vector art (which has no size restrictions whatsoever), it might be 1920x1080 but it will be horrible in quality. The same applies to where something was released on DVD and a few years later HD Blu-Ray came out. So, although attempts can be made, don't expect any Blu-Ray anything that wasn't made after Blu-Ray existed to have the same quality. It won't.<br /><br />2. Any remember when DVD movies first came out? If you don't, try to find a original DVD released the first year or two it was out, and what do you see? The disc is shiny and silver on both sides. Why is that? It's because back then, it was primarily just the full screen version of the move on one side and the wide screen version on the other, with no ads or anything else. Unfortunately, with people wanting a picture on one side, along with the cost of all the \\"extras\\" people want, that costs money, hence all the ads that you cannot skip through now on typical DVDs. In the case of Blu-Ray, they can hold a sickening amount of data. There is no reason whatsoever for why any Blu-Ray release to not include both the full screen and widescreen version of the theatrical release, but likewise include the extended/director's cut version. If the disc you buy doesn't, you are wasting a lot of money. Sadly, few if any Blu-Ray releases include that.<br /><br />3. Additionally, if any limited edition or collector's anything was ever released on DVD, all of those extras and special features should be on the Blu-Ray. If not, save yourself some money and just buy the special released version on DVD. You will save a good amount of cash, plus (especially on older movies), you can get nearly full HD quality from a DVD by just using a DVD or Blu-Ray player that offers 720p/1080p up-scaling.<br /><br />I think this remastered version here is a good effort, but it still lacking in a number of extras, as well as the original trailer. Unless you insist on only Blu-Ray in your library, or can find it new for less than $10.00, just get the DVD. I would personally prefer to spend the extra cash on higher quality cables and a better quality Blu-Ray player with full up-scaling versus on a Blu-Ray disc.ases include that.   3.

B0059GVBHG|3.0|Last Exit to Brooklyn-<br /><br />A movie that could of been great but wound up only being good & the description at imdb is as much wrong as it is right. Set in the Early 50's in Brooklyn it follows the actions, often without consequences, of a new Union Strike building leader who is unhappy at home with his wife & kids & takes homosexuality as his road out. It also follows a prostitute that has a small gang that rolls her customers for her. A family man played by Burt Young of Rocky fame has difficulty adjusting to his daughters pregnancy & Jerry Orbach makes an appearance, in astounding realism, as the Head of the Local for the union.<br /><br />Unfortunately the gang appears first in the show & they are toons. I expected to see them break out into song & dance like in Westside Story's Officer Krupke. It ruined the first half of this very dark & gritty movie for me. Once I got over that I realized that this probably plays better for an East Coast dweller rather a central US dweller like myself. The music is haunting, enjoyable & contrasts amazingly well with the visual images. No rating now I'll give it another look later.<br /><br />Overall it's a great cast with Jennifer Jason Leigh playing the prostitute in a manner that shows why I love her acting so much. Stephen Baldwin, Stephen Lang, Rikki Lake, Peter Dobson & Sam Rockwell appear also. I liked the show but I'm not certain how much. It's worth at least one viewing if for nothing else but JJL, Orbach & the music.

B004EPZ06Q|1.0|Yeah I pretty much agree with everyone else.  The ultra violet is a joke.  I purposely buy the blu ray/digital copy so I can have a disc for the blu ray player at home & to have in my iphone.  This ultra violet thing is something different.  You can't download it to your itunes.  You have to register your personal information through two different companies, flixster & then ultraviolet.  Then you download the flixster app to view it.  It's just not as easy or the same. I won't be purchasing anything with ultraviolet anymore. Oh yeah and since I've opened the dvd, I can't return it for just the regular blu ray copy and get my money back on the difference. Just disgusted!!!
B006B9TLT0|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about getting LIVE music form Taylor.  Seeing her on the ga-zillion music shows she's performed and has sounded HORRIBLE, and that's being nice.  Now, modern technology can make just about anybody sound good in a studio (and LIVE) but Live music tends not to be manipulated as much (mostly audience noise), but once I listened to this I was surprised!  It sounds great.  So if you're a fan of Taylor, buy this!
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I saw U2 at Soldier Field in Chicago and the band must be nocturnal because they did not come out until it was completely dark. The effects, lights, fog, etc. was incredible and it was the second time in my life (Prince was the first) that I've attended a concert and felt as if I were part of the concert instead of a fan simply viewing the artist. Guess that's what 360 degree was all about - spreading the concert-party like an airborne virus to everyone who attended. The blu-ray was pretty much identical to the concert that I saw, sure it's dark, but it was dark OUTSIDE; this concert was not inside an enclosed arena with lighting, e.g., Madison Square Garden, so I think whoever filmed, watched and edited the blu-ray copy met his or her goal - to make the viewer feel as if they're part of the show. When I watched the 360 degree concert on blu-ray, it was just as phenomenal as being one of the 61,500 sold-out screaming fans at Soldier Field. Yes, there are some trippy moments on the blu-ray, especially when they sang Vertigo. I felt as if I was experiencing equilibrium issues, the spins from too much of da sauce and vertigo all from the comfort of my sofa - AND IT WAS TOTALLY COOL!  Did I mention the singing? U2 sounds identical live as they do on radio/blu-ray/dvd/whatever your medium which is always a treat. Their lyrics and music are extremely powerful, uplifting, compelling and makes you feel blessed just to hear simple words strung together to create the most unprecedented imaginative vocal utterances in song. The power of the pen that they use while writing their songs must set the paper ablaze. I also must write that the creative genius who dreamt of the stage and lighting for the concert should receive some serious recognition - it was the most amazing concert stage setup I've seen to date. The additional footage of the blu-ray contain moments from other locations where the concerts took place. The sound is perfecto and the setup options on blu-ray are prettycool too. Only thing is, when they performed in Chicago, they sang at least 3 other songs - Gone, Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me and I Will Follow - and these songs are not on the blu-ray. Yet this blu-ray concert is completely worth adding to your musical collection.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|I have never written a review for anything.. but had to for this series. I so thoroughly enjoyed both books in this series I am having a hard time finding my next read... nothing compares!

1451627289|1.0|King is excellent at taking 2000 words to say something that would take an ordinary person 20 words to say.  Without spoiling the endying for anyone who has the stamina to make it to the end of this monstrous 800+ page novel - I will only say it is less than climactic.  Even his \\"afterword\\" was way too wordy.  King has become complacent in his fame and doesn't know how to tell a compelling story anymore.  Maybe he once did.  But, time has gotten the better of him.

1451629184|5.0|This book offers a look into the life of Jaycee Dugard from the time of her kidnapping until she was reunited with her family. It ranges in scope from free associative thought and somewhat vague descriptions to an almost vulgar description of the tortures that were inflicted on her.<br /><br />That Jaycee was able to be kidnapped at the age of eleven and was sable to survive in a fairly reasonable mental state until her discovery by police officials at the age of 29 is a testimony to the strength of this very remarkable woman. I don't believe there are many people who could endure what she did, be returned to their family and have an even semi normal life afterwards, yet it appears from this book that this has indeed happened in  this case.<br /><br />One thing I found interesting in the book was the style of writing. While Jaycee is obviously a very smart young lady, there was evidence of the lack of education beyond the time when she was kidnapped and the self learning that she did. At times the writing is almost childlike, which would be the case as she was kidnapped during her fifth grade year.<br /><br />One thing that may frustrate readers not fully familiar with the case is the lack of detail about the case from the outside perspective. Of course, it is obvious that she would not know anything that happened outside the compound after her kidnapping, so it might be helpful for the reader to also read another book about the case, [[ASIN:0312388276 Lost and Found: The True Story of Jaycee Lee Dugard and the Abduction that Shocked the World (St. Martin's True Crime Library)]]<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all. It is a story of survival, strength and a form of catharsis for this young lady and there is a message in the book that is applicable to all of us....never give up.

B0050LJIRK|5.0|I want to start off by saying, \\"this is not for the LB haters, so turn around and stop reading\\". Now that is out of the way, let's get to it. This album is not a re-invention of the music wheel or anything like that. This album is a Limp Bizkit album. I can tell Wes Borland is back (thank god, or what ever being you look up to). I can say this, IMO, I think this album rocks and it shows progression. I think Fred should give up the childish rap, but a bit sounds okay. I think the band as a whole is clean as ever and it is effing awesome. Take it from me, it is an album worth owning and giving a few listens to, if you are a Limp Bizkit fan. Oh yeah, and the poster, The Jonas Brothers #1 fan, you can suck a fat mofos under pants hot dog. Learn about music and then start posting again you f word poser...

So, anyhow, I love the colors, and the format, as well as the calendar and everything. Easy to use, can't really go wrong.  BUT  I have been looking for a way to log in my workouts, not a fancy smancy work out app, just a way to put in what I'm doing, and then modify as I'm working out without having to stop my work out for 20 minutes. The task lists are PERFECT for that!  I put together my own workouts, so I don't need lists, and complicated tracking devices, and whatever else, I want to make an easy to read and navigate list.   Now if I could makes groups within a list, or color code the tasks, it would be supreme!  I'm loving this thing!

1451627289|4.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King's work as long as I can remember. Over the last few years, I've read his latest work and have found it wanting. This book makes up for Cell and others like it.   Nobody sets a scene quite like Mr. King, and the immediate familiarity a long-time reader gets within the first few pages is a comforting delight. The main character George/Jake seems to me as though he was drawn as a sketch, never fully fleshed out. I suspect this was done on purpose. We never really know George, or grow to care for him completely - like we do Sadie. George's personality comes and goes. Fitting, I think, for a time traveller.   The story aims towards the historic events of the late 60's, but it's important to note that it's not really about that at all. It is ultimately about sacrifice and love, about friendship and empathy. It's a beautifully written story, with my only complaint being the rather clunky pointing out of every 'coincidence'. It's not necessary, we pick it up all by ourselves.  I really enjoyed this book, well done Mr. King.
0810993139|2.0|I understand that some parents have a hard time getting their kids to read so anything that gets their kids to pick up a book is welcomed but I think this author has taken the easy route and has created a book that young kids like because it portrays kids doing what they are not supposed to do and showing these situations as humorous.  After reading this book, my son, who has an amazing memory for what he has read, likes to try out the vocabulary on me.  For example, when adults are talking saying \\"Yak, Yak, Yak and rolling eyes like they do in the book.\\"  He is a good kid and I let him know I won't tolerate backtalk, etc but why encourage it by buying books like this?  The book talks about sneaking out and telling they parents they are going to do one thing and really doing something else that the parents have forbidden, etc.  The list goes on and on.  I wonder if the parents buying this book ever read it with their kids.  There are some great fiction stories for kids in the 2nd through 4th grades - my son is in 3rd.  The top of my list are Where The Mountain Meets The Moon, Boxcar Children, Roald Dahl books (these are so far fetched that my son has an easier time separating the inappropriate things the characters do from what is done by kids in real life) and the Jules Verne books that are slightly abridged for this age group.
1451627289|5.0|Like some of my fellow reviewers here, I have been reading Stephen King's novels, short stories and novellas for the past 30 years. He is my favorite author and he is, in many ways, the voice of his generation. 11/22/63 is definitely the best novel since at least Bag of Bones, and maybe even since The Dead Zone. How many of us long to change the past, to right past wrongs and avert past tragedies? This book is about that longing and ultimately also about living with the consequences of the events of the past. The plot is top notch, like the best of Stephen King's novels, and the book is populated with believable and well balanced characters. I tore through the whole book in a few days and really loved it. I highly recommend the book for King's fans and also those unfamiliar with his work since the book stands brilliantly on its own.

The Fire needs to be updated to include a Calendar Function.  Something this basic is a MAJOR miss for Amazon.

B0041KKYGU|5.0|The tag line on the movie posters stated \\"She doesn't give an 'F'.\\"  Let me be the one to tell you that SHE REALLY DIDN'T!  Cameron Diaz make this very dark comedy about a gold-digging teacher looking for her sugar daddy, just to wind up back in the same school that she quit, work.  It's a dark, vulgar and hilarious comedy that probably have made some teachers who saw it, relate to it on some level.  If you don't take it seriously, it pretty funny and me and my brother laughed all the way thru.  It had the same premise as BAD SANTA as far as the main character goes....you know, the illusions of what could have been vs. the reality of what they're living thru now.  That's the major factor of what drove this comedy forward.  LOVED IT!!!
B0061JPYX2|3.0|It is so sad whenever someone whom is both talented and especially tortured ends their life too soon. Amy Winehouse is honestly one of those definite lost souls. She has so much heartbreak she had to deal with during her last days of life from drug abuse, to problems with the law, and sadly being heckled and booed during a planned return to the stage earlier this year. Sadly, in my personal opinion, when the fans turned their back on her, she really drowned herself in her sorrows. I don't think she had ever gotten over it, and lost her life to alcoholism. But how has she been remembered as a singer? Well, just mainly as a one-album wonder with Back To Black. But, what about the rest of the music she had leftover before she died, well it isn't a strong gathering of what she had left behind. Honestly, it showed just how much troubled she was just like the music here.<br /><br />Lioness: Hidden Treasures is a compilation of the songs Amy Winehouse had recorded from her leftover songs. Some could've appeared on both Frank and Back To Black, others could've been made for her supposed to be third album. The songs at times seem a bit short of expectations (especially the covers.) It doesn't fall in deep on the ballads or the dance tracks like what Michael Jackson had with his last songs before he died into 2010's Michael, but is a curious reflection of what she had made of her voice. The collection of covers is mixed. While her cover of Body & Soul with Tony Bennett is the stand-out, other covers feel more drowned and weak like A Song For You (which was better from Whitney Houston when she did it a couple of years ago,) and Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? The ballads aren't really as strong as they could've been. While the original songs Like Smoke with Nas and Our Day Will Come aren't bad but could've been better. Still it is a good bet for die hard fans of the troubled soul, but should've been more.<br /><br />While it is very tragic that Amy Winehouse died too soon, Lioness: Hidden Treasures isn't a definitive buy for those new to her voice because of her death. It is a fairly good buy for die hard fans, but not a great record. It just shows how messed up and troubled she was as a singer, and left behind a deep voice that was soulful. She could've brought more to help her songs stand out, and help her beat the pain. But overall we really don't know. Amy had the talent, but didn't know how to get herself composed from the pain. May the lioness rest in peace, but her song play on.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+res isn't a definitive buy for those new to her voice because of her death.

The characters are great, the story is positive-With respect to the other review I read about being confused if the book wasn't read, I do not agree-enjoyable either way, and great for all the things I like in a movie-good story, the \\"good guys\\" win (Abilene, Minnie and Skeeter), the folks who aren't so good get theirs, too-fairly faithful to the book, something I also don't see often in adaptations to film-
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|Megadeth continues to grow with time.  This thirteenth album is full of great stuff.  While it's been touted as heavily politically charged, that's really only true for three or maybe four songs.  The rest are along the lines of the newer Megadeth themes about life, death, etc.<br /><br />While I wouldn't say that this one is better than their previous album, End Game, it is at least equal to it and a lot more introspective.  Like all recent albums, Thirteen has a new, edgier feel with deeper subject matter without losing the band's true thrash/speed roots.<br /><br />Great stuff.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these headphones for exercising and kicking around.  Given the price, what did I expect?  Pros:  Price  If they break it doesn't matter  they are light  Remind me of the Sony sports headphones in my Walkman from 1994 but they don't sound as good.  Cons:  The lightweight chord has so little weight it tickles your chin and face because it does not fall straight down.  They sound like garbage.  They have no bass, crashy treble, and make everything sound crunchy.  the chord is too short for running.  I have to pull my shorts up really high so i don't have to run like Igor (I'm only 6 ft tall, ok).  Chord should be like 10 inches longer.  the point where the chords leave the headphones is strange, it's like 2 inches up from the bottom of the ear buds. Why?  If you are poor, short, or don't really care about sound quality your mileage may vary.  Otherwise get some Koss PortaPros, live with the sweat, and be done with it.

140053271X|4.0|This is my first e-book reader. It has lots of good points that others have already discussed. Therefore I'm only going to comment on the one thing I actually dislike about it thus far. There is no back light. If the screen was white, it wouldn't be such a problem. It's not though. The screen is light grey, so reading in a bright light isn't all that helpful. Most printed books pages are some shade of white, and I thought the Nook screen would be white as well. I got the reader for my 88 year old mother and was looking forward to being able to adjust the contrast to help her see the page more clearly. I should have done more research.

B00005UO5Z|2.0|For those who are unaware, pay close attention to videos which come from other countries.  The item description should include a Region number.  That number must match the number on the back of your video player or you will be unable to veiw the video.  I recently purchase a video from Rarewaves in London, England.  While the seller identified it as Region 2 and had a note to see DVD format, I think they should have used more \\"attention\\" focusing words in their listing.  Not knowing about the Region thing left me with a video that I cannot watch and would cost me more to return, than I paid for it.
B0064J6OMO|2.0|I remember watching the trailer for this and thinking what an interesting premise--a male version of Freaky Friday. This should be funny!   Since I hadn't heard anything about it in the theaters, I figured it couldn't be that great.   So I wanted to kill some time on a lazy Sunday afternoon; so, I remembered this movie and decided to watch it. As soon as the opening scene where the baby pooped into Jason Bateman's mouth flickered onscreen, I knew that I should have turned it off and considered my 99 cents lost.   I found myself wanting to punch Ryan Reynolds character in the face several times, even when Jason Bateman plays him. He's written as so selfish and douchey that he's unlikeable.   There is also too much nudity for the sake of nudity. There's not enough funny to go along with it. It's just crass for no purpose.  Also, you'll only think the parts with the kids are funny if you hate kids. That's a broad assumption, but I think its pretty true. Think an infant pounding his head against the side of a crib is funny? Think a douche leaving kids on a high counter to be nearly eletrocuted and stabbed is funny? Then watch this garbage.   I'm sure that there can be an entire book on horrible filmmaking that can be written based on this movie. However, I'm no expert on film. I can't tell you aout problems in plot and dialogue with expert analysis. I'm just a viewer that says that this movie sucks!

B004KAB2ZS|5.0|Six months ago, I gave one of these to my 4 yo son and it's been on his nightstand ever since! He still looks at it several times a week. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- Amazing design on how the animation works; pretty easy to be mesmerized by it.<br /><br />- Even though it's not a board book, it's still sturdy enough to allow my 1 yo to play with it.<br /><br />- Perfect stocking stuffer or companion gift. I bought many of these and like to include it with any Star Wars gift I give. I swear the parents love it more than the kids do.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- Due to the \\"magic\\" that has to occur, there really aren't that many pages and very little text.<br /><br />- Slightly darker than other Scanimation books I have so you'll need more room light.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />- Love it! Here's a test for you: put this on your coffee table and see how many people pick this up. Lots of entertainment value.

B004H83IG4|4.0|Gosling and Dunst both turn in outstanding performances in this film.  I had vaguely heard of the story it was based upon, and was glad this film got me to look into it again.  What a captivating, scary and polarizing person.  An interesting story that is well paced with the timelines that it has to cover.  The ability to show just how much a person's life can change, whether in an instant or over the course of several years, is always subject matter for an intriguing story.  The special features interviews are also well worth watching.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|So after a full review of thids product I write my review:  Turtle Beach normally makes quality headsets for PC, Xbox 360, and PS3. Before purchasing these, I did my homework, and reviewed alot of top headsets for the gaming market. I limited myself down to three. The choice between the Turtle Beach x41's, The Tritton AX Pro's, and the Astro a40's with Mixamp.  The X41's are simply marvelous. I chose these because at this point, I dont have the kind of cash I would like, and wanted to get a fairly inexpensive headset, that does everything I want it to do.  When I was looking at headsets, I wanted the following:  Either Simulated, or real Dolby Surround Sound. Didnt matter if it was 5.1 or 7.1. I just did not want to deal with simulated stereo sound anymore.  Wireless. This is big for me because I have a little brother who is careless when it comes to anything gaming wise. Hes the cause of my last headset malfunctioning. Before I bought these I had the MW# Foxtrot Simulated Stereo Headset. They broke within a month, due to my brothers handling of the cables.   When reviewing the x41's, initially I was skeptical because of some of the things other users were saying. People with these experiences were experiencing a popping sound, due to too much interference of wireless devices in the houses (such as wifi modem/router combos, wireless phones). In the area where my video game is, I have a couple of wireless telephones, and 2 wireless modems, because I run a business off of one. The room in which my xbox is, is fairly small, so I was thinking this might be a problem.  Also, I experienced reviews where users said that one ear, was significantly louder than the other. In which cases they had to get a new headset, and or use the warranty so get a new one from Turtle Beach. ill be speaking about both of these issues further down.  When i first received my x41's. Hookup was easily. Attach the optical cable from the base to the optical out on your xbox. Place the batteries inthe headset, which is very easy. pair the headset to the base, and voila. **Note, if you do not have an Elite model Xbox, you will have to purchase an additional AV cable which has both the Red, and white output, as well as the optical output on it. Turtle beach fails to mention it. They prolly assume that this late in the Xbox 360's life, that everyone has one. which is probably not the case.  After I got everything hooked up, I gamed for about an hr, and then it happened. The pop noise. Only once, but I can definetely see why people complained. Its an loud obnoxious sound, the sound fades out for maybe 1-2 seconds, and then it comes back. So i did a little bit of work. I re-arraigned both my modem/routers farther away from the base, and moved my telephones to different areas (which I had been meaning to do anyways) and since then I have had no problems. It has not made that popping sound again.  **Note. The interference that comes from the wireless devices doesn't seem to mess with the headset actually. It seems that when the base of the headset is close to your modem/router, or any other wireless device. Most likely, the wideband signal that your modem gives off, just doesn't leave too much room for the Base of the headset to get a good signal, so when the signal is gone completely, you'll hear that popping sound. I'm no genious when it comes to these things, but that's it seems like is happening IMO.  ***Ive set right next to my modem/router in a different room with the headset on, and It never makes that popping sound.  I noticed right off the bat that the Dolby Sound processing was excellent. I can hear sounds in games that before I never could hear/pay attention too. I can clearly tell where enemies are coming from while playing gears, and the direction is perfect. If someone in game is talking from my left. His/her voice will sound muffled in the right ear. If an enemy is walking behind me in Gears of War 3, I can clearly hear his footsteps, going from softer to louder and he gets closer, and get the jump on him. I did not experience the left ear being louder than right ear issue. Maybe those headsets were just defective models. Or something came loose during shipping.  They are relatively light headsets. The ear probably weighs the most of the headsets. They're big enough to accumulate your whole ear, and are made from a mesh material, so they let your ears breathe during gameplay. During one session I logged about 5 or 6 hours, and my ears weren't hot at all. Although, they were a bit fatigued, and hurt just a bit. Not much, and I figured that with more use, after the headset gets used to my head shape, that it wont hurt like that anymore. But well see, as I get further with this review.  The battery life is as expected for a wireless device. I got about 8-10 hours on the pre-packaged batteries, and about 15-18 hours with my Eneloops. If you know you're going to log long sessions with this, you are DEFINITELY going to want to invest in some re-chargable batteries. The headset uses alot of juice, and can kill less brand model alkaline batteries in 5 hours tops.  Like I said I've only had this for a week. But so far, I haven't had any problems with this device. Maybe in the future as the tech gets older, and starts to degrade, ill have some problems. But things like that, are too be expected. As I use this device for my Xbox, ill continue to monitor and update this review, as I have problems.   All in all, if your looking for a headset, with great sound. And fairly affordable, id say go with the Turtle Beach x41's. They look great, and setup is easy as pie. 5 Stars.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|this is a wonderful app for all ages. can't wait for my grandkids to play it. works great on acer 500 tablet. thanks amazon.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Us Yes fans can be pretty fussy about out music and our favorite band. I am one of those Jon Anderson nuts that thinks it can't be good without him. \\"How can they just throw the guy out his band.\\"  From the first minute of the album they had me, \\"damn this isn't so bad.\\" By \\"Sad Night at the Airfield,\\" I was sold. \\"This is pretty good, this guy doesn't sing so bad.\\"  The Title track was written mostly by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs (The Buggles) and the 6 different sections of the title track fit together nicely. You can tell that they were written at different times, but I like they way they did it. This is a 5 star epic, excellent vocals by the way. Not Jon good but good.  The next 5 songs aren't quite up to the quality of the title track epic, but none of them are real bad:  \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\": This is a Chris Squire tune that he sings. I always thought he had a good voice and he sounds good here. The song is just OK, however.    \\"Life on a Film Set\\": Another from Horn and Downs, it was written for a Buggles album. It was originally called riding a tiger. Benoit sounds good on it, he sounds a little like Trevor Horn. Guess he is used to imitating other singers. This is a good song with some great parts. Steve shines on it, both on acoustic and electric.   \\"Hour of Need\\": Written by Steve Howe. Benoit sounds more like Anderson on this than he does on the others. This is a pretty decent song, but not great.   \\"Solitaire\\": Steve Howe solo acoustic, enough said.  \\"Into the Storm\\": Written by the band, and it would have fit well on Drama. Great bass line and Alan White can still play and proves it here. Again, I think Benoit sounds like Trevor Horn on this one. This one rocks, and shows they still got it.   Summary: I have played it over 20 times and it sounds good each time, \\"Into the Storm\\" rocks and it's the song that I miss Jon on the most. Would love to hear him sing it. This is a good album and not just for Yes fans. Asia and Buggles fans willalso enjoy it. A good 4 star album and that's unusual in 2011.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I don't ever submit reviews, and this app is so sweet I had to do a review for it! I am going to search for this application for my tablet when I get home!
B00009Z576|3.0|I had just written a review for \\"Fly From Here\\" and it made me want to play \\"Drama\\" and check it out. I saw this band in Buffalo, NY and it was a real good show, but Jon was missed. Horn just couldn't hit the high notes, he sang these songs OK but was horrible on the classic Yes. The music is hard to describe, its Yes but it also has that commercial sound of The Buggles.   I really like \\"Machine Messiah\\" and feel it was written before the Buggles joined, though the album credits all songs as being written by the band. Dream Theater must have been influenced by this one. \\"Does it Really Happen\\" has a great bass line and Alan White shows why he is one of the best drummers in rock and roll. The foundation for the 90125 sound was set here. This is a Squire song with those trademark Buggles vocals.   \\"Into the Lens\\" opens side 2 of the original LP, and musically it is a very good song. The \\"I am a Camera\\" vocals can get real old. I remember singing it all the way home, good thing I was driving or they would have thrown me out of the car. Squire is king of rock and roll bass players and proves it here.    \\"Run Through The Light\\" follows with some Steve Howe guitar work, this song can be anoyoyyoyyoyying. Steve and Alan make it worth listening too, but the vocals are beyonyonyond lalalalalaamee.   \\"Tempus Fugit\\": Is one of my favorite Yes tunes and is a great finish to an album. Yes Yes.  Squire is King.  Summary: I give it three stars because some of the vocals are just not very good. There is no doubt that the best vehicle for Buggles music is Yes. Squire, Howe and White add something to the Buggles music that improves it greatly. Not as good as \\"Fly From Here\\" but if you like that one: Get this one you won't be sorry.
B005F96UNM|5.0|In a style I have not seen before, it is very colorful.  It is practically like watching a comic book unfurl before your eyes, as some parts did exactly that.  I highly recommend this movie.
0321356683|5.0|i loved the book,,   1) it like reading math,, it make u sharp and think outside the box,  2)it make you avoid human error and make you more organized, the name of the book is really descriptive , this teach you to write more effective jave , one have less mistakes and have better feature,   3)i like how it try to show the advantage and disadvantage for each idea he have  --     however, it not a book that give you new job! but it make you better than others. it wont make you have something that is worth a promotion.. it a book that is not mandatory  but still very important !  i advice every java programmer to have it.
0439023521|5.0|Hunger Games is probably one of my favorite books...ever. Yes, I sound like a teenager, but I don't care. Hunger Games is \\"my Twilight\\" (or at least that's how I explain it to my 13 year old niece.) I was told to read it maybe more than a year ago but didn't pick it up until this summer, when I first got my Kindle. It was my first book on there, followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay, which I excitedly bought when I realized that with a Kindle I could do that now! I ate these books up, but not as much as the first one.<br /><br />I think what originally hooked me is how like Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" the beginning is, and growing up I adored the horrific nature of that short story. Naturally I enjoyed the horrific nature of this novel. Children fighting to the death against each other for entertainment? It's like if someone decided to make a tv show of \\"Baby Roman Gladiators\\" or something! And again, though I'd be horrified, I'd totally watch it.<br /><br />When I first read Horror-- I mean Hunger Games, I loved about a million quotes but didn't know how to highlight on the Kindle yet, so I have no idea what they were now. Reading it a second time, I highlighted this interesting paragraph--<br /><br />\\"Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there's nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you.\\"<br /><br />Katniss says this as if the Capitol were saying this to the districts, taunting them. I LOVE this, because of the sheer horror of it. I've used the word horror a lot in this post, I know. But this truly paints a picture of our villains, and they are not to be trifled with.<br /><br />I love the imagery of the book, the entire plot line, the improbability of it all...basically, if Hunger Games was a cake, I'd eat it.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Best app for children this is a fun app.  coloring is best, add on pictures of animals, airplanes,cars.  Everyone should have.  the children will busy with this app.

1591840562|4.0|This book is filled with some interesting, thought-provoking information.  Most importantly, Guy really encourages any potential business owner to just get started.  Once you get your business off the ground you can fine tune all the details later.  Of course, planning is important, but it can reach a point where it becomes counter-productive.  I mean, would you rather have a business or a business plan?  I definitely enjoyed the book.  I wouldn't say the information is necessarily earth-shattering.  There's no guarantee that if you read the book you will be a successful entrepreneur, but I believe anyone interested in starting a business will be better off for reading this book.

0321704452|4.0|How many times have you been sitting in a presentation with an enormous amount of Powerpoint slides, each completely filled with text so small that you can't read it?  I've sat through several, and each time I knew that there was no way it was the proper way to present.  This book outlines a much better way to go about presenting information to any audience.  I definitely learned a lot.  I highly encourage anyone who has to give presentations to read this book and give some of the methods a try.  Hopefully we can spice up those boring corporate presentations.
0545265355|3.0|I bought The Hunger Games trilogy box set because I've been hearing about the series for a long time now and REALLY wanted to read it. I decided I couldn't wait for the third book to come out in paperback and, since I like my series to be alike hardback/paperback-wise, purchased this set.  It surprised me by arriving very quickly but, as I took the books out of the decorative cardboard box to see the covers I received another, less thrilling, surprise. The third book in the series had several pages that were bent and smashed into each other. I have nothing against general wear and tear from used book purchases or from books I've bought and read so often - things happen. BUT this is a brand new item, and I expect the product to be in perfect condition.  After looking closely at the decorative box that holds the 3 books, I saw that the cardboard back was folded and tucked in on the side where the third book rested. When the book was placed in the box, the tucked in edge went INSIDE of the book rather than TO THE SIDE of the book. I do realize this means the bent pages are not Amazon's fault but rather a design flaw in the packaging and carelessness by the packager/packaging system, but I just warn everyone looking at this item that this is the possible condition in which your book(s) will arrive.  P.S. - The pages were bent back almost in place by manually straightening them and then keeping pressure on the correctly closed book for a few days. I am keeping the set, and have already enjoyed reading it in its entirety.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app on my Windows Phone, iPhone, and my Fire and it is great everywhere. Quick and efficient.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Works just great. I own a jail-broken Ipod Touch 4G and have the Display Out app so it worked fine when connected to my Samsung 1080p HD TV. Was able to view videos from YouTube, IstreamNet, MX Tube, and aTube on the wide screen as well as read e-mail and surf the specials on Amazon.com. Being able to charge the device simultaneously is a big plus as the battery drains quickly while displaying video to the TV.  I took one star away as the cord is rather short so I had to order a dock extender so I don't have to hold the actual adapter while holding the Touch at the same time.  It would have gotten 5 stars if the cord was at least 3 to 4 feet long.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a action packed, romantic book with surprises creeping around every corner. The internal and the external conflict combined with the events and characters made this book a action packed thriller and THE BOOK OF A LIFETIME!!! the sentence structure is goes great with the dialogue and vocabulary.

B00507ZQVQ|2.0|I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8\\" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6\\" apart. The room has sound treatments. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.   My collection includes the 1989 Aida from the Met with Domingo and Millo as well as a 2004 open air performance from St. Margarethen, Austria with Suemegi and Andreev.  I thought it was time to replace them with the new Met performance.  This is essentially the same performance as in 1989, same stage setup, costumes and props.  Picture is, of course, a lot better, no complaints here.  Sound is another story.  Soundstage of the DTS 5.1 MA track is not much wider than stereo, just the applause comes also from the sides and not only the front. Orchestra and chorus are o.k., just not very wide.  The voices suffer from variability of the loudness, depending in which direction the principals are singing. At the beginning, it is rather static, everybody faces the front and variability is limited. But as the action picks up, it gets worse. Amonasro (Guelfi) moves his head all the time and he sounds the worst. But it affects pretty much everybody.   The stage microphones are in 4 pairs at the front of the stage, aiming pretty low, I guess to catch the sound when the action is in the back of the stage and the chorus. But for the principals, no good. A dozen names given for the audio, Mix Ken Hahn (from Merry Widow and La Traviata fame).  For comparison, I inserted the 1989 DVD (4:3) of the Met and pretty much the same sound, (stereo only). Soundstage just as wide as the BR, orchestra and chorus o.k., voices just as variable. Looks like even the same microphones are used in the same positions. In over 20 years no change. Somebody must have kept detailed records in 1989 and they still follow them today.  Then I loaded the 2004 St. Margarethen DVD. Screen is 16:9, the singers carry body mics.  Picture is, of course, not as good, particularly in the wide stage shots. The closer shots are ok.   Sound is DTS 5.1 and gives quite a wide soundstage, at least 2 feet past the corner speaker.  Orchestra is a bit thin, but the voices are solid as a rock and the singing is quite o.k. The acting here is the best of these 3 performances, with Cornelia Helfricht being by far the best Amneris.  So I don't consider this Aida a good replacement and cannot recommend it. It's time for the Met to get some body microphones.

B0056C6XIA|5.0|I bought the Bear Grylls Survival Knife [[ASIN:B003R0LSMO Gerber 31-000751 Bear Grylls Survival Series Ultimate Knife, Serrated Edge]] last year and it is great. So when I saw this Survival Kit at Dicks Sporting Goods I had to have one.  The thing I like best about Bear Grylls from Gerber is the handles are very \\"rubbery\\" (if that's a word) so when I use it my hand does not slip. Even when I use the multitool or knife in the rain. The little flash light with this kit is very bright and handy in a tight spot. Keep the Bear Grylls stuff coming Gerber!!

1907590102|5.0|I read this book when I was 14, after seeing the movie.  It is a wonderful story and it made a huge impact on my life.  I recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in spiritual transformation and Paris in the 1920s. I wanted to give a copy as a gift to a friend but this version, which is the only version available right now in new form, is so ugly that I will not buy it (my personal taste, perhaps some will love it).

B005RYF5JA|4.0|Well, Celtic Woman just keeps hitting home runs.  My favorite DVD is \\"Songs from the Heart\\", but with that said, I have enjoyed their whole body of work and this is, as the others were, a first class performance by the girls and crew.  Lisa Lambe is a very fulfilling member replacement.  I do question some of the song selections and is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but that is subjective.  Everything said and done, I think most who have enjoyed the prior CW performances, will enjoy this one as well, I know my wife and I did. The DVD has 1 or 2 added numbers that the PBS show didn't have.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.<br /><br />However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: \\"Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt.\\" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was \\"off\\" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.<br /><br />Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as \\"Snape.\\" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.<br /><br />An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many \\"surprises\\" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.<br /><br />Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.<br /><br />Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.ing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|This movie is mildly confusing in the beginning jumping from past to present....once you get through about fifteen minutes it pulls you in. The acting is Good. The story is Thought Provoking. The movie felt a little like Heaven Can Wait only with younger actors....and no deaths...just a movie about destiny and fate. I don't think of this movie as one I'd watch \\"over and over\\". You'll not find yourself mining any gems from the script. However its compelling enough to excite one's curiosity and make you think about \\"fate.\\" Emily Blunt is a very talented lady and intriguing. Matt makes a convincing young politician.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|I loved this movie as the Smurfs themselves are true to their personalities... Papa and crew wind up in New York after a magical portal opens.. Papa and the gang must try to get home when there is a blue moon.. The story is good and the effects are incredible... Gargamel got on my nerves a bit... He comes across as stupid.. Even goes as far as to use the bathroom in a resteraunt bucket... Other then that... This film should be a hit for young and old alike...<br /><br />The extras could have been done with a better voice over, especially on the behind the scenes stuff on how the Smufs were created, and how smurf village came to life... The 5 stars is for my love of the smurfs and hope that there is a second movie with these little guys...
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is a complete singer and composer. You don't see at these times people who can sing like her. She sings all her best songs and some covers. The songs Turning Tables, Set Fire to the Rain, Rumour has It, Chasing Pavements and of course Someone Like You are beautiful performed. The covers are also great. In my opinion the covers If It Hadn't Been for Love and I Can't Make You Love Me are the best, specially I Can't Make You Love Me, her interpretation will make Bonnie Raitt proud.  About the sound, is amazing. You can feel her performance all the way.   Now the part that is not so good. I was hoping that since this is 2011 they shot this concert in high definition, IS NOT. Of course is Blu Ray, you see better definition than DVD but please!!! I hate the dark bars!!!!  Well I gave 5 stars because even when they did not shot this in HD I still like the concert, how she interacts with the fans and the sound.
0446563048|5.0|I've never bought anything from Zappos before but after reading this book, I'm very impressed with Tony and his business savvy. I've always been amazed with the individuals who can really succeed in numerous businesses but Tony's track record is amazing considering his age and experience at the time. So many great ideas for leadership and I really appreciated his outlook on life. One thing that I would like to know (if there really is an answer) is if you are a born leader or can learn it. In this case, clearly Tony was born to do this. He was taught traditionally and appears his family raised him NOT to be this kind of success, but something deep inside of Tony drove him to this calling. I loved his thoughts on 1% improvement everyday.. That was my main goal taking away from this book.

B000068FWC|5.0|This is without a doubt one of my favorite albums on the 70s. To me it is still very fresh and doesn't actually sound like something that came out in 1979. If you love AOR and want something that you can listen to from start to finish then this is a great album.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|Yet another failed attempt by Hollywood to use beautiful animation and graphics (which the movie does have)in an attempt to overcompensate for a lackluster performance in every other area. Also, it leaves out a few important aspects from the book.<br /><br />This movie is a shell of the Sim or Scott version. I doubt I will watch it even a handful of times through the coming years.<br /><br />If all you care about is animation, this is probably the film for you and your family. If you appreciate cinema for character development, acting, and realism, this is not the movie for you.

B006ANJ4BW|2.0|While I enjoyed most of the acting the final script was scattered and stereotypical and the direction was so lackluster that one comes away from this film just not caring about the characters or their challenges and without really feeling like the world of REH's Hyborian Age was brought to life.  This should have at least been a fun action film (I never really expected a good REH adaptation) but instead it ended up boring me to where I was waiting for it to be over.  If I wasn't interested in being fully informed as to the merits of the film, and the lack thereof, I would have turned it off and done something else for the last 30 minutes.

1451627289|5.0|I loved it and couldn't wait to sit down to read 50 or more pages at a single sitting. I've read many of King's novels and shorter works, but this shows how far his writing and storytelling has come since \\"Carrie\\" debuted in 1974. I think it ranks as one of his best. Some may gripe about King's so-called \\"padding\\" to make his books lengthy epics. but they not only embellish the plot, but serve as welcome detours that embellish his engaging story as the Constant Reader turns pages to the climax. As Jeff Greenfield wrote in the Washington Post about King in discussing this novel, \\"...his work suggests that if a time traveler found a portal to the 22nd century and looked for the authors of today still being read tomorrow, Stephen King would be one of them.\\" King can no longer simply be pigeonholed as an author of horror and supernatural tales. With his latest work, Stephen has enhanced his reputation as an author with clear-cut literary credentials that infuses his more recent works with infused with humanity, passion and emotion.

B001HN69B8|5.0|This movie really opens your mind. Amazing movie, I would suggest everyone get the blu-ray :) Has the best actors and is a true adventure to watch.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|The movie started out decently, but started losing me at the lobotomy. Having seen Brazil, I knew what was coming when she yelled \\"stop\\", and I think it would be obvious to most viewers as things progress. I was always too aware I was just watching a movie, and often wondering why things were happening. I really liked The Watchmen, it's likely my favorite comic adaptation, so I had high hopes for SP. But... SP seemed so derivative, like a mash-up of Brazil, Moulin Rouge, and Lord of the Rings with modern Kung Fu. I found the CG a bit cartoony in the fantasy scenes, as though it was done 10 years ago. The acting was good, but the story just seemed a bit trite for me, though the extended version ending I saw was good, with the deeper interaction from Jon Hamm. I will be watching for what this guy makes next.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|I loved The L Word series, although it obviously started going downhill in season four and continued a downward slide through season five.  But season six is just horrible.  Characters act totally unlike they have in the previous five seasons, and the whole mystery about who killed Jenny (if anyone did) was so boring.  Who cares who killed Jenny?  The character has been completely unlikeable for years; honestly, I'm surprised that she wasn't done in long before this.    And for being the last season, there is no closure.  The last show in the season is especially weak.  And the whole big mystery around Jenny's death is never solved, either, in case anyone actually cares.  What a horrible way to end a good show; The L Word, and its fans, deserved better than what was delivered.

1423424514|5.0|This is the \\"pocket-size\\" version of the official Hal-Leonard real book Vol. 1. Which is to say: every tune and chart is exactly as what's on the \\"big\\" version (10.9 x 8.8 x 1.1 inches). This unfortunately also means that the notable omissions from real book vol. 1 - as compared to the legendary original bootleg version - are missing in this pocket version too (for me, \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\" and \\"Spain\\" are 2 of the worst omissions - how can you NOT have these 2??).   This book, though, remains invaluable. It's incredibly portable due to it's size, and I've played numerous concert/wedding/corporate/pub gigs this year relying solely on it. The size is reduced compared to its original big brother version, but it's still clearly readable in any dim stage/pub light conditions - even charts with long bebop lines such as \\"Confirmation\\" or \\"Donna Lee\\". If you're a student going through music college (like I was until this winter), you'll love the fact that you can shove this into your backpack everyday without worrying about it taking up space.   All in all, a must-have for any gigging musician.
0307595579|5.0|These books are just fascinating.  I don't think any of them took me more than a week to read.  I have a Kindle so I carried it around with me everywhere.  I'd sure love to have this woman's brains and fighting skills!

B005DD7H50|4.0|Bradley Cooper is Eddie, a writer trying to write but cannot write a word. He is a straggler who is bankrolled by his girlfriend Abbie Cornish. However, she gives up on him as well and he bumps in to his ex- brother -in-law, who gives him a pill that harnesses the intelligence of the brain in such a way that the ordinary man becomes exceptionally gifted and is able to perform at many many times his normal aptitude. So you know what can happen from this point, Eddie becomes famous and bad guys start stalking him. Eddie also realizes that too much of the pill can turn him in to a monster. Bradley Cooper finally manages to carry this film on his shoulder, Robert De Niro has a small role but is okay as usual. Great film to watch on a day when you have nothing to do and simply relax. 4 stars. 11/26/2011

B004LWZW4C|4.0|Of all the superhero films, I simply love the Xmen series the most. I enjoyed the first film immensely but the second film was just plain for me.  I have yet to see the Wolverine film, may be I still might. This particular film is set against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis as Charles Xavier ( James Mcavoy) is recruited by Mona Mactaggert to assemble a team of mutants to prevent World War 3. Casting is perfect and includes Kevin Bacon as the villain.<br />The film works because all the characters are extremely unique and besides their unique skills, bring a drama and emotion to the film. X-men is first class and distinct, it not only revitalizes the genre but provides entertainment through superb background music, strong script, and direction. 4 stars. 10/25/2011
1439102813|4.0|Alice is a bright and well-respected professor at Harvard.  She travels and is frequently asked to speak at conferences.  She advises students and the most difficult part of her life is the fact that one of her daughters has decided to bypass college in order to try to be an actress out in California.  Then Alice is in the middle of a speech one day when she can't remember the word she needs to use.  Hours later it comes to her, but the experience leaves her feeling unsettled.  Soon she is having many similar unsettling experiences.  The diagnosis is shattering--early onset Alzheimer's.  Alice's life changes dramatically, as do the lives of her family members.  Everyone must now deal with the fact that Alice, a strong and competent woman, is fading away and becoming less and less able to cope with her life by the day.  This knowledge affects each member of the family differently, as they struggle to figure out how best to help Alice while also protecting their own emotions.  This book is a devastating story of a disease that takes away every aspect of a woman's personality and identity.  It was hard to read about her thoughts, especially as she grew more forgetful and people began to turn away from her.  It is terrifying to think of Alzheimer's and the damage it is capable of doing to an individual.  I thought this book did an excellent job of getting inside Alice's head and conveying the confusion and fear of someone whose reality is slipping away.  I would have liked to have seen more of Alice's husband and his thoughts on what was happening, though.  It seemed he simply shut down, and I would have liked to have had a clearer idea of his motivations.

B005V4FJC4|2.0|The retro-style artwork and the fluffy lightness of She & Him would seem to be perfect for an album of Xmas tunes. Unfortunately, the results are hugely disappointing.<br /><br />The first couple of songs sound pretty good, but things go downhill as the album progresses. \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" should have a bit of swing, for example--but She & Him's version has none. Everything is tidy and as on the beat as it is possible to get short of employing an army of sequencers. \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" is rushed, and there's not even a hint of chemistry between the two--which is particularly bad, given that Zooey is an actress. And the 1950s/1960s-style reverb gets very tiring after a while.<br /><br />This is one of those Xmas albums that will make for *excellent* Xmas party background music, and that's about all.
0545265355|5.0|OK, so I am going to write this in my sentimental paradigm. Any of you who share a love for books know that feeling when you finish a book - a rare, incredible book - that leaves you entirely hollow. Sort of like you've invested your entire spirit into this story and your life's purpose has been fulfilled. It's bittersweet.  The Hunger Games has been a lifeline for me in the last few days because I've been really, really ill! Haha a great distraction! And wired up on so many side-effects that I have barely slept. But the story has kept me going and it is a real whammy.  Finishing the third and final book, Mockingjay, was a feeling akin to finishing the Harry Potter series. Not quite on the same magnitude, but it was definitely on the scale.  Suzanne Collins writes a very chilling and realistic tale about the question of what it means to be human when pushed to do inhuman things, to become a base animal in the face of survival and then return from that. The world she has created is scary because it's a direct reflection of both the best and worst parts of the world we all live in - practicalities asi...de - and that's what makes it so valuable. Katniss Everdeen is not a character I loved. Her animalistic sides are hard to empathise with - though sympathise you will. But at the end it's her humanity and her vulnerability that win out and the horror of her tale. Hermione Granger - she I love, feel a kindred spirit in. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire, is a character forged in flames that draw my respect and awe like a moth. Collins is a genius for this. She has created entirely another species of believeable female protagonists that men don't have to cringe or scoff at. Katniss and Hermione are the antitheses to Bella Swan simply because they are neither the victims to the age-old 'Damsel in Distress' literary tool, nor are they the fore-runners to some kind of pro-feminist agenda that removes their gender (thereby their ability to be truly reached by their audience) entirely. Neither Katniss nor Hermione need to remove power from their male counterparts in order to bring power, strength and integrity to their selves - they are beacons for believing in themselves, feeling fear yet making courage win out, trusting in their purpose, and sticking to their guns (wands, or bows).  A lot of different emotions permeate the text and catch you off-guard. Desperate loneliness and cold fury. Tragedy, of course. I've found actual fear in some passages which is a rare occurrence for me - how can you actually fear something so removed from your own reality as a written, FICTIONAL text? But believe me, you can fear for the characters whose cause becomes your own in some way or another. There were times when I found myself clutching my Kindle, holding my breath, heart almost paused at certain statements; eyes frantically leading me on to where I hoped a resolution was waiting. There is the thrill when Katniss gets the upperhand and the horror when another is brutally killed. Even a little bit of levity when clever dialogue or character interaction adds much needed humour to the narrative. And of course, always the hunger - not simply for food, but for mercy, and for justice - that casts a very harsh stage-lighting on just how good we do have it and how important it is that we don't sit in these laurels and waste the good we've got, right?  So yeah. Pretty much. If you are lucky enough to have learned to read - which means you just did - you should read this series. Please. I'm about 99% sure you won't regret it... and we ARE the 99%, after all.

1451648537|2.0|I read the book quickly and it was an easy read, but was left disappointed.  What a missed opportunity.  The book lacks detail and insight into his upbringing, keynote prep, design process and many other areas.  Ultimately, it felt like it was just an extended newspaper article.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King at his best!  I've read nearly everything he's written and for those who may shy away thinking King is only a \\"horror\\" novel writer, you don't know what you're missing.  Many of his novels, including this one, are not horror but truly a psychological journey into a world he has created with the imagination of a genius.  I will read this one again and again.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Got this today and I am impressed. It is light, a nice plastic tray that holds it very well (I hate the corner straps on other types) and a nice rubberized front plate that folds for nice upright viewing or completely folds back under it with no bulge. Strap keeping it shut is strong for protection in a briefcase/bag. I wholeheartedly recc this case.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|It's unfortunate that the arrangements on some of these songs really ruin them.  Our Day Will Come could do without the cheesy background singers.  Between The Cheats is no better.  Like Smoke starts off great, but NAS actually does no good for the song. He's too forceful and makes the song unbalanced.  Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow, Half Time, and Valerie are the only really good songs on the album.    Overall, a disappointment.

B006FE17Q6|5.0|I saw episode 1 last year on HULU one night. I did not have the opportunity to watch any further episodes. HULU was a tease and did not supply any further. Well my situation has changed and now have access to cable, again, whahoo. Just saw the recent episode, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already\\". Now I find I must purchase the intervening episodes. I will not sleep well til I fill in the blanks. So I think it's pretty good.

B004HGBUQ6|4.0|Lucinda Williams returns to the style that she was known for in her earlier work.  Songs are a bit dark and serious.  The lp has very good dynamics but is pressed on clear vinyl.  Seems to be quite noisy for a new album that was properly cleaned.  The cds also furnished are good quality.  It is interesting to hear the \\"raw\\" kitchen cd and, then, the polished work.  I like this album much more than \\"Little Honey\\".  The recently married Lucinda was just too happy on that one.

0792839749|5.0|A must-see under-rated children's film.  Great songs by the Sherman Brothers of \\"Mary Poppins\\" fame.  A great movie although it is too long. 140+ minutes!  (Opening titles/prologue alone are over 10 min. long) Due to the film's length, children may have to view it in 2 parts. (Not a problem with DVD.)   Dick Van Dyke is in rare form.  In my opinion, even better than his performance in Mary Poppins. Lionel Jeffries is hilarious and Gert Frobe (Auric Goldfinger from 007) is surprisingly funny. The special effects on the car are quite clever.  The flying scenes look a bit fake, but in 1968, digital and motion-capture weren't yet invented!   (My Amazon-purchased copy is full-frame. Look for the 2-disc widescreen version.)   Leonard Maltin doesn't like \\"Chitty,\\" but I disagree with him.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|my son is going to really enjoy this one.  love the textures and stickers! and since its free right now thats even better!
B00027JYLC|5.0|This movie is not only a must-see it's a must-have for horror fans.  I love watching this every halloween season.  There are more recent movies that have copied this plot.  Some of them nearly exactly.  They'll never make another to rival it though.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|I was really disappointed with this. There were a few scenes that had some 3D \\"WOW\\" factor, but the narration, editing, narrative were all amateurishly put together. I hate to insult the filmmakers, but it just didn't hold together well. It had these horribly done animations, and the narration skips between Redford and another guy, it's very weird.  And, while I expected with Redford narrating it would probably be 'environmentally preachy,' I must say it really was over the top (and I'm a Sierra Club member!) -- still, I guess can't complain about that. But be warned: it's preachy. :)  And boring, did I mention boring?   This subject matter demands better filmmaking.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|What fun !  Has an amazing array of stickers and multi-patterned crayons in addition to a very complete set of \\"normal\\" pencils and brushes  Very intuitive, encourages creativity....wish my tablet was larger !!  Got mine free as part of Amazon's kindle fire promo...will actually keep this one on my machine
B005HP2JAM|1.0|This was OK, but quite forgettable. I think at this early stage of 3D content, the pickins are quite slim, so anything shot in 3D is being marketed. If this were not in 3D it would have no audience whatsoever.  One note: A lot of this footage is 'fake' 3D, it was done artificially after it was shot, and the flaws show themselves quite often. I expected more from Herzog. People with a 3D system looking for some 3D \\"WOW\\" will be really disappointed with it.   If you are an adventure and archeology geek, I'm sure you'll like this, tho be warned: the 3D does not 'add' or 'bring out' the content the way I expected it to. Also, as a narrative to a general audience, one gets the sense there is some notion that Herzog is driving toward, but at the end there is no 'there' there.  I gave it one star to bring down the rating a bit, as it seems artificially inflated for what it is.

0307959856|4.0|In 1803, Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet remain happily married after six years at Pemberley.  They have two young sons (Fitzwilliam and Charles); her only unmarried sister Georgiana resides with them though her marital prospects look promising.  The couple hosts their annual gala with his family, her father and another Bennet sibling Jane with her husband attending as well as other guests.  Only the youngest sister Lydia, married to that rogue Wickham, is unwelcome and uninvited as she remains estranged from the extended Bennet family who want nothing to do with her rascal husband.<br /><br />As the host family and their guests settle for the night, Lydia arrives at Pemberley hysterically screaming that someone shot and killed Wickham in the woods on the Bennet estate.  Almost everyone at Pemberley think the same thought that Wickham in death is the same despicable person he was in life as each feels an affinity to the unknown shooter.  Still because it occurred on the Bennet estate even if the victim was trespassing, Darcy, Elizabeth and others consider their options to diminish the scandal including investigating the deserved murder of wicked Wickham though none feel prepared to do so.<br /><br />This is an interesting sequel to the Jane Austen classic as mystery great P.D. James puts her spin on what has happened since Pride and Prejudice ended.  The story line focuses on two themes that never quite fully merges; Sheridan's A School For Scandal manners theme with a murder mystery inside the Austen Regency world.  Still this is a fun entertaining Regency whodunit in which Janeites will enjoy Ms. James' where are they now as she captures the original essences of the cast with a six year maturation.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I used to be a great fan of \\"alternate reality\\" books, starting with Kingsley Amis' The Alteration. But that was when my own life was not nearly as good as it is now, and lately, my tastes have shifted to non-fiction-- trying to find out more about the world as it is and what made it that way. As for Stephen King, I stopped reading him after Cujo (I had a St. Bernard for 11 years...).  Nonetheless, reviews of 11/22/63 intrigued me, and I ordered it. It was amazingly well done! I finished it on a 9.5-hour flight from New York to Tel Aviv; I've just landed and realized that I did not sleep on the plane. It's that good.  Still, there are thorns. Whoever transliterated the Russian words used by one of King's characters erred badly; I think the town of Killeen in Texas has two l's, not one; and there are several other typos which made me wince. But all in all, it's a breathtaking, can't-put-down read... and I may go on reading Stephen King again. We'll see.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The movie was fine but the digital part was a waste got it just for the movie but the movie it's self was very good a little dark both in lighting and the plot
B000TGJ80I|4.0|This title has 5.1 PCM apart from Dolby Digital 5.1.<br />But I didnt find much difference between PCM and Dolby. Picture quality is good. It has single disc, unrated version.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Ordered this after I got my Kindle fire.  As other have stated it is a tight fit but I like it that way. There is very little chance it will fall out while I am carrying it back and forth to work or while I travel.  As for the cover not laying flat, I found folding the cover back and forth seem to fit this.

B005URRCUY|3.0|I have been anticipating this album for the past year and after finally listening to it, I am not as impressed as I thought I would be. Every song on this album is up-tempo and short, except for the first couple of minutes of Little Black Submarines. Comparing this album to their previous 2 albums (Attack & Release / Brothers), absent are the Hammond organ/ Keyboard textures, slow bluesy passages, the melodic emotional vocal melodies, and the grit.. When I first received their previous 2 albums, I listened to each of them every day for about 3-4 months without getting tired and was heavily influenced by them. El Camino, at just over 37 minutes, I was able to listen to this entire album while I went out for a run, from start to finish. After a few more listens, I do not have much of a desire to listen to it again. They went from Blues/R&B/Southern Rock, to 80s Glam rock. It seems that Dan had been listening to some 80s David Bowie before he came up with some of the songs like \\"Sister\\". I think that fans of their earlier work will appreciate this album more due to the overall simplistic nature of the album. In a nutshell, this album is 11 short up-tempo songs that all kind of sound the same and are not very inspiring. 37 minutes into it, the album is over.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I never really watch DVD's of my favorite artists but I am sooo glad I bought this!

So if you have an Adele fan in your life, get them this, I promise you won't be sorry!!

B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|I'm too young to have seen the original, but Hawaii Five-O is one hot remake. Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan are great as the odd couple: the Hawaiian seal and the former NJ cop have great chemistry and their interactions are often laugh-out-loud funny. And Grace Park kicks ass. On the gorgeous Hawaii, this special task force sets to solve cases that are interesting and unpredictable, and the result is one great ride.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|Felt the 3 stories were more like chapters in one of his longer books.  Good reading material but way too short and not worth the money.

B004G8QHKO|5.0|\\"Passive Me, Aggressive You\\" by The Naked and Famous contains a clever blend of indie rock and electronic music.  The vocals in each of the songs convey intense and organic emotion. My favorite song on this collection is \\"The Sun.\\" \\"Passive Me, Aggressive You\\" is best for anyone that is curious to hear unique songs of the indie rock, alternative rock, and or electronica music genres.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|So far so good, this app totally covers my office needs when it comes to my phone., which is to say, not that much. But it's been there when I've needed it or when someone absolutely couldn't wait and needed something done right away.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|\\"Platinum Collection\\" by Enigma contains a strong  organization of soul nourishing songs.  What I also like about this compilation is that there are for forty tracks contained on three cds that provide musical healing and joy.  My two favorite tracks in the \\"Platinum Collection\\" are \\"Beyond The Invisible \\" and  \\"Gravity of Love\\".  The following are some of the other soothing and exciting songs  in \\"Platinum Collection\\":<br /><br />1) TNT For The Brain (Midnight Man Remix)<br />2) Return to Innocence (Long and Alive Version)<br />3) Push The Limits (Radio Edit)<br />4)  Seven Lives (Radio Edit)<br />5) Turn Around (Radio Edit)<br />6) Boum Boum (Enigma Radio Edit)<br />7) Out From The Deep (Radio Edit)<br />8) Following The Sun (Radio Edit)<br />9) TNT For The Brain (112 Bpm Radio Edit)<br />10) Push The Limits (133 Bpm ATB Remix)<br />The \\"Platinum Collection\\" by Enigma is good for the many who enjoy listening to any music from the new age and/or chillout music genres.

B005SV9X22|5.0|\\"The Monster Ball Tour\\" by Lady Gaga is an entertaining dvd that features many of her greatest songs.  This collection shows Lady Gaga musically pouring her heart out in the songs with compelling artistic effect.  My two favorite songs in this dvd are \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" and \\"Born This Way\\".  In \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" she is wearing what appears to be an angel-themed costume.  Please understand that I intend to live a long and happy life. However, this concert performance of \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" resonated with me because the implied meaning appears to be about always finding ways to always look for happiness and have fun. \\"Born This Way\\" is her last performance on this dvd that sends a message of believing in one's own beauty.  I am glad that she chose \\"Born This Way\\" as the last track for her dvd concert performance.  This is because I definitely needed to be reminded of  the underlying message from \\"Born This Way.\\"  I also like the bonus features included. For example, she is seen meeting  one  of her mentors backstage (Liza Minnelli).  The meeting proves to sentimental and uplifting as Liza Minnelli encourages Lady Gaga to continue going after her dreams.  In the bonus features, Lady Gaga is also seen embracing and appreciating two among many of her biggest fans.  \\"The Monster Ball Tour\\" dvd is great for anyone that has enjoyed any of her concerts and/or musical tracks.

B005VR9328|5.0|The Roots tenure in the music business spans much of hip hop history from the late 80s, through the 'golden age' of hip hop, to its current state of affairs. Each of their albums has a different tone, and this is by far the darkest and most poetic. A 'concept album,' undun tells the story of a poor kid who thinks he's making the right decisions, but gets drawn deeper into the drug game until he's killed. Yet the story is told in reverse, kind of like Pulp Fiction.<br /><br />As a Roots fan since Do You Want More, this album inspires me.  Their musicianship is perhaps better than it has ever been. Quest and Co. are experimenting with lush classical tones amid the boom-bap-blip, especially on the album's closing suite of four instrumental songs. The MCing is inspired.  Black Thought is ill, and more precise than ever. Great guest spots from the likes of Greg Porn, as usual, and haunting hooks and verses by Dice Raw.<br /><br />As much as it inspires me, it also depresses me. That's the point. The Roots are making real art here, a work with a poignant message that can be interpreted on many different levels.  For me, they are telling a dark story that contains a message about life's value and how humans cannot survive faced with only bad and worse choices.<br /><br />The stand out track for me is Sleep, which marks death. The music is so weird and hard hitting. Almost like something from Portishead circa the mid-90s. The lyrics and the imagery of falling leaves create a mood of bittersweet release.<br /><br />I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes hip hop but yearns for something beyond the sophomoric slogans that dominate the genre these days. It might be dispiriting thematically, but simple pop doesn't wake people up.
B004HO6I2O|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. I love Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds. Yes it is the same old same old switching bodies movie. But it was a really funny comedy. If you like to laugh and can take a little crude humor, then this movie is for you.

B000002L9J|5.0|When I first heard this blaring from a pick up truck of a friend, I had no idea what it was but was drawn to it. I told him... \\"I like this 'happy music' - I don't know what to call it. Who is it?\\" He said 'The Smiths'. I immediately went out to get it and wore the sucker out. This was the beginning of alternative and Indie. Music that wasn't made to be three minutes long for the radio. Music that was fresh and unlike any other. It still is. Morrisey's voice is loving, hating, wistful, and romantic - all at the same time. The music is fast.   The Smith's greatest hit collections are aweful comparatively because there is no consistency. In this album and in their first \\"The Smiths\\", the music is simply wonderful.  Many critics review this album and The Smiths' self-titled first album (The Smiths) as being two of the best albums of all time. They are.

0439023513|3.0|I will start off by saying that the first 2 books in the trilogy were amazing and riveting. Absolutely couldn't put them down.  The 3rd book I couldn't put down because I kept thinking with every turn of the page, it had to get better right?  Well, it didn't...don't get me wrong...it was well written and suspensful and definitely enjoyable; however, the ending was a huge misfire for me.  What acutally happened?  SPOILER ALERT:  I don't understand...I felt like Suzanne just got tired of writing and ended the book.  I felt like there was no story line of where Katniss's mother went...she just didn't care enough to say goodbye?  And what about Gale?  He loved her so much he just didn't go back to district 12 to fight for her?  And although I'm happy where and who Katniss ended up with, there was no love there to read about.  I thought the author just quit writing what we all wanted to hear about...a tale of a tragic life that had a somewhat happy ending full of love and devotion.  The only feeling I got when I finished reading was that Peeta and Katniss ended up together because the author made Gale seem to lazy to come fight for her.  Maybe I'm thinking about it way to much, but I definitely was so saddened by the lack of any emotional connection to the ending.  After following the team of main characters through the first couple of books and really loving where it was going, it was a disappointing end.  It wasn't the way it ended but the lack of narrative that would have helped me get to that place.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|What a nice watch. Quality is excellent. Although I am not left-handed but it looks nice on my right wrist. The black cloth strap with leather backing is really nice. The clock may look big but it's actually lighter than other smaller watches I have. The price also was irresistible ($99) retail price was tagged as $599
0439023521|5.0|Absolutely riveting!  I loved every single turn of the page.  I thought the whole idea was horrific...but in a way that kept my attention and was 100% thought provoking.  She did an amazing job with character developement and I felt like I could find a way to understand why they acted and reacted the way they did.  Absolutely wonderful.  Finished the book in 2 days...and I have a 2 year old so I don't have ANY spare time.
030788743X|5.0|the book is a surprisingly easy read - and credit has to go to Cline for figuring out a tone for the protagonist / first person narrator Wade that is very comfortable and easy to process. Sure, he and his fellow \\"gunters\\" all happen to be near-experts on 80's culture including the various video games, the unforgettable movies and even the unique brand of music created by that generation. But Cline makes sure that even those born after those golden years get a quick 411 on what makes each video game, movie poster or Happy Meal toy unique and distinct from the rest of the products of that decade. The informational bits are certainly helpful, although at times they do feel a bit dragging when you're already familiar with what's being discussed.<br /><br />Given the book is written around a game, a lot of why the book works is because of the craft that went into designing the various puzzles and how all the pieces connect together. I'd like to think that Cline did a pretty good job here as well, although I must acknowledge how someone who is not familiar with the kind of obsessive gaming culture that continues to thrive among kids and those adult \\"kids at heart\\" out there, some of the novelty may be lost. I'm not saying that you need to be a geek to enjoy this book. But it would certainly help you if you are or at the very least that you have some degree of appreciation  for geek culture.<br /><br />The book promises many things including the mystery and adventure associated with the game, the sense of danger presented by the evil corporation trying to gain control of James Halliday's resources for themselves and a romantic interest for Wade to boot. But given how much of the success of the book is based around the game within the story, it's clear that's where most of the writing efforts went. This is not to say the romance wasn't sweet or without its poignant moments. But one does have to admit that it could have been better fleshed out and the \\"villains\\" of the book could have been less one-dimensional.one-dimensional.
0439023491|5.0|I thought this book was even better than the first.  The story line thickens as the Capitol gets more and more dispicable.  I thought I would be able to figure out what happens between Peeta, Katniss and Gale; however, it has so many twists and turns.  I couldn't put it down and loved the final chapter.  So many characters are brought back into the mix it's absolutely fantastic.  Looking forward to the final book!

I can't really say how the episodes are but if it's anything like the first season, expect lots of violence, sex, and nudity. They don't seem to hold much back on this show. I am looking forward to watching it!

B004DLPXAO|4.0|I use it constantly and am not annoyed in general.  I like the text resizing and background color control.  Overall I wish it were more elegant though, with the option to turn on page turn effects like other readers have.<br /><br />My main complaint is with how limited the store is.  It can be very hard to get information on an author or which book a series starts with (if it's not right in the title).  Seems like there should be more clickable, link-able information for each book.  Why can't I just click the author's name, or the series name from the carousel instead of looking at the cover, then going to the store and searching the author?  What's the point of having all this connectivity if it's not any smarter than a regular brick and mortar store?<br /><br />Overall good quality app, but as I said, limited.

B005QPGHQU|1.0|Every song on this able sounds like a complete mess.  None of them come together for me in any positive way.  Amy Lee's voice is still impressive, but the lyrics and tempo are just awful.  The electro-funk-goth sound they seem to be trying for is poorly executed and just doesn't work for them at all.  I was a big fan of Fallen, and thought that Open Door had some alright tracks, but there is just nothing redeeming about this album.  A few of the songs I even started to get into, until the refrain got thrown in.  You'll be listening to a track, and suddenly the entire vibe of the song will change, and in a very negative way.  The effect is like listening to a well-tuned symphony, and then having someone break a glass bottle right behind your head: jarring and unpleasant.  Bottomline:  This group has lost its identity and sound.  That's probably why this album's sales have only been around half of what Fallen and Open Door sold.

B005V1WZ10|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Korn and though I have mixed feelings about particular albums for the most part I enjoy everything they've released to date. This is a band that has never been afraid to experiment with their sound and never have truly had a signature sound as each album has a feel all it's own. Whether it be the sheer rawness of their 1994 debut or the spacey dramatics on [[ASIN:B000031XCP Issues]], each release has significant differences that allow it to stand on it's own.<br /><br />The Path of Totality is by far their most drastic experimentation to date. Featuring a wide array of various Dubstep, Drum and Bass, and Electro House artists. We have heard Korn utilize more electronica in their music ([[ASIN:B000031XCP Issues]], [[ASIN:B000066HQC Untouchables]]) and the finished product was of excellent quality. (in my opinion) we see the same on The Path of Totality. I feel it was a brave step in an interesting direction and that the mixture of electronic elements breaths new life into a band that has, for the last few albums been straying away from experimenting with their sound.<br /><br />The DVD included in the Special Edition is worth the extra cash. It includes the entire Korn Live: The Encounter that was broadcasted on HDNet in 2010. This live concert was in support of [[ASIN:B003GE69JS Korn III - Remember Who You Are]] and features mostly tracks from that album, however their are some excellent older tracks scattered here and there especially towards the end. The DVD also includes interviews with the entire band regarding The Encounter performance and also their opinions on The Path of Totality. The Special Edition also includes two bonus tracks \\"Fuels the Comedy\\" and \\"Tension\\" both being excellent additions to the album.<br /><br />I personally feel this is one of Korn's best releases in years. I love the new sound and am enjoying the contrast of Korn's signature low gritty heaviness to the high energy electronica. One has to wonder if this is a sign that we can expect more experimentation in the future or was this simply a step away from the norm and we see a return to the gritty hard rock group they have been on their last couple releases? Only the future will tell, but by what I have heard on The Path of Totality I truly hope this is a trend that Korn runs with on future albums.

B005B0QYMM|4.0|I always enjoy looking at horror trailers on Youtube, and the Grave Encounters always appeared in the recommended list, so I finally watched it. It was interesting, so I bought this film used at my local Hastings. The beginning is very cheesy because they over do it with the parody of ghost reality shows. And even bribing ppl to lie about the supernatural? LOL! It's a major cheese fest...until the doors are locked. Then, the movie takes a 180 degree turn and becomes truly scary. I thought the CGI was pretty good, especially the \\"tongueless\\" monster. That thing creeped me out! The thing in the bathtub was also very scary. I give this fright flick 4 instead of 5 stars because I could not stand the dialogue. Every other word was the F word. F this and F that. It got annoying and killed some of the tension. The acting was very good though, and the atmosphere was oh so terrifying. If you like low budget \\"mockumentary\\" horror, then give this a watch. It's worth it, and lives up to the hype given by the infamous trailer. There is one scene that seems to be inspired by Roman Polanski's \\"Repulsion\\" that is both scary and hilarious at the same time, that is worthy of mention.<br />The special features are okay...an interview with the directors and producer, along with a short making of featurette. The directors are the average, cliche emo/goth sensationalists who seem to milk to culture for all its worth. They are obviously very talented filmmakers though, so their appearance has no real significance to the movie. Their screenwriting could use less profanity, though. I'll be checking out more from this dynamic duo in the future!
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Wow this movie was really great! The acting was by far just perfect, the story, the main character, just everything was so good.
1451648537|5.0|Take a bite out of the Apple!  ...It is a fast pace, never boring flight on Steve Job's magic carpet ride throughout Silicon Valley!<br /><br />Walter Isaacson, formerly with CNN, Time and an Obama appointee to run Radio Free Europe was an able writer up to task to report the news, happenings and aftermaths of important events.  Steve Jobs' life contained all of the above. Walter devoted over two years into a worthy biography that contained all of the positive elements that a successful entrepreneur must have including all of the warts that go along with that growth and maturity too. Steve's only instruction:  Isaacson is to write his book and Jobs is not to see it until its published.<br /><br />I worked, as an outside vendor, with Apple's Q.C. Dept back in 1980-2000 and occasionally saw Steve when he was walking down the halls, but never talked to him. His reputation was well known then: a whining cry-baby who got his way, mostly for better.<br /><br />After reading this book, Steve was certainly depicted as he actually lived life. However, don't pick this book up ready to learn everything about Steve Job's personal or business life concerning all his reasons, pros or cons for business decisions in Apple and Pixar or motives into interactions with others.<br /><br />His Zen type of interaction with his inner spirit helped him to understand himself and gave him personal comfort. Steve Jobs still had difficulty in telling others his feelings and so he never really did when alive which caused angst and misunderstandings that he himself never really explained in the book either for his own reasons. So, some say this was the book's flaw; maybe so, or was it a plus since he channeled his energy into motivating others.  Lastly, whether or not or what Steve Job's did for, with or about his personal wealth accumulation is nobody else's business. I find it totally ridiculous how many people are now judging Steve Job's decisions - bottom line, it's his money, so get a life!<br /><br />It made me chuckle in the last chapter as Steve, being a control freak to the very end, got the final word.  After all, it was his life and Steve didn't want loose ends with others writing after he was gone with conjectures of what he meant to say or thought. Isaacson made the decision to insert Steve's final thoughts to clarify points as his own autobiography, unconventionally, into his biography. It was as if Steve was to end life with him having the last word, like placing a \\"but\\" at the end of Isaacson's biography. It worked as a real zinger to Steve's life story - \\"I did it my way!\\"<br /><br />As a side note, I got an Apple iPhone 4S just before starting to read the book.  After reading about Steve's input on every small detail to develop a product,  I see his not so tiny fingerprints all over this product's features physically and in its software design too. It is as if he has achieved a cult-like afterlife inside the iPhone! LOL!chapter as Steve, being a control freak to the very end, got the final word.

But thank god - more like the author- Walker and Lara's story was wonderful. Not some childish story but a real love story with complex characters. They should have gotten their own story. Funny thing some earlier stories were about boring characters and yet the most interesting characters do not get their story!!! Please make another book with only these two characters and without Sienna and Hawke.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The controller I ordered for my boyfriend was great. This would be a great gift for anyone who loves gamecube games like super smash bros and play competitively. But you really have to make sure you order a new controller that is fulfilled by Amazon. Otherwise, you risk receiving a horribly used and defective controller. Since these are no longer being produced in the US, you should really shell out the fifty dollars to have a good controller from Japan. The only complaint I have is that the L and R buttons probably have a really cheap spring inside because you can feel the spring vibrate as you release. Since this was made in Japan, I'm not too surprised. We plan to simply take it apart and replace the springs with springs from another controller that doesn't have this problem. The process is fairly simple with the right size screwdriver.   Overall, I highly recommend this product when bought from Amazon.

Its seamless UI and intuitive interface makes for an awesome doodle app for the Kindle Fire.<br />I'm not artist by any stretch of the imagination but I find myself using the Drawing Pad app more for stirring up my creative juices.<br /><br />Pros: It's simple and easy to use with a lot of options.<br /><br />Cons: Little or no customization of pens, paint brushes, & etc.<br /><br />Wish list: I would like to see more customization of the pens, paint brushes, as well as more stamps (Draft, Final, Denied, etc).<br /><br />In conclusion, this app is a great for anyone young and old. I highly recommend the app for your Kindle Fire which seems to really shine on the 7 inch screen.
0385339585|4.0|The story is very good with a few exceptions. There is far too much on the litigation. Actually, I scanned through a lot of the family litigation portion which cuts the reading into a manageable heart of the story. The other criticism I have is about the end of the story. It was very unsatisfying to say the least and it left a big gap in the reader's mind as to whether Mr. Grisham ran out of ideas for the end of the story and decided to cut it short by... sorry about the SPOILER...killing the \\"golden goose.\\" I would have explored an alternate end which would lead to a sequel with another 800 pages. The alternate end would also make a better movie script. All in all the book is worth reading for the wealth of information and description of an ecological part of Brazil that should be made into a beautiful national park, the \\"Pantanal.\\"
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is a band that evolves in style every couple of albums, which has created  a spectrum of fans. Some prefer the alterna-rock and \\"Creep\\" as their anthem, and others prefer the more cerebral experimentation that the band has grown into. For me, OK Computer is the pivotal point. Aside from \\"Fitter Happier,\\" which I skip, this is one of my top 10 albums; that is a rare thing to say now that we are so used to single tracks. I still get chills listening to \\"Let Down,\\" one of the overlooked tracks on the album. Were I to introduce someone to \\"my\\" Radiohead, it would be with this album followed by [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail to the Thief]].

0743233832|5.0|Review of  \\"Marcus Aurelius,  The Emperor's Handbook\\", A translation of the meditations, by C. Scot Hicks and David V. Hicks,  Scribner, New York, Copyright 2002, ISBN 0-7432-3383-2  This is a marvelous translation of the meditations of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which is based originally on the writings in Greek, by the Emperor himself, while he was out fighting against the invasion from the North by the Germans.  The mediations have been translated and re-translated through a variety of languages, not all of which are known.  We are very fortunate that the new edition by the Hicks brothers, has made the language very easy for the modern American to enjoy.  Marcus Aurelius lived in a period of time in which philosophy was considered to be the pathway to find truth, and the influence of the Atomists was strong. Christianity was considered a bizarre and dangerous cult that was to be punished. The Hicks brothers have produced a translation that is very enjoyable, and thought provoking.  Many of the points of view of Marcus focus on self reliance, being good to your neighbors, maintaining equanimity, and the inevitability of death. He could be credited today with the recognition of the Carbon Cycle, in which all our atoms are recycled to allow new birth and life. These Meditations by the Emperor have value today in helping people to organize their thoughts and their own life.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke knows how to market an e-book and his track record of best sellers will absolutely back up that claim.  In this book, he shares with us the methods that he used to bring the readers to his books.  Some of them are common sense though sometimes it is easy to overlook the obvious and John makes us refocus on the common sense ideas before taking us into his marketing plan.  I am not going to spoil his book but will say that there are good tips in there and parts of his plan are very good.  If you are an author making pitiful sales and you have a good product, John's tips will focus you where you should be to make better sales.  Will you make a million sales? Probably not, but you could perhaps, with work, make enough sales to support your writing.  The only downside to this book was that it did feel like John was marketing his books to us throughout the delivery of his system.  Some people may see this as a bad thing or feel that it detracts from the usefulness of the book.  I however, felt it truly highlighted John as a master of the marketing craft and if anything, it showed that the information his system provided has a good bearing on how to succeed as an independent author.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|You can't take this movie too seriously, especially if you take P&P seriously. Having said that this movie does not trash or disrespect P&P in any way. The central theme of the movie is preserving something that has already been errecably changed, and imagining hiden depths to all the characters, which doesn;t at all slight JA in her own characterisation, but makes the watcher realize that everyone that Miss Austen created can be looked at a little differntly.  The basic premis has been discussed, and having seen clips focusing on the potential of a romance between Amanda the heroine and Darcy, I was of course skeptical that I would like this movie. First the only way that a romance could work is if the romance that we all love, Elizabeth and Darcy is destroyed, second I don't really want to spend three hours getting involved with a love story just to see it fall apart, so it's no win, they get together and you've just ruined one couple, they stay apart and you've just waisted your time. I spend most of the begining of the movie worrying about this, until I realized that without the romance the movie was fun and thoughtful. I got to see the train of events we all know get derailed, and watch Amanda try to put them together.  I won't give the ending away, but I will say it was satisfying. This movie is really something that all P&P fans can appreciate, I doubt if non P&P fans will find as much funny about this movie, nor will they appreciate the charcter shifts. My favorite scene in the movie is when the Benetts are rescued by non other than George Wickham, and the dashing charming Captian is set down right away by Amanda who isn;t going to have any of his charm. In fact the Wickham storyline is many ways the highlight.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Great movie for adults and teenagers. Sometimes sequels are not as good as the original but this was for sure! Some of the scenes are pretty unbelievable, but this was expected with this type of movie.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|People should try actually watching this blu-ray collection.  While I understand the concerns of the fanboys, this was the best release of the \\"new\\" episodes, and after watching them in crisp blu-ray, I cannot imagine going back to my VHS set to watch the original three episodes compared to the cleaned up blu-ray copies I now own.
0142001104|4.0|On finishing the book and reflecting on the passages that I'd marked, I would have to admit that the musical anecdotes were less \\"insight-filled\\" to me as a reader. I felt a stronger connection with Roz's passages. Perhaps I wasn't open enough to those passages that spoke of musical selections with which I am unfamiliar. I did learn in reading it how little I know of an orchestra student's passions. As an academic teacher whose orchestral students were sometimes missing from class for extra music practices, I briefly felt an annoyance with Ben's admitted assumption that he had no realization of his student's other commitments. We as adults pull students in so many directions... we often forget that their own passions may differ with the expected compliance with mandated curriculum.

B005V1WZ10|4.0|After returning to basics on album number nine \\"Korn III-Remember Who You Are\\" Korn have gone all experimental again with album number ten \\"The Path Of Totality\\"(originally it was only going to be an ep) which is released a mere 17 months after their back to basics approach. Which came about after the hit and miss albums \\"See You On The Other Side\\" and \\"Untitled\\" which saw collaborations with The Matrix and Atticus Ross. \\"The Path Of Totality\\" see a whole host of collaborators mainly from the world of dubstep, the most famous being Skrillex. This reviewer is glad to say that the new approach work well for Korn and this comes from someone who loves their classic early sound.   On album opener \\"Chaos Lives In Everything\\" we are welcomed by a looped drum machine before Jonathan Davis vocals kicks in, it's got to be said Davis vocals sounds really good over these big beats with Munkys guitar also in the mix. It does seem Fieldy's famous slap/click bass sound is missing not only on this track but most of the album really. This track comes of sounding like Pendulm only much heavier. \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" which has already been released again features Skrillex and features a crushing barrage of beats, it's one of the standout tracks on the album along with the \\"Get Up\\" again featuring Skrillrex whose beats nicely compliment Munkys guitar and features a heavy driven chorus.  \\"Let's Go\\" which features dutch drum and bass outfit Noisia is one of the catchiest tracks on the album with a great chorus. \\"Burn The Obedient\\" starts off tame enough that's before the chorus kicks in. \\"On Way Too Far\\" which at times is really mellow before Davis delivers a death metal vocal. \\"My Wall\\" again features some real big beats with Davis changing his vocal style throughout. Not everything works of course \\"Sanctuary\\" is really underwhelming and at times Davis sounds like a knock off Marilyn Manson. Album closer \\"Bleeding Out\\" is fairly lifeless.  With the special edition you get two bonus tracks \\"Fuel The Comedy\\" and \\"Tension\\" as well as a full DVD of the performance from last year of \\"Korn The Encounter\\"(It was shown on TV last year) which is filmed in a crop circle with no fans present, it's a nice addition and bonus for fans who won't like the experimental album but will like to hear Korn classics. The only thing with the DVD is that there is a load of studio overdubs used on the live tracks.   So with album number ten Korn have gone as experimental like never before, the dubstep style works well on the album even if it at times it get's a bit repetitive. YES this will split their fan base, it deserves more than one listen before you write it off as there's some real good stuff on here and the band should be praised for trying something new so long in to their long carear.

B0009HKH6Q|5.0|I worked on this film. I naturally wanted to see it again and remember where I was during every scene. For those who haven't seen it...what are you waiting for? Steve McQueen was a great person to know, full of fun and a zest for life not often seen. The cinematography by my friend Haskell Wexler is.....well what would you expect from a two time Oscar winner. And, of course, Amazon had it at the right price. it showed up in what seemed like minutes.
1600242405|4.0|Brilliant, funny, provocative and honest.  Some thoughts:  Richards' devotion to music is plain in every early Stones' performance I've seen (see YouTube);   I never knew that acoustic guitars recorded on a cassette deck were further amplified, distorted, re-recorded, and layered on \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" or  how his electric guitar with the 5-string, open-G tuning formerly used by country bluesmen was an absolute key to the late '60's early '70's sound;   \\"Brown Sugar\\" was recorded in two takes, Keith delivering his harmony vocal directly into Mick's microphone;  Keith is a fierce and loyal friend which explains why he loves Mick Jagger like a brother but does not consider him a friend; and  \\"Exile on Main Street\\" was made piecemeal by tax exiles in Keith's rented house in southern France but it didn't matter, it's still a masterpiece.  Stunning ability & dedication but world-class dissipation, too--drugs, misogyny, etc. For 10 years, Richards was voted Rock Musician Most Likely to Die! He pulls no punches about himself and offers few regrets, This becomes difficult to accept later in the book as one tallies up the casualties; Gram Parsons, John Belushi and many walking wounded, not to mention the countless victims of the over-the-top, rock 'n' roll lifestyle influenced by (but unknown to) Richards.  Didn't expect to like audiobook narrator Joe Hurley better than Johnny Depp but I did. Wry, English-sounding (he's Irish-born but from London), and pitch-perfect.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|If you're a fan of this second great quintet that Miles Davis had, then by buy this disc.  But if you're the type who likes so-called \\"cool jazz\\" or the music of Kenny G, Kirk Whalum and other \\"smooth jazz\\" artists then this challenging music isn't for you.  One reviewer ignorantly ranted that there's no variation in the tunes on this disc must be unaware that the performance of \\"Agitation\\" varies in mood and tempo from the Paris to the Belgium concert.  The sound is mono but it's so well recorded that any true devotee of Miles will not mind--this disc is a monster!!

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Not sure who the folks are using this program and giving it 5, 4, 3, or even 2 stars!  Company reps maybe?  Maybe the system makes a big difference.  I can't get this program to do anything on my ASUS Transformer!  Whenever I try to open a document from my installed word processing program, it just crashes.  My main goal was to get something with spell check.  I can't see how ASUS created a program without it in the first place.  As for this one, I wish I could have my $10 back!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Perhaps there was a compatibility issue that some update corrected, but this program seems to work just fine now. However, aside from opening other MS programs, I am not sure of the benefit of this program versus another. Whenever opening a document I tend to absentmindedly choose one-- and the free ones work just as well as this one I bought. But in all honesty, it isn't a 1-start any longer. Probably worth the NOW $0.99 (three stars for having paid $10)
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This show is AMAZING. Canceled after only 14 episodes there were huge outcries for someone to pickup the show for many years, so much so that they made a movie called Serenity (which you need to watch). Years after its cancellation references are still being made to it by other popular TV shows because of its pure awesomeness. The only thing thing is that you'll probably kill yourself after the 14th episode because Firefly will leave a void in your soul that no other show can fill, so there is that...

B005QPGHQU|5.0|The latest album by Evanescence combines passionate and dreamy lyrics with intense guitar playing, and that glimpse of darkness which is their signature mark.

B0050NJMKG|3.0|Having been to school in Belgium in the 50s and donated 1 fr of my 5 fr pocket money to the Congo missions each week this book left me with some shattered mental pictures.  However to put all the blame on Leopold credits the man with skills and abilities which make him a super human monster. The question not answered or even addressed in the book was who were the Marius' and his Anthonies to this particular Caesar?  The other more general question that begs an answer is why we persist with a social structure that rewards greed and selfishness which ultimately results in the type of situation that occurred in the Congo and so may other places in the past the present and no doubt will in the future .Surely we can find a better system of human governance...  Back to the book, it made it's point though the kindle presentation lacked pictures and documents, it sometimes dwelled to long on a specific situation, so that the impact intended to make the point was lost... none the less as an inspirational tool and in my opinion it should be read by all western students before they take their gap year..

1617930350|3.0|The hotel was old and run-down when he first saw it, but it had a great Manhattan address and Swiss-born and hotel trained, Hugues Martin, immediately saw its possibilities. So after borrowing and scraping together every cent he could find he bought it and transformed it into the Hotel Vendome, a luxury establishment catering to celebrities and the famous world-wide.<br /><br />Hugues loved what he was doing but was devastated when his wife ran off with a rock star, leaving him with a four-year-old daughter, Heloise, to bring up. However, Heloise is an enchanting child and is adored by all the hotel staff and has a happy life in the hotel. She grows up and goes to hotel school in Switzerland, while Hugues eventually finds a new love. Heloise also finds romance and dreamed of running the hotel herself someday, and not surprisingly the reader knows this will happen. Perhaps I've read too many Danielle Steel novels, but while well written, the plot in this one is predictable and not as interesting as it could have been.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|\\"When you're 16, they call it `Sweet Sixteen,' when you're 18, you get to drink, vote, and see dirty movies. What the hell do you get to do when you're 19?\\" That's the main question the four protagonists of the movie-Dave, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher- try to figure out. Breaking Away was released in 1979 and filmed by English director Peter Yates, who also  directed the Steve McQueen movie, Bullitt. Although the movie did poorly in the box office, it received critical acclaim  and ended up being nominated for Best Picture in the 1980 Academy Awards, and won Best Original Screenplay. Breaking Away centers on these four friends as they struggle to come to terms with life after high school, and an inner desire to be somebody.      The plot plays out like this: Dave Stoller and his friends have just graduated from high school having no intentions of going to college and not worrying about the future whatsoever. They live in the small, college town of Bloomington, Indiana, home to Indiana University, Bloomington. To the college kids, the four guys are called, \\"Cutters\\" the nickname given to the townies of Bloomington. There's a rivalry between the townies and college kids that is seen throughout the movie, especially to Mike, who sees them as \\"rich\\" kids who get everything they want. The film mainly focuses on Dave, who is a cyclist and becomes obsessed with the Italian bicycling team, as he himself attempts to turn himself Italian, which drives his parents insane.      Breaking Away is an engaging coming of age movie that tells a story of a group of friends living in a small town, and are unsure of whether they actually want to \\"break away\\" from their small town lives. The film gives the audience something relatable; points in life where we ask the questions: Where does life take us after high school? Am I really ready to be an adult? Where do I belong in the world? Through the point of view of these four friends, especially Dave, the audience sees these characters try tofind an identity and a place to belong. Their plan is to \\"waste their lives together,\\" they soon recognize that eventually things do change.      Writer by Steve Tesich, who won  Best Screenplay in 1980, gave Breaking Away that witty, smart and heartfelt charm that makes it the great movie it is. There are so many quotes I can pick from, but yet don't know where to start! I like the scenes where the friends hang out in the quarry, their usual meeting place, and just joke around with each other. In the beginning, Cyril stomps on the stone and says, \\"STOP...It was somewhere along here where I lost all interest in life...AHA! It was right here, this is where I saw Delores Rineky and Fat Marvin! WHY DELORES WHY!\\"  Or another great quote from Cyril, after Mike asks him how he got so stupid, is, \\"I don't know... I guess I just have a dumb heredity. What's your excuse, Michael?\\" Anything Cyril says cracks me up (which I will get to later!)      The heartwarming scenes definitely come from Dave's parents, who play an integral part of the film. They are bewildered by Dave's desire to be  Italian. Most importantly, Ray, Dave's dad, is worried about Dave and his future. A line that always gets me is, \\"When I was young, I was tired and miserable.\\" A shot that is so heartbreaking is the look on Dave's face when the Italians cheat in the big race in Indianapolis. One of the Italians used a stick to hit Dave's bike, causing him to fall. Dave is heartbroken and distraught; he can't believe that his idols have done something like this. Upon coming home, Dave, all teary-eyed, says to his dad, \\"Everybody cheats. I just didn't know it.\\" It's a realization for Dave, and his father starts to understand how important this race was for him.   The bike scenes are great moments, too.  Whenever Dave races, the same song always plays (`Symphony No. 4 in A major (Italian Symphony), Opus 90') and it intensifies the scene. The camera focuses on Dave and particular the movement of his legs, whichshows how dedicated Dave is to bicycling. The ending is by far the best racing scene, you just want them to beat the college students so bad, and I end up cheering every time they win!     The movie wouldn't be great without these four characters, each one serves a purpose and audiences can find something in common with. Dennis Christopher (Dave), a very young Dennis Quaid (Mike), Daniel Stern (Cyril), and Jackie Earle Haley (Moocher) give notable performances. And Dave's parents, Barbara Barrie as Evelyn Stoller and Paul Dooley as Ray Stoller, also provide terrific performances. Dave acts as the determined and dedicated friend, Mike is the rebel and no-nonsense guy of the bunch, Cyril is the witty and smart guy, who mainly serves as the comic relief, and finally Moocher is the optimistic and easy-going guy (but don't call him \\"Shorty!\\") Dave's passion is cycling. Ever since he won an Italian bike in a race, he practically transformed himself to be Italian. He starts to speak Italian, listen to Italian music, sings Italian songs-the whole nine yards. He even pretends to be an Italian exchange student to impress a college girl he likes! Mike is the guy who takes no gruff from anyone; he does not care about his plans whatsoever and does what he pleases. A part of him though is scared of what he is going to become. As I said before, Cyril is the comic relief, usually trying to make situations lighthearted. (I must add another line of what he says! After Mike's older cop brother asks how the guys are doing, Cyril replies, \\"Well, we're a little disturbed by developments in the Middle East, but...\\"). And lastly, there's Moocher. Moocher is a short guy, and all his life he has been made fun of as a midget. If someone calls him \\"shorty,\\" he will immediately start a fight! But otherwise, I think Moocher is the only one who has his mind straight of what he wants to do. He marries his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and realizes that they all have to go on their own ways. In the course of the summer, the guys figure out together where they belong and search for an identity.      The main themes that are presented in Breaking Away are growing up, identity, and friendship. The four guys are so confused about what they want to do; they would rather just do nothing and stick together until the end, since that's their only plan they have so far. Cyril puts it best, as he says, \\"I wouldn't mind I was somebody myself\\" as the guys try to be `a somebody.' I think their feeling of being someone stems from the college students of IU, who to them, are seen as kids \\"who've got it made,\\" but Mike says, \\"that's because they're rich.\\" Mike is definitely the one who wants to prove to these college kids that the \\"cutters\\" are somebody; to prove that they are better. Mike was somebody in high school; he was a football quarterback. He's tired of reading about some hot-shot college kid in the newspaper every day, and that it's never going to him. He puts it best by, \\"Cutters...to them it's a dirty word...to me it's something I never got the chance to be.\\" Cyril also deals with that fact that his father thinks he's a failure. Cyril thought he was going to get a basketball scholarship, but didn't, his dad \\"loves to be understanding when he fails.   Dave is probably the most disillusioned of them all, as he becomes Italian! I think Dave does this because he thinks Italians are winners, and he wants to be a winner, too, so if he acts Italian, he will be somebody. But acting Italian makes him lose a sense of who he is. When he meets Kathy, Dave says his name is Enrico, and speaks in an Italian accent. He is afraid that she wouldn't like him because he is a townie. Being a \\"townie\\" I think makes the four friends afraid in a sense they'll stay there for the rest of their lives and not live out to be something greater.      There's this scene of when the guys are in the quarry and they argue about the future. Moocher screams at Mike, \\"You're not the quarterback here,Mike!\\" Mike says, \\"At least I was one! Better being a midget my whole life!\\" This brings that Mike is afraid of the college kids, now that high school is over; his shot of being \\"someone\\" is over. He detests the college students because they are smart and successful. The guys realize that their dream of \\"wasting the rest of their lives together\\" will not last for long, and that eventually they have to grow up and go their own ways sometime.      In the end though, the guys know that they'll always be each other's friends and they will have each other's backs, At the Indy 500 race, Moocher, Mike, and Cyril agree to help Dave win the race. All four of them participate in the race, with Dave of course, winning it for them. In that moment, they were somebodies. They helped each other out and pushed each other to achieve that moment of victory and triumph. The moment they stand up on the podium, receiving that trophy, was a feeling of defiance; they proved that they were proud to be \\"cutters.\\" For them, \\"cutters\\" is who they are, and all along they were somebody.     Breaking Away is that little film that is not widely popular, but upon discovering it, it's a piece of cinema that strings your heart and takes you to a place in life where you felt like a Dave, or a Mike, a Moocher, or a Cyril. Peter Yates' vision and Steve Tesich's writing present a film where life does go on after high school. It's a terrifying and exciting journey, a journey that helps you find your niche in the world and individuality. Somewhere along the way though, there's recognition that in life, you have to grow up and settle down.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|Death Comes to Pemberley is a cut above the other Austen sequel books out there.  She avoids the most common pitfalls of Austen sequels - unwieldy language, character assassination, carelessness with details of the original, and turning Pride and Prejudice into a romance novel (Linda Berdoll, I'm looking at you). Elizabeth and Darcy are fully imagined characters with a loving but realistic relationship, something that would have pleased Austen herself. But while it's a well written and engaging book, James is clearly not at home in Austen's world. The premise (murder mystery at Pemberley) is incompatible with original Austen, and James clearly feels the constraint and never gets comfortable with the limitations it puts on her story. She is wise enough to recognize that Darcy and Elizabeth could not turn amateur sleuth given their position, and lets events unfold around the characters, which eventually reveals the solution.   When working in her own style, P.D. James is an extraordinary mystery author and the Dalgliesh series is one of my all time favorites. Death Comes to Pemberley is disappointing mostly because it's an Austen sequel by P.D. James rather than a P.D. James mystery. If you're a Dalgliesh fan desperate for new James, you're probably better off rereading the Private Patient. If you're an Austen fan tempted by James' reputation into reading an Austen sequel, I suggest rereading Austen herself.  James makes an admirable attempt, but she can't replicate Austen's sparkling wit or her ease in genteel society. If you're an Austen fan who already enjoys Austen sequels, Death to Pemberley is well worth your time. If you're a James fan bent on reading it anyways, accept it for what it is, and you'll enjoy it as well.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I admit, I was skeptical before I bought this book.  I worried it would be manipulative or schmaltzy.  This book, however, defied my expectations.  It was genuine and exceptionally well-written.  The story is told from the perspective of Enzo, an insightful dog.  The choice of narrator was not at all distracting or read as a contrivance.  The story also was about racing and, at times, incorporated technical elements.  Again, I chalk this up to the skill of the author, Garth Stein: the elements added to the story.  I'm hardly a racing fanatic, but I loved the way Stein incorporated racing into the story.  Had this not been a Kindle recommendation, I'd never have picked up the story.  So glad I did.  Read it; you won't be disappointed.

032147404X|5.0|I have read a lot of photography books and this is the best book I have seen on simply describing many ways to get a good picture, without all the complications of the technical jargon included. Although this is a great reference, it would be better to read the book all the way through because many of the individual techniques are not obvious from the table of contents, and just having the knowledge before taking pictures helps one to think things through more wisely. The tips are however arranged by major topic, such as how to take landscape pictures or photograph a wedding. So just reading that section before the event or trip you plan to photo would be invaluable. Each tip is on one page, easy to read with a beautiful photo as an example of the tip described. I think if a person learned the stuff in this book well they would be miles ahead of the average amateur photographer! Might be the only book an amateur would ever need to read. Great book, I highly recommend it.

I hope I don't have problems with this one either. I just wish Amazon would do something about this type of false advertising.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King has already proven everything he has to prove to ensure himself a place among great American novelists. He's had tremendous successes and not a few misses; some of his stories could use a slightly more courageous editor.  As a fan of time travel novels, I loved 11/22/63. It said what had to be said and ended how it had to be ended. As most people have discussed the plot, I am reminded of just how powerfully King can use words. There is a scene where a character is beaten. King made that scene come alive.  I could almost feel the bruises.  Well done.

I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORDS STEVIE SANG OVER THE RADIO.  BUT THE QUALITY OF THIS DVD IS SUCH THAT I CAN.  DIDN'T KNOW HOW DEEP HER SONGS WERE.  MOVING MUSIC BY ALL 3 SINGERS.

0307352145|4.0|As an introvert myself I have always felt inferior at school and work compared to my very talkative counterparts. This book will certainly make you feel better if you have been led to believe that only extrovert personalities will ever lead successful lives.  For successful introverts the trick seems to be to use your strengths and accept your weaknesses and find your niche...don't bother trying to fake being an extrovert there is no need for more of them.    At times I did find this book a little scatter-brained.... it went all over the place and was a little hard to follow.  Sometimes I couldn't figure out what it's actual arguement was...  I recommend it if you need a boost and would like to find out who else is an introvert other than you, some being obvious and others being very surprising.
1451648537|5.0|I enjoyed listening this book I could not put it down  Steve Jobs' passion for work and his private life were described in detail.  I was amazed by his personality and charisma. People need leaders.   As the one who grow up in Russian his communications skills and the way he demanded from his people results are not that shocked for me, Not at all, many great Russian sportsman's were treated exactly like this by the trainers and people reach unbelievable results.  It was a very well written book. and very well read by Dylan Baker. Thank you
B005IGVZX2|1.0|I ordered this item (supposedly the LP + CD) based on the editorial review saying that the price included both CD and album.  To my dismay this is not the case.  I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement - only the album but no CD.  So, for those who are purchasing this item expecting both formats, my experience is that you will only get the album.  I sure would like to know if there are others out there who have faced this same problem.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The cover itself is good.  I mean it's not leather but it provides protection for the Fire which is what we wanted. The Fire fits in perfectly and the slip resistant texture is good for a fumble fingers like me. Not sure how durable it will be and it was pricey but overall so far I'm satisfied.  Why it took over two weeks get to our house is a mystery?  That two day prime shipping was obviously lost somewhere over Cleveland.

0312430000|5.0|The author uses real life stories to reinforce the use of checklists for all types of tasks.  Examples of checklists implemented range from the critically important, such as flying a plane or performing surgery, to the mundane, like baking cake or going on vacation.  I used checklists before I read this book, but just for the most important tasks.  After reading \\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" right before I leave for home in the afternoon, I make a list of the tasks I need to accomplish for tomorrow.  My work checklist has increased my productivity and has made me better organized.

The examples given in the book are extremely interesting.  Highly recommended!

This is the most simple art application I've ever used and as an artist that is important.  Sincerely, Me

Download this app, you won't regret it!
B005ARYEPK|5.0|I went to the movies and watched the new Footloose and had to find the old one to buy and watch it too.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I rented this movie mainly because I like both actors.The story itself was good, & it moved, as opposed to some that just drag on. What I really did not like was the language. I do not mind an occasional cuss word..however, this movie was continual..and mostly the F word. Really that was a bit much..& unnecessary.  With 1/3 of that language I would have given this a 5 star.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|A lot of viewer negative criticism is centered on the script; obsession with over sexed girls and visual violence. If one listens to the dialogue you'll discover that the film is largely a humorous parody of zombie films, female subservience, Japanese anime and guy's action flicks. Once I figured that out the movie took on a whole new perspective. A great homage to 28 Days/Weeks ...  As far as the animation, to me anime is visually boring with a flat simplistic non-changing background coupled with a single, sometimes moving and sometimes not moving, animation in the foreground I thought that these animators were effective in conveying the story given the limitations of the medium.
B005I6EU48|5.0|My favorite thing about this cover is the looks, but it also keeps my Kindle Fire safe and secure.    The elastic straps are extremely snug, but really not difficult at all to get around the Fire. I'm glad they are so snug, because it keeps the device from moving around. I'm not concerned that they will loosen over time because after 3 weeks, I've never felt the need to take it out of the case. The straps do partially cover the speakers on top, but I can't tell that it makes any difference to the volume at all.    When I fist put my Fire in it, the front flap of the case did not lie completely flat, but after 3 weeks, it closes perfectly.  Just be patient and let time and gravity work it out!  One nice-to-have would be the ability to easily prop the Fire on a table at angle to watch a video. If that's important to you, you should probably look elsewhere. But if you just want a cool cover that protects the device and looks an old antique book instead of a shiny new mobile tablet, it's fabulous!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Great even for those of us with no artistic ability. I just used it to explain a layout with a rough drawing. A pic really is worth 1,000 words.

1451648537|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book because it reminded me of other stories I've heard about a minority of very smart college students. Steve Jobs would probably have fit right into a small group of college students who touted their genius, insulted others without warning and would proclaim that things were either insanely great or stupid (or worse!). Isaacson I'm sure tried his best to understand how Jobs could behave this way and it became a dominant theme in this book. He might have had a better time of it had he spend a few years at a science and engineering college where budding geniuses with Mr. Jobs' personality were brought down to size daily. After all, not everyone gets to be Emperor like Steve did at such a young age supporting his sense of self worth. Most go to work for someone else early in their career and get a lesson in behavior when they are still mallable enough to accept it. Steve Jobs, rewarded while he was still young with sizeable wealth (deservedly so) apparently raised this behavior to a high art form according to Mr Isaacson. Of course, as Isaacson makes perfectly clear Steve was a genius, countering this character fault, with major contributions in computers, annimated graphics (Pixar), telephony, music distribution and publishing and this really doesn't consider the iPad. The iPad certainly looks as if it will change how we interface and use computers yet again, further enhancing Steve's legacy. Sometimes people are given undo credit when they do sometime great because luck and opportunity may play an important part. But Steve did it multiple times. The formation of Apple, then Pixar, then the rescue of Apple and and then creation of the iMAC, and then the iPod and then modifications of music distribution and then the iPad cannot be all luck or opportunistic. They have to be the work of a genius as Isaacson points out on more than one occasion.  Not all the book discusses his business creations and genius. I could not help chuckling a bit when Isaacson describes how Job agonized over his choice of girl friends and wife. In choosing between two women he knew well, he started to ask others which of the woman had the better personallity, which was prettier! I gather they were both pretty. Fortunately, we are told that he picked the one that was better suited for him and the book never describes any marriage strife.   This book should, of course be on the reading list for just about any Business School. Probably anyone entering Business School in the next year who has not read this book should seriously consider whether he or she has what it takes to become a major player in industry. Middle management might be a better choice. That said, very few individuals could get away with behaving as Steve did for very long. They would be cut down to size by those with more power but less ability. And that brings us to an important issue I have with this book and perhaps with Steve's ultimate legacy.   Isaacson, an excellent biographer, picked by Steve Jobs probably because he felt that Isaacson was part of the \\"A Team\\" of biographers, could never tell us how or if Apple would succeed after Jobs. Hopefully Steve Jobs left Apple with a cadre of A Team players who have a few insanely great products in the pipeline. Of course, even if he knew, Isaacson could not say what these might be. Nevertheless, because Jobs was always in the decision loop and could and did make major design changes that everyone in the book says really improved the product one has to wonder if future devices will have the same impact. Isaacson doesn't discuss any recent major items that were designed without Jobs' involvement (obsession, actually) and I can only hope that Jobs' trained his people well. But technical companies have few cash cows to tide them over when changes occur. Every few years they must bet the company on some new thing or stop growing. This book was probably rushed to market shortly after Steve's death and consequently cannot provide the type of long insight that can put an individual's life into prospective. The unanswered question is will Apple continue to fascinate now that Steve is gone

1461190460|1.0|I ordered a *new* copy of The Little Prince from Amazon and received a bootlegged copy of the book. Most likely illegal. There are typos, and the illustrations are photocopied, black & white, reduced in size, poor quality, and pixelated. The book is not formatted or designed like the original. There is no publisher listed, no copyright, no information about who printed and distributed the book. What's worse is that I sent it as a gift, but luckily the person who received it understood what happened. I want my money back, and I don't think that the recipient should have to go through the trouble of returning the book because Amazon messed up.

B0068TJLSY|1.0|Not sure what movie many people were watching based on the reviews praising the film but I found the story line just to be ok and the ending to be really dumb. It felt like the film was trying to hit me over the head with some subtle political message (like Avatar).
B001AII4RM|4.0|\\"We men are the monsters now.\\"  Robert Zemeckis's \\"Beowulf\\" has, I think, been grossly misunderstood. The popular consensus appears to be that it is another mo-cap failure, all exaggerated, adolescent, computer-generated violence with zero substance. While the film certainly has its flaws, the visual effects techniques employed to create it have apparently blinded many to its rather clever deconstruction of the Beowulf story.  Now, it's inarguable that the original poem is a treasured literary classic, but what some of the more \\"academic\\" reviews either don't seem to grasp or conveniently choose to ignore is that the poem is over a thousand years old and is an entirely different medium to the modern blockbuster; literature is an individual experience, interpreted through the prism of the reader's - or listener's, if hearing an oration - imagination while film is a defined, temporal experience intended for a mass audience. What works in one can be disastrous in another.  The key obstacle in adapting \\"Beowulf\\" is the narrative structure. The story is split between three battles: Grendel, Grendel's mother, and the Dragon. Classical three-act structure, you say? Not quite. There's a fifty year gap between the last two acts. Furthermore, Beowulf himself is a static character, an idealized hero without flaw. These present no real issue in poetic verse, but in a film that is expected to flow smoothly from narrative point A to narrative point B in two hours or less, a static protagonist will bore the audience and such an enormous time shift will seem unjustified.  Therefore, writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary strove to accomplish with their adaptation what any good adaptation ought to do -- find a new reason to tell this ancient tale. They asked questions: why won't Grendel attack Hrothgar? Because no one else actually saw what happened in the cave with Grendel's mother, what if what Beowulf recited isn't the truth? These questions led to a deconstruction of the original narrative where Beowulf is an unreliable narrator and he and the characters suffer from the all-too human traits of greed, pride, lust, and envy. Now, the long gap between the final acts is motivated through exploring Beowulf's regret at the decisions he's made in his life that now tie into the confrontation with the Dragon. The conceit is that this version is the \\"original\\" version of the story before it became what we now know in the poem.  The beauty of this conceit is that it makes the nature of storytelling itself one of the film's themes. Beowulf is presented as an exaggerating braggart and even an outright liar concerning his early exploits. After Beowulf is crowned and they perform his \\"song\\" decades later, the depiction of Grendel's disarming corresponds to the bare-handed version in the original poem and not the mechanically-assisted version we saw take place earlier in the film; the story has evolved to be bolder and more heroic than the reality. The implication is that this same change has happened to the rest of the story over time, the character's flaws were lost and he became the idealized hero of the poem. (This is also hinted at the film's treatment of Christianity as a rising religion among a rowdy pagan culture, closer to historical reality of the time the poem is set, while the poem of course portrays its heroes as good Christian men.)  The introduction of character flaws into the narrative provides room for character development and greater psychological reality over the course of the film narrative, but it also ties into the theme of storytelling and sets up the ambiguous ending, which I won't spoil here. Why do we tell the stories of heroes such as Beowulf? Why are they so idealized? The answer is so that we mere mortals may be inspired by these stories to overcome our flaws, to avoid the mistakes of the past, and to hope for a better future. This is the position that Wiglaf (and the audience) is left in at the end of the film: is he doomed tosuccumb to temptation and corruption like those who came before him, or can the tale and memory of those such as Beowulf give him the strength and courage to resist?  It's a new and interesting layer to the story, providing greater dimension and expressing an interesting, meta-textual perspective on the poem - a companion, not a replacement. There's more to cover here - too much, really - but hopefully it's apparent that there is indeed more to this film than what meets the eye.  Is the film a masterpiece? No. For all the intelligent choices made in the adaptation, the execution seems a bit off. Post-\\"300\\", the soundtrack is sprinkled with distorted electric guitar riffs to let the teenage boys know that, no, really, this story is COOL. During Beowulf's fight with Grendel, the constant and convenient coverage of his genitals quickly becomes an annoying joke. The animation, while often breathtakingly detailed and beautiful, occasionally looks dull and lifeless; the heightened realism of the motion-capture movements highlights some of the faults of the rendered character designs and lighting. Lastly, while going all-digital has freed up Zemeckis's camera to create some mind-bogglingly creative and awesome shots, he does have a tendency to go over-the-top and his direction calls attention to itself; a tad more restraint could have made this film a classic. As is, it's solid entertainment.  The Blu-ray itself showcases exemplary picture and sound, as well as a couple of hours of documentaries and deleted scenes, all presented in high definition. It's not a Criterion-worthy package, but it gets the job done and is worthwhile.  If you can accept that the poem is the poem and the film is the film, this disc is highly recommended.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for this website, but I have to tell somebody - THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!!  Now I am not one of your old school fans; I picked up a copy of Rubber Factory a couple of years ago on a recommendation from this very site.  And since then I have had some type of Black Keys album in rotation.  At last count I had six albums.  I have always enjoyed their more upbeat songs, so imagine my delight when I listened to this and heard nothing but pure upbeat goodness from beginning to end.  This is the toe-tappin', head-bobbin' kind of goodness ya'll.  Do yourself a favor if you are a fan of the Black Keys happier tunes and buy this album!!

Still, the CPU contact plate could be all-copper and completely flat for even better heat dispersion. But that would be a twice as expensive part.  So I'm giving it full 5 stars.

0547258305|3.0|Kristin Cashore begins her novel with a dark heroine in a troubled setting. Katsa is her uncle's \\"lady killer.\\" Graced from childhood with an ability to kill, Katsa learns to have very few friends and keep herself numb of the emotions of others around her.   Thats is, until she meets Po, a Lienid prince who shows up at her uncle's castle looking for his kidnapped grandfather. As Katsa learns to trust and eventually love Po, she finds herself along the way. They team up to find his grandfather's abductor, traveling across the country side to Monsea where the king is hiding a deadly secret. Katsa and Po wind up trying to rescue King Leck's young daughter from his own hands.    My only complaint with this book is that I'm disappointed to have been built up and excited as I read through the plot, only to find a lack-luster ending.   I felt the last 60 pages were rushed. The defeat of the evil King Leck wasn't nearly as satisfying as it should have been. The ending just wasn't strong. The reader is swept along in the whirlwind of events that occur after the understated climax, and it seems the remaining surprises are wrapped up much too quickly.  I'm giving this book three stars for its fast-pace beginning and entertaining storyline, and hesitantly  recommend it to readers of young adult fantasy, particularly those who like a love story woven into the fabric of fantasy.

0321704452|5.0|The first thing that strikes me about the book is its elegant design, simplistic feel and logical layout. It successfully captures the essence of the message conveyed throughout the book and sets the stage for an engaging and creative presentation, which truly practices what the author is preaching.  There are a number of books about presentations out there, and many of them contain most advices found in this book; but this book distinguishes itself through its cheer elegance and stellar demonstrative style. The author does a great job of cutting right to the chase and gives tons of great advice and really good information on how to take your presentation skills to the next level. The author aims at teaching us how to communicate the essence of our message by stripping away all that is unnecessary and embracing the ideas of simplicity, clarity, honesty, integrity and most importantly passion. The concept of \\"nakedness\\" or \\"naturalness\\" is used in a superb metaphor to explain the need to remove all barriers between the presenter and his or her audience, and to transform presentations into genuine and honest discussions.   Overall, the book was a reading delight! Very well written and superbly presented. Though the book might not be the best start for the very novice, it contains invaluable advice and insightful information that make it a must read! I would advice this to anyone seeking to better their presentation skills.
0393338398|3.0|At first I loved Moneyball. The idea of Sabermetrics to analyze baseball has been very compelling to me since I discovered Bill James many years ago. If you are not familiar with the unique Sabermetric baseball stats to analyze games, Moneyball will teach you about them and their importance. The book is very readable and should open the eyes of many casual baseball fans.<br /><br />My problem with Moneyball is that it is way too short. It reads like an extended magazine article, and almost completely ignores pitching and defense. Yes, offense is an important part of the game, but you will not win unless you score more runs than the opponent, and this is where defense and pitching come in. Ignoring these fundamentals leaves out huge chunks of the game. Also, since the book focuses on the Oakland A's of the American League, the strategy involved with pitchers batting, so integral to National League baseball, is left out entirely.<br /><br />Moneyball, although interesting on the offensive side of baseball, highlights the damage that the designated hitter in the American League has done to a very intricate and strategic game. In the book the A's manager is portrayed as a mere figurehead, perching on the dugout steps for ideal television shots while his team monotonously cycles through hitter after hitter, with no stolen bases, bunts, or double switches even considered. It is simply a boring offensive machine. Taking into account pitchers who have to bat, pinch hitters, defensive replacements and the like turns the game of baseball into a fascinating chess match instead of a mere footrace round and round the base paths.<br /><br />So, read Moneyball for an introduction to the fascinating world of Sabermetrics as they relate to offensive baseball, but don't expect gold here. Baseball is about a lot more than piling on the runs for the sake of quick-fix television ratings.
0312430000|4.0|The book was eye opening! I somehow knew it was helpful to have checklists but did not give them that much importance and did not see their necessity.  The book made me realize their purpose, importance and benefits.   Using some pretty fascinating stories and striking illustrations, the author explained that checklists are not only a useful management tool, they are a critical one! Checklists help insure the processes and protocols are properly followed and carried out. When used properly, they can help foresee and prevent potential complications and bring out the true potential of team work. Checklists help insure tasks are performed and schedules are respected.    Though I felt the stories were sometime over stretched and the book turned more into a novel with mini parts, it was very well written and definitely a good read.
1439102732|5.0|What prompted me to buy this book was the premise of the story itself and the fact that a main stream author wrote a story dealing with LGBT issues.  There are three main characters, Zoe, Max, and Vanessa.  The story is told from each of their perspectives but follows the main story of Zoe.  For most of Zoe and Max's marriage they struggle with infertility issues and trying to have a child.  Following the last miscarriage their marriage falls apart.  As Zoe pieces her life back together she finds love in an unexpected place.  Max on the other hand turns to alcohol and eventually finds religion in the form of a conservative Christian religious group.  The story follows Zoe's desire to start a family with her new spouse, Vanessa, and the ramifications of that from the point of view of each of the main protagonists.  There are a lot of stories in the news these days involving same-sex marriage, the proponents and opponents: the effects on the \\"traditional\\" family versus the rights of individuals.  Jodi Picoult does a wonderful job of portraying both sides of the debate in a safe, engrossing story.  There are certainly characters in this book that people will not like, depending on your perspective, but I believe that the way she strikes a chord with the reader also opens the door for some interesting discussions.  I haven't gotten a full grasp of all the thoughts that are swirling around in my head as a result of reading this story.  I know many of them were already swirling around but it's as if some mental piece of my thoughts have broken loose and I need to get a handle on what that means.  I'm sure I'll get to that in the near future.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We have enjoyed this set as a family - a great way to spend time with teens. A wonderful package containing hours of excellent Harry Potter action.
B0000521G7|1.0|I've heard good things but since the one I received only plays in some other part of the world I couldn't say. And Wally of Amazon can't seem to find a U.S. version I guess I'm just FOL.

B0000A14WB|5.0|One of the best music purchases I've ever made.  I'm not a huge Beach Boys fan, but this is something else.  This DVD-A has advanced resolution Mono, Stereo, and 5.1, and it's all simply amazing.  I've heard all the songs like Sloop John B and God Only Knows, but never the album as a whole.  Brian Wilson truly is a genius.  Listening to other music from this era...you can tell just how advanced he was.  If you're new to liking the Beach Boys and expecting a lot of surfing summertime music, you'll be disappointed.  This is something much more mature and profound.  An excellent album, on an excellent format.  I wish DVD-A was more popular, because it's a great way to enjoy music and hear things that you couldn't before.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|I bought these for our 3 month old granddaughter.  The bright colors really catch her attention, but the fabric is not like a sock and does not stretch.  We also bought the other set that has the solid color sock and those stretch and fit on the feet perfectly.  She still love the color and plays with them in her hand, but  not what they were made for.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this album for my wife and it was certainly the right move. If you or your wife love Christmas music, this is a great additional to your collection. Buble's voice is extremely rich and his interpretation of some songs is different but good. There were a few songs that weren't my particular taste but no one can deny that this man can sing. Great Christmas gift!
B006I07E3W|5.0|A lot takes place in this episode but nothing clicks as strongly as the emergence of Will Gardener as less desirable than Peter Florek as husband material.  I felt he was absolutely worm like in this episode. When this series began I think everyone saw this show going in the direction of Alicia ending up with Will.  I would be very surprised if anyone wants it to go in that direction now.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox makes his reappearance in this episode.  This is one of the best parts on the show so I am always eager for his arrival with the many contradictions in his character. He is full of those tonight.<br /><br />The daughter has a serious problem emerging with her attraction to the extreme religious right. Both of her parents need to become a lot more vigilant and supervisory with her. Much as I don't like Jackie the grandmother, maybe Grace would be better off with her.  Her grandmother realizes how much danger she is in and presumably would head her off at the pass.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|If you change the theme in such a drastic fashion, you should make it where you can change it back... I perfered the dark theme...
B006I0ZLU0|3.0|This show is rather lamely making it to the end of its series life.  if it weren't the very end, i would just stop watching it. What the plot line has come down to is that Bree's former cop boyfriend is pursuing Bree, Susan, Gabby and Lynette to punish Bree for turning down his proposal. This is for Carlos's killing Gabby's molester stepfather and all of the women burying and concealing his body.<br /><br />I don't find it particularly believable in a suburban police department that the cop is able to use all of his department's resources and with no evidence conduct detailed witness interview after interview with these women down at the station.  Typically such resources are stretched pretty thin and this would be very noticeable to his superiors. All the women turn on Bree for her making the situation worse by assuming control without their consent.  Bree starts drinking again.  We again seem to be hurtling towards a spinoff called DESPERATE CELLMATES, which I for one will not be watching.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|I am one of Amy Winehouse's biggest fans, but even I have to say that this album is a disappointment.  I assumed it was going to be all new tracks, but at least four of them have already been released in different versions.  I wonder if what's on this CD are test versions that didn't make the cut?  That's the problem w/ posthumous releases... the artist doesn't get to approve the material.  I do like LIKE SMOKE w/ Nas.  Amy, we miss you and love you.

It is a little difficult to climb onto the seat and maneuver the scoop but he can practice and use it in the snow or beach sand for scooping up.As he gets a little older he will have complete command of the cat.I recommend it for age 2 and up but age 3 would probably be best.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game displays perfectly while holding the tablet horizontally.  Not as easy as most others to win.  The graphic choices are easy on the eyes.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|I just want to comment on one aspect of 'Wrath'. With all of Lamb of God's previous records the formula has been the same: start each album off with the big single. From black label (from New American Gospel) to Run (As the Palaces Burn), Laid to Rest (Ashes of the Wake) and Walk with Me in Hell (Sacrament, which REALLY annoyed me. Does anything think a track with the title Again We Will Rise should open an album?)<br /><br />Albums are like novels or a collection of poetry, arrangement is key. A track list just shouldn't be thrown together willy nilly. And I think LoG really got to right with 'Wrath'. Opening with an instrumental track (i.e. The Passing) is a first for these guys, but once you get beyond that surprise you realize it's an incredibly well crafted instrumental. It's utterly beautiful, a word seldom used in heavy metal.<br /><br />The Passing leads into In Your Words, and the rest is history so to speak. I think each song has a personality of its own, which secures a lack of dull moments. The album's closing track really wraps things up. Reclamation begins acoustically, just as The Passing does. It livens up to a pace of churning doom, littered with Randy Blythe's musings of man's destruction of earth. It's crushing.<br /><br />I'm not saying the other LoG albums lack good album closers. Vigil (off As the Palaces Burn) and Remorse is for the Dead (Ashes of the Wake) are standout tracks, while Beating On Death's Door (Sacrament) is heavy, but feels like a throwaway. I haven't listened to O.D.H.G.A.B.F.E. (off New American Gospel) in a while to comment on it.<br /><br />In short, good albums have memorable beginning and ending tracks to act as bookends.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I usually don't like movies about kids, but this one had the same kind of appeal that Goonies had.  It does draw you in.  It also has one of the best train wrecks I've ever seen in a movie.  If you listened to certain dialogue midway through the movie, you got tipped off as to what would ultimately happen.  It's been a very long time since I was a kid and I had to laugh about how serious they were about their movie project.  Still, they were quite believable and the mix of character personalities was good.  Ron Eldard, whose name, I had to look up, put in a very nice performance.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the pieces fit together a little too neatly, at the end.  Still, a fun movie.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I've loved every one of Martin's preceding books in this series.  Unfortunately, book five falls short of the excellence we've come to expect from the author.  Reading this book has been like talking to my mother-in-law on the phone.  That is to say, Martin goes on and on, in excruciating detail, about people and situations that have no apparent bearing on the real story.  This book is a long, tedious read.  I have yet to finish it, and I started it almost two months ago.  For an avid reader, that should speak volumes!<br /><br />I hope that he brings the story back around in book six and that it's not another disappointment.

140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom has done it again, this time with a return to real life but retaining that amazing gift of clarity of thought and spiritual perception. The characters of the story come to life in his hands and the parallel walk of the rabbi and the down town preacher come in from a life of crime are amazingly intertwined in a book that warms the heart and stirs emotions and thoughts untouched for some time.  Mitch challenges us all to think more about where we have come from why we are here and how we better relate to our neighbour in this frenetic world we inhabit.  Thank you Mitch Albom for showing us more of the deeper things of life.
0321704452|4.0|Reynolds took a totally different approach to presentation and public speaking.  I was amazed to learn that being natural and showing emotion was/is a good thing. He encourages the reader to strip away fake pretenses and be natural, conversational delivering presentations.   I was impressed with the ideal of visualizing a presentation less of a performance and more of a conversational dialogue.  Reynolds illustrates simplicity and complexity of delivering a speech in a natural stance, standing away from a lectern, by placing more priority on engaging your audience.  What I found most interesting and relevant were the \\"Presentation Tips from a Steve Jobs Keynote,\\" such as develop a rapport with the audience, give them an idea of where you're going, show your enthusiasm, etc.\\" After the recent death of Steve Jobs I began to notice of his delivery style, command of his audience, brilliant mind, and his willingness to define how we present, connect with and engage our audiences to communicate an idea.    The author is prolific, insightful, and thought provoking in his delivery, and yet, there were some repetitive concepts across the overall theme.  I realize the book is a collection of presentation tips by speakers that illustrate the transparent, emotion, \\"naturalness in delivery - bringing more of your own unique personality to your presentations-will amplify your messages in a way that will get them noticed, understood, and remembered.
0375805613|5.0|This book is a family favorite.  When this book first came out, I remember reading it to my little brother.  My brothers and I *all* loved this book.  When it was re-released I bought enough copies so that each of my brothers could have one and I could have one for each of *my* kids.  One brother's son will be reading it to *his* son soon.  And based on what my teenagers say, they'll be reading it to their kids someday.  This book is funny, it's fun to read, and even once you know the 'twist', it's *still* funny and fun to read.    \\"Lovable furry old Grover\\" is the monster at the end of the book.  Some people want to get philosphical about about the meaning of that.  I think it shows that not everything we are afraid of is frightening--that we can work ourselves up over something, and when it comes right down it, we can handle it--or maybe it wasn't even such a big deal at all.    Even if there's no deep philosophical meaning though, this book is *fun*, and that's reason enough to read it.
015206057X|5.0|Fox's spare, rhyming text spotlights pairs of babies from around the world, connected by the refrain, \\"And both of these babies, as everyone knows, had ten little fingers and ten little toes.\\"  In the last few pages, the panorama narrows to a particular  baby \\"...who was truly divine, a sweet little child who was mine, all mine.\\"  Oxenbury's illustrations never disappoint:  her babies' faces are expressive and exuberant, the delightfully dishevelled mother's final kiss on the tip of her baby's nose a perfect ending.  Great for the lap audience, this book fires on all cylinders.

For the movie/picture quality, they did a great job converting into DVD format. Watched it in our new LED TV and the quality is unreal. Highly recommend for a family movie night.

The Akron, Ohio 2some of guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney release their 7th studio offering since 2002.  \\"El Camino\\", is a great upbeat album, I think some fans might be put off by their upbeat sound here, I love this album, it brings back the 70's for me.  I also think it's their best album since 2004's \\"Rubber Factory\\".  Some of these songs are my top picks, \\"Lonely Boy\\", Dead And Gone\\", \\"Gold On The Celling\\", A true favorite, great guitar by Dan.  \\"Run Right Back\\", \\"Hell Of A Season\\", another favorite track, \\"Nova Baby\\", the mellowest tune on the album \\"Little Black Submarines\\", reminds me of something Led Zeppelin would of done and \\"Mind Eraser\\".  Great listen, love it.  It seems people hate change in direction, I'm 51 and love  their blues roots, but there's nothing wrong with a little change up.

0439023483|4.0|Finally got around to reading this, partly because of the buzz but mostly because my wife loved it. I really did not know what to expect, but was drawn in by the author's fast pacing and compelling story. The story is a gruesome tale - kids killing other kids for sport because of a \\"big brother\\" type of government. It is definitely more violent then your average young adult tale, but on the other hand it is a much better story than most of what's out there. There are some very poignant and compelling dilemmas that readers are forced to work through on their own, and the clear cut moral path is often obscured.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this book to adults, but am torn about recommending it to teens. The love story is pretty tame, but contrived. And the violence is mild, but still over the top for your typical young adult book. At one point in the book, a small girl is captured in a net and pierced with a spear by a large boy, who quickly has an arrow shot through his throat by another girl. On the other hand, there are some great things to think through here and it could be a great book to read along with your kids at an even younger age.<br /><br />From a literary standpoint, I didn't really like the back and forth of the love story. The author tries to hide whether its real, fake, or somewhere in between for most of the book, but its gets old fast. The twist at the end of the hunger games is pretty ridiculous too . . . I felt like a great novel was hijacked by a B-movie at the very end. Just bizarre.<br /><br />In the end, this is a book that is sweeping the nation and will soon be made into a movie. Buy it, read it, and recommend it to young adults with caution. Recommended.

B005FUTBWS|3.0|Warning: May contain Spoilers  Red State begins like your run-of-the-mill abduction/slasher picture. A group of rowdy, sex-fiending teens embark on a quest through the backwoods after discovering a woman willing to pleasure them all simultaneously on a Craigslist-esque website rife with pictures of half-nude women from exotic places like New York or LA. This particular woman, however, the boys soon learn, is not a bodacious dream girl, but a member of a deranged and evangelic religious group who have been periodically abducting and murdering gay folks for the past few weeks. This brings Red State about to the twenty minute mark. Around this time, the leader of the group, a charismatic zealot freak, delivers an especially long sermon then orders his goons to execute someone unrelated to the plot. Soon after, thanks to a coincidental run-in with a gay walking plot device (played by an amiable, blundering Stephen Root) earlier in the film, the police arrive to investigate the zealot's compound. Many, many AK-47s are fired. The stream of profanity that carried the kids through the movie's first act is lessened somewhat and...oh, right-- Enter John Goodman. Goodman's by-the-numbers ATF role is quite enjoyable and realistic and yet, the man looks awful. He limps around, perhaps from an earlier injury that is never explained. His moobs are ginormous and his face is incredibly sallow. Nevertheless, he is convincing and a perfect counterpart to the ridiculous preacher. The rest of the actors are fairly good at their roles and the gore effects (mostly consisting of bloody gunshot wounds) are pretty typical but well-done, the exception being a terrible CGI headshot. Ultimately, Red State is a social commentary on the effects of believers v. non-believers and the convictions that drive both sides--sometimes into lunacy. The movie retains some of Kevin Smith's self-conscious wit, name-dropping The West Burrow Baptist Church at one point, knowing full-well the audience will havealready drawn this parallel.   The second half of the film is dominated by a large-scale shoot-out which is very well done. Frenetic and bloody, this action set-piece is reminiscent of the siege of the Firefly homestead in Rob Zombie's newish classic The Devil's Rejects. While admittedly entertaining, the shoot-out marks the film's jump from the horror element of the first half hour into decidedly action flick territory. This is not necessarily a bad thing, though it is jarring.   Red State is, when the smoke clears, the mark of a low-budget provocateur. It is technically competent and never flashy, but by the same token, there were hardly any moments (aside from John Goodman's electrifying delivery and one fairly brutal execution) that set it apart from other genre fare. Worth a watch to see Kevin Smith succeeding in unfamiliar territory, there is the implicit understanding that without a Hollywood name at the helm, Red State may have been just another socially-conscious B flick relegated to the $5 Wal-Mart bin, where it indeed may show up sometime in the next six months. For $5, however, it would be a steal, a holy crime to pass up.

B000002GVZ|4.0|Ms. Simon's voice and phrases accompanied some very nice times in the 70s along with Carly Simon's incredible contributions. I have been collecting music from this era for years. I return to these various songs over time to enjoy the richness of the music from that time. I know an incredibly beautiful artist that might enjoy this music while working on her art. She is also a memory of mine and a lost love from many years ago.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|love this tool.  i dont need to bring all the drawing materials to create simple drawings!  everything can be done from the fingertips.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I expected a vampire/horror movie.  What I got was a dark and lovely \\"coming of age\\" relationship movie that happened to feature a vampire character.  I fell in love with this movie, and I was absolutely blown away by the talent of the two young actors!   I think a lot of people will find the movie rather slow-moving (ESPECIALLY those expecting the \\"usual\\" vampire genre). I personally didn't find it too slow at all but just right for the relationship between Owen & Abby to connect & grow & become established.  One final note: For me, the most horrific scenes were those depicting the bullying of Owen by classmates. That is NOT a criticism of the film at all. It was realistic and what's truly horrific is that bullying is a terrible fact of life.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I don't understand all the miss information in the reviews, this app syncs easily with Google calendar. I was able to install and tweak to my liking very quickly.  I'd been looking for a time management tool and this fits the bill nicely.    I can't speak to the need for a widget, that's unimportant to me.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Damian Marley is just eclectic!  He loves to experiment with his talent and jumps from a music style to the other.  This is a very interesting fusion of different styles and rithms.  Good job, Damian!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|lots of tools, just wish the paints blended.. maybe im asking for to much but cool app kids will love it
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This review is strictly for the format as the movie is as funny as the first one.  I wish I read the reviews first but not needing a review on the movie I did not think I needed to read them.  I expected a true digital copy as with most Blu-rays that I could download into ITunes but this is not that.  It is some horrible Ultraviolet digitial that forces you to create a Flixster account and download software to view a streaming or local copy.<br /><br />I am going to return this to Amazon and wait until a real digital version is available or just buy the cheaper blu-ray with no digital copy if available.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Rush is a strange phenomenon...and has been for decades. Whether you love or hate their music you can respect the band members as utterly talented instrumentalists who (publicly) mock themselves. Prog rock is always criticized as being \\"pretentious\\" but Rush turns that characterization on its head. They perform dazzling music while appearing to enjoy and laugh at it. Name me another band that is similar...<br /><br />The audience likely isn't quite aware of the skill required to perform at the level they do. To bake in the added humor only demonstrates more-so the fact that Geddy, Alex, and Neil are very humble folk with very uncommon talent.<br /><br />At nearly 60 years-old these guys energetically outperform their grand-kids.<br /><br />Live in Cleveland is a lesson in youth/aging we can all learn from. Remarkable.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I don't use a lot of calendar or tasks apps, but I thought I'd give it a try. Seems to do what it says it would do. Not a glowing endorsement, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it!
B004E2XAFW|4.0|This is a solid effort by WT. I have found few concept albums where the music didn't suffer for the story. Fortunately, this is amongst the exceptions.  I rank this album behind The Heart of Everything and The Silent Force. It is a keeper.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This app rocks. it is super easy to use and has a ton of options. there are different back grounds, tons of writing tool option and much more.

0307891372|4.0|A really nice huge guide filled with alot of useful tips & tricks, a must to have for Skyrim fans :)
B004X80QNG|4.0|Like everyone else has said, this desperately needs a widget. It also needs an in-program way to force a sync with the google server so that you don't have to go to another app. One o other glitch is that the name of the program in the app list is &quot;Informant&quot; not &quot;Pocket Informant,&quot; making it hard to find.  But it accomplishes one thing that Business Calendar and Jorte fall short, which is creating events that do not appear as tentative in Outlook. This is huge. I also like the various layout opinions available. Hopefully they will implement a widget feature soon so that Pocket Informant can take over from Business Calendar (which I use, but do not enjoy) on my home screen.
B00417HV14|5.0|We really love this new DVD of Joe Bonamassa live from Royal Albert Hall. Showcasing all his talents we have replayed it over and over again! Worth the money and would make a great holiday gift!
1932100660|5.0|What is contained in this book is quite astounding and has amazing implications for human health, naturally I am a skeptic and require evidence based support and there is a lot of it here.  Although I am not a statistician and in a position to critique the findings the overwhelming weight and corroborative research put together makes for a very very convincing argument.      It is also easy to read and extremely insightful to the pressures on researchers and big Pharma to maintain the status quo of: essentially us killing ourselves and requiring massive medical and pharmacological intervention to keep us going at huge costs.  well worth anyone reading who is interested in becoming healthier and essentially defeating around half of the most common cancers and diseases by diet alone, although you do have to be a veggie- which I am working on, it has been that persuasive, among many other works I have read.
0439023521|5.0|Ten years ago, I would not have been as enthusiastic about this book, of course, that was before reality TV and the general dumbing down of American society went into full swing. I won't get into too many plot details, but unlike some other reviewers, I bought the premise, hook, line, and sinker.  In the future, young \\"gladiators\\" picked by lottery are sent from twelve poor districts to \\"the Capitol\\" where wealth, greed, and depravity rule. There they fight in the yearly Hunger Games where it's kill or be killed, all televised on live TV; think Survivor, only this is for real. The Capitol keeps it's thumb on the districts with this yearly reminder/punishment of an earlier squelched rebellion decades before. One review I read quibbled that ideas were stolen from the Twilight series, but I don't think there is much comparison.  The Hunger Games greatest merit is the exploration of self-sacrifice for others, even in the shadow of dark times, in this, it has more in common with Harry Potter than Twilight in terms of young-adult books with crossover adult-appeal.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Installation was no problem and it found my location right away. It crashed once when using a Scanner app in background. No problems since. Love this app.
B000H7J9RQ|1.0|I was very disappointed when I could not play the DVD as it was not for our region.  I did not know about the regions.  Why would you ship a DVD that would not play in the U.S.?  It was a big hassle. The US and Canada are region 1, which it did not include.  I would appreciate a reply from you as to why you would do this.  I will think real hard before I ever order again.

B004X80QNG|1.0|Can't even use it like most apps downloaded from Amazon it force closes/crashes at startup. Very disappointed in Amazon and app developers.
B004X80QNG|1.0|Will not install on my HTC Incredible. It does download from Amazon to my phone okay, but crashes on startup.  Tried deleting the app, and reload the program but the results are the same.  Crash!!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|The game itself is great. 1 star for outright ripping people off by charging them for an ad-free app that, lo and behold, still has ads.
B004LSO6YI|5.0|I loved this movie sooo much, I rented it to watch but I'm going to order the DVD when the rental time is up because I want to add this one to my video collection.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|An exciting story. The item arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. I would more than likely buy from this seller in the future.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Otherwise a great app. Fix these shortcomings and you'll finally have a worthy Android port on your hands. While other lesser OSes may not support Widgets...THIS IS ANDROID! ;-)
B003629IPW|5.0|I waited over two years to watch this movie, torn about whether or not Michael would want rehearsal footage to be seen by his fans (he was such a perfectionist with his work). Finally, after missing him so long, I broke down and watched.  It is an amazing look at the tour that would have been and the talent that still pulsed through Michael in his final days.  Seeing all the songs live was an instant mood enhancer, but then remembering that this brilliant artist will not be able to perform again put a tinge of sadness on everything.  Nonetheless, if you are a fan it's a must have for your collection.  It is something I will certainly pull out on rainy days to be moved by the brilliance of MJ.  Special features were a little lame, could have put together more tribute information, but for the price it's a steal!  Don't hesitate.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Not a huge Coldplay fan, but like them well enough. But this album is great. Good mix of songs, and especially like the Coldplay+Rihanna song. Excellent album.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Love this app! Hours of fun! Would be better if it didn't require WiFi to download. I have 4G on my phone, it's a lot faster than WiFi. Heck 3g is too.  I don't have WiFi cause I don't need it.  Have to hunt down a freaking connection just to download. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for that! But otherwise, really fun game, just inconveinient to download.
0060873027|2.0|I was excited about this book for two reasons; the first is that I have always enjoyed Mr. Crichton's fiction. His novels have been slick and well crafted and work in some interesting science and discourse in a seamless way.  With his Libertarian, contrarian tendencies he could infuriate, as in the irresponsible State of Fear, but he nearly always entertained.  His stories often have the narrative drive of popular cinema and I suspect that when he wrote them, he tailored them to translate into commercial films. He was not a literary great but his novels made for some of the best beach and airplane reading.      The second reason I looked forward to Micro is because I have written something similar, a science-fantasy novel, where future humans have evolved to the size of insects and live intertwined in their worlds.  I wanted to see what Mr. Chricton and his post mortem partner Richard Preston would do with their microcosm and the end result is mixed.  My fondness for this kind of world prejudices me to like this novel more than some of its other readers but I understand their disappointment as the story does have some too familiar elements.  Chricton has cannibalized some of his own work and borrowed heavily from others in the essential concept.  When the humans are shrunk, the situation is unintentionally funny and seems to have jumped out of a mediocre comic book or the comedy movie Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.  The jumping off point in which Richard Preston takes over the writing is apparent.  Preston demonstrated extraordinary skills as a writer who can dramatize nature in the terrifying Hot Zone.  Occasional passages in this novel are successful and uneasy to erase from the mind, especially the more violent confrontations between the tiny humans and the arthropods they battle.  Some interesting instruction on nature occasionally glows in these pages, but most of it feels didactic and clumsily inserted.  Passages regarding the creation of curare are overwrought andthe dialogue is fairly flat once Preston takes over - dialogue does not appear to be one of his gifts as a writer.  The too numerous characters are never well established before they are dispatched like the victims of Christie's Ten Little Indians.  The plot is fairly hackneyed and all the antagonist lacks is a whip and a moustache to twirl to distinguish him from an old time melodrama villain.    Besides the Hot Zone, I have also enjoyed Preston's Wild Trees and I think he may have a future in fiction, but this co-effort for a commercial novel does not completely succeed.  I would have been surprised if it had.  Given the circumstances, Preston may have done the very best that any author might have.  But throughout the reading, I wondered how Chricton might have surprised his readers, kept them turning the pages, and if he would have continued a narrative so compelling they would forgive his contrivances and the unscientific nature of the premise.    For those like me who are fascinated with the bug ridden world of Micro, it's something they might want to read and might enjoy but they won't be pushed into any deeper ponderings.

B000000OF6|5.0|After hearing a Queen song sung acapella on \\"Sing-Off\\" I decided I wanted to add a Queen cd to my collection.  This was a great choice.  THere are lots of familiar old Queen songs and some others I had not heard before.  It was a pleasant surprise and the price was right.

B004G8QHKO|4.0|Great music. Was completely shocked by the first 4 songs. Then fell in love. Wanted to be a little more aggressive in the end, seemed to be too romantic. But up to the middle of the disc - gorgeous!

075697237X|5.0|If I could name any one book that had everything I looked for in a good, fascinating read, this would be it.<br /><br />All ugly Tally wants to be is pretty and join her best friend Peris in New Pretty Town. I'll admit, the names just sound silly. Uglies, Pretties,<br />Littlies, New Pretty Town, Rusties, they remind me of something my four year old cousin would say. There's a lot of other slang that takes some getting used to, but don't let it put you off! Uglies is set in a society where everyone has an operation to become pretty by a certain age. Peris has already became pretty and Tally makes one last trip to see him before her operation in 3 months. Uglies and Pretties don't mix, so you can imagine she gets into some trouble which is just the start of her adventure.<br /><br />I like Tally, she's not my favourite character ever, but she's not overly annoying. The only thing that bugs me is her obsession with being pretty. She goes on and on a few times about it, but she's been brainwashed to think anyone who hasn't been made pretty is automatically ugly. I guess I can forgive her for that, because she does, eventually, start to see the world differently.<br /><br />I don't want to go into the story of Uglies, or what Tally gets herself into, but in a nutshell, she has to decide if becoming pretty is worth the price of betraying her friends. I like the adventures she has, I like the cast of characters, I like the setting, basically there's nothing about this book that I dislike. I am really surprised at how gender neutral Uglies is, I was not expecting that and you could say I got a little frustrated with the lack of romance. Westerfeld's writing more than made up for it though.<br /><br />With the ideas presented later in the story, it's almost eerie to think about something like that happening in the future. I definitely recommend this one to anyone.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show. It's absolutely amazing. I preordered and it arrived on the day that it was released, I'm so grateful to have been able to buy this item.

1591844096|5.0|Enjoyed reading Seth Godin's book. While not always agreeing with all of his point, he does make some valid ones about the changes happening in the transition from the Industrial age to the Information age, which many are still refusing to acknowledge.

B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I was skeptical about this app, expecting it to be either weak or difficult to use. This app was both very intuitive and provided a multitude of methods to draw/paint/stamp/etc.  I love it!
B004G606K8|4.0|...but what is?<br /><br />I was skeptical that a worthwhile read could be had from modules designed for a roll playing game. I have similar reservations about movies based on video games. But the present book was recommended by someone whose judgement I trust so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. It was an entertaining and engaging read, one I looked forward to returning to after a busy day. (To me that is the litmus test of a good book.) It is an unabashedly derivative heroic quest fantasy that borrows themes from Tolkien. You have the artifacts of great power. You have a great evil on the rise. You have a company made up of various species and personalities on a quest to oppose it. Etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />But the book has an energy of its own and largely succeeds in blazing its own trail. You have some strong female characters. You have some morally ambiguous characters. Romance, humor, and drama are effectively interwoven.<br /><br />The authors also put interesting original spins on their Tolkienian prototypes. Kenders are the Dragonlance analogue of Tolkien's hobbits and although we only see one, I immediately wanted to know more about them. The gully dwarves are another interesting take. And the stock villainous cannon fodder, the draconians, also do not suffer in comparison to their orc inspiration.<br /><br />The book is written in a style, that while lacking the beauty of Tolkien, is faster paced and probably more accessible to modern readers. Like Tolkien there are passages of poetry but nothing that seriously bogs down the story.<br /><br />My major complaint, and the reason for giving it only one star, is that there is a distinct feeling that the story is being made up as it goes along. Plotting by the seat of your pants can work but here the sharp edges are a little too obvious. The prime example is the return to Solace at the beginning of Book II. It seemed an incredibly foolish thing to do and seemed to serve no other purpose than getting the company captured. Another problem is whereas in Book I the focus is tightly on the eight members of the company, in Book II the company begins to accumulate a whole host of hangers on and the book gets crowded.<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition. Most everything was fine with two exceptions. First, the map was reproduced at a size where it was difficult to make out any detail. Online references helped here. Second, the progress bar only had Book I and Book II marked but not the individual chapters which made the decision to continue reading or not more difficult. But overall I can recommend the Kindle edition.<br /><br />Recommended. I fully intend to complete the trilogy.an getting the company captured.

1451627289|5.0|This extravagantly long novel marks the potential comeback for master storyteller Stephen King, however, it is arguably not his best work yet (The Dark Tower series holds that title; and probably always will). None the less, it is extremely compelling. The premise of the story is simple: Middle-aged English teacher discovers a time portal (the \\"rabbit-hole\\") that leads back to the prime of 1958--however, anyone who has read any work written by Stephen King knows that the plot cannot be this simple. In every novel I've read by King (which encapsulates all of them; excluding maybe three), the plots always interlink, and one of Stephen King's best talents, in my opinion, is his ability to interlink characters from different books to one another; even if by mention or passing-by. 11/22/63 is just another piece of the giant world King has created.   The novel takes some patience getting into; Jake Epping doesn't begin plotting the prevention of the Kennedy assassination and the death of Oswald until about half-way through the novel. Instead, for the first four-hundred pages or so, Jake \\"George Amberson\\" plots to save the Dunning family from their psychopathic father.   I won't give too much away; but after Jake moves to Dallas (Jodie), the story takes a very heart-felt, interesting turn in its dynamic. The characters were three-dimensional, breathing, the first-person narration drove a fast-paced story.   And the ending...the ending is stellar. Slightly predictable, but nonetheless very well done.   I recommend this for anyone looking for an excellently crafted, engrossing work.

B005NF2UE6|5.0|Nickelback's new cd is very good. I had it pre-ordered on amazon and got it the day it came out. I had listened to the songs that were out on the radio and now get to hear the rest of the album. I have been a Nickelback Fan from the begining and one of my favorite songs is Photograph and now When we stand together is right up there. I just love the way it sounds.<br />So if you are having doubts about whether you should buy the whole cd and whether it is worth it stop now because it is worth it and the songs not out there on the radio yet are worth getting listened to also.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie was a great end to the series. I thought that the picture quality was great on just HD and could not tell the difference between the HD and Bu-Ray, so don't waste extra money on the Blu-Ray.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|One episode with hook you, and it's all downhill from there. Walt and Jesse's dance with one another, and with the other characters is superb.  Their transformation, or is it just their base selves coming to the surface, leaves one not willing or able to look away, or to even blink.   We just finished watching Season 3 and must have our Season 4 fix now.  You only thought you were hooked on tv shows.  This is the real deal.
0060873027|1.0|While I was reading this, I kept thinking \\"This can't be Michael Crichton!\\"  Then I realized it was actually the shooting script for a movie of the week for the Syfy Channel.  Then it all made sense - absolutely awful dialogue, really awful one dimensional characters, a plot-line straight from those black and white 1950's era flix with a touch of \\"Game of Thrones\\" kill off the heroes \\"surprises\\". Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one - just wait for the Syfy Channel movie.
B004X80QNG|3.0|seems like an okay app but at roughly 5mb of internal memory used, I had to uninstall it.  if that feature is added in future update, then i'll consider reinstalling it.  since there's apparently no widget, why isn't it moveable to sd??  ...

B005ELQVGW|5.0|I have always really enjoyed Bjork but haven't bought much of her music.  Sometimes it's kind of more of the same (except for the Dancer in the Dark soundtrack, which I LOVE), so I didn't know what to expect.  My opinion of the album is that I really like it.  NPR had a review of the album and explained the different instruments she made special for the music and her inspiration behind the lyrics, which I found very interesting.  It added another element of appreciation for me.  I gave it 5 stars because of the all around product.  If you take the album at face value, that is, without any knowledge of how/why she made it, I would say it should get 4- 4.5.

0061537969|5.0|I knew that Taffy was having health issues and I  tried to evade the reality as much as possibly but instead of reading Marley I decided that the story of Enzo was most fitting.

B004G6009U|5.0|Tangled is of course a considerably embellished and altered version of the Rapunzel tale. The story has its ups and down, and is pretty simple overall, without quite as many twists and turns as even films like \\"The Little Mermaid\\". However, it does have enough body in the plot to interest viewers young and old. It also has both dramatic and humorous sections.<br /><br />Mandy Moore is quite believable as the voice of Rapunzel, and Zacary Levi (Chuck) does a wonderful job as the rogue she becomes involved with. A tavern scene provides wonderful short performances by the likes of Brad Garret and Ron Perlman. Max the animated horse almost steals the show.<br /><br />However, the real achievement of this movie is the gorgeous animation. Scenery is detailed and better than realistic. Faces are emotional and expressive. Action sequences are fluid and exciting, if of course entirely unbelievable. The imagination of the writers and animators was functioning at a very high level in this film. The floating lantern sequence is a truly unique and spectacular piece of film-making that should not be missed. Sequences involving the sun-flower and its latent effects are beautiful.<br /><br />Criticisms that the film sends the wrong message to youngsters concerning Rapunzel's desire to find freedom from her \\"fake mother\\" are ill thought and completely unfounded. She never desired to \\"rebel\\" and \\"seek freedom\\". Something was obviously wrong in the relationship and she could feel that. Being locked up alone for her entire life was a situation it was only natural to wish to correct.<br /><br />This is a fine entry in the history of Disney animated films, and deserves a high placement in that list.

B003TSEL7S|4.0|i picked this book up and i read it and enjoyed it. I didn't change my life in anyway or make me think differently. I it was a good fun read detailed characters and action but it wasn't life vhanging like star wars lord of the rings etc. so i would recomend it but it wouldn't be my first book to recomend to someone.
0439023513|5.0|I have to admit when I finished reading the end of the trilogy, I felt like my heart was emptied, I felt depressed and not complete. The entire story line wraps around the revolution, war, losses and relationships being destroyed. It reminded me of the Soviet times I grew up in, with dictatorship, lack of freedom, food and simple necessities. But what I was really hoping is that the author would add some \\"dandelion in a spring\\" and will burst some light into the darkness of the third book. That didn't happen much. It seemed to me that the end was rushed and the book didn't give an opportunity to the reader to sink in with all the emotions.  However,I would still give rave reviews for the trilogy, please read it!! I was just hoping to see a more elaborate ending.
B005EVVESM|4.0|Lots of music to make you want to MOVE! Have already been asked about the song \\"Move Like Jagger\\" and which Maroon 5 CD is it recorded on.
B00479SVBU|5.0|The Satechi Soundfly broadcasts a strong signal to the car's FM radio.  The sound quality is very good, plus it is convenient to leave the Soundfly plugged into the car and simply transfer mp3s onto a jump drive or camera card and load it into the device.  The only drawback is you must manually bookmark where you are in a file (by pressing a button) before you power down or you will go back to the beginning of that track when you start up again. Still, for the price (a good quality FM transmitter + mp3 player) it's a great purchase.  Highly recommended.
0143038095|1.0|I needed to read this for school.... I hated every second of it especially because the book requires you to really over think it to string everything together. By far the worst book I've read.
B005URRCNQ|1.0|I know the fans that have been around since the start are saying the same thing. Don't get me wrong, if I was in a band and my record label and manager said \\"Hey, we will pay you a ton of money if you compose an album that the stupid tweens will love!!!\\" sure I would let down my true fans for that. WRONG. That's the one thing I thought The Black Keys would never do, but I was wrong. Once I heard their songs all over t.v. and movies I knew it was coming. Now they just sound like everybody else on the radio. The money got to their heads.  These songs are meant for the new fans they've picked up in the past 2 years. They sound nothing like what they used to. Unless they bring it on home on the next album, I will not be a fan of the new Black Keys. If your an old fan or have good taste in music just don't bother buying it.  And to all those that are going to try to and lash out at me in comments, Good Luck.
B004X80QNG|1.0|on kindle fire it doesn't sync with google calendar, only task manager. tries to install on my Droid 2 to see if functionality was different than on Kindle Fire. on my Froissart it just crashes as soon as installation is complete. this app is worthless
B004X80QNG|5.0|I almost didn't grab this based on the about it not syncing with Google Calendar, but I hate to not grab an app with such a loyal following on other platforms, knowing that it may improve as it matures on Android. I can say that on my Galaxy Tab 10.1 it synced immediately with Google. I really like the way it customizes and the layout.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I love this movie and I finally upgrade from a tape version.  The picture is wonderful and the story is still great.
B005URRCUY|3.0|So before release I kept hearing about how \\"heavy\\" this album was going to be, so I decided to give it an ear during my workout today. It's definitely not heavy, maybe thick, but mostly just \\"upbeat\\", and shorter than expected. I am not one who screws around in the gym, and yet I was able to play the album twice from beginning to end before I was done.   I have to admit I wasn't very focused on the lyrical content of the album, but the first thing I noticed is that every (E-VE-RY) single chorus is done with what sounds like a backup group of singers. No I'm wrong, \\"Money Maker\\" is a lone exception. The whole thing seems to empathize with Auerbach's subject, as though he is saying \\"Damn, woman, you're cold but you sure are a lot of fun!\\" Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just doesn't speak much to the blues that built the foundation of this band and hooked me years ago. There just isn't any animosity or pain or any other emotion coming through, and the album feels very gregarious and not intimate at all - like group sex. I should probably sit down with it and give it a more proper listen, but I don't really care to tonight.  I can't say it's a bad record, but I don't see it leaving a lasting impression on anyone, least of all any long-time Black Keys fan.
B0060ZJ74O|2.0|Took forever to sign up for two different services (UltraViolet and Flixster) that are mandatory to get the digital copy, and found out in the end that it won't play on my iPod Touch.  Very fine print only on the web site says it works only on iPod's with 3G or 4G service.  I watch my movies on airplanes and streaming certainly doesn't work there.  I've got way too many digital services already and I certainly don't want or need these.  Amazon and iTunes is plenty for me already.    If they are going to go this route, then just sell me a Blu-Ray, DVD set and leave the faux digital copy off.  I'm not going to pay for it.

1400052181|5.0|I read this book for book club and had a hard time putting it down.  The author did an excellent job of researching the material and of building a strong relationship with the family over a long period of time.  Before starting, I knew nothing about HeLa cells and certainly had no idea that one strain of cells alone could be used so extensively in research and for so many conditions.    It also reads like a history novel in that it describes the medical conditions, the lab research facilities as well as the sad way African Americans were treated during the 40s and 50s.  I highly recommend this book to men and women, who enjoy a good book and who like to learn through reading.
0062060554|2.0|Thought this would be a great read for the weekend, but I was wrong. I do like the concept, but i felt the author lost what could of been great. If you still want to read this book I recommend you borrow it from your library and not waste your hard earn money.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Cute drawing app, but tools and colors are limited. I think an option to set color by hex code would have rocked 5 stars. Before you judge, I did scroll through to see the full palette and the different brushes, pens, etc.
1451648537|5.0|This book provided a compelling but realistic view of one of the greatest innovators of our time, Steve Jobs.  It was inspirational in that he was driven to succeed by the very thought of his own demise.  We should all strive to live life so fiercely and we should approach all things in our life with the same sort of dire passion.  This book provided a humanistic view that people don't often see in a CEO but they are just like the rest of us but driven by a force few will understand.  I was indeed captivated by his story because in a lot of regards his life parallels my own.  It gave me a fresh pespective and I appreciated that.  This is a book I highly recommend.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|One of the only remakes that is actually worth watching.  Great scenes of Venice, witty, funny and enjoyable film. A must see.

B005RYF5JA|4.0|Having just watched the new show on PBS, I must say I am less than thrilled with the song selection.  There were some good ones which I enjoyed immensely but there were far too many new ones which I did not particularly like.  I guess I am just old fashioned.  I do have some concerns however.  It has already been stated that Lisa Kelly will not be in the show when it goes on tour next year.  She will be extremely difficult to replace.  I am a great Celtic Woman fan and  have already purchased my tickets for the Memphis tour next Spring, but after seeing the latest  show, I am not as excited as I once was.  I have  now received my DVD copy and after playing it several times would like to add the following comments to my original review.  As usual, the ladies are absolutely beautiful. The costumes, staging and sets were stunning but I am still not pleased with some of the songs.  However, there are enough good ones to make up for the ones I do not like.  I found the quality of the DVD to be vastly improved over previous ones and am very thankful for that.  Now, I will probably start a controversy with my next comment.  The drummers are extremely talented and their contibutions to the show's overall performance are immense.  However, why must the audience be subjected to black, hairy armpits throughout the show?  One wears a short sleeved garment and is presentable.  The other does not and at times his appearance is less than desirable.  He could wear short sleeves too and yet not hinder his performance?
B0000AK7AB|5.0|Babe is a great family movie! Enjoyable and full of barnyard humor! A great movie to watch when you need a \\"pick me up\\" and want to laugh! There is also an underlying theme present that is a good morale to this story.
B00506NRBS|5.0|There are some great words of wisdom in this little book and I highly recommend it for anybody interested in business and/or living a rich, meaningful life! Great read!
1451648537|5.0|Excellent book combining both the life of Steve Jobs and the evolution of Apple and its products.  Both are intertwined so much and the mental, emotional, and physical aspects of Jobs' life reflect the culture of Apple as a business. Should be required reading for business majors, CEOs and behavior therapists as well as Apple, music, video and techie fans.
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|Hi, am I missing something?  Something must be wrong.  How is there only one review for a Bob Dylan album?  Makes no sense.  But nothing in the world makes sense these days.  Okay, I'll be number two.  It takes two, babe.  this is one of the all-time best cds ever.  First of all, every song rocks.  Second of all, Mark Knopfler takes his  \\"Espresso Love\\" era guitar chops and  ratatatats all over every track.  No one's left standing.  Third of all Dylan wrote these lyrics right  after Israel blew up an Iraqi bomb factory  that claimed to be making baby formula.   That was before it became hip to destroy Iraq.  Fourth of all, this album was recorded totally  on computers, no tape.  It is clean, clean, clean.  Fifth of all, with the proceeds from this cd, Dylan  was able to add a deck to his house in Malibu;  and a hot tub.  Well, you know what they say, some people will  rob you with a six-shooter; others with a fountain pen.  The End

B004LWZW7E|2.0|So I was watching this movie, the trailer gave me high hopes because the whole general idea of using time as the future currency is actually interesting because as we all know it, time is money. So this movie is an interpretation of that phrase. Now the two main actors of the movie shown in the cover art (Justin Timberlake) as Will Salas and (Amanda Seyfield) as Sylvia Weis are decent actors, but that's about as far as it'll go. Just enough to move the movie along but nothing beyond that.   Anyhow, I'll just go straight to the point. The movie was interesting, but throughout the movie, there was a lingering sensation of regret. One of the biggest hint of a failing movie that I seem to be getting more and more often which signifies a decaying American movie industry is the ever nagging thought \\"this had so much potential\\" , \\"this movie could have been really great if...\\" , \\"what a waste of such an interesting subject for a movie...\\".   To me, if the viewer, in this case myself, feels this way throughout the movie, it just means the movie is lacking. Enough for me to not consider a rewatch ever again. The cleverness of time is money and money is time ends right where the period ends this sentence. The acting wasn't great, the movie felt a bit rushed, the story was weak and felt emotionless. So much potential in drama and action, but cut severely short, crippling the movie. This is an OK watch, but not worth the theater ticket price.   1-10, I give this a 5.6  It's not a HORRIFIC movie since there's no unsubtle movie crippling flaws. It's entertaining, but only if you have nothing of higher quality to watch.

0470876417|5.0|I was required to buy this one for my Venture Creation class in my 2 year MBA. This book - and the class - is one of the BEST books I read so far.  It provides new concepts in business and different business models and gives a new perspective and way to look at different business. And the best part is that it's very straightforward and focuses on the important thing WITH VISUAL. So you get the concept and the core idea right away, without reading pages after pages wondering what the point the writer is trying to say. It also uses many different companies from traditional, e-commerce, retail, social media etc. to illustrate the different business model.     Plus, it also demonstrates how we should re-evaluate the business model after the changes in the markets, trends etc. to adapt to the evolution of the market, industry, economy, consumers / customers...  I come back to read it every now and then and always enjoy reading it still.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I just got my schade extreme and i just love it!! i love the way it looks. it feels really nice in my hand. and im very happy with this knife. i dont know why anyone would rate this knife 1 star. i think this knife will hold up very well. plus u can not go wrong with the price. im glad i got this knife. it took me a long time to even think about buying it but after i watched many reviews of it on youtube then it just sucked me into getting the knife. i have no imperfections on this knife so far. as of some ppl did. but the handle if good and fits my hand very well. blade is very sharp and nice. cant wait to go put it to the test. if u are looking to get this knife just get it. it would make a good gift.im very happy with the schrade extreme schf9.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Outside of 36 Chambers.. Liquid Swords is the best Wu album to date.  This album plays like one song.  Every cut flows perfectly into the next.  The beats are classic and so are the verses, this is a must own.
B005VR9328|5.0|I've been listening to the Roots since '96 and have watched them grow musically with every album. Every artist has to grow and stretch or they will be left behind. No, this isn't \\"Things Fall Apart\\", but just as good for different reasons.  I wondered if they could top \\"How I got Over\\", and from a conceptual/artistic standpoint I think they did. The Roots are always going to make good music, so at this point they're getting creative with their writing and how they compose the album. You have to listen all the way through to really appreciate the storyline within the album. It's not just a compilation of tracks, but a story with highs and lows. So good.

B003EYVXYG|3.0|This is quite gory, as one would expect a film about zombies to be, but at least it has some humor here and there to give the viewer a break.  On a small island, a stubborn man is trying to train the zombies to eat something other than human flesh and perhaps even to be useful in some way.  His longtime rival has other ideas, and then a small group of soldiers comes along into the fray.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I'm one of the types that likes to give the free apps that Amazon offers a shot, even if I'm not planning to use them- after all, you never know what an app has to offer until you try it out yourself. :)  This app is one of the better organization apps that I've seen, and is a great alternative for those who are not satisfied with the built in calendar app on their droid. Don't listen to the misinformation in the 1 and 2 star review section; you can fix the issues they bring up by simply messing with the app and/or going into settings and physically changing the issue yourself.  I don't have a use for it since I'm perfectly happy with the pre-installed android calendar, but if you need a little more capability then this app is for you. :)
B005HP2J66|4.0|Werner Herzog enters the Chauvet Cave in France which had been sealed for more than 30K years and finds amazing wall paintings, among other discoveries, as he and his crew explore the 1300-foot cave.  The artistry is well preserved, as are the calcite formations around some animal and human skulls.  This might be a bit slow or dull for those who are not into the archaeology and paleontology.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|When I saw this for the first time, I wasn't expecting much. Then I was transported to another plane, another time and never wanted the movie to end. loving The Beatles wonderful songs, as one does, this was a great interpretation done by a generation who weren't even born in the days of The Beatles. The music alone sands on it's own. The incredible chilling rendition of \\"Let It Be\\" will move you to tears. Now, the visuals! Julie and her team I extend my highest regard for after what I consider more \\"a happening\\" (kids, that's an event)than watching a film. With total visual as well as cast surprises around every corner! This movie in many ways harkens back to the days of the big change in Hollywood with such production companies as \\"BBS\\", in particular to the movie \\"HEAD\\" (starring The Monkees), although was panned by critics, today is loved by those same critics as groundbreaking cinematography!! It has become a cult classic and is the only film I can categorize with \\"Across The Universe\\".  In no short way, this move takes it into the 21st century with visuals of what one would see on halucinatives, while drinking Iced Tea, or any favorite beverage for that matter! It's is a splendid film, and I hate to even call it JUST a film! Experience it the way it should be seen and heard, in high def blu ray, with a nice loud sound sound system. Economically affordable for homes today! Sit back, no need to pass the smoke, just don't blink and get ready for the roller coaster trip of a lifetime! JULIE,JULIE...I bow to you!

B004ZNARH4|5.0|The work that went into the creation of this \\"Collector's Piece\\" is astounding! I believe the first version I had was 8-track, then, a crappy sounding LP. Then finally a digital mix on CD which was a 5th generation, hissy sounding digital disc came out. All the rumors that the Japanese CD was better sounding was bull. In 2003 came the mighty SACD mix and wow! Now it comes down to how much a fan you are of Pink Floyd, your financial situation..and if those are two pluses, this set is a treat for both eyes and ears! OK, James Guthrie remastered the album again. Sounds nice. What I wanted most was the original 1972 version of the album! If you love the greatest and longest charting rock record in history, you will crap when you here this early '72 Alan Parsons take on the album. Surprisingly, the sound is better than I imagined! It rivals the final '73 mix! Then you get the rare quad mix that has been lost for 30 years! That is unreal. You are surrounded by the album and hear things you never heard before. The Blu Ray is astounding! A section for audio and a section for video, that if you are watching a blu ray, it is assumed you have a nice way to screen the background films that varied from '73-75 on one of the longest tours for any album. They isolated certain sounds for the viewing of all 3 back stage films so you never get bored with the audio. This is not a \\"one day\\" box. There is the concert on blu ray from that massive tour and if you know how The Floyd is live, especially Roger Waters, it is so perfect, you swear the album is playing!  Some varied vocals but wow! I could have done without the marbles but it's just a collector's piece remember. It's to symbolize \\"we are all mad and could use a set of marbles!\\" They are crafted beautifully! The coasters...blaaaa..The collector cards are nice, The hand written letter in Rogers actual pen as he wrote it is like having a piece of history. Then there are replicas of a back stage pass and a ticket stub. Each nicely tucked in black envelopes. A massive book with the lyrics and all the variations that were done on the album art on thick glossy paper. Another book with cameo shots of them on tour. The ONLY disappointment is they didn't include the 2 LP vinyl which was cut at 45 RPM straight from the master tapes. Will I buy it anyway? You bet your ass because this album opened my mind to a new world! I will cherish this piece as the collectible it is. There is even a paper warning that kids should not buy this because it is not a toy! COLLECTOR'S Only! That's me!

B005NKIQ26|5.0|Definitely not your usual Justin Bieber groupie, I heard Justin's first holiday tune 'Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas' on AOL Radio and decided, right then and there, to order this CD.  Always on the look out for innovative, upbeat interpretations on holiday classics, Justin's fresh, clear tone versions are not only fun to listen to, but engaging.      The BIG surprise of the holiday is that I absolutely loved this CD.  I'm a picky,  musically enlightened 60 year old who enjoys finger-snappin, toe-tappin' qualities in song and dance.  This CD promises to elicit bouncy, rhythmic pop tunes that entices one to karoake-out or get up and move.  Young Justin seems incredibly comfortable and composed singing with featured artists; from Usher to Mariah Carey, his chameleon like voice seems to meld beautifully with the various performers that accompany him.  And what's more? There are bold surprises in the mix. The unexpected rendition of 'Drummer Boy' featured with Busta Rhymes will have you up on your feet movin' and groovin' to a song you never thought would encourage snappin' and tappin'.  It reminded me of Michael Jackson's driving anthem, 'They Don't Really Care About Us'; definitely, a different spin on a classic.   'All I Want For Christmas Is You' is a happy, festive take on the song originally attributed to the movie hit, 'Love Actually'. Additionally, there's a Justin-spin on a country pop tune featuring The Band Perry that is both charming and holiday-spirited.    There are several songs that feature Justin at his melodic, pure-tone best that boast cool, up beat pop tunes.  However, the song that truly astonished me for its engaging, poignant rendition of a holiday classic was Justin's last featured song, 'Silent Night'; his version will startle you in its simplicity, if not touch a soft spot in your heart.  This CD, in my mind, has it all; from pop to R&B to new country, Justin, Usher, Boyz II Men, Mariah, Busta Rhymes and Band Perry have successfully contributed to the creation of an enjoyable, 'young at heart' 2011 holiday CD. Well done!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|Love this album. Favorite album this year. There is so much trash out there in radio land. This is a breath of fresh air. It just seems genuine and honest. The dude hits alot of bases, musically. Like some other listeners, i also loved it the more I listened to it. Yeah, there are a couple tracks that are just fillers, but it doesn't take anything away from the whole album. KILLYOUR HEROS is probably the weakest track for me, but the others are fantastic! Just a great feeling to this album. K, I'm done...just get it and enjoy.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I spent many an hour deciding which knife to purchase for general camp chores and finally decided on this one because of the reviews and reasoanble price.  I looked at ESEE, Ontario (I already had the RTAK 2) and several other makes including Busse.  This knife is as good or better than these other knives which may be more flashy or glamerous but that is not why I bough this knife.  I bought it as a tool...not a show piece.  It wil do anything you ask a knife to do and is as solid as billet steel.  You will not regret purchasing this knife upon which you can bank your life!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this everyday one my kindle fire and love it! The timer is great and will help me at work.

I have alarms set all day... to wake up my son for school, to start closing up for the day and even to go to bed. No joke. Anything to keep me from clock watching is a plus for me! The features on this clock are great. You will love this, too.
0553278398|4.0|As a science fiction writer Isaac Asimov (1920-92) is noted primarily for his Robot novels and the Foundation series. The subject of these comments is the Bantam Audiocassette production of \\"Prelude to Foundation\\". This 1989 audio book consist of two audiocassettes with a length of 3 hours. The reader is David Dukes who does a commendable job when you consider he must alter his voice to represent about 12 characters. There is no mention if this production is an abridgement and if so did the author approve.<br /><br />  For the record author Asimov wrote three \\"Foundation\\" novels is the early 1950's. I know I read one of the books in 1960's since I still have it on my shelf. (It was titled \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" with a note on the cover \\"former title Foundation\\".)  Much later Asimov wrote four additional \\"Foundation\\" books in 1982, 1986, and 1988 and one published posthumously in 1993.<br /><br />  The events detailed in \\"Prelude to Foundation\\" occurred prior to \\"Foundation\\" the first book in the series published in 1951. How Asimov kept all the characters, dates, events and ideas in sequence over 40 plus years is just another indication of what a genius this man was.

1591840562|3.0|This is the first book I have read by Guy Kawasaki and, while I wasn't blown away, I definitely found some value.  If nothing else, the book appealed to my brand of humor.  Guy has a way of bringing levity to the perpetually dull \\"business book\\" genre.  He has an occasional in-paragraph quip and, even better, are the regular footnotes that are easily missed but worth a look.  He provides quite a few excellent tips on many aspects of starting a business - presentations, funding, hiring, managing, etc.  For the most part, it's written with a bit of an instruction list feel, although it's not overdone.  For example, Guy reminds you to write a business plan with the right intentions in mind - that is, don't expect a business plan itself to win over an investor.  Its job is to solidify your financial projections and detail your assumptions after a successful pitch.  The largest gripe I had with the book started around Chapter 9.  Up until that point, each chapter was well articulated, had enough content, and held meaning.  Chapter 9 and beyond felt a bit contrived and not as well thought out.  It wasn't a total waste - it just seemed as though Guy had eight solid chapters and decided the book wasn't long enough, so he slapped on a few more in haste.  Overall, I liked it and it had good information.  If I start my own business, I WILL refer back to this book.

1427208980|5.0|The premise of this book is that while technology and knowledge march forward at an astonishing pace, the human brain is not able manage the vast amount of information that has come with it.  No matter how expert or specialized we each may become, in many occupations, a single lapse of memory can lead to catastrophe.  Gawande's simple solution is to handle that complexity with checklists.  Specifically, his checklists are defined to be short reminders of steps to be performed without detailing every minute detail.  It's elegant and useful - and unfortunately, something I've seen violated numerous times throughout documentation I've read.  Put simply, the people using checklists are assumed to already be experts in their field.  A pilot taxiing to a runway has already been through significant training and could almost certainly get the plane in the air without a checklist.  But the presence of the checklist makes sure that EVERY pilot on EVERY flight can get the plan in the air safely, regardless of distractions, weather, etc.  Checklists lead to repeatable success in the hands of the expert.  They are not an instruction manual.  This book was pretty influential for me.  I feel like I've made good use of it in my work and have found it successful.  Creating a checklist sounds like child's play, yet Gawande shows that it's a bit of an art form.  If nothing else, after reading this book, you'll have a new-found appreciation for the complexity of the medical profession.
B004EPYZSK|1.0|The only thing original in this film is the title and premise, which  everyone does their best to bring down to earth and deflate in the most unoriginal way possible.  Badly designed and executed. Aliens lassoing from spaceships???? Huh?????? Old chestnut of the cattle baron with the spoiled,rotten son. Watch the Searchers or Meek's Cutoff , not  star drek like this. What a shame, all the toys and no imagination to play with them. I wish i could give this minus 6 stars.
0321704452|5.0|Surprisingly, The Naked Presenter provides a calming experience as you read through its pages.  Other reviewers referred to the text as Zen-like and, prior to reading, I would have found that description laughable.  But, after having read the book, I completely agree.  Garr Reynolds somehow manages to provide useful dos and don'ts in a tranquil, calming environment as you read.  The pictures, periodic speaker interviews, and references to Japanese culture all contribute to lulling you into learning.  Obviously, his techniques will not work for everyone.  But, as I worked my way through the chapters, I was convinced that the \\"less is more\\" philosophy was effective.  I have attempted to put it to use and actually found it a bit liberating.  In an office environment, people feel compelled pair their presentation with PowerPoint.  All too often, it's over-baked in some way or another, leading to a distracting presentation.    Sometimes, the book repeats itself somewhat, but for the most part the information is solid and clear.  It even manages to deliver a life lesson or two.  It's an appropriate title and the content is relevant.  I would recommend it.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I thought it would be better. Most reviewers complained about syncing issues but I didn't care about that. I had some force close issues when changing daily and weekly views. I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the highlighted work times, even though I unchecked all the boxes. Overall the app is over complicated and not as polished as it should be for the price. Sometimes less is more. Droid 1 running CM7.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|This set Bluray DVD is not 16:9. The vedios don't look like Bluray quality at all. The only difference between this set and the regular DVD set is that you can play them on your Bluray player. Just don't expect true Bluray quality, though.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|My family just finished watching It's A Wonderful Life in the colorized version, and we really enjoyed it.If we didn't know better, we would have thought the move was originally made in color. It's was so beautiful, and you really can see the tinest of details. Since it's a two disc set, we'll also watch the B&W version, since thats how it was when we first watched the movie.
0439023491|5.0|Another excellent read by Suzanne Collins. Like the first book, I couldn't put it down! Katniss and Peeta were victorious in defeating all the other districts' tributes, and it seems that their stunt with the berries doesn't go unnoticed by either the Capitol or the people. Its being seen as an act of rebellion and the cause of uprising from other districts. Katniss is then sent into the arena again to battle the other remaining victors of previous Hunger Games.<br /><br />Sequels are usually hard for me to like as much as the first book, but there are some exceptions (Harry Potter, The Fever series, and now The Hunger Games). I think that this one may be a bit more difficult to read than the first for the younger audience (it is a young adult novel, after all) because its dealing more with government uprising as well as the killings.

1400049628|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my 16 yr old son and he has read it cover to cover several times. Beginning with fictional scenarios and myths throughout history, this book chronicles everything from the origins of the \\"zombie-creating\\" virus to what to do in the event of a world wide takeover. Worried about the next zombie invasion or apocolypse? Never fear...this book has the answer to every question one could possibly imagine to survive the walking dead. From weapons to use, supplies to stockpile, and escape scenarios for the most inexperienced human, this book has basically everything you need to survive gooey, reanimated, brain-munching monsters. Not up to date on The Walking Dead series? No problem! This book will cover it all. A must have for the zombie obsessed person in your life.

B0062KJ1Q6|1.0|a waste of bandwidth,time and money  poor acting, lots of foul language does not a good movie make!!!  30 minutes or less??? mostly less
B005KCGIUY|5.0|MJK and friends have really come through again on this release. I really stress the 'friends' aspect because while I have always been a fan of anything MJK has done (except for maybe the Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty), much credit must be given to the other contributors to this record. In all, they have created a body of work that exemplifies simplicity and a delicate attention to the lost art of the evolving song structure. This album has the power to make you laugh one minute and say 'woah' the next - a concept I find to be very similar to how life plays out itself.  Anyone who would shun this project because it doesn't sound like Tool should stick to only listening to Shinedown, because they simply don't understand music or the mindset of MJK. The ability for one man to cross so many genres and still create compelling and beautiful music is something we may not see for a long time. Here's to hoping that MJK doesn't decide to kick off his boots 'n spurs any time soon.  Notable tracks:  Monsoons  Conditions of My Parole  The Weaver

B004EPYZSU|4.0|Let's get this straight right from the start: I cannot possibly write an unbiased review of this movie.  I was raised in the 90's, the son of parents raised in the 50's and 60's.  James Bond, STAR WARS, and Indiana Jones were instilled in me at an early age, as were the great sci-fi and western flicks of yesterday.  COWBOYS & ALIENS is basically the summation of all of my childhood fantasies.  Possibly, this applies to you as well.  If so, you'll know exactly where I'm coming from.<br /><br />But if it doesn't...well, you may still be in for a treat.  John Favreau pulls a few punches, but you don't really notice.  The film revolves around Jake Lonergan, a wanted criminal who awakes in the desert with no knowledge of who he is (when asked what he knows, he stoically replies: \\"English\\").  In town, Lonergan has a run-in with Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), a spoiled rich boy who loves to shoot his guns off.  Percy's ex-Confederate daddy (Ford) comes riding into town, with a bone to pick with Lonergan.  Unfortunately, a few aliens intervene, kidnapping some townsfolk, and the two foes must join forces to save the day.<br /><br />Make no mistake: cliches abound.  Favreau and company (there are eight credited screenwriters, not to mention the comic's creator) hit every major Western point; co-producer Ron Howard, in the bonus features, actually comments on how a good western strikes all of the major chords, which I would disagree with, but his fat wallet speaks louder than my empty checking account, so go figure.  (On a side note, it's interesting to hear John Favreau say that STAR WARS borrowed from western iconography; definitely gives some food for thought.)  Usually, cliches are a hindrance; when you're watching a film such as COWBOYS & ALIENS, you kind of expect them, and as such are willing to say, \\"Okay, well, I saw this coming, so I can't complain much.\\"  That's not to say they're completely unnoticeable (note the lack of a star), but this is still a fun ride.<br /><br />This film has two stars: the special effects and the actors.  The effects are great; nothing ground-breaking, but this film isn't meant to be.  It's just fun.  The aliens are freaky and interesting; the explosions are cool; the violence is surprisingly gory in spots (almost detrimentally so, but not quite).  The film's greatest strength, however, lies in its actors; Favreau has dotted his film with a bunch of talented character actors.  Daniel Craig has done this thing many times before, which simply means he's damn good at it: he's got the tough-guy wit down pat, and adds a bit of an emotional touch where required (Craig is, after all, one of the best actors on the scene right now, make no mistake).  Harrison Ford, too, has carved his niche, though he gets to push past this in a couple scenes: for a little while, you're actually afraid of him, as his character isn't necessarily a nice guy.  He's grossly underused, however; this is Craig's vehicle, not Ford's.  The same goes for Olivia Wilde; her character is interesting (if predictable), and the actress is clearly up for a challenge, but she never gets to do much.  The supporting cast features Sam Rockwell as a bartender/doctor bent on rescuing his wife; Clancy Brown as a tough-as-nails preacher; Keith Carradine as a kind-but-tough sheriff; and an especially-good Paul Dano as the younger Dolarhyde.<br /><br />There are too many subplots that never get fully expanded; a whole lot of cliches that you see coming a mile away, and make no sense even within the context of the film; and everything runs on a bit too long.  But that's all okay.  Why?  Because COWBOYS & ALIENS is one of the few honest films to come out in recent years.  Check out its title: that's exactly what you get.  It's fun, plain and simple.  It won't win awards, and it doesn't deserve any.  It's meant to entertain, it's meant to excite the fanboy in you, and by God, it does that job admirably.the special effects and the actors.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|I made this purchase from an in-store large retailer for fear of possible knock-offs (it was on sale for $24).  With that said, I'm 6ft 1inches and slim.  My play space is approx 7ft 2inches and then I hit my couch.  I also have the issue with width (approx 5ft 6inches, only a problem when 2 people want to play).  My biggest issue was when playing Zumba or Dance Central 2, anything with arms straight up my kinect would not see, it it sitting under my wall mounted flat screen approx 4ft off the floor.  I didnt want to buy a tv mount to put it on top because i dont like the look and there was concern it wouldnt see my feet, plus i have some shorter friends.  With the details out of the way, I read almost all 125+ reviews on here before purchasing to find the common issues based on setup and then just didnt do those things & my unit works as intended.         #1 I mounted my Kinect below the TV (still approx 4' off the floor).  And connected this accessory while the xbox was off.    #2  The Zoom holes ARE larger than the Kinect lenses, (like the zoom directions state) when you look at the middle lens you should see the center of the Kinect lens in the center of the circle.  If its not, you need to move the Zoom over (adjust).  **Note: this is where zoom lost a star.  Sccrraaattttccchhhh. even when you remove the zoom as recommended, it scratches the glossy finish on the Kinect.  If you have an issue of a black ring showing on your camera once its turned on (like some other reviewers) then your zoom isnt placed correctly.      #3 I did NOT just enter setup and re-calibrate.  I went into \\"initial setup\\" and \\"set up my console\\" (location, date, blah blah) and most importantly KINECT.  You know where it makes you listen to the sounds, and stand in the circle and wave,  That sets the room lighting and gets the best reading of \\"you,\\" calibration is just fine tweaking.        #4  While in initial setup I noticed the kinect seemed jumpy & didnt follow my hand motions as smoothly as I was used to.  That freaked me out a bit.  The setup took waay longer than i remember, i felt like I was waving for 5min. finally i took a 1/2 step back (even though it initially said i was in the middle of the circle) and boom everything worked perfect.    #5 I ran calibration just in case  Now everything is up and running and I only have to stand 5ft from my tv and kinect can see my whole body, and tracks my moves perfectly.  A friend brought over child of something...it wasnt really my cup of tea (though the music was decent) I dont think i understood the point.  I was just glad he was able to play it without me having to move out of the way.  He said the movements were pretty accurate, im sure i would have heard some choice words if they weren't.

B002ZG9846|4.0|Somehow I missed both the previews and the film when it came out, but liked the poster (and fantasy/adventure in general), and the reviews were generally favorable, and the comments by Chloë Grace Moretz added to the appeal. I wasn't sure what to expect-- thought it might be in the same line as Mystery Men, and, while it was, the start began innocently, making me wonder why Chloë cautioned against letting children see it, but then, she made her entrance, and obvious became an understatement.  Typical nerd-finds-girl, turns-hero, wins-girl plot (a la Spiderman, etc) and all the characters are likeable and the action is fairly evenly paced. No-one is a moron, events are logical. A good time. Much violence. Grab the popcorn!
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|I've been a long time Oasis fan and when the band called it quits, I had to check out their solo efforts. TBH, I wasn't that impressed with what Beady Eye put out. It did not sound like the very best of Oasis (remember WTSMG / Masterplan..?). Well Noel has created a truly amazing album. I can't find one average sounding track here. Everything in here is well thought out - interesting melodies, reflective lyrics. After the very first listen, I was hooked. There are so many gems here: The death of you and me, shine a light on me, soldier boys, stop the clocks..  Overall, this pleasantly surprised me and far exceeded my expectations. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that I would easily put this among the best of Oasis albums! This is what Oasis should have put out next! Noel, whatever you do, please don't stop making great music like this!
B005J7K964|5.0|At last! Years ago I owned this version of Metropolis on Laserdisc; I've waited a LONG time for it to appear on Blu-ray. This new version looks and sounds identical to the superb Laserdisc version.<br /><br />There are several versions of this amazing classic movie available; I like the musical background on this one. But I actually had a B&N salesman try to steer me away from this version because he hated the music. Whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />If nothing else, Metropolis is worth watching just for the evil art deco robot. This amazing design was created in 1927 and hasn't been matched to this day. It makes R2D2, C3PO and the Terminator look like they were cobbled together by high school kids!

B002XTXG1G|4.0|Charles Bronson (born in Aberystwith as Mickey Peterson) was (is) one of Britain's most notorious prisoners, by dint of being one of its most violent incarcerates. I believe that the fellow has spent some 30y in nick (transferred from one institution to the next as his welcome wore out) most of which time was done in solitary.<br /><br />The film portrays this unsavoury character as a caricature, often breaking the fourth wall and playing him directly to the viewer (and even, wearing whiteface, to a fictitious, on-screen audience). This may seem odd and off the wall, but from what little I know of the real Charles Bronson, he was (is) a larger than life show-man, an overdone self-caricature so, in many ways the film may not be far from the truth in its depiction of the man. It is certainly uneasy viewing and I found myself liking the guy for his eccentricities, forgetting the real reason for his notoriety. Of course this is soon (and frequently) rectified as the film doesn't shy away from his nastier tendencies and the violence, itself almost stylised, comes thick, fast and extreme.<br /><br />The film is certainly dominated by Tom Hardy's spellbindingly excellent depiction of a dangerously unstable and hugely unpredictable, yet deeply charming thug. Hardy clearly threw himself into the role with some brio and he conveys this strange mixture of attributes cerebrally AND athletically. The remainder of the cast is very much scenery dressing although, to be fair, their personalities are rather overshadowed by the larger-than-life central character.<br /><br />In the end, although it makes no attempt to excuse Bronson of his faults, the film does rather appear to skirt around the edges of glorifying his violent behaviour and an impressionable viewer could come away from the film thinking of the man as a bit of an anti-hero. \\"You're pitiful\\", Bronson's prison governor says to him and it's hard to disagree that any man who, pretty much out of choice, spent the majority of his life behind bars IS pitiful.<br /><br />An interesting, disturbing semi-fictional biopic of an interesting, disturbed and (probably) semi-fictional character.<br /><br />Recommended, but approach with caution, especially as you get to see rather more of Mr Hardy's \\"old chap\\" than is perhaps savoury before the watershed (or after it, for that matter)...ul.  An interesting, disturbing semi-fictional biopic of an interesting, disturbed and (probably) semi-fictional character.

1451627289|4.0|Jake Epping discovers a time-portal which allows him to travel back to the late 50's. His plan? Prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK and save the world for western democracy. Unfortunately, he hasn't fully grasped the meaning of the \\"law of unintended consequences\\" and when he returns to the present day he discovers that things haven't quite turned out for the best.<br /><br />Let me first ask a question... What in God's name was he thinking? Jake is a high-school English teacher. An educated, intelligent man. A Westerner. He undoubtedly HAS heard of the law of UC and is also aware of the Grandfather Paradox and the Butterfly Effect. Indeed these are all discussed (briefly) in the early part of the novel and are subsequently dismissed with (more or less) a blithe \\"what could possibly go wrong?\\". Off he goes to meddle in world affairs during a period when the world faced (i.e. never came closer to) nuclear armageddon, and resolves to save the life of the man who held the keys to the most powerful in history. Ten out of ten for ambition, Jake. Minus ten million for geo-political forethought.<br /><br />None of which is helped by King having put his \\"trousers of time\\" on upside-down. Traditionally, the concept states, one present spawns many futures (or one past spawns many presents - it amounts to the same thing). For King, however, one present is spawned (or, more correctly, adjusted) from an infinity of pasts which seems metaphysically arse-about-face to me. Well... maybe I have misunderstood the trousers concept and maybe the technicalities don't even matter; in the end, perhaps King's premise is simply there to advance the plot. It doesn't kill the story by any means, but, it is sufficiently shaky that I felt duty bound to knock a star off the rating with a \\"needs more work\\" note. Niffnegger did it better, in my opinion.<br /><br />As to the plot, there's a rich mix of a number of iconic time-travel themes here; the temporal displacement chills of The Time Machine, the action and pop-culture nostalgia trip of Back to the Future and even a bit of pan-temporal bonking (The Time Traveller's Wife). The love-affair-that-spanned-time-itself sub-plot does prove to be a bit of a distraction from the action, though. Top it all with the big-ol' Kennedy assassination thang, something that we Brits all know to be bit of a national obsession in the US. All of this piles on the interest and ensures that the story races along well enough (albeit in a rather linear fashion) and there's rarely a dull moment, which is just as well given the size of the book.<br /><br />There are a few rather nice little nods to his previous works; the fun is in spotting them, but I'll give you one for free - on his first trip to the past, Jake spots a red and white '58 Plymouth Fury...<br /><br />Characterisation. King's protagonists are frequently highly distinctive, being typical (even stereotypical) Americans; sincere, easy-going, idealistic and so-on (his villains are frequently stereotypical villains). I have to say that in this novel they are rather blander than usual, however. It's hard to put my finger on it but few of the characters really jumped off the page and grabbed me. Jake Eppings, the main protagonist, is typical and you know the sort: a High School English teacher, slightly faded jeans and a subdued sports coat over a light blue shirt. Bland haircut, plain face and an easy-going, unobtrusive manner. Most of the characters are like this and it makes them hard to identify with in the same way that one would expect of characters from other King works<br /><br />The prose is... well.. it's typical Stephen King. He's written a lot of books and we \\"constant readers\\" will be quite familiar with his style; polished and very readable. Of course, it's easy to criticise King (as so many do)... Yes, he pads his work out with huge quantities of \\"extraneous detail\\" and in 11.22.63 that results in a novel that is nearly (but not quite) 1000 pages long. I believe that this padding helps to paint a vivid picture of the setting within which he builds his story and given that this one is set (largely) in late 1950's America, that picture is a distinctive one. Yes, he slips all too easily into a somewhat irritating (to a European reader), folksy American idiom but then, he's an American folk author - what the hell do you expect?

0141195851|5.0|I'm going to need a second shelf soon, but I love these clothebound classics. It also makes for a great go-to gift from my husband for the small holidays :)
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase! It came on time and was in prefect condition! I was very surprised to find out when you squeeze the cover, it screams at you! We were thrilled by that!
B004X80QNG|4.0|I was reading the reviews and saw a lot of complaints about not syncing to Google calendar but if you sync Google to your stock calendar it should all work out just fine.    otherwise this app looks good for what its intended to do.  I like the customization options also.
1883217040|4.0|This is a very in depth view of the jazz theory, not recommended for beginners. It goes and take real examples from real recording and real players and analyze them, which is nicer than just exercises and fake song, etc.  My only complain is the spiral-bound of the book, it seems a bit weak, espeacially considering the book size (it has 522 pages!! it looks like a bible!)
B004X80QNG|2.0|This app does not show up in my app drawer to allow me an option to uninstall it. The app has lots of options, but come on, no uninstall option?
B004X80QNG|5.0|I usually don't review apps but I just downloaded this app since I use my calander just about everyday.  This app just seemed easier and more interesting to use. So I'm very happy with it. It synced with my Google calander with no problem. I'm using HTC G2.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app.  Excellent graphics, nice size cards for my HTC Inspire.  I purchased another solitaire game prior to getting this one.  Installed the one from another vendor, keeping this one! Highly recommend!
B004X80QNG|4.0|Only a couple of things I would like to see in the app. The first is a widget that includes a way to filter items, as well as an option to display tasks. The second is not as important to me and that is syncing with Outlook. Otherwise it is easy to use, quick, and so far a great app.
B005URRCUY|4.0|El Camino isn't the guitar heavy, blues infused music that early Black Keys albums were. What it is though is pure fun, catchy, upbeat music. A plesant change from Brothers, which was slower and heavier hearted. It seems obvious that the success of \\"Howlin' For You\\" played a part in decideding the mood of this disc. My one suggestion for anyone buying this cd is leave all your preconcieved notions of The Blacks Keys at the door. What they were should NOT determine how good they are now. This is a common problem in society today. People want a group to stay what they started out as or what attracted them to that group. The Black Keys first three albums are amazing rock albums without a doubt and it's extremely suprising, if not depressing to me that this group didn't blow up until a song like Howlin' For You. However, this doesn't change the quality of this cd and the great music that it contains. I pride myself in enjoying music and not holding a group to limitations musically. I think if a group evolves in a good way, which for the moment I feel the Black Keys have, as long as it's good music that's all that counts! Highlights: THE ENTIRE CD!!

B004X80QNG|3.0|pretty good app only problem I can see with it is there is no widget for it. hard to believe that someone would spend all this time and not make a widget. now this is on a photon so maybe there is one on other phones
B004X80QNG|3.0|Pocket Informant on the Kindle Fire is a worthwhile app if all you need is an independent calendar that doesn't talk to the rest of the wired world.  However, if you are looking for a calendar application that can sync with Google Calendar then this app isn't for you.  Hopefully in a future software release, Amazon will update the Kindle Fire to allow entry and store of login information for services other than Amazon.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a free app so expectations were not high. But it has good graphics and can be localized by zip code. Accuracy?  At least as good as the local talking head.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Nice app but I need to be able to sync with my Google Calendar on my Kindle Fire. This app has a lot potential. I like the GTD system tie in. Thanks Amazon for offering this as the Free App of the Day.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I was a longtime user of PI on other devices and was happy to see it as the free app of the day.  It works very well on my Toshiba Thrive (outstanding actually) and Samsung GII. Syncs with Google flawlessly.  A widget would be nice, especially for the tablet.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I was disappointed in the cover Amazon offers for the Kindle Fire. The cover for my old Kindle was pretty textured fake leather with a built in light. Looked good and SO functional!   This one is essentially a plastic box with a cheap-looking cover on it.   In terms of functionality, I'm not sure I need more. The Fire doesn't, for example, need a light. Maybe it could have a stylus (I have fat fingers so it's hard to do many things without a stylus). Ok, maybe we don't need a stylus. But it would be nice if the cover had more style.   There's nothing WRONG with this cover, it's just kind of ugly and feels cheap to me. But I feel I need SOMETHING to protect the device so I guess this is it for now.  Dave
B0056BMK6K|5.0|\\"How I sold a million eBooks....\\" is a great book for anyone who is trying to make it in the indie publishing business. John Locke is clear form the beginning. This is a business and those who want to succeed in it are going to have to treat it as such. There is more information that I felt I could use than any other book that I have read on the subject...and I have read quite a few. I would recommend this short, but powerful book to all indie writers. Your results may not be the same, but I believe that if one would put some of this to use, their actions in this regard could create an increase in sales of eBooks. This was exactly what the intention was. Thanks John! Point well-taken!
B003AVPV1O|5.0|I was getting neck aches from typing sideways...  I needed a way to have two displays at 90 degree angles in my work space.  I thought I'd have to buy a second graphics card to power my second monitor.  But if all you need is the same display on both monitors this is the ticket.  Works great.
0321704452|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The Naked Presenter,\\" and thought it was a relatively quick read. I chose to read this book because I thought it would cover presentation skills, which I feel I am lacking in. Presenting is not something I like to do, and I hoped this book would offer some insight on how to calm my nerves a bit. I think the two key takeaways on how to do this are: 1) think of a presentation as a conversation, and 2) be yourself.  The author has some interesting views on preparation of a presentation that I have never thought of. I tend to start putting together Power Point slides as I create the presentation rather than sitting down in a quiet place and hammering it out on paper first, as he suggests doing. Reynolds also recommends defining the \\"why\\" rather than \\"what\\" when identifying the purpose of your presentation, which really makes sense if you think about it, and in a way, goes hand in hand with knowing your audience. You must first understand why people want to attend your presentation, and then build the \\"what\\" around the \\"why.\\" I was taken a little off guard by the author saying to not have an agenda slide. However, I did like his idea of instead having a slide that shows \\"sections,\\" and making them visually proportional to how long you plan on spending on each topic during the presentation.   When giving the presentation, I found that some of the tips he gave were pretty obvious like to arrive early to set up the room, and to not stand behind a podium if at all possible. I did enjoy reading the section on keynote speech tips taken from Steve Jobs, who I believe is one of the great presenters of our time. I also thought Reynolds' idea on shifting gears every 10 minutes was a good suggestion, and am glad he included ideas on how to mix things up. People tend to get bored easily, especially when sitting still listening to someone.
0307891372|5.0|This book was absolutely filled with plenty of information. After going over the views before purchasing the book I worried that the text would be too small to read. However, I did not have any problem with being able to see the text. Yes it was small but if you are young and have good eyes there should be no problem. Other than the small text the information is very helpful.
0061969656|5.0|On its own, DEATH OF KINGS is a good book. In the context of Bernard Cornwell's Saxon series, it is outstanding.   Here we have many of the same joys we've read in the previous books. Uhtred is likable for his courage, industry and faithfulness (however reluctant). Ninth-century Britain is rendered in real colors of mud, filth and death. Battles are detailed enough to be evocative and believable, but Cornwell has enough art in him that these passages do not dominate or bog down.   We are also treated to Uhtred's growing cunning. He feints, double-crosses, lies, deceives--even to the point of fabricating a holy shrine. Because of these abilities, he ultimately is able to see through the deceptions aimed at him, though often only in the nick of time.   The most fascinating aspect of these books is how Uhtred bridges the gap between Alfred's laws, learning and structure, and the opportunism and ambition of the Danes. He is the linchpin in the story of Alfred and the nascent English state, and I am glad that further installments of this series will come.
B002JIEYKS|5.0|I just finished reading Tony Iommi's bio, so I know all the circumstances that surrounded the writing and recording of this album. I first bought \\"Never Say Die\\" on 8-track, then vinyl, then finally CD... so you have some idea of how long I've lived with it... I know that Tony was very disappointed in the album- In that it lacked continuity, mostly. Not knowing any of the band history back in the late 70's, I picked this one up randomly... Unaware of the band's previous work, line-up changes, drug abuse, and band politics... & I couldn't stop playing it!!! From the commercially viable title track to the sentimental \\"Junior's Eyes\\" to the dark, heavy \\"Shock Wave\\" and even the oddball ballad \\"Air Dance\\", I thought this album was a work of art! I just don't get how this album gets dismissed by so many people... including the band themselves...? Stepping back and looking this as a collection of songs, rather than what this band was \\"supposed to sound like\\" at this particular point in time, yields a brilliance never seen in the Ozzy-era... with perhaps \\"Sabotage\\" as an exception. Those people who think that only the first 4-5 Sabbath albums are worth your time... aren't worth your time. Think of this as what it is: Tony Iommi taking over the band's sound (because otherwise the band would have collapsed) and taking Sabbath in a new direction. That direction?... \\"Heaven & Hell\\"- One of the greatest albums of all time... What he needed was a good singer/song writer to work with. (R.I.P. Ronnie) TONY! Cut yourself some slack. This was a great one! ~ If you don't think \\"Iron Man\\" was the best song ever written, pick this one up. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

0375751513|3.0|In the course of his career Oscar Wilde, an Irish writer and poet known for his epigrams and more notably as one of the most popular playwrights in London in the late 1800's,  wrote only one solitary novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.<br /> Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.<br />The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.<br />Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy.lity but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt.

B004HD2ZIQ|3.0|I'm really sorry to say but this record has no good songs on it. Definitely no classics.<br /><br />By good songs I mean good riffs, catchy hooks and good vocal lines.<br /><br />Motorhead have usually put out one or two good songs per record in the past. Sadly this record doesn't have any such tracks.<br /><br />Both Inferno and Kiss of Death had some good tracks 'Terminal Show' stands out.<br /><br />Additionally, the sound of this record is HORRID.<br />SUPER compressed and then BRICKWALLED to death. Doesn't sound pleasing to the ear at all. there's ZERO dynamics in the mix.<br /><br />Motorhead wanted to be the loudest band in the world at one point. If that was their sole ambition I'm sure they've done it this time.<br /><br />The recording sounds less like Motorhead and more like some modern metal band with Lemmy's voice on it.<br /><br />So, if you're new to Motorhead, listen to the samples and see if you dig what you hear. If you want a recommendation, buy the Best of \\"All the Aces\\" or \\"Ace of Spades\\".<br />\\"Ace of Spades\\" is their best song and they've not topped it in over 32 years.<br />If you're an old fan like me, buy it for the band and hope they'll put out a better one next time.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I just got my first DSLR and decided to try this backpack.<br /><br />The bag itself seems to be OK for the job but the simple fact that those zippers (all of the zippers) have the Amazon logo on them... makes me feel like an Amazon employee or something. I'm sure people will think you got the backpack from working at Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway... on a more serious note: I'm not sure if I'll ever travel with this backpack. It's very easy to open/close, so if you need a \\"secure\\" backpack then you need to spend some more cash (you get what you pay for really)<br /><br />I'll update this review after a few months of use.

B00267QOEQ|4.0|First, I must mention that this is more of a review of the Blu-ray release than the movie itself.  If you like Adam Sandler and enjoy his slapstick humor, you'll love this movie.  Also, I normally only double-dip from DVD to Blu-ray for action films, or movies I consider to be classics.  However, the DVD version I had for The Waterboy was not in anamorphic widescreen, and as a result, I had to use a stretch mode on my TV to get it to fill up the screen - this looked horrible.<br /><br />Thus, I opted to upgrade to the Blu-ray version. I have to say, this release was impressive.  The colors on the players' uniforms pop, and the soundtrack is awesome in DTS!  There's a lot of bass from the heavy body slams of Bobby Boucher when he tackles the other football players, and the roars of the crowds during the Bourbon Bowl scenes will literally engulf you.  There are a number of things you might notice which you may not have noticed before.  There's MUCH more visible detail in the shots in the bayous.  Also, I never realized that Farmer Fran had nipple rings!  I just about rolled on the floor laughing when I saw this.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?<br />My only reason for docking a star here is that, when you rewind or fast-forward during the movie, there's an annoying still clip of the chapter that appears just above the timeline.  This may be a minor nuisance to some, but it annoyed me just enough.<br /><br />All said though, this release is certainly worth the upgrade - highly recommend!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing. Before I read these books I would be lost when someone asked me what my favorite book was. But now I will enthusiastically shout out &#34;THE HUNGER GAMES!&#34; If your into thrilling adventure with a bit of romance these books will have you on the edge of your seat from the first page until the last. However I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone under 12 because there is alot of death, sad occurances, and a small amount of suggestive language that might be hard for a child to process. THIS TRILOGY IS AWSOME.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|My son Love headsets! Very comfy the first couple hours, but must remove from ears after using a couple hours dued to pinching ears and even sweating! My son is a small frame of only 65lbs teenager. So this was shocking to hear his ears sweat. Overall this was the only down fall. His headsets produce top quality sounds with a control on his cord to control volume of players voice, his voice & game. We give these a 9- thnx Amazon for quick shipping.
B0057A6GA6|4.0|This is one of the best tower games out there but it does play itself out and is not the easiest game to play on the market.

It would also be nice if you had more choices for weapons on most levels.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|While its not Rust in Peace or Peace Sells this is a fantastic follow up to the Endgame album. I am really happy with the line up. The first listen thru not a lot of songs stood out except for Never Dead. But after a few listenings, the great tracks stood out. Just like all their records they have maybe 75-80% of the album that is just fantastic and a couple other songs that are forgettable. But even those forgettable songs are pretty good. I look forward to seeing their next album.

B003Y5H57E|2.0|The biggest appeal of CRAZY STUPID LOVE is its wonderful cast of talented actors,. What could be better than a movie with Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon? Sounds like a cast created in heaven yet this magical casting totally falls apart in a totally predictable and tedious story.  We've seen this story over and over again. The marriage of a seemingly perfect middle-aged couple falls apart. Steve Carell again plays his typical nerdy, insecure but strangely loveable chracter. He's the jilted husband unsure of what went wrong. Enter sexy hunk and notorious lady man Ryan Gosling who offers to teach his older friend the ways of the world. Gosling's character is an over the top, somewhat sleazy, ladies man who spends his evenings in the bars picking up woman. It's not hard to guess who he ends up with.  The story goes wrong from the beginning. It's hard to respect characters who don't respect their fellow human beings.  I expected a fun and silly comedy but it was a big disappointment all the way.

This book isn't an action pack(and I do love kick butts girls) and some facts are missing for this world the author created to make more sense.

0375703764|5.0|Most reviewers that didn't enjoy House of Leaves seem to be disappointed about it being gimmicky - that as soon as they \\"got it\\" that there wasn't anything of substance left.  The reason why these reviewers are disappointed is because they don't understand how books work. Not this book specifically, but all books. They are making the fatal mistake of somehow assuming that every text has one shimmering truth that you have to grasp, and a good book gives you regular portions until everything has become clear.   This is a really dumb mistake.  House of Leaves is not perfect; nothing is. But if you approach it like some silly little puzzle that it is within your power to crack, then you will never extract any joy from its pages. Read the book like you would any other. When the book requires you to choose what to read or what not to read, revel in the choice and move on. When you don't know what the book is doing, sit and think about it instead of hopping onto google and asking the collected, clamoring, and self-important voices what their shallow and insipid interpretation was.  If you want the book to mean anything, just read it and allow yourself to become truly lost for a while. Maybe you'll enjoy it.

B005HP2JAM|1.0|So, I saw this movie while on vacation in London.  It was playing at the theater around the corner and my wife and I thought it would be interesting.  As we left the theatre we were literally laughing at how bad it was.  At one point they get a French perfume smeller (that really was his job) to sniff the air looking for evidence of caves or something. And they show the exact same cave drawings about 20 times from different angles to make the movie long enough for the theater.  It was interesting for about 5 minutes, but by the 11th or 12th time looking at a cave drawing of an elephant or something my brain had gone numb.  And to top it off...the ending isn't even about the drawings.  It is about some white alligators that live near a nuclear power plant and the author wonders aloud, \\"what will they think?\\", referring to the freakin alligators.  There is nothing that can justify you wasting money on this.  The only reason to get this is to show someone else how flabbergastingly ridiculous this film is.

This snaps around the Kindle fire on all sides and the back, and openings for all access points on the Kindle.  If you have a kindle, you'll need this.
B004LWZW2E|2.0|Insidious is horror for 13-year-old girls and people who think Suspiria \\"wasn't really that cool\\"...      This movie was a down right failure from the jump. Piss poor acting. Genre cliché after cliché. Some of the cheesiest dialogue sequences in the history of cinema. And the shame of literally lifting entire scenes from POLTERGEIST. These are just the beginning of a laundry list of issues that plagued this somewhat hyped horror release from the same two ass clowns that brought us SAW, and some art school drop out who gave us that other idiot ghost movie with the [expletive] acting that ripped off some other [expletive] movie and blah blah blah... ahhh [expletive] it. This is as predictable as predictable gets and more effective scares could be found in an episode of the Jersey Shore.      I didn't enjoy any aspect of this movie. Everything about the premise to me is either flawed or just downright retarded. You do not develop any sense of connection to the characters, so i ended up not really giving a [expletive] what happened to poor little annoying Dalton or his forgettable family. Woven in between ridiculous diatribes on corny metaphysical theories you are bombarded with dated and tired scare tactics that look as if they were made for an art school project by a moody emo kid. And the final blow to this absolute [expletive] storm of a horror flick, is the \\"big twist\\" at the end is revealed as... you know what if you still wanna know what it is, please, go see it. Cause you are probably going to love this film and you already think i'm some kind of elitist [expletive] who [expletive] hates on everything cause im a bitter old stubborn douche bag. Well i am. So go [expletive] off and waste another 103 minutes of you pathetic and pointless existence and watch the [expletive] out of Insidious.      In closing I would like to make a public service announcement: Comparing this movie to genre heavy weights THE EXORCIST and POLTERGEIST is an insult to both afore mentioned films and true fans of well-made horror.      Grades: Acting: C- [lead roles were pathetic], Story: D [for sheer stupidity and lack of originality], Cinematography: C+[for some stylish edits albeit nothing groundbreaking], Music/Score: C [low sounds followed by HIGH PITCH sounds] Scares: C [yeah we get it, scary dude in the corner, weird noises...right] Overall: C- and that's being [expletive] generous. Wake up Hollywood and release ANYTHING with a grain of integrity. Please.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Two thumbs up for everything!  I downloaded without first checking the reviews, as is my normal routine and I am not disappointed!  I love the variety of drawing tools, color and paper.  The GUI is easy to learn and use; it outperforms all other drawing programs that I've downloaded (and deleted).  This app is a keeper!
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Romance movie about destiny and love that's just meant to be.  Purchased this movie because upon looking at my DVD shelf I couldn't believe I didn't own it.  Its one of my favorite movies.  One of those movies that just makes you feel good as if all is right in the world.
B004X80QNG|1.0|When installed on the Kindle Fire, this app doesn't sync with Google Calendar - it only works as a standalone application. Without sync, this app is pretty useless.
B004X80QNG|3.0|I don't know about the rest of you but a widget is a must in a calendar/personal organizer. I don't see what this calendar can do for me that the pre-installed calendar feature on android can't
B004X80QNG|3.0|I was excited to find an app that keeps my calendar as well as tasks. The interface is great and easy to use. The biggest drawback is the lack of a widget. I like my calendar on the homescreen and without the widget I need to open the app each time I want to view my calendar. This would be a 5 star rating if the widget was an option.
B006CLTFP2|3.0|I am sure it was hard to pick which songs would make the CD after 4 seasons. I like it but I feel it could have been better. I really wanted to hear No Milk Today & Coal War by The Forest Rangers and Mary by Patty Griffin. Maybe we can hope for a Volume 2. You do not have to be a fan of the show to enjoy the music.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Purchased this item for a Christmas present.  I know my brother will love the movie.  Received the item in plenty of time and within the time I was told it would arrive.  I would order from this person again.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|While there's no questioning his talent, sometimes it seems that Buble has struggled to find his niche in a niche that's there for the taking.  Artists are notorious for ultimately coming out with a Christmas collection or two, and some seem to just phone it in....not Buble.  This is a well crafted, mixed and engineered collection of holiday music that lets Buble do what he does best - sing.  Finally, a Buble album that combines warm and inviting arrangements that offer something new and mix well with his pure and complete vocal renditions.  This is a mature album that finally seems to depart from the just standard standards that he's delved into in the past.  I've always thought Buble has shined with original music primarily because he can pull it off.... why just sing standards when you can create a new standard and do it your way (pun intended).  Like Everything and I Just Haven't Met You Yet, Buble not only pulls off a wonderful original, he embraces a song with a great hook and a delightful arrangement to pour a little soulful elegance to an up tempo ballad on Cold December Night.  Ordinarily, this might stick out like a sore thumb on an album of known and mostly known classics, but it doesn't.  It melds perfectly with the overall concept and frankly, it's his best work, ever.  This is an album you can put on in the back ground for some holiday baking or have on in the car, and you'll find you're willing to listen from start to finish - never disappointed.  From the first song \\"It's Beginning to Look Alot Like Christmas\\" you're hooked, and his renditions are strong, confident works.  The duets don't even disappoint, and it's stated that way because so often on these types of albums, they really do.  Both Jingle Bells (even with its hokey throwback to the crooner and his girls - Hey ladies - schtick and White Christmas with Shania Twain are really delightful expositions, with Buble seizing the moment, not overdoing it, and finding the right balance of vocal passion and musical compliment.  He doesn't over sing anything.  The only song that might give pause is a sort of revision of Santa Baby, but he pulls it off.  It, alone, lacks a smooth mixture of voice and arrangement.... it can be a bit off-putting to hear, Santa, Buddy.... but here he avoids the over-sing and the song almost takes on an old time radio feel, which is ultimately about right.    Ave Maria has been done, and done well, by many.  Here, Buble sings his heart out and lets his voice do the work as opposed to relying upon an upswell of musical accompaniment to do the work for him.   The album ends with the Spanish Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad, another duet.  It's really good, and even though he doesn't carry the pronunciation off perfectly, again, the music doesn't overpower, and he serves up a right wonderful rendition with passion, grace, and ultimately fun.  For me, this is the first Buble album that, start to finish, actually showcases Buble completely.  There's no reliance on arrangement and \\"Big Band pizzazz\\" to carry him on any of the tracks.  The result is a truly wonderful holiday music collection that will add to your holiday enjoyment this year and for years to come.
B003TJR2HS|4.0|I have the White iPhone 4 with [[ASIN:B004N7D4HC OtterBox Universal Defender Case for iPhone 4 (Black Silicone & Hot Pink Plastic)]] and bought this adapter to use with my [[ASIN:B0040GWXG4 Panasonic iPod/iPhone Compact Clock Radio, AM/FM Radio, Dual Alarm and Clear Vision Sound (Black)]]. It does the job well. It fits perfectly into my phone with the case on & then into the clock radio. The sound works, the alarm works, it charges and all the features work fine. It does raise the phone up pretty high in the dock, making it seem a little unstable, but overall, I would recommend this product if you have a phone with a case that interfers with the docking of the phone.
B004X80QNG|5.0|It is even synching with my gmail account. I'm a Mom of 4 kids and a college student. I'm going to love this app!
B004X0XA82|5.0|Really liking this album.  If I had to tell you the \\"recipe\\" for this music, I'd say take the progressive, haunting style of the group, YES, add a helping of the harmonies of CSNY.  Then spice it up with the more modern, folky Decemberists,  just a splash of the group, America, and maybe even a pinch of Simon and Garfunkel.    The only problem I have with them is that I'd like to see more instrumental passages, but the harmonies more than make up for that.  That's what defines this album.  Beautiful.    If you like those groups above, a good place to start is the song Sim Sala Bim.  I think it's the best of the album.  Go anywhere from there.  It's all addicive.
B004EPYZPS|1.0|Another movie where the government is the bad guy. The monster, which kills people and hangs them upside down, however, is just misunderstood. Plus, the plot is a badly disjointed patchwork of ideas stolen from \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\"  \\"E. T.\\" , \\"Jaws\\" and Stephen King's \\"Tommyknockers.\\". Save your money.
B000092ZYX|5.0|wow. this cd is really good. i always put in the bends, ok computer, or kid a before this one and kinda left it behind if u would say. silly silly me for doing that. i listend to this disk again for the first time in awhile and was plesantly suprised how amazing it was. is it a classic? no. is it an amazing cd full of texture, depth, and talent? indeed it is. i highly recomend buying this album. u cant go wrong with it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|make my own song recordings and listen to many out of market stations! fantastic app. love TuneInPro! can make my own Mp3s.
B004NSULHM|4.0|at first i liked this cd but didnt think it was anything super special,...until tonite when i played it with some headphones on. all the little sounds goin on in the background and how this record is produced is what makes it so good in my opinion. i would deffinitly start with the bends then work your way up to this one. u gotta have a music kind of mind to understand and appretiate this cd or any radiohead cd for that matter. i recommend buying this album. it wouldnt hurt anyones collection of cds.
0380973839|5.0|Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles is a Fantastic collection of short stories that explore a possible future for humans on Mars. Bradbury's novel is effective on portraying its mosaic of human experiences by utilizing heavy structural divisions and juxtaposing various characters and groups.   The Structure of The Martian Chronicles relies on a series of short stories that are closely or loosely woven together by a common setting and timeframe to show a wide variety of human problems and relationships. Bradbury uses this structure to add in stories like Usher II and There Will Come Soft Rains that carry important messages about society as well as complement other stories but are not necessary for the overall plot. It also allows Bradbury to focus on small groups of people in extremely varied situations without needing to fully explain the run up of events or the consequences of their actions. This allows Bradbury to show more situations that   demonstrate the human experience.     The core of The Martian Chronicles is that it shows what people can become and both the good and bad of what they do through character juxtaposition. One such example of this is the Briggs-Spender relationship which is designed to compare those who want to make a new earth and those who want to conserve the old Martian landscape. The most important juxtaposition in the novel is between the Humans and Martians. Bradbury is able to expose flaws in human thought and action by pairing them with non-human life. The comparisons stretch from the start of the book at Ylla and go to The Off Season. The novel explores peoples' greed, paranoia and bigotry as well as our ability to build and destroy through our relationship with the Martians.      The final component of what makes The Martian Chronicles an effective novel and a great read is that it shows how the problems that exist today could carry on in the future in a way that people can still identify with them. Issues ranging from racism, religion, and colonialism are depicted along with their consequences. The most clear-cut example is the issue of colonialism, which is heavily addressed throughout the human settlement of Mars.     It is important that those who have previously read the Martian Chronicles to know that different editions contain slightly different stories and dates. More modern editions omit the Way In The Middle Of The Air and older editions may omit Usher II and or The Fire Balloons.    -Alicia, Dante, Kevin, Lucas, Sara
1451627289|5.0|I loved this book!  Thank you Stephen King for such a wonderful story - I enjoyed every bit of this tale.
0060899220|5.0|I totally loved this book! If one is a foodie, a gourmand, or lover of memoirs, one will thoroughly enjoy this rollicking, insider's account of the restaurant industry and how the author ended up as a highly respected chef who is a passionate about food.<br /><br />This is a well-written, thoroughly enjoyable and informative book, replete with self-deprecating humor and any number of quirky and crude characters that can be found in the belly of the beast known as the restaurant industry. It is an eye-opening and engrossing book that will keep the reader riveted until the very last page is turned.
B005KJZDXK|2.0|I generally enjoy both of these artists separately and together so I was disappointed with this outing.  The style and arrangement feels contrived.  This album doesn't bring anything fresh to the songs.
B002HFWAWW|5.0|Saw this movie with my friends without knowing what it was about. We were in awe. I remeber saying, \\"This guy should be the next Batman.\\" It just seemed so obvious. About 2 years later we hear 'Batman Begins' is filming and who do your think was the lead? This also started my belief that Sean Bean never gets through any of his movies alive. Of that I have been proven wrong but it is still a handy rule of thumb that will usually apply.<br />All in all, I think this is one of those well made films that shows that you don't need a hundred million dollars to make a great action movie, just a good director with a solid vision and a talented crew to help him realize it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for! Protects my screen so I can carry it in my bag without adding additional weight or bulk.  The stand works perfectly too.  It is also well made.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen king has done it again! This book is an amazing written work of art.The writer takes you there with the power of his words. I could not put it down for a second!
B004X80QNG|1.0|This application does not sync with google calendar. Misled by product description , what a waste of my time. Will re review when fixed.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Purchased this to use within our limited space. Didn't work at all! Would not even see my feet during the game Wipeout. My legs were moving very erratically when I was standing completely still. At first had it on top of my TV and trying to use my hand to get through screens was impossible since it didn't stay in one place long enough. Moved it to beneath the TV and the hand sensor was alot better, but still couldn't see my feet. I am definitely returning tomorrow!
B001UHOWXI|4.0|I bought the 2007 restored release (B&W and color) and it was extremely impressive then.  So when I saw all the glowing reviews for the Blu-ray, I finally took the plunge and picked it up.  Was it worth it?  The B&W version looks about as expected, twice the resolution of the 2007 release.    The Blu-ray color version looks about the same as the 2007 restored color DVD version.  So if you are a huge fan of the movie and you want the highest resolution, get the Blu-ray on sale. If you're a fan who already has the restored verion, and the highest resolution is not that important (after all, it's not a big budget action flick with surround sound), then save your money.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have a couple of different cases. This is by far my favorite. The cover helps you hold your kindle in almost any position. It's ability (the cover) to double as a stand works perfectly. You can even stand it up on your chest while lying down to watch movies w/o using your hands. I am shocked there are low reviews for this product. It's simply great, form and function.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Very enjoyable and has a few new songs on it.. He is really quite good and fun to listen to.
B00062J00S|5.0|To those of you, who, like me, have watched this a hundred thousand times, why do we do it?<br /><br />I mean, it's way too long and stylistically confused; starting off sentimental and romantic and compellingly real before turning into a prototype Twilight Zone with the introduction of Clarence Oddbody.  The ending is heartfelt but somehow feels incomplete and wrong.<br /><br />Why is this movie - which in fact tanked at the box office and was more-or-less shrugged off by the critics at the time - such a classic?  Is it only because we've been told for decades that It's A Wonderful Movie Classic so we're supposed to automatically shut up and not judge?<br /><br />Of course not.  It's a classic not thanks to its erratic narrative, but to how well the sincere performances and Frank Capra's precision as director hold this weird mix of styles together.  Jimmy Stewart's range of emotions and passions, plus Donna Reed's incomparable blend of sweet and sexy, are still two of the finest performances in the history of movies, and wonderful lessons to any aspiring film actors.<br /><br />There are enough great scenes in it...Mr. Gower smacking young George around then doing an immediate about-face on realizing his serious error...these are all Pavlov-type moments that just Do It for me, forever and always.  Even if we only keep seeing our favourite bits each year instead of the whole damned thing, it's enough, don't you think?<br /><br />Filmmakers take heart: you don't have to be perfect, because this ain't.<br /><br />But God, it's good.  Because It's A Wonderful Cast.<br /><br />Merry Christmas, you Wonderful Old World!!

0756404738|5.0|I am very pleased with Patrick Rothfuss's newest work and highly recommend it to anyone. I devoured the book and I was ready for more.  It is hard to wait for the third book!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|highly recommended. much better than other apps in its category. it was one of the first apps I searched for when I purchased the kindle fire. glad to see that it is finally available.
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|I CAN'T REVIEW THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF HAVING TO BUY COMBO PACKS.WHEN IT COMES OUT ON BLU-RAY BY IT SELF I MIGHT BUY IT.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Very nice app.  Keep up the good work!  Love the different effects and silly pictures we've taken.  Would definitely recommend it! :)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I'm 61 and still enjoy my rock/indie/pop music. Been a Keys fan since Rubber Factory, introduced to me by my son-in-law. This is an instant classic. Not a weak sister on the album. Black Submarine hooked me on the first listen, like a Led Zep or Yardbirds or Kinks or Who classic, had a little Jack White feel to it. I'll be up too late tonight listening to it. As at least one other commented, it is just too short; many of the songs end too soon! Anxious to hear extended versions of Black Submarine, Lonely Boy, etc.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|I loved one and two and this one had a lot of new things and those guys flying off the building was great. really cool movie
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I'm really just not a fan of Christmas music. It drives me crazy, call me the Grinch if you wish, but I just don't dig it. However, after realizing that one of the songs played at my work was by She & Him, I decided to check out their Christmas CD. Perhaps it's because I'm in love with their music. Zooey's voice is magical to say the least. Their CD has put me in the Christmas spirit. Love, love, love it!
B000001F45|3.0|Uriah Heep was, at their best, a B to B+ type of rock and roll band.<br />At their best, they offered strong songs with fanciful lyrics and great guitar tone.<br />But when they were bad - they were awful. Think overly distorted keyboards and embarrassing multi-part falsetto vocal harmonies.<br /><br />This album is from their \\"golden era\\" for lack of a better term and features what most consider their 'classic' lineup.<br /><br />\\"Sunrise\\" is probably the best song on the CD and carries an ominous feel throughout from beginning to end. Mick Box's guitar work is relatively simple here but comes across as very heavy and, as always, his tone is great.<br /><br />The title track is within the \\"Spinal Tap\\" vein but it's GOOD Spinal Tap ; )<br />I've always thought of the title track as a nice escape from reality and I've always enjoyed wandering through the multiple parts that were assembled into this one, long, epic tune.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the CD is filler, quite frankly although I'll admit that the pseudo-medieval feel to some of the songs has grown on me over time.<br /><br />If you like Uriah Heep or are interested to learn more about them; this one should be in your collection.
B00631VJIC|4.0|I watched the first two seasons of this show in a few weeks on NetFlix and I began to notice the excellent background music. I can't say as I had ever heard of Katey Sagal or Audra Mae before (or any of the other artists on the album) but I do love all of the songs. It is a great album of mostly(?) covers that I really enjoy.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I rented this movie and thought it was pretty funny. I wouldn't buy it or suggest paying more than a dollar to rent it though.
B005KDWUFA|4.0|when the El Divo voices are heard one could become enchanted...sometimes the music is louder than the men and that cost the cd one star!
B0034G4P8A|2.0|i throught it was cheap it;s start out great then it turns sour , morden day thor then back since fiction , thats where i thought it got cheap ,,i would not recommoned this movie to nobody...........
B0002EXH5E|5.0|not the same sound as the old great megadeth albums, still very worthy of listening, highly recommended, if you like a good rock sound, buy this disc.
098357670X|5.0|For years, I was waiting...hoping...and praying that SOMEONE would make a book on caricature that would top How To Draw Caricatures by Lenn Redman.  Well, after YEARS AND YEARS of waiting and hoping, the GREAT Tom Richmond came through.  THIS... ladies and gentlemen...is the greatest caricature book EVER.  Period.  Besides the VERY FUNNY illustrations and instantly recognizable caricatures, Tom gives TONS of GREAT advice and guides to the craft.  Don't think that you'll pick up this book and BAM! You'll hit his skill level.  No, be prepared for LONG, HARD work if you want to be as HALF as good as he is.      IF YOU WANT TO LEARN CARICATURE, PICK UP THIS BOOK!!  IF AMAZON IS OUT OF STOCK, GO TO TOM'S WEBSITE AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET ONE AUTOGRAPHED!
B006FE17Q6|4.0|i have no problem with this episode, very good ending, but the rest of the season 2 episodes concern me. i think there is too much drama and too many crying, sappy scenes. the walking dead has great potential, and the idea of a zombie apacolypse is not new, but the producers of this series have really taken initiative. however, i believe that the walking dead is NOT headed in the right direction. bottom line, less drama, more gore, and dont give up the show it is a very good idea<br /><br />*edit<br /><br />after the mid season finale things are looking much better. the new episodes that are being made are great.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|delivery was great. I can only listen to this music when I am in the mood for suicide from a love affair. She as a artist is great and inspiring but it is the Vagina Monlogues
B00006I53S|3.0|It is an old designed lens. For today it is unsatidfied in its mechanical performance. The lens is very easy to creep. I am tired to deal with it. So I have to return it.
B00005214X|5.0|glad to have this immortal cd in my collection and really miss George Harrison he was a gift to this world. Delivery was great.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|If you love the Blues and the music played on \\"House\\" you will love this CD, I hope he puts out more CD's like this.  Buy it you will not be disappointed!
0446573019|3.0|The story line was a good one but it took a long, long time to tell it. This could have been done more efficiently. The biggest problem for me was I thought that I was reading a Lee Child book about Jack Reacher most of the time and the Reacher books are just better. There's always room for one more hero but this was not as well done as I find those books to be. I've been a Baldacci fan for a long time and do read almost everything he writes. Let's call this a start an with more character development and finding that right mix the author can refine this into a winning combination.
1933633867|5.0|Graeber's \\"Debt\\" book may be one of the most important of this decade. One needn't have much interest in or knowledge of economics to enjoy and benefit from reading it. I didn't read all the anthropological parts (I may return to them later), but found even many footnotes not simply of interest but enlightening. The information presented needs to become more widely understood!
B00009NQQO|3.0|Bought for my 2yr old son and he likes to take the balls in and out of net. Like other reviews my right suction cup didnt want to stick but on closer inspection notice the edges of cup were bent in so if made sure flat when attaching and sticks fine.  The suction cups wont stick to porous/ceramic tile so have to hang top of tub which my son likes just as much.  This toy also sticks to fridge and he like to play with it there as well. Overall is decent toy for the price paid.
